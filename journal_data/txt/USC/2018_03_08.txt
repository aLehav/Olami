International Women’s Day is a culmination of all that Women’s History Month aims to celebrate: womanhood in its diverse forms. This year, especially on American college campuses, the global holiday comes just as students seem to be facing a reckoning with regard to feminism’s greater direction. 
This reckoning traces its origins to a predictable source: history. 
History is ridden with cases of gendered barriers being ignored — but it’s also ridden with activism and social consciousness being confined to gendered barriers, without acknowledgement of oppression’s intersectionality. Now, in our second year under an Education Department that is actively targeting or neglecting to protect widely targeted groups, today’s campus feminists must be proactive about expanding the dimensions of their advocacy. In conjunction with other forms of intolerance, sexism is often savagely exacerbated along the lines of race, ability,  sexual orientation and other identity-based facets. In treating misogyny as an isolated issue, we continue the long-standing historical record of sidelining diverse women.
In the last year, the Education Department under President Donald Trump has rescinded previous guidelines that called upon schools to allow students to use the restroom coinciding with their gender identity. Additionally, the department announced last month that it will no longer investigate complaints regarding trans and non binary students’ experiences with harassment and assault in restrooms. This demographic is notably more likely to be the victims of assault or harassment in restrooms, rather than the perpetrators. 
Additionally, this presidential administration’s repeated threats to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy has placed innumerable students in a state of fear and confusion that undoubtedly interferes with their academic experiences. On the national level, shifting immigration policies can have the effect of sending immigrant and refugee women back to abusive or dangerous households. 
Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
And affecting all women, the Education Department, seeming to collude with groups recognized by Southern Poverty Law Center as male supremacist groups, has rescinded guidelines that lowered the evidentiary standards for students who report assault. In doing so, the department not only advances but also codifies into policy the age-old, baseless suggestion that sexual assault is something survivors would be motivated to lie about. Notably, according to the latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 44 percent of lesbian women compared with 35 percent of heterosexual women experience rape or physical sexual violence in their lifetimes. Forty-seven percent of trans people are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes, and black and Native American women are more likely than women of any other racial group to experience sexual violence.
Yet another example of intersectional misogyny affecting college students comes in the form of the Trump administration’s repeal of the contraceptive mandate, a policy that acknowledged cost-free birth control coverage as a right regardless of the personal views of employers or insurers. Since taking effect in 2012, the contraceptive mandate enabled more than 55 million women to access copay-free birth control, and saved women $1.4 billion annually. According to a survey published last week by Small Business Majority, 74 percent of black women said the availability of contraceptives helped them pursue higher education.
In other words, there is work to be done, and this work extends beyond isolated understandings of gender. International Women’s Day must be more than a holiday of celebration, but a day of acknowledging past and present struggles.
In the United States, we may never be able to quantify how many women were stripped of economic opportunity, injured or even killed due to the federal illegality of abortion prior to 1973. We may never know how many women were victimized by insufficient sexual violence laws that resulted — and continue to result — in unspeakable atrocities. Within the past year, we repeatedly find ourselves faced with the question of how many women sexism has denied political office and representation. And just within the past months, we repeatedly find ourselves asking how many women have beeen denied advancement by exploitative and abusive men in positions of power. 
Despite some progress in lawmaking, stagnation in the implementation of these laws as well as violent backlash have rendered many of the aforementioned issues dire to this day. And in the vein of intersectionality, both history and modern scholarship tell us these struggles were and remain disproportionately shouldered by women of color, women with disabilities and LGBTQ people, all of whom suffer from higher rates of sexual violence, economic disenfranchisement and inability to access adequate health care.
Intersectional feminism must become normalized when we think of feminism. This International Women’s Day, we can celebrate how society is ultimately moving toward greater consciousness of forms of intolerance that have always existed, but seldom been recognized before. From this consciousness, we must move to recognize the inextricable interactions between every form of intolerance, and in addition to this recognition, engage in solidarity and action while being inclusive of everyone.

On Jan. 29, the California State Senate approved Senate Bill 320, a bill that requires public colleges in the state to offer non-surgical abortion services in their student health centers. The bill would require all four-year universities in the UC and CSU systems to provide drugs for medication abortions and be ready to administer them to students by 2022. 
Introduced in early 2017 by Chino Senator Connie Levyas, SB 320 was inspired by a campus resolution at UC Berkeley, and has since been supported by over 25 advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The California State Assembly still needs to vote on the bill, but given its Democratic majority, it’s relatively likely that the bill will be implemented.
The language of the bill only covers public schools, but as the idea of providing abortions in college health centers gains traction, private institutions like USC must consider the issue. In this instance, if USC truly cares about the health and well-being of its students, it should follow the example set by the UC system and move toward covering medication abortion in the Engemann Student Health Center. 
A non-surgical or medication abortion has proven to be objectively safe and effective at terminating unwanted pregnancies. The procedure involves a two-pill dosage of mifepristone and misoprostol, which are spaced out over 24 hours and produce a response similar to an early miscarriage. It can only be implemented in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy, and is around 95 percent effective. Though there is a risk of side effects and serious complications — as is true with many medications — the method has been used safely and legally in the United States for over 15 years, with serious adverse effects occurring in only 0.3 percent of cases.
USC’s health center itself directly addresses students in its mission statement by stating that it strives to “facilitate the completion of your academic career at USC by promoting healthy lifestyles and caring for your physical and psychological illnesses and concerns.” There are not many health concerns that are more common and would be more disruptive to an academic career than an unwanted pregnancy. 
Engemann already does a commendable job with providing multiple birth control options, gynecological treatments and testing for sexually transmitted infections. They even make getting an emergency contraceptive, or morning after pill, fairly simple. With all of the sexual health resources already available, it may not seem necessary to add early-term medication abortions to the mix. 
But abortions are far more common among the college-age population than many believe. On average, one in four American women have an abortion before they turn 45, and one in five have one before they turn 30. And more than half of those who received an abortion in 2016 were using at least one form of contraception, and nearly a quarter were using hormonal or long-standing contraception like birth control pills or an IUD, at the time of conception. 
The reality is that even when the IUD and the birth control pill are being used perfectly, they can fail 1 to 2 percent of the time. These forms of contraception can also mask early signs of pregnancy, which means that a pregnant person might not notice it until several weeks in. Emergency contraception pills only work up to five days after sex, so if initial contraception fails and the patient fails to notice, she  would be facing the choice between an abortion or carrying an unplanned baby to term — even though she was doing everything right to prevent pregnancy.
If the student chose to keep the baby, then more power to her. But consider if she wanted an abortion. Depending on their insurance, a first trimester abortion could cost between $350 and $950. Students at USC are lucky to be in a dense city where there is a Planned Parenthood less than a mile away and several women’s health clinics within a five-mile radius, but getting the procedure would still require scheduling around classes and work and organizing transportation to and from the clinic. An easy and confidential option for early abortion in Engemann, like the one outlined in SB 320, would be far superior and safer for students in a position like this. 
For the roughly 50 percent of the student population who are at risk for unplanned pregnancy, many levels of care should be in place to get them safe, shame-free medical care, so that they can stay in school, complete their academic goals and comprehensively plan their futures. Women and trans or nonbinary people who can get pregnant deserve to exercise their bodily autonomy safely and continue their education without an unwanted pregnancy stopping them. 
These levels of care start with education and access to contraception; the University has already committed itself to these options, which is a step in the right direction. Medication abortions have proven to be easy and safe to administer, and there is no reason that they should not be offered in the suite of birth control options already available on campus. Senate Bill 320 sets a noteworthy example of accessible, comprehensive health care on college campuses, and USC should follow suit — regardless of legislative mandates.

Over the past several years, the USC community has taken several steps to promote gender inclusivity and empowerment on campus. Placing the first major female statue of Hecuba at the center of the new USC Village could be seen as the symbolic pinnacle of the University’s progress, but there are many more tangible changes consistently happening to make the campus environment more inclusive, diverse and empowering. It only feels right to highlight some of these milestones on International Women’s Day, so read on for a quick timeline of some of the biggest occurrences in recent campus herstory.
February 2015: Sampath & Fowler become the first all-female ticket to be elected to USG
Former Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath’s historic victory extended beyond University Park, as she and her vice president became the first women to hold the top two student government positions on a campus in all of the Pac-12. Gender empowerment was one of Sampath’s primary platform points, and something she fought for throughout her term despite identity-based backlash.
August 2015: USC opens first gender-neutral housing options
New  calls for gender-neutral housing at USC began in Fall 2013, when the Queer and Ally Student Assembly and USG led an initiative to create a more inclusive housing community. Negotiations would stretch on for the next year and a half, until USC announced that gender-neutral options would be available both on and off campus. Since then, gender-neutral bathrooms have popped up in residence halls as well as other buildings, making campus a more welcoming place for everyone.
November 2015: USG passes campus climate resolution
Seeking to consolidate the demands and requests of students across campus, USG presented a campus climate resolution to University President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick in an open forum. Many of the items in the resolution revolved around a series of reforms to make campus more inclusive of marginalized groups, calling for the hiring of a vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion as well as an additional Title IX investigator.
January 2016: Gretchen Means appointed as Title IX Coordinator
In the midst of a federal Title IX investigation against USC in the wake of alleged mishandled reports of sexual assault and harassment, the school brought in Gretchen Means to strengthen the USC Title IX Office. Formerly an expert for sexual assault and complex litigation for the United States Marine Corps, Means brought several years of experience to the table, and seeks to change the culture on campus by making the Title IX Office more accessible and transparent.
February 2016: Campus climate coalition holds first meeting
After feeling their earlier resolution hadn’t sparked timely progress, members who proposed the resolution formed a campus climate coalition to discuss the best way to proceed. Splitting off into seven “working arms,” the coalition aimed to attack the issue from all sides, and met several times over the course of the year to host discussions and work on programing.
January 2017: Women’s Student Assembly changes name to Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment
Seeking to extend the WSA’s reach beyond cis women, USG voted unanimously to change the name of WSA and widen the available resources for transgender and gender-queer students. SAGE has been active on the empowerment front over the years, and recently brought artist Halsey and actress and activist Emily Ratajkowski to campus for their “INSPIRE: Arts & Music and Beauty” festival along with other groups on campus.
October 2017: Latino Student Assembly changes name to Latinx Student Assembly
Shortly after SAGE’s name change, the LSA opted to change its name as well with the goal of creating a more inclusive community that represented more of the population. The umbrella assembly oversees several smaller groups devoted to supporting USC students of Latinx descent, and programs a variety of events that highlight culture and encourage academic, professional and social growth.
August 2017: Hecuba statue unveiled in USC Village
Capping off the $700 million development project, USC decided to center the USC Village with the first female statue on campus, honoring Hecuba, the mythical Trojan queen married to the Trojan king Priam. At the ceremony, Nikias called the sculpture a symbol of the University’s commitment to the women of the Trojan Family, emphasizing Hecuba’s compassion and resilience during the Trojan War.
January 2018: USG passes resolution for free menstrual products
USG passed a resolution to expand complimentary menstrual products past the Engemann Student Health Center, increasing accessibility for students on campus. The motion passed with a unanimous 12-0 vote in a nod to  the University’s many female and menstruating students. The focus has now turned to figuring out the best way to implement the new policy, as USG looks to find a vendor who will supply the products in bathrooms throughout campus.

I used to lose sleep over Instagram captions. If that isn’t the most millennial thing you’ve heard said, let me reiterate: I would often spend nights tossing and turning over a witty one-liner soon to be read by my meager 400-something followers because I wanted my posts to scream “clever,” “amusing” and “cool.” 
I have a total of three and a half accounts all dedicated to showcasing various facets of my life. My main account is filled with heavily washed out photos of me and my friends shot in various locations. The second is my finsta (a portmanteau of fake and Insta) in which I aggregate a mess of pensive-looking selfies I’m too embarrassed to show the general public, and dark poetry I write in the wee hours of the morning. The third is a study account dedicated to showing off my calligraphy, stationery supplies and journal spreads. And lastly, the half account is a shared fan page I co-created with a pal 400 miles away in an attempt to nourish our long-distance friendship with memes and annoy all our mutual friends.
It sounds utterly excessive, but the fact that Instagram specifically has a function allowing you to toggle between multiple accounts at once indicates that my practices are not as uncommon as you might think. I used to agonize over the way my accounts displayed themselves and would often delete photos or deactivate my profiles altogether. While I don’t track my analytics or fixate on the follower to following ratio, my maintenance of a curated theme filled with long, thoughtful captions to accompany heavily filtered photos is borderline obsessive. Last month, I finally took the necessary step and deleted all social media apps, including Instagram, off my phone.
All my accounts point to the idea that I tend to compartmentalize various aspects of my life and present a specific version of myself depending on who my audience is. I struggled with striking a balance between seeming put-together yet genuine online. I scorned accounts that fixated on merely the good things, believing that they discredited all the gray areas life has to offer. However, I fell into the same traps that I ridiculed. I wanted people to see me in a specific light, and I wrestled with how to go about doing so.
Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
As a result, my main account reflected the few highlights I had to show. You know, the ones that made it seem like I was having fun all the time. When I realized how fake that looked, I crafted my finsta to counter it, priding myself on its teenage angst aesthetic. Still, I felt confined to the walls of the little squares that made up my feed because none of these were whole representations of me as a person. I wasn’t as happy as I seemed, nor was I constantly in the throes of an existential crisis. Things weren’t always one way or another. Accordingly, I felt compelled to churn out content for the masses that made me appear as if I was living my best life, yet still aimed for 100 percent realism. I wanted to be known beyond my online persona, but failed to see that the only way for someone to truly do so was by getting to know me in person.
I believe this is further indicative of how I present myself in general. I often have trouble opening up to people at first. I’ve been told I seem quiet, though my closest friends would contest that. I am a bit awkward (but still fun, I promise) and often bumble through my sentences, emphasizing my speech with erratic arm movements. Throughout my life, I’ve been labeled all sorts of things by people who have written me off by the less-than-stellar first impressions I leave. However, after I warm up toward someone I can then become more authentic. 
In short, what you see is not what you get from the start, which couldn’t be fully conveyed through my online presence. Social media merely gives fleeting glimpses into my life and never goes beyond a first impression, despite my attempts to depict my multidimensionalism. 
So until my 29,355 personalities reconcile with each other, I’ve chosen to stay offline and get some much needed shut-eye.

Hard work beats talent. This sentiment best summarizes USC sophomore catcher Blake Sabol’s attitude. Growing up, Sabol, like many other collegiate athletes, played multiple sports, competing in high school basketball and football alongside baseball. Despite his athletic diversity, Sabol knew from a young age that baseball was his sport.
Catcher Blake Sabol’s athleticism allows him to play nearly anywhere in the field. Daily Trojan file photo.
“You can’t just show up and be good at baseball,” Sabol said. “Whereas in football I was tall and fast so I was a pretty good wideout … it came easy to me.” 
It’s no wonder that Sabol embraced baseball as his athletic passion. Hailing from Aliso Viejo, Calif., Sabol’s family members aren’t strangers to the baseball world. His father, Rob played collegiate ball at Long Beach State University, and his older brother, Stefan played at the University of Oregon before joining the New York Mets Organization in 2012.
With both his father and brother as mentors, the 6-foot-4 catcher learned the importance of dedication at a young age. 
His father ensured that his three sons understood what it would take to become the best. Rob consistently went into work at 5 a.m. and wouldn’t get home until 5 p.m., but he always made time for his children.
“As soon as he got home he would pick me and my older brother up and we’d go down to the field and he’d work with us for an hour or two,” Sabol said. “He never complained once about having to wake up early or take us out there … He could’ve been another dad, where you just want to come home and just chill and watch football or something, but he always wanted us to do something greater with our lives and reach our dreams.” 
From that point on, Blake recognized the amount of dedication it would take to reach his professional baseball aspirations. It was the extra work and long hours that has helped him earn the many honors to his name. In his senior season of high school, Sabol was rated the class of 2016’s 23rd best player in the nation by MaxPreps and played club baseball for the No. 1 CBA Marucci, according to Perfect Game. Furthermore, his accomplishments are not limited to North American baseball. In 2013, Sabol competed for Team USA in the Pan AM game where he won gold.
“Playing for Team USA was one of the greatest experiences I’ve ever had in my life,” Sabol said. “It’s playing for something bigger than yourself and not even just a baseball team, I was playing for the country.”
Sabol’s high school accomplishments opened up many doors for his post-high school athletic aspirations. With interest from schools including Stanford, Vanderbilt and USC, Sabol had no shortage of opportunities to pursue a D-I collegiate baseball career. 
Since he first donned cardinal and gold for USC baseball, Sabol has found nothing but success. In his freshman season in 2017, he played in 40 out of 55 games, recording a .250 batting average and driving in 16 runs. Moreover, as a true freshman, he often took on the leadership responsibilities behind the plate. But perhaps Sabol’s true value comes from his athleticism and adaptability, which allows him to be effective in multiple positions. 
“One of the things he brings to the table is his athleticism, his versatility in that he can play in the outfield, he can play first, he can catch, he can DH, so there [are] a lot of opportunities for him,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. 
A player of Sabol’s caliber is surely an asset to any baseball team, especially to a young USC team coming off a disappointing 2017 season. So far in his sophomore season, Sabol has proven his value, primarily taking reps in the lineup as a designated hitter and in the field as a catcher. Through the first 11 games of the 2018 season, he has accounted for a .275 batting average (11 for 40), a .356 on base percentage and 6 runs batted in.
Sabol and the rest of the Trojans baseball team have found success early in 2018, tallying an 8-3 record and an important win to prove themselves over a No. 5-ranked Arkansas program last Saturday. This weekend, the Trojans will welcome a trio of baseball powerhouses — No. 8 TCU, No. 15 Vanderbilt and No. 11 UCLA — in the Dodger Stadium Baseball Classic.
“I think we proved this last weekend that we can play with anybody in the country,” Sabol said. “We were three outs from taking the series, but I think our guys aren’t content with that … If you look at our outfield wall, we are the ones with 12 National Championships under our belt. We’re still the top of the college baseball game and we are trying to get USC back up to where we belong.”
There is still a lot of the season left to be played, and Sabol and the Trojans are committed to making the most of their remaining games with the same hard working mentality and dedication Blake learned from his father.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
As the USC men’s basketball team prepares to begin play in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tournament against Oregon State on Thursday, it must do so knowing that a loss could put their NCAA Tournament hopes in jeopardy. And that would be an embarrassment.
It is true that head coach Andy Enfield has had to deal with a lot this season. The expectations were high right off the bat, with a No. 10 preseason ranking and some giving the Trojans a shot at making the Final Four. With all of their key upperclassmen returning and several NBA prospects on the roster, this was supposed to be the year that USC jumped from a program with simple March Madness goals to one with national championship aspirations.
But now, after a slew of controversies — replete with involvement in an FBI sting that resulted in the departure of De’Anthony Melton and the firing of associate coach Tony Bland — and untimely injuries, the Trojans find themselves in the same position as last season: fortunate just to be included in the 68-team field.
As it stands, the Trojans are projected by most to be part of the tournament. Their odds, though, are far from guaranteed after a disappointing loss to UCLA on Saturday at the Galen Center. The loss epitomized the season for USC: The Trojans had control of the game and should have won it, but could not close the deal. A win would have probably locked down a spot. Now, they’ll have to earn one in the conference tournament.
Consensus is that USC will need at least two wins in the Pac-12 Tournament to satisfy the committee. There is a new format this year to choose teams for the tournament, a format that splits a team’s wins into four quadrants that vary based on difficulty and whether the win came on the road or at home, with Quadrant 1 wins being the most valuable. It will take up too much space to explain the system, but just know this: USC could use a few more Quadrant 1 wins on its resume.
This is why the team will need at least two wins in the Pac-12 Tournament. Beating Oregon State will do little to move the needle. USC should hope that Utah reaches the semifinals so that a win would give the Trojans another Quadrant 1 win. The Trojans already beat Utah this year on the road, and they’ll be playing at a neutral site this time. 
If the stars align and USC beats Utah, they should be in decent shape. From there, a victory in the Pac-12 Championship, which would guarantee a spot in the tournament, would be the cherry on top.
What happened to USC’s basketball team this season is similar to what happened to the football team in that both only have themselves to blame for their troubles, yet were victims of a supposedly weak Pac-12. 
In football, the Trojans were passed over for a spot in the College Football Playoff despite having the same amount of losses as Ohio State. But they were docked for posting “easy” wins against bad teams in their own conference. 
The Pac-12 also does not have the best reputation in basketball. Of the 12 teams, only two — Arizona and USC — have much of a national profile, and both are entangled in the aforementioned FBI investigation. The Trojans notched a 12-6 record in conference play and finished second in the conference for their highest finish since 2002, but that won’t do much considering the committee will not put a team’s conference ranking into consideration when selecting tournament teams.
Enfield belabored that point, telling reporters after Saturday’s loss that “sometimes common sense has to prevail.”
That’s a fair argument. But this team cannot make excuses if it ends up on the wrong side of the bubble on Selection Sunday. Despite the scandals, the injuries and whatever else went wrong this season, there were very winnable games that were lost, very simple steps that could have been taken to secure a tournament spot long before Thursday.
Instead, USC’s postseason future is uncertain. And for a team with this much preseason hype, making the tournament is the very least it can do to salvage this year.

“I grew up here,” said Araksya Nordikyan, a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and student at USC. “I don’t know a home besides California. Our parents took a good-willed intention and a risk, and we can’t be blamed for it, because we were so young. It’s really unsettling because if I’m not allowed to call this place my home, and my home is also not where I’m from, then what is home? Where do we belong?”
Nordikyan, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, is one of the dozens of DACA students at USC. She said she doesn’t remember much about coming to the United States. 
She emigrated from Armenia with her parents when she was just 4 years old, and hasn’t been back since.
Nordikyan didn’t know her immigration status until her senior year of high school. When she tried to apply for financial aid to pay for college, she realized she didn’t qualify because she isn’t a citizen of the United States. 
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

DACA is an Obama-era policy that grants work permits and deportation relief for two-year renewal periods  for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors. 
Now, DACA recipients at USC are facing uncertainty about the security of the program — President Donald Trump issued an order on Sept. 5 last year that would have terminated the DACA program on Monday. 
However, federal district courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco filed injunctions against the order, and the Supreme Court declined Trump’s attempt to bypass appeals courts and reverse the injunction decision at the Supreme Court. 
“The uncertainty scares me — I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” Nordikyan said. “What if [Trump] cancels the program completely? What happens next? I have no clue.” 
Provost Michael Quick sent out a memo Monday encouraging students and staff who are DACA recipients to seek legal advice in light of increased uncertainty about the program’s continued existence.
“While the more immediate threats to those in our community with DACA status are at least temporarily removed, we know this also prolongs the fear and ambiguity,” Quick said in his memo.
USC President C. L. Max Nikias said he is worried about the uncertainty that Trump has created regarding DACA’s status.  
He estimates that there are at least 70 to 100 DACA recipients currently attending USC. 
“[It] creates a lot of anxiety for these kids,” Nikias said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It may prevent them from concentrating on their studies.”
Nikias said he identifies with students struggling with immigration issues. 
He came to the United States to pursue his master’s degree and subsequent Ph.D. at the State University of New York Buffalo, and he and his wife, Niki, had to go through a complex naturalization process to become American citizens. 
“We came to the United States a long time ago as international students to pursue the dream, for better lives, for better education,” Nikias said. “I can sympathize with the anxiety and uncertainty of an immigration status, but also I can see the benefits of education, that anyone who gets a USC degree and stays here and pursues a career, they are going to be very productive citizens of our society.”

Yaneiry Barrios, a senior studying contemporary Latino and Latin American studies and social sciences (psychology) immigrated to the United States from Guatemala when she was just a year old. 
“It was very hard because [my mother] migrated by herself with her one-year-old on her back,” Barrios said. 
Barrios said she grew up with a vague understanding that she was undocumented, but didn’t fully understand it until she tried to apply to a study abroad program in France at her high school. At that point, she realized she couldn’t because of her immigration status. 
Barrios said she was one of the first to apply for DACA when President Barack Obama introduced the program in 2012. 
“It felt good,” Barrios said. “I was the first one in my family who was able to get an actual driver’s license, and understanding that I was granted an opportunity to be legal here, even though it wasn’t [citizenship], but have the reassurance that I can stay here.”
But that began to change after Trump was elected to office and began to make changes to U.S. immigration policy. 
“My DACA expires toward the end of September,” Barrios said. “Right now, with the uncertainty of what’s going to happen, I don’t know if I’m going to lose my DACA, or if I’m going to be able to reapply … What scares me is that if they remove DACA completely and get rid of it, what’s going to happen when I graduate?”
THE RIGHT RESOURCES 
Graphic by Karan Nevatia | Daily Trojan
The University has set in place various initiatives to provide resources for DACA students, staff and faculty. Associate Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez-Brake was appointed the central contact person to coordinate support for DACA students across campus, the Gould School of Law is hosting immigration clinics, and counseling services available to DACA students, Nikias said. 
“I have the opportunity as a religious leader and a chaplain to offer confidential counsel, which means anyone who walks through this door is able to feel and trust that I can keep anything they share with me confidential,” Gomez-Brake said. “As you can imagine, for those who are undocumented or even DACAmented, that is something that is very cherished, because that is something you can’t talk about with just anyone.”
In terms of legal resources, the Gould Immigration Clinic’s Legal Advice Project provides assistance to USC community members — including students, staff, faculty and their family members — through legal consultation and advice, and by helping to fill out DACA renewal applications. 
“We’re helping DACAmented students to renew their DACA applications,” Immigration Clinic Director Niels Frenzen said. “We’re giving them individual consultations to determine whether or not they are eligible for anything else — is there something in their personal history that might allow them to pursue legal status that they didn’t know about before?”
Barrios went to the immigration clinic to talk about her application with experts. 
“They told me what I could do, the next steps I should be [taking],” Barrios said. “I took what they told me and talked to my lawyer back home and see what she thought, and got her opinion as well, so I was able to get two sources.” 
The University is also reimbursing students for the $495 renewal fee for DACA, with funds from the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments and the Provost’s Office, according to Frenzen. 
Gomez-Brake said those funds will be disbursed through her and the Office of Religious Life. 
The University has also appointed Assistant Director of Crisis Services Beth Kebschull as the Engemann Student Health Center point of contact for DACA students, and Engemann will provide counseling services for students experiencing anxiety due to uncertainty about DACA, according to the Provost’s memo. 
At the same time, however, some students expressed concerns about the completeness of the University’s commitment to its DACA students and workers.

Improving Dreams, Education, Access and Success, a student organization created to empower undocumented students, held a workshop for DACA recipients on Tuesday. 
At the meeting, attendees discussed whether the University would continue to support them after they graduate, whether the University has a plan in place to support students if DACA is repealed in the near future and whether the University will continue to employ staff members who would no longer be authorized to work if their DACA work permits are invalidated. 
“After graduation, will USC just forget about us or would they still look out for us?” Valeria Resendiz, the co-executive chair of IDEAS, said. “There’s so much uncertainty surrounding DACA, we want to know that the school will keep us here, will support our education.”
Barrios also said that she wants to see the University expand the pop-up DREAMer resource center that IDEAS and the American Studies and Ethnicity department created in 2017. 
The center’s name refers to the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, which would have allowed young undocumented immigrants to become permanent residents had it passed through Congress. 
“The University should make the DREAMer Center something more official, and something that should be running continuously, because there are still students at the University who have not come out as undocumented,” Barrios said. “It should have a space for all undocumented students to study and get to know each other, because we have [Asian Pacific American Student Services], El Centro, Norman Topping, the Lavender Lounge, so if we have spaces for those groups, we should also have spaces for undocumented students.” 
Resendiz said that while the center is still open, it lacks the resources it needs to run efficiently. 
POLITICAL ACTION
Along with the on-campus resources provided, Nikias has been working to lobby the U.S. government to develop a permanent solution with a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. 
“We have an Office of Federal Relations in Washington, and when I go to Washington, and actually go with a delegation of trustees, we meet with members of Congress … [on] both sides of the aisle, where we actively lobby on this issue,” Nikias said. 
Nikias has also made his case to the media — he’s done interviews with CNBC and the Washington Post and published an op-ed in The Hill last month calling for a bipartisan presidential commission on immigration.
“For so long, this has been a political issue without a face,” Gomez-Brake said. “It’s really important for us to remember that these are our fellow students, our fellow humans, they are like anyone else on campus, and they have the same needs.”

In 2013, Jenna Szabo, a senior majoring in human biology, reported that she was sexually assaulted to the Title IX Office and Department of Public Safety at USC. She said the assault was a painful and traumatizing experience, and she struggled to find support on campus. Szabo added that some members of her sorority shamed her for reporting the assault, which only furthered the emotional damage she said she experienced.

“I just felt like I had nowhere to go,” Szabo said. “It was just so hard going on campus every day and just … feeling so alone.”
When she was able to connect with other students who had been victims of sexual assault, she was inspired to form an organization to prevent others from experiencing the traumatic isolation that she had felt after her assault. 
That organization became Trojans Against Sexual Assault, which Szabo co-founded in 2015 with now-alumnae Diana McAndrews and Cassie Collins.
In the past year, TASA has hosted multiple events, called Healing Nights, to allow survivors and students who support survivors to interact in a safe, open space. They also hosted a presentation from USC’s Title IX Office to talk to students about how the Title IX process works on campus and how it explicitly defines sexual assault. TASA has advocated for affirmative consent movements such as #YesMeansYes. 
Tara Ruff, a senior studying journalism and political science, is TASA’s current president. She said the #MeToo movement has helped the club gain traction on campus. 
“With #MeToo you’ve seen women and men alike who have been sexually assaulted taking their power back and standing in solidarity with each other,” Ruff said. “Providing a safe space for people to talk about that at a school is really important.”
Ruff said TASA is not just a club for sexual assault survivors. 
“This is literally Trojans Against Sexual Assault,” Ruff said. “If you believe in that mission, if you believe in that name, you’re so more than welcome to come to us. We’re here to empower each other and it’s welcome to literally anybody who wants to do that.”
Szabo said that along with limited resources for support, reporting cases of sexual assault is an issue across campuses. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, one in five women and one in 16 men will experience sexual assault while in college, but more than 90 percent of sexual assault survivors on college campuses do not report their experiences.
Chandra Ingram, a sophomore studying journalism and international relations and the global economy, is a member of TASA’s executive board. She believes an important function of the organization is educating students about the issue of sexual assault on campus. “A lot of guys get really defensive and feel attacked, [but] men are also sexually assaulted,” she said.
Ingram noted that the student body has to lead the way on issues if there is to be any change in the University. 
“It starts with the student body,” Ingram said. “What the students rally around and care about is what the University is also going to follow.”

Kosher dinners will be made available to Jewish students three nights a week in the USC Village dining hall starting March 20, according to an email sent to a list of students with dietary restrictions for religious reasons. 
From the moment he arrived on campus, Shayan Kohanteb, a freshman studying business administration and an Orthodox Jewish student, noticed a lack of food he could eat in the dining halls. Since then, he’s been working with others to get kosher options in USC dining halls.
Kohanteb, now an Undergraduate Student Government senator-elect, said Varun Soni, the dean of religious life, and Rabbi Dov Wagner from the Chabad Jewish Student Center, have helped him greatly in this process. 
“Dean Soni sat down with me in the very beginning and really heard me out,” Kohanteb said.  “We’ve been really pushing and working with Housing. It has to be said how much help they’ve done.”
Wagner said that prior to the change, he would pick up food from different Kosher restaurants around Los Angeles and deliver it to students three nights a week. Since the beginning of the semester, the Office of Religious Life has been subsidizing these meals, Wagner said. 
He said that there are approximately 75 Orthodox students on campus and another 50 to 100 who eat only kosher meat. About 15 Orthodox students who are on meal plans will be able to take advantage of this new change. 
Wagner said this will be the first time there is fresh kosher food available for students on campus. According to the email sent to students, Beverly Hills Kosher will deliver food to the dining hall every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night. 
Beverly Hills Kosher will also provide sandwiches, salads and other kosher options to the Seeds Marketplace at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The cashier’s desk in the Village dining hall will have a list of students, along with their ID numbers, allowing students to receive their meals, according to the email. Students who wish to be added to the list are instructed to contact Kohentab directly. 
Wagner said that adding Kosher meals to dining halls is a step toward becoming a more inclusive campus. 
“The availability of kosher foods speaks also to how students who observe kosher feel accepted in this university community,” Wagner said. “I think it’s an important value at USC to celebrate diversity and to be welcoming to students of all kinds of backgrounds.”
Kohanteb said he’s grateful for these new options, but will continue to work to have kosher options for students more than three nights a week, and to provide halal options for Muslim students.
“No matter how grateful I am,” Kohanteb said. “I always look toward progressing this way past where it is now to the point where we have a long-term, sustainable program on campus.”
