The final environmental impact report of The Fig Project, a 4.4 acre development on Exposition Park, was presented to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission in a public hearing Wednesday morning. 
Around 100 people — residents, tenant advocates, developers and lawyers — observed or provided testimony for the proposed project, which would demolish eight historic multi-family buildings to make room for a seven-story hotel, 222 units of student housing, 186 units of residential housing and a commercial retail space, according to the report.
Ventus Group, the real estate investment company behind the project, has supported construction of the area since 2014. The final report must be approved by the planning commission in order for construction to begin, and is supported by Councilman Curren Price, the area’s city council representative.
Compared to the draft report Ventus Group submitted in 2017, The Fig’s total floor area decreased 3,480 square feet in the final version.
Eighty two units of The Fig’s living space will be affordable housing, although current residents are unsure they will be able to qualify for it. The residents expressed fear about the potential displacement The Fig Project will bring to their homes on 3900 Flower Drive.
“When a developer comes in with a complete lack of respect of what is the context of a neighborhood, it’s unacceptable,” said Jean Frost, chair of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council. “It is the genocide of a neighborhood.” 
Frost said the council generally supports the development, but not Ventus Group’s proposal, which will remove 32 rent-controlled housing units. 
The buildings targeted by developers for removal were designated historic by the state of California in 2008. Historic preservationist Jim Childs told the Daily Trojan in September that Ventus Group has the option to build around the historic structures, but chose not to in the planning process. 
“When something’s designated as historic, you have the responsibility to build around that,” Childs said about the draft report. “If you want to tear [these buildings] down, you have to go through a process. What [Ventus Group] failed to do was offer reasonable project alternatives to this development, which is a requirement.”
According to Frost and Childs, the neighborhood council had suggested an alternative design plan that would leave the historic residential units as they are, but Ventus Group rejected the proposal in its draft report. 
Howard Sunkin, a USC alumnus and partner of EK, Sunkin & Bai public affairs firm, sat with individuals from Ventus Group, and said he believed The Fig was a good agreement for the families in the impacted area. 
“It’s fair to say [Ventus Group will compensate] three times what the law requires,” Sunkin said. “We have people accepting them as we stand here today, so obviously it must’ve been a very reasonable offer.” 
If evicted, the tenants will be entitled to relocation assistance fees under the Ellis Act, a state provision that allows landlords to remove tenants if the property is leaving the rental market. The fees will vary depending on tenant income levels, duration of stay in the unit, family size and age.
While some residents expressed the possible benefits of The Fig, others remained adamantly opposed to the development.
“Not having our street anymore will destroy our memories we have built there,” said resident Elyse Valenzuela. “The people who are sitting here agreeing to this project, Ventus will be knocking on their doors letting them know their homes will also be demolished.” 
Opponents of the project, like Valenzuela, fear that The Fig will attract developers to surrounding areas which can amplify displacement.
Mirna Romero, a USC alumna and former resident of the development site, said the project can bring increased city tax revenue and improve the neighborhood’s infrastructure. 
“We would be able to provide more housing in general,” Romero said. “If you do a cost-benefit analysis, we’re displacing 23 families, but we’re getting 200 units. All of that revenue is brought into the community — there’s property taxes that are paid.”
Opponents of The Fig’s final environmental report can provide comment to the city about their concerns, but developers are not required to respond to them, according to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning. 
The project’s draft report was available for a 45-day public comment period starting in October 2017.

A group of LGBTQ Latinx student panelists spoke about the differences between racism and colorism, and addressed the oppressive experiences those with intersectional identities face. (Hyeonmi Shin | Daily Trojan)
The USC LGBT Resource Center and El Centro Chicano joined forces Wednesday evening to host a discussion on homophobia in the Latinx community. The event featured five LGBTQ Latinx student panelists who spoke about their personal experiences. 
Around 25 students listened to them discuss topics including deciding when to come out, stereotypes toward Latinos who identify as LGBTQ and the different experiences within the community based on skin color. 
“I think USC has a responsibility to take care of its students and by having these conversations. You’re attempting to improve the well-being of these students who are arguably the most vulnerable,” said Eve Cantu, a senior majoring in business administration who attended the event. 
Following the panel, attendees asked questions and shared their own stories. 
“I grew up in a very Asian majority community, so you never really talked about these things growing up,” said Kristina Chern, a junior majoring in accounting. “It wasn’t really until I got to college that I learned more about the LGBTQ community and panels like these are a really good open space to get a good listen about the topic.” 
The discussion also focused on how much of the homophobia and stigmatization of LGBTQ individuals in their community derives from the cultural concept of “machismo” or the sense of being “manly.”
Panelist Alexia Sambrano, a freshman majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, helped ideate and plan the event.
This semester, all cultural assemblies on campus hosted training sessions for their student staff and encouraged them to think about programs they wanted to execute. 
Sambrano works at El Centro Chicano as a special projects assistant and volunteers at the LGBT Resource Center, where she saw a lack of intersectional resources and realized the need for a program to address this.
“One thing I struggled with in high school was coming to terms with it and actually acknowledging that I’m bisexual and learning how to adjust within my community, culturally and in the environment I was in,” Sambrano said. “Having a conversation about this and just sitting and listening can help you tremendously even if you don’t ask any questions — just learning from the experiences can help mold your identity which is what I really wish I would have had.”
Sambrano created the event  to in shed light on homophobia within the Latinx community and provide students a safe space to discuss the intersection of sexuality and racial identity. She said Latinx communities have a tendency to sweep such topics under the rug.
“Instead of [having] best of both worlds, it’s like being oppressed from both sides,”  Sambrano said. 
In addition to shining a spotlight on intersectionality, the event also intended to educate both LGBTQ students and allies, foster a dialogue and further explore cultural and religious causes of homophobia.
“I’m sure that this event will allow for a lot of things to happen,” said William Vela, director of El Centro Chicano. “But obviously more communication, more dialogue and hopefully more Latinx students who identify as LGBTQ feeling included and other students being more aware of our community’s needs.”

First-year residents halls such as Pardee Tower, typically feature study lounges for residents. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
Some students admitted for Spring 2019 may be housed inside renovated study lounges due to a lack of available freshman housing space, according to USC Housing. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Housing Director Gregory Schaffer said that the high volume of students entering USC has led to a decreased availability in housing for students. 
“Due to [the] unprecedented level of students committing to USC, USC Housing is working to accommodate as many students on campus as possible for the spring semester,” Schaffer said. 
He further addressed in a second statement that lounges will be converted into housing spaces. 
“We are making alterations to some lounges in case they are needed,” Schaffer said.
Most spring admits learned about the changes from spring admit ambassador Ariana Kim through a post in the USCSpringAdmits2019 Facebook group.
“The majority of the lounge spaces will be in freshman buildings and will be completely transformed into dorm rooms,” Kim wrote in the USC Spring Admits group. “These transformed spaces will have beds, desks, dressers, wardrobes, cable and internet and micro fridge/microwave.”
Trinity Anthony, a 2019 spring admit, said that the Facebook post was the only communication she received about her housing situation. 
“We were all kind of thrown off by it because we weren’t informed of it all, and we were trying to figure out how the fall freshmen knew this before we did,” Anthony said. “I took it upon myself to email housing and ask them about it, and [USC Housing] confirmed it.”
Students typically do not learn of their living situation until early December when housing assignments are released, according to the USC Housing site. 
Isabel Washington, one of the spring admits who said she contacted USC, said that some students she has spoken to have “been on edge,” due to the uncertainty.
“If it’s just one person living in a study room that submitted their application yesterday, that’s different than half of the spring admits having to live in a study room,” she said.
Washington also said that some current freshmen are concerned about how this might affect study lounge use. 
Shannon Sinwell, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and a 2017 spring admit, said that not enough information is communicated to spring admits before they arrive on campus. 
“Speaking from my experience, I feel like I had to constantly be reaching out to a spring admit representative and asking them questions,” Sinwell said. “I wish we all could’ve been put on the same email list and just all be given the same amount of information at the same time.”
Sinwell studied abroad during the fall semester before coming to USC, and had to sign a lease at University Gateway Apartments because there weren’t enough on-campus housing options for spring admits. 
Anthony said that being able to live on-campus was a large factor in her decision to attend USC. Now that she may have to move off campus to avoid living in a converted study lounge, she said she may regret her decision.
“I feel like with a lot of stuff, [USC Housing] waits until the last minute to tell us, when instead they can just be upfront, ” Anthony said. “Why did [the University] have to wait until two months after we submitted our housing applications to say something?”

Despite posting a solid 15-2-2 season, the No. 8-ranked women’s soccer team received the No. 4 seed in the NCAA Division I College Cup, stunning head coach Keidane McAlpine. 
“Anytime you see your name you’re happy to be in,” McAlpine said. “It rewards us for the work that we’ve done. Was I a little shocked by being a four? Absolutely, but it is what it is.”
The Trojans will have home field advantage in its opening round as a result of their seed and will host Long Beach State on Friday.
“We’ve got Long Beach — an opponent we know — and that’s our focus right now,” McAlpine said. “You line up. You play the games.” 
USC has not missed a postseason appearance under McAlpine and will be making its fifth-straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament after finishing the regular season with a Pac-12 record of 8-2-1.
After a heartbreaking double overtime loss to UCLA Friday at the StubHub Center, USC dropped to a four-seed. USC entered the tournament selection process ranked No. 6 in the most recent Coaches Poll.  
The Trojans shut out the 49ers earlier this season with a dominant 3-0 win. The Trojans should use the outcome as a motivation — but should still work hard for conference play.  
“I remember that game was our senior night, so it was really emotional. So, I think going in without the emotion might help us a lot too,” said senior forward Leah Pruitt. 
The 49ers won its final match with a 2-0 shutout against UC Santa Barbara to win the Big West Conference title this weekend, with goals from seniors forward Ashley Gonzales and midfielder Dana Fujikuni. With a 12-5-3 season, the Big West Conference win sends them into postseason play with an automatic bid for the first round of the tournament. 
Long Beach State will be making its seventh College Cup appearance, bringing a five-game unbeaten streak into tournament play. The 49ers take on Trojans for the first time ever in the NCAA postseason.
A win against the 49ers would match the Trojans against the winner of LSU-Boston University in the second round. 
USC has an all-time postseason record of 21-12-3, with two NCAA championship titles under its belt. 
The 2016 USC team secured the National Championship with a 3-1 win against West Virginia. Coming off a big season title, the 2017 Trojans went in with a No. 3 seed, but their postseason was cut short in a penalty kick loss to Baylor in the second round.
“We’ve just got to play how we play and come out strong, so we’ve got something to prove,” Pruitt said.
Even in the wake of an unfavorable seed and a predicted heavy travel schedule, the Trojans are hopeful hoping to secure a spot in another national championship. 
“We’re going to go all the way,” Pruitt said. “We’ve just got to take it one game at a time. We might not have been the highest seed we wanted to be, so we are probably going to have to travel which … we’ll do it. We’ll do it anywhere.” 
USC will face Long Beach State  Friday at 1:30 p.m. at McAllister Field.

Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware rushed for a career-high 205 yards and three touchdowns against Oregon State. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With the weather cooling down on campus ahead of homecoming weekend, the Trojan football team took to the field on Wednesday to prepare for Saturday’s game against Cal. 
The Bears sit at second-to-last in the Pac-12 North, but the team has fared well against highly ranked opponents in the last two weeks, squeaking out a 12-10 win over Washington and losing by six to Washington State. 
Head coach Clay Helton said that the team has been playing “high-level football,” making the homecoming game as important of a matchup as any other for the team, which must win out to have a shot at the Pac-12 championship game.
After a decent outing against Oregon State, freshman quarterback JT Daniels will need to be prepared to return to form against Cal. 
The Bears bring a defensive scheme that Helton described as “a nightmare” for quarterbacks, and the freshman is spending all week preparing to adapt to it. 
Fresh off his rest week after suffering a concussion, Daniels threw for 177 yards and one touchdown last week. He didn’t throw a single interception, but his accuracy was barely above 50 percent, a weakness that could be exploited by the disruptive Cal defense. 
Another major concern in the passing game is the continued absence of wide receiver Michael Pittman. The junior leads the team in receiving yards, but has been questionable in practice throughout the week. 
Helton said that he is still uncertain for Saturday. As a result, freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown will start, joining the starting receiver corps of redshirt sophomores Tyler Vaughns and Velus Jones Jr.
The key for the Trojans’ attack, Helton said, will therefore have to rest on a balance between Daniels and the running attack, led by senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware. Helton compared Ware to Justin Davis, a former USC running back now playing with the Rams who was known for his grit and work ethic. 
Helton added that Ware’s strength comes from his commitment to the everyday grind and on a team in desperate need of a culture shock, that level of intensity in weekly practices has been vital for providing energy on Saturdays on the field. 
Last week against Oregon State, he ran for 205 yards and three touchdowns. According to Helton that performance might be repeated against the Cal.
Injury update
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Matt Fink continues to nurse three broken ribs, and redshirt sophomore backup quarterback Holden Thomas is also injured, leaving the team with only one backup at the position. 
Sophomore running back Stephen Carr is still recovering from a high ankle sprain and most likely will not see the field on Saturday, along with Pittman. The team will also lose wide receiver Randal Grimes for the year; the sophomore will redshirt to focus on academics after sitting out since the Arizona State game.
Both lines are continuing to struggle with health issues, with redshirt junior Clayton Bradley out on the offensive side and junior Caleb Tremblay continuing to sit out on the defensive side. Senior cornerback Iman Marshall is also doubtful with several leg injuries following the Oregon State game, but he was present at practice, jogging around the field in sweats and his practice jersey.
However, Wednesday saw the return of linebackers junior Connor Murphy and redshirt junior John Houston, and freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart. Houston and Taylor-Stuart were both heavily taped up after sitting out for weeks with injuries, but their return is promising for the USC defense as it looks to continue to reload in the coming weeks.

It’s not even going to be close. Trust me. I know we’re only one game into the season, but anyone who watched Tuesday night’s game between Duke and Kentucky knows that this is the God-given truth. 
Heck, anyone who didn’t watch only needs to look at the scoreline — a disgustingly dominant 118-84 finish powered by a fleet of freshmen — to know that this Blue Devils team is like 2012 Kentucky incarnate but, like, 100 times scarier.
Look, this is coming from the strongest, dumbest, most belligerently obstinate Kansas Jayhawks homer on the West Coast. My guys don’t even stand a chance. 
Freshman power forward Zion Williamson is going to eat junior center Udoka Azubuike for a snack. Freshman forward R.J. Barrett is going to make redshirt sophomore guard K.J. Lawson look like a middle schooler trying to guard a high school senior. Kansas coach Bill Self might have put together one of the most talented and well-rounded squads that Lawrence, Kansas has seen in a hot minute, but it’s still not going to do anything against the Blue Devils. 
That’s because trying to stop Duke with a well-rounded team of top-tier talent is like trying to fight a forest fire with a garden hose. It’s well-intentioned, sure, but it’s never going to work. That’s because this team is the definition of well-rounded, but in a whole new sense. 
Typically, a team that is considered well-measured and balanced is seen as such because it has an appropriate level of talent at every position. Great college teams need a big man to power down low, a point guard who can handle and dish, a defensive specialist, a random pasty white guy who can drill threes from the corner at opportune moments. Coaches obviously attempt to recruit a wide variety of talent so that they can put a team on the court that has an equal (and hopefully equally high) level of talent at every position. That’s elementary.
But Duke flips that on its head. Instead, this team offers an astonishing breadth of players who offer all of those skills — the shooter, the floor-spreading ball-stealer, the scrappy defense man, the white dude in the corner — wrapped up into individual packages. And they’re impossible to guard.
I mean, have you seen Zion? Yes, I am calling this 18-year-old man child by his first name because he is already that big of a name already, despite being three whole years younger than me. (No, I’m not bitter.) 
This freaky kid is like some kind of Dr. Frankenstein conglomeration of every necessary skill to be a good basketball player. Normally, you only get a few skills, like one of those Facebook “Pick two of these three things” memes. No one gets to be 6-foot-7, weigh in at 285 pounds and sprint the court as fast as the smallest dude on the court. No one gets to have the strength to hammer dunk over a seven-foot post and still have the deftness to maneuver through four men like a guard.
But that’s the reality for Zion, who is easily the greatest show on hardwood this season and will probably stay that way throughout his illustrious future in the NBA. I would be mad or jealous of this kid’s talent if he wasn’t so fun to watch, but here I am, pencilling the Duke basketball schedule into my calendar alongside my Jayhawks’ lineup, because I’ll be damned if I miss out on this star’s rise.
Of course, the frustrating thing about this team is that it’s not just the Zion show. Sure, he scored 28 points in his freshman debut, but he was outpaced by Barrett, who posted 33 points, and Cam Reddish rolled out 22 points as well. 
That’s right. Duke had three freshman forwards drop over 20 points in a game against the No. 2 team in the nation. Supplemented by solid performances from their guards — only three players on the roster, including a walk-on, didn’t post points in the blowout — the towering trio proved what happens when you bring three agile 6-foot-7 monsters onto the court at the same time.
That’s what makes this Duke team just so lethal, and it all happened on purpose. Duke boasts the most lethal freshman class in the nation, and perhaps in NCAA history. It’s the first time the top three recruits of any class went to one school, and unlike other freshman classes, this super team chose itself. 
When Duke cruises to an undefeated national championship win, we’ll all have Duke basketball alum Tyus Jones to thank. The former Duke star turned his little brother Tre onto the team, and as Tre grew up in the game, he began to amass a dazzling group of friends through playing travel ball. Soon, a group chat was formed between a group of kids who played with and against each other in All-American circuits and youth Olympic teams.
Sure, they knew that eventually all five of them would end up on Power 5 NCAA teams and in the NBA. Why not do it together? The group committed as one, and this decision to buy into the same program and vision might be the scariest part of this young Duke squad. 
Sure, we’ve never seen a team with this much talent; but more importantly, we’ve never seen a team of young guys with this much talent who have chosen to pursue the title together. This cohesiveness and unity at such an early point is the final straw that is guaranteed to break opponents’ backs this year.
The Blue Devils have a plan, and there’s really not much stopping them. College basketball fans will just have to strap in and count their blessings this season; because as far as I’m concerned, the national championship is already well on its way to Durham.

On Tuesday, millions of Americans voted on new policies in their states, cities and counties, and though the votes are still being counted, now is a great time to start looking at the results of the midterm election and their possible effects on our everyday lives. 
Unfortunately, unreliable sources of information and a convoluted political system make becoming politically literate difficult.
The world of politics may seem overwhelming and its jargon confusing to the unfamiliar citizen, but at the very least, Americans must be aware of the biases and influences impacting the information they consume. Here are a few tips on how to familiarize yourself with the rhetoric and discourse circulating in the media as well as sources you can use to better understand our political system and the implications of the 2018 midterm election results.
“Google it” might seem like too obvious of an answer, but looking something up on a search engine is a fast and efficient way to find accurate and multi-sided information.However, not all results on Google may be credible, so it is crucial to cross-check your facts.
Always proceed with caution. If your newsfeed seems cluttered with flashing headlines and outrageous claims, you’re probably seeing sensationalist content, as opposed to factual, impartial content.
Left and right-leaning news sources will often omit information that doesn’t support the agendas of the political parties they’re aligned with. If you’re reading an article published by one source, cross-check it with an article that covers the same topic from a different news outlet. A key indicator of bias is emotionally charged rhetoric. 
Reading objective newsletters such as Ballotopedia’s is a quick way to gain systematic knowledge and increase awareness of controversial political practices that are normally subjectively covered in digital media. Ballotpedia’s newsletter provides clear updates on policy and shifts in public office without additional narrative.
Books are also excellent resources for political education because they are objective and contain peer-reviewed information. If you’re looking to learn more about America’s current political system, “What You Should Know About Politics…But Don’t” by Jessamyn Conrad is an essential read. The book is a nonpartisan overview of issues ranging from lobbying to international affairs, but it transcends contemporary climate with its sociological and historical insight, making it a prime educational resource.
“Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do” by Andrew Gelman also provides excellent information about America’s election process. Gelman reveals the entanglement of political polarization with voter interests while offering suggestions for how politicians should better handle citizen interests. Gelman’s work focuses its analyses on the aftermath of the 2000 election, but its examination of political voting patterns is timeless.        
Participating in compassionate, meditative political discussions starts with understanding how our country’s political system functions and is sustained through thoughtful consumption of accurate political information. If each of us learns about and open-mindedly interprets political news, our society will become more unified and democratic.

Seasonal depression or seasonal affective disorder (aptly referred to as SAD) is a common form of depression that usually results from the shift in sunlight that one receives throughout the day during seasonal shifts and daylight saving time changes.
There are varying degrees of the disorder and it can manifest in altering one’s routine or chemical state. If college students find themselves feeling particularly blue during fall and winter, SAD may be to blame. In the rush of finals, internship applications and holiday travel, students may brush off their feelings of depression at this time of year, but they should know that SAD is a real and treatable condition, and there are resources available to help them. 
The signs of seasonal affective disorder are not too different from the usual signs of depression, including feelings of misery, guilt, low self-esteem, helplessness and a loss of interest in activities. 
New anxieties and tensions may crop up. Sleep problems are common, including a desire to oversleep, difficulty staying awake, disturbed or interrupted sleep and general feelings of lethargy and fatigue. Overeating, specifically a craving for starchy, sweet foods, is not uncommon, either. A loss of sex drive or a lack of interest in physical contact may also occur. If left untreated, SAD can sometimes lead to suicidal ideation. 
There are some risk factors that one can take into account when preparing for the winter months and assessing the likelihood that one’s mood is more severe than just “the blues.” Interestingly, gender is a risk factor. SAD is diagnosed at a rate four times higher in women than in men, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Distance from the equator is also a factor; for example, 1 percent of people who live in Florida suffer from SAD, while 9 percent of people in New England suffer from it. 
Family history is also important, as a lineage of depression or mood disorders can increase one’s chances of developing SAD. If someone has already been diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder, SAD may just be a more extreme iteration of a previously diagnosed disorder. Age is also a determinant — SAD is more prevalent in those between the ages of 20 and 30. 
It’s important to know how to treat SAD or even take preventative measures against an oncoming seasonal change. Medication, particularly anti-depressants, can assist with the absorption of serotonin, a protein that regulates feeling of happiness in the brain, and are commonly prescribed by a psychiatrist. 
Talk therapy can also be helpful, as can light therapy, which simulates sunlight with blue light boxes. Consuming vitamin D, in the form of daily vitamins, is beneficial as well. Further, because seasonal depression is recurrent, some people who struggle with SAD prepare for the fall by increasing medication or speaking with a therapist more frequently in advance of a regression. 
SAD is not just depressive disorder, and it’s not only restricted to the winter months. While less common, some people experience seasonal affective disorder in the spring and summer in the form of hyperactivity and manic episodes. 
The end of daylight saving time Sunday may also have left some feeling a little depressed. The decrease in hours of sunlight may affect on people’s physical and mental health. 
Students should be aware of the mood changes they may experience as a result of this time of year, and should not be afraid to seek out some help. Asking a friend to talk or seeking out counseling on campus is a great way to start, and wellness dog Professor Beau is always happy to help. For those looking for a peer to talk to, USC has a branch of Active Minds, a mental health awareness and advocacy group for students. Students looking to find help on campus in a more professional setting can call (213)-740-9355 or make an appointment online, and those in dire need of help should call the Suicide Prevention Hotline at (800)-273-8255 or call 911.
Feeling particularly bad in the fall and winter is nothing to be ashamed of, and there are are plenty of resources to treat seasonal depression.

Cap those travel mugs and cleanse your palettes — the Los Angeles Coffee Fest is coming to town. 
From Friday to Sunday, the Magic Box at The Reef in Downtown opens its space to the first L.A. Coffee Festival. This three-day international event will feature “not only exceptional coffee, but [also] incredible local food, cocktails, live music and art.” In addition, 10 percent of ticket sale proceeds will go toward supporting clean water projects abroad.
The issue with most tradeshows — whether they promote cheese, medical equipment or another industry — is that they are geared toward experts and clients who helm big name corporations. But one of the tenets of a great cafe is the personal experience, the chats between baristas and regulars, the comfort of carefully chosen furniture and interior design. 
I never thought there would be a way to balance the mildly paradoxical concepts of cafes and expos, but hopefully this festival will prove me wrong. As a bottom-level consumer — not a barista, cafe owner or bean distributor. I’m unduly pleased that I’m in Los Angeles for the first West Coast iteration of the event.
In addition to being consumer-oriented, the festival raises money for a good cause — New York City’s coffee festivals have raised $150,000 over the last three years. Project Waterfall partners with nonprofit organization Charity: Water to fund clean water projects in Rwanda.
A ticket to the festival promises cups of coffee from a variety of vendors — coffee cocktails and teas are in the mix as well. Beyond coffee tastings, the festival site will also host “interactive workshops, demonstrations from world-class baristas, delicious street food, intoxicating coffee cocktails, live music, art and so much more.”
Though Kyle Glanville, co-founder of local joint G&B Coffee, tweeted about a lack of local representation when the festival was first announced, a few L.A.-based vendors will make on appearance this weekend. Local cafe Two Guns Espresso, roastery Common Room Roasters and bean curator Los Angeles Coffee Club will supply as much coffee as patrons can drink, repping the best of the West Coast. Internationally inclined curators like Colombian Coffee Club and innovative roasteries like Four Sigmatic Coffee (known for its mushroom infusions) will also be serving up cups of joe.
Abounding with firsts, the festival will debut The Kitchen, a spot to grab grub amid all the beverage stops. The official site doesn’t offer specifics, but teases attendees with promise of “fiery demos, workshops and talks headed up by culinary legends….[and] a collection of up-and-coming restaurateurs and celebrity chefs who are making a mark on the vibrant Los Angeles cooking scene.” In addition, local eateries like Echo Park-based Pollen, Triniti, Bluestone Lane and Lately comprise the Street Food Market. Let’s hope that The Kitchen will have more than brunch fare — the primary offering of these other restaurants — as the festival runs until late evening.
I’m looking forward to the Coffee Music Project singer-songwriter competition, which features local acts and sends the winner off with a free recording session, a cash prize and a performance in the 2019 London Coffee Festival. It takes many cups of creativity to construct a lineup based on the “coffee” theme, but my column seems to manage, so I have high hopes.
Closing out the long list of firsts is the first United States Coffee Mixologist competition — baristas and mixologists (read, bartenders) pair up to concoct the best coffee cocktail. There will be a movie room showing coffee-inspired films, including Stumptown Roasters’ film “Flower of Flowers,” which discusses the effects of climate change on coffee farming. 
Tickets are on sale online, starting at $27 for a standard ticket to one of five three-hour sessions, increasing to $35 the day of. VIP passes, which go for $50, are good for a full day and include merchandise and a free coffee cocktail. Whether you’re a casual cappuccino-sipper or a full-time barista, this festival will offer a variety of experiences and, of course, three days of bottomless cups of coffee.

Apparel might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of environmentalism. Yet, the rise of eco-fashion has slowly become an important part of attaining sustainability. Representatives from three sustainability companies spoke at Taper Hall Tuesday night about their experiences running environmentally conscious companies in a panel hosted by The Sustainability Project, a student group dedicated to advocating for sustainable policies in business.
Panelists included Jennifer Silbert, co-founder of Rewilder, a company that creates bags from purely salvaged materials; Holly Eve Hernandez, founder of the all-natural beauty brand Madame Lemy; and Robert Luo a senior majoring in marketing and co-founder of eco-friendly men’s bags company Mi Terro, Inc.
The founder of the Sustainability Project Randy Yue led the conversation with questions centered on the panelists’ shared passion for environmentalism.
Silbert said she has been interested in reusable materials and sustainability since childhood, but it was her previous career in architecture that furthered her interest in design. The ability to combine these two passions into one vision excited her.
“There is opportunity right now to merge these things together — business and design and sustainability,” Silbert said.
Silbert channeled her platform for change as a founder of an eco-friendly backpack company.
“[I’m excited to] use fashion as a platform for talking about real lifestyle changes,” Silbert said.
Luo cited his goals for the environment as his inspiration for Mi Terro, Inc.
“After more research about the industry we found that there are many green fashion brands for females but not too many for men. So we thought men should step up,” Luo said.
The conversation then turned to how the effects of unsustainable living are catching up to humans.
Before creating Madame Lemy, Hernandez was a makeup artist and did not realize that many makeup products contained numerous hidden chemicals. Hernandez was inspired to start her company after a close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer and believed it was due to the harmful products she used.
“In the [increased use] of these chemicals … we all have somebody who has been diagnosed with cancer or with a hormonal disorder,” Hernandez said. “These chemicals have been parallel of these diseases.”
In further explaining how toxic beauty products can be, Hernandez said that there is little to no regulation in the U.S. for cosmetic products.
“There are 11 chemicals that are banned  in this country. Compared to the European Union, there are about 1,400 chemicals banned,” she said.
To wrap up the conversation, the panelists encouraged the audience to follow their own dreams and create companies that are sustainable. Despite their different company missions, all of the panelists agreed on one major thing: That the time to help save our planet is now.
“Just do it, just dive in and do it and do it right. Now is the time. This whole world needs you to do whatever is in your head,” Silbert said.

On Tuesday night, HBO CEO Richard Plepler spoke to students about his company’s strides toward diversity and appropriately representative shows in the context of the contemporary political climate. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Over the past few years, the competitiveness of the entertainment industry has grown exponentially with the rise of streaming services. However, Richard Plepler, HBO’s Chairman and CEO, said that media’s changing landscapes do not diminish his optimism for the company’s success at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday. 
In the discussion moderated by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay, Plepler started by explaining how HBO’s chooses what content to publish. 
“People always say, ‘What defines a HBO show? What are you looking for? What are you thinking about?’ It’s a pretty simple answer: We’re looking to elevate the brand,” Plepler said. “Every time smart storytellers come in the office and have an idea that we think lifts the brand up into popular culture and into our public discussion, whether that’s a documentary, a miniseries or a show.” 
Plepler also detailed how two HBO shows are adding to the national conversation around politics: “Axios,” which delivers news coverage and insight through interviews and profiles, and “Vice News,” a news documentary series that looks deeper into both domestic and global issues. He said both of these shows provide educational and politically engaging content to younger audiences in particular. 
The number of HBO subscribers amount to a quarter of households in the United States that watch television.  Plepler also claims that the number of views “Vice News” garners in one night equals the the numbers that networks like CNN and Fox get. 
“I think that [the views] show an appetite for smart content and for beginning to organize complexity for the world in a very confusing time,” Plepler said. 
Despite competition from other media conglomerates, Plepler said that HBO is focusing on producing content that audiences want.
“A brand is a promise,” Plepler said. “Every brand is making a promise to their consumer. You better deliver the implicit promise that you are making. Our promise is the curation of excellence and the curation of quality.” 
The success of all programs is backed by the increase in subscribers, according to Plepler. Since the launch of HBO’s streaming platform HBO GO two years ago, the network’s viewers have increased significantly, and the company hopes to continue to grow with new shows airing in 2019.
In light of box office hits like “Black Panther” and “Crazy Rich Asians,” Plepler also discussed the importance of widening the media aperture to represent different groups that better reflect the country. 
“If we’re doing our job right across the canvas, across the gallery, we’re listening for all of those different voices,” Plepler said. “If you do it right, you will have a mosaic and everyone knows it when they see it.”
From Plepler’s perspective, diversity in actors, writers and directors is key to the development of HBO because it provides intelligence, voice and a range of expression. 
Plepler also came to talk at Annenberg April 2017 and collaborated with the school to launch the Diverse Voices Forums last October. The year-long series was created to educate students of the importance of diversity in the entertainment industry, connecting them to professionals from HBO.
Given increased diversity in upcoming HBO shows like “Euphoria,” which focuses on high school students’ struggles with drugs, sex and identity, Plepler sees a bright future for the company as long as it continues to fulfill its mission to create quality content.
