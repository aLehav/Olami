As Tom Hanks famously said in A League of Their Own, “There is no crying in baseball.” But this is not about baseball.
Little of the weekend of March 16 was about baseball for the USC baseball team.  In the early morning of Saturday, March 17, just hours after the team was swept in a doubleheader by Utah, tragedy struck the program. Mike Cruz, brother of head coach Frank, died of colon cancer at the age of 62.
As the head coach of one of the marquee college baseball programs in the country, Frank’s commitments are extensive. During the season, he works seven days a week, be it at the field for a practice or a game, or on the road recruiting players.
Mike was first diagnosed with colon cancer in July 2008, just one week after Frank was fired from his head coaching job at Loyola Marymount University. Mike had emergency surgery, and moved in with Frank not long after. Jobless, Frank had more than enough time to care for Mike. The two lived together for six months, and after surgery and chemotherapy, Mike’s cancer was in remission.
Frank was named the interim head coach at USC in August 2010. One week later, Mike’s cancer came back.
“It’s ironic because it came at a difficult time in my life in being fired, and came in one of the most ecstatic times in my life in being hired [at USC],” Frank said. “It really kept me balanced in terms of what’s important. (Being) hired or being fired is not what’s important. Life is important. Life and support are what’s important.”
Mike again started treatment when his cancer returned, and once it started to affect his daily life, he moved back in with Frank.
That was at the end of the 2011 season, when the season was already long lost for the Trojans. Frank’s commitments were more limited. There would be no postseason; he still had time to devote to Mike. But when this 2012 season started, Frank knew things would be different.
“When the season started, the number one priority was that (Mike) was comfortable,” Frank said. “So I always told him ‘Hey, if you want me to stay here I’ll stay with you.’ But he would always chase me out and tell me to go to practice. He’d say, ‘Go take care of the guys.’ That was his big thing.”
Frank and Mike were also comforted by the Trojans’ performance on the ball field. USC won seven in a row to open the 2012 season, their best start in 24 years. The Trojans dropped three straight, but reeled off five wins in a row. Their 12-3 record earned them a No. 24 national ranking.
But all throughout the Trojans’ success, Mike’s health was worsening. While Frank never missed a game and only a handful of practices, it was clear he had other commitments.
“I wasn’t able to either appreciate [the wins] or reflect much on the losses we had at that time because as soon as the game was over it was really over.” Frank said. “I’d go home to a bigger part of life.”
**********
On Monday, March 12, Frank’s team was 12-3, getting set to start Pac-12 Conference play on Tuesday against UCLA at Dodger Stadium in an annual event known as the Dodgertown Classic. Before Frank left for work that Monday, Mike said he wanted a new USC hat because he planned on attending the game at Dodger Stadium the next day.
“I get home Monday night and I give him the red hat and he’s just as happy as can be,” Frank said. “He was so alert I told someone I was scared because he was doing so well. And then at about 11:30 at night I guess the adrenaline must have worn off, because he took a turn for the worst. And he hardly slept at all that night.”
Mike was simply “too out of it” to make it to Dodger Stadium. As he did with every game he couldn’t make, he watched online, and was disappointed with the Trojans 7-2 loss. On Wednesday, Frank was scheduled to go to a couple of high school games to see potential recruits. He went to one game in the afternoon and planned to go to another that night.
“But then I got a call from home saying [Mike] was having trouble breathing, so I went home,” Frank said. “And it just didn’t get better.”
On Thursday, Frank and his family took Mike to the emergency room “one last time.”
That Friday the Trojans played a doubleheader at home against Utah.  Game one started at 2 p.m., with Frank arriving just in time. Game two wrapped up around 8 p.m. After being swept in a doubleheader, a coach might have any number of things to say to his team. And no doubt Frank did, but he also had other things on his mind.
It is that Friday that Frank regrets most of his handling of the situation with the team. He admits that, for perhaps the first time all season, the team knew how difficult things were at home for Frank, and he believes it affected their play.
“That’s my biggest regret,” Frank said. “Not only that I didn’t stay … with [Mike] that day. I think the team knew what I was feeling, and I wasn’t really and truly into it 100 percent and I don’t think they were. And I really felt responsible for that. I probably would have been better off staying away and allowing them to compete and do what they do.”
The team would never admit that their play was affected by Mike’s condition. But Frank was right about at least one thing: his players knew.
“[Frank] tried to keep it as much away as possible,” freshman pitcher Nigel Nootbaar said. “He did a really good job of staying positive and trying not to let it affect him. But I always tried to keep Mike in my prayers, like during the national anthem and whenever else I could. Because we knew the situation wasn’t good.”
**********
Mike Cruz was given his last rites on that Friday, March 16. His family laid him down at 11 p.m., and he passed away at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday morning. Because they played a doubleheader on Friday, USC did not have a game Saturday.
“That was typical Mike,” Frank said. “He chose a day to pass away that we didn’t play and wasn’t going to affect the schedule.”
With no game on Saturday, the team instead had batting practice. No one would blame Frank for not coming to this particular practice. But he did.
“I came Saturday to get all the mourning and sadness out of the way with the team,” explained Frank.
On Sunday the Trojans again hosted Utah in the series finale, trying to avoid a sweep. There was a touching moment of silence before the game, and Frank threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
“It was difficult Sunday,” Frank said. “But I knew that I had to be focused into the game with the players. And nobody ever said, ‘Win the game for Mike,’ or anything like that. But that was obviously in my heart, and it was definitely a way to help me grieve at that time.”
With heavy hearts, the Trojans responded, jumping out to a 4-0 lead and cruising to a 10-5 win.
“We never talked about it,” said pitching coach Dan Hubbs on playing the game in Mike’s honor. “Frank told the team to just play their game. But I can’t honestly say we weren’t thinking about it. How could we not have been?”
For two consecutive weekends after Mike passed, the Trojans played on the road, first at Stanford in Palo Alto, then at Washington State in Pullman.
“It kind of delayed some of my emotions,” said Frank. “Because when we finally got home for a home series, and you’re at your home for more than a couple of days, it really started to sit in. But you get through it. … And the team was my support.”
**********
And for everything Frank gave to Mike, Frank said he has taken many valuable lessons from his brother’s struggle, plenty of which he shared with his team.
“I’ve always told the team was that this guy’s incredible,” said Frank of Mike. “He doesn’t let his illness affect others. And I tried to tell them, you can’t let your problems affect others as well. Those are the type of lessons I would share with them periodically.”
Now that Mike has passed on, Frank is a little more open with his players. He continues to share the lessons he has gathered in dealing with this great challenge.
“He’s a great faker,” said Frank of his brother. “Even if he’s in pain, he’ll fake like he’s feeling better and make me feel comfortable leaving the house. So he always acted different than he felt. And I try to tell the team that often: act different than you feel. If you struck out, you got to act different, because you’re going to come up again later.”

When Glenn Dicterow, concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic, takes his place at the Thornton School of Music in 2014, his colleagues will not be strangers, but old friends.
“I go back a long way historically with a lot of the faculty,” Dicterow said. “I’ve known [Midori Goto] since she was a little girl. I’ve known Ralph Kirschbaum since we were teenagers. I’ve known Alice Schoenfeld since I was a child because her sister Eleanor was one of my chamber coaches.”
After a two-year search, USC announced Thursday that Dicterow would be the first person to hold the Robert Mann Endowed Chair in Violin and Chamber Music, honoring the founder and first violinist of the Juilliard String Quartet. The move back to Los Angeles will mark the end of what will be a 32-year tenure with the New York Philharmonic.

“I will have had almost 40 years of orchestral playing and I’m ready for the next part of my life,” he said. “When I step down from the [New York Philharmonic], I’m not going into any other orchestra.”
Dicterow is no stranger to teaching, though. Despite a busy schedule of rehearsing and performing with the orchestra, he has regularly taught violin students at Juilliard and master classes at the Manhattan School of Music.
“I just have to fit it in between rehearsals when I have time,” he said.
Though the basics of his teaching will not change, he said he expects his students at USC to be different from his current students because Thornton, unlike Juilliard and MSM, is not a traditional conservatory.
“The conservatories here are different in the way that they function because the academics are not stressed as much,” he said. “I think what Thornton is trying to do is to make more an intellectual product. They encourage study in history, in philosophy and I think that’s great.”
What Dicterow will bring to students’ education is his expertise in performance, which began long before his time with the New York Philharmonic. He and his brother began playing violin when he was 8 years old. But his father, a violinist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was not always supportive of his sons’ potential.
“My father was actually not encouraging to us because, in those days, he realized how hard it was for a musician to make a living and he wanted something a little bit more secure,” Dicterow said. “I think because both my brother and I showed a pretty significant talent in that area, my mother encouraged us and practiced with us.”
Dicterow made his orchestral debut as a soloist with the L.A. Philharmonic at 11 years old, playing Tchaikovsky’s “Violin Concerto in D Major.” He continued learning violin and sometimes attended master classes taught by famed violinist Jascha Heifetz at USC. He also continued performing and decided to attend Juilliard with several more years of solo performance experience in many major orchestras under his belt.
“Performance is a part of what you teach and how you come across in front of an audience and how you play — it’s a package,” he said. “It’s interpreting the music and delivering the message that you teach and how you come across in front of an audience and how you play — it’s a package,” he said. “It’s interpreting the music and delivering the message that you want from within and really finding your own voice.”
Dicterow’s career also includes time as both associate concertmaster and concertmaster of the L.A. Philharmonic, a guest soloist in many orchestras and international tours and several recordings for films including The Untouchables, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Interview with the Vampire.
He will spend the next two years balancing his time between the New York Philharmonic and teaching master classes at USC before returning to Los Angeles to begin teaching full-time in fall 2014.
He will make the move with his wife, Karen Dreyfus, a violinist and teacher at MSM, Juilliard and Mannes College, who will also join the Thornton faculty in 2014.

President Barack Obama leads with comfortable margins among women, Latinos, independents and moderates in his re-election bid against presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, according to a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. Overall, 56 percent of the 1,002 registered Californian voters who were surveyed reported supporting Obama, while 37 percent said they supported Romney.
Despite Obama’s recent announcement that he supports same-sex marriage and Romney’s support for an amendment banning it, the results suggest that same-sex marriage will not be a key issue for voters when they cast their ballot in November.
According to the poll, 75 percent of respondents said that a candidate’s position on same-sex marriage would not be a major issue or would just be one of many factors when voting.
“President Obama’s support for same-sex marriage has attracted a huge amount of public and media attention, but it doesn’t appear that it has changed very many votes,” Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC and director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll, said in a statement.
Schnur said that a candidate’s position on the issue will serve more to motivate a parties’ base than to sway swing voters.
“Strong partisans on both sides of this issue may feel more intensely about Obama than they did previously, but same-sex marriage will be much more of a motivator for the two parties’ ideological bases than a persuader for swing voters,” Schnur said.
The poll also found that 51 percent of Romney supporters see their vote for the former Massachusetts governor as a vote against Obama. Forty-four percent of Romney supporters see their vote as a vote for Romney. These results suggest a lack of enthusiasm for Romney among Republican voters, according to a press release.
56% fools is just about right…

KQED, a radio station that broadcasts statewide, will run a series consisting of documentaries created by USC graduate students from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The radio series, titled “20something,” follows the lives of a diverse group of young Californians, exposing personal triumphs and difficulties they face in their communities.
The seven students working on the project found each other in a public radio documentary class taught by Sandy Tolan, a professor in Annenberg. Tolan had already collaborated with a colleague and producer for KQED’s “The California Report” Victoria Mauleon.
“These young journalists spent many hours over four months profiling young people as their lives unfolded over time,” Tolan said in a press release. “This documentary access made possible intimate portraits that you don’t hear every day.”
One of the students involved in the project, Nicole Banner, who is working toward her master’s degree in broadcast journalism, profiled Brandon Blackshire, a young man from Inglewood. When she interviewed Blackshire, he was grieving the murder of his girlfriend, a kindergarten teacher, and his close friend M Bone. Despite the hardships Blackshire endured, Banner hopes that Blackshire’s story will inspire people in his community and others to be as grateful and optimistic as he is.
“I think my story reveals a lot about some of the bigger social issues in our community,” Banner said. “We are the future, and it is important for people to listen because these issues have a large impact on the world.”
James de Grazia, who is working toward his master’s degree in specialized journalism, profiled Claudia Gomez, a teacher at FREE LA High, a charter school that accepts students who have spent time in a correctional facility. Gomez, 20, who experienced her own personal set of struggles and missteps, started at the front desk but soon took charge of a documentary program looking at the effects of mass incarcerations on youth.
“Claudia was an incredibly open and generous subject,” de Grazia said. “She made a huge effort to teach me about her community and the challenges it faces.”
Listeners who tune into the show will also hear stories of a woman working at a high school for formerly incarcerated youth, a 23-year-old Honduran UCLA student who is gay and seeking political asylum, and a Chinese real-estate entrepreneur.
Banner said she hopes the program will show students the strength of individuals to overcome challenges.
“There are a lot of shocking and sad facts about our society, “Banner said. “But as the series reveals, we have the tools, the heart and the capability to overcome our troubles. I just hope that the sooner people realize that, it will inspire people to stop and make a change for the better. “
In addition to Banner and de Grazia, Annenberg graduate students Raquel Estupinan, Tara Kangarlou, Michele Malkasian, Arezou Rezvani, Megan Sweas and Yasser Zhang will also produce episodes of “20something.”
The series can be heard live online at 4:30 p.m. on Friday at kqed.org/listen.
KQED’s “The California Report” airs on more than 30 public radio stations across the state. In Los Angeles, it airs from 10:30 p.m. to    11 p.m. on Sunday on KPCC 89.3 FM.
In addition to airing every Friday on KQED throughout the summer and occasionally later this year, USC’s Neon Tommy will produce web content that correlates with the aired stories.

The school, which began its orientation sessions Tuesday, is scheduled to open Sept. 4 as part of the Los Angeles Unified School District and aims to graduate 100 percent of its high-need students by increasing access and learning opportunities.
“Hybrid High School will fill a vital need for a rigorous educational program tailored to students’ needs and [it will ensure] that more of our students are finishing high school,” principal Stephanie McClay said in a press release. “I’m excited to begin our work with our students and families.”
The 19,000-square-foot site will be composed of four large learning labs, two project rooms and “huddle rooms” for group interaction, according to the press release. The school plans to enroll 150 students its first year, growing its student body to 650 students over the next four years.
Applications are currently being accepted for the incoming ninth grade class and a lottery will be held if the school receives more than 150 applicants.
David Dwyer, executive director of USC Hybrid High, said he was tasked with creating a new program that can make a major impact in an urban community, as Katzman-Ernst Chair in Educational Entrepreneurship, Technology and Innovation in Rossier.
Studies have shown that one-third of dropouts are the result of needing to work, to help families or to provide care to family members, elders, siblings or children, according to a press releaese. In the LAUSD, 56 percent of ninth graders finish high school in four years. USC Hybrid High serves neighborhoods with an even lower dropout rate, according to the press release.
Families in the USC neighborhood are encouraged to attend an orientation session held at Waite Phillips Hall 403 on June 12, June 26, July 10 or July 24.

USC senior Steve Johnson wrapped up a fitting ending to his prolific collegiate career by capturing his second-consecutive NCAA singles championship Monday.
Johnson, the No. 1 seed in the tournament, clinched the back-to-back by defeating Kentucky’s No. 3 Eric Quigley 6-4, 6-4 in the finals at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex in Athens, Ga.
A strained abdomen and shin splint could not hold Johnson back, especially in the final game of the second set.

He fired off three straight aces before forcing Quigley to error with a deep ball that sent Johnson to his knees, screaming after taking his final point as a Trojan.
With the singles title, the back-to-back singles champion also earned a wild card berth in the U.S. Open in August.
En route to the finals, Johnson relinquished just one set to his six opponents.
Johnson finished his Trojan career by winning an unprecedented 72 singles matches in a row, dating back to January 2011. After going 37-0 in his senior year, Johnson concluded with a 149-21 overall record.
“He’s special; we all know that,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “In a lot of ways he’s changed college tennis. I think he’s going to show that it’s OK to stay four years.”
No. 21 senior Daniel Nguyen, No. 25 sophomore Ray Sarmiento, No. 57 sophomore Emilio Gomez and No. 51 freshman Yannick Hanfmann also participated in the singles tournament after the No. 1 Trojans captured their fourth-consecutive NCAA team title last Tuesday.
Hanfmann, who clinched the team championship for the Trojans with his singles win, fell 3-6, 4-6 in the first round against No. 50 Louis Cant.
The other three Trojans, with the exception of Johnson, were eliminated in the subsequent round.
Gomez and Sarmiento fell in straight sets to No. 9 Blaz Rola and No. 2 Mitchell Frank, respectively, while Nguyen finished his collegiate career with a 4-6, 4-6 loss to No. 5 Henrique Cunha.
Nguyen, who was a part of the team for all of its last four championships, finished 135-38  for his career.
In the 32-team doubles tournament, USC’s only pair, consisting of Johnson and freshman Roberto Quiroz, advanced to the quarterfinals as the No. 2 seed.

After a grueling quarterfinals win over No. 39 Alex Domijan, Johnson could not finish the quarterfinals doubles match later in the day.
[Correction: A previous version of the story incorrectly stated that Steve Johnson Roberto Quiroz were leading when they retired to the Texas Tech pair in doubles.]
“I feel like I let Roberto down a little bit,” Johnson said. “I just physically didn’t have it in me, and I hit an overhead point in that last game that completely ripped my stomach apart.”
Despite coming up short in doubles, Johnson, who had the option of skipping his senior year at USC to begin his professional career, achieved his ultimate goal of winning another team title with USC and became the first NCAA singles champion to also win four team championships.
“I can’t believe it. Four years went by quick, but to say the least it’s been a special four years that I’ll never forget. It’ll definitely go with me for the rest of my life,” Johnson said.
 
A hearty congratulation Steve. Once again, continuing the Trojan tradition of winning with class. Fight on!
Congrats Steve, it’s been a fantastic four years and I wish you
only the best in the years ahead! You are a true Trojan! Fight On!

Los Angeles made history last week when it became the largest city to pass the much-discussed plastic bag ban, catalyzing the transition from a small-scale, grassroots movement to one that’s in the mainstream consciousness.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the L.A. City Council passed the ban with a sweeping 13-1 vote. Even with the hefty majority, the plastic bag ban must first go through a four-month environmental review period to officially be put into effect. The ban calls for large and small markets to phase out plastic bags during a six-month to one-year period. Paper bags will cost 10 cents each one year after the ban becomes active.
Christina Ellis | Summer Trojan
Opponents argue that the ban leads to job losses — a critical issue in this recovering economy — and serves as an inconvenience to shoppers and retailers alike.  Opposition aside, however, there’s little denying that plastics are harmful to the environment, in large part because they do not biodegrade.
“Plastics are very long-lived products that could potentially have service over decades, and yet our main use of these lightweight, inexpensive materials are as single-use items that will go to the garbage dump within a year, where they’ll persist for centuries,” Richard Thompson, lead editor of the “Plastics, the Environment and Human Health” report, said according to Environmental Health News.
The plastic bag ban looks like a step in the right direction, as it encourages conservation and attempts to minimize harmful plastic pollution. But that’s where the problem lies — people are at fault for the ubiquity of plastic waste, not plastic bags themselves. Plastic bags have been made out to be the villains, when pollution is really the direct result of the human hand.
That’s not to say that people maliciously seek to litter our beaches or endanger wildlife by tossing plastic bags. It’s simply a matter of human carelessness, whether it occurs on a personal or industrial level.  But this is the worst part about the ban — it has been created and put into law out of a need to engender environmental consciousness when this awareness should already be inherent.
Considering that plastic pollution affects businesses and customers alike, the plastic bag ban doesn’t serve a quick fix to pollution.  Instead, societal attitudes toward the environment need to change, whether that means diligently recycling plastics at home or putting mechanisms into place at waste management companies. People need to motivate themselves to recycle and preserve; eco-friendly legislation shouldn’t have to tell them to do so.
We don’t need a Heal the Bay campaign or a dramatic commercial with Sarah McLachlan to inform us of the downsides of plastics and pollution. Keeping that in mind, awareness isn’t the crux of the issue here; it’s that people passively allow pollution without giving it a second thought. We have to ditch the passivity and use plastic bags responsibly, in the process keeping unnecessary waste out of our landfills.
Human carelessness is the issue here, not plastic bags, and the ban wouldn’t exist if people and companies treated plastic with the caution it deserves. But with such a fragile environment in our hands, we can no longer turn a blind eye.
C. Molly Smith is a junior majoring in communication and online editor for the Summer Trojan.  
It’s the people that need to be educated about the environment. It’s not that people don’t care and throw bags away, it’s that people do not know. Measures like this will help “educate” people about the dangers of the bags. Measures like these need to be taken for people to wake up!
You’d think the online editor for the DT would know that her major is “communication,” not “communications” with an “s.”
No -hit Matt!

The hot months of summer can mean beaches, warm weather and the sight of many tourists in cargo shorts and Hawaiian T-shirts.
But when the sun fades into a beautiful dusk, a swarm of people will flood into their local movie theater in search of fun — and sometimes mindless — entertainment.
This year’s summer blockbuster season is sure to be huge; here’s a list of the most anticipated flicks of the summer, popcorn not included.
 
Prometheus, June 8
 
Ridley Scott has kept the details of the sci-fi largely under wraps, save for a buzzed-about trailer — which shows stark similarities to Scott’s 1979 Alien — and some viral marketing, including a commercial for the fictitious Weyland Corporation featuring Michael Fassbender as a remarkably human android.
One of the screenwriters is Damon Lindelof, co-creator and executive producer of Lost, so nothing is off the table.
The bare bones is that the spaceship Prometheus embarks on a journey to discover the meanings of markings created by ancient civilizations, led by archaeologist Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and Prometheus captain Janek (Idris Elba) under the watchful eye of Weyland Corporation suit Meredith (Charlize Theron).
Fassbender supposedly modeled parts of his android performance on Blade Runner as well as David Bowie, so that in itself is worth the watch, besides deciphering what the movie’s actually about.
Combined with the phenomenal acting talents of Theron, Rapace and Elba and an edge-of-your-seat pace courtesy of Scott, Prometheus might be one of those rare blockbusters with a plot of gold.
 
Rock of Ages. June 15
 
Decidedly different fare than Prometheus, Adam Shankman’s (Hairspray director, So You Think You Can Dance judge) next feature would at first appear to be another throwaway song or dance flick as with the remake of Footloose or Step Up Anything.
But because Rock of Ages is based on the Broadway musical of the same name and features popular ’80s rock hits as well as Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Julianne Hough and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the film seems guaranteed to fulfill lighthearted thrills. Few actors could believably play a charismatic-but-aging rock star quite like Tom Cruise, and he has charisma in spades.
When the synopsis of the Broadway musical includes “After being forced to give him a lapdance, Sherrie beats him up while dancing — with a medley of ‘I Hate Myself For Loving You’ and ‘Heat Of The Moment’” you know you’ll at least be highly amused.
 
TEd, June 29
 
Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis play an idyllic couple in love.
Boring movie, right? Well, what if Mark Wahlberg also has a teddy bear that comes to life? What if the teddy bear is cursing, horny, crude and voiced by Seth MacFarlane?
MacFarlane also writes and directs, so if Family Guy humor is not for you, skip this one. Otherwise, the buddy-comedy repartee between MacFarlane and Wahlberg looks to be fun. Even the CGI teddy bear looks well done.
This film could surprise you.  Expect a raunchy, silly bromantic-comedy in the ballpark of Get Him To The Greek.
 
Design by Christina Ellis
The Amazing Spider-Man, July 3
 
Andrew Garfield stars in the franchise reboot. If recent superhero films are any indicator, this will be a decidedly darker version of the superhero (read: no emo-haired Peter Parker).
Gravitating toward Parker’s backstory, The Amazing Spider-Man delves into the disappearance of Parker’s parents when he was a child. He heads to Oscorp to learn more from his father’s former partner, and must also face off against The Lizard. Emma Stone plays love interest Gwen Stacy.
There might be some elements of the narrative that are familiar to audiences — Spider-Man 3 was released only in 2007 — but they work to the film’s advantage, enabling the story to go quickly past exposition and into more unfamiliar territory.
Expect a darker, more brooding and complex Spider-Man.
 
The Dark Knight Rises, July 20
 
First, if you have no intention of watching this, you are alone.
For the rest of the world, Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne/Batman while Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman return as Alfred, Lucius Fox and Commissioner Gordon, respectively. New characters include the villain Bane, played by Tom Hardy, and Selina Kyle/ Catwoman, played by Anne Hathaway.
Liam Neeson reprises his Batman Begins role as Ra’s Al Ghul, though the extent of his return is unclear.
Hathaway has received criticism ever since pictures of her catsuit were revealed. Based on Nolan’s previous female casting choices — Katie Holmes as a tough-as-nails lawyer, for example — it wouldn’t be surprising to see a mildly dissatisfying Catwoman amid a slew of other dynamic characters.
And though Hardy will likely not match Heath Ledger’s legendary performance as The Joker, Bane is likely to be one of the most formidable and memorable villains yet. Nolan has a knack for creating monumental villains and considering that this is said to be Bale’s last time playing Batman, the legend surely must end with a bang.

Wes Anderson’s eclectic Moonrise Kingdom screens like a storybook fable, as if those elementary Magic Tree House or Hardy Boys novels about the longing for the great American adventure came to life. His focused vision and intelligent dialogue give heart to beaming personalities and render a perfect tale of summer whimsy.
When sending love letters no longer tends the flame of a youthful crush, two young children find themselves forced to take their secret romance into the New England woods.

The 1965 summer, thronged with boy scouts, stolen library books and unbridled adventure, ends up offering a small town more than a vacation — a complete overhaul inside and out.
Much like Wes Anderson’s other works — The Royal Tenenbaums and The Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom — is precise, calculated and purposeful, yet wholly honest.
A well-oiled Rube Goldberg machine, twist after character after plotline propel the story in a genuinely pleasant and focused way.
The film’s story is spirited and invigorating. Moonrise Kingdom wields all the magic and improbability of a fairy tale without the mystical creatures themselves — though Bob Balaban as the narrator looks the part of a perfect back country Maine forest gnome.
A true testament to the power of story telling in any medium,  the young-at-heart Anderson finds his niche exploring variations on the execution of American folklore.
Stylized cinematography breathes life into Anderson’s curious imagination. Vibrant colors and high contrasts paint a utopian summer vision. Methodical pans and close-ups guide the viewers’ attention.
Cleanly executed dolly shots painlessly transition the focus of the characters. Every shot is crisp, every decisive movement and facial expression captured. There is method to the moonrise. Anderson’s acute focus and creative direction flawlessly translate the storybook-like tale to the big screen.
But what is a story without its characters? Taken at face value, films highlighting young actors tend to be either hit or  miss. Effortlessly, the children in Moonrise Kingdom display maturity and talent beyond their years. Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) mold a complex and adult relationship for being so young.

Hayward, especially adept at portraying the aloof and angsty preteen, channels a character so grown up and believable that one easily forgets how young she is.
Though Suzy’s mother Laura Bishop (Frances McDormand) and Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) have their quirks and moments, Suzy’s father Walt Bishop (Bill Murray) and Scoutmaster Ward (Edward Norton) tend to their farcical personalities with comic expertise. Murray, aged before any one knew it, manages the distant father character to become an audience favorite for comic relief.
Norton, doing his best to hold a group of scouts together, is naive but loveable — a kid in more rights than the children in the film.
But yes, the children: A youthful band of inglorious basterds! Suzy’s sharp quips and the scouts’ intelligent banter unravel charmingly sadistic humor and memorable characters.
The characters Lazy Eye, Roosevelt and Izod are all so different and well-crafted, each serving a particular purpose in the story and mood. More than mere cogs in Anderson’s pristine machination, it’s the children that deliver the standout performances.
Perhaps the most charming of all the elements of Anderson’s nostalgic tale of youthful romance, however, is the stunning music. The euphoric orchestration is a simple spectacle. Flute and piccolos, violins and bass, the back country twang of the melodies — Alexandre Desplat (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) produces a pointedly stylistic and romantically mystical soundtrack to accompany the fantastical adventure.
The variations of “The Heroic Weather-Conditions of the Universe” weave together a musical anthology that stands on its own.
Among the brilliant use of Benjamin Britten and timely country ditties, the symphonic movements parallel the plot twists and character developments. Truly, the magic would be much less potent had the score been less innovative and imaginative.
From the beginning of the film, everything works. The cinematography, the music, the characters and the story help Moonrise Kingdom exude childish romance and New England charm.
As much of a cinematic story book, the film is also a cinematic symphony — the ebb and flow of harps, violins and organs parlaying a story of their own.
Besides being a marvel to watch, Moonrise Kingdom’s unbounded heart conjures wistful feelings of elementary affection — something euphorically charming and universally appealing.
This is why we go to the movies — not to journey vicariously through the characters on screen, but to feel something real for ourselves.

Routine always seems to creep and take over the daily activities of life, especially eating. What to do when strapped for time and cash amid hectic work schedules? The answer often involves going to the “safe” food joints — the reliable places you’ve ordered from time and time again.
It’s time to break the habit and explore for once. The relaxed weekends of summer encourage such discovery, and ethnic cuisines of all sorts offer an easy place to begin.
Take Korean food, for instance: It’s more than just all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue, regardless of how awesome that can be.

There’s a vast number of good, affordable Korean restaurants in Los Angeles, but it’s hard to argue against the selection and value of a solid food court.
The Koreatown Plaza, which sits just north of Olympic Boulevard and Western Avenue, offers just that.
The food court can get crowded during peak lunch hours on the weekend, but finding a table isn’t too difficult.  An impressive variety of dining options await new visitors, with joints offering everything from cold buckwheat noodles to Korean blood sausage.
Tonkatsu House’s namesake dish, tonkatsu, is a particularly noteworthy choice: A fat slab of tender panko-fried pork, smothered in a tangy-savory brown sauce, comes with sides of rice, shredded cabbage salad, all-important kimchi (spicy pickled vegetables) and more.
Though more of a fusion dish than traditional Korean, tonkatsu is undeniably tasty and comes in a gigantic portion.
Pao Jao’s not completely Korean, either: The dumpling shop has Chinese roots but still spins a subtly Korean take on the foodstuff. The meat-filled dumplings stand as a revelation — break open the fluffy white bun and smell the steam wafting off a mixture of tender meat and fragrant chives.
For classic Korean cuisine, check out Gamja Bawi.  The gamja-tang, otherwise known as potato-and-pork-neck stew, exemplifies the bold complexity of Korean soups, a cornerstone of the cuisine.
Redolent of sesame leaves, chili paste and pork broth, the spicy stew goes great with steamed white rice and also happens to be the perfect hangover cure.
Vietnamese food can be a bit of a mystery to some as well, but the Southeast Asian fare often impresses with its freshness and culinary sophistication.  Vietnamese cuisine always emphasizes a balance of savory, herbal, acidic and sweet flavors, leading to food that’s complex and satisfying without being heavy.
Downtown’s Blossom, on Spring Street between ourth and fifth Streets, flaunts just that: Fresh, balanced Vietnamese classics.
There’s Saigon-style pho, the ubiquitous noodle soup with a choice of meats and do-it-yourself garnishes. Bun (pronounced “boon”), the popular cold noodle dish, is also a favorite — try the intimidatingly named “bun tom, cha gio, bo nuong,” which comes with grilled shrimp, crisp egg rolls and a chunk of smoky grilled lemongrass steak.
Conveniently, the menu makes it easy to order: All items are numbered, meaning you don’t have to awkwardly stumble through a dish’s name.
Of course, there’s Hanoi-style pho to be had as well, and it doesn’t get much better than the stuff Hoan Kiem hawks. The store, tucked away in the shadows of a dusty Chinatown shopping plaza, sports an impressively minimal menu: Rice crepes, chicken rice and chicken pho, with a beef pho special on certain weekends.
You can’t fault them for the lack of variety, however, because each of these items shine.  The chicken pho, with a richly savory broth and melting shreds of chicken among a tangle of perfectly chewy rice noodles, is a knockout — add some ginger and chili sauce and it’s a masterpiece.
Even old favorites like Mexican food have something new to offer. Check out the late-night favorite El Taurino, for instance.  Sitting proudly right off of Olympic Boulevard and Hoover Street, the colorful eatery dishes out more than just tacos, though those always delight as well.
Try the costillas rancheras, slabs of thin-cut shortrib griddled with onions and served with warm tortillas, braised beans and a fiery guacamole; a splash of El Taurino’s addictive salsa roja takes it over the top.
And come back on the weekend for a hunk of barbacoa — slow-roasted goat — and a bowl of consomé, a deeply flavored soup made from barbacoa drippings that arrives with carrots, chickpeas and a chunk of roasted bone hiding buttery marrow.
Just make sure to pay attention to the order number being called over the P.A.: The yelps of Spanish and English can buzz incoherently at times, though that’s just part of the fun.
There’s nothing wrong with spending another dinner chowing on the University Village’s selection of restaurants, per se, but a little distance from campus brings a (sometimes literal) buffet of fascinating food. Korean, Vietnamese and Mexican are only a few examples of the diverse ethnic cuisines out there — besides, haven’t you had enough Subway and Soy?

After a continued surge that saw it reach second place, the USC women’s golf team fell agonizingly short of victory, falling by a single stroke at the 2012 NCAA Women’s Golf Championships in Franklin, Tenn.

The tournament, hosted by Vanderbilt, saw Alabama prevail with a final score of 19-over-par 1171 after four rounds. The No. 3 Women of Troy fell a stroke short for the second time in the last four years, coming in at 20-over-par 1172. A late charge propelled LSU to third place at 21-over-par 1173, while Virginia took fourth place at 23-over-par 1175.
The Women of Troy were led up front by freshman Doris Chen, who finished tied for 14th at 5-over-par 293. Seniors Lisa McCloskey and Inah Park finished tied for 21st at 6-over-par 294. Sophomore Sophia Popov concluded the tournament tied for 38th at 9-over-par 297, while sophomore Rachel Morris tied for 77th at 16-over-par 304.
After hitting seventh place at the midpoint of the tournament, the Women of Troy skyrocketed to second at the conclusion of three rounds.
Chen moved into seventh place at par 216, notching two birdies in the final three holes to finish even on the back nine. Park tied for 17th at 4-over-par 220 and shot 3-under-par during the last ten holes of the third round to overcome a slow start.
Fellow senior McCloskey stood tied for 27th at 6-over-par 222 while recording three birdies. Popov tied for 40th after three at 8-over-par 224, but aptly finished the round with consecutive birdies. Morris, after leading the team through the first round, regressed to 82nd at 14-over-par 230, notching a birdy on her final hole.
The strong play through the second and third rounds was not lost on two-time former coach of the year Andrea Gaston, who’s in her 16th season with the club.
“It was so tough out there today,” Gaston said. “The greens were so fast. The balls were rolling as if they were on tabletops. You have to be patient and I think we were.”
Gaston was pleased with the play her team as a whole.
“Inah Park was very clutch today and Doris played great. All the girls really fought the conditions well,” Gaston said. “We knew if we could start the backside and get it over with reasonably well, we would have a chance to rally on the front.”
It was only fitting that the tournament came down to the last shot. After Park sank a birdie to cut the lead to one stroke, Alabama’s Brooke Pancake needed to hit two putts to notch the victory, with three putts boosting the Women of Troy to a playoff.
Alas, Pancake sealed the deal on the second putt after a narrow miss, powering the Tide to the championship.
Though the outcome is certainly not what the team wanted, the season proved to be more than respectable, as inconsistency and a fall injury to Popov limited the Women of Troy’s ability to compete as effectively as they did during their stellar 2010-2011 campaign. The team will move forward and has its sights for next season, beginning play in February.

For a team that started the year 7-0, 12-3 and 19-10, USC baseball went 4-22 in its last 26 games, including a dismal 1-15 stretch to end the season.
After getting swept by No. 5 UCLA last weekend in Westwood, the Trojans finished with a 23-32 record, going just 8-22 in Pac-12 Conference play. That record comes out to winning percentages of just .418 overall and .267 in conference play.
The .418 winning percentage is the program’s worst in 27 years, when the team went 24-44 (.333 winning percentage) in 1985. It is the fourth worst in the program’s history, behind 1985, 1982 (22-36, .390) and the team’s inaugural season in the Pacific Coast Conference in 1927 (7-14, .333).
No solution · Senior catcher Kevin Roundtree (left) and senior pitcher Andrew Triggs (right) were unable to lead the Trojans back on track. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
The 23 wins are the least by a USC team since that 1985 team won just 22. The 1982 team also won 23, but before that you have to go all the way back to 1957 to find a USC baseball team with so few wins. That team went 18-4.
The 32 losses are tied for fourth-worst in program history. The Trojans lost 44 games in 1985; 36 in 1982; 33 in 2006; and 32 in 2004, 2010 and 2012.
The .267 conference winning percentage is the program’s third-lowest. The worst was that catastrophic 1985 season, when the Trojans went just 5-25 (.167). In 2010 the Trojans went just 7-20 (.259) in conference.
Likewise, the eight conference wins are tied for the program’s third-lowest number since the Trojans went 3-5 in PCC play in 1945.
Finally, the 22 conference losses are the second-most in program history, after 1985.
The 2012 season completes what is unquestionably the worst 10-year span in the history of USC baseball. In the last 10 years, the Trojans have won 277 games and lost 295.
Of the 1,354 losses the USC baseball program has suffered in its 123-year history, nearly a quarter have come in the last 10 years. And that can’t be blamed on longer schedules; the Trojans have played in at least 40 games a season every year since 1960.
Just one time since 2002 have the Trojans had a winning season: in 2005 when it went 41-22 and made it to within one win of a trip to the College World Series. It is the only time in the last 10 years the Trojans have made it to the postseason. In the 10 years before that, the Trojans made it 10 times.
When the Trojans were 19-10, there was talk of ending that skid. Instead, the season took a turn for the worse.
