When it comes to making a classic album, there are plenty of more important factors to consider than its cover artwork; but still, there’s a good reason why album art is the audience’s first impression of a project. Not only does it make the scale of the creation more tangible for our visual minds, but when handled well, the perfect imaging can enhance our experience with the music as well as our overall appreciation of it. 
One of the best things about the artwork is that there’s no singular way to design a solid cover, even for two albums with similar sonics. Songs from A$AP Mob’s Cozy Tapes, Vol. 1 and Migos’ Culture II flow together seamlessly with their booming trap beats and infectious energy, yet their respective artworks couldn’t be more different: a beaming, infantile A$AP Yams swaddled in a fluffy blanket as opposed to three grown men sporting gold chains and jet-black suits. Still, both covers encapsulate the overarching themes of the actual albums, as A$AP pays tribute to their fallen founding member, and Migos express their influence over the current hip-hop landscape in all their glory.

Personally, many of my favorite covers have been just as varied — although with each of them, I’m able to tie the image to a specific moment within the album that’s ingrained into my memory. With Childish Gambino’s awe-inspiring “Awaken, My Love!”, that moment occurred before I’d even seen the cover art, instead taking place when he premiered the album at the Pharos concert in Joshua Tree a few months before the official release.
My first time seeing Gambino perform live, the psychedelic experience that transpired was nothing like the high-energy hip-hop show I’d long expected from him, but easily became one of my favorite live shows regardless. While Gambino performed an early rendition of “Baby Boy,” I was simply transfixed by the visuals projected above and around the audience, briefly snapping back to reality each time he punctuated the end of a segment with a loud, passionate cry. Each time I look at the album cover, I’m brought back to that exact moment when the song swelled for the final time, and its creator fell back from the microphone with one last shout that struck a deep, resonating chord.
When it comes to Jhené Aiko’s ethereal Souled Out album cover, that pivotal moment came long after I’d heard the music for the first time, but instead when I brought one of the songs to life for myself in high school. The sunshine that beams from the heavens onto Jhené’s elevated figure is the perfect visual equivalent to the song “Eternal Sunshine” from the album, which a close friend and I decided to perform at a Coffee House hosted by our school’s arts program. It doesn’t take a dedicated audiophile to figure out that the original version was better — more so my fault on the piano than my friend’s singing ability, as I stumbled on a few chords near the end — but still, thinking about our live rendition always puts a smile on my face, the memory transposed with the feeling given off by Souled Out’s beautiful artwork.
It’s often a bad sign when the album’s cover is more impressive than the music, but when they’re complementary, it only makes the end product that much more captivating. So this week, kudos to Jessie Reyez and Daniel Caesar for not only forming a divine combination on their first collaboration, but for packaging it behind a snapshot that perfectly sums up the song’s light, airy essence.

Why I’m Smiling: Jessie Reyez ft. Daniel Caesar: “Figures, a Reprise”
How much did I know about Jessie Reyez before this song? I didn’t realize “Figures, a Reprise” was actually a reprise of her biggest hit until my fifth listen. Probably a little late to the party, but I’ll be paying much more attention to the Canadian singer going forward after hearing her piercing vocals for the first time next to Caesar’s honeylike crooning. If you haven’t seen the video of the two of them premiering the song at the 2018 Juno Awards held annually in Vancouver, it’s definitely worth your time; even the audience was surprised when Caesar snuck out of the choir to debut his verse.

Why I’m Hopeful For the Future: Kali Uchis – Isolation (April 6)
In terms of songs that only grow more infectious with each listen, Kali Uchis’ “After the Storm” is easily the strongest choice since GoldLink gifted the culture with “Crew” in 2016. Now, three years after initially turning heads with her EP “Por Vida” in 2015, Kali’s true debut album is finally scheduled to be released this Friday, with production credits from KAYTRANADA and several other high-caliber names. Widely pegged as one of the brightest breakout candidates of 2018, expect Kali’s name recognition to skyrocket once the project finally arrives.

Abel Tesfaye has come a long way in his career since his first project as The Weeknd in 2011. From underground R&B kingpin to pop phenomenon, Tesfaye has found critical and commercial success at every turn.
Photo courtesy of XO and Republic Records.
Now, his newest EP “My Dear Melancholy,” observes Tesfaye reaching back into his old musical wheelhouse. For fans of The Weeknd, this project may feel like a refreshing return to the Trilogy-era sound that kick-started his career. “My Dear Melancholy,” forgoes much of the power pop sensibilities and catchiness of Starboy and Beauty Behind the Madness for the dark, atmospheric R&B that his most loyal listeners know so well.
Although the project is labeled as an EP, “My Dear Melancholy,” has the track-to-track cohesiveness of a full-length project. However, clocking in at a cool six songs and 21 minutes, expectations of a major-label album are nonexistent. 
The Weeknd’s fans may appreciate his harkening back to his downtempo, moody roots, but other than the enlistment of superstar electronic producers Gesaffelstein, Skrillex and Daft Punk’s Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, The Weeknd displays minimal artistic growth for an artist whose career and resources have risen exponentially since his 2011 project House of Balloons.
Unfortunately, some of the EP’s most memorable tracks recycle many elements and song structures from The Weeknd’s more popular past singles. “Call Out My Name,” the EP’s opener and catchiest song, samples his Oscar-nominated track, “Earned It.” While “Call Out My Name” delivers a sexy, captivating hook and the same distorted, ominous synthesizers that permeated Beauty Behind the Madness, there is not much to distinguish it from its superior Fifty Shades of Grey sister track.
This same empty familiarity is reflected on the follow-up track, “Try Me,” where Tesfaye opts for an almost identical cadence and delivery to that of “Starboy.” Here, Tesfaye’s signature lead vocals take a backseat to the momentous instrumental, which does work to his advantage as an atmospheric track.
 The EP’s most glaring weakness lies in the depth, or lack thereof, in terms of its lyrical content. Drugs, sex and depression are themes synonymous with Tesfaye’s music, but he falls victim to many of his own lyrical cliches far too often.
“Privilege” and especially “Hurt You” start off as intriguing thematic pivots with Tesfaye appearing empathetic to his object of desire, but the tracks ultimately return to his signature, self-absorbed lyrical cliches.
On “Privilege,” he croons the hackneyed lyrics, “Imma drink the pain away, I’ll be back to my old ways/And I got two red pills to take the blues away.” Elsewhere on “Hurt You,” Tesfaye delivers a memorably cringe-worthy quote: “Girl, I’ll come to put myself between your legs/Not between your heart.”
In terms of its legacy in The Weeknd’s extensive discography, “My Dear Melancholy,” was never meant to be scrutinized on equal footing as his previous full-length releases. Quite possibly, Tesfaye recorded enough songs for a project but did not want the pressure of a typical album cycle. Therefore, as a finished product, “My Dear Melancholy,” is a high-gloss, low-depth pander to his built-in fandom.
It is not the perpetual rain cloud over Tesfaye’s head that exhausts the listener, but rather his lack in further introspection from project to project. “My Dear Melancholy,” is undoubtedly a project for the fans, but it lacks the fire and songwriting prowess to stimulate a larger and more diverse audience.

For Christian Santana, Friday’s inaugural USC Pridefest was more than just another festival held in the McCarthy Quad.

“I’m pretty open about my sexuality, but it took a long time to get here,” said Santana, a senior majoring in psychology who attended the event. “And as someone who was once in that position where you may not feel 100 percent comfortable, even just walking by something like this, it’s empowering.”
USC Pridefest brought color and vibrance to McCarthy Quad, supplying students with free crêpes from Crêpes Bonaparte, ice cream sandwiches from a Coolhaus food truck and a wide array of activities of expression. A large rainbow flag was spread across the grass, and attendees sported miniature flags on their hats and backpacks.
Hal Pan, the assistant director of the USC Queer and Ally Student Assembly, helped organize this USG and QuASA co-sponsored event.
“It’s a very common practice in queer communities to have a Pridefest, but those usually happen in the summer when people are away from school and perhaps back in communities where they’re not as out and they can’t have as many friends to celebrate with,” said Pan, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation. “So we wanted to provide them with an opportunity to just celebrate identity and have that Pridefest experience here on campus.”
Pridefest also featured bounce houses and over a dozen tables of arts and crafts activities, including button-making, portrait-drawing, temporary tattoos and wax creations by USC Lambda LGBT Alumni Association. The festival also set up information booths from LGBTQ student groups on campus, such as the LGBT Resource Center, Queer People of Color and First-Year Advocacy Board.
“We’re very much in the feminist community and the LGBTQA community,” said Sara Noe, who was running a booth for the online clothing store Kidd Bell. “We’re all about equality.” 
Kidd Bell sells shirts, pins, hats and condoms with strong messages of feminism and equality. 
Another addition to Pridefest was an appearance by Jeffrey Liang, a health educator at Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team. At the event, Liang helped facilitate free HIV testing for students. According to Liang, QuASA reached out to APAIT to bring their van onto campus, where testing occured. 
“A lot of people don’t really have access to HIV testing, so the more we can do to provide access to that, to educate, to work on eradicating the stigma that is around HIV testing and really promote that no matter what your status is, your status is sexy and taking care of yourself is the most sexy thing you can do,” Liang said.
To Pan, an event like USC Pridefest serves as a celebration of identities not only on campus, but also throughout the Los Angeles community.
“Pridefest [is] a moment of visibility, and it’s important … to savor the good moments and see how far we’ve come, and also perhaps mingle, find new people and see the queer community on campus come out and be strong,” Pan said.

USC’s Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment held its “Take Back the Night” opening ceremony Sunday for its two-week long Sexual Assault Awareness series.

In light of sexual assault awareness month this year, SAGE coordinated with several student organizations for their annual series, which features “spaces for sexual assault survivors to be heard,” according to its event page on Facebook. Throughout the week, SAGE will be hosting several activities and programs, including a GLOW exercise class with Body Positive SC this Wednesday and a writing workshop led by author Olivia Gatwood.
One of the student volunteers, Alec Vandenberg, contributed to SAGE’s “Take Back the Night” opening ceremony on Sunday by hanging T-shirts with messages from student sexual assault and sexual violence survivors. 
“I think what’s really important is that there’s a physical manifestation of our commitment to protect survivors and it’s kind of bringing this physical demonstration to increase collective awareness and action,” said Vandenberg, a sophomore majoring in public policy.
Every year, t-shirts are hung from clotheslines to kick off the week. Former President Barack Obama and his administration helped build the conversation on sexual assault incidents on campuses with their “It’s On Us” campaign. “Take Back the Night” is one of these efforts to keep up those conversations.
“As a signature event for SAGE, this is something that has been very central to our mission in raising awareness surrounding sexual assault and sexual violence and power-based violence and cultivating a safe space for survivors,” said SAGE co-executive director Anya Kushwaha, a sophomore majoring in global health and non-governmental organizations and social change. “Especially on a college campus, I think that this is a super crucial series that we support.”
The t-shirts will line the perimeter of the park until Thursday night, when there will be a candle vigil ceremony honoring victims and survivors of sexual assault and violence.
According to Erika Mollinedo-Piñon, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies and narrative studies, in the past, “Take Back the Night” was a week-long series of events specifically focused on sexual assault survivors. However, this year, SAGE expanded the week to an overarching Sexual Assault Awareness Series. 
“[For this event], we’re working with member organizations, like with the Women of Cinematic Arts and Artemis and [other] organizations on campus to expand that process,” Mollinedo-Piñon said. 
According to Kushwaha, the Clothesline Project in particular is a visual display dedicated to raising awareness about sexual violence and takes place at many different campuses across the country. It is symbolic of survivors “airing out their dirty laundry,” Kushwaha said.
“We opened up the space to anyone who was willing and able to contribute and share their stories or their thoughts,” she said. “A lot of them are very personal quotes from [survivors’] assailants or some of them were more general experiences or thoughts regarding sexual violence. They’re super powerful, and one of my favorite parts of Take Back the Night.”

After beating the Washington Huskies in game one of the weekend’s series, the Trojans lost the next two games to bring their record to 13-11 on the year.
Sophomore Lars Nootbaar’s struggles at the plate continued this weekend against Washington. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
The Trojans took game one thanks to a clutch home run by redshirt junior third baseman Angelo Armenta in the bottom of the eighth inning to seal the game by a score of 1-0. 
The Trojans, however, were not as fortunate in game two, losing 5-2. The Trojans were off to an early lead in the first inning when junior first baseman Dillon Paulson hit a 2-run double.
However, the Huskies were able to tie the score in the second inning and get 2 runs on the board courtesy of RBIs from freshman outfielder Braiden Ward and freshman second baseman Noah Hsue.
The game was tied 2-2 until the top of the fifth inning when Washington senior shortstop Levi Jordan hit a double down the leftfield line off of junior pitcher Solomon Bates to to take the game to 3-2. The game was then killed off in the seventh inning after senior designated hitter Joe Wainhouse hit a 2-run single to put the game out of reach 5-2.
After their early lead, the Trojans had a hard time getting the bats going. They only managed to get four more hits the rest of the game.
“We jumped early and I thought for his first start Solomon pitched fine,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after game two. “You know they answered back and did a nice job.”
Sophomore outfielder Matthew Acosta and junior outfielder Lars Nootbaar played in new positions during game two. Acosta, who usually plays in center field, played in right Friday night. And Nootbaar, who usually plays in left field, played in center.
“The switch is more determined on the other outfielder,” Hubbs said. “We decided to put Dubb in the outfield today and get [John Thomas] in the lineup. And he’s better suited for left field and Matthew can play either equally well, and Lars can play left and center equally well, so it was more predicated on that third outfielder than anything else.”
Game three ended like game two as the Trojans lost 9-5 on Saturday despite an early lead in the first. Paulson once again got the scoring started for the Trojans as he hit a 3-run homer into right field scoring in junior second baseman Brandon Perez and Nootbaar.
However, as they did in game two, the Huskies responded by putting up runs in the second inning. The Huskies scored four runs in the second inning to take the score to 4-3. The Trojans then scored one more run in the fifth inning courtesy of an RBI from Nootbaar to tie the game at 4 runs a piece. 
In the sixth, the Trojans retook the lead thanks to an RBI from Perez putting the Trojans up 5-4 with three innings left to play.
The Trojans have relied heavily on their bullpen all season as it is one of the best parts of their team, but the bullpen gave up 5 runs in the seventh and eighth, ending the game in a loss.
The Trojans also uncharacteristically made seven errors in their series against the Huskies this weekend. Prior to the series, the Trojans led the nation in fielding percentage and defending, only making 10 errors the whole year. Earlier in the season, Hubbs mentioned how this team is built around its defense and its bullpen.
While Bushor has been playing exceptionally well at shortstop this season, Hubbs seemed excited about the comeback of freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez who returned for game three with a walk and a strikeout.
“Well, it would be hard for us to want to move Chase off of shortstop,” Hubbs said of fitting Ramirez and Bushor into the team. “It doesn’t mean that Ben won’t be in the lineup somewhere. Or it means that Chase can play third and move over, or he can play second. I mean there’s a lot of things that we can do, or Ben can play DH. I mean there’s a ton of ways to get him into the lineup.”
The Trojans will hope to return to winning ways Tuesday when they play UC Santa Barbara.

On a rare cloudy day in Malibu, the No. 4 ranked Women of Troy (17-7) shone in their first two matchups but failed in their most important test of the day. 
The pair of junior Abril Bustamante (left) and freshman Tina Graudina won all three of their matches on Saturday. Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan
In their first match of the Pepperdine Invitational at Zuma Beach, USC swept Saint Mary’s College (11-5) 5-0. 
To kick off what would be a dominant performance for the Trojans, seniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer outlasted Lindsey Calvin and Kelsey Knudsen in two sets, 21-12, 21-12 on court 4. The Trojans’ next point was earned when senior Terese Cannon and freshman Sammy Slater downed Emily Bible and Lindsey Knudsen, 21-12, 21-16 on court 2. USC was able to swiftly clinch the dual from court 5 with a 21-16, 21-12 win by junior Katrina Kernochan and senior Alexandra Poletto. The victory marked USC’s fifth in a row. 
Although the match was already decided at that point, the top court and court 3 featured two nail-baiting three-set games. USC’s most consistent pair of junior Abril Bustamante and freshman Tina Graudina defeated Morgan Hughes and Payton Rund, 21-11, 17-21, 15-8. 
Sophomore Joy Dennis and freshman Haley Hallgren opened up strong with a first set win 21-9 over Saint Mary’s Sarah Chase and Mary Hernandez on court 3, but the match was forced to go into a third set when Chase and Hernandez won the second set 21-17. Dennis and Hallgren would have to battle back from a 3 point deficit in the third set, ultimately coming out on top 16-14 and completing the sweep for USC. 
USC similarly dominated again in their second matchup of the day; this time against the 16th ranked Loyola Marymount Lions (12-8). The Trojans were able to secure their sixth-straight win at that point behind the the first court pair of Bustamante and Graudina setting the tone by taking down the Lions’ top pair of McKayla Ferris and Savannah Slattery (21-17 , 21-13). 
The second domino to fall was the court 2 pair of Cannon and Slater defeating Sarah Kovac and Jessie Prichard (21-13, 21-11). USC was able to clinch the win when Katrina Kernochan and Alexandra Poletto claimed a 21-13, 21-19 win over Bozena Culo and Maddie Leiphardt at court four.
With their victories on Saturday, USC remains undefeated all-time against Loyola Marymount and Saint Mary’s. 
 In the marquee matchup of the day, the Women of Troy once again came up short against No.1 ranked Pepperdine Waves, falling to their arch-rivals 4-1. 
Though USC fought hard in all of the games and many of the games went down to the wire, they managed to squeeze only one point against the Waves, who have now won 16 out of their last 18 matches. 
The Trojans’ lone bright spot in the matchup came from the top court when reigning Pac-12 pair of the week Bustamante and Graudina earned their 16th overall win on a 21-16, 20-22, 17-15 victory over Deahna Kraft and Corinne Quiggle of Pepperdine. 
With the loss, USC falls to 0-3 against Pepperdine this season and the Waves now lead the all-time series 11-10. They are the only team in collegiate beach volleyball to have a winning record over the Women of Troy. The two teams will face one another again on April 10 at Merle Norman Stadium in Los Angeles. 
 Up next for USC, the team travels to Westwood on Wednesday to take on crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA. 
The two Southern California powerhouses have split the season series thus far, with the Bruins defeating USC 3-2 at Merle Norman Stadium on Feb. 28 and the Women of Troy returning the favor at the Zuma Invitational 3-2 on March 3. 
Wednesday’s  pivotal matchup will be televised on the Pac-12 Network at 3:30 p.m.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Growing up as an athlete and video game aficionado, I always saw myself as a hybrid. I was never the stereotypical “jock” meat-head ­— rather, a significant portion of my young life was consumed by computer gaming. 
I was fascinated by competitive games, both shooters and sports games alike. The pure joy of earning a new rank or winning a match rivaled the feeling I experienced when I won a game on the ice or diamond. From a young age, I felt like an anomaly. There were gamers who loved playing video games and there were athletes who treated sports as the only aspect of their lives that mattered. 
That phenomenon has been challenged in recent years. The first instance I can remember is former Detroit Tigers pitcher Joel Zumaya essentially ending his big league career due to an injury from excessively playing Guitar Hero. As an 8-year-old Guitar Hero enthusiast, I was fascinated by how one of my baseball heroes played the same video game I was obsessed with. 
That was just the beginning of the revolution, though. Since then, the sports world has witnessed some of the biggest professional athletes challenge each other in games such as NBA 2K and FIFA. Honestly, this didn’t come as a huge shock to me. These athletes are just playing virtual versions of the sports they have dedicated their lives to. 
But what really caught me by surprise was the rampant popularity of Fortnite. The game has taken both the professional sports and video game worlds by storm. Fortnite is estimated to have over 45 million players (over 3.4 million concurrent) and even has its own online section on Bleacher Report. If you are somehow still unfamiliar with the game, let me explain. Fortnite is a competitive battle royale-style survival game in which 100 players compete to be the last man standing. 
The barrier to entry is much lower than other titles. Fortnite is a free-to-play game with an easy-to-learn concept but an insanely high skill ceiling. This is seldom seen with games that are released today. Traditionally, games made in 2018 are either too easy to perfect or too difficult that it scares away the less skilled. Fortnite has found the perfect balance between these two areas. This phenomenon allows for the less skilled gamers to have fun and play the game while not hindering the more skilled gamers from perfecting their craft in new ways.
What separates Fortnite from other popular titles is not only its celebrity attention but its celebrity participation and community. Athletes from various sports have alluded to their membership to the community by celebrating with the taunt dances from Fortnite in their professional games. On Opening Day, Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts slapped a double in the 7th inning and celebrated at second base with the “Take the L” dance from the game.
Perhaps the most notable Fortnite event took place when former Trojan wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster played and live-streamed a squad match with Drake, Travis Scott and Fortnite legend, “Ninja.” Smith-Schuster noted that the match was the craziest thing he has ever done and is “better than scoring a touchdown.”
Los Angeles Lakers guard Josh Hart said he experienced a similar feeling when he embarked on a 10-hour Fortnite marathon before earning his first victory. 
“It’s tough, because we won the national championship in dramatic fashion,” Hart said to CBS Sports. “But the first time I won Fortnite, I was screaming, I jumped up out my chair, I was hype.”
One could look at this as just a bunch of athletes messing around playing a computer game for fun. In my opinion, this practice is so much deeper. It speaks to the legitimacy of competitive video games.
Although, Fortnite Battle Royale is not the ideal format for esports, its popularity indicates a significant step forward for esports. The game’s celebrity patrons compare playing Fortnite to the emotions they experience in their professional sports. This further proves that esports can be and are competitive games that evoke the same emotions and require the same level of dedication as their traditional counterparts do. 
With big name spokespersons promoting esports, their fans will be more likely to believe that esports are a legitimate form of sport and entertainment. It excites me to see more and more professional athletes enter the world of esports and I think we are very close to a time where esports will become as popular as traditional sports.

Alec Vandenberg | Daily Trojan
Last week, Aramark-subcontracted janitors at USC and their supporters marched from Trousdale Parkway to USC Village, imploring students to join their campus rally to advocate for higher wages, better benefits and more affordable health care. But even as they walked through the middle of campus past hundreds of students, they were generally met with indifference. 
I’ve dedicated a decent chunk of my column to waxing lyrical about the subpar state of engagement on campus. But these past few months have presented my peers and me with new opportunities for activism, and raised more questions and concerns about our inaction.
Millennials may be painted as the most self-centered generation, but college itself revolves around the student. The pressures of academic course loads, extracurriculars, career development, job hunting and often the struggle to afford tuition, books and basic needs leave little time and energy for social and political activism.
And yet, too rarely do we consider the obligations that we students owe to one another, and to our communities both on and off campus. Circling back to the custodial protest, ought we join USC workers, those who form the bedrock of our campus community and Trojan Family, in their struggle for basic rights and dignity? But more broadly, how should students engage with issues that ought to be solved by our administration, but often stem from our existence on this campus and fall on our shoulders?
The continuing conversation surrounding gentrification represents an extension of this same conversation. USC housing pushed out local retailers and raised concerns about higher rent, and students living in housing around the campus raise the cost of living for community members sharing the surrounding, increasingly pricy housing developments. 
Grace Cillo | Daily Trojan
Zumper, a housing rental website, revealed in 2015 average rent increased by over 15 percent in the area surrounding USC, and Rentcafe lists 90007, USC’s regional zip code, as the second-most expensive zip code for rentals in Los Angeles County for 2015. Just last semester, property owners evicted more than 70 community members in an apartment complex off of Exposition Boulevard to open up their housing stock to wealthier student tenants.
It’s no surprise then when these community members and campus workers — whose lives are inextricably tied to and impacted by campus life — appeal to students when stymied by the administration. They reach out to students through flyering on Trousdale and reaching out to groups and clubs. Or, especially in the case of local evictions unrelated to USC policy, community members encourage students to join local causes to advocate for policy changes.
We students can’t change the unintended effects of our presence, but we can and must change our apathy and translate it into dialogue and action — otherwise we risk complicity by mere association of attending USC.
The service worker rally provided students informational materials and easy ways of contacting the administration to advocate on their behalf. And local housing rights groups and neighborhood associations always look for student support in their conversations and workshops on tenant rights.
But the dialogue and engagement extends further to issues beyond workers’ rights and rent, as students can investigate our endowment to ensure that USC divests from any sin stocks, such as tobacco or arms companies, and we can encourage the transition to campus clean energy to reduce our carbon footprint. All of these examples illustrate how the financial decisions of our University send shockwaves, for better or worse, past the boundaries of our campus and the local community — and there are many ways for students to have impact.
As students, we often feel overwhelmed by the pressures and gravity of inequality and other pressing issues, but also feel disempowered to be the change in addressing special interests, donor clout or other barriers. 
But external factors and internal hesitations cannot justify our inaction. Students taking action to rename the Von KleinSmid Center, a building named after a former USC president heavily involved with the eugenics movement; advocacy groups demanding safer working conditions for campus workers; and environmental groups pushing USC to adhere to their sustainability plans, show the commitment and power of our student body.
Let’s join these activists, our community and all members of the Trojan Family in this overarching push for greater progress and accountability. Because just as our collective action impacts lives, so, too, does our inaction.

This Saturday marked International Transgender Day of Visibility, a day dedicated to celebrating trans people and acknowledging continued discrimination and struggles within the trans community. 
In the country at large, trans people continue to face hatred and violence, demonstrated by a number of jarring statistics. The average life expectancy of a trans woman in the United States is between 30 and 35 years stemming from limited access to key resources.  Homicide rates against trans women have been steadily on the rise, and one in five trans people have been homeless in their lifetime — an issue exacerbated by the Housing and Urban Development Department’s recent decision to exclude trans women and gender queer people from women’s homeless shelters. LGBTQ youth comprise an estimated 40 percent of the United States’ more than 1.6 million homeless youth. The past year has seen President Donald Trump’s administration try to ban trans people from serving in the military, shrug off discrimination experienced by trans students and give health care providers a pass on denying services to trans people on the grounds of “religious freedom.” And since 2015, a new wave of religious freedom policies in North Carolina have sparked a movement across conservative states to require trans people to use the bathrooms corresponding with the sex they were assigned at birth. 
These phenomena hold staggering implications for the safety of trans young trans people. In other words, it’s time for many to come together as a generation and determine what it means to be allies. So many of our peers are not only being denied opportunity, but also being shut out of society, as they are pushed into homelessness and as their rights to basic public facilities like restrooms are consistently made a source of contention and conflict. As young people, they lack the resources, independence and decision-making power of adults, and their lives and living standards are largely shaped by systemic challenges to the most basic rights.
Homelessness and exclusion from public facilities and resources affect trans youths’ health and safety. In addition to being unable to access housing, often as a result of being pushed out by intolerant family, trans youth can be denied by religious charities, and by gender-segregated homeless shelters, which too often turn young trans women away for the same reasons they are often turned away from the appropriate restroom. They are misrepresented as perpetrators of sexual violence who will supposedly target cisgender women, and this misrepresentation stems from the understanding that trans women are not “real” women. They are perceived by intolerant politicians as merely young men in disguise who would endure all of the social repercussions of identifying as trans solely to prey on cis women and girls. 
This popular piece of oppressive, anti-LGBTQ folklore could easily be debunked by anyone who cared to do a bit of research. They would find that trans people are statistically more likely to be victims of sexual harassment and assault in public facilities than perpetrators, with virtually zero documented examples of them responsible for any sexual misconduct in public places. In 2016, one study showed almost 60 percent of trans Americans have avoided public restrooms fearing confrontation, and claim they have been harassed and assaulted in these facilities, themselves.
In 2016, former President Barack Obama’s administration tackled the issue of discriminatory bathroom policy on school campuses head-on, as his Education Department issued guidelines requiring public schools to allow trans and non-binary students to safely use the restrooms they felt comfortable using. The guidelines swiftly drew more than a dozen lawsuits, but they remained intact throughout the remaining duration of his presidency. Less than a year later, the Trump administration’s Education Department repealed these guidelines, and earlier this year issued a new policy. As a part of this new policy, the department will no longer consider campus bathroom discrimination cases, roughly falling in line with the Justice Department’s agenda of no longer acknowledging trans people as a protected class in discrimination cases.
At USC, the University officially announced early in 2015 that it would begin to offer gender-neutral housing options. Gender-neutral restrooms are now available in nearly every campus building. 
And yet, young people who want to be allies to their trans peers must recognize that in many ways, this isa generational issue. The fight for rights and respect for trans people is one that we must take into our own hands, and that means listening to trans people’s voices and advocating for them in spaces where they can’t advocate for themselves. Sometimes, USC’s administration will be with us, and sometimes, against us, but we need to hold them accountable just as we need to hold our off-campus representatives accountable for policy decisions affecting trans people. But in order to be allies, with or without institutional support, we must continue to fight, either way.
