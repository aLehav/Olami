The men’s volleyball team has officially signed six more players to the Fall 2017 roster. The new additions bring the team’s total incoming players to 10, which will deepen next year’s bench in the wake of several seniors’ graduations.
The previous four players that signed in November all hail from California. They include middle blockers Sam Lewis and Mitch Haly, who stand at 6-foot-10 and 6-foot-7, respectively, along with 5-foot-10 libero Cole Paxson and 6-foot-6 outside hitter Noah Franklin. These players will bring height, with Lewis being an inch taller than the tallest player on last season’s roster, and their diversity of positions with help fill the team after graduating five seniors.
At the end of the 2017 season, the team had doubled last year’s win total and made it back to the Pac-12 Tournament in head coach Jeff Nygaard’s second season. However, the team will lose its three graduating starters. With this new set of players, USC looks to keep its momentum after a season filled with ups and downs.
Of the new six signed, four are outside hitters, one is a setter and one is a middle blocker.
The outside hitters include, 6-foot-7 Clay Dickinson, 6-foot-6 Kyle Gear, 6-foot-4 Christopher McBee and 6-foot-4 Pete Obradovich, while the setter is 6-foot-2 Chris Hall and the middle blocker is 6-foot-7 Billy Fauntleroy. Each one will be bringing extensive experience to the team next year.
Dickinson will bring his experience from three Junior Olympics appearances, where he came away with two golds and a bronze. Gear will be coming in after two years making the 2016 Rochester Democrat & Chronicle All-Greater Rochester first team and All-Monroe County League in his home state of New York, increasing his average kills from 13 to 18 per match. McBee will be coming in with international experience under his belt after being on the USA Volleyball Boys Youth National Team, which won a silver medal in Cuba at the 2016 NORCECA U19 Continental Championships. He is expected to be a young leader for the team after finding his footing on a national and international stage early in his career.
Finally, Obradovich will bring his experience from both the court and sand along with his family’s USC legacy, as his father was part of USC’s first NCAA Championship volleyball team and their Rose Bowl Championship team in 1977. His family tradition is part of what brings him back to USC, and the team hopes he will follow in his father’s shoes. Whoever takes the starting spot left by senior Lucas Yoder will have big shoes to fill, but it looks like they are ready for it.
Both Fauntleroy and Hall are coming in with extensive volleyball knowledge. Fauntleroy comes from a volleyball family — one sister who played for Colgate, and one is playing for Virginia and his twin sister who will play at George Washington, gaining knowledge from both playing and being around volleyball his whole life.
Hall was the starting setter on the same team as McBee and has a background in beach volleyball, giving him international and beach experience that adds to his court game. That experience will continue to help the Trojans fill in their bench as they look forward to the fall season.
Overall, the incoming players already have extensive experience before they will step foot onto the court in Galen Center. Their experience along with that of the rest of the team from the 2017 season might just continue with the forward momentum that they left off with at the end of the season and help them push towards to goal of being champions. The Trojans stumbled midseason this year, but pulled out a berth to the MPSF tourney. Next season, their sights will be set even higher with such experience.
All well and good . Out of the ten recruits how many were listed on the Fab 50 rankings?  Tell me when Coach Nygaard gets a top ten player who can be a leader and turn the program around like a Murphy Troy or a Tony Ciarelli. Men volleyball gets only
four or five scholarships total so who were the ones that recd. a full or partial since some already used up on returning players?

The No. 7 USC men’s tennis will compete in the annual Pac-12 championships on Thursday. The Trojans, fresh off a loss to crosstown rival UCLA, secured the No. 3 seed for the tournament with their 5-2 conference record. They will compete in a quarterfinal match against Utah or No. 48 Washington to kick off play.
UCLA won the matchup against USC in the regular season finale and secured the top seeding. Based off their conference record, Cal secured the No. 2 spot. Both teams will automatically compete in semifinal matchups in separate brackets. Should USC walk away with a win against Utah or Washington, it will then face Cal. The winner will go to the championship matchup on Saturday.
In 2016, the Trojans secured the No. 2 seed, only to lose to Cal by a score of 4-1. UCLA beat Cal by that same score to win the title. The Trojans have had luck in previous Pac-12 Championships, taking home the title in 2012 and 2015. In 2012 the Trojans also won the NCAA Division I Tennis Championship, with Steve Johnson taking the men’s singles championship as well.
Heading into this year’s tournament, the Trojans have two players ranked in singles competition as well as two doubles pairs. Freshman Brandon Holt stands at the top of the list with his individual No. 23 ranking. Sophomore Logan Smith follows Holt at No. 82. In doubles, freshman duo of Holt and Riley Smith stand at No. 11, while senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven come in at No. 80 to round things out.
Seeking their sixth national championship in eight years, the Trojans will begin their journey once again this week.

The general disproval rating of the President has reached a historical low with Donald Trump. However, many Trump voters remain staunchly in support of him and express hope and confidence in his future leadership.
According to a poll conducted from April 12 to 26 by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Center for Economic and Social Research, in conjunction with the Los Angeles Times, President Donald Trump’s core supporters remain stable and optimistic about his direction in the coming months, despite low ratings in America.
The Center for Economic and Social Research surveyed 3,039 adult Americans, 2,584 of whom reported that they voted in the 2016 election. The survey results were weighted to match demographic characteristics such as race and gender as well as population distribution by location in order to ensure a balance between urban and rural residents.
The results showed low approval ratings overall: 40 percent approve, 46 percent disapprove and 14 percent declined to choose.
From his voters, however, Trump has gained support. In a survey conducted in March among the same respondents, 33 percent said they neither approved nor disapproved. In the recent survey, however, a majority of the group responded with approval, helping to buoy Trump’s positive rating to 68 percent and boosting his overall rating by 10 percentage points.
The public’s sense of whether or not the country is on the right track was dependent on their candidate of choice last November. About 87 percent of Clinton voters said the country was on the wrong track, and 87 percent of Trump supporters said it is headed in the right direction. Nearly 75 percent of third-party voters said that it is on the wrong track.
Trump voters were particularly optimistic about job creation (79 percent), and somewhat optimistic that the threat of terrorism would diminish (53 percent) and that the country’s healthcare situation would improve (50 percent). Very few Clinton voters agreed, and only a few thought that situations would improve or stay the same in the coming year.
Around half of respondents gave Trump credit for keeping his promises (53 percent), creating change (52 percent) and representing American values (49 percent). Just over four in 10 people surveyed acknowledged him for giving people like them a voice, inspiring confidence (44 percent) and basing policy on facts (42 percent). Just four in 10 credited him for being ethical and trustworthy. A large majority of Clinton voters also said that the above claims do not tend to apply to Trump.
When respondents were asked how they would vote now, few expressed any regrets: 91.4 percent of Trump voters would back him again, while 89.2 percent of Clinton voters would back her again. About 2.5 percent on each side would not vote at all.
The poll also surveyed voters on topics such as the direction of the country, financial situation in the next 12 months, Trump’s job approval, Trump’s accomplishments, feelings about Trump and his policies and what news sources to trust.
Scientists at the Center for Economic and Social Research who conducted the poll discussed the results Wednesday at the President Trump’s First 100 Days Conference, held at USC’s Town and Gown by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.

As a Latino, low-income student growing up in Los Angeles County, George Sanchez merely dreamed of attending college, but in 1977, he embarked on his first airplane ride to Boston — to attend Harvard University.
As a first-generation student, Sanchez struggled to carve a path toward and through college. Now a professor of history and American studies and ethnicity at USC, Sanchez uses his own experiences as a college student of color to aid students at the University who go through struggles similar to his own.
Sanchez’ parents possessed a grade-school education when they immigrated to the United States from Mexico, which Sanchez said was difficult because he lacked the support he needed to create a clear path toward higher education.
“Like a lot of first generation students, I didn’t know what to expect,” Sanchez said. “You were really worried about running out of money, [of] being a burden to your own family.”
Thirteen percent of USC freshman are first-generation students, many of whom face the same challenges Sanchez faced more than 30 years ago at Harvard. Today, Sanchez closely works with the scholars from the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, who are typically low-income and first-generation.
As a mentor for these students, Sanchez worked with the current director of the fund, Christina Yokohama, to build a study abroad program targeted toward first-generation students.
“[We] were looking at the same reports, and the reports were that first-generation college students tended to not study abroad in comparison to other students at USC,” Sanchez said. “It tended to be an issue of not feeling comfortable and not knowing why.”
Being able to visit a foreign country with other Topping scholars provided a pipeline for many of them to study abroad: an education that was previously unavailable for marginalized students who often lacked the knowledge and initiative to travel.
For Felipe Hernandez, a junior majoring in civil engineering, being able to visit Japan with Sanchez made him view his own career pathway in a different light. As for his direct relationship with Sanchez, Hernandez said that he has been a mentor that “always let his voice be heard.”
“Sometimes he doesn’t have to say much to guide you,” Hernandez said.
Because of his one-on-one work with underrepresented students, Sanchez has been able to create connections with other students in ways that professors often do not.
Along with fomenting a direct relationship with the Topping Scholars, and even writing about the history of the fund, Sanchez also worked with students and other faculty members to create a virtual pantry program to aid students who suffer from food insecurity.
As the vice dean of diversity and strategic initiatives, Sanchez formalized his role to help underprivileged students who struggled to bring food to the table.
“It was literally making decisions to buy a book instead of a sandwich,” Sanchez said.
With a donation from a former professor, Sanchez was able to make the work official and has now helped feed many students through the Virtual Food Pantry.
Sanchez is currently writing a book about the history of the Boyle Heights neighborhood. He continues to open doors for those who are often underrepresented on college campuses and create opportunities that previously were nonexistent at the University.
Last semester, Sanchez kickstarted a new major — the Contemporary Latino and Latin American studies, which now has 22 students enrolled.
“Students that were coming from Central America, from Guatemala and El Salvador, and undocumented students that came in contact with me really wanted to study both Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America,” Sanchez said. “There has been a lot of enthusiasm about that. We’ve had to fight for the major.”
With courses offered throughout different departments, students are able to learn about different aspects of Latinos and Latin America,  through an American studies or a political science class.
For Ana Barrios, an undocumented junior majoring in contemporary Latino and Latin American studies, working with Sanchez on direct research on Guatemala, the country she was born in, sparked her interest in joining the major.
“I’ll be able to learn more about Latin America,” Barrios said. “As a Latina, that is important, especially in a predominately white institution such as USC.”
But Sanchez’s mentorship and help goes past creating the new major, especially now during a time when many Latino and undocumented students like Barrios say they feel uncertain about their future under the Trump administration.
Sanchez said that during the weeks following Trump’s election, he spent eight hours a day helping students who were worried about what the future had in store for them and for their families.
“It was a pretty serious time, a lot of crying, a lot of real confusion and fear,” Sanchez said.
He added that the students were worried about serious issues while trying to do all the work others have to do. So they’ve got all those things combined.
“And that’s tough,” Sanchez said. “That’s not easy.”
Iris Verduzco, a Topping scholar and a senior majoring in law, history and culture, said she was grateful to have had Sanchez as a mentor during these tumultuous times.
“He’s just incredibly selfless,” Verduzco said. “Growing up, I’ve never been one to really talk to someone about my problems because I’ve always just been raised with that mentality that people are going through their own things and they don’t want to hear your problems on top of that, but Sanchez has always made me feel important.”
Despite his quiet and calm demeanor, Sanchez’ impact on students like Verduzco and Barrios has spoken louder than words. His relationship with underprivileged students provides insight on how professors and faculty members can lead minority students to and through higher education. The only way to ensure an educative future though, Sanchez said, is through change.
“We’re either going to be an engine for social mobility … or we’re just going to restamp the status quo all the time,” Sanchez said. “And for me, I’m not really into restamping the status quo.”

Kimberly Alvarado and Ana Mercado are two of the 750,000 DREAMers nationwide who are protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and the California Dream Act programs for undocumented people.
After former President Barack Obama issued the executive order in June 2012, many undocumented immigrants received work permits and felt protected from deportation. While the DREAM Act only applies in California, the term “DREAMers” is used to refer to undocumented people protected under DACA.
Now, under the Trump administration, undocumented students at USC like Alvarado and Mercado fear that they may be deported despite these protections.
Although President Donald Trump promised to focus deportation forces on removing criminal immigrants, Manuel Montes, a DREAMer, became the first with DACA status to be deported to Mexico. He was spending time with his girlfriend in Calexico, Calif. when immigration authorities asked for his documentation. Other than Montes, there are currently 10 DACA enrollees in custody, according to United We Dream.
For Mercado, a sophomore majoring in contemporary Latino and Latin American studies and sociology, returning to her birthplace Jalisco, Mexico would mean returning to a place she left when she was only three years old.
Mercado remembers that when she was younger, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers came to her home. She remembers her mother covering her mouth and telling her to stay quiet.
“I remember when they knocked on the door, my mom froze. Everything can go from being OK to not OK in seconds, and I felt that I started to understand that we were different,” Mercado said.  “Even though we call ourselves Americans … I am a foreigner to this country.”
Mercado is the president of the student-led group called Improving Dreams Education Access and Success at USC. The group strives to create a safe space and positive dialogue among undocumented students and allies. Despite the support of the club, Mercado still has fears for the future.
“There are a lot of scary feelings involved,” Mercado said. “I could be the next one. And it could happen at any point. USC says that we’re protected as long as we are on campus, but what happens when I go home?”
After President Donald Trump signed an executive order increasing the enforcement against undocumented immigrants, Provost Michael Quick shared a statement in support of the University’s international community.
“We want to assure you that we are fully committed to supporting all members of our Trojan Family — regardless of their national origin or religious affiliation,” the statement said. “We are proud to have, and we are better by having, a richly diverse community. We will do everything we can to ensure all of our academic community can continue to study, research and teach at USC.”
Billy Vela, the adviser of IDEAS at USC and the director of El Centro Chicano, believes that the steps Trump is taking against immigrants serve as hints to the future of his administration.
“I am deeply concerned about what can happen as [Trump] gives us hints as to what might be coming next,” Vela wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I think it’s incredibly important for the Trojan Family … to come together proactively in support of our diversity, since [Trump’s] executive orders are impacting many communities within the Trojan Family.”
Kimberly Alvarado, a sophomore majoring in psychology, was born in El Salvador and remembers being younger and feeling different from other students. She said that although she didn’t feel completely safe before the election, she is now more fearful.
“There’s fear of me being deported,” Alvarado said. “I have two little sisters, and they were born here. If, God forbid, my mom is deported, I will have to drop out of school to take care of my sisters.”
According to Niels Frenzen, the director of the USC Gould Immigration Clinic, the University is taking both official and unofficial steps to protect students on campus. He also added that the specifics about the DREAMers’ deportation are unclear.
“[The Department of Homeland Security] and Trump have recently reaffirmed that the DACA program will not be terminated,” Frenzen wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “While there have been isolated incidents of DACA immigrants being arrested by DHS, there is nothing to indicate that the new administration is pursuing DACA immigrants for deportation.”
Frenzen also said that the immigration clinic provides resources for undocumented and DACA students on campus, including one-on-one appointments and assistance when filling out immigration and DACA applications.
Even with the help provided by the University, students like Alvarado still feel that they do not belong in the country.
“Parents come to this country to give their children a better life,” Alvarado said. “We’re out here working. We’re studying. And we’re not being accepted. One of the things that hurts me the most is the United States is my home, but it doesn’t recognize me.”
DACA should be revoked and these “kids” should hire a lawyer and defend themselves in court.
This is the last and only president who will enforce Immigration laws. If Trump does not do it, this country is doomed to open borders. 
We need to secure our borders, and deport as many people as possible. They need to bring in the national guard in addition to hiring 100,000 border agents.
These illegal aliens are not protected by DACA, an unconstitutional executive order that provides very little other than deferred deportation. When they graduate, the women should return to and be unashamed of their native countries and take full advantage of their elite educations. Armed with USC diplomas, they will each succeed, prosper and become contributing citizens of their nations. That is their destiny!  That is their hope!  And in returning to their home nations, they will help them become better places in which to live and raise their families.  
The only defense for the claim that it is unconstitutional is the certainty that nobody who wants to believe Obama is an usurper will bother to check the immigration laws.
Unfortunately for the American tax payers these females will remain here and create anchor babies for US citizens to subsidize . . . and become liberal activists so they can tell the world how unfairly they have been treated.  So called “DREAMers” are criminal aliens just like their parents.  Hopefully we will see an end to DACA and “DREAMers” placed in Immigration Detention Centers where they really belong.
In 2012 illegal aliens sent home $62 BILLION in remittances back to their
countries of origin. (This is why Mexico is getting involved in our politics.)
30% percent of all Federal Prison inmates are illegal aliens.Does not include local jails and State Prisons.
$12 Billion dollars a year is spent on primary and secondary  school
education for children here illegally and they cannot speak a word of
English.
$17 Billion dollars a year is spent for education for the American-born children of illegal aliens, known as anchor babies.
$2.2 Billion dollars a year is spent on food assistance programs such as
(SNAP) food stamps, WIC, and free school lunches for illegal aliens.
$22 billion is spent on (AFDC) welfare to illegal aliens each year.
$3 Million Dollars a DAY is spent to incarcerate illegal aliens.
Nearly One Million Sex Crimes Committed by Illegal Immigrants In The United States.
The MSM would have you believe that illegals wonk only at picking fruit. This is a lie.
* Over 1.1 million illegal immigrants work in construction.
* Over 950,000 illegal immigrants work in professional and business. services
* Over 800,000 illegal immigrants work in manufacturing
* And less than 400,000 illegal immigrants work in agriculture
$200 Billion Dollars a year in suppressed American wages are caused by the illegal aliens.
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more thing that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on their life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   An award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!
What part of ILLEGAL don’t you understand.

It’s a Friday afternoon, and The Sack of Troy staff members sit in roundtable formation at their regular meeting grounds. Armed with loose-leaf paper covered in contemplative sprawls, writers enter the filtration process that comes with pitching.
The college humor organization dubs itself “USC’s second best parody news publication — after the Daily Trojan.” There are facets of The Sack of Troy’s production that mirror the inner workings of a typical news organization — articles are green-lit due to their time-sensitivity and drafts cycle through rounds of edits. Other practices make it clear that the publication is uniquely satirical. The pitching process, for instance, consists of writers rattling off headlines instead of content.
“The headline comes first,” managing editor Thomas Marshall said. “We emphasize — in comedy terms — the game. Every single joke in the piece follows that main joke in the headline.”
Upwards of 100 pitches float around the room, drawing gasps, chortles and eruptions of laughter. Only five headlines, however, pass through the publication’s gatekeeper.
Like a piano tuner identifying a musical sweet spot, Jack Hackett, The Sack of Troy editor-in-chief, identifies the headlines that present the most promise. “Scandal Erupts After Anthony Bourdain Caught Leaving Applebee’s with Wing Sauce on Collar,” for example, contains that certain joie de virve.
“I always say, ‘I’m the dumbest person in the room — look at the SAT scores, it shows,’” Hackett said. “So if I’m the dumbest person in the room and I don’t understand what you’re talking about, then other people probably won’t as well. If I don’t find it funny, then other people won’t find it funny.”
Hackett severely underplays his abilities — a combination of instinct, attention to detail and restructuring carry the momentum The Sack of Troy has gained since its infancy. Engagement is up, drawing hundreds of likes on each article posted to Facebook. Student recognition of the publication has climbed. Earlier this month, the publication received “Best Article” for at the Intercollegiate Humor Conference, judged by industry stalwarts from the Onion and Clickhole.
As The Sack of Troy leadership turns over for the upcoming school year, Marshall, Hackett and President Kim Rogers, look back at their accomplishments and the legacy they hope to cement.
Off the ground
The Sack of Troy was conceived in 2012 by a group of three friends. Axel Hellman, one of the founders of the publication, identified the absence of a satirical voice on campus.
“The Sack of Troy was actually the result of a typical elevator idea,” Hellman said. “I was in the elevator in my dorm with my friends freshman year, and the thought just came to me: Other schools have satirical newspapers. Why don’t we have that?”
After the website launched in January 2013, the production process was still very much fueled by grassroots efforts. They aimed to publish an article a week, and slowly, USC students started paying attention.
Hellman moved on from taking the publication at the helm, and Rogers was elected The Sack of Troy president at the top of her sophomore year. And that’s when things accelerated.
Hackett joined shortly after, and together, they implemented an application process. At first, this move was just for show, to add a layer of responsibility to new members. Over time, it became a method of screening talent.
“When I first came on, it was sort of casual and you just showed up to the meetings,” Rogers said. “That was fun, and people liked that, but people didn’t prioritize things because [the organization] didn’t seem super legitimate. When we were really trying to make a name for ourselves, Jack and I established the application system … Over time, that really upped our interest.”
But perhaps it’s the partnership between Rogers and Hackett — confidantes that have consolidated The Sack of Troy’s values and set a tone for the rest of the staff. According to Hackett, Rogers takes on an administrator role while he wields creative energy.
“She does a really good job with the business side of things, which I want nothing to do with,” Hackett said. “She’s also a good editor, and a really good writer, so she and I collaborate. I’ll go to her and ask, ‘Is this funny?’ Because I don’t always really know.”
It’s a collaboration that has caught the attention of Hellman, now removed from leading the pack.
“I’m pleasantly surprised about how long the club has lasted — I’d like to think it’s because I’m no longer involved,” Hellman said. “There’s a lot of organizational talent behind the scenes, and that’s why it’s so successful. I think the main thing is they have fun with it.”
A day in the life
At its core, The Sack of Troy is about comedy. But as Rogers and Hackett have strived to imbue upon their staff, their craft is a precise act, at times more science than art.
“The biggest thing I tell our writers is to know your source material,” Rogers said. “If you want to make fun of something you have to know what you’re making fun of. I always tell people to read news and really base their stuff off of that voice.”
That part comes easy to Rogers. As a junior majoring in journalism, she said she found a lot of those skills — writing in pyramid style, storytelling and communicating with other people — to transfer over to satirical news.
“They’re very intertwined,” Rogers said. “It’s definitely something that I have been able to share with my writers because it’s a very unique medium.”
In the fall, the senior editors on staff hold seminars to coach new writers into the world of comedy. The writers are taught the foundation of everything they will eventually build off — game, point of view, rule of threes.
The development of these technical skills ultimately paid off. Rogers’ article “Grandma on Oxygen Tank Pretty High and Mighty About Kids’ Technology Dependence” took “Best Article” at the Intercollegiate Humor Conference, establishing  The Sack of Troy’s presence on the collegiate humor scene.
“It was our first year there, and [our publication is], like, four years old when a lot of these humor magazines have been around for decades,” Rogers said. “I think for everyone who was there, it was really fruitful, and it really made us appreciate how far we’ve come.”
Making an impact
The rise of The Sack of Troy comes at a time when conventional news organizations are criticized for their inability to hold institutions and public officials responsible for their actions. Earlier this month, Vox analyzed CNN and satirical news program coverage of the Trump administration side-by-side. The comparisons suggested that CNN, committed to objectivity, failed to effectively hold President Donald Trump accountable. Talk show host Seth Meyers, however, demonstrated a low tolerance for the president’s claims.
It’s a phenomenon that The Sack of Troy members absorb and harness.
“Satire is more powerful than you think, especially now in this political climate,” Hackett said. “I don’t know if it affects Trump in the slightest — it might affect his personal ego. But I think [satire] has larger effects than we initially see.”
Underneath the bite and grit of the humor, The Sack of Troy understands the onus it shoulders. According to Marshall, the best stories examine the discrimination of marginalized people.
“[The responsibility of The Sack of Troy] is more than the responsibility of the USC memes page, which is a great community of comedy,” Marshall said. “What we do a little differently is cut through some bullsh-t and really get at the issues. At least for me, a lot of where I come in in my articles is not, ‘this is a joke’ — I want to actually help people.”
Looking ahead
It’s in today’s political climate that Rogers and Hackett step down as president and editor-in-chief, respectively. Before they bow out, however, in true satirical form, their staff members will host “The Sack of Troy Presents: The Roast of Kim Rogers & Jack Hackett” to honor their leadership.
“You only roast the ones you love, and we barely tolerate Kim and Jack,” the Facebook event page reads, “so this should be interesting.”
Of course, the members of Sack of Troy are just being satirical.
Because the energy as the Friday meeting concludes is still tangible, and it’s obvious that this group of people share a bond weaved together by their creativity. It is, after all, a writer’s room.
“This writer’s room is super fun to be in because it’s a lot of bouncing ideas off each other,” Marshall said. “The atmosphere is so uniquely supportive, and I hope that’s the lasting impact.”
Does anyone remember USC’s “Wampus” magazine and Art Buchwald? Great things have come from satire at USC!

USC is one of many college communities that have created its own meme page: an online space where students share images, videos and phrases that are altered creatively or humorously for the entertainment of their peers.
Memes are just the latest Internet-bred phenomenon breaking into the cultural mainstream. As a result, appreciating, sharing and creating memes is second nature to many today. “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” is a public Facebook group that was created in November 2016 by freshmen Megan Andersen and Elise Vondra in response to the meme page phenomena that took over several California colleges, such as “UC Berkeley Memes for Edgy Teens” and “UCLA Memes for Sick AF Tweens.” Andersen, Vondra and freshman John Lynch are the three group administrators who regulate the page’s daily content.
The page did not pick up momentum until this past semester when more of the student population joined. Now, the page has nearly 15,500 members comprised of USC students as well as students from other universities across the nation, an outreach the creators did not anticipate.
“When [Megan] and I created the page back in November, we joked around a lot about striving to get 50 or 100 members,” Vondra said. “We really did not expect for the page to grow so much, or to get as much student interaction as we do.”
Much like a small-scale civil society, the page ebbs and flows with greater cultural trends as well as its own campus-specific fashions.
With new changes on campus comes new waves of memes — student annoyance toward the barricaded walkway in front of the Seeley G. Mudd building spurred a series of mocking memes. As the academic year winds to a close, the page is flooded with photos that evoke relatable feelings of cramming for final exams or graduating without job prospects. Following the early shut down of Springfest before headliner Rae Sremmurd could perform, students took to the meme page to express disappointment and criticize Concerts Committee’s poor planning.
Most recently, outrage over scarcity of spots in the USC Village set to open in Fall 2017 inspired memes that teased President C.L. Max Nikias for the general unrest resulting from Village construction and for his obsession with the new neo-Gothic university signage, dubbed “Pointy Things.” The mass attention to “Pointy Things” on the meme page became the catalyst for several student-run business ventures selling T-shirts and laptop stickers bearing Photoshopped images of Nikias gleefully straddling a “Pointy Thing.”
The stickers campaign, titled “Pointy Things for Spoiled Pre-Teens” were spearheaded by junior Luke McGartland, junior Erik Byargeon, senior Andrew Ullmann and senior Lukas Huberman. Online orders were available through Indiegogo and the campaign earned $610 with the vision “to bring a Nikias to every home!” The site also credits the USC Facebook meme group as the inspiration for the idea.
“I think the meme page actually gives students a place to come together from different social circles across campus and have some fun making light of different things going on at USC,” McGartland said.
Faizus Amin, a Muslim Student Union student leader, presented Nikias with a “Pointy Thing” figurine he had created with a 3-D printer, much to the amusement of Nikias himself and the members of the meme group.
“Investments into campus aesthetic with the pointy things has united the student body and the Trojan Family,” Amin told Nikias during their meeting. “Students of all backgrounds, races and politics have come together to discuss the absurdity behind the pointy things on a new platform … Memes! The meme page has really connected students from all backgrounds into one hilarious environment where we can all playfully poke fun at each other and about our campus.”
After meeting with Amin, Nikias became aware of the existence and impact of the meme page, posting his acknowledgement and support on his Instagram account.
With a dozen new memes posted daily to the page, “USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens” is already deeply integrated into campus culture as a binding force and with an impact that will only grow wider. In spite of the diversity in the student population and today’s polarizing sociopolitical landscape, the meme page provides a platform for everyone to come together, laugh and agree, at the very least, that computer science majors need to learn to shower.

Technology is one hell of a thing. Safely tucked into my cozy bed, I was able to watch the entire Kendrick Lamar Coachella set live from my laptop. Would I rather be there in person? I’m not too sure, since Coachella tickets cost an arm and a leg these days, but I imagine the experience was unlike anything else.
To see one of your favorite artists live is truly a privilege for a number of reasons. In many ways, a live show gives you a sensation that a digital recording will never give you, and that is seeing an artist perform with emotion and raw energy on stage. Artists bring their A-game when it comes to performing at Coachella especially, since it’s one of the most energetic audiences most artists will ever play for in their lives.
Seeing a mixed crowd of original and new fans coming together to see their show is a dream for an artist. Nearly everyone has heard of Lady Gaga by now, but maybe some fans are only familiar with her fantastic first album, The Fame, which means they haven’t heard her more socially conscious albums and songs that she made more recently. Every audience at a festival like Coachella is expecting one thing and one thing only: to hear some good music and have a good time.
Kaytranada is one artist who, in my opinion, embodies this sentiment when he performs. Whether you’re familiar with his music or not, he’s going to make sure you have a great time constantly moving on your feet to the good vibes he’s playing. Before Coachella stages, he played to much smaller audiences in much smaller spaces. Despite these limitations, he was able to get everyone moving and grooving, which is truly a beautiful thing; everyone came together to enjoy some good tunes and have a good time.
This is also why I think concerts are one of the greatest wonders in this world, since people can put aside their differences and come together over an artist they enjoy. I’ll never forget my first concert: Disclosure’s Wild Life at Freedom Hill on Aug. 2, 2014. It was one of the last things I did before leaving for my freshman year of college, and it was definitely one of the most memorable.
Throughout the night, I saw an Indian man rhyme with a black man to every line of every song ScHoolboy Q played, an entire section of a crowd lose their minds when Ryan Hemsworth dropped a Waka Flocka Flame song in the mix and a 40-year-old man stay in the front row with a group of 20-year-olds for Disclosure’s entire three-hour set. By far, my favorite moment from that concert was when my friend gave a guy who didn’t speak a lick of English and had been dancing nonstop to Disclosure two thumbs up, to which he responded with a large smile and a quick hug.
This is the power that concerts can have. People from all over the world, of any race, age and religion, can come together and share an experience with other people just to have fun. If people showed each other the same kind of compassion and kindness I’ve seen at concerts, the world would be a much better place. There’s a general understanding that everyone attending a concert will follow the motto of  “Peace Love Unity Respect”, an acronym that was born in rave culture many years ago. I think that the world could use some PLUR right now.
Writing this column for a year has helped me think some things out, especially when it comes to music’s larger role in life other than just as entertainment. Concerts are a testament to the necessity of music to allow people to come together. The next time you want to break the ice with someone you want to get to know better, ask them who their favorite artist is. Ask them what their best experience at a concert was. Ask them what the last song they listened to was. Ask your mom and dad what their favorite album was when they were your age — shout-out to my No. 1 fans, Mom and Dad. You might learn something interesting about someone based on the kind of music they’re into, and it might even bring you closer together. Why? Because music makes the world go ’round.
Thanks for reading. It’s been fun to write for you.

“I lived for my art, I lived for love,” Floria Tosca sang, heartbroken, to a Madonna statue in Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca last Saturday night. Conducted by James Conlon and directed by John Caird, Tosca returned to Los Angeles to tell a classic tale about the sacrifices for love and liberty.
Set against a backdrop of civil unrest, Tosca is about Tosca and her lover, artist Cavaradossi, and their respective sacrifices in order to do what is right. The villain, Baron Scarpia, chief of police, uses Tosca’s jealousy and insecurity about her and Cavaradossi’s relationship to track down Cesare Angelotti, an Italian Republican who has just escaped from jail and is currently getting aid from Cavaradossi. What ensues is the heartbreaking tale of Tosca being torn between love and justice — will she give herself up to Scarpia in order to save Cavaradossi’s life? Will Cavaradossi live, even if the compromise is made? Who will come out alive or dead in this tale of sacrifice?
LA Opera’s performance of Tosca captures the heart of the story beautifully through its exceptional talent and design. Puccini’s classic begs for a certain level of expertise when it comes to capturing the emotions of each character because story arcs like Tosca’s are complex and layered, and they need to be revealed smoothly within the performance. LA Opera carefully crafted the opera’s narrative, given its backdrop of the 1800s Habsburg dynasty in Italy and religious motifs and overtones.
Sondra Radvanovsky’s return to the eponymous role of Tosca is thrilling. Already known for her work as Tosca in the LA Opera’s production in 2013, Radvanovsky’s experience with the complexities of Tosca’s character and songs shines through in her bold performance. Her control of voice is spectacular, enhancing the emotions of the scenes with her shifts from strong, loud vibratos to soft, graceful notes. After singing to the Madonna statue in front of her, lamenting about the decision to leave Cavaradossi and spare his life, Radvanovsky received a long applause with a couple of standing ovations, well-deserved for her emotionally stirring acting and superb voice control. Radvanosky captures the duality of Tosca elegantly — the boldness of Tosca’s passion for Cavaradossi is carefully contrasted against the soft, vulnerable love she has for a man that has truly loved her back.
Russell Thomas, who plays Cavaradossi, is spectacular as well. Thomas’ voice is as passionate as the personality of the painter, and he is incredibly emotive in his body language, adding to the show’s flow with his challenges against Scarpia and his tender embraces of Tosca. His vibrato is strong and powerful, much like Cavaradossi’s courage in the face of death and his passion in the face of love. When Thomas and Radvanosky sing together in perfect harmony, the entire theater becomes energized.
James Conlon and his orchestra do not disappoint. Their fantastic execution of Puccini’s stirring music help guide the audience, amplifying emotions of characters and alluding to plot points. They are actors in this performance, leading the audience deeper into the story. The most fantastic example is when Cavaradossi is alone in prison, writing his final letter to Tosca.  Conlon and his orchestra perfectly execute the shift in the mood of the music; their change from the somber song to a love theme helps the audience realize that Tosca is coming, and when she walks through the door, their reunion becomes even sweeter.
Major props also go to the set design of Bunny Christie. The use of the stage’s space is fantastic, and the intricate details of the designs enhance the narrative while also creating a sense of realism. Christie’s church looks as if it belongs with the ancient churches that fill the streets of Rome, and the framing of a Madonna statue in Scarpia’s apartment after Tosca’s first sacrifice beautifully enhances the atmosphere and amplifies Tosca’s actions. The layers of the set design make the opera even more accessible to the audience, and with each bloody curtain drop, the audience goes deeper into Tosca’s life.
LA Opera’s Tosca perfectly encapsulates the passions that drive the opera, thanks to the incredible talent behind it. Tosca’s return to Los Angeles is well-wanted and well-deserved.
In September 2009 I heard Sondra Radvanovsky in Ernani in Chicago.  My impression of her then was that she was loud.  That was all.  I am so delighted to sense how her artistry has blossomed since then.  What a pleasure to watch and listen to.

In Los Angeles’ diverse culinary and cultural communities, many locals have sampled boba — or bubble tea — of some sort. Invented in the 1980s in Taiwan, boba has become a staple urban drink. Dana Café Boba attempts to cater to this local desire for boba, but it falls short with the quality of its drinks.
Dana Café Boba is a relatively new establishment that occupies a tiny corner on South Vermont Avenue and West 43rd Street. Patrons passing by would risk missing the tiny store, if not for a bright yellow sign above the doorway. Upon entering the cafe, customers are confronted with bright yellow and green walls, alongside quirky posters that diagram boba’s complex creation.
The interior was not designed for waiting customers; the majority of the space was dominated by the kitchen and service counter. Stools pushed up against the window offered a place for guests to sit while their drinks were made, but most of their seating was offered outside the store.
In terms of food, Dana Café Boba offered little variety. Cheetos with cheese sauce and ice cream cones were advertised, but there were no unique products. Instead, the main focus was on their many drinks. From slushes to shakes to frosty milk, the shop featured a wide variety of options for a wide variety of tastes. Drinks cost $3.95 while coffee and food items ranged from $1.50 to $6. Customers could also choose to include add-ons for an additional price. The drink prices were pleasantly low, especially on a college student’s budget.
However, the largest section of the menu was Dana’s slushes. With 30 flavors ranging from watermelon to Thai tea, there is a slush flavor for every guest. The strawberry slush was especially refreshing; the lightness of the drink was a satisfying treat without overwhelming taste. The texture was smooth, and the boba complemented it well.
The mango shaved ice, one of the cafe’s non-drink options, failed to meet the level of its slush drinks. Served in a cup rather than a bowl, the dish mixed mango chunks, shaved ice, ice cream and boba together. Though the product was tasty, the combination of  ingredients was disappointing. There was not enough ice, too much mango and an overwhelming amount of boba.
The peach smoothie also did not meet expectations. Although slushes and smoothies may seem simple, a smoothie’s ingredients are integral to its overall presentation and taste. The structure of the peach smoothie did not maintain itself for long, and it quickly separated into three distinct layers: boba, liquids and solid peach chunks. The mix of fruits, drink and boba created an unpleasant consistency and bitterness that were repugnant to taste buds.
The true star of bubble tea is not meant to be the drinks — it’s the boba. Unfortunately, the boba itself posed a problem in most of the drinks. The texture ranged from perfectly chewy boba to half-frozen, crunchy balls. Overall, the boba’s textures remained inconsistent in the drinks, especially in the strawberry slush. Though most of the boba pieces were easy to chew, the select few frozen pieces ruined the balance of the drink and demonstrated the shop’s careless drink creation.
Upon sampling their various offerings, it appears that Dana Café Boba is more an attempt to ride the coattails of the current boba trend rather than create quality beverages.

Since the advent of “You Do Uterus” in January, I’ve strayed from referencing my personal life in an effort to avoid making this column about me. Rather, every week, I’ve made it a goal to try my best to use this column as a platform to speak to the experiences of as many women as possible.
Then, last week, an influx of allegations that former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had fostered a culture of sexual harassment and disrespect toward female employees began to dominate the news cycle. I was shocked by the extent to which this news affected me. The allegations reminded me of the very personal experiences that have defined me as a feminist and as a woman, and additionally reminded me of universal elements of womanhood that I’ve failed to address in “You Do Uterus” this semester.
Allegations against O’Reilly vary in levels of lewdness — they range from name-calling to violent threats to masturbating on the phone with women, but they all indicate one thing: To O’Reilly, women were sex objects, plain and simple.
I don’t reference this scandal because I’m naive enough to believe that a man using a woman’s gender and appearance to degrade, sexualize and intimidate her is some rare, monumental phenomenon. It’s terrible; it’s soul-crushing; it’s utterly disgusting — but ask any woman, and you’ll find it’s neither rare nor monumental.
Ultimately, this scandal and the uncomfortable, infuriating details take me back to being 16 years old. Because when I think about how I became who I am today, that’s where it all starts.
Like pretty much any other high school student in a predominantly wealthy, Asian American Bay Area suburb, I was clumsily chasing perfect grades and doing whatever it took to please my loving, albeit demanding, parents. But outside of this, I was also dealing with a personal hell — a poorly timed sexual awakening fraught with pressure, shame, disapproval and, naturally, sexual harassment. The details were messy and, for any normal person, deeply uncomfortable, and I’ll happily withhold them.
But there were some defining incidents I’ll never forget, no matter how hard I try to — incidents that stared me in the face and told me, “You are a woman, and this is what it means to be a woman.”
I will never forget the horror and disappointment of my mother, whose favorite thing in the world was to take me to church every Sunday morning, when she received a phone call from a peer who claimed I had had sex with another girl’s boyfriend. That was when I began to realize that no one is half as interested in truth and women’s perspectives as they are in narratives that label, blame and degrade women.
As far as all the people who heard things through the hateful, sexist grapevine knew, he and I had allegedly done the same terrible thing, yet I watched as he was vindicated, forgiven, even treated as a victim, while I faced ostracism, slut-shaming, even the involvement of my parents as if I deserved blame and punishment and he did not. I repeat: He and I had allegedly done the same terrible thing. The difference was that I was female. I was a “slut.”
It’s a matter of objective fact demonstrated by case studies and research spanning over the course of decades — where young women are punished and maligned for being sexually active, for making choices about their bodies, in contrast, young men are glorified. Granted, the context was not quite so simple, but my experiences revealed a lot to me.
And it certainly didn’t help my case that I could count on two hands the days I chose to wear a bra over the course of my four years in high school. To be called a “whore,” a “slut” — to my back, to my face, to my friends and, as previously noted, even to my mother — for having the audacity to be young and female and, God forbid, make choices about my body, prioritize my physical comfort, explore and be myself — almost three years later, I’m grateful for all of these experiences that have allowed me to grow. But I’m not going to sit here and lie that it wasn’t painful, even traumatic for me, at the time.
I know that my experiences do not speak to those of transgender women whose right to use the bathroom is a matter of contentious political debate. My experiences do not speak to those of young women born into communities where they are more likely to be trafficked than to receive an education, of Muslim women whose hijabs are ripped from their heads for the supposed crime of walking down the street. My experiences do not speak to those of women in rural communities whose bodily autonomy has been sold away to gratify ideological hardliners, to the experiences of the sexual assault survivors who are looked in the eye and called liars by law enforcement.
But my experiences speak to the definition of the seemingly lighthearted pun-slash-feminist rallying cry, “You Do Uterus.” That is, no matter the color of our skin, what genitals we were born with, what career paths we choose to pursue, whether or not we want marriage or children — we all have defining experiences that show us what it means to be a woman. And we all respond to these experiences in our own ways.
That is the beauty of womankind — our diversity of identity and experience, and ultimately, our resilience. We take those diverse experiences and make choices about how we respond to them, rise above them, transform them into something meaningful.
When I was 15 and my greatest worry in life was the possibility of getting a B+ in my chemistry class, my father gave me the only piece of advice I’ve ever needed since. There are only two kinds of problems: problems you can solve, and problems you can work around.
But over the years, from all the personal losses and struggles — some of which crushed me, some of which I truly believed at the time that I would never rebound from — I’ve realized there is a third kind of problem that my father failed to note: the kind of problem that you grow and reinvent yourself from.
And I’ve discovered this because I am a woman, and for all that I’ve experienced and pushed myself through because of this, I take immense pride in being one. I can’t wait to share this advice from my father, modified by my experiences as a woman, with my daughters someday (because yes, I want to have children, and no, that doesn’t make me any less of a feminist).
From harassment and pain, I found empowerment in self-expression, in learning about the experiences of others, both similar to and different from mine. I found it in researching, writing, absorbing perspectives and making cohesive written arguments. Writing was how I processed, responded to and overcame my struggles as a woman. It’s not for everyone, but it certainly was fulfilling for me.
One of the first opinion pieces I ever published was called “I’m a teen victim of sexual harassment and here’s why Free the Nipple matters to me,” which I wrote for Feministing in response to the treatment I received as a result of my lifestyle choice. I read back on it two years later and the language, syntax, sentence structure — all of it makes me cringe. But regardless, when I read it, I remain empowered because I can pinpoint the exact moment that I started to become me. The night I wrote that piece — that was it.
The latest Fox News scandal struck a chord with me because sexual harassment is precisely the force that tore me away from my otherwise cozy, privileged life. It was what forced me to care and educate myself about the pain of others who faced identity-based attacks and oppression greater than what I faced. That was what made me realize my yearning to devote the rest of my life to writing about and shining a light on all of these experiences.
And when I think about how few of these allegations against O’Reilly were new, how many have been in circulation for years, I think of the people who raise their brows in pessimism, who express doubt when I tell them some of the words I’ve been called, the things people have said and done to me. And at once, I empathize.
To me, “You Do Uterus” is a phrase that acknowledges the vast range of experiences of those who identify as women around the world. It acknowledges the diversity of choices we make, and how those experiences and those choices are what make us the unique, equally valuable women we are.
Kylie Cheung is a freshman majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You Do Uterus,” ran every Thursday.
A modest and respectful suggestion: If you want to counter stereotypes about women, consider switching from journalism to a hard-sciences major. It’s probably the single most effective move you could make. Change starts at home.
It seems reasonable that a feminist would do whatever they choose and shut up about it.  Your tiresome and boring tripe underscores your need for more meaningful activities in life.  How would you “feel” if a man wrote a column called “You Do Penis”?  Ah, equal treatment is a pain.

Talk show host Bill Maher has a thorn in his side, and it’s college kids.
His statements last Friday on Real Time with Bill Maher seemed to ally himself with conservative commentator Ann Coulter in her recent efforts to speak at the University of California, Berkeley. But they also spoke to Maher’s broader annoyance with university students across the country.
“They invite someone to speak who’s not exactly what liberals want to hear, and they want to shutter it,” he complained to that evening’s guest, conservative commentator S.E. Cupp.
Though Maher does not himself proclaim to be politically liberal, it is noteworthy that his efforts to reach out to extremely conservative personalities such as Coulter largely separate him from other political talk show hosts who use their air time to promote mostly liberal views.
In February, Maher rose to some notoriety for hosting far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos on Real Time after the infamous far-right personality was prevented from speaking at Berkeley for his own safety, due to campus protests that turned physically destructive. And yet, Maher’s preference to attack students’ voices and favor lectures from Yiannopoulos and Coulter demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding on his part, of what free speech entails and the media’s responsibility to handle it productively.
It goes without saying that free speech is paramount to American democracy. But it is difficult to understand how that translates into Maher’s hosting a hateful person on his show and imploring college students to listen to prejudiced speakers on campus. And moreover, it is curious that for someone as adamant about free speech as Maher claims to be, he is also just as fixated on not speaking: specifically, the silence he demands from college students who may have something to say about the nature of certain speakers on their campus.
Of course, it is important to note that Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking at Berkeley because protests made the environment physically unsafe — and destructive action should never be tolerated, no matter how reviled the subject of a protest. But for those students who protested peacefully, who exercised their free speech respectfully, it was offensive and obnoxious for Maher to render their voices useless by extending an invitation to Yiannopoulos to come on his show, in a quiet studio unreachable by dissenting opinion.
What Maher and critics like him — who all, incidentally, tend to be of his age — don’t seem to understand is that students have every right to speak as the adults they are protesting. Evidently, Maher does not seem to grasp the motivation of peaceful student protesters — that students speak out not just because they disagree with Yiannopoulos and Coulter but also because they are worried what will come of those who listen to them. Will someone agree? Will someone change their minds on previously held values? Will someone begin to believe them?
It’s where Maher’s statement about Yiannopoulos — that “nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed” — begins to crumble, because if everyone knows Yiannopoulos is an idiot, why then must the media take him seriously? American students are right to be worried: Give a man a microphone, and there will always be those who walk away swayed by him.
Most tellingly, if Maher purports that exposure alone will rip the rug from under Yiannopoulos’ feet and the feet of speakers like him, then it is incomprehensible why when Yiannopoulos made the statement about actress Leslie Jones: “I said that she looked like a dude, which she does.”
Maher then replied: “Right.”
Yiannopoulos has an ugly history of trolling Jones, harassing her so vehemently that he drove her from Twitter. But for Maher to utter even a single syllable that agreed with the vitriol of his bitter guest? It is this statement that most firmly draws back the curtain on Maher’s costume of free speech warrior, that proves he called Yiannopoulos onto his show not to challenge or prove him wrong, but instead to make a point in the most highfalutin, overhanded way.
Even if it meant giving this man a platform through which he could reach millions.
Yes, Yiannopoulos made a fool of himself on Maher’s show, but this is not a revelation — no matter how much Maher would like to pat himself on the back for it. Yiannopoulos is a known provocateur and bigot, and the media has given him enough attention in the span of his short-lived, vocal career. It is true that in the past few months, the American public has witnessed Yiannopoulos’ downfall (due to recent statements from him that seemed to condone pedophilia), but it had nothing to do with Maher.
If Maher must insist on putting spotlights on controversial people, he need only look to fellow talk show host Trevor Noah of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show for how to do it right: specifically, an episode where Noah grilled conservative Tomi Lahren, formerly of TheBlaze, on her extreme views against issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement.
Lahren has, in the past month, stepped away from conservative pundit-dom for her pro-choice views on abortion — which resulted in her being fired from TheBlaze, leading her to promptly sue for wrongful termination. But that’s beside the point. What is the point is that her and Noah’s conversation on The Daily Show proves a shining example for how to handle controversial, conservative guests whose viewpoints may disagree with those of the majority of the show’s audience: engage them, challenge them and use words — not silence — to prove them wrong. That is the point of free speech, not to give the likes of Yiannopoulos a platform to talk unabated and then shush the people who take offense by his rhetoric.
Perhaps because he himself was once almost kept from speaking on the UC Berkeley campus, Maher seems to take a particular issue with that school, the same college where protests prevented Yiannopoulos from speaking and which now also shut out Coulter. On last Friday’s episode of Real Time, Maher condescended to his audience that “Berkeley, you know, used to be the cradle of free speech, and now it’s just the cradle for f-cking babies.”
Crybabies, snowflakes, whiners … where have students heard that one before?  Perhaps most gravely of all, Maher’s criticism reflects the pushback many students felt in the days after Trump’s election, when white and conservative voters told them not to overreact to the prospect of a Trump presidency.
But the fact remains: Only a very specific demographic of the population can point at the diverse, colorful, sprawling American student body and tell them they are exaggerating about today’s whirlwind political climate. And the very act of accusing someone of overreacting to current events is so rich in unrealized privilege that it makes Maher seem naive. His penchant for jumping so quickly to criticize America’s youth aligns itself exactly with the sensitivity and narrow-mindedness he claims to oppose in students.
Maher’s move to congratulate himself as a free speech, anti-political correctness advocate, when what he’s actually advocating for is student silence, is not something young people should easily forgive nor forget. Maher displays not a penchant for free speech but instead a deep and imbedded contempt for American youth and their rights to express themselves. It has always been so easy to make fun of young people and what they say and believe in, but from someone as acerbic as Maher — it is disheartening to see and not worth young people’s time to watch.
“American students are right to be worried: Give a man a microphone, and there will always be those who walk away swayed by him.”
I’m as liberal as anyone and can’t stand Coulter, but this argument is disturbing to me. You’re literally arguing people can’t be trusted to hear information and arrive at their own conclusions, and that they need others to filter out what information even reaches their ears.
I’m not expecting a response from the author, but is your real concern that the “opposing” side will make a better argument than you, so might as well prevent them from ever having that chance? 
OMG.  “But for those students who protested peacefully, who exercised their free speech respectfully, it was offensive and obnoxious for Maher to render their voices useless by extending an invitation to Yiannopoulos to come on his show, in a quiet studio unreachable by dissenting opinion.”
Wow.  At least people like the author are not headed for true positions of power.  Otherwise, we’d be doomed for sure.
No one is forcing any students to listen to people like Milo Yiannopoulos on campuses but a case could be made that various students groups, including at USC, attempt to force students not listen to him at an on campus event. This demonstrates that these groups have a far more demeaning perspective of college students these days than Maher does; they believe the students of today are so gullible, weak minded and lacking any discernment or basic intelligence that they must be protected by someone else from hearing certain free speech lest they end up believing  and adhering to the message of that speech.
Nobody is saying students cannot protest. The issue is that these protesting student are shutting down speakers who were invited to speak by other students who want to hear them.
School administrators have both encouraged and allowed this to take place. And everybody knows that it is coming from only one side of the political aisle.
These events are being paid for by media manipulators. These are not innocent people trying to speak freely. His whole shtick is to start crap, it has nothing to do with expressing any intelligence. He is a click bait yellow journalism marder. You know this though.
It doesn’t matter who pays for it, the fact is that speakers are invited by students and student organizations all the time. Shutting down one of these invited speakers because you don’t like their opinion is a violation of the first amendment (at least at a public university).
“These are not innocent people trying to speak freely”
Who exactly is the objective arbiter that decides if that is true or not?
Why, silly wabbit, the left gets to decide because (and you can find this out by asking them) they are all-knowing and we are know-nothings who are blessed to have the left guide us through life.  {Sarc/off}
What an arrogant, hypocritical and blind people the left is.
Shutting down a contrary opinion is a violation of the 1st Amendment no matter the school private or public.
I don’t know this and I also don’t know what a marder is?
The author of this article shows his hypocracy by making his hatred of Milo and Ann Coultet very obvious when he calls their speech hateful. I have listened to many of Milos speaches and find nothing hateful. And when Toni Lahren quotes people alinged with the BLM she is right in pointing out THEIR hatred – the BLM movement promotes violence and hate. The author seems to argue that Ann Coulter and Milo should not be allowed to speak because the students don’t agree with them yet they were asked to speak by student groups at the college. The author then goes to say the students should have a right to speak out against what Milo and Coulter think. Will guess what you’ve already have liberal speakers come and speak at your college. Where are the conservative voices? Some of your students want to have someone come and speak about their beliefs to speak out against the liberal guest speakers you’ve already had on campus. This article is a joke. These people may be right wing and maybe you don’t agree with them but they were invited by a student organization to come and speak they were given permission originally by the college to come and speak they should be allowed to speak. If you don’t like them that is fine if you want to protest them stand peacefully outside and protest them. But the threats of violence the throwing of objects the breaking of windows creating walls of bodies to block people from getting in or forcing your way in through security is not the way to handle this. Bill Maher Milo yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter are all exactly right and the writer of this article is a prime example of what is wrong with our society today especially amongst a large percentage of the younger generation.
Oh you poor ” Crybabies, snowflakes, whiners ” you have know idea what the real world is like and when you do go out into it you will long for your safe space.
So any/all speech should be freely expressed in public settings as long as it isn’t “hateful”?  Who makes that judgment?  It looks like another ruse to stifle free speech.  Only you could interpret Maher’s statements as an attempt to silence students.  Your tortured and twisted reasoning is an embarrassment to your generation.  That said, it is your right to express absurdities. Time for a safe space.  Your triggers are killing me.
Someone needs a safe space.  
What is happening at Kal is akin to fascism by the students, if in fact they are the ones causing the unsafe atmosphere that is killing free speech on that campus. However, Antifa is not s student movement though there may be student members in the rank and file, but it is organized and funded by anarchists.  If you are aligned with this movement then you are a fascist, a hater of American values. Antifa is the modern day version of the KKK. If you have to wear masks and cover your face to hide our identity when exercising your actions then you are the enemy, the haters, the creeps of society.  
Shutting down Milo, Ann or others who have a different option of yours is what dictators do, not Americans.  
“Antifa is the modern day version of the KKK” You fundamentally misunderstand both of these groups. While I disagree with Antifa tactics and think there is a hypocritical element to their use of violence, it doesn’t do the conversation any good for you to conflate the two groups.
Both groups are supported and funde by the Democrats.
Both groups hide their faces behind a mask and numbers.
Both groups are haters of any contrary position or mm perspective.
Though I could agree with you, we both would be wrong, but then… I digress.
“Both groups are supported and funde (sic) by the Democrats.”
This is 100% false. The KKK had ties to the Democrats in both the 1800’s and 1900’s, but there is no credible evidence for your statement. The Anarchists (Antifa) are despised by both Democrats and Republicans, and the feelings are mutual. Anarchy has a rich intellectual lineage and has always been an anti-fascist philosophy (see the Spanish Civil War). 
Your statements are right out of the Breitbart and Infowars media stream. They consistently lie and warp partial facts to create propaganda. If you want to read independent and honest news I suggest that you check out Democracy Now!
The KKK has been around since the days you mention, however, it is still around and Dixiecrats are still inbolved.  Hillary Clinton’s mentor was Sen Robert Byrd, a grand wizard in his day.
Antifa is not despised by the Dems as they promote and fund their activities.  Yes, Antifa has been around a very long time, but mostly in Europe and have not raised their ugliness in the US until last year.  They are anti-Trump.  They are pro Democrat, and since the Dems have not made any officially statements about Antifa, they are guilty by association and silence.  If in fact, the New American Socialist Party USA (Dems) do nto want to be affiliated with this terrible alt-left group, then they should be making public statements stating so.  You hear nothing from Schumer, Pelosi, or even their lord and savior Barack Obama.  
Thanks for the tip on the Democracy Now pub. I’ll check it out as I’m open to other thoughts and positions…… but remain a conservatarian.
Byrd has publicly apologized for his racist past and I don’t think we can fault Clinton (despite her numerous faults) for Byrd’s past anyways.
Some Dems have come out to condemn the blac bloc violence.
“Berkeley has a proud history of dissent and students were fully within their rights to protest peacefully. However, I am disappointed by the unacceptable acts of violence last night which were counterproductive and dangerous,”
 – Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland)
But you are right to point the finger at Pelosi, who seems to have only said,
“If there is an infiltration of the crowd by those that are less than peaceful, that should be addressed,”.
It seems to me that that Dem constituents are getting fed up with Pelosi and she’ll be on her way out soon.
All of this being said, your point about being guilty by association seems like a fallacy of logic (possibly, affirming the consequent). I also think it’s wrong to say that Anarchists are pro-Democrat, though I would cede that they prefer Democrats to Republicans.
The Democratic party is certainly not the “New American Socialist Party”. Democratic market socialists, like myself, find the majority of Democrats nearly identical to Republicans on a large number of economic issues. It’s easy to make blanket assumptions about both parties (sure, I do it too), but they each have increasingly diverse views within the parties. It’s really a shame that we have to lump everyone into one of two parties.  
I recommended Democracy Now because even though I consider them to be a progressive news source, they seem to have a very diverse audience and I think there is a hunger for their reporting across the political spectrum. 
Cheers

Two years ago, I never expected to get into half the schools that granted me admission. When I was 16 I was mired in a self-imposed and perpetual Catch-22 — exceptionally high expectations of myself paired with exceptionally low confidence in my own abilities. I got into USC. They offered me a scholarship, and I took it. It wasn’t the best school I got into. But I had a deep love for this university, and it demonstrated how much it valued me. I related to this school’s underdog success story. It had grit. It had ambition. And it went the extra mile.
I threw myself into university life with aggression and persistence. Call it the old college try, maybe, but it was an adrenaline rush you can only experience when you feel like you’re on the edge of the world, at the beginning of your future. I still remember a line from Elton John’s Broadway hit Aida: “If you don’t like your life, change it.”
It was slow and it was sudden: I excelled in my classes. I was on the editorial board of the Daily Trojan. I was shaking hands with Sen. Kamala Harris on the Executive Board of the College Democrats. I was doing political panels for the University, airing on local TV, speaking at events. I was producing TrojanVision’s flagship political talk and debate show, I was going to work at the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics — a dream come true. I was receiving internship offers. I grew up, came into myself. I never knew the doors that could be opened if only one sought to try. I felt impactful, involved and alive.
And then the halls didn’t feel the same. After a couple of years I was capable of different things, and I had bigger goals. It was as though I had grown up here, and then grown out of it. I was questioning whether I ended up at a place that could really offer me everything I wanted. I started playing around with the idea of transferring to the East Coast. The University felt smaller. I remembered, again, that this wasn’t the best school I got into. Did I settle?
Yesterday, I got a call at work. It was the mother of an admitted student, desperately wanting to know what the Unruh Institute could offer. Did I enjoy the political science department? Did I think it was helpful, and had I made connections? What had USC done for me, what was possible at the University? She knew USC had everything her daughter needed — and wanted — to get to the places she wanted to go, but tuition was steep. How did anyone ever come up with it? She was desperate for solutions and very, very sad.
I found myself selling the University. Explaining the sudden swath of opportunities that had become available to me after laying down roots in University Park. This was the best school for me — and for prospective students like this high schooler — because it was a university made up of ambitious people. The Wall Street Journal recently ranked USC 15th in the nation, and this was mostly due to the determination of the administration, faculty and student body. When we got off the phone, I hoped I had helped her. I realized she had helped me, too.
The ability to materialize nearly $70,000 out of thin air should not be the deciding factor in whether a qualified student attends a university. That price tag may well be the reason we lose that particular student’s talent and potential to another school. If we are determined to continue that rise to the top, we should also remember that we can’t only be selecting students from the very small pool of American families who can afford such a steep tuition cost. Merit scholarships and various meticulous grants are not enough, and often do not add up to a reasonable level of support. But that’s another conversation altogether.
For now, as our annual Admitted Students Reception approaches, I’ll offer the lesson I recently learned: It pays to remember how lucky we all are to be here. More than 84 percent of students who applied were not as fortunate, nor were the countless others who achieved admission but couldn’t meet the costs. Honor that good fortune by contributing to the success story. We can all make USC what we want it to be. If you don’t like your University — change it.
Lily Vaughan is a sophomore majoring in history and political science. “Trojan Talk” is a guest column that typically ran every other week.
Is the writer suggesting that people donate money to USC in order to improve the financial-aid packages?
Glib, glossed over there Lily. If this wasn’t the best school you got accepted to, then obviously you settled. Why the regret or second guessing? All the people, which are few, that I came across who hated USC were those who couldn’t make friends at this school. It wasn’t about high tuition. It was more about loneliness. USC is a big, 20K+ undergrad school. It is hard to fit in. 
This school isn’t for everyone.

When I used to think about studying abroad, the first image that came to my mind was often jet-setting across continents and visiting new cities every weekend. Unlike most people I know (looking at you, friends in Europe), I haven’t known this to be my reality and until last week I hadn’t left New Zealand since I arrived here in early February.
I got the opportunity to visit Thailand as my first international (from New Zealand) trip, and I couldn’t be happier with my time there. I don’t know many people who have visited Thailand so I wasn’t filled with preconceived notions of what to expect when I landed. Any expectations I had would have been completely shattered though, Thailand was beautiful in every way.

From the food to the culture to the beaches, Thailand impressed me and showed me a completely new part of the world. It wasn’t somewhere that had always been at the top of my travel wish list, but it should be at the top of everyone’s list. Thailand has a lot to teach. And though the beaches are the most beautiful part, I learned the most from spending the first few days participating in activities alongside locals.
As if studying abroad isn’t stepping out of your comfort zone enough, I took it a step further and ate rice and noodles three times a day… for 10 days. For those of you who know me, you may know that I don’t like rice. New food was only the beginning of the gateway to a new culture, though it was delicious. 
One night we stayed in village about two hours from Chiang Mai, and while we were there we went to the local river where it was amazing to see the entire village gathered around, partying and enjoying each other’s company. In a town where many of the children have never seen Americans before, it was humbling to see the joy that these children took in playing with the most basic of toys in a river that I consider to be quite filthy.

The next day we got to spend time at an elephant sanctuary in the same area. I know now that riding elephants is extremely detrimental because the parks that have this feature torture the elephants into submission before they can be ridden. As long as tourists are willing to pay though, the problem will continue. At our park, Elephant Nature Park, we were able to walk freely among the gentle giants, feeding and petting them. It was eye-opening to see these rescued animals behave so similarly to the dogs that my family has rescued in the past. Shy at first, but beyond friendly once you’ve earned their trust, the elephants surprised me by each showing a different personality. 
“They can tell if we love them,” one of the locals who works at the park daily said to me. “They want to love us, but they want to be loved first.”

Though he was talking about the elephants, his message really hit home about the purpose of the trip as well. Here I was standing in a country where you can’t even brush your teeth with the tap water because it’s so dirty, but everyone who I came in contact with was extremely kind and friendly, despite the constant language barrier.
Though I haven’t been able to travel to a new country every weekend, or even every month, the time I did get to spend visiting Thailand was long enough for me to think of it as extremely impactful and something that will leave a lasting impression.
I love traveling to see new places, different landscapes and scenes that I would otherwise only see in movies, but this trip in particular struck me in the heart and taught me that traveling isn’t just about seeing a new place — it’s also about seeing, experiencing and loving new people.
What an amazing article.  I have traveled many places but have always shied away from Thailand because of the stories I’d heard.  Well, your story, your perspective, sheds a new light and I have to rethink my previous non visiting stance.  Thanks for sharing.

Fresh off of hard-fought dual victories over Cal Poly and crosstown rival UCLA on Saturday, the No. 1 USC beach volleyball team will look to defend its title as reigning conference champions this weekend when they compete in the second annual Pac-12 Beach Volleyball Championships in Tucson, Ariz.
With the regular season now behind them and a 60-match winning streak in tow, the undefeated Trojans (30-0) will make their first-ever appearance at Bear Down Beach in the tournament, hosted by the University of Arizona, with double-elimination team bracket play beginning on Thursday. The conference will crown a team champion on Friday and then play an 18-pair single-elimination tournament to crown a pairs champion on Saturday.
Two Trojan duos have crossed the 30-win plateau this season, with senior All-Americans and reigning Pac-12 pairs champions Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes boasting a 35-1 overall record this season and a 29-1 mark in dual matches at the top court. At the bottom of the lineup at No. 5, juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer are 30-4 overall with a 26-2 dual record, and they reached the 30-win mark after an exciting three-setter against UCLA on Saturday.
Following right behind is the No. 3 pair of junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin, who own a 28-7 overall record and 25-5 mark in duals together. USC’s No. 2 pair of seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler (17-5 overall, 16-4 duals) and No. 4 pair of sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis (16-5 overall, 15-5 duals) will look to crack the 20-win threshold over the weekend.
The Trojans are eager to defend their conference title in Tucson against largely improved competition from last year, and they hope to finish the season out strong.
“The team is really excited,” Kremer said. “We really want to win another Pac-12 Championship. There is going to be some great competition, and we’ve been waiting all season for these last two tournaments — Pac-12s and NCAAs — so we’re ready for that final push.”
This year’s conference field includes three teams ranked in the AVCA Top 10, with No. 1 USC
(30-0), No. 2 UCLA (26-3) and
No. 8 Arizona (15-8) at the top. Pac-12 rivals Arizona State (12-14), Washington (7-5) and Stanford (12-8) also received votes in this week’s AVCA poll.
In the inaugural Pac-12 Tournament held at Merle Norman Stadium last season, the Trojans picked up 5-0 wins over Oregon and California in the quarterfinals before posting a 3-2 victory over UCLA in the semifinals. USC was then crowned the first-ever league champion with a 3-0 sweep over Arizona in the finals. The Trojans could potentially meet the Bruins and the Wildcats again this weekend in the team bracket, although USC owns a perfect all-time record against both schools.
As the top seed in the team bracket, No. 1 USC will kick off its tournament on Thursday at 1 p.m., taking on the winner of the de facto play-in match between the No. 8 and No. 9 seeds. Should the Trojans advance, the quarterfinal matchup will begin at 6 p.m. The semifinals of the tournament begin on Friday at 9 a.m., with the Pac-12 team title match is scheduled for later in the afternoon at 1 p.m. Finally, the pairs championship will begin on Friday and run until the final at 1 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.

Junior guard Elijah Stewart will remain at USC next season.
The Trojans’ leading 3-point shooter last year, Stewart announced his intention to declare for the 2017 NBA Draft on April 11 but didn’t submit his paperwork by the league’s deadline on Sunday night.
This will come as welcome news to head coach Andy Enfield, who will retain one of his most lethal scorers for the 2017-18 season. Stewart’s 78 3-pointers led the team by more than 30 baskets last year, and he has a chance to break USC’s all-time record for 3-point baskets next season. He currently sits in sixth place — one make short of tying Harold Miner for fifth.
Though Stewart is now out of the pre-draft process, two of his Trojan teammates remain. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright and redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron both submitted their documents, but because they have not hired an agent, they can still withdraw from the draft until May 24.
Stewart will return to a crowded and talented Trojan backcourt, as Duke transfer Derryck Thornton will be eligible next season to complement Stewart, junior guard Jordan McLaughlin and Aaron, should he choose to return as well.

When I first began researching the topic of violence in football for the Daily Trojan’s supplement a month ago, I thought I knew what to expect.
I’ve read the headlines, I’ve seen the statistics. But as I researched, I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the violence that athletics programs, both collegiate and professional, attempt to gloss over to protect their talent.
I love sports. I always have, and I always will. Yet the more that I learn about the darker side of athletics, the more I wonder what we’re getting wrong. I spent the last few weeks looking, and I finally realized that the trait that most commonly protects violent athletes and allows this cycle to continue is rather unexpected — forgiveness.
For me, the most disturbing part of the rhetoric surrounding the issue of sexual assault and violence in athletics is the myth of the “second chance.” We hear it time and time again — an athlete made a mistake, slipped up, got himself in trouble when he was young and stupid and didn’t know any better. Now we’re supposed to believe that he’s taken a turn for the better, that his head and heart is in the right place. We’re supposed to believe that he isn’t a threat anymore.
I do believe in second chances, and third and fourth and fifth chances, but only in circumstances where the possibility of redemption outweighs the atrocity of the past errors. Earlier this month, I binge watched the entirety of the Netflix docuseries Last Chance U, which follows the paths of several young men spending a year playing football at a junior college in Scooba, Miss. after leaving Division I colleges. 
The main subjects of the series are entertaining, passionate and spirited, and it’s hard not to root for them throughout its six episodes. Each of these athletes messed up — some with grades, others with position competition — and is looking for a second chance. These athletes are easy to relate to because their mistakes only hurt themselves, and their only wrongdoings come from not living up to their own potential. They deserve second chances because the weight of their error is carried entirely upon their own shoulders.
But young athletes who commit violent acts don’t deserve that second chance. It’s one thing to truly “mess up,” to fail a class or get drunk and miss practice or even to yell at a coach. It is completely different for an athlete to harm another person, and that can’t be tolerated anymore.
Something has to be done. It’s absurd, preposterous and dangerous to let this go any longer.
I understand the complexities of enforcing this stance. As a fan of the Kansas Jayhawks this year, I was completely shocked to see one of my favorite players, Carlton Bragg, charged with assaulting a woman at a campus apartment building. For a week, I was horrified that this player, who always attacked the court with warmth and a goofy grin, could have hurt a woman.
In Bragg’s investigation, however, security footage revealed that he was completely innocent — the woman who accused him of assaulting her had actually been the one responsible, both verbally and physically attacking Bragg, who attempted to keep her at arm’s length. 
If it weren’t for a conveniently placed video camera, that case could have ended Bragg’s career. And I know that similar situations happen without a camera across the country. Ambiguities occur constantly in situations of assault, particularly when all that is involved is one person’s word against another’s. 
But in the cases of cut-and-dried violence, there is no reason for any exceptions, any forgiveness, any second chances. Take Joe Mixon, who spent a season suspended from Oklahoma after knocking out a girl at a restaurant, or Tyreek Hill, who was kicked out of Oklahoma State after brutally attacking his pregnant girlfriend. These players committed acts that should be unforgivable, yet their futures seem destined for NFL stardom.
At the end of the day, though, what are teams gaining by picking up these athletes? Maybe they can run 4.24-second 40-yard dashes, maybe they can slice through offensive lines like butter. But what is gained by picking up a talented athlete who is also capable of causing harm off the football field?
Sports are, and always have been, about so much more than just winning. Sports are about loyalty, dedication, faith, heart and inspiration. We don’t paint our bodies red and gold, we don’t stand in negative-3-degree snowstorms, we don’t fly halfway across the country and spend hundreds on jerseys and scream at our TVs because of a score.
We do this because of love. For our teams, for our games, for our players — we all do this out of love, whether we are coaches or athletes or fans. There is nothing like a love for sports because it can outlast a lifetime of losing streaks and poor trades and untimely injuries.
There’s no place in that love for violence. And as fans, we must stand strong in this belief to protect the games we love.
Julia Poe is a sophomore studying print and digital journalism. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Poe’s Perspective,” ran on Wednesdays.
The girl who violently assaulted Joe Mixon, and who would not retreat from her violence against him until he struck back, should she also not be forgiven?

Two Trojans were recognized this week with conference honors after dominating performances during the final week of regular season play.
Junior Gabby Smith was named Pac-12 Player of the Week for the third time this year for the women’s tennis team, while women’s lacrosse senior attacker Kylie Drexel earned MPSF Offensive Player of the Week honors for the third time in her career.
Smith, the most decorated Pac-12 women’s tennis player in 2017, earned her fourth career Player of the Week nod for her matches against rival UCLA and Pepperdine. 
Smith and doubles partner, senior Zoë Katz, earned the doubles point against Pepperdine with a 7-6 (6) victory over Luisa Stefani and Ashley Lahey. Though the Trojans would go on to lose 4-3 to the Waves, Smith and Katz’s efforts staked USC an early lead.
In addition to Smith’s doubles performance, the former high school All-American out of Henderson, Nev. earned her 20th and most important singles win on Saturday on court two, where she has bested opponents eight out of nine times this year.
Smith defeated UCLA’s Terri Flemming 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-4 for the second time this season to seal USC’s 4-3 upset of the No. 22 Bruins on the road in Westwood on Saturday.
Smith, the No. 27 player in the nation, will now lead the Trojans into the Pac-12 Championships as the No. 6 seed against
No. 11 seed Washington State on Wednesday.
Smith’s award brings USC level with UCLA and Cal for most Pac-12 Players of the Week this season, with four recipients each. 
Meanwhile on the lacrosse field, Drexel was named the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week for the third time in her career on Monday. Drexel, a
two-time MPSF All-America Second Team selection, earned Player of the Week honors thanks to her game-changing production against Stanford and UC Davis last weekend.
USC traveled to Stanford on Friday, where Drexel exploded for five goals, four assists, three ground balls, two draw controls and a caused turnover in a competitive 15-12 victory. Though senior attacker Michaela Michael tied Drexel for the team lead in goals with five, Drexel’s 9 points and four assists versus the Cardinal were team and career highs.
In USC’s 18-9 regular season finale victory at UC Davis, Drexel was not as potent, but she still managed to score four goals and add an assist, three draw controls and a ground ball to help the Trojans maintain their undefeated 8-0 conference record.
After earning Offensive Player of the Week, Drexel, a former High School First Team US Lacrosse All-American, gives USC its 10th award this season and 33rd award in program history.
With Drexel’s win on Monday, USC has also received an MPSF honor for the sixth straight week. Michael earned four consecutive Offensive Player of the Week nods before her streak was snapped last week, but junior goalie Gussie Johns filled the gap, taking home Defensive Player of the Week last Monday. Freshman midfielders Kerrigan Miller and Kaeli Huff were also named Rookie of the Week earlier this season.
The No. 8 Trojans (14-3, 8-0) are the defending MPSF champions and will host the conference tournament at McAlister Field this week, running from Thursday to Sunday. With the top seed in the tournament, USC will meet either fourth-seeded Oregon or fifth-seeded San Diego State in the first semifinal game at noon on Friday.

LavaLab hosted  Demo Night, where seven student startup groups gathered to pitch product ideas to their peers and a panel of industry professional judges, on Monday evening.
Founded in 2013, LavaLab is USC’s product design incubator that fosters student collaborations. Each semester, students are placed in groups that bring their innovative ideas to reality. From hosting respected innovators as guest speakers to providing classes on how to build a pitch, LavaLab provides opportunities for students to exercise their full creativity.
The event started promptly at 7 p.m., and the seven student startups were given three minutes each to pitch ideas. Consequently, they were required to man booths that showcased their product. These ideas were unique, but each catered toward the needs of college students, from professional networking to essay editing.
The first group, Memoire, focused their project on improving mental health on campus. The product encourages self-reflection and allows users to reflect on their day by asking them short questions through emojis. By digitizing and expediting the journaling process, Memoire provides an incentive for students to express their feelings in a healthy way.
Peerval, the second startup, is an online essay-editing platform that allows students to upload their essays and receive quality feedback from peers who have taken the same class in the past. While there are other essay-editing platforms that already exist, Peerval ensured that students receive helpful feedback at a reasonable price.
Gear Up, the third startup, aimed to address students’ needs for items they would potentially use only once. Gear Up allows students to rent out a variety of items, ranging from outdoor equipment to electronics. The project hoped to create a sustainable network on campus that encourages students to do more, but own less.
Grapevine plays on the popular food delivery services USC students use and combines all major services around Los Angeles to provide the user with relevant delivery information. The app showcased the service with the fastest delivery time and cheapest fees at any given moment. The Grapevine team hoped that their product can help students cut costs on food and allocate their spending toward other student necessities.
In a product that assists USC students with advice about their future professions, Hive connects students with alumni who have graduated with similar majors. The product fosters a mentor-mentee relationship between current students and alumni, who will be able to answer questions students have about their career path while expanding their professional network.
Sweep provides a useful solution for messy computer desktops by promoting a simple and easy way to sort files. This app marks files in the computer by due date and time, and sorts files according to the class or date saved. Sweep also has the ability to position files onto the desktop based on location, making it easier for students to find the files they need for different classes.
The last product, Rhythm, is a wearable technology that strives to help users distance themselves from electronics and social media. The product lets users screen the important notifications they truly need. Using customized vibrations to signify different notifications from different apps or people, Rhythm informs the user of the type of notification they receive without requiring the user to look at any screen.
After half an hour of voting by both the audience and the judges, Peerval was voted the crowd favorite, while Rhythm impressed the judges with a working prototype. 
Liam Maddox, a freshman majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and one of the creators of Rhythm, had nothing but appreciation for the opportunity LavaLab presented his team.
“I think LavaLab presents a really engaging community for its members,” Maddox said. “The relationships you build and the feedback you get from others really is invaluable. For me that meant being supported by my team and being able to reach out for critique and advice from others, which is so important to growing as a student within any discipline.”

Colorful fliers on campus bulletin boards signify Denim Day on Wednesday. Although the colors are vibrant and cheerful, the bold text conveys a serious message: Denim Day seeks to bring conversation to sexual assault, in which participants wear denim to showcase their support for assault victims. 
In an attempt to spark awareness about assault in the microcosm of USC, the USC branch of Not On My Campus, an organization that aims to engage students in conversations about rape culture and sexual abuse, will host a Denim Day campaign on Wednesday. NOMC president and USC Denim Day coordinator Ellie McDaniel recognizes the struggle the University faces in an attempt to better address sexual assault statistics.
“One major factor in keeping us from ending sexual assault is the party culture on this campus,” McDaniel said. “The party culture creates an ecosystem where the goal for both parties involved is to hook up. How it’s expected to happen is both parties drink alcohol to make it ‘more acceptable.’”
McDaniel said that this culture cultivates the idea of sex as a conquest, creating scenarios where consent is overlooked or misunderstood. 
The original Denim Day campaign was founded by the non-profit volunteer organization Peace Over Violence as a response to a controversial Italian Supreme Court ruling in 1999. The ruling dealt with an incident of sexual assault in 1992, in which a Roman driving instructor was accused of raping an 18-year-old female driving student and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about it. 
The victim’s parents agreed to assist her in pressing charges, and the man was convicted of his crimes in the district court system. In 1999, however, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the previous ruling, stating that the alleged rape was in fact consensual because the victim was wearing tight jeans and allegedly assisted the attacker in taking them off. 
“It is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them,” the Court wrote.
The decision sparked instantaneous and passionate reactions across Italy, demanding justice for this gross malfeasance. Members of the Italian Parliament, including Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of Benito Mussolini, displayed their outrage by wearing jeans and protesting inside Parliament. The official Denim Day statement declares, “There is no excuse and never invitation to rape.”
While simply wearing denim on Wednesday will not eradicate sexual assault at USC or anywhere in the world, proponents hope that participation initiates an honest and productive dialogue among students and faculty in the community.
Please act like adults for a change….Please.

The new Netflix original series Girlboss, based on Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso’s autobiography #GIRLBOSS, is a curious shell of a show. Belied by flaws in both subject and substance, it is still fascinating — driven by leading lady Britt Robertson’s riveting performance, Girlboss is the red carpet on which its protagonist Sophia walks. She’s the new brand of female character whom audiences love and everyone inside the series seems to hate: a girl who wears what she wants and does what she wants and, most of all, doesn’t care what you would seem to think.
 The first episode gets off on a rocky start, with two disjointed scenes of Sophia pushing her car out of the path of traffic and then conversing with an old woman in a park about her philosophy of life. But the ball soon gets rolling, although not before one of the most cookie-cutter girl-meets-boy sequences I’ve ever seen. (Unfortunately, I’m still curious why the episode would smash right into cliche after a teaser so tailored to the unique.) Good thing the story that follows feels like a cleanse: It begins with one of those one-night stand scenes that start with two people falling into bed wrapped around each other — right until Sophia stops it in its tracks. She just doesn’t feel like it anymore. What she does feel like, however, is having the man, Shane, make ocean noises in her ear so that she can fall asleep better. And apparently, Shane likes it, too. He falls for Sophia, even if she doesn’t think twice about leaving his room the next morning with the breakfast he prepared for her left uneaten behind her.
Girlboss, as its title promises, is a feminist mantra all the way through, vivacious and bursting with as much life as the colors on its screen. Sophia’s questioning of old wisdom, her unbothered air at having tens of cars honk at her, the conscious decision not to call her boss a bitch: all of it matters, and all of it hits the viewer — whether he or she realizes it. The beauty of Girlboss is that you don’t have to think hard while watching it, but it doesn’t matter: Its message is crafted so cleanly it doesn’t feel like a message at all. Bold feminism: It’s the protagonist, and it’s the world.
Nevertheless, the big brass spine of Girlboss won’t ring with everyone who watches it, and it’s maybe why the series seems to be doing lukewarm in its reception. Simply, not everyone will see Sophia in themselves. And if you don’t, well then, good luck digging your heels into this show.
“Why am I such an asshole?”
It’s a question Sophia asks herself after being fired by her boss for careless behavior. Sure, maybe I’m the opposite of the bubbly, charismatic and fashion-conscious Sophia, but when she walks down the street afterward, tears in her eyes and wondering what the hell is wrong with her, I can’t help but understand. Not from being fired, but from wondering what it is about yourself that seems so out of odds with what people expect.
It’s a fact of womanhood that if you don’t check all the right boxes, then you are perceived as a number of things: morally indecent or lazy or bitchy or selfish. But the thing about Sophia is that her flighty, restless and unrestrainable energy, which sends her barreling through life like no one’s business, is not a choice. It’s not a mask, not an act, not a pose to attract men or appear more charming. It’s just who she is, and what she thinks like, and sometimes it’s so strong it can break her. But for all it’s worth, it’s not going away.
As someone who doesn’t fit directly into the mold society would like women to adhere to, I sympathize. For the life of me I can’t pretend to smile when I’m not happy, pretend to like someone when I don’t, or pretend to do a task I don’t have faith in it. And I won’t fake it till I make it, not for a man and not for anyone. To this extent, I see myself in Sophia, and for that I admire Girlboss. It is unapologetic.
And it’s not like riding high is all that Girlboss is about: As the series’ first episode demonstrates, Sophia’s free-for-all mentality can have devastating consequences — alienating a gruff but loving father (played by Dean Norris, who I can never again imagine as anyone other than Hank Schrader from Breaking Bad).
It’s a heartbreaking scene, but it’s about as emotionally rough as Girlboss is going to get, and that’s a problem that needles into the show from the first episode — the stakes are never truly present. Sophia faces eviction, but somehow avoids that by successfully selling her newly purchased thrift-store cowboy jacket online. Cool — unless further episodes prove this new development to be truly innovative or inspiring, Girlboss has my superficial vote but not my emotional engagement.
A premise that only holds air: It’s neither forgivable nor enough. And maybe Girlboss won’t last, but I’m still glad it’s here. Sometimes, I’m just in the mood to watch easy television about women who don’t care, and for whom rules are just obstacles to smash out of their paths. Dumpster-diving for bagels, stealing carpets, it’s not about lawlessness — it’s about not having a care. When you have no pride, you have no shame, and in Sophia’s world there is nothing — not a father, a boy, a lost job or an eviction notice  —  that can trump her brazen spirit.
AV Club recently took the series to task for Amoruso’s real-life problematic activity: Nasty Gal stole multiple clothing designs, and fired several women who were pregnant. The Girlboss series may be a big long commercial for Amoruso’s #GIRLBOSS book, but how much are we supposed to separate it from each other (Amoruso, it is important to note, serves as an executive producer for the show)? That is a question only the viewer can answer for herself.
As for me, I think about all of these things. But I also keep thinking about the scene in Girlboss’ first episode where Sophia comes home from a heartbreaking dinner with her father, only to rediscover an eviction notice taped to her door. She’s spent a day eating bagels out of dumpsters and stealing a carpet, but instead of moping she goes inside, pegs the carpet to a wall and begins taking pictures of herself in front of her new backdrop.
It’s a ploy to sell the jacket she’s wearing, of course, and it’s a choice that will jumpstart her career in internet commerce. But for now, staring boldly into the camera, it is a reminder of Girlboss’ inescapable message: When you have nothing, at least you still have yourself.

I’ll be the first to admit that countless college students have absolutely no concept of money. In my three years at USC, I’ve seen students act recklessly with their allowances from their parents. As someone who has juggled work and school since the first semester of my freshman year, I’m consistently appalled to see students who have never worked a paying job in their lives dropping other people’s money on lavish spring breaks and expensive nights out, while acting surprised that other students cannot afford to hang out with them. 
That may be more of a lesson in ignorance than in money management, but nevertheless, increased information regarding personal finance is needed for students of all socioeconomic levels. However, students will still blow off a required money management class. Instead of forcing students to sit in boring lectures full of generic information that might or might not apply to them, USC should offer more personalized finance resources to students, allowing students to access the information and support they need when they need it. 
In addition to basic money management, there is also the larger issue of student debt, which over 44 million borrowers in the United States face. The average U.S. college student in the graduating Class of 2016 left school with over $37,000 in debt.  With students taking out loans amounting to thousands of dollars at as young as 17 years old, there undoubtedly is a need for resources to help these students figure out exactly what they’re getting into. This has rightfully caused many to call for required college courses in money management in order to teach students about fiscal responsibility. While this is undoubtedly an important lesson, a class isn’t the best format to present it in. 
Instead of formal classes, USC could model resources on one of several existing formats. For example, the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government currently provide free legal aid to students. Students currently have access to free 30-minute legal consultation to ask their own specific questions. A similar system could work with financial assistance — USC could offer free financial advisers for students to make appointments with and discuss financial issues, such as the decision to work during the school year or take out a loan or budget creation. 
In addition to in-person services, USC could also follow the example of the Career Center’s Online Resources page. The website hosts any piece of information a student could want regarding careers, all in one place. If I was forced to take a class on how to write a cover letter, I might forget the specifics or not even pay attention to begin with. However, if I’m in the middle of a cover letter that’s due the next day and get stuck on the intro, I can use the Career Center’s online resources to access specific recommendations. 
Many students already complain about general education classes, and for many students — including myself — these classes are on the bottom of the totem pole of priorities. Of course, the same could be said about the financial advisers or online resources: students might just choose not to access them. However, at least the information is there if students need it. 
And some students might not need any information on money management. USC boasts a diverse student body, and attempting to broadly categorize their financial knowledge to squeeze into a single course syllabus would be nearly impossible. Plenty of students at USC have experience with personal finance, have been working for years, pay their own bills or even help out their parents with finances. Putting them through a money management course would be unnecessary, and ironically, a waste of their time and money. 
Staffing a resource center with financial advisers or peer mentors would allow students to get the financial help they need, when they need it, instead of wasting their tuition money on another class.

A big part of the problem is confused employers who feel you only need a high school diploma to work at a nuclear power plant but you need a college degree to serve coffee.
I see Erin Rode is currently a junior majoring in print and digital journalism and political science.  We’ll just wait and see how responsible a money manager she thinks she is when that first bill comes due that she can’t afford to pay.
You see.  The problem isn’t the students.  Although many colleges, lenders, governments, judges, lawyers, debt collectors, the department of education and other sketchy criminals involved in the scam often believe the solution to convincing students they’ll never amount to anything without a college degree, robbing them blind, loading them up with debt they know no one could ever afford to repay and leaving them high and dry as a homeless person is to then turn around and blame the students for being irresponsible money managers.  Let’s face it, everyone will believe them because the students are just deadbeats with “no concept of money” who don’t want to pay the bills, right?!?
Once the relationship between her and her mafia-run scam school has been ruined and they file that first lawsuit and play their games of trickery and treachery to obtain default judgement (“Oops!!  We forgot to tell you to show up or we paid someone to tell you not to show up. Hate when that happens.”) she’ll sever all ties without even batting an eyelash and never look back.  If you really know what’s best for you, you won’t even get involved.  She’ll certainly need that degree in political science because experience is always a better teacher than any classroom will ever be.  Burn me once shame on you, burn me twice shame on me.
In any case have fun!!  You’re well on your way to homelessness.  Enjoy!  I’m sure you will because you can do anything you want when you’re homeless and no one cares because you’re a crazy homeless person.  If you end up in prison for killing a man that’s a bonus…free food and a free place to stay courtesy of taxpayers everywhere.  PRO TIP:  target the shady characters mentioned in the second paragraph if you need free food and a place to stay because you can’t afford to live anywhere else other than a cardboard box.  It’ll be well worth it to see them suffer as much as you have.

As I near the end of my final year at USC, I think it is appropriate to reflect on my time here and consider what might be done to improve the University. Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is the general education curriculum, which undergraduate students must engage in. At USC, general education courses are commonly seen by students as incredibly valuable, an unbelievable waste of time or anywhere in between. This often occurs because students feel like the general education courses they are more or less forced to take often do not correlate with their interests or with their future careers. While I enjoyed nearly every general education class I had the opportunity to take, it is still clear that the University may be able to improve the perception of the general education program by including a topic of universal importance that has so far been lacking coverage: money.
There are certainly many students who have learned how to manage their wealth responsibly, either before or during their time on campus. Particularly prudent students may craft budgets and stick to self-imposed limits on spending money. Others, however, clearly do not. In recognition of the fact that many students may not learn to appropriately handle money early in their collegiate careers, a class teaching fiscal responsibility would be appropriate to include in the general education curriculum. 
General education courses serve a very important role in rounding out undergraduate education, making students literate in more fields of study than solely their chosen majors. Classes in history, language, mathematics science and philosophy all advance the excellent liberal arts education that makes universities like USC so prestigious and competitive. This educational curriculum is central to the University’s goal of creating well-prepared and studious thinkers, artists and entrepreneurs. However, fiscal responsibility universally applies to nearly all aspects of student life, yet gets comparatively little official attention. If students are to become responsible members of society upon graduation, this must change.
This proposed money management class could feasibly be made into a one or two-unit course with minimal busywork but still teaches the essentials of fiscal responsibility to younger students. This would concurrently accomplish two major goals: maximizing the utility of the course while also minimizing the burden on students whose majors force them to take substantial class loads in their first few semesters. Furthermore, the class could be made subject to a placement exam, similar to how foreign language courses are currently handled in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Under this model, if a student demonstrates that they already have the necessary financial management skills, they would not need to take the course. 
In this way, the course would not be a waste of time and money, but instead would be an investment in the futures of future Trojans and the University itself. Current career and financial resources offered at USC, like those at the Career Center and the Financial Aid Office, are certainly helpful and welcome. But the fact is that many Trojans, even those that have family wealth to fall back on, can be irresponsible when it comes to personal finance. The quicker those students can learn how to use their money properly, the better for all Trojans, especially themselves.
One may make the argument that these are skills that students should teach themselves or should pick up over time, and there is merit to that point of view. In an ideal world, teaching young adults enrolled in college how to handle their financial assets would not be necessary. Money management skills and financial responsibility are topics that really should be taught in more elementary tiers of education than at a university. Yet, here we are. 
When students impose financial goals and schedules upon themselves that are detrimental to their health and academic performance, one is left to wonder if plain ignorance is the root cause. It may or may not be. At the very least, USC can do its part to invest in the futures of Trojans by showing them the right way to handle money, even if they ultimately choose not to follow sage advice. At least then we will know that it was the student’s informed choice to do so.
USC has the unique opportunity to position itself as the premier guide to student financial responsibility, even if students have an excess of wealth (and especially if they do not). For this reason, the University should consider adding a course on money management to the general education curriculum.

Former USC linebacker Lamar Dawson’s class-action wage lawsuit against the Pac-12 and NCAA was dismissed by a federal judge on Tuesday who said the case was based on “untenable legal theory,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
Dawson, who played football for USC from 2011 to 2015, claimed that the Pac-12 and NCAA violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the California Labor Code because they do not pay football players minimum wage or overtime, according to the Los Angeles Times. He sued in U.S. District Court in San Francisco in September. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg refuted Dawson’s argument in a 12-page opinion, which stated that “there is simply no legal basis for finding [collegiate athletes] to be ‘employees’ under the FLSA.”
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the FLSA establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping and child labor standards affecting full- and part-time workers in the private sector and in federal, state and local governments.
While Dawson argued that collegiate football players should be considered employees because football is a revenue-generating sport, Seeborg wrote that “the premise that revenue generation is determinative of employment status is not supported by the case law.”
Donald Remy, the NCAA’s chief legal officer, supported Judge Seeborg decision in a statement.
“As we have said in this case and others before it, there is no legal support for the idea that college athletics participation makes a student a university employee,” the statement said. “Playing college sports allows students to get a quality education and build skills to prepare them for success after college. It is unfortunate we must continue to expend resources on cases that copy previously dismissed lawsuits.” 
Dawson was a starter linebacker for USC as a true freshman in 2011, but a torn ACL and other subsequent injuries affected his career and his chance of playing in the NFL, according to ESPN. He redshirted in 2014 and appeared in eight games in 2015, when he finished with 31 tackles.

With final exams fast approaching, the Engemann Student Health Center is ready for a surge in the demand for mental health services. Kelly Greco, a staff psychologist and the assistant director of outreach and prevention services, said many students become overwhelmed toward the end of the school year.
“Around this time, right before finals and graduation, you sometimes see an increase in services [needed],” Greco said. “We do our best in terms of keeping up with that.”
Mental health issues are increasingly common among college students. A 2015 report by the Center for Collegiate Health at Penn State University — which collected data from 139 colleges — found “slow but consistent growth” over the past five years in the number of students experiencing depression, anxiety and social anxiety. The report also found that over the last five years, the demand for counseling services has been “dramatically outpacing” the rate of school enrollment.
Greco said she can see why individuals struggle psychologically during their college years.
“I think at this stage of development, it’s difficult because you’re trying to find your way and trying to find what you like and what you want to do with your career,” Greco said. “You might be feeling expectations that you’re putting on yourself or that you get from others … how you respond to that plays a role in your stress.”
For USC students, Engemann provides a range of services including individual counseling, group counseling, crisis services and stress management workshops. A student seeking counseling can call or go online to make an appointment for a phone consultation with a counselor. According to Greco, a consultation is scheduled within 48 hours of the student reaching out. During the phone appointment, the counselor assesses the student’s needs and provides recommendations for treatment.
Alternatively, students can call to schedule an appointment in case of a crisis. Engemann also offers a 24-hour hotline that students can call for emergencies outside of regular hours. Greco says Engemann makes it a priority to accommodate students quickly.
“It’s like any other doctor’s office — walk-ins are a first-come, first-serve type thing,” Greco said. “But there are always clinicians on the front line that are handling the walk-ins every single day.”
Sasha, a senior studying political science who declined to use her last name for privacy reasons, uses walk-in appointments when she wants a more knowledgeable and professional outlook on a problem she’s facing.
“I feel like when you talk with your friends, oftentimes, they only have their own perspectives to share,” Sasha said. “But when you go to Engemann, you have resources to help you.”
From her experiences, Sasha believes that Engemann counselors are equipped to deal with a variety of issues.
“I’ve gone for relationship things, I’ve gone for test anxiety,” Sasha said. “They really are just there to help with whatever the student needs.”
Although Engemann does have staff psychiatrists who provide short-term care, students who have more severe symptoms and require ongoing psychiatric treatment are referred to external mental health professionals.
“If [the student] is deemed as being appropriate for brief, short-term psychotherapy, they would see a clinician and see the psychiatrist here for a short term,” Greco said. “If someone needs ongoing care, we help them get connected with someone in the community.”
While Greco said that Engemann makes an effort to refer students to doctors who are nearby and covered by Aetna student health insurance, it may still be difficult for some students to make time for and travel to sessions off-campus. Sasha thinks that long-term counseling with resident psychiatrists would be a good addition to the services currently provided.
“Something they could offer is long term services so [students] can stay with a therapist or psychiatrist for longer than a semester,” Sasha said.

Undergraduate Student Government passed a budget proposal that will decrease funding for two Student Affairs programming departments and increase the USC Concerts Committee budget at the USG meeting on Tuesday. 
This is a revised version of the plan proposed at last week’s Senate meeting, in which Treasurer Donielle Bunyard proposed that the Volunteer Center and the Leadership, Education and Development program will receive no funding from USG. 
“Last week, we presented zero dollars to all of Student Affairs, and obviously we had some backlash from that,” USG President Austin Dunn said. “In response to that, we sat down and re-evaluated.” 
The new budget plan will allocate $15,000 to the Volunteer Center and $10,000 to the Leadership, Education and Development program. Last year, they received $73,250 and $19,000 from USG, respectively. 
Though the budget for USC Concerts Committee showed an increase, Dunn said it actually reflected a decrease  because the budget does not account for exceptional funds.
According to Dunn, exceptional funds are USG funds from previous years that are used for the following year. Because USG no longer has exceptional funds to pull from, the total budget from USC Concerts Committee decreased from $600,000 to $400,000. 
Previously, the Volunteer Center and the Leadership, Education and Development program were funded by the mandatory student programming fee that all students pay each semester. Dunn said that USG decided to decrease the funding of these two programs in an effort to increase the fairness of the student programming fee because not all students participated in them. 
“The problem with the L.E.A.D. Programs is that the cost per head is too much,” Dunn said. “One particular example was a retreat for 30 students that was $30,000. Although we totally support leadership development and these retreats, it’s just a lot of money for a small amount of students that all students end up paying for.”
Similarly, Dunn said the Volunteer Center received a decrease in funding because previous USG funds  subsidized Alternative Breaks — an opportunity not all USC students experience. 
“You could take a student, for example, who can’t afford Alternative Breaks but still have to contribute, through the student programming fee, to this program,” Dunn said. “So we tried to increase accessibility to the student programming fee to all students.” 
Dunn stressed that although these two programs will be receiving less funding from USG, the lack of funding will not cause them to be dissolved entirely. According to Dunn, there is a high chance that the campus activities budget within Student Affairs can be reallocated to accommodate the Volunteer Center and the Leadership, Education and Development program. 
“Never was their any intention, in any way, shape or form, to cut volunteer opportunities,” Dunn said. “We totally stand behind leadership development and volunteer and service opportunities on this campus, but it’s just a call to action for the administration to possibly look to financially support them.”

USC may soon take another step forward in its efforts to create a more environmentally sustainable campus. 
On Thursday, the USC Academic Senate will host a forum on  USC’s Sustainability Strategy 2030, building upon the Sustainability 2020 plan that passed last year while identifying new targets for the University. 
The Sustainability Strategy 2030 was created by 12 subject matter experts and was reviewed by three faculty experts across campus. Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously to endorse the plan at the meeting two weeks ago, and will now move on to the next phase for approval. 
In 2014, USC’s self-assessment of its sustainability practices placed it below 21 peer institutions, according to the Association for Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, an international organization that measures sustainability efforts among universities. The University then created the Sustainability 2020 plan to focus on seven main areas to improve sustainability.
According to the text of the proposal drafted by the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee Taskforce, the 2030 Plan builds off of the 2020 plan in efforts to build a more long-term vision of campus environmentalism.
“The 2020 plan is a valuable first step in coordinating our efforts,” the proposal said. “To fulfill USC’s declared ambition, we need a sustained commitment to becoming a leader in the environmental sustainability arena. This should be guided by a longer-term vision and strategy.”
Darren Ruddell, the chair of the Academic Senate Sustainability Committee, said that the plan makes sustainability a priority at USC, as it would work to increase staff sizes to work in this area.
“Right now, there’s a staff size of one to help advance sustainability at USC,” Ruddell said. “What we’re asking for is to increase that staff size to help advance sustainability at USC to help achieve some of these goals we have identified. We want to make a bigger and bolder, more ambitious plan.”
According to Sen. Noah Silver, the Sustainability Strategy 2030 will work to make USC a leader in sustainability.
“It’s a complete overhaul of the entire system,” Silver said. “It totally restructures the system and promotes sustainability in everything that USC does.”
According to Olivia Pearson, the incoming executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, the 2030 plan not only aids USC in improving its own community, but also contributes to promoting sustainability in the surrounding Southern California region. 
“One of the things that’s going to help the L.A. community is that one of the 2030 plans is to get more locally sourced food, so it’s much more sustainable within our community and promotes our local agriculture,” Pearson said.
The taskforce that developed the proposal aims to include an environmental literacy general education requirement for all USC students, develop energy efficiency standards for all new campus buildings and residences and implement annual waste audits. Ruddell said that this gives USC numerous chances to work with local partners. 
“One of the domains is engagement with the community, so USC could very much be a leader in terms of conducting research [and] working with our neighborhoods,” Ruddell said. “There’s so much opportunity right now to partner with Mayor Eric Garcetti, who has been very outspoken in terms of making Los Angeles more resilient. There’s a potential for a great partnership between the city of Los Angeles and USC in terms of pursuing a more ambitious sustainability agenda.”
Yannick Matia, a member of USC’s Environmental Core and a sophomore majoring in political economy and environmental studies, said that passing the Sustainability Strategy 2030 is the first step toward transitioning USC into a fully sustainable campus.
“2030 isn’t just an end all, be all plan to bring sustainability to campus,” Matia said. “We want to expand it further and further along, so we hope to work with faculty, staff and administration in realizing the goals of [the] 2020 [plan] and [the] 2030 [plan].”
The Environmental Student Assembly and the USC Academic Senate will host a forum on the future of sustainability on campus on Thursday at noon in TCC 450.
Correction: The previous headline for this article “Academic Senate to vote on Sustainability 2030 plan” incorrectly stated the Senate will bring the proposal to a vote. The headline has now been updated to reflect the Senate hosting the forum. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
