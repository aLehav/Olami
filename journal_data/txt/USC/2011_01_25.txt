President Obama outlined his plan to prepare America for the future in his second State of the Union Address Tuesday night.
Obama conceded that the future would present challenges for America, but that Americans should embrace these challenges.
“The world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us,” Obama said. “It should challenge us.”
The first part of the President’s plan for the future is centered on education.

Obama called for parents to pay a more integral role in their children’s education.
“We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair; that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline,” Obama said.
A key component of Obama’s education plan is the replacement of the No Child Left Behind Act with a policy that focuses more on children at a local level.
Obama called Race to the Top, a program that awards schools with the highest quality teachers and student achievement, “the most meaningful education reform of the last century.”
The President promised that by the end of this decade, America will once again have the largest proportion of college graduates in the world through increased financial assistance from the government.
Obama also announced that the children of illegal immigrants studying at American universities and colleges should not be deported.
“[Children of illegal immigrants in college] grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet live every day with the threat of deportation,” Obama said. “Let’s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who can staff our research labs, start new businesses and further enrich this nation.”
The second part of Obama’s plan to prepare America for the future is tackling the nation’s rising debt.
“Every day Americans sacrifice to live within their means,” Obama said. “They deserve a government that does the same.”
The President proposed a plan that would freeze all non-security related, domestic spending for the next five years, which would eliminate the deficit by $400 billion in the next 10 years.
In addition Obama promised to restructure the federal government as a cost saving measure.
“We live and do business in the information age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV,” Obama said. “In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.”
The President also pushed a new clean-energy agenda, which calls for America to have the most electric cars on the road of any country by 2050 and to have 85 percent of America’s electricity come from clean energy sources by 2035.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics held a discussion panel in the Annenberg East Lobby prior to the State of the Union Address to discuss cooperation throughout the federal government.
Kate Mather, a panelist at the discussion and former editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, talked about how Obama’s move to the center is crucial for his re-election bid.
“Because Republicans were so successful in November, Obama was forced to move back to the middle,” Mather said. “He does have to start thinking about re-election, so he has to walk a balancing act, but at the same time he needs to also reach out to Republicans.”
Republicans, including Alexandra Russo, president of USC College Republicans, saw Obama’s shift to the center as a political ploy.
“A lot of [Obama’s] points were aimed more at moving his character to the center in light of his upcoming re-election,” Russo said. “He spoke about issues that are typically considered conservative such as cutting federal spending and restructuring federal government, in order to appeal to independent voters.”
Victoria Hallebo, an officer in USC College Democrats, also observed Obama’s shift to the center, but supported his proposed education and infrastructure policies.
“His speech was pretty central,” Hallebo said. “But I agree with his focus on education and infrastructure through technology and innovation.”
Madeline Lansky, a sophomore majoring in political science, applauded Obama’s new education policy and efforts to eliminate earmark spending.
“I like that he took bold stands and I agree with what [Obama] said about education starting in the home,” Lanksy said. “I also am happy [Obama] took a stance against earmarks, he’s extending an olive branch to Republicans.”
Correction: 1/26/11: A previous version of this story identified Kate Mather’s quote as “He does have to start thinking about re-election, so he has to walk a balancing act, but at the same time he needs to also walk out to Republicans.” Mather actually said Obama has to “reach,” not “walk” out to Republicans. This version of the story has been corrected to reflect the change. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The Graduate and Professional Student Senate is implementing a new pre-selection process to streamline the voting process during the 2011-2012 executive board elections.
If there are more than three candidates running for a position, a pre-selection committee made up of three or four current senators or executive board members will screen and interview the candidates before the election and vote to reduce the number of candidates to three.
Those three will then be able to present themselves to the senate during the election.
“Two years ago, there were 10 candidates running for one position and the election meeting took more than four hours,” said Irfan Fazal, GPSS Elections and Recruitment Director. “We created this new policy to formalize the process and to make it more efficient.”
GPSS consists of 72 to 75 senators and an 11-member executive board, which is elected by the senate.
To begin the election process, interested and eligible graduate and professional students need to fill out an “intent to run” form online, which is due Friday.
In the past, the elections would take place in mid-April.
This year, elections are set for early March so that the newly elected executive board will have more time to adjust to their positions.
“Now that elections are pushed up a bit this year, the newly elected executive board will have an appropriate transition time, a time to talk to current executive board members and get settled in,” Fazal said. “This was lacking in the past.”
To run for a position on the executive board, a student must have at least one semester’s experience as part of the executive board, as a senator or a proxy senator, as a committee member or as an executive board member of another USC-recognized club or organization.
“You have to have shown some previous leadership on campus to run [for the executive board],” said GPSS President Jenny Novak.
Because the senate only meets on the last Monday of every month, they will not convene until Feb. 28, when, along with a regular senate meeting, the candidates running for the executive board will participate in a meet-and-greet event.
This meet-and-greet is a chance for the candidates to ask current senators and executive board members questions and for the current senators to get to know the candidates.
Before and after the meet-and-greet, the candidates are responsible for their own campaigning, including making fliers, videos and sending mail to the graduate student population and to the current senators.
On March 7, there will be a special senate meeting where the candidates for each executive board position will have two minutes to speak to the senate.
After, they will participate in a question-and-answer session with the senate, talking about their platforms and goals as a future executive board member.
Some popular platform issues include promoting sustainability on USC’s University Park Campus, engaging and advocating for online graduate students who want to be involved in GPSS and voicing graduate students’ opinions concerning the Health Sciences Campus renovations.
After candidates present their platforms to the senate, the senate then votes for the candidates to occupy the 11 executive board positions.
As the election process begins at the end of this week, Fazal and the whole GPSS encourage eligible students to consider running for office.
“If you’re interested in running, contact current executive board members in the division you find most exciting and they will give you great advice and information,” Novak said.

Coming off a successful weekend doubleheader against Sacramento State and St. Mary’s College, the No. 2 USC men’s tennis team will now face a top-30 team in Florida State.
Attention will shift toward freshmen Emilio Gomez, Michael Grant and Ray Sarmiento to help influence the outcome of the match.
Welcome back · Junior Steve Johnson returns to the court after missing matches against Sacramento State and Saint Mary’s over the weekend because of an injury. Johnson is ranked as the No. 6 singles player in the nation. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
All three had solid finishes to Saturday’s competition and they will need to continue to step up to the plate as the season progresses.
“They have an opportunity to be a big part of the team,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “The freshmen had a great weekend. They came through with flying colors.”
The Trojans (2-0) hope to focus on tightening up in the doubles department, which will be especially important as the season progresses.
Still, if the Trojans give the same effort as last weekend, their prospects of winning look good, especially with the return of some of their more seasoned players.
Returning to the lineup for the match against Florida State (4-0, 2-0) is USC’s No. 1 player, and nationally ranked No. 6, junior Steve Johnson.
Johnson sat out during the weekend’s matches due to injury, but Smith is confident that he will be at 100 percent in the next game.
Last season, Florida State ranked seventh in the ACC conference.
The Seminoles are now No. 27 nationally.
“I think playing the defending national champions is exciting, especially early in the year,” said Florida State assistant coach Nick Crowell on the team website. “Our guys are really excited, they’re really pumped, they worked hard over break. I feel like they’ve had this match in their sights for a long time.”
The Seminoles will return two seniors in Clint Bowles and Vahid Mirzadeh, but the team will rely on the younger talents of freshman Blake Davis and sophomore Connor Smith, who went 5-1 and 6-1 in spring singles dual matches, respectively.
“Florida State is a good program that has been right there in the top 20,” Smith said. “That’s why we are playing them. I am looking forward to seeing how our team plays.”
First serve is at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium.

With just two minutes remaining in USC’s 65-42 drubbing of Stanford on Thursday night, junior walk-on guard Eric Strangis stepped on to the Galen Center court for the first time in his collegiate career.
The entrance lacked the typical Hollywood-esque feel you’d assume would accompany a young man’s final fulfillment of an improbable dream.
There were no raucous chants or thunderous ovations from those still in attendance.
No teammate lobbied for USC coach Kevin O’Neill to play the junior-college transfer more minutes à la the movie Rudy.
My guess is that from the opposing bench, to the few loyal souls still remaining in the student section, Strangis’ appearance on the court went largely unnoticed.
But if ever there was a journey in amateur sports that personified the rarest kind of persistence and optimism, it’s the one told from the heart of the Trojans’ No. 20.
The life of a walk-on athlete is typically not the stuff of legends. The same long hours that future professional athletes dedicate at the collegiate level still apply whether you are a starter or a third-stringer whose only exploits come by way of filling water cups or slapping high fives in the layup lines.
A sane person likely would laugh at that job description, admit his or her finest athletic days are gone and slowly migrate into the university’s intramural leagues.
For Strangis, walking on to a Division-I program didn’t seem like social purgatory or an athletic death sentence, but instead an opportunity to be a part of something that people search for their entire lives.
“Being a part of a team like this is more than I could have asked for,” Strangis said. “I came in with no expectations, but now I have been given the chance to be part of something that is bigger than myself.”
If anything though, the chance was earned, not given.
For most students, the transition to USC is defined by going Greek, searching for a suitable on-campus organization or, if all else fails, watching reruns of favorite movies on Netflix.
When the 6-foot-4, 190-pound guard came to the university back in August, he did the one thing that had come naturally to him his entire life: basketball.
Through his connections with a trainer in the athletic department, Strangis began competing in offseason scrimmages with members of the USC basketball team.
“As soon as school started, I just started hanging around the gym all the time,” Strangis said. “I started talking to some of the coaches, and from there it all just started to happen.”
Strangis started to really assert himself in scrimmages, workouts and conditioning sessions, but the one man who had yet to see the native of La Crescenta, Calif. was O’Neill.
But Strangis, the grandson of former USC track star Sam Nicholson, was undeterred by the fact that he had still yet to meet the Trojans’ coach.
When even the most patient of players likely would have called it quits, the former guard at Moorepark College and Cal Lutheran failed to give in to what seemed like an exercise in futility.
“The funny thing is it never formally happened, believe it or not,” Strangis said with a smile. “It’s crazy even to me. I was told that [the USC coaching staff] thought I could walk on, but there was a chance they wouldn’t open up any spots.”
Although Strangis wasn’t guaranteed a spot even when the team opened up season workouts on Oct. 15, the junior left it all on the practice court, as if he had nothing to lose.
And frankly, if the pursuit of the dream had ended before USC opened their 2010-2011 campaign on Nov. 13 against UC Irvine, no one would have faulted him for coming up just short.
But eight days after his first practice with the team, Strangis was informed by O’Neill he would be playing in the annual Cardinal and Gold scrimmage.
Although zero points and one rebound during his 14 minutes of playing time during the scrimmage isn’t the type of idealistic dream-come-true moment Disney likely engraved into your subconscious, the light at the end of the tunnel was finally in view for Strangis.
Including his stint last week against Stanford, Strangis has played a total of seven minutes this season, while logging two personal fouls.
But if this absurd tale of pipe-dream-turned-reality teaches us anything, it’s that the junior guard isn’t infatuated by statistical accomplishments or glorified attention.
“It’s a mentality that you have to have because we practice more than we play,” Strangis said. “You’re not really having expectations of playing in the games. You just want to do whatever you can to help the team win.”
Strangis will never play professional basketball. It is a fact he knows just as well as you and I.
But sometimes it takes an athlete who continues to compete as if he has nothing to lose to reaffirm that at its core, sports still promote the selfless, steadfast devotion and unjaded ability to dream.

Off to its best start since 1995, the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team looks to continue its dominance on the road at UC Santa Barbara.
The Trojans are led by senior opposite and co-captain Murphy Troy, who was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association National Player of the Week on Monday.
Tough environment · Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and USC will be forced to contend with a raucous crowd Wednesday night. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
This is the fourth time Troy has won the award, and he is the eighth Trojan men’s volleyball player to win it.
Troy leads the team in kills per set (4.31), points per set (4.96) and is tied for the team lead in digs per set (2.00).
“It’s a great honor, especially with so many great players around,” Troy said. “I was really surprised to get it. They could have given it to three or four other players from our team, which really speaks to how well we’re playing right now.”
USC (4-0, 4-0) has managed to win with relative ease during the first two games of their five-game road swing, though the team is still looking to improve passing the ball in order to give their hitters more opportunities to attack.
Against UC Irvine on Friday, the Trojans exhibited their ability to side out, closing the match with a 94 percent success rate.
“A trend that we’ve been showing is that we’ve been starting to side out at the end of matches at a very steady pace,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “If we continue to close out, good things are going to happen for us.”
Defensively, the Trojans are leading the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in digs by a large margin, averaging 10.5 digs per set and outdigging their opponents by an average of three digs per set.
The next highest in the league is 8.8 digs per set.
“We’re converting digs into kills at a .250 quote. We’re doing a good job,” Ferguson said. “The amount of digs that we turn into kills demoralizes the opposing team because it makes them work so hard.”
Statistically, USC’s blocking appears to be less-than-solid, but it is still effective.
“I would like more blocking, but we’re still making other teams hit very low percentages,” Ferguson said. “It’s like a defensive line pressuring a quarterback — even if they don’t get a ton of sacks, altering their attack is still very effective.”
UCSB is led by opposite hitter Cullen Irons and outside hitter Jeff Menzel, who lead the Gauchos in kills with 86 and 84 respectively.
“Irons is a big opposite hitter for them with a big block,” Ferguson said. “He’s going to be blocking against all of our outside hitters, which should be interesting.”
The last Trojans’ trip to Santa Barbara, Calif. ended with a tight five-set victory.
This time around, Ferguson has stressed an improved passing attack as the most important factor for the upcoming match.
“We’re passing well enough, but we need to pass better,” Ferguson said. “[Senior middle blocker]Austin Zahn only had seven attempts and [junior middle blocker]Steven Shandrick only had eight. It would be ideal to have them in double digit attempts. They’re two of the best in the country.”
The Gauchos, although unranked, present the Trojans a unique and valuable opportunity to test their mettle in a hostile environment.
“They’re a very physical team just like us, with a lot of juniors and seniors,” Troy said. “It’s one of our biggest matches of the year. It’ll be a really good test for us, and we’re preparing for a competitive match in one of the toughest places to play.”
First serve is at UC Santa Barbara’s Robertson Gymnasium at 7 p.m.

USC coach Kevin O’Neill gave freshman guard Bryce Jones the option of transferring or facing dismissal from the team after separate incidents with a teammate and a residential adviser, according to a story in the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday.
New information · A report released recently in the Los Angeles Times claims that former freshman guard Bryce Jones struck freshman Garrett Jackson in the face and assaulted a residential adviser. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Jones allegedly hit freshman forward Garrett Jackson early in the school year, fracturing his nose and forcing Jackson to miss the team’s scrimmage, as well as multiple practices.
Jones also was said to have had a confrontation with a resident adviser in his dormitory, according to the Times.
The report contrasts USC’s official release last week that announced Jones’ decision to transfer, citing playing time as one of the reasons he was leaving.
Jones’ stepfather K.C. Jones, however, told the Times he was unaware of the alleged locker room incident regarding Jackson, while also denying that Jones was told to either transfer or be dismissed.
“It would have been torture for him to play out the year with a coach he wasn’t happy with,” the elder Jones told the Times.
K.C. Jones, instead, insisted that Bryce Jones was simply disappointed after O’Neill had allegedly promised Jones during the recruiting process that he would play at least 30 minutes a game.
Jones averaged 7.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in 18 games, including 10 starts before announcing his decision to transfer.
He was second on the team in three-point baskets made and steals.
Jones had an immediate impact on the team, playing 29 or more minutes in six of his first eight collegiate games.
Once junior guard Fontan became eligible, however, Jones saw his playing time decrease significantly. In home games against Washington and Washington State, he played a combined seven minutes. In road games at Oregon and Oregon State, he was only on the court for 14 minutes.
In his absence, Jackson, along with senior guard Donte Smith, have seen more minutes off the bench.
“It’s a good opportunity for Garrett [Jackson], and something we are going to have to adjust to,” Fontan said.
The Trojans are 1-1 since Jones’ announcement, splitting the weekend series with Stanford and California.
O’Neill did not comment on the report.
“It is not really a distraction,” Fontan said at practice Tuesday about the allegations becoming public. “As a team, we do not pay too much attention to it.”
Last week, O’Neill said he was disappointed he couldn’t meet Jones’ needs as a coach.
“We appreciate his contributions to our program, and we wish Bryce and his family all the best,” O’Neill said in a statement released on the team’s website. He’s a talented player with a promising future.”

A Noise Within’s production of the ever-popular farce Noises Off combined with its Glendale location make for quite an enjoyable outing.
Right next to the theater is the Glendale Galleria and the Americana at Brand, home to cafés, restaurants, clothing stores, bookstores and everything you can imagine. If you’re looking to do something this weekend, grab a bite to eat, shop a little and catch a great and hilarious show.
As a repertory theatre, A Noise Within focuses on performing classical dramatic literature, and for this season it has chosen the timeless British farce Noises Off.
Noises Off is a play about a play. The show “Nothing’s On” is to be performed that night when disaster strikes. People are forgetting their lines, an actor is missing, the personal lives of the actors are interfering with the production and everything just seems to be going wrong.
The show is split into three acts. The first introduces the show and the actors, the second occurs during the actual show and the third presents another performance of the show.
Between each of these acts, the set is rotated 180 degrees, and during the second act the audience gets to see what happens behind the scenes.
The set was definitely one of this show’s strengths. Its two stories are decorated to resemble an old English home and it is built in two parts and completely movable, to execute the set change between the acts. Those who stuck around during the intermission got to see the impressive transformation.
To add to the experience, the actors performed the second act in almost complete silence, and making the backstage drama come alive with pantomime while the implied “show” goes on behind the background. It was a very physical show, and the actors pulled it off flawlessly.
The thrust stage had audiences on three sides, and the actors did a great job of playing to all of that. A Noise Within’s greatest strength was assembling a true ensemble in which each actor shined.
There were no standouts, and the group blended together perfectly despite the age range. The young actors worked well with the older actors and had great chemistry. Their blocking was precisely orchestrated with each humorous punch to the stomach and door slam perfectly timed.
The language is simple, and the storyline is easy to follow. The humor is very physical, typical of farce and had the audience laughing without inhibition.
Noises Off is a lively show that anyone who loves comedy would enjoy. The only catch to this particular show is the company’s “in your face” tactic of asking for donations.
Through the course of the show, the audience was asked numerous times to donate $50 a month for 50 months to help the company achieve their goal of expansion. It was easily brushed off, but annoying nonetheless. The price is a little unfriendly to the typical college student, but there are student deals to avoid the hassle.
Tickets are available on anoisewithin.org. The show runs until Jan. 30

When British four-piece band Klaxons played its first U.S. show at the week-old Echoplex in April of 2007, the audience in the packed venue couldn’t stop dancing. Caustic guitars, frantic bass lines and falsetto choruses disguised catchy keyboard riffs that got feet moving to the band’s self-invented genre of nu-rave, even if no one really understood what it meant.
Saying goodbye · The newest album’s tracks show obvious influence from a new producer and do not match the characteristic Klaxon sound. - Photo courtesy of Press Here Publicity 
Band members’ affinities for brightly colored clothing aside, the music evoked more Arctic Monkeys or At The Drive In than traditional rave music.
Lyrical references to Thomas Pynchon, J.G. Ballard and other far-out authors further distanced them from any outfits that could be considered contemporaries.
Klaxons’ debut album Myths of the Near Future further alienated the band from definition.
Produced by Simian Mobile Disco’s James Ford, its theatrical songwriting made it one of those British exports that was overhyped yet simultaneously underrated.
The band members’ high-energy live shows and intensity helped them beat out Amy Winehouse for the 2007’s Best New Artist Mercury award, making them instant media darlings.
But after their successful win, the band evaded the spotlight, opting for time in Peru with the psychedelic drug ayahuasca instead.
When members finally re-emerged for interviews, Klaxons were in the process of recording their follow-up album with Ford, which they described to one journalist at the time as “noisy weirded-out prog.”
A year and a half later, after well-publicized rumors of the record label rejecting most of the finished songs and deeming them too experimental, Klaxons hit the studio with producer Ross Robinson and re-invented themselves with Surfing the Void, the band’s long-awaited sophomore album.
Released in the U.K. last August, Klaxons’ latest album was released last week in the United States as a deluxe edition with four extra songs, and beats out Best Coast for the funniest LOLcat album cover of the year. It’s a disappointing departure, though, from the raw energy and cluttered musicianship that made Myths so unique.
Robinson, of Korn, Slipknot and Blood Brothers, fame brought his nu-metal experience to the band, whittling down the psychedelic songs it had written and transforming the once indescribable band into a polished pop rock four-piece.
After the band had indulged in crazy time signatures and free-form association for the album-that-never-was, Robinson tried to shape the guys into a studio-worthy act for Void and the result is ten tracks of cleaned-up songs played by newly cleaned-up musicians.
The problem, however, is that Klaxons aren’t supposed to sound clean.
For all of Robinsons’ good intentions and professional recording techniques, the album falls short of its true potential.
In addition to lackluster songwriting on many of the tracks, the album suffers from production meant for a heavier, more Robinson-esque band.
Even on the songs where all of the elements are there, the perfectionist recording creates dissonance in the ears of those yearning for older, more blown-out anthems such as “Golden Skans” and “Atlantis to Interzone.”
The problem isn’t so much the musical direction that Klaxons have taken on Void, but the compressed pop sounds of Robinson’s production that are unbecoming for a band that once embraced gritty highs and lows.
Void’s opener “Echoes” and the first single “Flashover” sound most like what older fans would recognize as a Klaxons song, but something is missing in both. The drums are muted, the bass line isn’t dancing circles around the vocals and the space-age sounds are more strategically placed than atmospheric add-ins.
The second song on the album, “The Same Space,” is a catchy four-fourths song whose soaring vocals and thundering drums unfortunately belong more on My Chemical Romance’s The Black Parade than a Klaxons follow-up.
The same could be said for other tracks on the album such as “Venusia,” “Valley of Calm Trees” and “Future Memories,” whose slow tempos and mediocre vocal layering epitomizes the symptoms that arise when each instrument is recorded separately and mixed together later in Pro Tools.
If Klaxons hoped for American redemption with the “deluxe” portion of the album, this also missed the mark.
Instead of using the extra space as a way to share some experimental songs that didn’t make it onto the original album, it is instead an acoustic version of “Echoes” followed by a three-song digression into more blown-out pop songs.
The only redemption that may be possible for Void lies in Klaxons’ concerts. YouTube videos show much more unrefined live renditions of the album’s salvageable tunes, indicating that without Robinson’s influence, the band still possesses the power and talent to move feet on both sides of the pond.

Last week the buzz was all about Coachella’s lineup.
Much to the dismay of many followers of the Internet rumor mill and Tron fans, Daft Punk was not on the list. That’s fine with me. The world’s favorite costumed knob-twiddler duo headlined Lollapalooza a few years ago. Oh, wait. So did the rest of these bands.
Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
That’s the problem with music festivals. Once you’ve been to one, you’ve basically been to them all. There are only so many popular bands and musicians these days that headliners are bound to repeat themselves from festival to festival.
Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Coachella usually offer different artists and headliners from year to year. But if you’re fortunate enough to consistently attend more than one festival, or even the same festival from year to year, you’re likely to see the same artists.
Admittedly, there are some questionable calls on the lineup. Nas is one of the best rappers of all time and Damien Marley is unquestionably the most talented Marley offspring, but did anyone know they were still touring together after releasing one mediocre joint album last year? Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu? One extremely talented but incredibly insane ’90s R&B diva is enough. And who knows how the still-trying but no longer relevant ’80s band Duran Duran squeaked its way onto the bill.
Despite the less compelling performers, the festival is still packed with talent. Even if you have to sit through Duran Duran’s set while waiting for The Strokes or Kanye West, there is not much to complain about.
The music festival experience is unlike any other concert or entertainment event, and it’s only a couple  of hours away from campus. Make the trip to Indio, Calif. You won’t regret it.
If you do decide to make the journey to the desert, don’t forget to bring sunscreen and look out for these up-and-coming bands likely to put on great sets.
FRIDAY
Titus Andronicus: In my opinion, Titus Andronicus’ sophomore release The Monitor was the best album of 2010. The band of Springsteen lovin’ punk/indie rockers, led by impressively bearded front man Patrick Stickles, is one of the most exciting young bands in music, playing passionate punk rock with captivating lyrics and a healthy dose of Americana. DJ Pauly D didn’t make the bill, but these Jersey boys will have you fist pumpin’ along.
The Aquabats: It seems as if the world’s favorite band of skankin’ superheroes haven’t yet discovered their kryptonite. Despite numerous lineup changes, hiatus scares and drastic genre switches, this incredibly ridiculous but always entertaining band,  which formed in 1994, is still around. Three months after the release of their fifth studio album, they’re set to play the first day of Coachella.
SATURDAY
Bright Eyes: After 2008, it seemed as if Bright Eyes was dead. Until recently, gloomy front man Conor Oberst  has been performing as Conor Oberst & the Mystic Valley Band and as a member of the supergroup Monsters of Folk. With a new album due out in April, the return of Bright Eyes to the stage will be one of Saturday’s hot acts.
SUNDAY
OFF!: If you’ve ever liked punk music, then you owe a debt to former Black Flag and Circle Jerks singer Keith Morris. Off! is his new band, filled with other members of prominent punk acts. They’ve only released one 17-minute album, but their loud, frenetic show should be a great way to kick off Sunday morning.
Wiz Khalifa: Big things are happening in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are in the Superbowl again and this Pennsylvania native is finally gaining the success he’s worked so hard to achieve. His first single, “Say Yeah,” dominated airwaves and stayed high on the Billboard charts in 2008. It also sampled Alice Deejay’s “Better Off Alone” years before rappers were fusing their music with techno. Khalifa exploded last year after the success of the infectious “Black and Yellow.” Whether or not his popularity will carry to the big festival stage remains to be seen.

At exactly 5:38 a.m. Pacific Standard Time  Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revealed the nominations for the 83rd Academy Awards.
Announced by the Academy’s President, Tom Sherak, and 2009 Oscar winner Mo’Nique, the nominations for the ten major categories did not stray far from critics’ expectations.
The films that scored the most nominations in all categories, including technical awards, were The King’s Speech (12 nominations), True Grit (10 nominations), Inception (eight nominations), The Social Network (eight nominations) and The Fighter (seven nominations). Inception, however, managed to receive only one award for a major nomination category — best motion picture.
Indie film darlings 127 Hours, Black Swan, The Kids Are All Right and Winter’s Bone garnered impressive nominations in major categories.
Most films in the best motion picture category were also nominated in this month’s Golden Globe ceremony, with the exception of True Grit. Otherwise, the rest seem like easy choices. This is the second year that the Academy has nominated 10 films in this category.
Notably, Toy Story 3 is only the fourth fully animated feature film nominated for best picture, after the formerly recognized Beauty and the Beast (1991), WALL-E (2008) and Up (2009).
A number of first-time nominees are in running for a tiny gold statuette this year.
This is  especially true in the directing category, where Darren Aronofsky, David O. Russel and Tom Hooper have achieved nods for their work on Black Swan, The Fighter and The King’s Speech, respectively. First-time nominees also include supporting actors Christian Bale, John Hawkes and Mark Ruffalo for parts in The Fighter, Winter’s Bone and The Kids Are All Right, as well as lead actors Jesse Eisenberg and James Franco for The Social Network and 127 Hours.
Franco will also host the awards ceremony alongside actress Anne Hathaway, who was overlooked by the Academy for her Golden Globe-nominated performance in the sex-driven Love & Other Drugs.
Jennifer Lawrence from Winter’s Bone comes in as a fresh face. In the supporting category, however, Hailee Steinfeld and Jacki Weaver in True Grit and Animal Kingdom are previously unrecognized talent.
Foreign language film nominees include Outside the Law (Algeria), Incendies (Canada), In A Better World (Denmark), Dogtooth (Greece) and Biutiful (Mexico). Biutiful’s Javier Bardem also snagged a lead actor nomination for his portrayal of Uxbal, who speaks solely Spanish throughout the film. Only five other performers have won Academy Awards for roles spoken in languages other than English.
Though many of the nominations might not seem a stretch from predictions, a few surprises remain. Michelle Williams, for example, earned a nod in the lead actress character for her role as a frustrated wife in Blue Valentine, but her fiery costar Ryan Gosling was snubbed.
Additionally, summer surprise The Town only took one nomination for Jeremy Renner’s brooding supporting role performance, with no nod to the swarthy and intense Ben Affleck. Mark Ruffalo and Annete Benning also took accolades from the Academy for their performances in the ensemble drama The Kids Are All Right, but Julianne Moore, the link between their two characters, did not earn a supporting actress nomination.
The 83rd Annual Academy Awards will take place at the Kodak Theatre on Sunday, Feb. 27 and will be broadcasted by the ABC.

President Barack Obama delivered his second official State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress tonight in a much different climate than last year, coming off of a midterm election that saw the Republican Party take control of the House and make gains in the Senate.
After beginning his speech with a congratulation to the new Congress as well as a mention of recovering Rep. Gabrielle Giffords that elicited a standing ovation, Obama proceeded to outline a general plan for an America he sees as “poised for progress,” without delineating many particulars, as is the case in most State of the Union addresses.
Obama attempted to reassure the public that the nation is emerging from the struggles of the past several years. He painted a vivid picture of a future with a greater commitment to clean energy and innovation, and motivated America’s young to become the next generation of leaders.
The president’s speech succeeded in evoking a mostly bipartisan attitude while still challenging the GOP on certain topics, including the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and the need for immigration reform along the lines of the DREAM Act.
Rep. Paul Ryan delivered the Republican response to the president’s address, giving a speech that took a strong stance on GOP ideals while still reassuring the public that they would work together with the president to accomplish their goals.
Rep. Michele Bachmann delivered an unprecedented Tea Party response televised only on CNN, which seemed to drop all conciliatory notions Ryan might have brought up and explicitly blamed the Obama administration for budget problems.

America is not the same international power it once was, but that is not to say that the United States is on the decline. Rather, several factors have altered Washington’s control over the international system.
Globalization has redefined competition at the international level.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The nature of global competition is significantly different than it was half a century ago. Economic power now plays a greater role than military strength in defining a nation’s position in the international system.
Countries need to focus on growing their economies and improving their education systems to become or remain major powers.
Our ability to compete with other advanced nations is contingent on our educational standards.
In other words, guns and nukes are being replaced by GDP and test scores as the drivers of international success.
Now and in the future, Washington should refocus its economic energy. That means reducing the deficit, stimulating the economy and bolstering international trade and investment, which is no easy task. But accomplishing all of these things will assure that the United States remains a superpower.
Economic success will also become more and more dependent on high education standards because the global economy is now a knowledge-based economy.
“Nowhere does low performance more acutely affect the health of the U.S. economy than in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,” according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
So far, the United States isn’t performing well enough.
In fact, the NBER  reported that American 15-year-olds scored well below the average for science literacy and placed behind most developed nations on critical skills and competencies.
President Obama has said that American students have to be able to compete with workers anywhere in the world.
Two critical arenas — our education and our economy — are no longer independent of one another. Now the success or failure of our nation’s economy depends solely on our schools.
Success on this ambitious but necessary goal will depend on whether or not Washington is able to elevate American standards for education, and it will require very difficult and politically charged decisions about government spending.
Revamping our education system so more young Americans graduate from college is one of the most important ways the United States can remain competitive in the international system.
In June 2010, Georgetown’s Center for Education and the Workforce reported that by 2018, 64 percent of job openings will require workers with some college education or better.
Jobs in manufacturing, farming, fishing and forestry will be permanently replaced by jobs in industries such as computer and data processing, the latter of which often require a college education.
In the coming months, and especially leading up to the 2012 election, there will be tremendous debate in Washington about government spending.
In the current financial climate, it is fair to say that cuts need to be made. Yet, it is unlikely that the Obama administration will gain bipartisan support as to where they should be made. Lacking a major military threat, Washington might be advised to cut the defense budget and avoid cuts to education.
After all, in today’s world it has become clear that our major national interest is to compete with other advanced nations through  academic prowess — not necessarily through military power.
Ultimately, the United States faces a significant uphill climb to remain the world’s superpower. The Obama administration will need to think long and hard about addressing both the educational and economic problems that have caused our nation to fall behind while other countries surge forward.

Champlain College, a small college in Vermont, requires all undergraduates to take two sessions in financial literacy.
The seminars, focusing on life skills and personal finance, cover a variety of financial concepts from understanding credit to repaying student loans.
Such educational resources are students’ best defense against financial pitfalls. There is an urgent need for financial education and resources for college students to prevent bad habits from starting early.
But instead, financial literacy often falls through the educational cracks.
As one of the strongest business schools in the nation, the Marshall School of Business should take a proactive approach toward financial literacy by offering classes on the subject.
Last spring, Katie Price, a senior majoring in finance and accounting, organized a personal finance speaker series, much in the same vein as Champlain’s seminars.
She felt a pressing need for students, as individuals with personal financial responsibility and as active consumers, to understand how to handle money.
“[Financial education] is one of the most important things that a person can learn, particularly given all of the stuff that’s happened the past few years. It feels like it doesn’t matter yet, but it should,” Price said. “There are a lot of actions kids can take in their young twenties to set themselves up to have an easier time transitioning in the future.”
Price brought in professionals such as local real estate agents and Morgan Stanley wealth managers to discuss the fundamentals of finance. Four sessions were held on real estate, wealth management, budgeting and taxes.
The USC Credit Union has put together similar money management seminars for USC students, faculty and staff. The seminars begin in February and cover a range of key concepts, from student loan repayment to home buying basics.
As young college students, buying a home or retiring might seem far off. It probably is, but that doesn’t make  planning for it any less important.
For those who didn’t learn about managing money while growing up, there is no better place than college to acquire that education. Even learning the most basic money concepts is crucial for a job-searching student.
College is meant to prepare us to be exceptional in whatever field we might enter in the future. But beyond being students or professionals, we are individuals with needs and goals, many of those governed by money.
David Finney, president of Champlain, expressed a hope that the college’s seminars will become a national model for financial education.
I hope so too.
Events such as the speaker series that Price put together and the upcoming Credit Union seminars bring USC closer to the forefront of developing such a model.
Price does not have the  proper resources to run the speaker series again, despite student interest.
In today’s economic climate, financial literacy is becoming increasingly essential to individual security and the healthy of society, in both the short-term and long-term.
At a university with a world-class business school and a wealth of resources, USC students should not be left without a basic financial education.

With the recent announcement of the Coachella 2011 line-up, Southern Californians and people all over the country have shown great enthusiasm for the event, which will begin on Apr. 15 and go for three full days.
However, there is another festival, that also makes a big impression every year, and it is called the Bamboozle Music Festival.
Held at The Meadowlands Sports Complex the first weekend of every May, this event has grown in size every year. It started out with humble beginnings in Asbury Park, New Jersey as a mainly alternative rock festival going by the name of the Skate and Surf Festival. In 2003, the organizers made the move to the Meadowlands Complex, changed the name to the Bamboozle Festival, and thereby cemented their concert event as one that could garner national attention and international travel every year. As the festival has evolved, so too have its headliners.
This year, the festival will again continue its trend of getting bigger and more diverse names to end the days properly, with appearances by rapper Lil Wayne, classic rockers Motley Crue, and R&B artist Bruno Mars alongside a multitude of alternative rock bands on the bill. Other performers include Taking Back Sunday, The Gaslight Anthem, Anberlin, New Found Glory, the reunion of Gatsby’s American Dream, and A Day to Remember.
Over 100 bands and comedians are expected to perform starting on Apr. 29 and ending May 1 and this rock-n-roll circus of sorts is set to attract perhaps its largest crowd yet. Of course, there are plenty of mediocre bands on the line-up that patrons will have to endure to see their favorites, but that is the case with any music festival.
After all, if people are not enjoying the music, they can just flock to the popular carnival rides including a Ferris Wheel that offers a view of the New York City skyline.

Given USC’s location in downtown Los Angeles, crime can seem almost inevitable, especially when there are two gangs operating within miles of campus. These groups are active and potentially dangerous, but their threat doesn’t extend to the USC campus, experts say.
Reform · Jorja Leap, a UCLA professor who works at Homeboy Industries, stands with Fabian Debora, a former gang member, in front of a mural Debora painted as part of the program. - Photo courtesy of Jorja Leap 
Instead, Jorja Leap, a gang researcher and UCLA professor, said the campus itself motivates, inspires and shows others that a higher quality of life exists.
Leap has been working on a five-year study at Homeboy Industries, following 300 gang members as they go through the Homeboy/Homegirl program, which works to counsel young people and to redirect their lives. Leap said all the gang members she has worked with perceive USC as a symbol of opportunity, and most wouldn’t dare bring violence to the campus area.
“For them, USC is sacred and they don’t cross the line,” Leap said. “I’m saying this as someone whose been on the faculty at UCLA, and I’m not really interested in propaganda at USC. But this is a phenomenon I’ve seen among the gang members that I’ve worked with.”
Dept. of Public Safety Assistant Chief John Thomas said the two gangs closest to campus are the Fruit Town Brims, and the Harpys. Thomas said the Fruit Town Brims are small in comparison to the Harpys, but their area is defined as south of Jefferson Boulevard and west of Vermont Avenue.
Leap said these gang members recognize the benefits that USC offers to the community.
“Eighty percent of these members love USC, and they want their kids to go to USC,” Leap said. “USC is almost like Switzerland, it’s like a neutral zone and they all observe this.”
This rings true for Thomas, who grew up near USC, and ultimately was inspired to attend UCLA.
“If it wasn’t for USC, I would never have thought that a college education was a reality. It was the USC students, the people at Doheny, the programs I would go to, being on that campus, and all those things that made UCLA a reality,” Thomas said.
Thomas said that gangs don’t often bother students who live in the area, and that the main effect the gang presence has on the community is that it compromises quality of life through intimidation.
DPS, LAPD and other departments have been able to identify and closely monitor the majority of the gang members, Thomas said.
DPS uses a system called CompStat that compiles all of the crimes that occur every week, according to Thomas. This is part of an accountability process where every week, DPS and other departments dissect the causes of crimes to put together strategies. Thomas said this helps DPS detect patterns of crime earlier, increasing the chances of preventing similar crimes from occurring.
“We get a very intimate sense of what’s occurring, where it’s occurring, but usually when we start seeing these patterns, we’re able to jump on them real early to the point where most people don’t see it coming because we’re able to use strategies,” Thomas said.
When gang members from the area are released from jail, LAPD officers and other officers often meet with the members to help ease them into a life without crime.
Leap and Thomas said that for USC to keep crime rates low, the university needs to maintain community outreach programs as a way to show these at-risk children that a better life exists.
“[Community outreach programs are] a win-win. This benefits USC and benefits the community,” Leap said. “The university is kind of a place of enlightenment and it is important USC doesn’t become a place of suppression.”
Thomas can personally attest to the value of USC’s community outreach programs.
“You walked onto that campus, and you had stepped into a whole other reality, you really did,” he said. “For the folks around [the USC] neighborhood, it’s a blessing to live around USC, it always has been. You felt fortunate.”

President Barack Obama is expected to stress job growth and his plan to tackle the nation’s mounting debt in his second State of the Union Address tonight.
In a tradition dating back to George Washington’s presidency, Obama will appear before a joint-session of Congress to outline his plan for the coming year.
Obama’s State of the Union has been titled “Winning the Future” and will focus on innovation through the strengthening of the education and economic sectors.
In a press briefing yesterday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs outlined Obama’s focus on the creation of jobs both now and in the future.
“You’ll hear the President … spend most of his time talking about the economy, talking about the challenges that we face both in the short term in terms of doing whatever we can to help create jobs, in the medium and long term to continue working on issues like competitiveness and innovation and ensuring that in the medium and the long term we get our fiscal house in order,” Gibbs said.
In addressing the nation’s $14 trillion debt, Obama will most likely reject his debt commission’s recommendation to raise the retirement age and reduce Social Security benefits.
Obama will also continue to promote businesses, especially after naming William Daley, the former Midwest Chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase, as the new White House of Chief of Staff, and Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, as head of a new economic advisory committee.
Obama will request additional funding for education, and to strike a balance with Republicans, he will discuss teacher tenure and teacher evaluations.
In the wake of the Tucson shooting and intensified partisan divide in politics, congressional members will not sit by party, as they traditionally do, but rather next to members of the opposite party.
The Republicans’ response will be delivered by Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan, who is presumed to highlight the Republicans’ plan to curtail U.S. debt, including drastic cuts in Social Security and the eventual elimination of Medicare.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the USC Annenberg Center on Community Leadership and Policy will be hosting a panel discussion and live broadcast of Obama’s State of the Union address tonight in the Annenberg East Lobby.

The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recently cited USC as one of 115 colleges and universities notable for their collaborations with neighboring communities.
The Carnegie Foundation, an independent policy and research center committed to transforming and improving American higher education, issues classifications every few years naming colleges and universities that meet various goals outlined by the foundation’s mission.
Daily Trojan
This year, the foundation invited schools with exceptional commitment to community engagement to apply for the Community Engagement Classification, which was first offered in 2006. USC applied in September, and was notified this month that they had received the classification.
“Through a classification that acknowledges significant commitment to and demonstration of community engagement, the Foundation encourages colleges and universities to become more deeply engaged, to improve teaching and learning and to generate socially responsive knowledge to benefit communities,” said Anthony Bryk, president of the foundation, in a press release.
Bryk said that in awarding the classification, the foundation went beyond national data and evaluated the specific community outreach programs at each of the schools.
After receiving applications for the classification, the foundation worked with the New England Resource Center for Higher Education to review examples of the schools’ work in their communities.
For USC, the classification is a welcome acknowledgement of a focus on community interests that was a hallmark of former President Steven B. Sample’s administration and continues to be a priority under President C. L. Max Nikias.
One of the programs that helped earn USC its classification from the Carnegie Foundation was the Joint Educational Project. Since its founding in 1972, JEP has become one of the nation’s largest service-learning programs, said Tina Koneazny, associate director for administration and educational outreach with JEP.
“It’s a huge honor and it really validates all the work we’ve been doing in the community for the last several years,” Koneazny said.
The programs at JEP aim to turn community service into service-learning by combining volunteer work with academic coursework. At the center of the project are eight-week programs that give students opportunities to volunteer in the community in roles such as mentoring and tutoring.
“We’re giving USC students the opportunity to learn and grow through their work in the community, while the community still benefits,” Koneazny said.
Cole Finney, a freshman majoring in theater, said he thinks collaboration between the university and the surrounding community is good for USC.
“Helping out in the community improves USC’s image with our neighbors,” Finney said. “It benefits both sides and is important for the growth of the school.”
In addition to JEP, a number of other student-run service organizations and projects at USC were also cited as part of the classification, including Trojan Health Volunteers, Writers in the Community, Troy Camp and the Neighborhood Academic Initiative.
Maxine Welcome, co-executive director for Troy Camp, said the volunteers seem to gain just as much from the experience as the community children do.
“As long as we continue with the philosophy of helping our community and getting involved with the neighbhorhood that we live in, we’ll be in a good place,” Welcome said. “From what I see, I’m really impressed.”
Koneazny said the collaboration between students in different academic schools contributes to JEP’s ability to affect a variety of sectors in the community.
“It’s really all across campus, not just at JEP or a specific volunteer center,” she said. “It’s all different pieces of the university coming together for this honor.”

USC recently released a detailed report of its greenhouse gas emission activities from 2001 to 2009 to provide a baseline number of the amount of emissions during a typical year.
The report, which was put together by the USC Office of Sustainability, highlights the gas emission output of both USC’s University Park Campus and Health Sciences Campus.
This report was completed to help understand where the university stands on such an important issue as GHG emissions, according to Ed Becker, the executive director of Environmental Health and Safety.
“This is the first greenhouse gas emission inventory that the university has done, and it can help in gauging what to do in the future,” Becker said. “The faculty and students can work together, look at the inventory and use this data to create something. What they’ll create, we will have to wait to see.”
The emissions output is categorized into three scopes that includes direct emissions, indirect emissions and the emission of GHGs from the creation of products and services that the university employs.
In the last couple of years, USC has become more environmentally aware, according to Becker.
“There is an energy department on campus that has done numerous energy projects for the last couple of years, replacing better efficient light bulbs, chilling systems, among other things,” Becker said.
As USC works toward a greener future, this report is a step in building student involvement and becoming a more sustainable campus.
“Put out a rich set of data and the academic community will take it in a direction we never imagined,” Becker said.
As a whole, the university has had a 19 percent increase in GHG emissions from the year 2001 to 2009, according to the report. Emissions, which peaked in 2007, have decreased by 3 percent as a direct correlation to the actions the university has taken toward becoming more environmentally friendly.
Becker said a green office program was started recently, where different on campus departments can certify their commitment to being environmentally friendly.
This report is only the starting point, according to Becker.
“We didn’t have a baseline before, this report is intended to form a baseline for future inventory and allow for students and faculty to make comparisons when experimenting,” Becker said.
The report measures GHG in tonnes, which is a metric unit equal to about 2,200 pounds. From 2001 to 2009, USC emitted an estimated 1.4 million tonnes into the atmosphere.
The report puts the number into perspective by comparing USC’s combined output of 1.4 million tonnes to New York City’s annual output of 60 million tonnes.
“The main goal is that we want USC to be a living laboratory for students and for them to really learn about energy efficiency projects and the effect of GHGs in the environment,” Becker said. “We want to provide the information and pathway to apply some of the things they are learning, to use USC and its resources to experiment.”
Becker said because USC is such a large campus, any successful programs to eliminate GHG emissions might also be applied to larger metropolitan areas.
The report details the emission of gas in different buildings on campus during each individual month to demonstrate how weather, occupancy and other factors either contribute to an increase or decrease of GHG emissions.
Jeffrey Nakashioya, a junior majoring in environmental science, said he thinks that the GHG emission report was a smart move by USC.
“It’s great that they are making the information more accessible to the students,” Nakashioya said. “Awareness and an honest evaluation of the issues are crucial if good policy is to follow.”
