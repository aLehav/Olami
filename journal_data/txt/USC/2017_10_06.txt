Dr. Rohit Varma resigned from his position as dean of the Keck School of Medicine on Thursday, according to a letter from Varma to Keck staff and faculty obtained by the Daily Trojan.
“I care deeply about the Keck School and felt it was in the best interest of the school for me to step down at this time,” Varma said in the letter.
The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that in 2003, USC had disciplined Varma following allegations that he had sexually harassed a researcher while he was a junior professor.
USC did not confirm that the sexual harassment accusation and Varma’s resignation were related.
“Today we learned previously undisclosed information that caused us to lose confidence in Dr. Varma’s ability to lead the school,” USC Provost Michael Quick said in a statement. “Our leaders must be held to the highest standards. Dr. Varma understands this, and chose to step down.”
At the time of the alleged harassment, Varma was a 40-year-old ophthalmologist who had worked alongside Mother Teresa, according to a USC press release when he was installed as dean.
The Times reported that Varma told the woman that he had booked a single room for them to share. She said that while she protested, Varma took her phone and threatened to have her visa revoked.
Following the incident, Varma was denied an expected promotion, his salary was reduced by $30,000 and he was ordered to go through sexual harassment counseling, according to the Times. USC reached a $135,000 settlement with the woman, of which Varma paid $11,000.
In 2004, Varma’s salary reduction was removed and he was promoted to full professor the following year.
While Varma’s letter to Keck faculty and staff was dated Wednesday, Oct. 4, the letter was sent after 5 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 5. 
The Times also reported receiving a statement from the University on Oct. 4 defending Varma.
“This incident was addressed and resolved 15 years ago,” the statement read. “We carefully considered Dr. Varma’s character and qualifications before rehiring and promoting him. We remain confident in his ability to lead the Keck School of Medicine.”
Today, USC’s statement read that USC leadership had “lost confidence in Dr. Rohit Varma’s ability to lead” the medical school.
Varma had been selected to replace former Keck dean Carmen Puliafito following his resignation in March 2016. Varma began his tenure as dean in November 2016.

Last July, the Los Angeles Times reported that Puliafito had engaged in drug use while dean of Keck and had kept company with convicted criminals and an underage drug user.
According the the Times, a few weeks before his resignation, Puliafito was present at a Pasadena hotel party where a woman he had been affiliated with suffered a drug overdose.
Quick said in Thursday’s statement that he is currently working to name an interim dean and following that appointment will complete a “full national search process” to name a new dean.
“I know there are many important issues to be attended to in the near future, and I look forward to working closely with the Keck School of Medicine in the days and months ahead,” Quick said in the statement.
The Keck School is hosting an event Friday at noon in a location that had not been determined at time of publication.
Varma did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Fire. Max. Nikias.  I’ve lost count of the number of scandals under his tenure.  USC needs to clean house, starting at the top.
Would you please douse your torches and put away your pitchforks. Change gonna come.
At this point, I’m not even surprised. Is there actually a campaign going on to undermine the reputation of the university? It would be one thing if this info was unknown to USC… But the school can’t even do a background check and make a solid, moral decision on information it is ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF. If this isn’t willful ignorance or recklessness, who knows what is… and the school wasn’t even going to do anything about it until the L.A. Times was going to out them! I’ll always be a proud alum, but it’s hard to imagine encouraging anyone to donate a dime to this place until the trash responsible for this gets taken out.
To paraphrase Steve Earle, KSOM, don’t you reckon it’s time?
If this latest scandal doesn’t make USC’s Health Sciences Campus feel like a red-headed stepchild, nothing will.
In The Official Ranking of US Medical Schools for 2005 KSOM placed 32nd, below the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Medical School and well below the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. On a similar survey, conducted by U.S. News, HSC placed 31st. KSOM was great once, time to be great again.
Time for Michael Quick to go!
He is a mediocre administrator at best, a failed leader, and an embarrassment to our school.
At a time when we need the best of the best, we have an incompetent in the office of the Provost.
That front page scandals keep happening at USC should give the Board of Trustees pause about the direction of the university and whether degrees from USC are being devalued as a result.
Quick, shut down the Greek system before anyone finds out about another SC administration problem!
I find it so ironic that one ophthalmologist followed another in this high drama of leadership when a blind person could have seen this coming.

USC named Laura Mosqueda, chair of the Department of Family Medicine and associate dean of primary care, the interim dean of the Keck School of Medicine on Friday. Her provisional appointment comes in the wake of administrative issues at Keck that have led to the resignations of the last two deans within a two-year span.
“Dr. Mosqueda will work closely with President Nikias and me to support you as we strengthen and improve the culture at the Keck School,” Provost Michael Quick said in a memo on Friday addressed to Keck students, faculty and staff. 
Earlier that day, Keck hosted a town hall to allow students to express their concerns and frustrations about the school’s administration. Rohit Varma resigned as dean of the Keck School of Medicine on Thursday, less than a year after starting the job. 
On the same day, the Los Angeles Times revealed he had been disciplined for sexual harassment in 2003. His predecessor, Carmen Puliafito, reportedly engaged in drug-fueled misconduct and associated with convicted criminals during his term, according to a July report from the Los Angeles Times. 
In front of a full crowd at the Mayer Auditorium on the Health Sciences Campus, Keck officials reiterated the University’s commitment to students’ education in the wake of the administrative scandals. Students also voiced their concerns regarding the disruptions in the past year.
“I know in the past 18 months we’ve gone through some turmoil, but rest assured that under no circumstances [do] these experiences and challenges … diminish the Keck profile that we assured you we were going to work on from the time you matriculated at this institution,” Vice Dean of Medical Education Henri Ford told the crowd.
Ryan Kraus, a medical student at Keck, opened the Q&A session by asking how the University recommends students confront any doubts potential employers may have about the quality of a USC education because of Keck’s leadership. After the report about Puliafito came out, Kraus said he faced questions about the former dean during an interview. Now, he is worried the same will happen regarding Varma.

Associate Dean for Student and Educational Affairs Donna Elliott told students to expect questions. Elliott advised students to reframe the narrative to focus on their Keck education and not on issues with the Keck administration. 
Keck will provide students with talking points for their interviews to ensure they can avoid discussing the Keck administration, Elliott said. She also emphasized how the Keck education “has not been compromised by any of these events,” and said that the process of finding a replacement dean could take up to a year.
Other students at the town hall criticized the University’s handling of the situation. Some noted they found out about Varma’s sexual harassment allegations first from a Los Angeles Times article and not directly from Keck.
Jeremy Hardin, a medical student at Keck, read out a printed letter detailing his concerns with USC’s actions. Hardin praised Ford, Elliott and the rest of the Keck academic deans for their work, but noted his disappointment with what he sees as a lack of institutional responsibility in a “culture [that] endorses the obfuscation of truth.”
“This problem is bigger than all of us,” Hardin said. “It involves the hidden mechanisms of power at USC that none of us can seem to touch, and until we hold those in power accountable together, as a united group of principled students and faculty, I see no reason why we should expect anything to change.”
Varma’s resignation came as the Los Angeles Times was expecting to publish a report regarding a sexual harassment incident that occurred while he was a junior professor at USC. 
The Times reported that Varma told a female researcher he was working with that he had booked a single room for them to share at a conference they were both attending. She said that when she protested, Varma took her phone and threatened to have her visa revoked.
When she reported Varma’s actions to USC, the administration reduced his salary by $30,000, denied him an expected promotion and required him to receive counseling about sexual harassment. His full salary was reinstated in 2004 and he was promoted to a full professorship in 2005, the Times reported.
USC did not confirm that the sexual harassment accusation and Varma’s resignation were related.
“Today we learned previously undisclosed information that caused us to lose confidence in Dr. Varma’s ability to lead the school,” Provost Michael Quick said in a statement on Thursday. 
Ford expressed his belief that everyone makes mistakes and that in some cases, second chances should be given. 
“Everybody’s entitled to a second chance, or a third chance, or multiple chances, as long as we’re not going back and committing the same infraction,” Ford said. “So to that extent, I think it’s not unreasonable to give someone who has made a mistake some 15 years ago a second chance, who has especially demonstrated exemplary behavior since then.”
Ford’s reasoning of a “second chance” for Varma was met with doubt from some students. Claire Conrad, a medical student at Keck, expressed concerns about USC’s decision to offer a second chance to an individual with a history of sexual harassment. 
“This makes me really uncomfortable and unsafe going forward in my career and knowing that despite everything … the community and values held at Keck [are] that [sexual harassment] happened and there was a second chance given,” Conrad said.
Ford said, however, that Keck was working to try to maintain a stable academic environment for students despite the administrative changes taking place. 
“To take a former dean that had defiled the name of the University and replace him with someone else who has a history of sexual harassment shows poor judgment,” Ford said. “What I can say is this is beyond my jurisdiction — and it’s not something we’re involved in. I can only focus on the quality of the educational environment.”

Last Saturday, USC lost for the first time in 13 games, or 371 days. Now the Trojans are looking to rebound against conference foe Oregon State in their return to the Coliseum.
After their shocking defeat last weekend, the Trojans plummeted from No. 5 to No. 14 in the AP rankings. Their national championship hopes are on hold, at least for the time being. Whether or not the Trojans can reassert themselves in the conversation will be based largely on the team’s health following a litany of injuries.
In the second half against Washington State, USC was forced to play three back-ups on the offensive line. Junior tackle Toa Lobendahn was already out with a staph infection, junior tackle Chuma Edoga exited with a knee injury and senior guard Viane Talamaivao, who has the most career starts amongst the entire unit, tore his pectoral muscle. Talamaivao will miss the rest of the season giving USC two devastating losses on the same day.
With an inexperienced crew at offensive line, sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold struggled for much of Saturday’s game. He started out hot, going 4-of-5 on pass attempts and rushing for a touchdown on USC’s first offensive drive, but afterwards he had difficulty finding ample time in the pocket. Darnold finished with just 164 yards on a 51.7 completion percentage, both career lows among his 14 career starts. His disappointing day culminated in a game-ending fumble with 1:27 left on the clock and the Trojans down by 3. Despite the rough outing, Helton sees USC’s first home game in two weeks as a potential bounce-back game for the Heisman hopeful.
“I hope to see more consistent flow, I really do,” Helton said. “Just consistent drives, kind of like the first drive. I thought when that first drive hit, it felt like a great flow of run, pass, staying on pace, third- and- manageable and then efficiency in the red zone.”
This week, USC should be more healthy at the skill positions, aside from freshman running back Stephen Carr, who is doubtful with a foot injury. Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett played through a shoulder injury last week, but should be closer to 100 percent now especially with an extra day of rest this week. Meanwhile, junior running back Ronald Jones II returned from injury last week and burst open for a career-long 86-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.
Combine those two with the likely return of senior wideout Steven Mitchell Jr., who missed two games due to a groin injury, and the emergence of freshman Tyler Vaughns — who notched 89 yards with two clutch catches in the fourth quarter — and it looks as though Darnold will have plenty of weapons at his disposal come Saturday. However, with starting tackles Edoga and Lobendahn listed as questionable, the real question will be whether or not he has enough time to get the ball to those athletes.
“When you lose two linemen, it changes you a little bit,” Helton said. “I’ve been there as a playcaller before.”
On the defensive side of the ball, Helton is happy with the team’s progress, despite giving up 340 passing yards to quarterback Luke Falk and the Washington State offense last week. Behind junior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu — who defended eight passes — and the secondary’s collective ball hawking mentality, USC has shown to be adept at making the big plays, but inconsistent at getting off the field in key situations. The team proved this by holding Washington State to 8-of-18 on third downs. The unit is seventh in Pac-12 scoring defense, giving up 25.8 points per game, but simultaneously has forced the second-most interceptions (eight) and third-most sacks (16) in the conference.
“We have put a lot of pressure on our DBs,” Helton said. “They’ve held up extremely well throughout the season. When you have an aggressive game-plan, you count on each man doing their job and for the most part everybody has been.”
This weekend defense will be dealing with a much less prolific offense than Washington State’s. The Beavers’ best player, running back Ryan Nall, is doubtful with an ankle injury, while the passing game has been ineffective with quarterback Jake Luton under center.
Overall, Oregon State is off to a difficult start to its 2017 campaign to say the least. In head coach Gary Andersen’s third year in Corvallis, the team is 1-4 with their only win coming against FCS squad Portland State by three points (and Portland State is currently winless).
Despite their string of injuries and offensive woes, Oregon State played a tough game against No. 6 Washington last week. The Huskies led just 7-0 entering half-time, despite possessing the second highest scoring offense in the Pac-12, before eventually pulling away and winning 42-7.
“I thought defensively, they did a really nice job in the first half,” Helton said. “The past couple of games, they’ve played a little bit more loaded box, cover-1, cover-3 coverages. I’ll tell you what, I thought they competed at home.”
The last time USC lost to Oregon State was back in 2010 when the Beavers won 36-7 at home. In 2008, Oregon State beat No. 1 ranked USC in one of the more notable upsets in recent memory.

Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
Football is a fickle business. Head coach Clay Helton knows this better than almost anyone. At a football program like USC — with so much history and prestige — if you’re not winning, your seat grows hotter and hotter by the week. One day you’re the hero who turned a season around after a disastrous start; the next, your leadership is questioned after a loss to a ranked team on the road during a short week.
In the 28 games Helton has led the Trojans, he has experienced it all. Last season, after a 1-3 start that led everyone to press the panic button, people questioned whether Helton was fit to lead the Trojans. But after rattling off nine straight wins, USC celebrated underneath confetti in the Rose Bowl. The criticism was nowhere to be found.
As the Trojans enter their sixth game of the season, the pressure is back on the head coach and his team. Entering the season, you would’ve been hard-pressed to hear a conversation about the College Football Playoff without USC in the discussion. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was Vegas’ favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. But following the Trojans’ loss against Washington State, the hype train has stalled. After two bad games, Darnold is behind in the Heisman race. USC is 4-1, but they slipped down to 14th in the AP Poll.
“As a coach you kind of take a step back,” Helton said. “You’re hurting inside, but you also view your team and see how much they care. There were grown men crying in that locker room [against Washington State]. There was not one word that was said on the 45-minute bus ride from the stadium to the airport. I looked at their faces on the plane, and they were hurt.”
With seven games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Trojans will now be forced to battle for their playoff lives on a weekly basis. On his conference call following the tough road loss, Helton emphasized that USC still remains in the driver’s seat.
“The message to our team is that one game doesn’t define our season,” Helton said. “We had a hard-fought game on the road against a very good opponent. We just finished September. We’re 4-1, and we control our own destiny. We could not say that a year ago.”
But even if USC’s position has improved from this point last season, the team’s approach remains the same.
“We’re not hoping for a game to go one way or another,” Helton said. “We just have to go out there and do our job, and every goal that we have out there is there. We control our own destiny.”
“Control your own destiny.” It’s a phrase that Helton has preached to his team and repeated over and over again to the media. Drawing from his experience last year, Helton realized his team had fought through worse. During his tenure, Helton has instilled a sense of resiliency in the program. Whether that means that the Trojans can come back from any deficit or bouncing back from a tough loss, it doesn’t matter.
“As a head coach, you can do one of two things,” Helton said. “Because you have a failure or a loss, you can panic and try to scrap everything. Or you can believe in the men that surround you. I choose to believe in the players that surround me as well as our coaches. I really, truly believe they’re gonna get the job done.
“It’s not what happens to you,” he continued. “But how you react.”
While he wasn’t seen as a sexy hire, Helton has brought a Southern flair to Southern California. By combining the traditional West Coast offense with an SEC-inspired toughness, Helton’s philosophy can be summed up as a desire to have the best of both worlds. In their game against Stanford, a program that prides itself on physicality, the Trojans dominated the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. Against Texas, USC aired it out more and won on the shoulders of Darnold. But for the past two weeks, USC’s offense has struggled. While injuries have decimated the offensive line and tested the depth of the receivers, the Trojans will need more out of their offensive unit, Darnold included.
Following their game over the weekend, Helton and his squad participated in “Tell the Truth Monday.” The Trojans sat down and assessed where they were as a team upon reviewing the film from their last game. USC hasn’t had a “Tell the Truth Monday” following a loss since their defeat at Utah last September. After going over a full calendar year without losing a game, the Trojans now find themselves in a do-or-die situation when it comes to the College Football Playoff. With a focus on accountability, hard work and resilience, Helton and the Trojans will try to move USC back to where the storied program is used to being: the championship conversation.

In front of a rowdy home crowd, men’s water polo defeated the No. 7 Long Beach State 49ers 11-9 in overtime Thursday. After beating the 49ers 13-5 earlier this season, the Trojans headed into the rematch ranked No. 1 for the first time in the 2017 season. Nevertheless, the 49ers kept the game close, never trailing by more than 3 points.
“That was a scary one, for sure,” senior goalie McQuin Baron said. “I didn’t like that much but it’s always good to have a game like this, play under pressure because last season we didn’t really play any overtime games or any fourth-quarter close games and this season we’ve had four or five already. So going into the back end of our season, going back to these games will really help us out.”
From the start, the game was tight, with both teams held scoreless for the first six minutes. USC two-meter sophomore Matt Maier broke through and scored with 1:39 left in the first, and senior utility Bryce Hoerman tacked onto the Trojans’ lead with 37 seconds left. The 49ers were able to respond quickly in the second, tying the game by the half 3-3. 
The third quarter play remained close, and the Trojans entered the fourth with a slim 6-5 lead. USC added two more goals in the fourth, but with 3:29 left, Long Beach scored three unanswered goals to tie the score at 8, sending the game into overtime.
“In between quarters there, overtime and everything, it was just X’s and O’s,” senior utility James Walters said. “We were talking about what we can do differently, some things that we didn’t do so well and what we were going to do on the next play. For us it’s just what’s going to happen next time.”
With 4.7 seconds left in the first overtime, Maier broke through to give the Trojans a 9-8 lead. Freshman driver Marko Vavic followed with a goal early in double overtime for the Trojans. Long Beach junior defender Austin Stevenson scored with 1:15 left in the game to close the gap to 10-9, but USC senior driver Grant Stein scored with a second left in the session to seal the win for the Trojans, 11-9.
With the ultimate goal of a national championship in mind, the team still has room to improve before heading into the back half of its season.
“Counterattack defense needs to be better, we need to improve on that,” Baron said. “Our 6-on-5 was kind of weak today, I think on a few of them we didn’t even get a shot, which is kind of unacceptable when you have a man advantage.”
With their four-game winning streak at stake, the No. 1 ranked Trojans have two days to rest before traveling to No. 8 UC Santa Barbara Saturday. 
“Santa Barbara, you never know,” Walters said. “Their pool, one end is shallow, the crowd is great there, it’s always a really fun environment, there’s a lot of energy there. I’m looking forward to that game, and I know the guys are. It’s always fun.”

The No. 15 women’s volleyball team (12-3, 4-0 Pac-12) heads to Arizona to face the Arizona Wildcats (7-7, 1-4 Pac-12) on Friday and the Arizona State Sun Devils (10-6, 0-4 Pac-12) on Saturday.
The Women of Troy are coming off a sweep against No. 9 Washington on Sunday and a four-set win over Washington State on Saturday. The team is currently undefeated in conference play, jumping out to a hotter start than originally predicted. The team’s strong start to conference play has allowed it to jump up in the polls.
USC will rely on back-to-back Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week and ESPNW National Player of the Week senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie to power the offense. Abercrombie has accumulated 13 kills each in wins against then-ranked No. 6 Washington and Washington State, providing a stable offensive flow for the team.
The Trojans have also received considerable offensive support from sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, senior opposite hitter Niki Withers and junior outside hitter Alyse Ford. Lanier is averaging a team-leading 4.32 kills per set on the season while Ford and Withers are averaging 2.60 kills per set and 2.35 kills per set, respectively. Setters Reni Meyer-Whalley and Cindy Marina will also look to make strong constributions in setting up opportunities for the rest of the team.
The Women of Troy will have to attempt to stop Arizona’s offense, driven by junior outside hitter Kendra Dahlke. Dahlke has accumulated 131 kills for the Wildcats and is averaging 3.12 kills per set this season. She is joined on the offensive front by freshman outside hitter Paige Whipple, sporting 2.50 kills per set, and junior outside hitter Tyler Spriggs, with a 2.86 kps, to spearhead the Wildcats’ offense. The Trojans’ defense will have its hands full in the desert against an offensively driven Wildcat squad.
After a quick one-day turnaround, the Women of Troy head out to Tempe to face the Sun Devils.
The team is led by senior middle blocker Oluoma Okaro, who has put up crazy numbers for Arizona State. Okaro has a total of 258 kills and averages 4.61 kps. Against Washington in late September, Okaro racked up 30 kills in a five-set loss. She is joined by outside hitters Ivana Jeremic and Griere Hughes to form a strong offensive line. The Sun Devils will seek to bounce back against the Trojans after enduring four consecutive losses against Pac-12 opponents.
If USC can pick up two solid wins on the road, the Trojans will move to 6-0 on the season and solidify their spot alongside Stanford in the Pac-12, who they’ll host — along with Cal — next weekend.
The Women of Troy face the Wildcats at 6 p.m. tonight and the Sun Devils at 6 p.m. on Saturday.
Good luck ladies, and don’t get caught looking past either AZ school as you head into these games. Stanford will wait.

The No. 6 USC women’s soccer team began its two-game Arizona road trip in Tucson facing Arizona on Thursday. Despite a slow start, the Trojans pulled out the 1-0 victory in a double overtime thriller headlined by a penalty kick goal from senior forward Alex Anthony.
Although the Wildcats are unranked, they were hot off a huge upset victory against No. 11 Cal. Coming into the game, Arizona knew that a win against the Trojans would most likely land them a spot in the top 25. On the other side, the Women of Troy entered the desert state coming off a fantastic weekend with two wins against a pair of Oregon teams last weekend.
Both USC and Arizona are notorious for playing a fast-paced offense while maintaining a strong back line which made for a heart-stopping contest. The Wildcats took the momentum early in the game with a pair of scoring opportunities deep into the USC zone but were rejected on both attempts.
The Trojans stole the momentum halfway through the first half with two scoring opportunities of their own. In the 32nd minute, junior forward Leah Pruitt was left alone inside the the goal area where she rifled a point-blank shot toward the Wildcats’ net but was denied by junior goalkeeper Lainey Burdett. Just a minute later, the Women of Troy threatened to score again with senior midfielder Sydney Sladek alone on the right side inside the 18-yard box, but the aggressive Arizona defense was there to stop the attempt.
Despite the high volume of scoring opportunities for both sides, the first half of the match was scoreless. At halftime, head coach Keidane McAlpine commented on his team’s scoring opportunities.
“We’ve created half-chances in and around the box, maybe have a little more composure with the passes that we are making into those plays,” McAlpine said. “But I like where we are. I think we are in a decent rhythm and we are creating quite a few chances.”
Early into the second half USC caught a break with a clutch diving save from redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins. The Women of Troy then responded with a close chance of their own in the 58th minute. On a crossbody shot from within the box, Sladek pounded the ball off the crossbar, but the ball went over the back of the net and the Wildcats regained control with the goal kick.
The remainder of the second half was a back-and-forth battle between the Trojans and Wildcats. However, neither squad was able to able to find the back of the net and the game headed to overtime. At the end of the regulation, the Women of Troy had outshot Arizona 12-3, four of which were on frame.
The Wildcats wasted no time advancing into the Trojans’ zone. In the 92nd minute, senior midfielder Cali Crisler gave the Wildcats their first scoring opportunity of overtime with a booming left foot just below the USC crossbar. However, Collins was able to tip the ball just over the top of the goal with a magnificent diving save.
The Women of Troy quickly bounced back and worked inside the Arizona defensive zone taking several shots. In the 99th minute, a tackle from behind by junior midfielder Kennedy Kieneker put Anthony in a game-defining penalty kick situation. With the game on the line, Anthony sailed the ball over the top of the net, and the contest would be extended to a second overtime.
In the 109th minute, the Trojans were fouled again within the Arizona 18-yard box and Anthony was granted her second overtime penalty kick. This time, Anthony drilled the ball into the back of the net to close off the game and grant the Trojans their third Pac-12 win over a very competitive Arizona team.
With the overtime victory, freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins tallied her fifth shutout of the season and the Women of Troy improved their overall record to 9-1-1. They will now journey 100 miles north for their Sunday matchup against Arizona State.

For the first time in a while at USC, people are staring longingly over at Westwood. The Bruins may be trending down with two losses in their last three games, but right now, UCLA has something the Trojans desperately want: a bye week.
People have been harping on USC’s lack of a midseason break since the team released its schedule in January. But what seemed like over-exaggerated preseason speculation has proved true. Injuries have significantly depleted the Trojan ranks four weeks into the season, and most recently, the team has lost senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao to a year-ending pectoral surgery.
When the team runs onto the field at the Coliseum on Saturday, it will likely be without three of its regular offensive linemen (after losing three starting linemen last spring to the NFL Draft). The Trojans’ top pass-rusher, junior linebacker Porter Gustin, remains without a timetable for return from a bicep injury, and redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhbhe hasn’t played since the season opener against Western Michigan after emerging as an oft-targeted red-zone threat last year. A host of other significant contributors are on the injury report as well, from freshman running back Stephen Carr to junior defensive lineman Rasheem Green.
Fortunately, Oregon State is in town this week — and the Beavers are the closest USC gets to a bye this season. No disrespect to Gary Andersen’s squad, but Oregon State has only won one game this fall: a 3-point victory over winless FCS outfit Portland State. Most recently, the Beavers took a four-touchdown loss to Washington State, had a bye week and then came back with a seven-touchdown drubbing at the hands of Washington. Under normal circumstances, head coach Clay Helton could take this week as an opportunity to sit any players who could use an extra week of rest. Maybe he would even get a chance to show Trojan fans a glimpse of the future, playing one of his two freshman quarterbacks.
Then again, that’s what many thought against Western Michigan on Week 1. And these aren’t normal circumstances. Not only has USC carried serious championship expectations since the start of the calendar year, but the team is also coming off its first loss of the season last Friday night. The Trojans’ deflating defeat to Washington State leaves them no margin for error over the next seven-plus weeks. They enter Saturday as whopping 34-point favorites over Oregon State, and they will have to come close to covering that spread in order to convince skeptics — undoubtedly including some on the College Football Playoff selection committee — that the loss to the Cougars was a bump in the road, not the collapse of a fatally flawed team.
So as much as Helton and his squad could use a break, they don’t have the luxury of manufacturing one this week. The Trojans may be beat-up, but the starters (especially on offense) haven’t looked fully in-sync all year and were at their worst last Friday. They need the reps on Saturday to generate some confidence and momentum with a key two-game stretch against Utah and at Notre Dame coming up next.
And no one needs a confidence boost more than redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold. Though he continues to show glimpses of the one-of-a-kind playmaking ability that catapulted him to the top of NFL draft boards, Darnold has also shown questionable decision-making this season, and he has uncharacteristically missed multiple open receivers.
Darnold’s recent struggles aren’t necessarily entirely his fault: Receivers have had trouble getting open, and the in-flux offensive line is doing him no favors, forcing Darnold to run for his life against Washington State. But no matter what is to blame, this weekend is a ripe opportunity to get back on track. USC’s very green line will have a chance to find some rhythm as a unit against an Oregon State pass rush that has averaged just 1.2 sacks per game this fall — tied for 110th in the nation. Meanwhile, a presumably better-protected Darnold will look to pick apart a unit that ranks 120th in total defense out of 129 FBS programs.
On the other side of the ball, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s unit, which ranks sixth in the country with 12 forced turnovers, will be salivating at the prospect of facing the Beavers, who are second-to-last in the FBS with 14 giveaways. Oregon State’s overall offense isn’t very intimidating, either: its mark of 321.6 yards per game ranks 112th nationally, and the team’s 21.2 points per game are good for 110th, behind winless dumpster fires like Baylor and UMass.
The Beavers deserve as much respect as any other opponent, but Saturday is undeniably a soft matchup for the Trojans. The team may not get a bye, but a cupcake conference game is the next best thing. Ideally, USC would flip on cruise control from the start and get to next week healthy and rested. Helton and company desperately need a statement victory, though — and they will need to keep their foot on the gas in order to turn heads. A three-touchdown win will be a nonfactor on the Trojans’ playoff resume. A 40-point demolition job, on the other hand, may just convince doubters to reconsider their stance.
This weekend needs to be a wake-up call, not just to USC but also to the rest of the college football world. The playoff dream is still alive — the Trojans just need to remind everyone before it’s too late.

Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein announced a $5 million scholarship foundation for female directors at USC in a statement released Thursday. The statement was made in response to a New York Times investigation detailing accusations of sexual harassment against him, spanning several decades.
Weinstein was involved in numerous sexual harassment claims throughout his career as a major producer, including at least eight settlements and accusations from film stars like Ashley Judd and Emily Nestor, according to the Times report.
“I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed,” Weinstein said in his statement. “I appreciate the way I’ve worked with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.”
Weinstein also said the scholarship foundation wasn’t a response to The Times’ findings, but had been in the works for a year. The scholarship will be named after his mother, Miriam Weinstein, who died in November 2016.
The School of Cinematic Arts confirmed that Weinstein had pledged the $5 million endowment in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.
“[We] began discussions with Mr. Weinstein over a year ago to fund a $5 million endowment in his mother’s honor dedicated to scholarships for women filmmakers, particularly those from minority communities,” USC’s statement read.
USC declined to respond when asked if the school would accept the donation and continue its relationship with Weinstein, The Hollywood Reporter said.
First Simpson, here comes Wienerstein. get that trophy and donation out of here.
Has USC Cinema responded to this yet?  They need to. The Weinstein name is being stripped from his projects. USC should be no exception.
Disgusting.
Harvey should “interview” each candidate at his home between the hours of midnight and 4 am.
It’s now Toxic money and needs to be donated to the victims of sexual abuse and assault

Boyle Heights is a familiar topic for Sanchez, the director for the Center of Democracy and Diversity and an American studies & ethnicity and history professor USC. The area has been a 20-year research project for him, and he’s currently writing a book on Boyle Heights. Sanchez worked with Lopez to create the Boyle Heights Museum last year, and selected 12 USC students — three graduates and nine undergraduates, — assist him in the project.
“The most important thing is that Boyle Heights is a fascinating community with a lot of newcomers and we felt it was important it had its own museum to tell its history,” Sanchez said. “We also felt it was a particularly important time to do it because of the pressures of gentrification helping in the community.”
The group focused their research in the archives, finding images and writing copy that reflected Boyle Heights’ diverse history. Over the summer, they traveled to Washington, D.C. to find inspiration from other museums on how to present their topic to a community divided by gentrification.
In recent years, real estate prices have risen across the Los Angeles area, making Boyle Heights a gold mine for buyers seeking relatively affordable real estate. Sanchez explains that this hurt the area’s working and lower-class residents, pricing them out of their homes and businesses. However, Sanchez thinks it’s important to understand that gentrification like this is a recurring problem.
“[In Los Angeles] there is a very long history of local and federal officials not taking rights of people that live in the community seriously,” Sanchez said. “For most of its time, the local officials have tried to change the people who have lived in Boyle Heights. There have been various efforts to segregate community and make it harder for people to own old homes.”
To showcase this history, the museum will rotate through exhibits every few months. In March, the museum will showcase its second exhibit about the 1968 student walkouts in eastern Los Angeles. Sanchez and his students will also continue to work to create additional community programming in Boyle Heights, including an event where local undocumented high school students will be able to come to the museum and share their own experiences.
Above all, Sanchez thinks the project exemplifies how all USC students, undergraduate and graduate, can assist the surrounding areas.
“At our opening, there were several people who said that [the museum] is the most incredibly example of university/community relations,” Sanchez said.
