While everyone was focused on the situation between China and the NBA over a week ago, esports had its own controversy. 
Activision Blizzard, the maker of Hearthstone, banned Chinese Hearthstone player Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai from competitive play after he verbally supported the Hong Kong protests on a Hearthstone official stream.
“Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our time,” Blitzchung said in Mandarin in an interview while wearing a gas mask and a pair of goggles. 
As his punishment, Blitzchung had to forfeit all of his current season prize earnings and was issued a year-long suspension. 
Several days after handing down the ban, Activision Blizzard issued a statement in an effort to clear the air around the actions of pro players.
“Esports exist to create opportunities for players from around the world, from different cultures, and from different backgrounds, to come together to compete and share their passion for gaming,” the statement read.
This situation shares some similarities with the recent NBA controversy of the past week. Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey received harsh criticism after he tweeted in support of the Hong Kong demonstrations. The difference: It was the Chinese government and sponsors taking action against Morey and the Rockets, the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver. Silver actually backed Morey’s right to voice his opinion.
Blizzard also stated that the content of Blitzchung’s message did not have an effect on the penalties enforced. 
Given the recent events concerning the NBA and China, that’s hard to believe.
China wants to control the narrative. Even outside the country, China can do just that through its harsh penalties for those who dare to speak against the government. 
What this likely comes down to, as everything in the modern world does, is money. Activision Blizzard has a massive player base in China, and a significant portion of its professional players are from there. Activision Blizzard needed to act fast; it did that with a snap-call ban. No warnings, no discussions, nothing.
It’s the same argument as the Colin Kaepernick kneeling situation. How much authority does the league or company have? Technically, all of it.
These are private entities, and if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell doesn’t want players kneeling during the national anthem, he can make that law if he wants to. 
In the same way, Activision Blizzard can prevent players from supporting the Hong Kong protests if it chooses to do so. It may not be morally right, but it’s not illegal.
The difference between the NBA and Activision Blizzard is that Silver backed free speech, citing that it is not the NBA’s place to police what its people say.  
Silver’s decision tells players, “We want you here for who you are.” 
Blizzard’s decision tells e-athletes, “Keep your mouth shut and play.”
“Moving forward, we will continue to apply tournament rules to ensure our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political views,” Blizzard’s statement read.
This portion of the statement sounds harsh, but the company’s intent is understandable. Foremost, Blizzard doesn’t want to look like it supports what its players say, and it is willing to limit its players to just playing the game to ensure that it doesn’t cross any boundaries. 
Blizzard made Blitzchung an example. He is an example for professional players to limit themselves to solely the game when they are “on the clock.” 
The last edition of this column discussed the importance of community within the burgeoning industry of professional esports. Blizzard’s short-fuse reaction has damaged its reputation — even though it later reduced the ban to six months and gave Blitzchung his prize money. Players shouldn’t have to look over their shoulders every time they speak their minds. 
It sounds like Blizzard will only limit what players say when they are appearing on official Blizzard content. What happens if the protests continue or grow and more players start speaking out? Does Blizzard let them do that on their own time? Will Blizzard want outspoken activists on its roster? How will it react if the Chinese government pressures it?
The answer is unknown, but Blizzard needs to make it very clear to its players what they can and cannot say and when they can and cannot say it. 
Above all, it must ensure that it doesn’t disturb or attempt to influence the gaming community.

The USC tennis teams continued to demonstrate their talent with impressive results this past weekend at separate tournaments. 
The women’s team hosted the Women of Troy Fall Invitational at Marks Stadium at USC while the men’s team travelled to Tulsa, Okla. for the Saint Francis Health Systems ITA All-American Championships. 
The women’s team’s opponents were the Loyola Marymount Lions, Iowa State Cyclones and New Mexico Lobos. The tournament spanned three days, starting Friday and concluding Sunday. 
On the first day, junior Ana Neffa, senior Sydney Van Alphen, sophomore Estella Jaeger and freshman Payton Saca all won singles matches against New Mexico. 
The opening day was full of exciting contests for the Trojans. Neffa took sophomore Sara Kuuttila-Webbert to a tiebreaker (10-6) before ultimately emerging victorious, and Jaeger also won a tightly-contested tiebreaker (10-8) over sophomore Myu Kageyama. 
On the second day, the same Trojans took on LMU with Neffa, Van Alphen and Jaeger all winning their matches. 
On Sunday, sophomore Salma Ewing joined the singles lineup, and all four Trojans beat their Iowa State opponents. Van Alphen’s match with freshman Christin Hsieh ended with a close tiebreaker round (10-8) before Van Alphen again came out on top.
In doubles play, the Trojans only faced off against New Mexico. Ewing and freshman Eryn Cayetano paired together while Jaeger and Neffa comprised the other Trojan doubles team. Both beat the Lobos Friday.
On the second day, Cayetano and Jaeger played alongside each other and lost, while Ewing and Saca were able to get a win. On the tournament’s final day, the pairs of Neffa and Van Alphen as well as Jaeger and Saca won their matches. 
Overall, USC finished with an 11-1 record in singles play and a 5-1 record in doubles competition, an outstanding result for the Trojans.
The men’s main highlight in Tulsa was a quarterfinal appearance by the elite doubles duo of sophomore Bradley Frye and senior Riley Smith. Frye and Smith are the No. 28 doubles team in the nation according to the Oracle ITA rankings. 
The Duke Blue Devils’ impressive partnership of junior Sean Sculley and senior Nick Stachowiak brought their run to an end. 
“[They had] big and important matches along the way,” said head coach Brett Masi, who acknowledged Frye and Smith’s tough opponents from the ACC. “Overall, both those boys won some key matches and did really well. We are proud of what they did.”
Sophomore Jake Sands and freshmen Ryder Jackson and Stefan Dostanic took part in singles play with Frye and Smith. Smith made it to the Round of 32 before losing to junior Alastair Gray from Texas Christian University in three sets. 
“Riley had a great week in terms of individually, in singles he won four matches, and [he] had a good chance to beat another player [Gray],” Masi said of Smith’s solid singles performance.
The Trojans will look to carry their momentum into the ITA Southwest Regional Championships. The tournament takes place at Pepperdine University for the men’s team and in San Diego for the women’s squad.

Passersby don’t tend to equate it with Saturday night football at the Coliseum, but the Spikeball nets set up on the Great Lawn at USC Village each Friday are not simply part of some big party game.
SC Spikeball Roundnet Club has developed both a social and competitive roundnet scene at USC where first-time players can compete against the University’s best.
Tucker Judkins and Tavis Cote, juniors majoring in journalism and political science with a progressive degree in communication management, respectively, started the club in 2017 to bring together USC students with an interest in roundnet.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re super good, super bad, if you’ve never played before, whatever,” Judkins said. “Everyone just goes and plays.”
Spikeball Roundnet Club meets Friday afternoons from 2 to 6 p.m., although Judkins said those interested in playing competitively stay as late as 11 p.m. and show up to the Great Lawn Tuesdays and Saturdays as well.
“We run drills first for half an hour to 45 minutes, and then we play two hours of games,” Judkins said of the competitive practices. “And then there’s a bunch of tournaments throughout the two semesters as well.”
Roundnet — better known as Spikeball, after the company that manufactures the signature nets and balls — has taken off in the last few years, garnering $6.9 million in 2015 alone. The competitive scene has also skyrocketed to include over 4 million players worldwide.
The sport borrows elements from volleyball, four square and handball. Two teams of two volley the ball to their partners and spike the ball onto the net, attempting to keep opponents from returning it.
Although the Spikeball product was initially marketed as a toy when it was introduced in 1989, roundnet has become a serious sport with a large competitive scene that has struggled to gain exposure. Spikeball creator Chris Ruder severed ties with “Shark Tank” investor Daymond John because John wanted to partner with Marvel to create a Spiderman-branded set, which Ruder believed would undermine roundnet’s status as a sport.
Many players — Judkins included — were first introduced to roundnet as a game rather than a competitive sport.
“I was on a road trip with some friends … and [my friend’s] mom bought him a Spikeball set, and so we just took it with us,” Judkins said. “We didn’t know the rules, we didn’t know what we were doing and we didn’t have enough people to play. And so we were just hitting this ball on the net and just trying to keep it going, and we just thought it was so much fun.”
Because roundnet’s competitive scene is still relatively small, Judkins said opposing teams constantly tell each other how to get better in order to improve the entire playing field. 
“If I was playing baseball … and I fielded a ground ball wrong, if my opponent sees I did that, they’re going to laugh because they’re not trying to help me get better. They want to beat me,” Judkins said. “In Spikeball, in order for the sport itself to actually grow, everybody collectively has to get better so that we can get more exposure as people become better athletes … Everybody just picks each other up and teaches each other on the go.”
Unlike in most sports, roundnet teams do not have formal coaches. As one of USC’s more experienced players, Judkins takes on that coaching role, teaching others the correct form and technique.
Roundnet is expanding not just across college campuses but around the world. In September 2020, Belgium will host the Spikeball Roundnet World Championship, an international tournament that will include both an individual team and a national team championship.
The individual team competition consists of teams of two players representing the same country and will include divisions for different levels of player — advanced, intermediate, beginner and women’s divisions.
In the national team competition, squads composed of the top five men’s and top three women’s teams in each country will compete, and the winner will be determined based on the squad’s overall performance.
Judkins will apply to compete in Belgium within the next few months. Anthony Winney, a freshman majoring in mathematics, is also looking to compete and may apply to play alongside Judkins.
Although the international tournament setting is new, players have been competing in roundnet at the national level for years. Judkins has traveled as far as Dallas and Salt Lake City for tournaments.
While the opportunity to compete is certainly enticing to players, the gameplay itself isn’t what keeps players coming back for more.
“Roundnet seems to attract people who [are] extremely genuine individuals and people who are really willing to make themselves vulnerable, and they’re down to earth,” Judkins said. “I’ve found a lot of people like that in the roundnet community, and that’s one of the things I really love about roundnet.”
Unlike many college sports in which players strictly compete against other colleges, members of SC Spikeball Roundnet Club compete both against and alongside players from other schools, creating a tight-knit community of players that extends beyond campus boundaries.
As roundnet continues to pick up speed both nationally and internationally, the future of the sport is unclear — raising the question of whether it could become a Division I sport or even an Olympic sport at some point.
“I think that roundnet could end up in the Olympics, legitimately,” Judkins said. “I think that’s a goal that a lot of people in the roundnet community have. I’m not really sure if there’s a better end goal for a sport than reaching the Olympics, so that’s what I would hope for.”

Both USC and Arizona look to regain their footing Saturday when they face off at 6:30 p.m. in the Coliseum.
USC (3-3, 2-1 in the Pac-12) will be coming off back-to-back losses to No. 25 Washington and No. 8 Notre Dame. Not only is this USC’s homecoming weekend, but it is also a true homecoming for the Trojans, having been away from the Coliseum for four weeks now. This bodes well, given that USC is undefeated at home this season. USC has also won its last six games against Arizona (4-2, 2-1 in the Pac-12), and have dropped just two games to the Wildcats since 2001. 
Redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Jay Tufele expressed a sentiment that seemed to say it wasn’t the Irish who won Saturday’s game but the Trojans who lost it. 
“Everyone’s spirit is up. There were three games that all had the same thing in common, just minor mistakes,” he said. “I don’t think it was anything big. It was just us. We hurt ourselves. When we start rolling and when this team starts going, I think we can be the best in the country.” 
Undoubtedly, fundamentals and executing properly will be a focus for the Trojans in this upcoming game. 
The Trojans and their Air Raid offense were able to move the ball well on Saturday. Their downfall though, as freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis said postgame, was execution. USC will undoubtedly be looking to capitalize on the opportunities it creates for itself in this upcoming game against the Wildcats. Conversely, Arizona is ranked third in the Pac-12 in third-down conversion rate at 46.84%.
Arizona is the No. 9 offense in the nation by yardage, with 3,056 yards under its belt so far. USC’s weakness has been the defense, which allowed the Irish to run for 308 rushing yards. The Trojan offense chugged along, putting up 426 total yards, but they’ll continue to struggle this weekend unless they get their defense under control. However, USC’s offensive attack will likely meet little resistance from Arizona, which ranks No. 11 in pass defense out of the 12 teams that make up the Pac-12. 
Unlike USC’s offense, led by newcomer Slovis, Arizona is led by a third-year starter. Senior quarterback Khalil Tate threw his 53rd career touchdown pass last weekend against Washington, putting him just 14 touchdowns away from tying the school record of 67. 
But despite inching closer to a record on Saturday, Tate did not look like the veteran he is. He completed just 52% of his passes and was sacked four times. It’ll be a toss-up whether Tate has another poor performance or if he’ll bring the heat against the Trojans as he did versus Colorado two weeks ago. 
The loss of redshirt junior tailback Vavae Malepeai, who underwent knee surgery Tuesday, will be a big hit to the Trojans. The surgery will clear out swelling that has caused him soreness all season. In Malepeai’s absence, offensive coordinator Graham Harrell emphasized keeping redshirt freshman tailback Markese Stepp and junior tailback Stephen Carr fresh with touches. 
This upcoming game will be USC’s first of six straight conference matchups and a stepping stone on the path to head coach Clay Helton’s goal of capturing the Pac-12 title. There is little room for continued error in this coming stretch. 
“I think we’re at least as good as each and every team we’ve played,” Helton said. “We got a tremendous opportunity to go try to win six games and try to get back to Santa Clara.” 
The Trojans host Arizona at 6:30 p.m. Saturday.
