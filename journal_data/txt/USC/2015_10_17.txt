The Trojans rallied from an early deficit to reclaim the lead in the third quarter but ultimately fell up short to No. 14-ranked Notre Dame, 41-31, on Saturday night.
Interim head coach Clay Helton drops to 0-1 at the helm since taking over for Steve Sarkisian earlier this week.
“I told the team with every fiber of my being, every fiber, that I truly believe this is a good football team that can be great, but we have to eliminate the mistakes,” Helton said.
USC (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12), which hasn’t beaten the Fighting Irish (6-1) in South Bend since 2011, entered the fourth quarter tied with its rival at 31-31, but it gave up back-to-back 90-yard touchdown drives to the Irish on its way to being outscored 17-0 in the final quarter.
Notre Dame’s 41 points is the most scored against any USC team since 1977.
Despite racking up 590 yards of total offense, the Trojans didn’t have an answer for the Notre Dame rushing attack, which accounted for 214 of the Irish’s 476 yards of total offense.

“It is disappointing,” redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “It is not like the effort was not there. It was just when it got down to the end of the game, during crucial points, we did not finish and execute.”
Senior running back C.J. Prosise carried the ball 19 times for 143 yards and two touchdowns on the night.
In the air, Notre Dame’s sophomore quarterback Deshone Kizer completed 15 of 24 passes on his way to throwing for 227 yards and two touchdowns.
Junior wide receiver Will Fuller was on the other end of a 75-yard touchdown pass from Kizer on the Irish’s first play from scrimmage. Fuller caught only three passes on the night but was still able to go off for 131 yards receiving.
“C.J. and Fuller, they are tremendous football players,” Helton said. “They did a great job of winning their one-on-one matchups, especially in the deep ball.”
Fuller’s touchdown reception quickly answered USC’s seven points on its first drive of the game, which came on a three-yard rush by Kessler.
Coming off one of the worst performances of his career, Kessler thew for 365 yards and two touchdowns on 30-of-46 passing but threw two timely interceptions that hurt USC in the fourth quarter.

“Those turnovers late were crucial, especially when you play a good football team like that,” Kessler said.
After trailing 24-10 in the second quarter, the Trojans responded with two consecutive scoring drives to tie the game at 24.
Helton brought out a play from the trick book when he dialed up a reverse pass that had former quarterback and redshirt freshman wide receiver Jalen Greene throwing a 75-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who caught for 139 yards on six receptions.
Sophomore Adoree’ Jackson also got involved on offense when he connected with Kessler and jetted off for an 83-yard touchdown.
The Trojans had a chance to take a lead into halftime, but a 36-yard kick off the leg of redshirt junior Alex Wood hammered off of the upright.
USC carried its momentum into the second half and reclaimed a seven-point lead on a four-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt junior tight end Taylor McNamara. USC, however, would be shutout for the rest of the game.
“I felt like we had the momentum, but we couldn’t stop the inside zone,” junior linebacker Su’a Cravens said.
Penalties also continued to hurt USC, which committed 10 on the night for 105 yards.
“At the end of the day mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense,” Helton said.
Before the game, Athletic Director Pat Haden felt light headed on the sidelines and was taken to the locker room. Haden was taken to a local hospital and checked out fine before heading back to Los Angeles on a private plane, according to a USC official.
Haden has been under an increased amount of fire since announcing the termination of former head coach Steve Sarkisian last Monday.
The Trojans return home to resume Pac-12 conference play against No. 4-ranked Utah next Saturday.

Jackie Mayuga | Daily Trojan
I was thrown into the middle of the bottomless ocean that is the coffee drinker’s lifestyle headfirst and I, unfortunately, cannot swim. Augie’s Coffee House was one of the first places I visited when I let coffee into my life, and it has been to only one I’ve loved enough to go back more times than I’m proud to admit. Unless you’re an Inland Empire native or a true coffee aficionado, you’re probably unfamiliar with what might actually be the greatest coffee roaster in Southern California.
Nestled in the quiet corners of the exposed brick and neutral tones of historic downtown Redlands, the bright red façade of the original location of Augie’s Coffee House still stands. It’s as red as both the Redlands and the espresso-rich blood running through my veins. Perhaps a slight exaggeration, but you get it.
I have no idea what the building was used for before the graces of the coffee gods blessed little old Redlands with a cozy coffee corner, but the layout is kind of weird. There’s a “front” room: standard chairs, tables, pastry displays and product shelf, among others things and a more open and inviting “back room” that houses long picnic benches rather than isolated tables. Because this location is in a suburban, university area, there’s free, ample parking, free, protected Wi-Fi, and free, abundant outlets. Basically, they do everything right.
In addition to the Redlands storefront there are Claremont and Riverside locations.
The Claremont spot is the one I visit most often. I’ve gone through nine loyalty cards at this location alone, and I’m only slightly ashamed to say that I’ve driven my roommates and me there from campus just to get my hands on a shot of Augie’s espresso. These guys are perched in the Claremont Packing House in downtown Claremont and share a suite with à la minute, a stellar liquid nitrogen ice cream shop that also got its start in Redlands. Outlets and seating teeter towards the “hard to find” realm, but that’s entirely dependent on the time of day and whether or not the Claremont colleges are in their exam season.
I don’t frequent the Riverside site as often as I used to primarily because it’s out of the way and my coffee-appreciating UC Riverside friends have either graduated or transferred.
Something unique about Augie’s is that, as I haven’t been able to experience from other multi-location coffee shops, they pull a super consistent shot of espresso. I can hit up any site and be confident that the drink I get won’t suck. In fact, the two shots of their Tres Narinos Espresso Blend I ordered for the road was so heart eyes emoji, it made the two hours I spent in traffic almost bearable. Because I’ve been to each Augie’s multiple times, I’ve had the chance to taste nearly everything on the menu at least once, and they’ve been memorable every single time. They also boast a variety of seasonal drinks alongside their permanent staples, and I am essentially in love with all of them. 
Clearly, I could go on and on about how I basically spent two months living off of the surprisingly delicate Lavender Vanilla Latte; how many loyalty cards I’ve annihilated between the three locations; how the combination of Augie’s espresso and à la minute vanilla ice cream makes for the holy grail of all affogatos; how the perfect ratio of perfectly roasted espresso, cinnamon and pumpkin is the reason their Pumpkin Spice Latte goes unrivaled; or how I will only ever used Augie’s roasted coffee in my Hario V60 and French press, but they’re just something any hardcore coffee consumer needs to experience themselves.
Sidenote: They also have the nicest/least pretentious baristas I’ve ever (literally, e v e r) gotten to interact with. They’ve given me L.A. recommendations and ask for updates whenever I revisit, so shoutout to all of them!
Check them out and let me know how you like them.

If there’s anything we can learn from Fashion Week runways around the world, it’s that fringe is (once again) having a moment. High fashion designers like Chanel and Proenza Schouler reintroduced us to the allure of the shredded edge last fall, and the trend has stood its ground ever since. But nobody’s complaining as this nod to the ’70s is one of the most fun trends to wear — anyone who’s twirled around in a fringe dress can confirm that. This fall, you’ll find fringe on the hemlines of skirts, edges of jackets and carefully placed on shoes and accessories. It adds life and movement to any outfit, and is a simple trick to looking undeniably cool. Here are four ways to incorporate this playful trend into your outfits this fall:
1. The Jacket
A fringe jacket is the perfect way to add an edgy flair to any look. Wear this versatile piece with jeans and a casual tee, or dress it up with a sleek dress or modern skirt. Stores like Forever 21 and H&M are fully stocked with variations of this fun jacket. While black is a popular choice, you’ll find them in other neutral tones such as gray and beige as well — a great way to mix it up.
Forever21 Fringe Jacket $54.90
2. The Skirt
It’s no surprise that Zara has a killer selection of fringe pieces to shop from this fall. This navy skirt is a super fun staple perfect for any occasion. Wear it with a structured top or sweater and pair it with booties for a super chic look — and by all means, dance around in it!
Zara Fringe Skirt $35.90
3. The Clutch
An all-time favorite of mine, a fringed clutch should be your go-to piece to add flair and personality to a dressier look. Make it the focus of your outfit by carrying it as a pop of color, and pair it with neutral and minimalist pieces to keep it in the spotlight. For those who are hesitant about wearing such a bold trend, accessorizing with a fringed bag can be a great way to try it out.
Zara Fringe Clutch $49.90
4. The Bootie
A fringe bootie is a must-have this fall.  It gives a unique edge to the classic shoe we all know and adore. I love the detail on these Topshop booties; the fringe is subtle yet makes such a big difference. Wear them to class or out to dinner with friends – they’ll go with just about anything, so have fun with it.
Topshop Fringed Bootie $150.00

USC students know the meaning of “work hard, play hard.” Courtesy of Flickr/CreativeCommons
As USC students we have learned the importance of time management to be successful in the classroom, but time management goes beyond juggling all your class assignments. It is important to juggle both your school and social life.
College students are constantly balancing life’s priorities. Though the thought of going out with your friends is a little more tempting than studying the phases of the moon for your astronomy midterm, you shouldn’t let studying take away from your happiness — or at least not all the time.  
Let’s think about economics for a minute. Even if you have not taken an economics class, there is one important concept called the law of diminishing returns. Let’s use this concept in terms of studying. After about three hours of studying for your physics exam, you cannot function as well as you did at the beginning. This means that eventually you will need to take a break in order to re-energize. This is a perfect opportunity to hangout with your friends or a significant other. Take a break with your friends by going to get lunch, workout or watch your favorite television show. It will make that last stretch of studying much easier to get through.
Now, there are certainly times where my friends and I are all so busy with schoolwork and extracurricular activities that we do not have time to do an all-day activity together, like going to beach. However, remember that study breaks can be short and sweet — and can involve just leaving the library for a quick coffee break with a friend. If it’s really crunch time and you do not have time to take a study break, then go on a study date. This way you can bond with your friends at your favorite coffee shop or study spot while still being productive. Furthermore, studying will be more enjoyable if you have your best friend sitting next to you as you try to digest the complexity of organic chemistry. This way, you’ll also have someone there for support because we all know that studying all day at a library can make you go a little stir crazy.
If you get too distracted studying with friends, then use seeing your friends as a reward for finishing studying, or at least getting to a certain point in your notes. This can be a good motivator, and it’s nice to have something to look forward to like some quality time with your friends making dinner, going to a bar or playing video games.
Another gesture that can go a long way is turning your friend’s stressful day around by doing something sweet for them. You can brighten their day by getting them a venti Starbucks latte for an extra boost of energy or by sending a “good luck on your test” text message. If you are the one having a stressful week it is important to communicate with your friends so that they know not tempt you with a Netflix marathon.
Remember that your friends are there to lean on. All of us know that school gets stressful, especially during midterm season. You cannot get out of studying for your exams so make it more enjoyable by going through the pain of studying with your friends! One of my favorite memories is when my sorority sisters and I created songs in order to memorize all the different parts of the brain for one of our general education courses. Make sure to keep up with your studies but have an active social life too. These are the friends who will stick with you even after graduation, because we are all part of the Trojan Family.
