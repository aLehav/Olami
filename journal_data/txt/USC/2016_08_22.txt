The class of 2020, transfer students, and others new to USC had their first opportunity to attend a university-wide event at the annual USC Welcome Back Concert, which took place on Saturday in McCarthy Quad.
The show was headlined by Mike Will Made It and LANY, and there were guest appearances from iLoveMakonnen, Lil Dicky, Jeremih and Eearz.
The concert was hosted by the Concert Committee, and although the official numbers for this year have not been released, last year’s concert drew 5,000 attendees.
“[For] freshmen, this is most likely their first big event on campus,” said Concert Committee Associate Director Caitlin Harriford. “We get the opportunity to hopefully bring in an artist that they are familiar with and enjoy.”
To warm up the crowd, the first performance was by LANY, a pop band based out of Los Angeles.
They were named one of Rolling Stone’s “10 New Artists to Know.” The group performed for about 45 minutes during their set.
This year, the event was headlined by Mike Will Made It. Mike Will, an Atlanta based producer, is known as one of the most successful producers in the music industry, particularly rap. The list of collaborating artist include Rihanna, Gucci Mane, Kanye West and Future among many others.
Mike Will has also had 23 songs chart on the Billboard Hot 100, including “We Can’t Stop” by Miley Cyrus, “No Flex Zone” by Rae Sremmurd and “Formation” by Beyoncé.
During the performance, Mike Will brought out four acts to perform along with him. The first act was Eearz, who is signed under Mike Will’s record label Ear Drummer Records.
Lil Dicky followed up with a performance of his hit song “Save Dat Money.” The crowd took very well to the Philadelphia native as he ended up freestyling toward the end of his performance.
The third performance was by iLoveMakonnen, a Los Angeles-born and Atlanta-based rapper, who performed his hit songs “Tuesday” and “Swerve.” iLoveMakonnen also debuted a newer song off his latest mixtape, titled Red Trap Dragon.
Finally, Jeremih came on to perform his hit songs “773 Love,” “Don’t Tell ‘Em” and “Planez” to end the hour and a half-long performance.
Attendees such as Xavier Garcia, a junior majoring in neuroscience, were surprised by the lineup and pleased with the way the concert turned out.
“I am a fan of [iLoveMakonnen] particularly so it was great to see him for free,” Garcia said. “I was not sure who to expect since I knew that Mike Will was a producer. I heard some rumors but they didn’t turn out the way I thought.”
Others, such as Nate Repasky, a sophomore majoring in business administration and accounting, thought that bringing on lesser-known artists was a poor choice.
“I had no clue who the first artist was at all,” Repasky said. “The second was better, but we could afford better names than we did.”

Former USC quarterback Todd Marinovich was arrested for possession of marijuana after police found him naked in a backyard in Irvine, according to the Orange County Register.
Police reportedly received a call around 9 p.m. last Friday about a naked man on the Venta Spur Trail, and found Marinovich in a backyard nearby.
The 47-year-old was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of marijuana and trespassing. According to police, he was carrying the items in a brown bag.
Marinovich, who spent two years at USC, started at quarterback in 1989 — his freshman season — becoming the first freshman to do so since World War II. 
A talented high school recruit, Marinovich was pressed into action right away with the Trojans after starting quarterback Pat O’Hara suffered an injury. Marinovich led USC to a 9-2-1 record and a Rose Bowl victory in 1990. 
He has had numerous incidents involving drugs throughout his playing career, including an arrest for possession of cocaine shortly after the Sun Bowl in 1990. 
Drafted ahead of Brett Favre by the Los Angeles Raiders in the first round in 1991, Marinovich again struggled with drug addiction and was released before the 1993 season. 
Marinovich never played in the NFL again, and a brief stint in the American Football League in 2000 with the Los Angeles Avengers was derailed after he was arrested for possession of heroin. 
Marinovich continued to run into trouble with drugs and the law following his football career, with incidents in 2004, 2005 and 2007. In recent years, he has made attempts to clean up his image, starting a career in art. 
In 2011, he told TMZ that he had been sober for three years. An ESPN documentary titled The Marinovich Project that same year chronicled the quarterback’s fall from grace. In part, it described how Marinovich’s father, Marv, worked relentlessly on turning his son into a “perfect” quarterback.
Last year, Marinovich spoke with the Daily Trojan on a story about concussions. He admitted that he suffered from concussions during his career and described his feelings after former teammates Junior Seau and Scott Ross passed away. 
“Something broke in them,” Marinovich said. “We need to figure out how to keep these players from being broken.”
In 2014, Marinovich reflected on his career struggles to the Los Angeles Times.
“If I make it to my 70s,” Marinovich said, “I will be surprised.”

Redshirt freshman long snapper Jake Olson will be featured in a global campaign for Foundation Fighting Blindness. Olson suffers from retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the retina that caused him to lose his left eye when he was 10 months old and his right one at the age of 12.
The campaign, #HowEyeSeeIt, is the first digital campaign for the foundation with the goal of raising funds to cure blindness caused by retinal diseases.
Olson is one of many featured in the campaign who suffers from a retinal disease. The campaign will promote fundraising through videos in which individuals do something they love blindfolded and then nominating three more people to do the same thing.
As the world’s largest private funder of research for cures of blindness, the foundation has raised $700 million to support research and create a new medial subfield. Foundation Fighting Blindness has also helped 100 children see for the first time through clinical trials and is helping create the bionic retina to help restore vision.
As his part of the campaign, Olson blindfolds other members of the football team and teaches them to snap and kick. 
Other members of the campaign include chefs Tim Love and 2012 MasterChef winner Christine Ha, Orange is the New Black actress Diane Guerrero and Harry Shum  Jr., actor and dancer from Glee.
The campaign will continue as videos are shared on the internet. The campaign also asks that in addition to sharing the video, each participants also donates to the foundation.

USC women’s soccer played two games over the weekend, traveling to Northern California for their season’s first competitive match and then returning to McAlister Field on Sunday for their second exhibition of the early fall.
The Women of Troy were ranked No. 11 in the nation in the preseason NSCAA Coaches poll; the team fell at Santa Clara before defeating Beijing Normal University in a friendly.
USC got off to a fast start against the Broncos on Friday thanks to redshirt junior Alex Anthony, who was making her first appearance for the Women of Troy after transferring from the University of Maryland this fall. Anthony set the single-season scoring record for the Terrapins last year, bagging ten goals, and she continued her lethal form in Cardinal and Gold, pouncing on a loose ball in the penalty box to give USC a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute.
But sophomore Janae Gonzalez equalized for Santa Clara in the 37th minute, as the forward got on the end of a cross and fired past redshirt senior Sammy Jo Prudhomme in the Trojan net. USC would not respond until midway through the second half, when Anthony secured a brace in an impressive debut. The striker shed her defender and slotted home in the 62nd minute to push the Women of Troy back in front. She nearly completed a hat trick late in the game but was denied by the crossbar.
The miss would prove costly, as the Broncos tied things up again in the dying minutes. Senior Jordan Jesolva smashed in the equalizer just minutes before the end of regulation. A Kelly Peay golden goal seven minutes into overtime completed the Santa Clara comeback, as Anthony defender turned a cross past Prudhomme to send the Women of Troy home with an 0-1 record to start the season.
USC rebounded strongly two days later, however, running up the score in a friendly against Beijing Normal. The Women of Troy returned to their home field and redshirt senior Katie Johnson opened the scoring in the 16th minute with her second goal in two exhibition matches. Johnson missed the entire 2015 season rehabbing an injury, but she has reestablished herself as a mainstay in the Trojan frontline after starting throughout her first three college seasons.
Junior Sydney Johnson doubled USC’s advantage less than three minutes later (and two minutes after entering the game as a substitute). A 44th-minute goal from freshman Taylor McMorrow all but buried Beijing Normal by halftime. But the Women of Troy weren’t done: Redshirt freshman Olga Langenskiöld scored for the first time in a USC jersey to make it 4-0 minutes after the second-half restart. Langenskiöld then netted her second near the hour mark to round out the Trojan scoring. Beijing Normal grabbed a late consolation goal to deny Prudhomme the clean sheet, but USC saw out a comfortable 5-1 victory.
“It was good to get back on the field after Friday’s loss to get back in rhythm and sync,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “Once we settled into the game, I thought we had a great performance. I am extremely happy with the group that came in the second half and continued to play. Olga was on fire today, and I am really happy for her. Hopefully we can build on this moving into next week’s games.”
The Women of Troy hope the exhibition win generates some momentum after the disappointment against Santa Clara. The team has no more warm-up fixtures left on its schedule and now begins the regular season with trips to Long Beach and Malibu over the weekend. USC will look for the first win of the season against Long Beach State and Pepperdine, and the Women of Troy’s first match of the week kicks off at 7 p.m. on Friday night at Long Beach.

With the lights shining down in Arlington Saturday night as the USC football team takes the field for the first game of their season, it won’t be just any other game. Across the field, the top-ranked, defending national champions will be eyeing down the Trojans. Many are anticipating No. 20 USC to lose to Alabama. Even if the Trojans pull off an upset, it would only be the first notch in their season-long uphill battle of a schedule.
Playing the Tide gives USC one of the most-anticipated first games in recent years. In the past six seasons, the Trojans opened their season against Hawaii University three times: Minnesota, Fresno State and Arkansas State. To say the Cowboy Classic is a big game would be an understatement.
Despite facing off against Alabama to kickoff their season, USC has had a bit of a quiet preseason in comparison to recent program history. In contrast to recent years, the biggest news preceding the start of the season was not a player lying to the University nor was it an intoxicated, profanity-filled speech from a head coach in front of donors and board members.
What everyone just wanted to know before the 2016 season was who would be named the starting quarterback: redshirt junior Max Browne or redshirt freshman Sam Darnold? The only real common denominator between this season and past seasons is that USC has a new coach at the reigns.
Having a new head coach is not a new situation for the Trojans. In the last six seasons, four different men have led the team, which is only a slight indication of the turmoil USC has experienced. A fresh start is exactly what the Trojans need. This fresh start, though, comes in a tough package.
Whether or not the Trojans come out on top after their matchup with the Tide, what lies ahead of them is just as daunting. It’s almost a consensus that USC has the toughest schedule in 2016.
Their schedule is bookended by two huge national opponents — No. 1 Alabama and No. 10 Notre Dame — and filled in by tough Pac-12 competition, where no win is guaranteed, no matter the opponent.
This tough schedule puts the Trojans in a unique position. They have the opportunity to vault themselves back in the national spotlight in a positive manner and not because of scandals and drama off the field and behind the scenes. It’s a nice break from the national headlines coming out of USC the past few season.
Now, back to ’Bama. If USC manages to upset the defending champions, that in no way guarantees a trip to the College Football Playoff. Because USC has the toughest schedule in the nation this season, they’ll have to go probably at least 10-2 — maybe 9-3 — to have a shot at the playoffs.
If there were ever a USC way of regaining a place as one of the top programs nationwide, doing it with the toughest schedule of the season would be that way.

Photo courtesy of WikicommonsShining gold · Allyson Felix cemented her legacy in Rio, winning two more gold medals. Her nine total medals are the most in Trojan history.
The Trojans had another favorable showing at the highest level of competition after USC-affiliated athletes won 21 medals in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, including nine golds
With the most recent medals, USC remains as the U.S. university leader in medals won with 309. Trojan athletes have now won a medal in every Summer Olympics since 1912. It is the third consecutive Games in which USC athletes have won at least 20 medals.
USC was represented in Rio by 44 current, former or incoming Trojans, and it was the fifth consecutive Summer Olympics that more than 40 athletes have represented USC.
Highlights from the first week at the Olympics included swimmer Katinka Housszu of Hungary who captured three gold medals and one silver medal in her fourth Olympic games. She set the USC record for most individual medals in a single Olympics.
Also making history was former basketball player DeMar DeRozan, who became the first Trojan to bring home a gold medal in men’s basketball when the U.S. men’s team captured the gold.
Allyson Felix, the U.S. track star in her fourth Olympic games, won two gold medals and one silver medal. Her nine career medals and six golds make her the Trojan athlete with the most gold medals, most overall medals and the most decorated U.S. female track athlete of all time.
Also on the track, Andre De Grasse of Canada won three medals, taking home one silver and two bronzes. Dalilah Muhhammad took home a gold medal in the 400m hurdles to become the first American woman to win gold in the event.
Former USC water polo players Kami Craig and Kaleigh Gilchrist won gold, becoming part of the first country to win back-to-back gold medals. It was Craig’s third career medal.
At Copa Cabana, former beach volleyball player April Ross won her second career medal after taking home bronze with partner Kerri Walsh-Jennings.
USC track athletes took home nine total medals, the most ever in a single Olympics. Nine of the track participants were current or incoming Trojans.

It can’t be true. Was it really 50 years ago I moved into Town & Gown as a freshman? Growing up in Palo Alto, I always knew I wanted to attend college in Los Angeles. Little did I know that, in 1966, I’d begin my love affair with USC in particular and Southern California in general.
Many of my best friends were made my freshman year. In the dorm, there were about a dozen of us who hung out in each other’s rooms, made midnight burrito runs together, and shared class notes. Seven of us pledged Kappa Sigma on the same night. Just last April, more than 70 of my fraternity brothers and I celebrated our 40th annual BS Open — a weekend of great story-telling and so-so golf.
Life back in ’66 was very different than it is today. The Beatles still were touring, Lyndon Johnson was president, and only a handful of my Trojan classmates knew where Vietnam was. We lived in a bubble back then. Even though Notre Dame beat us 51-0 that fall, ’SC went on to appear in four straight Rose Bowls beginning in 1967.
(Speaking of football, two events from my undergraduate days are etched into my memory. The first was O.J. Simpson’s dramatic 64-yard run against UCLA to win the annual cross-town rivalry, and the second was the NFL launching what eventually would become known as the Super Bowl. Both took place across the street in the Coliseum.)
What also was taking place in those days was a steady escalation of the war in Vietnam. It was the first time Americans could see the effects of war on TV almost as they were happening. The end result was a nation torn apart for years.
Most of my fraternity brothers believed it was vital we fight communism in Southeast Asia. Only a handful disagreed. All that came to a head on Dec. 1, 1969, when the U.S. held its first Vietnam-era draft lottery for young men over 18. I was a senior then, and “won” the lottery that night. Yes, my date of birth was the first picked.
The world my friends and I lived in half a century ago and the world you have inherited are similar, but very different. First, I don’t think ’SC ever will appear in four straight Rose Bowls again; second, there is a real possibility you can elect our first female president this November; and third, CNN has changed the way we view world events in real time. It’s both a troubling time but an exciting time to be a freshman on campus.
Last April, when my Kappa Sigma fraternity brothers and I met as a group, we talked a lot about our kids and grandchildren (some of whom may be your ’SC classmates now.) We also talked about the “good old days.” Even though several of them are 70 now, I can tell you there still is a lot of vigor left in their old bones.
So, to you freshman who are just beginning your journey as a Trojan, I wish you well. Take time to make friends and study hard. Both will serve you well in the years and decades ahead. I ought to know. The last 50 years have gone by in a flash. I’m so grateful my ’SC friends from 1966 still are my friends today.
Fight On!

Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
In a year when Republican Presidential Nominee Donald Trump has secured white Americans’ fear of a diversifying nation into a national campaign, where rhetoric alienating people of color has been thrown into a public arena, many thought this fall’s The Birth of a Nation, depicting the unlikely success of an African American during the nineteenth century, might be a national reckoning.
This was before the country learned that the film’s star and director, Nate Parker, had allegedly raped a woman when he was a college student at Penn State University. Parker’s roommate, Jean Celestin, had allegedly raped the same woman, and that four years ago, Parker and Celestin’s victim had committed suicide. Celestin went on to co-write The Birth of a Nation. The question emerges of whether or not it is still ethical to view the film.
A strict answer is not available, because that would be as complicated as the situation itself. Audiences should not purchase tickets to The Birth of a Nation with the notion that they will help Parker and Celestin, that they appreciate their creativity, their individual personality. Anyone who watches The Birth of a Nation should be doing so because the content is important, because the content is relevant and because the history of people of color is one so rarely told in the realm of cinema. It is going to be up to the individual to decide if he or she can stand not to reconcile the film with the filmmaker, a qualm that seems to plague audiences time and time again.
This story is tragic and angering, and by far one of the most complicated and situations for a national movie-going audience to process. It may no longer be ethical to watch The Birth of a Nation in theaters, when the movie is released this October. We should not pay to watch a movie that promises to be one of the most important of the year, if it means our tickets will fund two alleged rapists. And we would not still be asking ourselves these questions if The Birth of a Nation was just a flimsy summer blockbuster, not a movie about slavery and diversity, one so relevant to the national conversation we have today.
Of course, it all comes down to whether or not we can, and should, separate the artist (in this case, artists) from the work. The situation changes when money, our money, is thrown into the mix. Critics praised Parker for the film and his supposed reconstruction of American identity (the title for The Birth of a Nation is a response to the 1915 film of the same name, which features racist portrayals of Black people).
And yet, lauding of Parker for his efforts to promote the history of people of color necessarily factors him into the equation; if one can praise an artist for thinking up this material, must they also not decry him for allegedly thinking it was acceptable, 17 years ago, to rape and abuse a woman? This is complicated by the fact that if you watch the trailer for this film, there is a clear reference to the sexual abuse of black women by white slave owners. So here are Parker and Celestin, each alleged rapists, attempting a commentary on sexual assault in the age of slavery.
We must respond.
Parker and Celestin are hardly the only people to work on this movie. And a great majority of these people have not been accused of rape. Again, here is the trouble: Parker writes, directs and stars in the movie. It is very much his film, derived almost entirely from him.
The rape that Parker and Celestin have been accused of is 17 years old, and the woman who accused them has taken her own life. She is gone, and Parker and Celestin have become internationally renowned filmmakers. The history of college sexual assault is a long and despicable one, where more often than not, the rapist walks free. But the art is in a historical and racial narrative.
This cannot alter the events of 17 years ago, but if Parker is as “devastated” as he claims to be, then he and Celestin should take the resources that have come into their possession and make tangible change.
It is the least they can do.

Allen Pham | Daily TrojanSweet stuff · Former USC starting quarterback Matt Leinart (center-right) poses with USC Hospitality staff at the opening of the Sprinkles ATM at the Pertusati Bookstore Monday. The machine is the result of months of work by USC Hospitality to find a local vendor.
Dozens of students and faculty members stood in line at the Pertusati Bookstore Monday morning for the grand opening of USC’s newest commodity, the Sprinkles Cupcake ATM.
Sprinkles is popular both within the L.A. community and nationwide for its handcrafted treats containing no preservatives, trans fat or artificial flavors. The company is also credited by the Los Angeles Times to have started the “haute cupcake craze.”
After several months of searching for local partnerships, USC Hospitality successfully procured an agreement with L.A.-based cupcake giant Sprinkles.
A myriad of USC Hospitality workers and media members gathered around at 10 a.m. to introduce the on-campus ATM machine. At the event, USC alum and former quarterback, Matt Leinart, had the honor to be the ATM’s first customer, and Genesis Gomez Tello, a first-year graduate at the USC School of Social Work, won an Instagram contest hosted by USC Hospitality to be the first student to purchase from the cupcake machine. Customers also had the opportunity to win one of the ten $100 gift cards to Sprinkles that were placed in random boxes in the ATM.
Open 24 hours, the new ATM machine will allow students to purchase Sprinkles cupcakes on campus at any time of the day. Holding up to 800 cupcakes, the dispensary boasts a large selection of flavors and options, including specialty cupcakes to accommodate dietary needs. The machine will also be regularly restocked from Sprinkles’ FIGat7th shop to ensure that the ATM is accessible at all times of the day.
Because of its popularity among college students, many at the University have expressed their support for the business.
“A lot of students and community members are going to come to USC for Sprinkles because it is a lot more accessible than going to Figat7th, The Americana or The Grove,” said Tello. “It’s just great knowing that we can just get a cupcake at our convenience.”
The partnership between the University and the bakery has satisfied students’ sweets cravings and has also supported USC Hospitality’s aims to provide fresh food products from local sources to the Trojan community. The company’s executive chef, Eric Ernest, states that Sprinkles cupcakes don’t contain any preservatives or fillers and are made from “chef-driven, transparent” recipes.
This is a significant move for the cupcake company as well. Though Sprinkles unveiled its first cupcake ATM in 2012, the USC Sprinkles ATM is the cupcake shop’s first standalone ATM, a vending machine that is not directly attached to a Sprinkles bakery.
“We thought we were pretty cool when we introduced the Burrito Box concept a few years ago — that was another first,” said Kris Klinger, assistant vice president of retail operations at USC Hospitality. “The Sprinkles Cupcake ATM will elevate our vending program to a whole new level. Based on initial feedback from the community, we expect it to be well received by those who want a sweet treat.”

Photo courtesy of Def Jam RecordingsFirst day of school · While many artists succumb to sophomore slumps, Kanye West avoided this on his album Late Registration in 2004.
The sophomore slump may have started as an old wives’ tale, something to encourage students to work hard in school, but for musicians, it is a looming nightmare that has forced many of them into a cold sweat. A well-received first album doesn’t mean a damn thing in the world of music, and while the old saying “you’re only as good as your last success” may ring true, nobody wants to be a one-trick pony that will be forgotten like a relic of the past.
The sophomore album is essentially a make-it-or-break-it album for many artists. It acts as proof that they didn’t have beginner’s luck and their first album wasn’t just a fluke. Most artists don’t let the nerves of the sophomore slump affect them too much, as they are able to improve on what they did right on the first album. One such artist was able to do exactly that and more  with his sophomore album, and that artist is Kanye West.
Originally an up-and-coming producer from Chicago for great artists like Jay-Z,  Kanye West first appeared on the radar with his breakout album The College Dropout, which earned him two Grammys and some chart success. However, his sophomore album Late Registration, while polarizing to some, is one of the most influential albums in not only the music legend’s career, but also the genre of rap during the early 21st century.
This album, following the themes of The College Dropout included commentary on complex topics that rappers at the time did not dare speak about and stellar production that no one had heard before. Kanye began to express his true personality, one of the signature qualities that would earn him a notorious reputation for being brash, arrogant and bizarre, but also socially conscious and relatable. What separates this album from West’s first is how he expanded upon these themes and took them to a level that would transform him from a humble producer turned rapper with an album that true hip-hop fans adored, to an international music superstar.
One of the most impressive aspects of Kanye’s albums is his mastery of production, something that made his sophomore album stand out. West once again broke the mold of what was popular and dared to try something new, something different. The most interesting thing about this album is that he had to stand out from the competition, which was a direct result of him. With The College Dropout’s heavily R&B-influenced sound mixed with Kanye’s rapping, many producers  started to find chart-topping success by using a similar sound, so for his next trick, Kanye went grander and stranger with his production.
The bass and drums hit harder, the horns blare louder and the samples are even more unique. Instead of R&B, Kanye’s sound was heavily inspired by old soul joints that an older crowd could enjoy with nostalgic feelings while simultaneously educating a younger generation on what black music sounded like back in the day, and what its place was in a more contemporary setting.
The production on this album took rap to a place it wasn’t used to: a level of grandeur. With a track like “Diamonds Are Forever,” which samples the Nancy Sinatra song that was made for the James Bond movie of the same name, it’s no wonder that this album carries a sense of class. In addition, Kanye makes use of a live orchestra on some tracks, such as my personal favorite, “Late,” and the song “Celebration,” which allegedly was difficult to record since Kanye’s rhymes made orchestra members laugh while they were recording. The regality of a live orchestra, the use of drum and bass kits that had never been heard before and the ability to take something old and make it new again shattered the expectation of what exemplary production should sound like on a rap album.
At the same time, Kanye’s rhymes were more concise, thought out and witty, which made him sound more mature and experienced than he was in his previous album. Once again, Kanye went to places many rappers were afraid of venturing into. In “Heard ‘Em Say,” Kanye paints a bleak picture of what it’s like to be black in America, and in “Addiction,” he has an honest dialogue about his addictions and how they negatively affect his life.
One of his most impressive tracks on the album, “Hey Mama,” is simply a song that expresses the love and respect he has for his mom. In the song, he details moments from his life where his mom was his hero, such as encouragement to get back on a bike after falling off and not letting romantic partners get in the way of the bond they shared as mother and son. There weren’t many rap songs at the time that were filled with such childlike happiness saying how great their mom was, and there still aren’t, but Kanye wasn’t afraid to put this side of him on the album for anyone to listen to and judge.
Kanye’s personality very much shines on this album, and the public got its first taste of the full Kanye West package. One moment, he’s pointing out how racial discrimination is still an aspect of the high rates of unemployment in the black community. In another he’s humorously and not so subtly implying that a woman is a gold digger. Then, on a different song, he’s bragging about his talents that make him a cut above the rest. Self-assured, witty and sometimes just plain weird, Kanye wore his heart on the record sleeve, and everyone loved it. You would be hard-pressed to find another artist that had put so much of their personality on an album and found international success.
Kanye West went from radio plays in America from his first album to having the people of France hollering “We want pre-nup” in the clubs of Paris with his second. There’s a line in “Touch the Sky” where Kanye mentions that Jay-Z once said to him “‘Damn, dawg! You where I am!’” By this, Kanye means that with just two albums, he was able to achieve the success of what Jay-Z, a mentor to Kanye, did with eight albums. Regardless of what you think of him now, Late Registration is proof that Kanye West is a brilliant artist whose individuality helped advance and transform the landscape of rap albums after him, and it earns a special place in my heart as my favorite Kanye West album.

Photo courtesy of Def Jam Recordings Four years, no call · Frank Ocean released his sophomore album Blonde on Saturday, after years of anticipation from fans. It came available after Ocean’s visual album Endless was made available on Apple Music.
The seemingly endless postponing of singer Frank Ocean’s album finally came to an end with the release of Blonde Saturday. Four years after his critically acclaimed debut, Channel Orange, Blonde arrived to his fans with anticipation, frustration and elation due to the huge time gap in between his works.
An original member of hip-hop collective Odd Future, and songwriter for Beyoncé, John Legend and many others, Ocean showcases his talents in an experimental project that can be considered neo-soul that is heavily influenced by hip-hop as well as rock and electronic production.  Avoiding social media, the artist known for his hit song, “Thinkin Bout You,” did not release any details regarding his album release. He is credited as the executive producer, with his name throughout the credits of the album.  This recording period might be a testament to Ocean’s perfectionism to what he considers a concept album in Blonde, which is clearly not a follow-up to Channel Orange, but a progression in his own experiments.
“Nikes,” the first track which was released with a music video on Apple Music, features a pitched-up voice for the first two-thirds of the song, referencing to recent historical events and pop culture phenomena. His half-rap, half-sung composition permeates throughout the album in different pitches and tones, yet there are many unfiltered points where he lets his range shine effortlessly. One of those moments is in the chorus of “Solo,” where he paints a picture of his life between heaven and hell as he finds himself split from a lover. The following track, “Skyline To,” builds upon that with a mellow, echoey guitar with reverberations and background noise that mimics an outdoor set recording. As the album unfolds, there is a painstaking attention to detail in creating a soundscape that Ocean monitors through every frequency, supported by Assistant Producer Malay, who also served as a producer in Channel Orange.
In the complex arrangement of “Nights,” Ocean is able to weave guitars and sub-synths seamlessly on with a natural tone and then transform the entire mood with a humming harmonization of his voice and electronic tones in a way which only his music does. On the less hectic tracks like “White Ferrari” and “Seigfried,” the production does an exceptional job of making otherwise mundane synth progressions pop out with lively mastering that complements his voice. It takes a more analog-sounding approach in an age where computer-generated and digitally-created instruments often rule. Similar to the aesthetics that Ocean has used for previous album artworks, he avoids the high-tech for quality and liveliness, and gives a nod to artists who have produced in the same fashion by sampling Stevie Wonder and interpolating The Beatles into the album. The transition between “Seigfried” and “Godspeed” exemplifies many of these qualities. Both tracks may have been the ones most difficult to create technically, and are combined with Ocean’s powerful lyrics. “Godspeed” features a prayerful love song, but both songs blossom into instrumental outros that sharply contrast the style in which they begin.
Ocean crosses conventional rule of thumb not only by overpowering effects or hard slices and chops as one may hear on an album like The Life of Pablo, but also be maintaining a method to his madness that makes it a superb concept piece. Blonde is a work meant to be listened to as a whole, along with audiophile speakers or headphones to appreciate the nuances and transitions in each song. Frank Ocean has never been one to be creatively restrained, as Nostalgia, Ultra and Channel Orange spread across a spectrum of styles and influences with spoken word bits in between.
Blonde pushes the envelope even further, as the album is the fulfillment of what one may expect a blueprint of a true to heart Frank Ocean album would be: progressive, unorthodox, sonically detailed, a bit disorganized, but  perfectly polished. Rather than submit to public or corporate demand, Ocean’s strive for perfection is not meant to emulate his influencers or a particular style, but to bring his own concept album to life with precise details to the musical equivalent of an atom. Whereas some may view it as taking a creative risk or a necessary journey in an artist’s catalogue, Blonde is Ocean’s expression at its finest form. Frank Ocean has found and constructed his own tangible musical fingerprint from pure concept, and it is probable that he would have it no other way: perfectly unique.

A study released by researchers at Keck School of Medicine of USC this August indicated that cancer cases in Los Angeles County lie along ethnic and gender lines. Dennis Deapen, a professor of clinical preventative medicine at USC, authored the study which tracked more than 1.3 million cancer diagnoses over the course of 37 years. The book Cancer in Los Angeles County: Trends by Race/Ethnicity 1976-2012 details cancer trends along racial and generational lines.
Lihua Li, an assistant professor of preventative medicine at Keck, who co-authored the study described stark differences between socioeconomic classes. Li described each type of cancer as having its own particular demographic breakdown.
“Our study is a report card for cancer trends along racial and generational lines. We found striking disparities between races, ethnicities and social classes,” Li said. “Cancer comes in many different forms and types, and each cancer has a unique racial, ethnic profile. For example, breast cancer is actually more common among upper-class white women.”
The study found that breast cancer was the most common diagnosis among women in Los Angeles County, followed by colorectal cancer. According to the report, breast cancer on the whole appears to be on the decline, except for in Korean women.
Reported trends also showed that black men were the most likely to diagnosed with cancer, especially prostate cancer, and black people across gender lines were at a higher risk of developing cancer of the pancreas, kidney and esophagus. For men, the most prevalent diagnoses were prostate and lung cancer, respectively. The only exception being Vietnamese men, who have the highest incidence of lung cancer in their population.
The researchers used data from USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is considered one of 45 nationwide comprehensive cancer centers. When a person in Los Angeles County is diagnosed with cancer, they unknowingly contribute to the state-mandated Norris database.
Los Angeles County has provided a diverse group of samples for the report. Immigrant populations living in the county have allowed the researchers to study the effects of the Western lifestyle on cancer type and frequency. In a statement, USC described that the risks of certain cancers which are prevalent in immigrants’ home countries — such as stomach and liver cancer — decrease when immigrants live in the U.S. In fact, stomach cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, has been on a steady decline for the at-risk Korean and Japanese populations. Yet, certain cancer risks may increase upon migration to the U.S., including breast cancer.
“Asian women living in Los Angeles experience higher and continuously rising breast cancer risk compared to their counterparts living in Asia. That’s because breast cancer is more prevalent in developed countries with Westernized lifestyles,” USC said in the statement.
A significant conclusion of the study was that cancer is based more on environmental choices than commonly believed. Li attributes a large proportion of cancer risks to tobacco use, drug use, poor diet and a lack of exercise.
“Cancer risks change so quickly that it’s difficult to keep track. But we do know that while genetic factors account for a small percentage of cancer risk, the larger issues are behavioral,” Li said. “Most of the cancer cases are non-genetically based conditions.”
Li advises that people focus on their personal health, rather than looking at hereditary causes of cancer.
“We hope that these findings will remind people that health is behavioral. If you want to beat cancer, it’s better to start with yourself,” Li said.

Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presidential candidate, is ahead of Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton for the first time since the beginning of August, according to the Los Angeles Times/USC Dornsife Presidential Election Daybreak poll results released on Monday.
The poll, which has been ongoing since July 10, shows that as of Monday, Trump has the support of 44.6 percent of those polled, while Clinton has the support of 43.5 percent.
Support for Trump had declined from 44.6 percent on the Aug. 4 to 42 percent on the 14th, after which it started slowly climbing to surpass Clinton on the 20th.
Last week, Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort resigned. Since then, his successor, Kellyanne Conway, has stated that Trump is reconsidering his stance on illegal immigrants, which has been the backbone of his campaign since he started his presidential campaign.
Among millennials, Clinton leads by a 0.5 percent margin, while Trump leads among those aged 35-64 and those 65 years of age and up.
Additionally, support for Trump is higher among those without a college degree in comparison to those who attended and graduated from college.
The poll “is a probability survey that will provide a best estimate of how America plans to vote in the November election,” according to Dornsife News. It is part of the “Understanding America Study” currently carried out by the Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Los Angeles Times.
Participants in the poll are randomly selected. They represent the United States’ diverse demographics.
Every day, participants in the poll answer the same three questions. They are asked to rate, on a scale of 0-100, the chance that the participant will vote in the presidential election. They must then respond with the chance the participant will vote for Clinton, Trump or another candidate, as well as whether they believe that Clinton, Trump or another candidate will win.
