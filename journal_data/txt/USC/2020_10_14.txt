Undergraduate students will be able to choose a pass/no pass grading option for the current fall semester, President Carol Folt announced in a video shared on her personal Instagram page and in a Universitywide email Wednesday. This decision follows a student-led petition that amassed over 5,500 signatures and push from Undergraduate Student Government leadership. 
Students can opt in to pass/no pass grading between Nov. 2 and Nov. 13, the final day of classes, according to the USC COVID-19 Resource Center website. Provost Charles Zukoski said in an email that students will also be able to drop any course up until the same deadline. 
According to the USC COVID-19 Resource Center website, courses taken pass/no pass can count toward all major, minor and graduation requirements for undergraduate students this semester. However, pass/no pass courses will still be capped at 24 units to be counted toward graduation.
Normally, students must take major and minor courses as well as the University writing requirement for a letter grade. Students also usually can’t opt to take more than one general education course as pass/no pass for it to count toward graduation requirements. 
When classes abruptly transitioned online in Spring 2020, the University gave students the option to change any courses to pass/no pass up until the end of the grading period. This semester, students must decide whether to take a course pass/no pass or for a letter grade by the last day of classes and before the final exam period. 
Folt also announced that the upcoming spring semester will begin Jan. 15 and run a full 15 weeks unlike the shortened 12 week fall semester. The University is awaiting clearance from Los Angeles Department of Public Health to resume in-person activities, Folt said in the video. 
“Even though USC is a private institution, we, like all universities in Los Angeles, are bound by the decisions and the restriction of the L.A. County health officials,” Folt said. “At this point, we still do not have clearance from the county to resume on-campus activities beyond those already approved.”
Even if more in-person activities become available in the spring semester, Folt said students could complete their courses entirely online. 
According to Zukoski, some courses for the spring semester will be offered in hybrid and in-person settings, with the majority remaining online. The email also stated that there will be no spring recess to “minimize the risk of the virus spreading due to travel.” The break will be replaced by a “personal wellness day program.” 
Undergraduate students who have enrolled as full-time students at USC for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters can also apply for the Academic Progress Scholarship to cover a maximum of eight units of coursework in Summer 2021, Zukowski’s email read. This scholarship is geared toward students whose academic progress has been slowed due to the coronavirus, but students will be expected to pay various University fees. 
Although current county guidelines restrict in-person activity, Folt said that she is hopeful the University can work with county leaders to “get permission to return to a more active campus life for the Spring semester.”
“When we do get the green light from the county, I want you to know though, we are prepared and ready,” Folt said. “Our classrooms are completely reconfigured, our facilities are on an extensive, regular cleaning schedule, our COVID testing stations are set up on both campuses. We are so ready.”

“I think masks are OK … I put a mask on when I think I need it … I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from them, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.”
Above is what President Donald Trump said at the first presidential debate Sept. 29 between him and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Trump seemed to find it outrageous — even comedic — that Biden was taking proper health measures during a pandemic.
Later that same week, Trump came out with this tweet: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”
It’s difficult to determine exactly who he’s referring to when he says “together,” because it certainly does not include those who have been dutifully wearing masks and doing their best to stay inside to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. It doesn’t include those who have been dying of the virus despite taking precautions because others are too ignorant or naive to do so themselves. It doesn’t include the people who are suffering through the disease and unable to afford health insurance or care at the sky-high rates they’re offered in the United States.
Rather, Trump’s “together” can only refer to those who, like himself, have not been abiding by safety guidelines. These people could be well on their way toward a positive diagnosis themselves. It’s fine for Trump, who has seemingly recovered from the virus. But Trump’s diagnosis will bear implications beyond his contraction of the virus; his reckless mindset toward the pandemic is infectious, much like the virus itself, and the cure for it may be even more elusive than the vaccine.
At face value, Trump contracting the virus seems like a warning — if you don’t wear a mask, you are increasing your chances of becoming infected with the virus, which could result in death. But coupled with his constant and monthslong downplaying of the virus’ severity and his nonchalant behavior even after his own diagnosis, Trump has spun the events of the past week to send the opposite message it should — you shouldn’t wear a mask because even if you do become infected, “I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”
The situation parallels the hypothetical, “if all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you jump too?” which considers the power of social influence on individual behavior. But in this case, there’s an added element of authority; the friend jumping off first is the president of the United States, and he’s telling you that there’s a big, fluffy mattress waiting for you at the bottom.
This is not the case for most Americans. Trump is back on his feet after having had access to some of the best medical resources this country can provide, but most others are not as fortunate. For him to tweet, “Don’t be afraid of COVID. Don’t let it dominate your life” when more than 200,000 people have died from it in the United States alone is absolutely ignorant and minimizes the dangers of the virus. Certainly, the family members and friends left behind by the hundreds of thousands of coronavirus deaths do not have the luxury of being able to be unafraid of it.
Trump is also telling Americans not to worry because a vaccine is on its way shortly. He has said that the vaccine would be made available to the public in October, conveniently before the presidential election. However, scientists and vaccine makers have repeatedly rebutted his claim, saying that a more realistic timeline would have the vaccine out by mid-2021. This suggests that Trump’s priority is not to protect the American people from the virus but, instead, to diminish the fear of it just enough to pull him through to a victory on Nov. 3. 
His opponent in this election has emphasized the importance of wearing masks. 
“Masks matter,” Biden said at a town hall event on Monday, Oct. 5. “These masks, they matter. It matters. It saves lives. It prevents the spread of the disease … There’s a lot to be concerned about.”
Biden went on to stress that wearing a mask is not just about protecting yourself but about protecting others as well.
“All the tough guys say: ‘I’m not wearing a mask. I’m not afraid,’” Biden said. “Well, be afraid for your husband, your wife, your son, your daughter, your neighbor or your co-worker. That’s who you’re protecting having this mask on. And it should be viewed as a patriotic duty to protect those around you.”
Biden, by the way, has not contracted the virus.
In the face of the election, it will be up to Americans to prevent Trump from continuing to set a fatal example for the public. A big, fluffy mattress does not lie at the bottom of the cliff. Please, wear a mask and save lives. Please, vote.

Although their representation at USC isn’t huge, Latinx professors and community members have made their mark at the University. George Sanchez, a professor of history and American studies and ethnicity, has mentored low-income and first-generation students and students of color. The USC Latino Forum has hosted various celebrations and events on Latinx topics, including an event that honored the work of the late Mexican American journalist Rubén Salazar. 
Latinx professors and students have time and again contributed to the USC community. They have held events such as Voices for Justice: 200 years of Latino Newspapers in 2009, a panel celebrating Spanish-speaking media, and have spearheaded efforts to raise awareness on Latinx issues and represent the voices of the small Latinx population on campus. However, despite their contributions to USC, these Latinx professors and students make up only a small percentage of the campus’ population. In the early 2000s, Latinx professors were sparse and scattered across USC’s 23 schools, as were students. Twenty years later, these numbers have stayed largely the same — the student body currently consists of 15% Hispanic students, and only 6% of USC professors identify as Latinx, according to USC’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. 
The proportion of tenured Latinx professors has also remained roughly the same over time. Currently 5% of the faculty is Latinx, less than a three percentage point increase since 2001. Just 5% of tenure track faculty members identified as Latinx during the 2019-20 academic year compared to 4% in 2001. 
Of the 15 schools from which the Daily Trojan requested faculty and staff diversity reports, only the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the School of Dramatic Arts and the Kaufman School of Dance responded. A University spokesperson said some schools did not have diversity statistics readily available. 
At Annenberg, there were three Latinx tenured professors in 2017 and five in 2018, according to the school’s Diversity Initiative 5-year-Strategic Plan. Kaufman has two Latinx faculty members, neither of whom are on tenure and one who is an artist-in-residence, a post that allows artists within an institution to research or produce work and provide educational instruction to students for a limited period of time. SDA currently has four Latinx tenured faculty members, according to the school’s data. 
Nearly two-thirds of USC’s tenured Latinx faculty in 2019 were men, only a slight decrease from 2001, when just under 75% of the Latinx faculty were men. The data did not indicate whether faculty at USC identified as transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming or gender fluid or if they were given the option to signify their gender identity. 
Students at schools across USC have called on administrators to diversify their staff, particularly to increase the representation of Black and Indigenous people and people of color. Letters and Instagram posts directed to individual schools such as SDA and the School of Architecture were created in light of ongoing Black Lives Matter protests and calls for universities to address racism at their institutions.

Since arriving at USC, sophomore Micaela Mengen has tried to drink mate as often as she can. It’s a close tie to life at home with her Uruguayan family in New Jersey. She hasn’t tried to make her grandmother’s tortas fritas yet but plans to when she finds the right ingredients in Los Angeles.
“It’s definitely very hard to preserve my Uruguayan culture,” Mengen said, before acknowledging that in New Jersey she was never around many Uruguayans anyway. “It’s very hard to get access to my food. I only found one Argentinian, Uruguayan cafe that sells some products, but it’s all the way in Culver City.”
As with Mengen, life at USC has proven to be a cultural change for many Latinx students who come to University Park Campus for college. Mengen’s former world of Cuban, Colombian and Chilean cuisines was replaced with the predominantly Mexican and Salvadoran cuisines of her new city. 
Students from a variety of Latinx cultural backgrounds, traditions, experiences and identities have had to navigate new realities at USC, home to a student body that is 15% Hispanic. Many have been thrown into a world opposite to what they’ve known, where they now work to preserve the traditions they’ve grown up with, all while finding community.
“You have that bond of knowing each other’s culture,” said Mengen, who is majoring in international relations global business and data science. “You can understand all the inside jokes, you can eat the same food. All these things.”
Lo bonito de ser Latinx
At home, senior Michael Uranga’s closest ties to his Mexican roots have been intimately linked with family and faith. 
Growing up in Yorba Linda, a city with a similar proportion of Latinx individuals to USC, Uranga said connecting with his culture always meant meeting up with his cousins at his grandmother’s house in Whittier, hearing the Spanish of his aunt’s conversations echo across the house. Big birthday parties at his aunt’s home nearby always meant mariachi music and good food.
Because of school — and now the coronavirus pandemic — the accounting major hasn’t been able to be with his family in the same way as before, though he’s been able to grow more closely connected to his Latinidad and Catholicism through the Caruso Catholic Center. 
Now the president of the Catholic Center’s executive board, Uranga said that looking back, he’s thankful for all the friendships he’s been afforded there.
“I was able to meet really interesting friends of Latino heritage that have had much different experiences than me,” Uranga said. “Some grew up in Nicaragua their whole lives, others from Mexico and had moved to Canada for some time. Seeing what their experiences were like kind of helped feed me in knowing that, yeah, we have all different backgrounds of what it means to be Latino, but we can come together in the church.”
For others, the most prominent way they’ve tried to stay in touch with their roots is through food and tradition. 
Daniela Flores, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, always makes time for la hora de la once — tea time — as she was accustomed to in Chile. 
“When I first moved here, I [was] like, ‘Why is nobody drinking tea at 6 p.m.? What’s going on?’” Flores said, laughing. “So that’s something that I’ve implemented at my house. If I have guests over, they know that at 6 p.m. we have tea and that’s just how it goes.”
Alexandra Da Silva, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, is used to maintaining her Venezuelan identity primarily through family, having grown up in Redondo Beach, which is one-sixth Latino. Christmas means hallacas, and when New Year’s Eve comes around, it’s time for yellow underwear for good luck, 12 grapes for 12 wishes and a quick walk around the block with a suitcase for wealth and travels, among other traditions.
“It’s definitely been a lot easier to keep up with traditions and stuff since I’ve been home,” said Da Silva, who is taking classes remotely from Redondo Beach. “We predominantly eat Venezuelan food when I’m home, whereas when I’m in college, obviously, I’m not gonna take time to make Venezuelan food.”
Freshman Gabriela Martinez, who is in New Jersey, is also closely tied to her Salvadoran and Nicaraguan roots through her family. 
Growing up in Newark, a city dominated by Puerto Rican and Dominican culture, Martinez said her parents taught her to carry her pride for the two small Central American countries they called home nearly four decades ago. It’s a sense of pride she feels each time she takes a bite of a pupusa or a nacatamal or whenever she attends family parties for get-togethers.
“Those aspects of the culture definitely have blended Salvadoran-Nicaraguan dialect with Puerto Rican and Dominican dialect, which has also been really funny, but also really interesting,” said Martinez, who is majoring in political science.
Similar to Mengen, Martinez expects to face a strong change in environment when she eventually attends classes in person. However, she has family near campus that she’s excited to connect with on a deeper level.
Outside of family, language has been a considerably deep tie to identity for those who are accustomed to speaking Spanish at home and in their communities. 
For junior Maria Takigawa, a Peruvian American who primarily grew up in the border city of El Paso, Texas, she’s always made the extra effort to practice Spanish at home. She’s also been used to ordering at restaurants and taco trucks in Spanish, something she hasn’t necessarily been able to do on campus.
“I think it’s interesting because El Paso is very much rooted in Mexican culture — the bordertown to Juarez,” Takigawa said. “So I didn’t really grow up seeing my own culture, Peruvian culture, reflected here, but I grew up seeing Mexican culture, which I also really enjoy.”
Familia entre desconocidos
Even for junior Danny Proa, who grew up near East L.A., just a few miles from the University Park Campus, entering USC required much adjustment. 
Suddenly, small things such as mannerisms and speech were completely different, which resulted in second-guessing pronunciations and the diction he was accustomed to in his 96% Latinx part of town.
“Here I am still with this accent in a way, and it makes me doubt my abilities even though I have to remind myself that I got into USC for a reason and that I belong there,” said Proa, who is majoring in cinema and media studies.
This experience has been no different for senior Victor Peralta, who has felt the sudden yet significant change in atmosphere between his home in South Gate and campus.
“Right when you get within a block of campus, it feels almost like you have to walk a little straighter and put your college face on because you have to realize there’s a bunch of people just trying to make it out here, people that are gonna judge you, how you carry yourself and the way you present yourself, the way you talk,” said Peralta, who is majoring in narrative studies. “There’s a big difference than when I’m back home.” 
For some students, finding cultural connections at USC has been easiest through friends, cultural organizations and their programming. 
La CASA is the most predominantly Latino-centered space on campus, situated among other cultural centers tucked on the fourth floor of the Student Union. The tiny, cozy space invites students with its bright, colorful walls and a vibrant mural emblazoned with messages of empowerment. In the typical, in-person semester, students would walk in and out of the space frequently. It’s constantly occupied by students working, chatting or stopping by the kitchen.
“Sometimes when you attend a predominately white institution, it’s often hard to see others that look like you, perhaps now on a screen, but on campus,” said Naddia Palacios, the interim director of La CASA.
Palacios replaced former director Billy Vela after he was removed from his position Oct. 7. 
 “We want to make sure, you know, you at least have that space that could be like, ‘OK, this is my primary identity. I can go in there and find support,’” she said. 
Peralta is one student who found community through the cultural center, though he didn’t find it until later in his USC journey. It wasn’t until his junior year, after meeting some friends who are now his roommates at the involvement fair, that he ventured into La CASA. 
“I would always disregard that email because I felt like I didn’t see them anywhere else other than my email,” Peralta said. “I guess I didn’t really, for lack of a better word, believe them … but when I actually went to the middle of the office in the student center, it was so welcoming, it was crazy.” 
“I went in there and it smelled like my house back home, like you smell a kitchen, like mom’s cooking,” he added, “It was just people like me studying, eating their lunch.”
La CASA also supports a special interest community in Fluor Tower known as El Sol y La Luna, a floor dedicated to connecting students of Latinx backgrounds with one another. Although Martinez hasn’t been able to live on the floor physically, she’s been able to connect with students virtually.
Aside from La CASA, the Latinx Student Assembly oversees more than 20 different Latino-focused organizations. As a leading group on campus, LSA focuses largely on creating a safe, welcoming space for students of all backgrounds through intentional programming that tackles common issues and major topics of discussion, including colorism, machismo and homophobia.
“There’s still issues very prevalent in our community,” said Miguel Moran, LSA’s director of external affairs. “So just programming in collaboration with other LSA member orgs … is something that LSA has done really well.”
Donde las identidades se cruzan
Latinidad is not just about regional heritage but also about intersectionality.
Though Proa has gone to La CASA a few times, he found his true home at the Lavender Lounge through the LGBTQ+ Student Center. 
For Proa, being Latinx and LGBTQ+ means walking an intersection less traveled. The Latino community isn’t known for embracing LGBTQ+ individuals, which makes it difficult to find others who have chosen to outwardly embrace their identities, he said.
“I met this amazing guy,” Proa said. “He was a worker there, and he was transgender. So he took the time to chat with me about his experiences, and it was then that I was like, ‘holy shit, it makes sense.’ I felt a little bit in tune with myself.”
After being exposed to what it meant to be transgender from those at the Lavender Lounge, Proa began to seek out more information about it.
Coming from a family with values deeply rooted in Catholicism and heteronormativity, Proa said being accepted as transgender has not been an easy road. He said growing up in a largely Latinx community like East L.A. didn’t allow him to truly understand identity in its broad scope until reaching USC and connecting with people at the Lavender Lounge. 
“After going to the Lavender room, I got more confidence to be myself and actually came out to my peers around me,” Proa said. “I actually was exposed to learning about transgender people. And it’s kind of embarrassing that it took me to go to college to learn about individuals like that. I started questioning everything around me; I started questioning myself.”
Lauren Pierre, a junior majoring in psychology, also finds herself at an intersection. 
It’s been easier for her to connect with her Black culture, she said, because of her outward appearance, but she’s grown up largely around her mom’s Mexican family that resides mostly in Southern California. 
She lived on the Somerville Place Residential Floor in Fluor Tower through the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs her first year and has gone to LSA and La CASA meetings and programming, which has allowed her to grow from their resources.
“I have two friends that I lived with my freshman year on Somerville, on the all Black floor, but they’re also half Mexican,” Pierre said. “So it’s been pretty cool connecting with them because I didn’t really have any other friends in high school that were half Latinx and half Black.”
For Takigawa, whose Japanese background also serves as a large part of her identity, she’s felt more comfortable finding community among individuals rather than groups. Although she is part of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism outlet Dímelo, which covers the Latinx community on campus and beyond, she hasn’t truly felt as comfortable connecting with La CASA or the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly because her identity is in between.
“I think it’s interesting to be perceived as more Asian-looking,” Takigawa said. “But I know that I can speak Spanish better than Japanese, and certain parts of myself, I feel that I’m more Latina … I gravitate more to Spanish. And with food and countrywise I know Japan better than I know Peru.”
Takigawa finds that people often don’t realize that Peru received an influx of Japanese immigrants in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Both her parents are ethnically Japanese, though her mom is from Peru and her dad from Japan. Despite this, she’s always found the Latinx community welcoming whether on or off campus.
“It’s mi gente. If you meet a Latina, they’re gonna help you and you’re going to help them,” Takigawa said. “I think that’s the best part of the Latinx community. It’s so warm and loving.”
That’s a sentiment Peralta finds true too, especially since connecting with Latinos at USC.
“I feel like it means much more to me, and it’s a big part of who I am,” Peralta said about his Latinidad. “When I was a little bit younger, coming into college, my major was the thing I wanted people to know about me first, but right now, I guess having grown a little bit, having seen a bit more and having experienced the community here, I feel like I want people to know that I’m a Chicano. I’m a Mexican American.” 
“I want people to know that there’s more of us here,” he added. “We deserve to be here just like them.”

Tucked away on the fourth floor of the Gwynn Wilson Student Union lies La CASA, a space on campus dedicated solely to Latinx students. Before activities went online for the rest of the fall semester, La CASA provided a physical space dedicated to cultivating a family among all those who identify as Latinx. Its lime mural walls illustrate the decades of Latinx history and stories formed at USC. 
La CASA is situated in an institution that has remained predominantly white since its founding, a stark contrast to the surrounding South Central area, where about 80% of the population comprises Latinx individuals. As of Fall 2020, only 15% of USC’s student population identifies as Latinx. On campus, members of the Latinx community have worked to create a safe space for themselves and for future generations. 
The emergence of the Chicano movement during the larger civil rights movement in the 1960s empowered Latinx college students across the country to organize and amplify their voices, fighting for institutional expansion of representation, spaces and programs. At USC, a Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán chapter, which aimed to promote the success of the Latinx community through higher education, was established alongside hundreds of others at universities across the country. 
The move to create La CASA, then known as El Centro Chicano, was spearheaded by the Latinx activists on campus in 1972 to provide a place for personal, professional and cultural growth for Latinx students. A year later, USC created the Mexican American Alumni Association, after the executive director of USC’s Mexican American programs, Raúl Vargas, and eight Mexican American alumni saw a need to assist Latinx students with their development through higher education and the cost associated with it. Today it exists as the Latino Alumni Association to reflect how the association provides scholarship aid to students of all Latinx identities. And a year after that, the special interest community El Sol y La Luna Floor emerged in 1974 to build an atmosphere that would make the transition to college easier for incoming freshmen. 
Throughout the decades, the experience of Latinx students at USC has been varied. While the University has cultivated more spaces on campus for Latinx students since the 1970s, some say there is still a ways to go. Here are three accounts from both past and current Latinx students at USC. 
1980s: Professor Laura Castañeda
When Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Laura Castañeda attended USC in the mid-1980s, she felt unable to connect with the Latinx community around her. With most of her peers being white, Castañeda felt isolated from others, but more than anything, her biggest fear was failing to prove to herself and to her family that going to USC was not a mistake, she said. 
“There were so few of us and there wasn’t a lot for us,” said Castañeda, who graduated from USC in spring of 1985. “We didn’t really have anything like La CASA … Was it a safe space? I mean, I don’t know. I had a really hard time my freshman year, a really hard time.” 
Impostor syndrome was prominent among Latinx students on campus back in 1981, Castañeda said. She felt going to USC was a mistake and feared her home community would judge her. 
“It was kind of like that impostor syndrome that I was putting all this pressure on myself,” she said. “I had to succeed because otherwise people at home would think, ‘Oh gosh, there’s a smart girl [we] sent off to school and what, she can’t hack it?’” 
While at USC, Castañeda sought a community of other Latinx students. She found and became a member of MEChA de USC, a Chicanx/Latinx organization on campus that celebrated students of color. 
While at USC, Castañeda also found her home at the Daily Trojan. Along with being a reporter, Castañeda worked in multiple roles on the paper, including assistant features editor, editorial director and managing editor. Castañeda eventually ran for editor-in-chief but lost the election. Had she won, she would have been the first Latina editor-in-chief in the paper’s history. 
“There were not a lot of Latinos/Latinas, but the ones I knew were good friends of mine,” Castañeda said. “The [Daily Trojan] actually was very diverse so there were cool people there.”
After graduating from USC with her bachelor’s degree, Castañeda worked as a professional journalist for five years and studied business and economics reporting at Columbia Journalism School before once again returning to her alma mater in 2000 as an assistant journalism professor.
It was odd to teach alongside her former professors whom she had admired, she said. 
“I really had to wrap my head around that at first, but they were great, they were very welcoming and really, really kind to me,” Castañeda said. “They showed me the ropes so to speak. Also it was just a real honor, I mean it sounds kind of corny but what a real honor for me to come back to my alma mater and teach.” 
Castañeda eventually served as the associate director and assistant director of the School of Journalism from 2010-14 during which she oversaw curriculum revisions for both undergraduate and graduate students. As a professor, she got involved with La CASA to support the network she never had as a student. She backed the center’s move to change its name from El Centro Chicano to La CASA when conversations about moving away from the Chicano label surfaced in 2018, saying the organization needed to become inclusive of all Latinx identities. 
“It needed to change to be more welcoming to all Latinos,” Castañeda said. “Not just the [Latinos] that identify as Chicanos [and/or] Mexican American.”
1990s: Alumnus Jaime Rojas Jr. 
Attending USC in the early 1990s before the dot-com boom meant that the first time 1996 alumnus Jaime Rojas Jr. learned about El Sol y La Luna was through a tri-fold brochure he had received in the mail. He knew he wanted to live on campus and believed living on Fluor Tower’s Latinx floor would be the best way to connect with others of similar backgrounds on campus. There weren’t many other ways to do so, he said. 
“It helped [with the] transition going into school,” Rojas said. “It was a great experience by different people from all walks of life … from first-generation to second-, third-generation as well from different parts of the country, public school, private school, transfers.”
The floor also provided the resources for residents to join and create Latinx organizations. In turn, membership in these clubs resulted in students’ gaining confidence to branch out and join clubs that were not necessarily Latinx-oriented, Rojas said. 
“[Having] that safety net, as a group on the Latino floor, also helped some of the students participate in organizations that weren’t necessarily Latino-focused … different programs, different clubs and … a variety of different things, even just the Greek system.”
His senior year, Rojas worked as a resident assistant on the Latinx Floor and helped establish a more thorough application process. The RAs wanted to find the best students they could: Ones who would be involved leaders on the floor and at USC. These efforts created a cohesive group of residents, who Rojas said included a group of women who started the Latina sorority, Sigma Lambda Gamma.
However, while the Latinx Floor gave its residents a place of comfort and support, Rojas said the Latinx community still faced adversity on campus. 
“We dealt with some students coming up to the seventh floor, writing crap on our boards,” he said. “At one time, someone … actually lit on fire the information board.” 
The fear incited by these incidents was heightened by the civil unrest that was happening in the streets of Los Angeles during the 1992 Rodney King riots following the beating of King, a Black man, by officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. When the policemen were acquitted, even though the beating was caught on camera, the incident fueled five days of uprising during which people took their anger to the streets. 
“We got to see [the unrest] from the seventh floor,” Rojas said. “We got stuck at ‘SC watching as the city around us was just erupting in protests and violence and fires, watching the National Guard tanks going down Jefferson and Hoover.”   
Regardless of how much these events shook the community, Rojas said they were significant in bonding Latinx students of all backgrounds. The riots also forced dialogue about racial discrimination and Latinx representation on campus, pushing students to fight for a more just, inclusive environment. 
In the mid-1990s, discussions also rose about offering Chicano studies on university campuses. Rojas recalls hearing about students at UCLA tying themselves to buildings with the hopes of forcing the hands of the UC system to implement a Chicano studies program. 
While at USC, Rojas said there was a behind-the-scenes movement to bring Chicano studies to campus. In response to the uproar, USC decided to put together a team of key University leaders to improve the American studies department because they wanted to avoid the same level of protests as the UC campuses.  
Rojas was a part of the select group of students in the Price School of Public Policy who worked on the initiative to establish a Latinx and Chicano studies program. Since 1994, students have had the option to major in Chicano/Latino studies, which incorporates courses with an emphasis on the historical, political and cultural experiences of Chicanx and Latinx communities in California and the West Coast. 
On campus, the impact of the work of student activists like Rojas is clear. In Founder’s Park, a memorial honoring Cesar Chávez was dedicated in March 1997. The plaque was commissioned because of the push by students and staff who wanted to commemorate Chávez’s visits to USC and significance to Latinx history and pride. 
The dynamics of Latinx activism at USC have changed since Rojas was a student in the ’90s, but by no means is the struggle for representation over, he said.  
“Yes, it’s changing dynamics,” Rojas said. “And changes could take long, it’s going to be generational.”
2020: Junior Alexia Sambrano
George Floyd’s killing in late May sent a wake-up call across the world. Hundreds of students participated in demonstrations across the nation against police brutality and systemic racism. At college campuses, which have cultivated hubs for activism, some students — including those in the Latinx community — have initiated and engaged in discussions surrounding Black Lives Matter. Some students have shared posts about the toxicity of machismo and the anti-Black rhetoric often used within the Latinx community. However, according to Alexia Sambrano, a junior majoring in neuroscience and cognitive science, there is still much work to be done.  
Sambrano said they recognize the importance of intersectionality when fighting for not only Latinx representation but also the representation of all marginalized groups at USC.
On campus, Sambrano is the co-director of the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, an LGBTQ studies minor representative for the Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Council and the co-diversity, equity and inclusion chair for the USC Helenes, one of the University’s oldest service organizations. Additionally, Sambrano founded the USC Care Collective in March to provide helpful resources for USC students who come from marginalized communities.  
Sambrano spearheaded the chair position in Helenes to help members of the historically white organization unlearn and proactively relearn issues like gender inclusivity, implicit biases and systemic racism. 
Sambrano’s belief in taking action has also manifested in her work with USC Care Collective, which shares resources on Instagram and promotes a GoFundMe page to support USC students and student-led initiatives such as AffordableSC and Reimagining Public Safety USC. Their website provides updated information on Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ rights and the Free Palestine Movement, among others.  
“We wanted to make space for resources, whether it be emergency funding or mutual aid funds or links to donations sites or even just links to the other student orgs at USC to provide solidarity and support in community sense,” Sambrano said. 
Sambrano has also turned to their social media platform to speak out about social issues that are prominent at the University and across the world. On their Twitter and Instagram, Sambrano has consistently called USC out on issues that they deem problematic, including nomenclature behind what was previously the Von KleinSmid Center and reform for the Department of Public Safety.
“As much as I love being a student here and can’t imagine myself at any other university,” Sambrano said, “I’m still able to recognize why the work I’ve done and other students have done and the students before us have done is still super relevant now and important and should be compensated and paid attention to.”
Sambrano does not consider themself an activist, for their actions speak louder than the activist label. However, Sambrano said they are always thinking about how they can be a better ally through meaningful action and discussions. 
“I personally don’t really like to label myself things like ‘activists’ or ‘allies’ for communities that maybe I’m not a part of,” Sambrano said. “I’d rather show that I’m an ally or that I’m an activist by the actions that I’m doing [such as] donating, providing resources, sharing those resources with people … pushing people to engage in conversations that they otherwise wouldn’t really have in their normal community spaces.”

A wide-eyed transfer student, Cherise Cayetano attended her first Latinx Student Assembly meeting at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center back in her sophomore year. The meeting started off with an icebreaker question:  “Where are you from?” 
“Just hearing that [question] I was like, ‘Oh, that’s because I’m here,’” said Cayetano, now a senior majoring in law, history and culture. “And then I remember we were doing the exercise and this guy looked at me. He was like, ‘Yeah, where are you from?’ like ‘Why are you here right now?’ And I was like, ‘Sir, my family is from Central America, please.’”
Cayetano is Garífuna, but if someone were to ask her what she identifies as, she’d say Black or Afro-Latina to appease the masses. For Cayetano, checking off the race and ethnicity boxes has not been an easy decision but rather one rooted in confusion and doubt. There has never been a box that has perfectly encompassed what it means to be Garífuna — the Afro-Indigenous people, culture and language of Central America.
Racial identifiers used in these text boxes are ever-changing, and throughout decades, the search for a comprehensive, pan-ethnic term has evolved to meet global movements surrounding gender-inclusivity. While the terms Hispanic and Latino have been commonly used to describe those with Latin American or Spanish roots, resistance against these terms has resulted in the emergence of new identity markers, such as Latinx in the early 2000s, which has been adopted by USC organizations and in programming. 
As discussions surrounding terminology continue to grow, so does the continuous transformation of these terms. It was in these social circles that Miguel Moran, the Latinx Student Assembly director of external affairs, was recently introduced to the term “Latine” — what Moran called the non-anglicized version of “Latinx.” 
Latine evolved out of criticism of Latinx for its difficulty in pronunciation, according to a thesis by Kate Slemp of Western University. The “e” has appeared as a way to bypass gendered language and mimics Spanish’s already existing gender-neutral words such as estudiante and pariente. 
Although the term “Latine” is gaining traction among the USC community informally through student conversations, the LSA executive board has not discussed using the term in a more official capacity, Moran said. 
As more discussions are raised about the future of these terms, Natalia Molina, a professor of American studies and ethnicity at Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said that none of the terms used to describe Latinx individuals are perfect and all-encompassing. Nonetheless, they were constructed throughout time to meet a certain political moment. These terms originated as a way to be reflective of racial groups and to distinguish who was or wasn’t white, and as a result, deemed a U.S. citizen, she said. 
The term “Mexican” appeared on the U.S. Census for the first time during the 1930s, and after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 led individuals from different countries in Latin America to arrive in the United States, the labels were once again expanded to acknowledge larger pan-ethnic groups. Thus, the term Latino came into existence as a way to encompass a diverse group of people, such as Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Central Americans. 
However, the term Latino does not fully encompass the Latinx diaspora, spotlighting certain groups over others based on name recognition, Cayetano said. Cayetano applied to the LSA executive board to expand representation for Garífuna folk, and the assembly is continuing to strive toward more inclusivity, according to Moran. 
“People think that [Mexican] culture is the only Latinx culture here that exists, but not really. It’s not,” said Moran, a junior majoring in urban planning. “That’s the first step I would say that [LSA] takes in recognizing that Mexican hegemony, and not ignoring it or going against it, but kind of fighting it, fighting that stigma.”
In the past, the assembly has made active strides to redefine itself to be inclusive of all people. It changed its name to Latinx Student Assembly from Latino/a Student Assembly in Fall 2017. The change was passed by a unanimous vote in the Undergraduate Student Government Senate and marked LSA’s commitment to becoming more progressive, then-LSA co-Assistant Director Courtney Cox told the Daily Trojan in 2017. 
“I think in the previous years, LSA has been very passive about a lot of issues that affect our community,” Cox said in 2017. “I think we have really tried to step forward and advocate more for our community, whether it takes place in a protest or something else.”
Student organizations on campus such as the Central American Network have also pushed for more inclusive terms at USC. That’s how El Centro Chicano became the Latinx Chicanx for Advocacy and Student Affairs in Spring 2019. The name change was controversial, however, because of its ties to activism and empowerment that many did not want erased. 
Cayetano, then a member of CAN, remembers the pushback members experienced when advocating for the name change. She received texts from people questioning her advocacy on the change, claiming that she was trying to erase them from the center. Cayetano, nevertheless, remained determined. 
“Why do y’all get to have your name on a plaque, but we literally don’t? And this is supposed to be a space for everyone,” Cayetano said.
A majority of these discussions surrounding the name change occurred in town halls, where some Latinx students felt it was important to keep Chicano in the name to acknowledge the historical roots of the term, which rose to prominence during the Chicano movement of the 1960s. For Consuelo Sigüenza-Ortiz, a Dornsife associate professor of Spanish, the inclusion of the term “Chicano” meant recognizing the historical impact and the continued struggles of the Latinx community. 
As someone who grew up in that era, Sigüenza-Ortiz credited the Chicano movement as an opportunity for her to understand and connect with her bicultural identity. Sigüenza-Ortiz was raised in a Mexican household in Los Angeles where she struggled to navigate both Mexican and American cultures. 
“I felt kind of [like] an outsider because I wasn’t fully accepted for who I was, which was a daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico,” she said. “I had to forge the identity that I wanted to identify with, not that people try to impose on me.”
Sigüenza-Ortiz, whose sister was involved in the Chicano movement, embraced her newfound Chicana identity, turning it into a learning experience and a moment for self-empowerment that helped her navigate the anti-Chicanx sentiment of the 1960s. Though the term refers directly to Mexican Americans, Sigüenza-Ortiz said she believed its impact and importance should not be erased.
“We were kind of second-class citizens and not encouraged to speak Spanish,” Sigüenza-Ortiz said. “But then the Chicano movement happened, and suddenly, there was a pride, and the arts flourished. And so it was a great time to grow up in terms of social consciousness and establishing an identity.”
According to Molina, the politicization of identity labels, much like Chicano, has risen out of a need for large groups of people to have their dignity as human beings recognized. When it came to disparities in access to resources, such as education, political representation, unions and health care, identity labels allowed for people to come together and form social movements to advocate for their civil rights. 
“The idea of people being discriminated against or that they were shut out of certain resources because of their racial identity is something that people can relate to,” Molina said. “And that’s the reason that people can still come together under a broad term like Latino and say that wasn’t exactly my experience, but I see overlaps with my experience.”

Giuliana “Gugu” Olmos never planned to go to USC. In fact, she didn’t plan to go to college at all. Like many young tennis players, Olmos dreamt of playing professionally directly out of high school.
To Olmos and many others, going to college was seen as a step down since she wouldn’t be playing at the highest level immediately. However, now that she’s a professional and Women’s Tennis Association doubles title winner, Olmos can reflect on her past concerns about collegiate level tennis and dismiss them as misguided.
Now 27, Olmos is in the midst of a historic professional career. Though born in Austria and raised in California, Olmos represents her father’s birth country Mexico on an international level, which she’s done since she was just 16 years old. Olmos became the first Mexican player in the Open era to reach a WTA final at the Monterrey Open in 2018. A year later she became the first Mexican woman to win a WTA title, capturing the doubles championship at Nottingham in 2019.
Days before flying back to her home in California, Olmos talked to the Daily Trojan while visiting family in Austria.
Daily Trojan: So the recruiting process obviously started a little bit late for you, but when did you realize you might have to go to college? What made you fall in love with USC when you first came to visit?
Olmos: I started looking at colleges really late. Growing up, I thought if I went to college, [my career] was almost a failure. If I didn’t go pro right away, then I wasn’t going to make it. I think that was something really bad because going to college is not a failure.
I started looking at colleges [in] September of my senior year. I didn’t have that many options, but I also didn’t have bad options. I was talking to Cal, USC, North Carolina [and] Texas.
I liked the coaches [at USC], and it was also a really good school academically. That pulled me in. And the Trojan family, I heard all about it all the time. I thought it would be really cool to be a part of that. I actually had visits lined up to other schools after ’SC, but I didn’t visit any other school after that. 
DT: At 16, you were asked to make the decision of who you were going to represent internationally. When did you first start thinking about it? How many voices contributed to that decision? Was it an easy decision for you? 
GO: I never really thought about it. I was representing the U.S., and my dad is from Mexico. I was ranked [second] nationally at the time in the U.S. and Mexico didn’t have a lot of players and my dad knew a lot of people there. 
They had the World Junior Championships coming up, and every country sends in their top three players. They offered me [the choice that] if I switched from the U.S. to Mexico, I could play that tournament. They offered to pick up my traveling expenses. As a junior, that was really important because tennis is a really expensive sport. I started traveling a lot internationally so that got really expensive and it just seemed like a really good opportunity for me at the time. 
My dad was my coach at the time so he played a very big role, but I ended up switching. I was really happy I played World Junior Fed Cup, which was one of the coolest experiences of my life. I’ve been playing the professional Fed Cup ever since. I like playing for Mexico. It’s a lot of fun. 
DT: When it comes to the responsibilities of being a professional, I don’t think any program can fully prepare you for what that’s like. What’s something that took you time to adjust or something no one told you about when you became a professional that you were taken aback by?
GO: The first one is when you travel in college, you travel with your team, so you always travel with eight to 10 people a week. You travel with your teammates, so you have your friends there all the time. It’s always fun. I think that was hard because when you go on the Pro Tour, it’s very individual. You’re by yourself. It’s tough. 
The second thing is money. When you’re in college, the hotels are paid for, the flights are paid for. Everything is booked. You literally just show up, and all you have to do is play tennis, whereas on the road I had to learn. I didn’t realize how expensive things are, how much you have to plan in advance. 
You don’t know if you’re going to get into certain tournaments or not. When do you buy your flights? Who do you travel with? Who do you play doubles with? How do you get there? What if they don’t provide transportation to the tournament from the airport? You have to book all of that. There’s just so many things that you take for granted in college because you don’t have to do [them]. 
DT: There’s been things that have come to light with USC recently that are a little bit troubling in terms of racial insensitivity, lack of diversity in certain areas and other scandals. I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of them. I just want to get your thoughts on the current state of the perception and your affiliation with the University and tennis program. 
GO: I’m a very proud Trojan. I think even if not the best things happen, I am very proud and loyal to our school tennis-wise. I had the best four years of my life at ’SC and I would do it all over again if I could and I just want the girls who come after me to have that same experience or be able to say the same. As [for] our institution, I think we have a lot of room to grow. A lot of things have come to light this year and in the past few months. I think USC is very open, and I really respect how the Athletic Department is responding to everything. I think these are changes that we should have made years ago, but I think it’s good we’re finally starting to make them and having some of these difficult conversations. 
DT: You’ve mentioned the importance of the Trojan family and giving back to the tennis program specifically and how crucial that is to you. What word of advice do you have for readers or young women aspiring to play sports on a professional level? 
GO: I would say there’s only two things you need to do to make it, and they’re the hardest two things: Everyone needs to just believe in themselves and work, obviously, as hard as they can and just really commit and dedicate themselves to what they’re doing. But I think what’s more important than maybe reaching the goal is enjoying your journey [toward] the goal. We’re always looking forward to what’s next, the next tournament or the next match or where we’re going. I don’t think we often stop and take a look at how far we’ve come or appreciate the little things that we’ve had. Obviously [we’re] always trying to be better and reach our next goal but continuously stop and smell the roses and enjoy how far we’ve come.

Dancer, poet, activist y su tía de South Central, Jose Richard Aviles, 29, holds many roles, but working toward bettering their community and using their art to serve as an act of healing and justice for their people has been, and will always be, their priority.
Growing up in South Central, Aviles took to social justice work at a considerably young age. Whether it was working alongside the Labor Community Strategy Center’s Bus Riders Union or joining efforts for marriage equality, 15-year-old Aviles was out in the streets, doing their part — even if that meant receiving possible backlash from their parents. 
“I come from parents who come with this nightmare and bullshit that I call the American Dream … so they wanted me to be financially secure,” Aviles said. “How many times have you heard the comment ‘¿Para qué vine a este país? ¿Para que estuvieras en las calles allí protestando? Why did I come to this country so you’d be out there protesting?’ And I’d be like, ‘Mom! But they’re taking our rights away!’ That’s just who I’ve always been.”
Now, they are also using their passion for the arts to further engage with their community. Aviles is never as joyous as they are when they are dancing, and through community dance collectives and their own weekly dedicated time to moving their body, they strive to promote cultural education, respect and healing.  
South Central is the birthplace of their love for dance and movement, they said. 
“I’m born and raised in South Central and like yo, I learned how to dance before I learned how to walk,” Aviles said. “I was [always] at a quinceñera, at a bautizo, at a birthday party dancing with my cousins and dancing with my tías. It’s the thing that just gives me the most joy.”
Because they didn’t have considerable access to arts institutions and resources growing up, Aviles said they made sure to take advantage of what was made available to them during their undergraduate and graduate experiences in Minnesota and at USC, respectively. After starting college with the intent of studying social work, Aviles ultimately decided to major in dance and focus on enjoying their time before attending graduate school, they said.
However, after getting their undergraduate degree from St. Olaf College in Minnesota, Aviles took their time figuring out what they really wanted. After taking three years off — splitting time between their post-college fantasy trope of New York City, farm-ridden Wisconsin and their forever home in South Central — Aviles finally felt that graduate school was the next step in their journey. 
At USC, they pursued a dual masters program in social work and urban planning over three years and graduated in Spring 2019. Aviles was also able to find a space where dancing could be a prominent part of their graduate school experience through the Break On 2 salsa team, for which they served as captain and teaching artist for two years. 
Now, as both an alum and someone native to the local community in South Central, Aviles said they feel as though they have a special role to hold the University responsible for its engagement with the surrounding neighborhoods. 
“I am committed to this community, not to the University,” Aviles said. “I’ve always been committed to people and not institutions, but I also understand that this institution is a big stakeholder because it has capital power … My job as someone who is an alum and is a community member is to call them out and hold them accountable and to leverage resources for [the] community.”
Dancing keeps Aviles grounded. The salsa team allowed them to pinpoint time each week to move their body and feel joy, and Aviles knew they always needed to create space in their life for dance.
“I don’t know how to explain it, it’s what gives me life,” Aviles said. “I remember coming back from that social dancing and being like … ‘What was I feeling before this?’ … Being in this constant state of euphoria and not having experienced that before, I was like, ‘You know what? I never want to go back to not feeling this feeling, so let me create opportunities for myself to always dance and always feel.’”
Every Monday, followers of Aviles’s Instagram @soynalgona are graced with a new video tagged with the hashtag #MondayDeMovimiento — their way of making sure that feeling of euphoria is never lost. Especially now with safer-at-home orders in place, Aviles has made sure to keep their body moving and joyous. 
“During this time, it was really helpful because it was my way of reminding myself that my spirit was still good,” Aviles said. “I tell my friends the moment you ask me to go dancing and I say no, check in on me, something’s wrong.”
In addition to their Instagram dances, Aviles is also a member of the Dancing Diaspora Collective, an L.A.-based dance organization dedicated to honoring and sharing dance practices of the Latin and African diasporas. Patricia Huerta, a fellow Collective member, recently co-choreographed a piece with Aviles that was performed and prerecorded for a coming show at the Ford Amphitheatre — a dream come true for any South Central kid, according to Aviles. 
“We do a lot of collaborations, we are still performing together,” Huerta said. “[They] just bring a lot of knowledge to the table, to the group, and [their] expertise in creating content and really honing in with community — that’s extremely valuable, and we value that in our collective.”
Through the Dancing Diaspora Collective, Aviles and Huerta are also able to make sure that dancers and choreographers understand the history behind the pieces and styles they bring to the stage.
“There’s so much. It’s not just about the dancing,” Huerta said. “I think that it’s just so important to know, so that we can really honor the dances that are being presented and know the reason why we have the dances now and all the fusions that we have now.”
Aviles said it’s essential to understand the connectivity between what is considered Latin dance and the reality of its origins. 
“All of our music from Latin social dance comes to us through the African diaspora,” Aviles said. “Salsa, merengue, bachata, cumbia, punta, chota … All of these rhythms come to us through the African diaspora.” 
The disconnect in this historical understanding is what Aviles considers to be just one example of the anti-Blackness that exists prominently within Latinx culture. The community has not addressed it’s inherent colorism, which demonizes a proximity to Blackness and ignores its roots, Aviles said. 
“Being morena and being indígina, you have your Afrodescendientes in every country,” they said. “¿Y si dice que no? Baby you’re in denial and you’re starting to sound like a white supremacist. I am no longer here for that. I am not here anymore for brownness and Latinxness that is like ‘What about us? We need a piece of the pie.’”
In another effort to encourage such dialogue about the cultural history and origins behind dance, Aviles has worked with Conga Kids, a nonprofit organization that typically offered dance classes and programming for fifth and sixth graders in L.A. County. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Conga Kids is now creating a multi-episode series that serves as a journey through the African diaspora and its many dance styles, in which Aviles recently instructed a digital dance video on Roomba. 
Conga Kids executive director Natalie Marrero agrees with Aviles that educating students on the African diaspora and histories of oppression and appropriation is necessary, regardless of age, and said that Aviles’ role is integral in helping young people develop a rich understanding of dance’s origins and purpose. 
“Students are not being given proper education about oppression,” Marrero said. “I think knowing someone who can be really clear and articulate about that — even in an underlying way, even if it’s certain kinds of language used and the inclusivity in the language — that is something I aim for. Therefore [so does] this program I’m creating for young people that are impressionable. They deserve a gateway, even if it’s just uncovering the dust so that they can dive and dive deeper.”
Aviles’ art expression is not encapsulated only through dance, but is also expressed through their writing. What started out as a singular semilla poem, has now turned into “Semilla,” Aviles’ first published collection of poetry that serves as a “reflection of the seeds I’ve planted throughout my life and their outcomes.” 
While Aviles said the process of writing and compiling this collection was not an easy feat, especially considering the many other roles they simultaneously juggle, they said that the support they have already received for the book makes it all worthwhile. 
“At one point, you just learn to let go of our art because you just hope that one person will feel the work that you’re saying,” Aviles said. “These little things, the joy that I get from these conversations, from the random message, from the ‘thank you so much’ — that will always outweigh the arduous work that goes behind it.”
There is no doubt that Aviles has accomplished a lot in their almost 30 years, but above all, coming back home is what they are most proud of. 
“Coming from South Central, we’re told all the time, or at least I was, that success is leaving the hood,” Aviles said. “And I just remember thinking to myself, well what about the people who stay behind? … It’s a reminder that I don’t need to be afraid of my hood the way I’ve been conditioned to think. Even as a femme body, even as a brown body, I choose to not be afraid, and I continue to stay here, and I’m going to continue to live here for as long as I can … These are the streets that brought me up and I always need to be committed to the streets.”

To no one’s surprise, men in the sports media industry have been overly critical of many women they work with. The extensive resumes of women sports reporters such as ESPN’s Maria Taylor and Katie Nolan ought to afford them automatic respect and admiration for how well they do their job in this male-dominated field. However, it seems their work ethic and successes are still not enough to warrant respect from men in the industry. 
For years, women have fought for equality and fairness in sports. The United State’s women’s soccer team filed a lawsuit in 2016 demanding pay and accommodations equal to the U.S. men’s soccer team. Some fans, particularly men, made the argument that payment should be based on the quality of performance — putting that idea into context, though, the women’s soccer team was ranked No. 1 in the world and had higher revenue earnings than men. They were only asking for well-earned recognition and compensation based on their unparalleled success. However, in a decision that frustrated many, the judge did not rule in their favor and the women’s team is now seeking an appeal. 
This also translates back to the treatment of women in sports media. On Sept. 14, Taylor was reporting on a Monday Night Football game for the first time in her career and wore a black shirt that showed her shoulders and collarbone area. Dan McNeil, former host of 670 The Score in Chicago tweeted about Taylor’s wardrobe, writing that she was better-suited to host an adult film awards show instead of an NFL game. McNeil was fired the next day. 
The truth of the matter is men should not feel comfortable speaking on the attire of a woman and should not retort to belittling statements to discredit them. These are the constant problems that women in sports media have to face. The perpetual criticism and comments from men about hair, makeup and attire certainly make it harder for women to focus on what matters and do their jobs effectively — yet they still seem to be doing their job better than a lot of these men: Given that Taylor hosts College Gameday and the NBA Countdown, it can be presumed that her employer, ESPN, sees her as a valuable asset.
ESPN reporter Nolan was recently in a feud with Deadspin reporter Jason Whitlock for his sexist remarks about Nolan and Taylor, including an attempt to diminish Nolan’s accomplishments. 
“Beauty transformed Katie Nolan from bartender to seven-figure personality, Emmy Award-winner and the darling of aroused bloggers and TV critics willing to ignore her pedestrian humor and inability to execute live television,” Whitlock wrote. 
He went on to write that Taylor was hired by ESPN because she is tall and attractive, not because she is an engaging speaker and host. Nolan later locked her Twitter account to no longer allow comments. 
The problem is not so much the employer but rather male employees (such as McNeil) who ought to be allies in the fight against misogynistic and unfair treatment of women in the sports industry but instead choose to take part in this sexist rhetoric. Men in the industry should find themselves on the right side of the fight for protecting women in sports jobs, just as they would (hopefully) do for their daughter or wife. It is conventional wisdom that if one does their job right, they will leave no room for criticism — that statement does not hold true in a society built on systemic oppression. 
This poses a huge problem in the sports media industry, and it seems to be happening more frequently despite the nationwide reckoning on systemic oppression. There is no place for sexist and misogynistic views in the industry. They should be neither tolerated nor allowed. Women should feel safe in any job or space they are in and should be given the security and assurance that they will have that equality, no questions asked. 
The industry is composed of more than 90% men who occupy jobs as hosts, commentators and analysts, according to _____. Though there has started to be more representation of women in the industry, it still is not enough. For the women trying to open doors for more women in the future, it can be discouraging and disheartening to see how they will be treated once they are in a male-dominated workplace. And women are not at fault for the treatment they receive. Taylor could’ve covered every part of her body, and someone would’ve talked about her hair, her makeup or how she misspoke. 
Directly combatting the argument that women have no place talking about sports in an in-depth and analytical fashion are trail-blazers such as Doris Burke, who is known for her analyses and knowledge of the game of basketball. Even then, when virtually no reasonable criticism could be made about her abilities, male spectators still are not satisfied — they want her to dress in a more feminine way. 
All this goes to show that men will never be satisfied with women in sports media. Instead of working with and for these women and encouraging them to occupy more spaces in sports, they turn to misogyny to indulge what are likely feelings of intimidation that arise from working with a capable, eloquent and experienced woman in a men-dominated field. If this industry can seek to fix and acknowledge the unfair treatment of women, specifically at the hands of male commentators, it would create a safer and more just work environment that would be more beneficial to all, employees and viewers alike.

Fear, vigilance and exhaustion. These are feelings commonly shared among Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients here at USC — a worry that the majority of the campus population may never understand the experience of navigating life as an undocumented student. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling blocked the Trump administration from terminating the DACA program in June, students such as Selene Castillo, a sophomore from Guanajuato, Mexico, majoring in Spanish and international relations, felt as though their worries had finally reached a slight pause. 
“We were venting about it every so often,” Castillo said, remembering how she and her roommate felt before the ruling was in place. “Our entire careers depend on this … but what happens if I go into the real world and I can’t work. So what am I going to do? Is my Plan B go to Mexico and try to get a job over there?” 
In July, the Trump administration released a new order on DACA after its ruling had been passed in June. The new memo stated that the Trump administration would not open the program to new applicants and would also limit the DACA renewal period from two years to one. The order comes with a daunting impact: a sharp growth in uncertainty among existing DACA recipients and those who wish to apply.
With the elections quickly approaching, much is at stake for DACA recipients, Castillo said. The Trump administration, if reelected, could bring DACA back to court after the June ruling failed to address the legality of the program itself, meaning the administration could have time to contest it again. 
OBSTACLES AND FEARS
Many DACA recipients are worried about what their next possible steps as undocumented students could look like, causing great uncertainty in their lives. For students including Luis, a junior from Yucatán, Mexico, who wished to withhold his last name for privacy reasons, navigating undocumented status has come hand in hand with navigating barriers.
“Until I was applying for colleges, that’s when I first recognized I was undocumented, just because I never had a need for [DACA] as a senior in high school,” he said. 
When realizing that he was unable to apply for any federal student aid, scholarships or even funding to attend out-of-state universities, Luis knew the hurdles were only starting.
Although he was eligible for the DACA program, Luis chose not to apply since he was seeking a U visa with hopes of gaining authorization to work in the United States. However, Luis just recently received his work authorization after a four year wait. Through unpaid internships, Luis had to adjust to his new normal of not being able to gain the same experience within the workfield as he hoped. 
“I always have to monitor myself that I am not getting into trouble because I know if I were to get in trouble with law enforcement, that can turn into going to a detention center or going through removal proceedings, which I don’t want … even traveling [locally] I have to be cautious … racial profiling from officers, things like that for me I have to take that extra step,” Luis said. 
Castillo, who came to the United States at age 1, said her life has largely revolved around the Supreme Court decision. She said it was difficult to focus on school and grades back in June because her biggest priority was to figure out whether her status would be kept safe to continue the work she had put toward her education. 
“Our entire careers depend on this … but what happens if I go into the real world and I can’t work. So what am I going to do? Is my Plan B go to Mexico and try to get a job over there?”
Castillo said there have been many times in her life when she has debated students who did not understand DACA, often repeating the difficulties she has faced while fighting to obtain a direct, less strenuous path to citizenship in her future. For Castillo, feeling pressured to demonstrate to the U.S. government why she and hundreds of thousands of other undocumented students deserve to continue their lives in the United States is exhausting. She has built her life around American ideals, continued her degree, paid taxes and abided by the law, hoping that a direct path to citizenship can someday weigh true. 
“Regardless, I am going to be here … Why do this to kids like me where I didn’t have a say as to whether I should be brought [to the United States] or not?” Castillo said.
During this time of uncertainty, undocumented students have turned to the organization Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success for information and support. As the assistant director of external affairs, Cenia Martinez has shared legal and immigration updates and advocacy to help students keep up with the latest news regarding DACA status.
“Trying to advocate for centralized support on campus … is the number one mission,” Martinez said. “Having staff who really understand the [undocumented student’s] experience … is one of the biggest things we try to do.”
Similarly, Lorena, a junior from Guanajuato who asked that her last name be omitted for privacy reasons, said coming to the United States at the age of 4, and as a DACA recipient, wasn’t an easy process. Lorena can’t simply reveal her status to others, as she fears what individuals of opposing views may tell her and how they may make her life more difficult. Sometimes, during elementary school, she said she would feel as if she was part of a separate societal bracket. 
“I know I didn’t have an understanding of coming to the United States as the ‘city of dreams’ … until I got older,” Lorena said. “When I arrived, one of the most important things that I realized was the language. I didn’t know how to speak [English] — I didn’t understand it.” 
LIVING WITH DACA
Castillo’s life has revolved around American culture ever since she could remember. However, she is frustrated with constantly having to prove her right to reside in the United States outside of basic DACA protocol to others. 
“I can be Mexican, but my culture, what I know, what my nation [is], this is my nation … I have been taught the ideals of an American, what the flag itself represents,” Castillo said. 
For Lorena, not knowing English as a young child caused her to feel entirely excluded. She faced constant isolation from friend groups and at school and felt targeted and bullied during her adolescence. Comments such as “you can only play with us if you speak English” pushed Lorena to learn the language quickly and to the best of her ability. 
Becoming a part of the USC community has been Lorena’s most prized accomplishment. Her journey began as a student in the Educational Opportunity Program at CSU Los Angeles, seeking a college education after her year break from graduating high school and working to be financially stable. The program granted students like Lorena the chance to overcome social and economic barriers to higher education. 
Because Lorena was attending the program from morning until night to catch up to her college’s curriculum, she found it difficult balancing school with work. Before completing the program, Lorena noticed that she was not being granted any financial assistance due to her undocumented status. 
Lorena said she was lost but not hopeless as her new path turned to community college. 
“I was so devastated,” she said. “Then I went to community college … there was no way anything else was going to stop me. I’m going to go for it … I looked for resources and everything to get through my community college. When I ended up applying to USC and I got in, I took it as a major lesson, I felt like those obstacles were meant to happen to me for a reason. If I would have started at Cal State L.A. … who knows what would have happened.” 
REACHING USC
When she first arrived at USC, Lorena didn’t fully know how she would be able to navigate her financial barriers. Overall, Lorena feels that USC’s organizations such as the Latinx Student Assembly and the Latino Business Student Association have been helpful resources for updates on the status of DACA. However, Lorena is most grateful for her academic adviser for supporting her beyond choosing classes at school and reaching out to DACA programs for Lorena to join.
“Being at [USC] means so much to me,” Lorena said. “It makes me feel like I am here to represent the students who get stereotyped … I’m here to prove to other kids that if I can do it, you can do it too … especially being DACA.” 
Through organizations such as IDEAS, which creates a safe space for undocumented students and allies, Martinez shares a form of fellowship and a community of allies who support students as much as possible. However, Martinez believes the University as a whole should provide a more holistic support system for its undocumented students, since student-run organizations like IDEAS can only do so much. 
At USC’s Immigration Clinic at the Immigrant Legal Assistance Center through the Gould School of Law, staff attorney Jennifer Macias knows that safety and trust is a dire need in the undocumented community at USC. At the clinic, she provides free legal consultations within immigration law for students and their families.
“Knowledge is power … [DACA and being undocumented] is daunting because it’s such a [difficult] situation, but knowing what the possibilities are and having a plan for the future or possibly knowing what your future options can be is super helpful,” Macias said. 
However, Luis feels as though USC doesn’t accommodate to the needs of undocumented students as much as he would expect at such a prestigious university. Though finding partial support within the USC Dream Dollars Scholarship, feeling consoled by USC is not all that easy for Luis, as outside costs beyond University attendance are still barriers he faces.
“The fact that I have to go about and look for [support] is kind of stressful because I feel like there should be someone to accommodate my needs and help me through this process, rather than me having to strangle through one group [or organization] to another to be able to get information and resources,” Luis said. “USC needs to do a better job of consolidating and voicing that [organizations] are available for [DACA] students … being more inclusive on how [USC] does programming as well.” 
Lorena said the emotional roller coasters she has faced have shaped her into the woman she is today. Her determination and perseverance hold a voice that represents DACA students as a whole and reflect that she is meant to be where she is no matter what odds are against her.
“I want to be able to inspire any friends I have ever made,” she said, “whether they are DACA or not.”

After several weeks of activism by Armenian students, President Carol Folt addressed the ongoing deadly conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in a series of tweets on Monday saying that USC would provide support to those affected.
“The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh is weighing heavily on the minds of many at USC and across L.A., home to the largest Armenian population outside of Armenia,” Folt wrote. 
Her posts also encouraged students to take advantage of mental health resources, attend educational events presented by the USC Institute of Armenian Studies and highlighted efforts from the Keck School of Medicine to provide medical resources to the region. 
The four tweets came after Armenian students, led by Ani Sarkisyan and Ani Matevosyan, along with the Armenian Student Association, ran an email-writing campaign urging USC administrators to take action. 
Armenian students said they were disappointed with the University’s lack of response since the resurgence of conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, where tensions have been rocky since a truce in 1994. 
Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Artsakh, is located to the east of Turkey and is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan even though its government is backed by Armenia. The hostility between the two nations foments as a result of religious, cultural and political divisions.
In 1988, the national assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh, an area populated mostly by ethnic Armenians, voted to join neighboring Armenia. Azerbaijan, the former Soviet province that had controlled the area previously, launched a series of attacks against Armenia when the Soviet Union collapsed. After several years of war, a ceasefire between the two nations temporarily eased tensions. 
In recent years, ceasefires between the two nations have been violated. Most recently, Azerbaijan, along with the support of Turkey, has launched offensive attacks to strengthen its control of the disputed territory. As the situation escalates, Armenians fear another attempt by Turkey and Azerbaijan to systemically target the Armenian people. 
“Whole towns in the region are being shelled with missiles, towns are being evacuated and intense fighting is going on between the border of Karabakh and Azerbaijan,” said Syuzanna Petrosyan, associate director of the Institute of Armenian Studies. 
For the approximately 1,000 Armenian students at USC, Armenian Student Association President Aureen Aghajanian said the reignited conflict has fueled worry for family and friends in the country. 
“For most of us, we all have family involved in this conflict,” said Matevosyan, a senior working at the Institute of Armenian studies. “For me, my dad went to Armenia a day before all this started. So I’m constantly checking in with him.”
Matevosyan’s family has been directly affected by the clashes. She, like many other Armenian students, is living under the perpetual fear of losing her loved ones to the violence. 
“My own cousins are fighting on the front lines,” she said, “and so every time there’s a list of soldiers who have passed away in the conflicts, I’m constantly checking up with that, making sure they’re not on that list.”
Sarkisyan said the conflict has affected her mental health, making it difficult to concentrate in classes. 
“It’s really hard to want to focus on the already straining Zoom semester,” Sarkisyan said. “I constantly find myself glued to my phone as much as I try not to be within my classes; I’m always constantly checking on the news.”
Sarkisyan said that Folt’s tweets were a starting point to address the conflict, but she hopes to see a schoolwide email pointing students, faculty and staff to resources and educating people on the conflict. 
“L.A. is an area with a very large Armenian population,” Sarkisyan said. “I think as a USC student, as someone who identifies with USC in their identity, it should be your responsibility to educate yourself on this, and USC should state that in their letter. That’s the main thing I would want to see added.”
Aghajanian said Folt’s statements on Twitter lacked nuance. 
“It’s better than nothing, but it’s definitely disappointing,” Aghajanian said. “We are demanding that she actually comes out with an official schoolwide email, not just an email sent out to everyone who sent her an email about this issue.” 
ASA has been working with local companies to fundraise for the Armenians in Karabakh. Aghajanian said that students have raised nearly $20,000. The IMX Auto Group in Burbank matched the donation by $15,000 and Focus on Children Now, an Armenian nonprofit, added an additional $35,000 bringing the total to $70,000. According to Aghajanian, all the proceeds will be donated to the Armenia Fund.
On Oct. 8, the Undergraduate Student Government also released a statement in conjunction with ASA affirming their support of the Armenian cause.
“C​hoosing to disregard this issue endangers the lives of ​our Armenian students and friends, their families, their nation, their past, and their future,” the statement read. “The members of ASA and USG stand in solidarity with our local Armenian community, both on and off campus, and implore our student body, professors, and the administration to do the same.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated IMS Auto Group as the local company that donated to the Armenian Student Association when it was instead made by the IMX Auto Group. Donations raised by ASA were also not updated day of publication. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

At the closing celebration for USC’s Latinx Heritage Month, President Carol Folt spoke with American labor leader and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta about her work with the farmworkers’ movement and the need for political activism. The event was hosted by La CASA, the Latinx Leadership Roundtable, USC University Relations and USC Cultural Relations and University Events. At the start of the ceremony, Huerta discussed the importance of engaging in community activism and participating in political events such as elections and the census. She also emphasized the impact that individuals can have on the political and social environment around them.
“A lot of people think that ‘Well, I really can’t make any difference, my vote doesn’t matter,’ but they don’t realize that if all of us put in a little bit of time … It gives all of us a great opportunity to become activists,” Huerta said. “Please get involved, even if it means just making a few phone calls asking people to register to vote.” 
Huerta herself has participated and led numerous political movements. Along with fellow labor leader and activist Cesar Chavez, Huerta founded the United Farm Workers — the first enduring and largest union for farmworkers in the United States. Since its inception in 1962, UFW and Huerta have worked to improve wages and working conditions for farm laborers. 
In her conversation with Folt, Huerta explained that the key to effective activism is bravery, which she witnessed during the farmworkers’ movement.
“We have to teach people, we have to make them understand that they have power and not to give up,” Huerta said. “You can imagine how difficult it was for farmworkers because there was so much fear that they would be fired and they wouldn’t have any work. So making them understand that they had that power gave them the courage to go on strike and go on marches and go all over the country to do boycotts and ask people to support them. Of course, we won because we had 17 million people in the United States that listened to the farmworkers.”
Huerta, who is now 90 years old, talked about how her upbringing inspired her to become the activist she is today. Her roots in political action started at a young age, she said, as her father was involved in politics in her home state of New Mexico.
“I believe that I was 8 years old when I found a bumper sticker and I put it on somebody’s car to vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” Huerta said. “My father was an assemblyman in the state of New Mexico … So I was very fortunate in that respect, to know the importance of voting and the importance of being engaged.” 
During the webinar, Folt discussed how many USC students are already participating in various activism efforts. Folt also acknowledged the farmworkers’ movement as an important aspect of history for students. 
“I think you’d be really proud that our students have been pushing for many initiatives like this on campus,” Folt said in response to Huerta’s voter participation efforts. “I have got a renewed spirit for getting people to do the census, but it’s our students who are really the ones leading, and I think hearing from you is really important to them.”
Kamy Akhavan, executive director of the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future, attended the event and shared his thoughts on Huerta, who he considered to be one of the most important feminists in American history.
“Dolores Huerta is a civil rights icon, and she has influenced millions and millions of people, so I expected to see the older version of a formerly very dynamic accomplished woman,” Akhavan said. “And what I got was a very accomplished dynamic woman who is 90 years old, and continues to inspire and be engaging and delightful, humorous and absolutely committed to the causes she holds dear.” 
Huerta also shared her experiences working with farmworkers to create social change. 
“I think the moment when the farmworkers came out on strike was a great moment because people are literally walking off of their jobs, and the strike went on for five years,” she said. “They stood out there for five years just picketing and doing the work that had to be done.” 
Toward the end of the ceremony, Huerta spoke on the current politically charged climate in the United States. She also told the audience that they need to be the change they want to see in the world and that the most important thing to do right now is to care for one another.
“The main thing is that we have to learn that we are the only ones that can change this. We really can’t wait for somebody to come in on a white horse and do it for us, it’s up to us,” Huerta said. “I think the pandemic has shown us that we have to take care of each other. I just want to remind everybody that we are one human race.” 
Isabel Gonzalez, a junior studying communication, found the ceremony with Huerta inspiring and resonated with Huerta’s comment about unity. She also said that she was amazed by Huerta’s eagerness to teach.
“She was so motivated and she had a lot of energy, and just the motivation to pass on information and share her knowledge at her age,” Gonzalez said. “I think that that’s really inspirational that even at her age, she’s still making an impact.”

The Undergraduate Student Government presented a resolution Tuesday calling on city officials to push landlords to let college students out of their leases and provide rent subsidies. 
The resolution comes after the USC administration said it met with landlords ahead of the online fall semester but failed to negotiate new lease terms.
USG’s Committee Chair for External Affairs Chris Perez presented the Tenant Protections Resolution that asks Los Angeles City Council to implement policies that would allow students to end the terms of their leases, mandate leasing companies waive re-letting fees and provide rent relief for college students. According to the resolution, lease termination would be subject to students’ ability to provide documentation that proves the coronavirus has substantially impacted them. 
The resolution also calls on USG and the Graduate Student Government to work with local representatives and other university student governments in L.A. to create and support initiatives for student relief amid the pandemic. Perez and GSG Director for External Affairs David Angel co-authored the resolution. 
During the meeting, Perez said the resolution was a response to approximately 16,000 students in the Exposition Park neighborhood facing some form of housing difficulty since the pandemic forced classes online. After USC reneged in August on its initial plan to hold fall semester classes in person, students found themselves stuck in leases they no longer had use for or could no longer afford.
“The issue is that students have a variety of scenarios,” Perez said. “Some students don’t want to come to USC because of health concerns … some students have reduced financial aid and cannot afford their leases because of COVID-19’s effect on their family’s income … other students just don’t think it’s warranted to pay for leases that are upwards of $10,000 at large leasing companies that they will not use.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Sen. Max Gomez, who co-sponsored the resolution along with Sen. Julian Lin, highlighted the public health implications for students who felt the need to return to campus because landlords and leasing companies would not allow them to terminate their lease agreements. 
“I’m sure you’ve heard of struggles with having too many roommates and dealing with COVID in a time like this,” Gomez said. “During normal times you sacrifice some privacy or getting kicked out of the room every once in a while [but now] you’re risking contamination from COVID.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Perez said the main obstacle preventing the City Council from implementing a policy that would allow students to terminate their leases is the prospect of legal retaliation from landlords and leasing companies against the city.
“We’ve had meetings with city representatives and for the most part they are committed not just to helping students but tenants across Los Angeles,” Perez said. “The main barrier to this policy change … is the risk of lawsuit. If they were to lose these lawsuits it would create millions of dollars of losses for them.”
California state law gives landlords the prerogative to collect any unpaid rent, Perez said. Because of the power landlords and their leasing companies hold, Perez said he believes that the resolution could serve as a platform to engender meaningful student mobilization.
“The reason why I’m pursuing this resolution is not just to create support for students — although that is a reason we are going to vote on this — but rather, it is a process to create visibility on the issue so that it helps our advocacy work,” Perez said. “Ultimately we won’t convince legislators unless we make phone calls, people send emails, they go to council meetings and submit public comments — this resolution is the starting point to not only mobilize our students but other universities as well to really talk to L.A. City Council and say, ‘Hey, this is an issue that impacts us.’”
Next week, the resolution will be open for debate and amendments and will be voted on afterward.
Correction: The article misidentified Chris Perez’s position as Director for External Affairs. He is the Committee Chair for External Affairs. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

With the conference’s football season less than a month away, parents of Pac-12 football players organized a petition Monday requesting a plan be put together for them to watch games in person. 
The petition was organized by Sahaja Douglass, the mother of USC sophomore offensive guard Liam Douglass. At the time of publication, the petition had amassed almost 3,000 signatures, with the number growing rapidly. It is addressed to Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott,  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Mayor Eric Garcetti and governors of states with Pac-12 schools, demanding a feasible plan be developed before the season begins. 
Unlike other Power Five conferences such as the SEC, the Pac-12 emphasized in its return statement that no fans will be allowed to attend games. The SEC, on the other hand, allows each school to decide whether or not fans can enter as long as they follow specific guidelines. 
The petition reads that social distancing at games can easily be accomplished. Most outdoor Pac-12 stadiums can seat between 50,000 to 80,000 people, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which seats 77,500. 
“We believe that this can be done safely in open air stadiums while adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols mandated for businesses,” the petition reads.
The petition also mentions that all recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, such as wearing masks and checking temperatures, are easy to follow, and that face shields are also readily available at many drug stores. 
“If any safety modifications are needed (i.e., opening an extra entrance or two, or providing hand sanitizers in the bathrooms), there is ample time to put in place whatever is needed to ensure the safety of all,” the petition reads. 
The petition highlights it is “important for the emotional health of the football players in the [Pac-12] — many who are still teens — and their families that family members be allowed to offer traditional support while they play weekly games.”
USC is slated to play past the end of classes this semester, including a game on Thanksgiving weekend. The petition argues that this schedule leads to less family time available for young athletes, and with programs enforcing rapid testing and contact tracing protocols, trips home may not be possible for some players.
“Just as the community at large yearns for the upcoming football games, we yearn to cheer for our boys as we have done every season since they started playing football in the youth leagues,” the petition reads.
As the Nov. 7 start rapidly approaches, the Pac-12 has yet another decision to make.

After nine months of being out of the pads, members of the Trojan offensive line are getting back into the rhythm and pace of full-contact practice as they focus on building chemistry at the line of scrimmage. 
With talent like redshirt junior offensive linemen Brett Neilon, Jalen McKenzie, Andrew Vorhees and Alijah Vera-Tucker returning, experience will be key. The group will look to find the combination that works best and ease the learning curve for more inexperienced linemen. Redshirt senior Liam Jimmons and redshirt sophomore Justin Dedich will battle for a starting spot on the line, while rising newcomers freshmen Casey Collier and Caadyn Stephen will fight for time in the trenches as well.
“You got guys with lots of experience out there — we got to figure out the best five and how we can piece them together to give us the best chance,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said in a virtual press conference Tuesday. “We’re probably gonna have to play a combination of a lot of those guys and then behind them we have guys that don’t have much experience but are really, really talented.” 
Neilon expressed his confidence and enthusiasm to work with the rising linemen on technique and using their athleticism to be a consistent force against opponents.  
“The first thing that stands out is their size; very big group, very long group like [Collier], super long arms, very tall, same with [freshman offensive lineman] Andres [Dewerk], very tall, very big; [freshman offensive lineman] Courtland [Ford], I mean, you go down the list — they’re big guys and they are actually grasping the offense really well so far,” Neilon said. “I think they’re doing good things and I think they’re gonna be very special and some of them are gonna have to contribute for sure.”
Harrell and Neilon both were excited to see Vera-Tucker return to the lineup, which Vera-Tucker said was a decision that had been on his mind since the minute the Pac-12 announced a conference-only season Sept. 24.
Vera-Tucker said he looks forward to leading the process of building chemistry with the group of linemen and starting to ramp up speed of practice and processing coverage.
“Well, first off, it took a lot of thought,” Vera-Tucker said about deciding to return. “Definitely was something that I thought about as soon as they announced the football season was returning. That’s when I thought, ‘Why not come back and compete with my brothers, you know, compete for a Pac-12 Championship?’”
Though the offensive line, unlike other position groups on the team, can look to its depth to help protect sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis’ blind side, the group did lose players like Austin Jackson, one of three former USC offensive tackles now playing in the NFL. USC’s success in transitioning linemen to the NFL speaks to the type of production that Harrell and offensive line coach Tim Drevno expect from their group. 
Looking beyond the line, one spot the Trojans will also look to fill is the one left by the graduation of wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. Harrell sees two-sport standout and sophomore wide receiver Drake London stepping up. 
As a freshman, London started nine games and collected 567 yards and five touchdowns across 39 receptions. 
“Drake London is as talented of a player as I’ve been around,” Harrell said. “To combine the size that he has with his body control and stuff like that, and his ball skills, his toughness, I think that he creates a natural matchup.”
As Harrell enters his second year with USC, he feels confident in perfecting his Air Raid offense and other familiar techniques rather than relying primarily on unpredictable schemes. 
“Our philosophy offensively is to just go do what you do and be really good at it,” Harrell said. “I don’t think that people will completely go away from who they are … but at the same time, we’ll be ready for whatever they have, whatever they throw at us.”

It has only been two weeks since I published my column about “Among Us,” and a new game has already taken the world by storm: “Genshin Impact.” Defining the game is tough,  especially for those who are not used to gaming lingo. Here’s my best attempt: 
Genshin Impact is a free, open-world online role-playing game (RPG) with gacha elements. It is currently available for mobile, PS4 and PC. Now, I understand this is still pretty dense, so let’s break it down. 
Being an open-world online RPG means that it is not divided into stages; the game allows you to explore the world from the start. The game uses a leveling-up system with different classes the player can pick and items to collect (aka loot). 
This leads us to gacha. Borrowing from the Japanese capsule prize machines called “Gachapon,” the word means that a player expends currency to try to acquire a character or item. In that sense, it is very similar to the loot box system, except that loot boxes do not usually lock characters away from you. 
This system may seem harsh, and it certainly is. Players acquire a legendary character or item in Genshin Impact only 0.6% of the time. There is a pity system that guarantees a five-star character after the player tries 90 times. But even so, getting to that number requires an insane amount of dedication. 
Or maybe just a lot of money.
The game allows you to acquire the currency needed to try for a character simply by playing. But it can take a long time, so there is also the option of buying it. Add that to the pressure of limited characters, and you can start to understand how, even though Genshin Impact is a free game, it still managed to rake in $60 million in its first week. And that’s only the mobile revenue, excluding the money made on PS4 and PC. 
Speaking of mobile, we finally get to the point of this column: Genshin Impact proves why mobile games should be taken more seriously by the esports community — it’s all about money.
I know this makes me look pragmatic, but the esports community gaining more money is beneficial for everyone. As much as I like to use the term, there is no such thing as a “community” when it comes to esports companies. They are simply business partners. With the pandemic, the very definition of an esports company has been put under debate, as streamers can now seek sponsorships and host their own tournaments. 
When I talk about the “community,” I am referring to the professional gamers that compose it. And unlike big corporations, these people could benefit from some extra cash, especially since only a few manage to live off of their passion.
In concrete terms, this means that athletes follow along the lines of content creators and make a channel on a streaming platform. But unlike the latter, they should seek to diversify their content and center their professional skills. This would entail creating connections with fellow athletes and constantly collaborating, as well as hosting their tournaments. 
They could even have sessions where they challenge viewers or give video game lessons. A lot of it will depend on what game the athlete focuses on, but the core element should always be a sense of community. Athletes can be really popular, so there should be a lot of people interested in talking directly to them. And if what matters is the community element, then the athletes should feel comfortable to expand outside of their comfort zone if that is what’s popular. 
This is where Genshin Impact comes in. Usually, professional gamers might be hesitant to adopt mobile gaming — probably because it does not translate well to their skills or prepare them for tournaments, since most of the popular esports games are made for PC or console.  
But, if they follow the steps above, adopting mobile games would prove to be more beneficial because they are so popular and rake in so much money. Genshin Impact is the latest one, but many other mobile games have made headlines with earnings like the $4 billion revenue from Fate/Grand Order last year. 
If professional gamers hop onto these trends and bring their professional skills and network, they have the potential to create new content and earn big. In turn, they are less reliant on companies to make a living and can also innovate the gaming industry by introducing a blend of professionalism and casual gaming that has never been done before. 
I know how complicated this sounds, but it really is simple at the end of the day. All I am suggesting is that professional gamers create their streams and branch out to find the perfect mix between insane skill and community engagement. This happens by gamers hopping onto trends.
 If they earnestly give it a try and communicate with one another, there is a high chance that we may get a new form of content for successful, highly-watched video games such as Genshin Impact even if the games are made for mobile. For them, this means gaining financial independence and more freedom to live off what they love. And if what stops professional gamers from gaining economic autonomy is a lack of adaptation to trends, then at least they can rest well knowing the problem is easy to fix.

Despite the pandemic disrupting many collegiate athletics and activities, the prestigious Oracle Intercollegiate Tennis Association Masters hosted its 2020 tournament in a singles-only format last weekend at Barnes Tennis Center in San Diego. Schools all over the nation participated in this year’s tournament, including Wake Forest, UCLA and Pepperdine in addition to some professional athletes. Over the course of the tournament, former and current Trojans dominated the competition, convincingly winning both the men’s and women’s titles. 
On the women’s side, Trojan sophomore Eryn Cayetano and her teammate redshirt senior Angela Kulikov defeated their respective opponents to square off against each other for an all-USC final. The duo, who make up one of USC’s best doubles teams, competed in a long, arduous match on Sunday with Cayetano prevailing in a tiebreaker, 3-6, 6-2, 1-0 (10).
“It felt special to win the first major tournament I’ve played in since beginning competition again,” Cayetano said after the final. “Plus, it was really special to compete against one of my idols, my teammate Angela. During the match, it was hard to separate the emotions of how I was feeling competing against her. ”
Throughout the pandemic, Cayetano demonstrated her volunteerism and compassion toward the Filipino community by donating tennis racquets and other goods to those facing difficulty in her family’s home country in the Philippines. 
“When the trophy ceremony happened, I was so grateful to represent USC and the Filipino community,” Cayetano said.
Likewise, head coach Alison Swain had high praise for Cayetano and Kulikov’s outstanding run in spite of the tough competition.
“Eryn’s path to the title was definitely a challenging one playing some of the top college players and pros en route to the championship,” Swain said. “[Cayetano] and Angela are outstanding examples of Trojan values on and off the court. They both displayed the great competitors they are, but also their integrity, sportsmanship and professionalism during this event.”
Many current and former Trojans took part on the men’s side. Alumni Brandon Holt, Logan Smith and Raymond Sarmiento as well as juniors Bradley Frye and Jake Sands all competed, but it was Holt who reigned supreme. 
Holt, who previously won the singles tournament as a sophomore in 2017, faced tough opponents in his quest for the title including former Trojan teammate Frye in the quarterfinal, where he triumphed 4-6, 6-3, 1-0 (10-3). 
In the finals match, Holt faced 2020 ITA All-American and Rookie of the Year sophomore Cannon Kingsley from Ohio State. Holt easily won, 6-3, 6-1.  
Along with Frye, who made the quarterfinal, other Trojans were able to go far in the tournament as both Sarmiento and Sands made the round of 16 and Smith reached the quarterfinal through the back draw. 
Despite the hurdles 2020 has thrown the Trojan tennis teams through the canceled spring season and uncertain restart for the fall, the players, coaches and staff still managed to climb to the podium at one of the most important competitions of the season.

After weeks of tumult related to school, well-being and life in general, I decided to embark on a journey, one that could turn my brain off in the absence of a complete lobotomy. 
Always interested in the best and most healthy solutions, I turned back to my computer screen and browsed Netflix for a bit of quick viewing. ’Tis the season, so the algorithm blessed my home page with recommendations of thrillers, horror flicks and super bloody slashers. Among the Top 10 most viewed list is “Ratched,” a TV adaptation focused on the sociopathic namesake in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” created by the minds of Evan Romansky and none other than Mr. Ryan Murphy. 
All roads lead to Ryan. Even the jade, off-putting poster for “Ratched,” featuring its main star Sarah Paulson, fired the neurons in my brain to alert me to one of the minds behind the operation, and by consequence, its quality. 
Now Murphy is not short of critical accolades, winning Emmy awards for “American Crime Story,” “The Normal Heart,” “Glee” and more than 70 other nominations in other venues. He is incredibly prolific, with credits in directing, writing and producing in the 20, 30 and 40 range, respectively. Murphy is omnipresent — he sees you when you’re sleeping and knows when you’re awake — and chances are, you’re going to watch one of his shows. 
Does the quality over quantity rule apply here? Or can he balance quality with his output? How can Murphy create a masterpiece like “Pose,” a cultural touchstone like “Glee” (no further questions on that one) and also create … “The Politician?”
I think these are more personal questions than what really needs to be addressed in terms of Murphy and the potential of his reach. 
After making a name for himself by adapting the feature film of “Eat Pray Love,” hitting his stride with “Nip/Tuck” and moving on to other cable home runs with Fox and FX, Murphy followed in the footsteps of other major creators like Shonda Rhimes and collaborator Janet Mock to strike a deal within the streaming world. Finally leaving Fox in 2018, Murphy signed an agreement — rumored to be valued at a record-breaking $300 million — which, to this day, is “the most lucrative TV pact in history,” according to Time. 
For context, deals like these, though unwelcome at the start and still scrutinized by some of the old fogies still around, kill two birds with one stone. Industry creatives who have the talent AND the audience behind their projects to transfer over to a streaming platform can use this money and freedom to pretty much hit the boundaries of their film and TV imaginations. Companies such as Netflix, which in 2019 reported –$3.27 billion in free cash flow and $14.76 in long-term debt, can tell their stockholders to refer to their staggering $24.5 billion net value in content assets and say, “We are investing in these creators to deliver the original content that sets us apart from the other guys.”
For the individual side, this is a great opportunity to take advantage of these resources, especially for a guy like Murphy who can have around 15 projects that he’s working on at any given time. 
But let’s go back to my first reaction in seeing the poster for “Ratched” and predicting he was behind the show in some form. You can do this exercise with me — name five actors that work regularly on Murphy’s shows (not your favorites) and once you have them, we can compare. I thought of course of Sarah Paulson, but also Emma Roberts (because her “Scream Queens” line “Learn to make a pumpkin spice latte, you psychopath” is one of my intrusive holiday thoughts), Jessica Lange, Gwenyth Paltrow and Evan Peters. There’s the pattern.
Whatever the circumstances may be, Murphy is prone to cast white celebrities and feature white narratives, and no — him or some of his actors identifying as gay is not a placebo to the extensive whiteness in his creations. This is especially glaring when, not only the most talked about, but some of the most cherished characters in the Murphy universe are played by Black and Indigenous actors and actors of color such as MJ Rodriguez, Naya Rivera and Darren Criss. 
So no, I don’t really need another snippy historical drama that speaks to feuds between the great Hollywood divas of the past. I don’t need to revisit 2012-era Tumblr to see posts upon posts of girls way too young to be watching “American Horror Story” wishing for a *trigger warning* school-shooter boyfriend *end trigger warning* to smoke half a cigarette with them for the rest of eternity. And I certainly don’t need another cop-adjacent drama, or whatever his upcoming miniseries on Jeffrey Dahmer is going to end up like.
Murphy has an incredible chance and such immense creative leverage — and probably one of the few of this generation to receive it — to, for the most part, just appeal to the white, male, gay millenial audience that clap with their glass of white wine in their hand whenever they hear Sharon Stone deliver a snappy one-liner or those who “live” for Ben Platt’s turtleneck-blazer combo. While Murphy fits within that same identity, he has the opportunity — but for me, it is a responsibility — to amplify voices and stories other than the ones that he has trudged along in his journey. 
Do I have high hopes for him to achieve this? Not really. As Twitter user @The_SummerMan said, it seems like for story development, “He just be clicking around Wikipedia having a ball.” And with eight of his shows kicking off their shooting schedules this month and the next, what we will likely end up with is more pieces of media that we can throw on top of the growing and inaccessible mountain of content that we increasingly have no use for.

Young Indigenous children grow up with minuscule representation on the screen. If they see themselves, it is normally a Western representation of Native Americans. Over time, filmmaking regarding Natives has felt disingenuous as it tends to be created by non-Natives. 
The zealous lust and romanticization of Manifest Destiny have been detrimental to all Native American people. The filmmakers showcased at Native American Short Films Showcase are game-changing creators of thought-prowling and educationally valuable films. 
In honor of the third Annual Indigenous People’s Day in Los Angeles, the USC School of Cinematic Arts, in conjunction with L.A. Skins Fest, USC Visions and Voices, Outside the Box [Office] and Our Voices put on a festival of short films created by Indigenous filmmakers.
The showcase included short films by Indigenous filmmakers from Alaska, Hawaii, California and Colorado. 
Four movies were in the line-up, shown back to back. Each of the filmmakers spoke after the screenings and were asked questions by moderator, SCA MFA candidate and Norman Topping graduate fellow Kapena Baptista. 
“I always love to hear stories about communities lifting each other up,” Baptista said. “I think it’s really important for [Native Americans] to do that especially since we’re already so underrepresented and marginalized in a slew of different ways.” 
Spoiler warning!
“Gently, Jennifer”
The first film shown was directed by Doane Tulagaq Avery, an L.A.-based filmmaker whose films focus on stories of  queer, feminine and Indigenous characters. She has a unique eye and gift for surrealism. 
“Gently, Jennifer” is a bildungsroman about two teenage girls discussing body image while peeking at an older brother’s magazine. The film’s opening shots utilize pink coloring and room decor to make the audience aware of the time period. 
Rhetoric about sexuality between the two girls is endearing and realistic to the viewer. In an excellently pulled off plot twist, one of the girls kisses the model in the magazine and falls into the magazine’s universe. 
She is greeted by the model seductively enticing her to the tune of the ever popular ’80s hit “Safety Dance.” The girl stares in awe at the beautiful woman until she realizes she is trapped. Her friend saves her and she admits to her friend she believes she is gay. The end of the film ends on a close in of the two girls’ hands reaching toward one another. 
“Gently, Jennifer” is a wonderful combination of great music, heartwarming stories and charming characters. 
“Growing up I did not see myself at all,” Avery said. “As a Native person, as a queer person, you know … it was just lacking. If you want to bring any kind of honesty to something you want to lend something of yourself and find that vulnerable place.”
“Douk”
A shift in tone from the lighthearted 80’s romp prior, “Douk” is a heavy-hitting film about the reality of being Native during the early 1900s. 
Director Michelle Hernandez based the characters off her great grandmother and another woman she met while growing up on the Table Bluff Reservation. 
The gripping film discussed the Native American boarding schools. “Indian” boarding schools were created with the sole purpose of erasing American Indian traditions and forcing them to assimilate into mainstream culture. The schools were often founded by Christian missionaries.
The film centers on two sisters and their parents. The oldest sister understands the danger and knows what is occurring, and as a 14-year-old, she sacrifices herself at the hands of the man kidnapping her in front of her family to save her sister. 
Hernandez creates a high-stakes environment in a narrative-driven educational film. She shared with the panel that her intention behind the film was for school teachers to include it in their curriculum about Native Americans. 
“We really don’t talk about how families dealt with [Native boarding schools],” Hernandez said. “I wanted to make my family very human and I felt like [Native Americans] aren’t seen as human often. We’re seen as stoic people and I wanted to tell the story of a family having their children taken.”
“Escape” 
The Youth of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe created the third film shown. Representing the film in the discussion was star and writer Kamea Clark. 
“Escape” uses mockumentary style interviews to frame the story. The story in question is of two misfit teens who contemplate taking their own lives in a “beautiful plan.”
Clark plays the protagonist, Rachel, who has absent parents and an abusive home life. The other protagonist, Adam, is a young man who protects her against the bullies at school. Rachel and Adam feel isolated as if they only had each other in their violent hometown of Towaoc, Colo. 
In the final chapter of the film, the two teens decide against taking their own lives. Rachel gains the confidence to stand up to her bullies and Adam leaves the town, escaping his abusive alcoholic father. 
Summing up the movie in one word would simply be: authentic. The authenticity in the film is palpable. The Youth wrote, directed and created the film and due to the realism of sharing their own stories, the film carries a heavy-handed, bona fide story. 
“It was really tough to play those roles,” Clark said. “Especially because I related so much to some of the problems in the film like drug abuse and alcohol, I had a lot of family members who dealt with that. It was coming from my own personal place.” 
“Ka Piko”
The final film of the night was “Ka Piko,” a beautiful film by Bryson Chun. The imagery used by Chun quickly engaged the audience. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. 
Chun premiered “Ka Piko” at the Hawaii International Film Festival in 2017, where it was nominated for “Best Short.” In 2019, “Ka Piko” was selected for inclusion in the Native Cinema Showcase by The Smithsonian’s National Museum of The American Indian.
Visual storytelling played a large part in the film. The story follows Makana, a Native Hawaiian man, who finds difficulty with his tenuous connection to his culture. After his girlfriend dies during childbirth, he sets out on a journey to complete a traditional Indigenous birthing ritual with his girlfriend’s father, with whom he does not get along.
The two men set out on a journey that takes them to Mauna Kea. On the trip, the men bond and promise to work together to create a healthy, prosperous relationship to aid them in the future. 
Additionally, the film has phenomenal acting; there is little dialogue and the two men act together excellently. The final scene has a burst of music that sends a shock down one’s spine and penetrates every ounce of emotion within. 
The final scene is filmed at Mauna Kea, a historical site on the Big Island of Hawaii. 
“Our origin story comes from [Mauna Kea] and I think it is something tangible,” Chun said. “It can be problematic to film at a place like that. We went there and the Munna, the sacred power, is palpable there. I know it’s like I’m speaking in hyperbole but you can feel a connection to it.”
Opinion from a Native Identifying journalist and human 
The film festival, in general, has been one of the most surreal moments of my life. Seeing people who represented my ancestors’ stories in an honest, authentic way is something I’ll never forget. 
One of the questions posed to the panel during the Q&A has been sitting on my soul. 
A student from the audience asked what the panelists, a group of Native filmmakers, thought about white or non-Native storytellers including Native characters in their films. 
The panelists chuckled and each one shared they think the time for that is over. There are so many Indigenous storytellers out there raring to be given the opportunity to share their films with mainstream audiences. 
I shared the questions with a close friend of my mine, a cis white male and a recent SCA graduate. 
We had an open dialogue where I came to terms with the actuality of mine and other Black and Indigenous writers and writers’ of color futures.
Regardless of the seamless perfection we want, it is unlikely we will be the first ones in the room where it happens. 
Instead, we have to continue to push our peers who are in the room to include us and to provide authenticity in their scripts and stories. My friend and I came to an understanding. 
As a white storyteller, he will continue to include Black and Indigenous characters and characters of color in his writing as long as he uses other BIPOC writers to authenticate the experiences and stories. 
Elevating Black and Indigenous writing and writing by people of color in cinema will be changing with the new Oscar qualifications requiring diversity on set, behind the scenes and on screen. Hopefully, the future will show a place where Black and Indigenous writers and writers of color are treated the same as white writers.

Allen Smith, who always wore headphones and listened to music as a kid, started playing the piano when he was 5 years old. By the time he was a senior in high school, he started his own digital music production company. Under it, he released his first solo album this year, “Blood Orange.”
Smith, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, began uploading mix-tracks on Soundcloud when he was 16 while he worked as a DJ. A year later Smith, his sister Angel, and his cousins created the company Esoteric Creations in 2018. He described his music production company as family oriented, since they are all related to one another and they used to create music whenever they hung out.  
“So we all really like self-meditated and introspective[ly] figured-out like who we are, what we want to do in the world, what influence we want to have in this world, and they all really like lined up, like we all really had the same passions,” Smith said. “So we said, OK, like, let’s officially start [ESO] for each other.”
ESO specializes in mixing and mastering music, but the team also writes their own lyrics and produces various hip-hop and R&B songs, with some jazz vibes. Smith runs production and marketing for the company but is also one of its recording artists.
According to Smith, the company has a transcendent aspect that aims to brighten people’s lives. Allen said the company is dedicated to uplifting artists across all mediums, including visual and digital arts and music, to create positive energy within the community.
“It’s so people can feel connected, it’s so people can feel understood, and like they’re not alone in whatever they’re going through,” Smith said.  
Smith was born in Chicago and raised in Northwest Indiana. Throughout high school, he experienced racial aggressions, as he and his sister were two of the few Black students at his school.
“I’ve had friends [in high school] who’ve been called the n-word, I’ve been called the n-word before,” Smith said. “There’s students walking around with Confederate flags on their shirts, on their belts, on their trucks and meeting in the parking lot of the school, all of them with their trucks, it’s just like, intimidation.”
Continuous striving forward, Smith applied to many universities during his last year of high school and finally arrived at USC. He said he was inspired by his sister, who was admitted to Stanford University.
At the University, Smith is a member of the USC Concerts Committee and helps set up and promote welcome back events and concerts. 
“I think [Allen is] just so passionate about music that he wants to be in every part of that process,” ESO co-founder Angel Smith, a senior at Stanford and Allen’s sister, said. “Whether that’s putting on events, or making them be or freestyling with an artist – he wants to be there if there’s music he’s there, and so, I think that passion for him is what drives him in every facet of his life.”
While Smith was working on a group album titled “Genesis,” he also released individual tracks that gained traction on social media, prompting him to create his own album.
In 2020, two years after founding ESO, Smith released his debut solo album “Blood Orange” on Aug. 1 on Spotify. The album combines hip-hop and R&B genres on tracks such as “God is a Black Woman” and “Daydream.”
“I made “Blood Orange,” basically, so that people can feel connected and people can feel understood,” Smith said.
Smith created “God Is a Black Woman” in collaboration with his sister Angel to honor the Black women in his life, including his mother, sister and women leaders in Black rights movements throughout history. The pair based the song off one of its lines,“Tell me that a woman ain’t God, when a woman gave me everything I got.” 
Smith also spoke about the song “Daydream,” and how it derived from the times he feels alone, even when surrounded by many people. He hopes people can relate to it while being inspired and feeling a sense of connection. 
For the next few years, Smith aims to expand his company and wants to gather, promote and manage artists. He said he cannot imagine his life without music and that is what makes him feel whole and happy. 
“I believe that I could be the CEO, the lead marketer of ESO and people are going to look at me and they’re going to think about my music,” Smith said. “They’re going to think about the great positive messages that go along with my music.” 
Smith continues to make individual tracks, while he is currently helping other ESO artists grow and create their own albums. For the next few months Smith is taking more of a leadership role as he is working on the production side of his company. 
“I’m still making beats,” Smith said. “I’m writing verses daily. But those releases may not be in the form of an album, at least right now, just because we have other albums and projects coming up. But they will almost certainly be in the form of like individual release tracks or like singles that I plan.”
