Since its 2004 founding, G.O.O.D. Music has been considered one of the industry’s most top labels, and its highly anticipated compilation album Cruel Summer, released Tuesday, did not disappoint. Ringleader Kanye West and his fellow rap and hip-hop impresarios have put together a quality album in a time when no other labels are showing this type of team connectivity.
As with much of West’s work, the album strikes a nice balance between mainstream radio hits and quality production for the tougher to impress. You can feel West’s presence on the beats that follow unorthodox drums and samples. Notable production also comes from Hit-Boy, Young Chop, and Travis Scott.
Cruel Summer features 5 singles, three of which reached top 10 positions on the Billboard Hot 100.  “I Don’t Like,” “Mercy” and “Clique” have all been receiving plenty of radio playtime, and are steadily creeping up the iTunes charts.
The success is hardly a surprise, especially considering the talent assembled. West recruited two label mates, 2 Chainz and Big Sean for “I Don’t Like”, as well as hip hop legend Jadakiss.  “Mercy,” perhaps the most popular radio hit from the album, again features 2 Chainz and Big Sean, as well as G.O.O.D. Music’s Pusha T.  “Clique,” the last released single and a number one hit on iTunes, gets a boost from West mentor Jay-Z.
Those who complain about the album’s shallow lyrics will still appreciate the top notch production and talent assembled here. And the tenants of collaboration and camaraderie that populate the world of G.O.O.D. surely compensate. From West’s genius artistic visions to Common and Big Sean’s lyricism to the grimier street styles of 2 Chainz and Pusha T, Cruel Summer is able to create a variety of songs that encompass a vast world of hip-hop.
Still — and this is no real surprise — West is the centerpiece, the man off whom all others play. He sets a thematic tone for the album as he likens himself to “the God of Rap” on “To The World,” or claims that, “G.O.O.D. would have been G.O.D. but I added more O’s,” as he does on “The One.” The other artists try to keep up, bragging about how rich and powerful they are.
But as always, Kanye adds some humor to the album, like when he raps about his girlfriend Kim Kardashian on the songs “Cold” and “Clique.” “Cold,” released before “Kimye” became a thing, expresses a particular distaste and jealously for Kris Humphries.
“And I’ll admit I fell in love with Kim / Around the same time she had fell in love with him / Well that’s cool baby girl do your thing / Lucky I ain’t have Jay drop him from the team,” Kanye says.
In “Clique,” Kim’s sex-tape is fair game — “my girl a superstar all from a home movie” — a display of braggadocio so heavy and free of judgement it can only be entertaining and appreciated.
Again, though, the true strength of the album lies in the production. On multiple songs, the beat changes two, three, sometimes even four times. This alone shows the progression of G.O.O.D. over the last few years. And these intricacies make up for what is lost in deep, meaningful lyricism.
On beats alone, the label claims its spot among hip hop’s best.

As the USC women’s soccer team opens up Pac-12 play this weekend against Washington, it’ll do so with a discomforting distinction involving defense.
High scorer · Junior forward/midfielder Elizabeth Eddy led USC in scoring in 2011, but she has primarily played on the back line this season. – Daily Trojan file photo
USC (3-4-1) is the only team in the Pac-12 not to have shut out an opponent yet this season, having allowed 2.12 goals per game so far  — the worst in the conference by a wide margin. The second worst defensive squad, Washington State, has allowed 1.14 goals per game.
“We just need to stop giving goals away,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “If we’re lackadaisical defensively and give the ball away, and [opposing] teams are good, they punish you for those types of errors.”
Fortunately for the Women of Troy, they will likely have two veteran defenders returning from injuries in senior Kristina Noriega (concussion) and redshirt sophomore Mia Bruno (quad strain)  just as conference play begins.
Khosroshahin pointed out that the two would be game-time decisions, and also said that he’s “very, very hopeful” that the pair will be able to play against the Huskies (7-1-1).
Freshmen Marlee Carrillo and Erin Owen, who are both taller than 6 feet, have taken most of the starts at the center back positions for the Women of Troy thus far. Junior Elizabeth Eddy, who led USC in scoring last year as a midfielder/forward, has mostly played on the back line this season.
“We’re going to have to make some changes in the back,” Khosroshahin said. “The way we’re leaking goals right now, I want some experience back there [on defense].”
Things have been looking brighter on the other side of the pitch, as the Women of Troy haven’t been shut out yet this year, either.
Junior midfielder Jordan Marada, senior midfielder Samantha Johnson and freshman forward Katie Johnson each have three goals to lead USC in scoring, and Marada tops the squad with four assists.
Eddy credits the success on offense to the team’s focus on possessing the ball in their opponent’s defensive third of the field.
“We can shoot from outside as well as work it inside,” Eddy said. “We throw a ton of numbers up top and when we’ve got great attacking center midfielders like [Marada], it’s really good for us.”
USC is second in the Pac-12 with 19.6 shots per game, but is tied for fifth in goals per game.
“Our possession has improved tremendously,” Khosroshahin said. “We just need to improve the quality of our opportunities.”
The Women of Troy might be hard-pressed to do that against the Huskies, who have averaged only 0.44 goals allowed per game.
Washington goalkeeper Kari Davidson leads the Pac-12 with 5.25 saves per game, helping the Huskies record five shutouts in nine games.
“They’re really athletic,” Marada said. “They’ll run at you, so we need to show them what we got and come out as the better team.”
Junior midfielder Lindsey Elston acts as the offensive hub for Washington, leading the Huskies with six goals and four assists, which ties her for the Pac-12 lead with 16 points.
“They’re a good side — they’re very disciplined, they’re very hardworking,” Khosroshahin said. “It’ll be a real tough match, but we like our chances.”
Despite USC’s defensive struggles and the Huskies’ prowess on both sides of the ball, the Women of Troy have some advantages.
Washington won its first seven games of the season, but tied Utah State 1-1 and lost to BYU 3-1 in its last two matches.
And last season, the Women of Troy didn’t record a shutout through their first 14 games —and ended that streak against Washington in a 1-0 road win.
The Women of Troy have defended their home turf against the Huskies, who haven’t won at USC since 2001.
USC will try to keep that streak going Friday at 2 p.m. at McAlister Field. The game will be shown on the Pac-12 Network.

After an impressive showing in the NorCal Invitational, the USC men’s water polo team returns home this weekend to face California in the Trojans’ first game in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play. The Golden Bears, who also participated in the NorCal Invitational, are coming off two tough losses to UCLA and Stanford.

“Any time we play Cal it’s an exciting game,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We just know that all these games will come down to one or two plays, so we cannot relax.”
The main challenge the team faces against Cal is its attacking duo of Collin Smith and Aleksa Saponjic. In nine games this season, Smith, a junior, has already scored 29 goals. Saponjic, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics with Serbia, scored 30 goals as a freshman last season.
“We need to be aware of where those guys are,” Vavic said. “They create so many opportunities, so our whole team needs to be aware. They are their biggest weapons.”
Smith and Saponjic lead a Golden Bears attack that is the most dangerous in fast-break situations. With speed on the outside, they are capable of scoring goals in bunches, which is something the entire USC defense is focused on stopping.
“Our challenge is going to be stopping them in the counter attack and making sure we anticipate early and get back on defense,” senior two-meter Matt Burton said. “They have some guys with blinding speed, so that’s going to be our main focus.”
In last season’s only meeting between the two teams, USC won 9-8 in sudden death overtime at Berkeley, a key victory that contributed greatly to the team’s postseason success and dashed Cal’s hopes at unseating the Trojans. Coming into this game, the team is fully aware that the Golden Bears are hungry to return the favor.
“I’m sure that they are going to come in with a chip on their shoulder, given the intensity of last year’s game,” Burton said. “We’ll be prepared for this game. We always are.”
Given how well the team played this past weekend, though, coach Vavic is very confident in his team’s ability to slow down the Bears’ attack.
“We have done a good job at stopping our opponent when we needed to get a stop,” Vavic said. “Our half court defense and 5-on-6 defense have been pretty consistent.”
USC’s two goalies, sophomore Ely Bonilla and junior James Clark, have played extremely well thus far, allowing an average of 4.25 goals per game between the two of them. Clark, in his first year with the program, knows full well the challenge that Cal presents in such a  young season.
“They play a physical game that will be tough to overcome,” Clark said. “It won’t be easy this weekend.”
Sunday’s game begins at 1 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. It will also be televised on ESPNU.

Amid the third season since former USC coach Pete Carroll left the Trojans in the lurch, it’s clear the current Seattle Seahawks coach has left an impression on USC in 2012.
USC still benefits from Carroll’s cultivation of the brazen, rock-star culture recruits find so attractive, and the Kiffin regime often echoes Carroll’s “Always Compete” mantra.
But what often goes unnoticed about Carroll is a shortcoming that Kiffin is still scrambling to overcome: Carroll neglected to recruit enough offensive linemen in his later years with the Trojans.
I could provide a statistical breakdown of last Saturday’s offensive debacle against Stanford, or recount the offensive line’s various missteps, but we all know the line’s performance was simply atrocious; there’s no way to sugarcoat it.
Casual fans usually aren’t trained to detect superior or subpar blocking, mostly because there’s too much activity occurring. Besides, we prefer to watch the dazzling playmakers on the outside.
Indeed, the anonymity of playing offensive line is a double-edged sword. Unless you’re a standout like former left tackle Matt Kalil, you’re unlikely to get noticed, whether you’re executing well or playing terribly.
That’s what was so appalling about the offensive line’s play against the Cardinal: We quickly noticed how bad it was.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley was driven into the ground after hand-offs on run plays — something that’s wholly unacceptable. The offensive line made Stanford inside linebacker Shayne Skov, who was playing in just his fifth game in two years after undergoing knee surgery in 2011 and serving a one-game suspension to open 2012 after a drunk driving arrest, look like a turbo-charged Ray Lewis.
So, how did we get here?
From 2006-10, Carroll’s recruiting classes signed a mere 13 offensive line recruits. The number is practically 12, however, as 2010 five-star offensive tackle prospect Seantrel Henderson asked to be released from his scholarship upon learning of USC’s sanctions in June 2010. Though 2010 was ostensibly Kiffin’s first class, I consider it Carroll’s final class because Kiffin took over a month before 2010 National Signing Day and the class was already largely in place.
On average, USC doled out around 20 scholarships per year from 2006-10; generally, two went to offensive linemen.
That’s not to say Carroll didn’t recruit impact players up front. In 2008, he signed a banner class of future first round picks Tyron Smith and Kalil, as well as senior center Khaled Holmes. In 2009, he signed current starters John Martinez and Kevin Graf.
But there were also some clear misses: 2008 recruits Daniel Campbell and Matt Meyer never provided depth to the unit, as Campbell was never cleared academically and Meyer retired after his freshman year because of recurring foot injuries.
Sophomore guard Giovanni Di Paolo — USC’s only other offensive lineman recruit in 2010 besides Henderson — has battled injuries and is not listed on the two-deep depth chart.
The issue is that Carroll took relatively fewer offensive linemen than his competitors, thus creating serious depth issues.
For comparison’s sake, from 2006-10, LSU and Alabama both signed 20 offensive linemen apiece — seven more than USC. The bruising Cardinal has remade its image mostly with dominating offensive linemen classes, bringing in 17 during that five year span.
The impact of allotting relatively fewer scholarships for offensive linemen was best exemplified in USC’s early depth chart.
Against Hawai’i, USC’s backups for the starting offensive line were, from left to right, true freshman Max Tuerk, former walk-on Abe Markowitz, who has only three career games under his belt, redshirt freshman Cyrus Hobbi, junior college transfer Jeremy Galten, who lost the competition in 2011 for the starting left guard spot to then-freshman Marcus Martin and walk-on Nathan Guertler.
Now, this isn’t to undermine any of these players. In fact, Tuerk is vying with sophomore offensive tackle Aundrey Walker in practice this week for the starting assignment against California Saturday, and Hobbi is likely Holmes’ ultimate replacement next year. But, at the moment, these backups don’t inspire much confidence as replacements in the case that any starters suffer long-term injuries.
Moreover, they don’t really cause the starters to look over their shoulders and fret about losing their jobs. It’s natural to question whether a sense of complacency has seeped into this current starting group. Just this week, Kiffin notably singled out Walker’s lack of effort against Stanford as problematic.
Positions on the offensive line are notoriously difficult to learn, which is why analysts often consider fielding young linemen a weakness. Kiffin, unlike Carroll, understands the importance of bringing in an influx of offensive linemen each year, so USC can constantly groom experienced replacements.
In his first two recruiting cycles, Kiffin brought in eight offensive line recruits — even though he was hampered by NCAA sanctions that limited his available scholarships.
It will take a season or two to benefit from these signings, but Kiffin’s long-term vision will ensure fewer future offensive line performances like the ones against Stanford last weekend and Arizona State in 2011.
Though the lights shine brightest on the skilled positions, without the gritty, thankless work in the trenches, their efforts are all for naught.

A season ago, USC’s defensive unit lined up opposite Zach Maynard and intercepted the California quarterback three times.
Completing less than 58 percent of his passes, Maynard was chased, hurried and rattled by the Trojans’ front seven. In total, they forced five turnovers against the Golden Bears en route to a 30-9 win at AT&T Park in San Francisco.

Fast forward 11 months later and the Trojans insist they’re facing a different Maynard — a Maynard who is more polished, more collected, and, perhaps most importantly, more careful.
Cal (1-2) travels south to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday to face No. 13 USC (2-1, 0-1) in the 100th meeting between the two schools.
“[Maynard’s] decision making has improved,” said sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, who intercepted the signal caller twice during last season’s meeting. “He’s a little more accurate than he was last year. We expect him to bring his ‘A’ game.”
In Maynard’s last outing, a seven-point loss at No. 16 Ohio State, the left-handed senior completed 26 of 37 passes, with just one interception. Through three games this season, his completion percentage stands at 67 percent — a far cry from the 57 percent mark in 2011.
“He’s really grown,” said Cal coach Jeff Tedford during the weekly Pac-12 conference call Tuesday. “Last year, early in the year, he struggled just managing the game and turning the ball over and the speed of the game.”
Maynard’s improvement, as Tedford points out, started in the month of November. Cal finished with a 3-1 mark in the month, and Maynard posted a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 5:1 while passing for 736 yards, taking the leap many had expected.
And that — at least thus far — has carried over to 2012. Part of that is talent, as Cal boasts a returning 1,000-yard rusher in senior Isi Sofele and 1,000-yard receiver in junior Keenan Allen. But Maynard has also matured.
“He’s just grown each week and is comfortable with the offense, the speed of the game and protecting the football,” Tedford said.
Tedford’s counterpart, USC coach Lane Kiffin, hasn’t hesitated from offering a similar assessment.
“[Maynard] played his best game I’ve seen on film last Saturday,” Kiffin said. “He played really well in a tough game, on the road, early kickoff, packed house, good defense. You can tell he’s improved.”
In the wake of the Trojans’ first loss of the season, they’re looking for improvement as well.
Against Stanford, the offensive line allowed four sacks, exactly half the number it gave up in 2011, which tied for the fewest in the country.
Since then, Kiffin gave freshman Max Tuerk the chance to compete for the starting left tackle spot against sophomore Aundrey Walker over the course of three days of practice from Tuesday through Thursday. No final decision has been made, though.
“You’re going to make mistakes,” Kiffin said, “but we won’t tolerate a lack of great effort. Not when you put on these jerseys all these great players have worn before.”
Looking for marked improvement, Kiffin and the Trojans are also hoping to see senior center Khaled Holmes, who was sidelined for the team’s Pac-12 opener against the Cardinal, return to the lineup. The 6-foot-4 Rimington Award candidate as the nation’s top center sustained a leg injury during the Trojans’ Sept. 8 game against Syracuse in East Rutherford, N.J. and was carted off the field. Neither specifics nor a timetable for a return are known due to USC’s policy of not disclosing injury information.
Holmes, though, was listed as USC’s starter on the depth chart released Sunday.
Either junior Abe Markowitz or redshirt freshman Cyrus Hobbi will replace Holmesat center should he be unable to play.
As evidenced by their recent performance, USC’s offense would be aided by a healthy offensive line. Against the Cardinal, the unit looked stagnant and was held scoreless over the final 40 minutes. The offense also committed three turnovers, two of them interceptions from senior quarterback Matt Barkley, prompting Kiffin to call them “two of the worst decisions” he has made in a game since the two reunited in 2010.
“Yeah, I made some poor decisions,” Barkley said. “But that’s why you watch film and learn from it.”
And so the Trojans, after dropping more than 10 spots in both the Associated Press and USA Today coaches’ polls and seemingly falling out of the BCS national title race for the time being, will look to learn and avoid a similar letdown against Cal, a team they have had succes against as of late. USC has held Cal to an average of 10 points in their last three meetings.
“They just came out and won,” said sophomore defensive tackle George Uko, referring to last Saturday’s loss to Stanford. “We lost. There’s nothing more than that. We move on from there and keep on going.”
Kickoff on Saturday is scheduled for 3 p.m. and will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.
Tomorrow is going to be a great game; both teams are coming off losses, but I think USC’s offense has too many weapons to get upset two weeks in a row! I’m stoked that DISH got the Pac-12 Networks so I can watch the game tomorrow! I saw that their games were available to me when I was scrolling through my Hopper’s GameFinder app. The transparent overlay on the screen makes it easy for me to set reminders for games without missing out on what’s going on TV. A coworker at DISH told me about this feature and it’ll help me know when USC is on the Pac-12 Networks. I don’t think USC is out of the national championship race just yet. They just have to win the rest of their games to keep the hope alive!

A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge decided Thursday to delay setting a date for the preliminary hearing of two men charged in the killing of two USC graduate students.
Judge Shelly Torrealba postponed the hearing at the request of attorneys, who asked for more time to examine the evidence. They will return to court on Nov. 20 to set the date for the preliminary hearing.
Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, pleaded not guilty in July to charges including the murders of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, graduate engineering students from China, and murder during a botched robbery in the April shootings on Raymond Avenue.
Barnes and Bolden were arrested in May after the Los Angeles Police Department used shell casings found at the scene to connect them to a murder attempt in South Los Angeles in 2011. Detectives from the Federal Buruea of Investigation and Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives assisted LAPD with the investigation.

An increase in technology used by USC’s Dept. of Public Safety has led to more burglars being caught and items recovered from incidents of theft on campus, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle.

Recently, campus dorms and classrooms have been the targets of the theft of electronics. Last week, Anthony Devon Ross, a non-USC student, was arrested for stealing multiple laptops and other electronic devices from Fluor Tower on the northwest side of the University Park Campus. Ross is a familiar face at the dorm and is suspected of conducting a string of burglaries in the dorm dating back to April 2011, Carlisle said.
“[Being] on the perimeter of campus might be an issue [for Fluor],” Carlisle said. “There’s also a lot of foot traffic around Fluor because of the Lyon Center. Plus, we are the most diverse campus in the United States, so it’s easy to blend in as a USC student.”
College campuses are enticing to thieves because of how many electronics students own, Carlisle said.
“Thieves choose college campuses because that’s where the electronics are,” Carlisle said. “You just name it — there’s thousands of laptops, smartphones and iPods everywhere.”
Burglars are not the only ones looking for new electronics on campus, though. DPS is beginning to use technology to its advantage.
Ross was apprehended last year with the help of surveillance cameras unique to Fluor Tower. After DPS identified him on the camera, they distributed crime bulletins with his face around the residential hall. From these surveillance pictures, a Fluor residential advisor was able to recognize his face and identify him from the picture.
DPS has also used newer technology to recover stolen items. After students from a yoga class held in the Physical Education building had their electronic possessions stolen from them earlier this month, DPS used Find My iPhone, a standard tracking device, to locate the smartphones. The tracking device traced the phones to a used phone business in Chinatown where the perpetrators were disassembling them to rebuild and sell them.
Carlisle attributes these recoveries to the increase in technology his department is using and encourages students to utilize it more too.
“It’s definitely making our job more efficient,” Carlisle said. “We have recovered more stolen items because we can use tracking software, but we can’t take advantage of that technology if people who own the electronics don’t install the applications.”
This marks the first year that university students are being offered free tracking software. Frontdoor Software, which can be downloaded to laptops and lasts for four years, is a product to ward off electronics theft on campus. When a laptop is taken, the owner can report it as stolen, and the security software makes the laptop become vocal, alerting others around it that the device has been stolen and is in the hands of the wrong person.
DPS Chief Carey Drayton believes this new software could be an effective product for USC students to use.
“A computer that is protected with something is better than a computer protected with nothing,” Drayton said.
Though more stolen items are being recovered with technological advances, some students are still wary about the security of their electronics on campus. Tracking technology does not work if a thief has powered off a laptop or cell phone.
Anne Kennedy, a freshman majoring in psychology, has firsthand experience with this problem — her laptop was stolen while she was in a yoga class.
“There’s definitely a theft problem on campus,” Kennedy said. “I take my stuff with me everywhere now. I think tracking is just for emotional security, honestly.”
Other students, however, believe that the new technology can prove helpful if every student contributes to solving the theft problem on campus.
“I’ll probably download the Frontdoor Software,” said Julia Loup, a freshman majoring in psychology who had an iPod stolen last month. “But I think it’s a combination of both the tracking technology and other students on campus being smart with looking out for their stuff.”

Students and faculty gathered in Doheny Library for a panel discussion on Arts and Reconstruction after Genocide on Thursday.
The panel was in conjunction with the performance of Africa’s Hope, a dance show performed by the Rwandan theater company Mashirika Creative and Performing Arts Group, which took place Wednesday night. The events were put on as part of the Visions and Voices initiative and co-hosted by the Applied Theatre Arts program in the School of Dramatic Arts and the USC Shoah Foundation Institute.
Members of Mashirika on the panel led the discussion about the effects genocide has had on Rwanda and its art as a process of reconstruction. The acclaimed theater company is composed of 20 artists who were exiled from Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. The actors, dancers and musicians aim to prove that performing arts can be more than just entertainment — they can serve as a tool for social transformation.
Transformation · Angel Kabanguka Uwamahoro (right) tells the audience on Thursday about her experiences performing the emotional material dealing with the Rwandan genocide as Elaine Umuhire looks on. – Alec Faulkner | Daily Trojan
“My entire history has affected the work I do,” said Hope Azeda, artistic director of Mashirika. “There was a need for justice after the war. We cannot just stop at memory. There has to be a will to move on.”
Africa’s Hope tells the story of survival and hope during the Rwandan genocide. Narrated by multiple viewpoints, the performance gives the genocide an eerily artistic voice by representing Rwandans who are either dead or alive. The performers assume their roles entirely, and at parts, describe the horrors of the genocide through first-person monologues.
“[Being a part of the company] has taught me how to really fit into somebody’s skin and step into somebody’s shoes,” said Angel Kabanguka Uwamahoro, an artist in Mashirika. “I actually feel like I’m that person in that role. I actually transform into my role.”
Many of the group’s members, like Azeda, witnessed the genocide firsthand and are able to bring a unique artistic perspective to the performances. Azeda had eight brothers, but after the genocide, only three of her brothers remained at home.
“I was born in exile into a family of 11. I was the 10th born,” she said. “There was a problem in Rwanda, and I needed to respond. I went in [to Makerere University] with the intention of using theater as a subject for social transformation.”
Africa’s Hope set out to bridge the gap between recounting the pain of the genocide and providing a hope to move on.
“To perform as a member of Mashirika,” Elaine Umuhire said, “was my duty, but it was also my healing. If I can smile but can’t feel the pain, there is only one side that’s working, and it’s not the truth.”
Mashirika is hosting a theater workshop on art and transformation Friday where they will share their techniques in play-building and conflict resolution. The free workshop will take place in Massman Theatre at noon and reservations can be made online on the Visions and Voices website.

NASA’s space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to end its 20-year-long career of space exploration when it lands Friday at Los Angeles International Airport. Riding across the country piggyback on a specialized 747 jet, Endeavour is scheduled to fly over the Getty Center, Disneyland and Exposition Park on Friday morning en route to LAX. From there it will be transported to the California Science Center at Exposition Park — just blocks from USC — where students will be able to see it displayed in its permanent home at the museum beginning in October.

Endeavour’s arrival is the talk of aerospace engineering professors at USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering, who welcome this new addition to the California Science Center with high hopes for its reception by students and the greater L.A. community.
“This is a fantastic development for Los Angeles and America in general,” said Mike Gruntman, a professor of astronautics at Viterbi. “If [students] are curious enough, they should go see Endeavour, a unique achievement in American space industry.”
Gruntman is confident that interested students will be able to volunteer or work at the Science Center as docents for the exhibit.
Gruntman and his colleague, aerospace and mechanical engineering Professor Steven Nutt, encouraged students of all majors to visit the space shuttle on display after the Oct. 30 opening of the Samuel Oschin Space Shuttle Display Pavilion exhibit, a project 20 years in the making.
“The curator and concept design team, along with our president, Jeffrey Rudolph, were putting together a plan for the museum back in 1992,” said spokeswoman Shell Amega at the Science Center. “In that plan they had envisioned one day displaying a flown space shuttle in the launch position. Just by coincidence, 1992 was the year Endeavour launched on its first mission.”
The $2 billion Endeavour was originally built to replace the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle, which crashed and killed seven astronauts in 1986. Since then, Endeavour has completed 25 missions, ranging from repairing the Hubble Telescope in 1993 to building the $100 billion International Space Station orbiting 250 miles above Earth. The shuttle is unique from other NASA shuttles in that it is reusable and all of its missions were manned.
“It’s a hybrid vehicle that takes off like a rocket but lands like an airplane,” Nutt said.
Students are also excited about the arrival of a space shuttle so close to campus.
“It’s one of the few things that have been in space that won’t be in a thousand pieces when it comes back,” said Trey Sorrells, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering. “It’s incredible. A man has actually been inside — in space.”
Amega suggests students purchase timed tickets for the exhibit for $3 on the Science Center website in order to reserve a spot for Endeavour’s first weeks. During opening week, the museum will host “Space Fest” in conjunction with NASA, a collaboration that will feature booths and demonstrations about space exploration. The exhibit, which will display the shuttle in a pavilion on the west side of the Science Center, will also feature artifacts from Endeavour’s mission control and interactive videos.
“You won’t be able to go in the shuttle because it is so fragile, but it will feel like it because we pull out components from the shuttle like the kitchen and potty,” Amega said. “You will see a hilarious video of the astronauts showing visitors how to go to the bathroom in space. You’ll also get to touch the tires and see an up-close-and-personal view of the space tiles from below the shuttle.”
Though Endeavour certainly will add to the Science Center’s prominence once the shuttle arrives, transporting it from Florida to LAX to the Science Center creates a few logistical problems. Its 12-mile journey from storage to the Science Center on Oct. 13 will bring the shuttle very near to USC and threatens to worsen traffic congestion near campus.
“Final plans in conjunction with the LAPD and the L.A. Department of Transportation will be finalized in the next week or so,” said Tony Mazza, director of USC’s Department of Transportation, which is working to make transportation and security preparations for the day of Endeavour’s arrival.
“We will be fully staffed on that day, and Endeavour’s route will be on the opposite side of the Coliseum, coming in on Martin Luther King Boulevard and making a left on Robertson, so it really shouldn’t affect students that much,” Mazza said.
Weighing 170,000 pounds, measuring five stories high and sporting a 78-foot wingspan, Endeavour will make its way to the museum on a self-propelled mobile transport system with wheels that can rotate 360 degrees.
“It is one of the largest things to ever roll down an urban street,” Amega said. “But because of intense coordinated planning with city-wide agencies, there will be no power outages and limited closures — the freeway will open to traffic after Endeavour rolls past.”
Endeavour’s arrival close to campus also poses an environmental threat — clearing the shuttle’s path from LAX and the construction of a new pavilion to house the shuttle at the Science Center requires more than 400 trees to be cut down.
Though this has sparked controversy among residents and environmentalists, the Science Center has pledged to compensate for it by replanting four times as many trees and putting more money toward tree maintenance.
“We are very excited that this exhibit will provide inspiration for the next generation of innovators and explorers, because there’s nothing like seeing an amazing national treasure like the Endeavour,” Amega said. “If you think about it, it’s kind of like a superstar — it’s out of this world.”
When does the shuttle go I’ve Hawthorne / lax ?
And another issue: “The shuttle is unique from other NASA shuttles in that it is reusable and all of its missions were manned.”  There are no other shuttles that are not re-usable.  Prior to the shuttles NASA used one-time use capsules, but they were never considered shuttles.
It’s not blocks…its literally across the street!

Though the Oscars have always been the most buzzed-about event of awards season — and likely will be for the foreseeable future — they might no longer be the most important. Long thought to be out of touch and subject to the whims of Academy politics, the ceremony’s self-righteous sanctimony and lack of any real entertainment value would be only half tolerable even if Hollywood itself weren’t growing more stagnant each year.
This Oscar fatigue combined with the unprecedented quality of the Golden Age of television leaves the field open for the second most respected accolade in entertainment to gain some real ground in the public consciousness. It’s too bad, then, that the Emmys might be more egregious than their big screen cousin in the way they completely and arbitrarily ignore some of the most deserving candidates, instead latching onto certain performances or programs year after year.
Progress, though, is not out of the question, as reflected by this year’s largely accurate slate of drama nominees. And though the comedy side of things still leaves much to be desired, the Emmy ceremony itself, thankfully enough, is usually more than watchable. And no matter the quality of an awards show, predicting and then arguing over the outcome remains a guilty pleasure.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with retelling an old story.
Shakespeare did it all the time — even in famous plays like Hamlet and King Lear — and he rarely gets dismissed for a lack of originality. Sure, it might be tempting to call the Bard an exception to the rule, but the truth is that remakes are an essential part of our culture. Never doubt that wherever media is produced, it will soon be reproduced.
If it seems like Hollywood is especially egregious in this regard, it helps to remember exactly how far back the practice goes. How long was it, one might wonder, before remakes of early films hit theaters? The answer, it turns out, is pretty much immediately.
The first motion picture to actually tell a coherent story was The Great Train Robbery (1903), and it only took a year for another version to get pumped out. So though it’s tempting to condemn Hollywood for their tendency to remake old masterpieces, the practice is hardly new or unusual.
That’s not to say, however, the current industry’s attitude toward remaking intellectual properties doesn’t need some serious re-evaluation. Though remakes are not despicable in and of themselves, there’s no denying that the way the studios are handling them right now is frustrating at best and mind-numbingly inane at worst. And the issue isn’t that most of these projects are critical failures — although when they are it comes as no surprise. There are, after all, entertaining and even well-made remakes(21 Jump Street comes to mind). No, the concern is the nearly unprecedented quantity of reused and recycled material getting churned out by the studio machine.
In the past few years, big ’80s flicks like Clash of the Titans, The Thing, The Karate Kid, Footloose, Conan the Barbarian and A Nightmare on Elm Street have been repackaged for the silver screen. And that’s not even counting the involvement of television, with ’80s shows like The A-Team getting modern movie adaptations, or the ridiculous Michael J. Fox film Teen Wolf moving to MTV.
Then there’s toy company Hasbro partnering with Paramount to try and make franchises out of all their old playthings, with movies based on GI Joe, the board game Battleship and the notoriously awful yet hugely successful Transformers series from Michael Bay.
So why are all these ’80s properties coming to theaters now?
The phenomenon traces back to the blockbuster market. Major studios no longer produce smaller films for a few million dollars apiece. Every picture now seemingly revolves around high profits during its opening weekend at the box office.
Very few executives, then, are willing to back new ideas, because there’s no surefire way to predict what will draw audiences. If they choose to remake an old movie, there are two perceived advantages. First, the film has a greater chance to be successful because of an already existing fanbase. And, second, if the film isn’t successful, the filmmakers can try to dodge some of the blame by pointing out that the same idea worked before. The ’80s  in particular are getting plundered to such an extent simply because Hollywood’s modern decision makers were consuming that media during their formative years.
Far from abating, it looks like the trend is only going to increase for the foreseeable future. Remakes of Robocop, The Evil Dead, Carrie, Mad Max and plenty more are in the works.
Still, these movies don’t reflect the most baffling projects still to come.
Until very recently, a long-delayed update on Red Dawn might have been the biggest offender when it came to clearly unnecessary remakes. The original concerns a group of high school students fighting off an invading force of Russians, a concept so clearly rooted in Cold War paranoia that no one outside of its time of release could even begin to take it seriously. (The new version has North Koreans in place of the Soviets.)
Then came the news that Sony is planning a film based on the television series Manimal, which revolves around a doctor who turns into various animals in order to fight crime. Critics and audiences both rejected it, and the series was cancelled after eight episodes. Now it’s only remembered as a joke, but because that technically counts as being remembered, apparently it merits a cinematic reboot.
Here we have the behavior of the current entertainment industry at its zenith: Whether the property had a fan following or not no longer matters — the very fact that it existed is enough to justify bringing it back, instead of pursuing an original idea.
If there’s a line in the sand, this is it. Remakes are always going to happen. Sometimes, they’re even worth getting excited about. But if audiences don’t have a legitimate interest in something, don’t bring it back over a more deserving, original idea out of fear that something genuinely new might not succeed.

In the lobby of Doheny Memorial Library stands the one and only Mosely Snowflake Sponge, the world’s first three-dimensional origami representation of the icy fractal. Hand-built from nearly 50,000 cardinal-and-gold folded business cards, this exhibit, best described as a fusion of interdisciplinary elements, opened Thursday. The structure will officially be making its home at Doheny through this December.
Communal art · Made up of nearly 50,000 business cards, the structure reflects the collaborative efforts of the USC community. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The snowflake exhibit, modeled after a fractal structure recently discovered by Jeannine Mosely, is the six-month-long labor of love for curator and USC Libraries Discovery fellow Margaret Wertheim.
“The idea of this project was to [create] something that was an intersection of mathematics, art and engineering,” Wertheim said. “What I think people should get is that art can be combined with mathematics. We often think, in our society, that the arts and sciences are very separate, but here’s an artistic project that is also a mathematical project.”
And as it turns out, fractals are the perfect combination of such elements. As Wertheim pointed out, they are found “in the way lightning forks or the way earthquakes strike through rock, the shape of coastline, cauliflower, clouds, the branching structure of trees, veins.” Bearing a self-similarity property, fractals, like the Mosely Snowflake Sponge, exist in non-whole-number dimensions — a fact that surprised many disbelieving mathematicians before the early 20th century, according to Wertheim.
Spanning six months, from February to August, the project first took root in an exchange between Wertheim and the USC Libraries, which expressed interest in developing a work that would combine seemingly disparate fields of study. Collaboration with Wertheim followed, inspiring a project with Mosely, the artist who dreamed up and designed the entire exhibit.
Of the initial decision to begin the project, Wertheim remarked, “[USC Libraries] were very bold, daring and brave, because [the project] turned out to be more complicated [than] any of us ever imagined when we first started. We didn’t quite realize when it began, how much work it would be or what a complicated object this thing was. We have all really had a journey of discovery.”
Yet the exhibit encompasses more than a partnership between just Wertheim, Mosely and the libraries. It is the work of art showcasing the combined efforts of a community — more than 300 USC students and faculty, neighborhood K-12 students and other volunteers.
“When you have that many cards, I don’t see how anyone can do it on their own,” Wertheim said.
At origami workshops across campus set up in the first few months, students from all fields of study learned the art.
Junior psychology major Leah Singerman and sophomore neuroscience major Maurae Baker were among the many contributors. As workers at Doheny for the past summer, Baker and Singerman spent free time folding thousands of business cards, constructing cubes and building modules while simultaneously lighting newfound passion for the art of origami.
“It’s so interesting and almost shocking how you don’t realize what you can do just by folding business cards,” Singerman said. “We would work on it in the lobby during the day, and anyone who was walking through the library would stop and ask, ‘What is this?’ …  Just from doing that, we got so many different types of people involved — from little kids folding the cards to mathematically advanced people making modules all by themselves.”
Baker brought her origami interest beyond library walls.
“I took my dad’s business cards and started doing the same thing, and he was like, ‘This is awesome!’” she said. “So I built him a mini-model. It was cool because we didn’t use any glue; it was just with paper.”
Nearby K-12 students poured in time as well. Through USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative, geometry teacher Mr. Michael Laska of James A. Foshay Academy brought over two large groups of nearly 100 ninth graders, giving them an opportunity to see their textbooks’ three-dimensional figures on a grander scale.
“We were studying three-dimensional geometry, and this just happened to be perfect timing,” said Laska. “It allowed them a lot more freedom than being restricted to just coming up with something everybody makes in class … I think most kids didn’t even know what origami was before this project, this got them really interested.”
This exhibit has been viewed as a community art project and an expression of origami. It has also been seen as an object of mathematics as well as a fusion of the art, math and engineering.
But, there’s one more facet left, mirrored in the cardinal-and-gold pattern of the 50,000-business-card cubes and captured in the words of Baker.
“The exhibit is a celebration of USC and all that it has to offer,” she said. “I can’t wait to see the reactions of everyone who hasn’t seen it yet.”

Though President Barack Obama has ended one war in the Middle East and is currently working to end another, progress remains difficult to define and achieve. But Obama’s foreign policy approach — reducing military spending, moving on from more than a decade of war, focusing on East Asia — is what will be most beneficial for the country.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
It is impossible to talk about the future of U.S. foreign policy without talking about the Middle East. In the last decade, the United States’ involvement in the Middle East has generally revolved around two things: Israel and oil. Former President George W. Bush handled these two issues by supporting Israel with a blank check and invading a country that did not possess nuclear weapons.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney calls for a return to Bush’s policies, which would further vilify the country’s international image and precipitate dramatic increases in military spending for years.
With recent events, such as the assassination of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and murder of three other Americans, such foreign policy is unacceptable for the future of America. The attack on the Middle East embassy last week was not a means to an end  — it is a symptom of an endemic foreign policy problem. The next president cannot continue the policies that have contributed to a negative image of the United States in the Middle East.
The clash between the Middle East and Western powers has deep historical roots. The mess of policies the United States has employed to prevent violence in the Middle East has not worked because it has largely assumed a militaristic role. Admittedly, Obama has not entirely changed that. During his time as president, he ordered a record number of drone strikes, targeting Taliban soldiers along with al-Qaeda leaders.
Though, while taking such action is more aggressive than Bush was in many respects when it comes to fighting in the Middle East, he is not as hawkish. Right now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the United States to join Israel in an attack on Iran. While Obama does not want Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, his administration is committed to avoiding more war.
Romney does not share this view. More war means more lives lost and more money wasted on military spending rather than bolstering our sagging economy.
When it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Obama favors a two-state solution that allows Palestinians to have their own country and their own dignity. Romney was filmed in the video released by Mother Jones this week saying that Palestinians have no interest in peace. As he sees it, “…we have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.” Is that how the president elect should approach a conflict as serious as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? What does that say about his approach to foreign policy?
While America’s involvement in the Middle East has never been ideal, Obama’s policies uphold a belief that, eventually, conflict can be minimized and some version of peace can be achieved.
We are either at the dusk or dawn of the Arab Spring — the first year of a trend to last for centuries or to watch a modern-day revolution fold in on itself. But one thing is for certain: This shift creates a gap that might slowly allow America to break with an image as an Israel-loving, Islamophobic imperialist power.
The nation’s foreign policy during the next four years will leave a historic, powerful effect on the political landscape of the Middle East. One presidential candidate plans for a return to failed policies, whereas the other will make carefully measured moves to decrease our country’s military presence — a presence that has brought about hatred and violence.
The conflicts in the Middle East might seem far away, but who we vote into office come Nov. 6 will have a decisive impact on either making the conflict a much larger part of our lives, or moving forward toward a better future.

“Kick” As a country we have spent decades and billions of dollars mediating between Israel and Various Leaders of Palestine. Well the leaders and their friends are now rich and the conflict is unresolved. Perhaps it would be best to pull the plug on our foreign aid to see if it is our dollars standing in the way of peace.
“with direct failure to Israel”
Who cares? We’re about America..
WHy the hell was my post deleted?? freaking commies..
First of all Obama has not ended anything.  Iraq is still under occupation, the war in Afganistan has expended into Pakistan.  The “peacemaker” winner has invaded and bombed Libya back to the stone age and killed between 50,000 to 100,000.. Allegedly in the name of a humanatarain intervention(clever propaganda)..
He is helping terrorists murder inside Syria..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkrTQRg571w&list=PLe0dl1g37cZzlDB3xTcfsrPmVlTf9q4hp&index=73&feature=plpp_video
Romney and Obama = same BS
and who cares about Israel.. WTF is that about rafael? We’re Americans.. Nothing would change for worse is America if israel and/or Palestine ceased to exist tomorrow.
FYI:
Iraq had the “yellowcake” (urania) which was removed from that country. Since that mission is complete it can be known. Current U.S. President policy on Middle-East is a failure, with direct failure to Israel. As for deduction of military spending that is also a failure, since Russia and China are increasing their military upgrades and expansion. The Middle-East is a time-bomb and only solid, strong and wise leadership is necessary and critical for the U.S. which current administration does not have. Look to the wisdom and strength of Mount Rushmore’s honorary Presidents

In light of last week’s assassination of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and the murder of three other Americans, coupled with the spread of anti-American sentiment and attacks across the Middle East, foreign policy has begun to overshadow economic policy in the 2012 presidential election.
The Middle East embassy attacks also highlight a serious need for American foreign policy to change directions.
The 21st century cannot be defined by a decline of U.S. global influence and increase of foreign policy inconsistency. Foreign policy must be reimagined to allow for the re-emergence of a stronger America. To accomplish this, the nation cannot continue along the path set by the Obama administration. The next president of the United States must take foreign policy in a new, consistent direction to firmly place America in its rightful position as a world leader.
In a speech last October at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney asserted that this century must be defined as the “American Century.”
“America must lead the world, or someone else will,” Romney said. “Without American leadership, without clarity of American purpose and resolve, the world becomes a far more dangerous place, and liberty and prosperity would surely be among the first casualties.”
After President Barack Obama assumed office in 2009, one of his first major foreign policy speeches was in Cairo, Egypt, during which he pledged to resolve conflicts between Muslims and the United States. More than three years later, it is apparent that Obama has failed to mend relationships with the Middle East and tension in the region has escalated to new fatal levels.
The next president needs to implement a new foreign policy in the Middle East that offers room for compromise but asserts the U.S. objectives in the region. This approach was emphasized by former President Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign as “Peace Through Strength.”
But the United States, especially during the Arab Spring, has shown grave inconsistencies in foreign policy. The Obama administration has been stagnant in its reaction to uprisings in the Middle East and intervening during situations in which U.S. interests are at serious risk.
For example, the Obama administration provided aerial support in Libya and utilized extreme diplomatic pressure in Egypt, but it has taken no effective steps to end the violence in Syria, which has claimed the lives of nearly 25,000 Syrians.
Inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy, especially in the Middle East, demonstrate the current administration’s weaknesses and provide opportunities for extremists to capitalize on these shortcomings. This consequently leads to the anti-American sentiment currently growing and spreading across the world. We do not need more of the same. We need to go in a new direction that will break with a past image and shape a new, different and better future.
Within his first 100 days in office, Romney has promised to accomplish eight foreign policy actions, from beginning discussions with Israel about increasing military “coordination and assistance” to conducting an internal review of the War in Afghanistan to determine what the nation’s best next step is.
Romney also plans to assign an official to oversee all U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, a position that does not currently exist in the U.S. State Department. This addition of this position will create continuity in U.S. foreign policy abroad and help to eliminate vulnerability to attacks.
The United States cannot afford to take a passive approach to foreign policy. The next president needs to actively re-strengthen U.S. foreign policy so that this country remains the dominant player in the world’s political and economic spheres, so that this century becomes indisputably the American Century.

After the last presidential election, one would think that Republicans, Democrats, Independents—you name it—would have come to value the younger voting demographic a little more,  particularly college students. One would think.
Many politicians have passed up the opportunity to pander to youth, but few have outright insulted this group of potential voters. As it  happens, Rick Santorum is one such rare politician.
During the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C.  last weekend, Santorum told a crowd, “We will never have the elite, smart people on our side, because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do. So our colleges and universities, they’re not going to be on our side.”
Not only does Santorum sarcastically imply that since smart people are nosy and invasive they won’t vote Republican (ironic, considering it’s the GOP who wants to regulate people’s right to marry and women’s bodies), but that those in universities are the same way: slaves to a system of control.
But it is the very “institutions” of church and family that Santorum goes on to praise in his speech that have historically relished “the power to tell you what to do.” The doctrines, rituals, commandments, and hierarchy of these units tell you what to eat, how to dress, who to talk to, and how to have sex—and that’s just for starters.
The comment about colleges is simultaneously a backhanded slap to and dismissal of student voters, especially Republican college voters. With polls consistently showing that college students are more liberal than ever, this is a dangerous move.
Ironically, Santorum holds a BA, MBA and JD, which undoubtedly contributed to his rise in politics in the first place. Yet, now he parades about as if his higher education never happened, characterizing every youth who dares to go to college as “elitist” and on the wrong side.
If Santorum was intentionally trying to alienate conservative college students, he very well may have accomplished his goal. If not, he has at least lost the GOP a few votes that will be very hard to get back.

Nearly three years after announcing a short hiatus, The Killers are back with their fourth full-length studio album, Battle Born.
In January 2010, just after the close of their world tour supporting 2008’s Day & Age, the band announced that they would be taking a break. The various members spent time working on solo albums and side projects, and in May 2011 they entered the studio to begin work on Battle Born.
The album was released Tuesday, riding the strength of its first single, “Runaways,” which was released July 17 and peaked as high as No. 7 on the Billboard’s U.S. Alternative Songs chart.
Critical reception has been generally favorable so far, with the album attaining an aggregate score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic. Jon Dolan calls Battle Born the band’s “wildest neon-Springsteen fever dream yet” in his three-of-five star review for Rolling Stone.
For the most part, the latest effort from Brandon Flowers and co. sounds a lot like what you’re used to hearing from the group of alternative rockers: towering anthems, sweeping ballads and enough Springsteen callbacks to make anyone start feeling nostalgic. Where most critics seem to agree the album falls short is in toeing the fine line between genuine grandiosity and cheap, overblown rock.
As Chris Bosman writes in his two-of-five star review for Consequence of Sound, “The tragedy of Battle Born is that even when it shouts at the top of its lungs, it never reaches that special place that the band accidentally trips into with their best material.”

One hundred is big, and we’re not just talking Sesame Street, for-the-sake-of-numbers big.
One hundred years ago, on the way to and from class, faculty, staff and students snatched up a version of this newspaper to stay plugged into current events and campus news. One hundred years ago, students picked up the same ink-stained paper to get the latest in collegiate sports. One hundred years ago, students sat down on campus benches and inside classrooms and flipped through pages of the paper the same way some of you do now (if you’re not on your smartphones or laptops). The only difference is that one century ago the Daily Trojan was brand-new at USC.
Originally published as The Daily Southern Californian in 1912, the DT has burgeoned as USC’s long-standing, primary source of campus news and information. It has also been recognized for its enduring mission: to provide a forum for information, for free and responsible discussion, and for intellectual exploration.
Though discussing and exploring USC-centric issues might come across as a vague endeavor, the reality is complex. Impartial coverage of campus is what we strive for every day. Providing campus news involves bringing light to the good, the bad and the ugly of an institution. As a newspaper, we don’t represent USC; we cover USC.
The DT, from one generation of editors to the next, has encouraged reporters to seek the truth and report it. We do our best to achieve that. If something big happens, we let you know. If there’s something out there we think you should know, we tell you about it.
We do this because we’re passionate not just about journalism, but about USC. DT is, after all, an extracurricular activity open to all students — students committed to the goal of informing the USC community.
So how does all this relate?
To celebrate our centennial, we’re doing two big things. The first is done; you’re looking at it. Flip through our supplement to see how the newsroom has evolved, how the writing has continued to change, who has occupied the newsroom and what types of stories have impacted the university and its students’ lives.
The second will be a yearlong process. To commemorate 100 years of student life, breaking news and USC developments, we will be rolling out one article from the DT archives a week during the 2012-13 academic year to signify relevant moments in our university’s (and paper’s) history that either changed or continue to relate to the USC community.
As part of this project, the DT is instituting a digital collection with USC Libraries. Slated for completion in November, DT issues from 1912 to 2012 will be presented online for browsing, researching and reading. You’ll be able to see what we wrote about and what it all looked like.
Normally, we’re not ones to brag or self-promote, but 100 years is something we’re very proud of. The editor’s office is a treasure trove of journalism awards. Inside, there’s a bookcase, which has had slats removed to create a makeshift trophy case. Within the case, accolades span the last 100 years: Awards range from a 1937 All-American Honor Rating to a first-place 1969 general excellence award from the California Newspaper Publishers Association to the national — highly coveted — Pacemaker Award in 1990-91. And the desk — the one where this is being written — in the editor’s office is full, not of pens, pencils, paper clips or whatever else you might think an editor would have, but its drawers are full of more recent awards, special edition DTs and yellowed sheets of significant clippings.
The DT was there when Upton Sinclair addressed graduates; we were there when then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted his honorary degree; we were there, in 1950, when the era’s beloved mascot,Tirebiter, was declared “dead”; we were there when our own fellow ’SC alumnus, Neil Armstrong, recorded his first steps on the moon; we were there to cover the 1992 L.A. riots; and we were there when President Barack Obama came to campus to rally fellow Trojans.
Point being, we have a history of being there for the university. We were there for our readers one century ago. We’re here now. And for as long as possible, we’re going to have USC covered.

Historic American newspapers, such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, have all passed the 100-year mark. As of Sunday, the Daily Trojan joined the club.
The first issue of the DT, then called The Daily Southern Californian, was published Sept. 16, 1912, after W.R. “Ralph” La Porte, the first student editor of the paper, persuaded university President George Finley Bovard to give USC a student newspaper. Subscriptions to the paper originally cost $1.75.
Daily Trojan Archives
Typical articles in the first editions of the paper included announcements of tryouts for the USC rugby team and accounts of the school’s and city’s thriving social scene. But since its inception, the DT has documented history locally and nationally. The paper even landed an exclusive interview with President Richard Nixon — the first interview granted after Nixon’s resignation from public office. And when Los Angeles was rocked by riots in 1992, the DT reported in the midst of the events that took place so close to campus.
In 1915, the newspaper dropped “daily” from its name, after it began publishing only four days a week, until 1925, when it returned to daily production and its title changed to the Daily Trojan.
Soon after switching to a five-day publishing schedule, the DT began to look more extensively beyond campus for news.
Professor Joe Saltzman, DT editor in chief from 1960 to 1961, recalled the DT competing with major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times for circulation and said it was not uncommon for stories from the USC paper to wind up in larger publications.
“We became minor celebrities and the excitement of seeing your story appear in a major metropolitan newspaper when you were a junior or a senior is one of my favorite memories,” Saltzman said of his time at the DT.
Daily Trojan Archives
One of these occasions occurred when President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited USC in 1935.
Roosevelt received an honorary doctorate from the university. Crippled by polio, Roosevelt arrived at Bovard Auditorium in an open car and stood on the steps to receive his honorary doctorate. USC President Rufus B. Von KleinSmid was reportedly enraged at DT Editor in Chief Cecil Carle because of the story’s headline: “FDR Receives Drive-In Degree.”
Carle later told Roosevelt about the debacle when he was working on the president’s White House press staff. According to Carle, Roosevelt found the incident amusing and kept a framed copy of the article on his wall.
Roosevelt wasn’t the only president to be featured in the paper: Richard Nixon, in April 1975, granted former Editor in Chief Kari Granville an interview.
“He was sweating,” Granville said of Nixon. When Granville sat down with Nixon after a Board of Trustees meeting, she became the first journalist in the country to interview the president after he stepped down from office.
The DT again played a historic role when the L.A. riots broke out around campus in 1992.
Daily Trojan Archives
Though the newspaper staff had already finished its regular printing schedule for the semester, the students chose to print a special edition of the paper. Mona Cravens, the director of USC Student Publications, said the newspaper staff members felt obligated to keep their peers informed of the progression of the riots, and how the riots affected USC, as part of their duties as journalists.
“This was their means of communicating with students, how exams would be made up, whatever,” Cravens said. “So it was extremely critical that there be a Daily Trojan to communicate that.”
Two years later, the 1994 Northridge earthquake put the staff in a similar situation. When Cravens unlocked the door of the newsroom, she found the ceiling had collapsed on top of the computers. Fortunately, the system still worked and the students put out a regular edition of the paper.
“You just do what you can. We would have put a paper out that day if we had to go somewhere else to typeset,” Cravens said. “We would have found a way.”
A function of the bigger format of the early DT newspapers, as well as the journalism industry at that time, was that the DT was often taken much more seriously.
“The power of the college newspaper in the late 1950s and 1960s was far greater than it is today,” Saltzman said.
Daily Trojan Archives
In recent years, the paper has shifted to a smaller format. USC Archivist Claude Zachary said this has come at a cost.
“The thing that I’ve noticed, [which] I guess is just indicative of budgetary concerns or whatever, is the older Daily Trojans back in the ’30s, ’40s, ’50s, ’60s seem to have a lot more news,” Zachary said. “It was bigger format for one thing.”
Though the paper has gone through many changes over the years, Zachary said the original purpose of the DT has remained the same.
“It’s always been a teaching tool for journalism students as well as [for] presenting news and community service to the student body and the whole Trojan community for that matter,” Zachary said.
Saltzman said, during his tenure, staff members were very conscious of the paper’s history.
“The editors before us had become quite famous in the field, working at some of the best newspapers in the country, and we tried very hard to follow in their footsteps,” Saltzman said.

Original Date of Publication: Nov. 20, 1987
Some Trojans will do anything to get the USC name around before the big game against UCLA. Ken Domer and 13 of his friends did — or at least they tried early Thursday morning when they attempted to change the landmark HOLLYWOOD sign to read “USC! WOOD.”
Unfortunately for the 14 freshmen, their Trojan message was never seen because police spotted them just as they had finished transforming the sign and made them change it back to its original condition.
Domer said he thought of changing the sign for Troy Week several weeks ago and then told his buddies, who live with him on the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residence Hall, about it. They began plotting three weeks ago. They climbed up to the HOLLYWOOD sign and took its measurements.
Joel Zink | Daily Trojan
They purchased more than $200 worth of black and white fabric in the garment district. They spent several nights sewing pieces together until 3 or 4 a.m. to create their message, Domer said.
The group left campus at 1:30 a.m. Thursday, excited and ready for its caper.
Two students stayed at the bottom of the hill to take pictures of their accomplishment; the other 12 climbed up to the sign and busily draped the fabric over the 55-foot high letters. At 4:10, after spending an hour and a half perfecting their message, the conspirators were spotted by police helicopters circling overhead.
The helicopter hovered over the sign for about 15 minutes. Officers inside threatened the students, Domer said. The students then saw two police cars coming and knew it was all over.
Ten police officers made the students “line up with our hands behind our back” and took their names and drivers license numbers, Domer said.
The officers also made them remove the fabric.
One of the officers had attended UCLA, so the officers made a “hell of a lot” of jokes about USC, Domer said.
The students tried to respond with as many jokes about UCLA as possible — without getting themselves in any more trouble, Domer said. Although the police lectured the freshmen about their prank, “they were having a good time busting us,” he said.
The officers said that the students could either walk the two to three miles down the hill or run. But they added that “if you walk, we’ll book you,” Domer said.
The students ran shouting SoCal spell-outs and singing a parody version of the UCLA fight song.
Police turned the students’ names over to a city attorney and said charges would be pressed only if there was damage to the sign.
“One of our goals was not to damage the sign,” said Mike McManus, one of the pranksters.
Even though their message did not stay in place very long, Domer said they made their point, took their pictures and had a lot of fun. Changing the sign was something “I’ve always wanted to do,” Domer said.
“My mom called me saying she had heard that some USC students changed the sign and just asked me, ‘Why did you do it?’ She then said, ‘We’ll talk over Thanksgiving.’”
Domer, undaunted, said he has “got another plan for next year.” He wouldn’t elaborate.
The other students involved were: Rick Johnson, Greg Lucas, Jim Spizzeri, Steve Semon, Greg Jackson, Jim Lindley, Pat Conway, Chip Daniels, Tim Rosenfield, Ting Sing, Brian Daniel, Eddie Lee and Mike Marko.

As the Daily Trojan celebrates its 100-year anniversary, photographers no longer have to manually develop their film, editors don’t have to bike east of the Harbor Freeway to lay out their stories and staff members aren’t tied down writing their stories on manual typewriters in the newsroom.
Though technology at the DT has evolved, the basic production process has stayed the same. After a reporter submits the story, it’s edited by section editors, copy editors, managing editors and the editor in chief. Pages are laid out, proofread and sent to the printer. The next morning, completed copies of the paper hit newsstands for readers to pick up.
Mona Cravens, who started work at USC Student Publications in 1976 and became director of student publications in 1982, said, though the production process has essentially stayed the same, the execution has changed dramatically.
Technostalgia| In 1979, the DT switched from typewriters to computers to streamline the film developing process. — Daily Trojan file photo 

During the newspaper’s early production days in 1912, reporters had to go into the paper’s offices to write their stories on manual typewriters. According to the 1928 El Rodeo, this process became more convenient for staff members when the paper’s offices were relocated in 1928 from the Moneta Print Shop, which was located on Jefferson Street, to the Student Union.
“Being in the center of all student offices, the Trojan reporters were aided in making contacts more readily than when the office was away from campus,” El Rodeo reported.
Though the newsroom was located on campus, editors were unable to complete their production entirely in Student Union. Until the 1980s, students edited stories at an off-site location.
“Several times each night, various editors rode bikes from the Student Union a couple of blocks east of the Harbor Freeway at Exposition Boulevard to Graphic Services, a USC printing department, to deliver batches of articles and photographs,” Cravens said.
One of the people who would help produce the paper at Graphic Services was Ron Flores, who has been working in DT production for 42 years and currently works as the DT’s nightly production manager.
For each section, Flores would retype stories on paper tape, develop the tape by running it through a film processer and print out stories on a long piece of film called a galley, which he would cut out and paste to a board to create section proofs.
When editors finished editing proofs, usually around 2 a.m., Flores drove the paste-up boards to a Glendale, Calif. print shop for the final stages of the production process. At times, this proved problematic, but none so much as during the 1992 L.A. riots, when the DT finished production after the curfew put in place by the city.
“It was so eerie. No one was on the streets but the National Guard,” Flores said, recalling the drive to Glendale. “There were just the police and the National Guard and the burning buildings. It was kind of scary. … I just thought, ‘I can’t believe I’m doing this.’”
In 1979, this process was streamlined when the DT cut out the film developing process by writing stories on computers, which Flores could use to directly print the galleys. The transition, however, was not an easy one. Steve Padilla, the DT’s editor in chief in 1982 and a current Los Angeles Times editor, said system crashes kept the paper from being published at least once during his tenure.
“Our computers were so bad we would sometimes switch mid-day from computers to typewriters and go to a printer in Glendale [to finish production of the paper],” Padilla said in an email. “I saw the sun rise from the DT office about three times because we stayed all night.”
Scott Smith, the associate director of Student Publications and the DT’s spring 2001 editor in chief, described his time on the paper as a “partial-digital” production: Editors had access to computers, but Flores still used a manual process to assemble stories and ads on pages.
“If any [equipment] were to break down, we would be dead in the water,” Cravens said. “There were times where it didn’t work, and we had to take [Flores] … and some of the students up to the printer in Glendale and re-keyboard the paper for the next day on their machines.”
Flores said he worried while working with computers during the partial-digital era because of their unreliability. There was no backup in place, and production would have to be moved to the printers’ offices or back to old “hot type” machines.
In the late 1990s, the DT began transitioning to a fully digital production by creating an online version of the paper. The original website, created in 1996, was hosted on usc.edu, and editors had the labor-intensive job of scanning in and posting still-black-and-white graphics and pictures.
After the turn of the millennium, the DT continued its technological growth by switching to a color-printed edition, moving to its current DailyTrojan.com web domain and expanding the use of computers in the newsroom. In 2005, the DT switched to the completely digital system it uses today, which allows Flores to send pages to the printer electronically.
“Everything works so well now,” Flores said. “Back then I would work my a– off … but I paid my dues. I was always here and ready to get the paper out, and stayed no matter what happened.”
This fully digital production still came with its own set of technological mishaps, from crashing pages to power outages.
“[Once, there was] no power to the building for Sunday production, so [Cravens] and I gathered up computers … and had to have editors come to her house and produce the paper there,” Smith said. “There was a lot of moving things around on flash drives. Working with adversity is always interesting.”
Today, the DT’s newest challenge is building its web presence. Editors now have the ability to work with video, podcasts and photo galleries to provide content in new ways.
Smith said the goal of the paper has always been to use technology to prepare students for their future careers in journalism.
“Our goal is always to be at the cutting edge of what’s being used,” Smith said. “We are sometimes several years ahead of what’s being used at commercial papers … [and] it really is an advantage when students graduate and go out into their careers.”
Despite the technological challenges and the changes over the past 100 years, Cravens said what makes the DT significant is its ability to continue producing content no matter what roadblocks appear.
“Those were some of the best experiences because it demonstrated how solid our team was,” Cravens said. “When things go wrong, there is always a spirit of ‘can do’ that goes throughout our organization. … [Everyone feels] very committed to getting that paper out the next day.”

In 100 years of production, the Daily Trojan has seen numerous notable editors in chief, from Olympic athletes to Los Angeles Times editors to the former chairman of the Times Mirror Co.
While some editors, such as Jeff Tylicki, covered the Olympics, others competed in the Games.
Charles Paddock served as the Daily Trojan’s eighth editor in chief in 1920-21, but he had already achieved fame as a track and field athlete at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He won gold medals in the 100-meter race and 4 x 100-meter relay as well as silver in the 200-meter race.
“[He] was not only the fastest runner at USC but he was known as ‘The Fastest Human in the World’ after winning a gold medal in the 1920 Olympics,” said Frank Sotomayor, adviser to the DT.

Paddock also competed in the 1924 and 1928 Olympic Games and was featured in the film “Chariots of Fire.” He served in the Marine Corps during World War II and was killed in an air crash in Alaska in 1943.
Many former editors went on to work at the Los Angeles Times, mixing generations of DT alumni, from 1970 Editor in Chief Roger Smith to 2010 Editor in Chief Kate Mather.
Robert Erburu, who served as editor in chief in 1951-52, became the chairman of the Times Mirror Co. in 1986. At the time, the company owned eight newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times.
He remained involved in USC, serving as founding board chairman of the Pacific Council on International Policy, but has since retired. In 2005, the university announced the endowed Robert F. Erburu Chair in Ethics, Globalization and Development.
The DT has served as a training ground for hundreds of journalists who have gone on to distinguished careers, such as humor writer Art Buchwald.
Buchwald attended USC in the late 1940s, studying journalism and writing columns for the DT. He dropped out before finishing his journalism degree and moved to Paris, where he was a correspondent for Variety. In 1962, he began writing a political satire column, which earned him the nickname the “Wit of Washington” and gained him fame as it appeared in more than 500 newspapers nationwide.
In the 1980s, he established the Art Buchwald Scholarship, which is awarded for humor writing to a student on April Fool’s Day.
In 1993, USC awarded him an honorary doctorate.
Many former editors who went on to careers beyond journalism, from business to law to education, said their time at the DT taught them invaluable lessons about writing, reporting and decision-making that they still use today:
“The Daily Trojan was exactly like the professional newspapers surrounding the campus. It was like working in the real world of journalism. In Southern California, most of the people working on newspapers either had not gone to school or had gone to USC School of Journalism. It was one grand family.”
Joe Saltzman served as editor in chief during the 1960-61 academic year. He is now the director of the Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture and a professor of journalism at Annenberg.
“I practically lived in that building, in the newsroom, for months, weeks on end. … Among other things, it was just a heck of a lot of fun. Aside from seriously having a chance to learn the craft, it was also just a tremendously fulfilling experience because you’re working with these energetic and often terribly funny people.”
Steve Padilla served as editor in chief in spring 1982. He is now an assistant national editor at the Los Angeles Times.  
“The most important thing I learned was that ultimately, the big decisions lay with me and I had to trust myself on them. Obviously there was always pushback from certain student groups who felt they were being covered unfairly, but even I had professors trying to get me fired or expelled for covering them. But I tried to just tell myself and my staff that if we were being fair and working hard, we would land on our feet, and we did.”
Sara Libby served as editor in chief in fall 2005. She is now transitioning from being an associate editor at Talking Points Memo to managing editor at Voice of San Diego.
“You can be an editor at a lot of college papers, but when you work at the Daily Trojan, the chance for you to cover truly high-profile things and compete with high-profile outlets is something that is completely unique to working for the student newspaper at USC. Personally, my favorite part is my best friends were the people I met through the paper. You combine this atmosphere of learning and thinking on your feet and you get to do it every single day with people that are life-long friends.”
Kate Mather served as editor in chief in fall 2010. She is now a writer for the Los Angeles Times. 
“I learned a lot about how big of an impact a newspaper can have in a community and that can never be taken lightly, that you’re sort of the mirror for the community, and it’s important to treat that with respect and care.”
Jennifer Mir, then Jennifer Hamm, was editor in chief in fall 1997. She is now the director of practice and development at Munger Tolles & Olson LLP.
“Very rarely, especially as a young reporter, do you ever get to witness the entire production of a newspaper.”
Joanna Lin served as editor in chief in fall 2007. She is now a reporter for the California Watch.
“It’s really valuable to learn to write on real deadlines. When you don’t turn in a story in your journalism class, you might get an F. If you don’t turn in a [Daily Trojan] story, there is a big gaping hole in the paper, and that is not acceptable.”
Elisa Ung served as editor in chief in fall 1998. She now reviews restaurants for the Record in New Jersey.
“One of the hardest things [about working for USC Student Publications] is really learning to resist the temptation to get too involved. One of our big goals here in our office is to leave the Daily Trojan as open and student-operated as possible and let the students learn from the experience as I learned from that experience.”
Scott Smith served as editor in chief in spring 2001. He is now the associate director of USC Student Publications.
“I think about the Daily Trojan probably on a daily basis, planning that [journalism] class. I think a lot about Mona and how she operated as an adviser. I think about her, and I think about the DT every day and in every plan. I have all the newspapers from when I was editor in a three-ring binder.”
Brian Reed served as editor in chief in fall 2004. He now teaches English and journalism at Animo Pat Brown High School in Los Angeles.
“One of the biggest things when I think of the Daily Trojan was all the prep we did for the ’84 Olympic Games. … We had reporters that had the Olympic Committee on speed dial; they knew us by our first names.”
Jeff Tylicki was editor in chief in fall 1985. He is now the advertising manager for USC Student Publications. 
“The daily grind, being a part of it, being in the mix every day, sort of prepared me for the real world when I started doing this. Basically, the real-life experience you got from working in a real newsroom, an independent newsroom with similarly minded colleagues who wanted to ferret out the truth and write the good stories and cover their university as best they could — it was a great experience.”
Nick Divito served as editor in chief in spring 1996. He now freelances and works part time for Courthouse News Service in Las Vegas.

For college students, student-run university newspapers and other university publications serve as a constant, always readily available as a source of community information and a snapshot of the campus experience.
But student publications, small and large, provide more than just a slate of stories: They offer students a place to learn professional skills while serving a community and upholding the accountability of journalists and the university. The Daily Trojan’s 100th anniversary provides a special opportunity to understand how student publications have played an indelible role in American history and why they will continue to break important stories and produce groundbreaking journalists.
College publications have a storied history in the fabric of American discourse, beginning in 1799 with the publication of the Dartmouth Gazette (now called The Dartmouth and considered to be the first American college newspaper). Several newspapers from Rutgers, Yale, Columbia and other universities followed suit, and the world of college newspapers never looked back.
Today’s scene of multimedia-integrated, social media savvy publications might appear to be a far cry from that era, but the foundations remain unchanged. Though standards might vary from newsroom to newsroom, the nation’s top college papers adhere to strict journalistic principles, including fairness, accuracy and ethical publishing, and attempt to report on critical stories that affect the student body and the community surrounding the campus.
It’s clear how a genuine pursuit of journalistic excellence has succeeded, as college publications have often been at the forefront of some of the most important stories in history. The Daily Trojan, for one, was granted the first interview with Richard Nixon after his resignation in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. More recently, the Daily Trojan’s reporting from the heart of the 1992 L.A. riots gave the broader L.A. community critical information in a time when chaos reigned supreme.
But a student publication does more than report stories: It trains generation after generation of journalists for the realities of a professional career in the field. Some of the finest journalists in the business cut their teeth at college newspapers and numerous alumni have racked up accolades in their professional careers.
“The experience is invaluable — it is a place to learn your craft because journalism is one of those jobs that you can only learn by doing,” says Steve Padilla, former Daily Trojan editor in chief and current assistant national editor at the Los Angeles Times. “In a lot of ways, the standards of working at a student newspaper and a bigger publication are the same. The goal is always professional standards.”
But in spite of striving for professionalism, student publications often face harsh attacks and unfair assumptions regarding their merit, integrity and value. Sometimes these attacks come from the top-down, as with what happened last month at the University of Georgia’s independent student newspaper, The Red and Black.
The paper’s board of directors attempted to install an “editorial director” to check off on all published content and hired professional staffers with veto power over students’ editorial decisions. The board’s memo also attempted to influence the type of content permissible, specifically in regard to what it defined as “bad” content (“content that catches people or organizations doing bad things”).
Such blatant efforts to tailor an independent student publication to the expectations of an institution aren’t new, but college newspapers also receive attacks from other angles, often from individuals who do not understand the sheer time and effort that goes into the accurate, fair reporting and writing of stories, especially when the subject material becomes negative in nature.
“There’s a lot of forces in a university that work against candor and honest confrontation: alumni pride, people who don’t want to read about controversy, those who are more concerned about the institution’s image,” says Geneva Overholser, director of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “It’s easy for people to also dismiss student journalism as being invalid or unprofessional. But in many cases, it’s the students who know and push to tell the truth, whatever it may be.”
The doubt in student publications is a shame, considering that student-run newspapers now need more support than ever in light of challenges facing journalism programs across the country.
“Journalism classes are being crowded out by the urgency to drill students on core standardized-testing subjects,” Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, wrote in The New York Times. “And image-conscious school administrators are removing some of the profession’s best teachers in retaliation for student writing that’s considered excessively negative or controversial.”
Though USC students are lucky to have a thriving journalism school on campus, LoMonte’s points reassert that student publications stand as some of the last strongholds of journalism education. It’s clear that supporting student publications means more than just acknowledging the hard work of student journalists; it means standing up for the basic journalistic tenets of truth, fairness, accuracy and ethics in a time when much of media discourse relies on hyperbole and subjective reasoning.
No one can predict the future of media, especially considering the many transitions the world of journalism now faces. Still, one thing remains obvious: Campus publications, including the Daily Trojan, will undoubtedly continue to forge a path for journalistic excellence in the decades to come.

 Original Date of Publication: Aug. 28, 1984
After every medal, milestone and memory had been sufficiently recounted from this summer’s Olympic Games, another special group of athletes that went virtually unnoticed also brought home the gold to its loyal followers.
This diverse team, comprised from such athletic powers as the United States and West Germany, as well as the smaller nations of Finland and Jamaica, shared a common bond familiar to every Olympiad since 1904. Its overall medal count of nine gold, 11 silver and four bronze placed it in a tie with Australia in 10th place.
Just what delegation distinguished itself from so many other countries at the XXIIIrd Olympiad?
Joel Zink | Daily Trojan
While these athletes competed for different nations, they all carried on the Olympic tradition which has become so prominent at the University of Southern California. Past, present and future Trojans hauled in more medals than ever before, with many athletes bringing home the gold in their own backyard.
Heading the list of Trojan winners were the three gold medals earned by members of the men’s volleyball team. Half of the starting lineup featured former USC Trojans: setter Dusty Dvorak, middle blocker Steve Timmons and outside hitter Pat Powers. Each played an important role in sending the United States to its first-ever medal in men’s volleyball. The significance of the gold medal was enhanced by the fact that the U.S. men’s team swept a four-match series from the Soviet Union in late May.
The USC swim stadium proved to be a welcome “home pool” as four gold medals were won in the swimming competition. Incoming freshmen Mike O’Brien and Anne Ottenbrite (representing Canada) led the way with individual golds in the men’s 1500-meter freestyle and women’s 200m breaststroke, respectively. Ottenbrite also earned a silver in the 100m breaststroke and a bronze medal in the 400m medley relay, becoming the most decorated Trojan of the Olympics.
Other gold medal swimming stars included Jeff Float in the dramatic 800m freestyle relay victory over West Germany and Chris Cavanaugh in the men’s 400m freestyle relay.
Trojan swimmer Cynthia (Sippy) Woodhead came through with a silver medal in the 200m freestyle. Woodhead’s showing in Los Angeles helped make up for the crushing blow she suffered in 1980, when the U.S. boycotted the Moscow Olympics.
West German swimmer Thomas Fahrner gave Trojan swim fans a preview of what they can expect this season as the incoming freshman gathered a silver medal in the 800m freestyle relay and a bronze in the individual 200m freestyle.
Fahrner, however, will likely be best remembered as the only competitor to set an Olympic record, yet not receive a medal. After failing to qualify for the 400m final, Fahrner came back to break the Olympic record and better the time of American gold medalist George DiCarlo in the consolation final.
Two more golds came the Trojan way as basketball stars Cheryl Miller and Pam McGee, fresh from two consecutive NCAA championships, helped the U.S. romp through the competition in women’s basketball.
Former Trojans Debbie Green, Paula Weishoff, Sue Woodstra and Carolyn Becker teamed up with returning Trojan Kim Ruddins in leading the U.S. to the gold medal final in women’s volleyball before losing to China in three games.
The silver medal was the culmination of more than six years work for Green, Woodstra and Becker, who weathered the disappointment of the 1980 boycott. Another victim of the boycott, former Trojan Terry Place Brandel, competed for the West German volleyball team.
The demonstration sport of baseball took on a decidedly cardinal and gold flavor with USC Coach Rod Dedeaux leading the team to a silver medal at Dodger Stadium. Trojans Mark McGwire and Sid Akins also competed their amateur careers as members of the Olympic team. Although both players had a remaining year of eligibility, each signed professional contracts during the summer.
The track and field competition signaled the return of former Trojan sprinter Don Quarrie. The Los Angeles games marked the fifth consecutive Olympiad in which Quarrie has participated, a record for a male sprinter. Quarrie received a gold and silver in the 1976 Montreal Games along with a bronze in Moscow.
While Trojan hurdler Tonie Campbell was an expected medalist in the 110m high hurdles, a lesser known former Trojan, Arto Bryggare of Finland, grabbed the bronze. Bryggare competed for USC in 1979 as a member of Vern Wolfe’s track team.
Another incoming Trojan to win an Olympic medal was Mission Viejo’s Wendy Wyland, bronze medalist in women’s platform diving. Many expected Wyland to repeat her World Championship performance of 1982, but a poor compulsory score eliminated the 19-year-old’s chances for a gold medal.
For Wyland, the immediate future includes four years at USC while her long-range goal remains Seoul, South Korea, and the 1988 Olympics.
All of the 1984 Trojan Olympians will be honored at halftime of the USC-Utah State football game Sept. 8 at the Coliseum.
