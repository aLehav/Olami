The Women of Troy (1-0) started off their season with a statement on Friday after pulling out a thrilling 79-73 victory over No. 22 Gonzaga (0-1) at the Galen Center.
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 21 points and 10 rebounds, while sophomore forward Christina Marinacci also chipped in with a double-double of her own, registering 16 points and 10 rebounds.
“I thought it was a very well played game by both teams,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “Even though we struggled, we continued to play hard.”
Trailing 25-14 late in the first half, the Women of Troy mounted a significant comeback, going on a 14-2 run to take a one-point lead at 28-27.
The run was highlighted by the play of senior guard Jacki Gemelos, who scored six points and set up senior center Kari LaPlante for a layup.
But after momentarily taking the lead, the Bulldogs responded with a 10-2 run of their own — a three-point play by guard Courtney Vandersloot capped the run and sent the Bulldogs into halftime leading 37-30.
Other than that three-point play by Vandersloot, the Women of Troy managed to slow down the two-time West Coast Conference Player of the Year, forcing her into a 7-of-22 shooting night.
“[Vandersloot] is a very good player, but Ashley [Corral] did a great job containing her and getting her out of her [comfort zone],” Gilbreath said.
The Women of Troy began the second half slowly cutting into the Bulldogs lead thanks to the play of Marinacci, who scored from outside, inside and helped set up her teammates off offensive rebounds.
“I knew going into the second half, if we were going to win, I needed to lead by example and have somebody for my teammates to look to,” Marinacci said.
Trailing 44-40 with 14:25 to play in the second half, the Women of Troy scored 12 unanswered points to seize the lead 52-44 with 11:41.
But in a game highlighted by runs, the Bulldogs would respond again with a 17-9 rout, knotting the game up at 61 with 5:30 left to play.
Both teams would go back and forth, with the lead changing five times in the next few minutes, but the Women of Troy took the lead for good at 69-67 on freshman Cassie Harberts layup with 3:26 remaining.
Gemelos extended the lead to four points with a layup of her own, but the Bulldogs would cut the lead to two points at 71-69 after a pair of free throws by Janelle Bekkering.
Gilbreath extended the lead to five points, 74-69, after converting a three-point play, but the Bulldogs would respond again. Two more free throws by the Bulldogs kept the game within reach at 74-71.
Still, USC refused to let the Bulldogs steal a victory at home.
A three-point play by Harberts and a shot-clock-buzzer-beating shot by Gilbreath sealed the victory for the Women of Troy.
Another bright spot for the Women of Troy was the return of redshirt sophomore guard Stefanie Gilbreath, who saw her first action in three years after having three knee surgeries.
Despite the victory, the Women of Troy struggled to take care of the ball, committing 25 turnovers.
“It’s disappointing that we came out there and had that many turnovers,” Marinacci said. “But it’s something that we really need to focus on, especially going into the Duke game.”
All in all, the coaching staff said the victory was hard-fought but knows there is room for improvement, especially going into next week’s game.
“Champions find a way to win,” Cooper said. “Overall, I wasn’t happy with the way we played, but we’re still trying to find ourselves. When we needed it though, we came through, and sometimes you can get wins just by playing hard and I thought we did that and were able to get this win.”
Today, the Women of Troy are on the road as they take on No. 5 Duke at 4 p.m.
“We’ll be ready to play,” Cooper said. “Obviously, we won’t be able to win with 25 turnovers, but if we cut that in half, we’ll be fine.”

The Trojans quickly dispelled any Long Beach State hopes of stealing an upset by jumping out to a 6-1 lead at the end of the first quarter on Saturday. From there, the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (22-2, 5-2) would cruise to a 10-4 shellacking of the 49ers.
Twice as nice · Sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal netted two goals in the Trojans’ winning effort on Saturday against Long Beach State. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
It is apparent that a team has championship aspirations when even its wins against ranked opponents are highly critiqued. Such was the case Thursday when No. 10 Pepperdine almost stunned USC in front of its home crowd, losing narrowly 7-6. After USC’s most impressive performance of the season against then-No. 3 UCLA two weeks ago, the Trojans did not beat Pepperdine all too convincingly. USC coach Jovan Vavic cited the pitfalls of fielding a young team as to why the Trojans sometimes do not play at a level more equal to their talent.
Aiming to avoid subsequent underwhelming performances, the Trojans rattled off five unanswered goals in the first quarter on Saturday against a struggling Long Beach State team that, although ranked No. 9, has now lost seven consecutive games and 10 of 11. A swarming defense from the outset was the primary reason for USC’s early success.
“At the beginning of the game, we did a good job of denying the ball to their biggest threats, which are [their two-meters Nick] Rascon and [Taylor] Clute,” Vavic said. “We intercepted some of their passes, which created opportunities for us on the counterattack.”
The Trojans, as is a staple of their team, received scoring contributions from seven different players, with freshman driver Nikola Vavic registering a hat-trick and redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal chipping in two tallies.
“Individually, Peter Kurzeka had a good game,” Jovan Vavic said. “Rosenthal played well; he scored a couple of goals for us. Nikola played well defensively and offensively. Our two-meter men also did well in drawing ejections.”
Perhaps what was most impressive was something that will not appear in a box score: the Trojans’ refusal to retaliate when battered by frustrated Long Beach State players. After the first quarter, the 49ers became testy following continually stout Trojan defensive stands. An auspicious development for the Trojans was their ability to persevere and simply allow the referees to officiate.
“Defensively, we played tough,” Jovan Vavic said. “Long Beach was very physical. I think the game was a little too physical, as a matter of fact. But our guys were able to take more than one punch without responding. In the end, I think our composure was the difference — we stayed cool.”
The Trojans, third in the MPSF standings, have the same 5-2 record in conference play as UCLA but owns the tiebreaker with its win over the Bruins, meaning if USC beats No. 5 UC Irvine this weekend, the team is assured of at least a third-place finish. To finish second, however, No. 3 Stanford will have to lose to both Pacific and California to round out its conference schedule.
Next on the docket for USC is an exhibition match against a Canadian national water polo team that finished 11th in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The game will be played Wednesday at 5 p.m. in McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
“It’s a game that will help us prepare for the conference tournament,” Jovan Vavic said. “Canada is a team on the rise, so it’s a great opportunity for us to get practice, and it’s exciting for our team.”

The No. 22 Women of Troy kicked off the NCAA tournament with a 3-1 win over No. 13 Illinois on Friday afternoon.
Final bow · Senior forward Megan Ohai, who ranks among USC’s all-time career goal leaders, played her last game with the Trojans on Sunday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“I’m happy to get the ‘W,’” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “I’m happy to get the first game in and have it go our way.”
A slow start did not hurt the Women of Troy this time, though it has earlier in the season.  Instead, they were the ones who managed to put their opponents on their heels.
“I thought the first 15 minutes, Illinois had the ball most of the time,” Khosroshahin said. “But at the halfway mark, we were able to make some changes, we settled in and started to do some good things.”
When junior forward/defender Ashley Freyer entered the game, she made an immediate impact, scoring off a perfectly placed pass over the Illini backline from junior midfielder Brittany Kerridge.
This was the junior’s first goal of her career in the NCAA tournament, and it gave the Women of Troy a 1-0 lead that would hold up until halftime.
In the beginning of the second half, the Women of Troy had multiple opportunities to score again but couldn’t find the back of the net.
In the 56th minute, the Women of Troy were awarded a free kick from just beyond midfield.
Redshirt junior midfielder/defender Ashli Sandoval drilled a shot the Illini goalkeeper was able to get a hand on, but not enough to prevent it from crossing the plane.  This goal gave the Women of Troy a 2-0 lead.
Though the Illini threatened to score and had plenty of opportunities to cut into the lead, the play of the USC backline and freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church was solid.
“I was very pleased with our backline,” Khosroshahin said.  “I thought Karter [Haug] and Mia [Bruno] were solid as were Claire [Schloemer], [Ashli] Sandoval and Shelby [Church]. [Our defense] has been our backbone all year and they were again.”
In the 74th minute, sophomore midfielder Courtney Garcia fed sophomore forward Samantha Johnson, who completed the scoring and gave the Women of Troy their highest output in goals during a NCAA tournament match.
Leading 3-0, the Women of Troy conceded a goal in the 80th minute, but the Illini would get no closer.
On Sunday, the Women of Troy couldn’t get past the No. 7 Notre Dame Fighting Irish as they fell 4-0 in the second round of the tournament, putting an end to a solid season for USC.
“We just didn’t play our best game,” said senior defender Karter Haug.  “Notre Dame came out and they played [well]. They put the ball in the goal and had a couple good bounces go their way.”
The Fighting Irish struck early on goals by midfielder Rose Augustin and defender/midfielder Lauren Fowlkes in the first eight minutes of the game to take a commanding 2-0 lead. 
“Anytime you spot a team of that caliber two goals early on, it’s a really difficult hill [to climb] and a really difficult hole to climb out of,” Khosroshahin said.
The Women of Troy had multiple opportunities to respond and cut into the lead, but shots went high, wide or were stopped by the Notre Dame goalkeeper.
At halftime, the Women of Troy came out aggressive, putting pressure on the Notre Dame backline and goalkeeper, but still no shots were able to find the back of the net.
“They were able to finish their opportunities and we weren’t,” Khosroshahin said.
Meanwhile, the Fighting Irish added to their lead on a goal by forward Melissa Henderson in the 57th minute, while forward Adriana Leon finished off the scoring in the 70th minute to give the Fighting Irish a 4-0 victory.
Despite the loss, the coaching staff said it couldn’t be more pleased with the players, specifically the leadership of the seniors and the development of the team as a whole.
“The seniors this year really led this team and they’ve led them from the beginning,” Khosroshahin said. “They did a tremendous job and I’m so proud of them, but so sad to see these young ladies leave me.  This team has grown tremendously, they’ve matured tremendously and I couldn’t be more proud.”

The setup: After a thrilling 34-33 victory over Arizona State at the Coliseum, the No. 20 Trojans traveled to Arizona to play the role of spoiler.
The story: The Trojans rode the back of redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler and the defense did just enough as USC held on to defeat the then-No. 17 Arizona Wildcats 24-21, vaulting them into a tie for third place in the Pac-10.
Fond memories of last weekend greeted the Trojans as the Wildcats started the game off missing a 34-yard field goal.
The Trojan offense turned that missed field goal into points as sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley led the offense down the field, completing five passes for 49 yards and ending the drive with a one-yard rushing touchdown to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead.
Minutes later, senior cornerback Shareece Wright forced a fumble the Trojans recovered, putting the offense in good field position to extend the lead. Three plays later, the Trojans were up 14-0 after a seven-yard touchdown strike from Barkley to redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison.
All facets of the Trojans offense — passing game and running game — were clicking in the first half, but the second half would be left up to the defense to close out the game on the road.
Defense bends but doesn’t break: The Trojans entered the game ranked 97th in total defense, allowing almost 424 yards per game, and have struggled at times while the Wildcats ranked 19th in the nation in total offense at 450.6 yards per game.
This had all the ingredients for a high-scoring affair, but the Trojan defense managed to contain the Wildcats offense just enough to secure the victory.
A recurring problem for the USC defense all year has been the inability to get any stops on third down and Saturday was no different as the Wildcats finished 11-16 on third-down conversions.
But every time the Wildcats completed long third-down conversions, they weren’t always able to convert those offensive drives into points.
With the Wildcats down 21-14 at halftime, their first drive in the second half proved critical. The Trojan defense allowed two long third-down conversions, and Wildcat quarterback Nick Foles led the offense down the field into USC territory.
Senior linebacker Malcolm Smith forced a fumble the Trojan defense recovered. Again, the offense capitalized off the turnover on a 30-yard field goal by senior kicker Joe Houston that turned out to be the game-winner.
Tale of two halves: A high-scoring first half saw an efficient USC offense score 21 points. Barkley completed 15 of 20 passes for 124 passing yards with a touchdown pass and a rushing touchdown, while Tyler rushed for 79 yards and a touchdown.
Though Barkley looked almost perfect in the first half, he would be far from it in the second half, completing only six of 15 passes for 46 yards and one interception.
The first half featured offense, but the second half would be an entirely different story as defense reigned supreme for both teams. The Trojans only managed a field goal, while the Wildcats scored on a late touchdown pass with about a minute left in the game.
Run, Marc, run: The Wildcats entered the game leading the Pac-10 in rushing defense at 102.7 yards per game, but the Trojans established the run game early and relied on of Tyler, who finished with a career-high 160 rushing yards and one touchdown.
“I felt good, I was in the zone and I was just running hard,” Tyler said.
Establishing the run game allowed the Trojans to control possession of the ball and to manage the game clock, which kept the Wildcats’ high-octane offense off the field.
“We were consistent every run … gaining five, six, seven yards and getting that first down and chewing up the clock,” senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said. “We just wanted to be consistent with that and it really clicked. We did what we had to do to pull out this victory.”
In Arizona’s two conference losses against Stanford and Oregon State, both teams outgained the Wildcats in time of possession by 14 minutes and 13 minutes respectively — Saturday, the Trojans outgained the Wildcats, keeping the ball for 15 more minutes.
“We’re all in the mindset of finishing this out and ending on a good note,” Barkley said. “Not only to send this into a good offseason, but to just finish it for the seniors … for the guys who won’t be coming back. To end on a good note is exactly what we’re trying to do.”
NICE WIN!!!

It took almost 14 months to the day for USC to extract revenge from one of the four opponents it lost to last season. For the Trojans, that moment couldn’t come soon enough.
Hot pursuit · Junior tailback Marc Tyler ran for 160 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries against Arizona, setting career highs in both yards and attempts. He led a Trojan team that jumped to an early lead in the first quarter and held on to win 24-21.  - Colleen Hoffman | El Rodeo
As sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley knelt the ball to expire the clock and secure a 24-21 advantage over Arizona late in the game Saturday night, a burden was lifted from the Trojans possibly greater in importance than any of the myriad others that remain on their backs.
USC had finally showed that, despite all of the adversity, controversy and change it has dealt with in the past year, it still has the determination and perseverance to progress as a team.
Sure, evidence backing this idea could be pulled from previous games this season — a blowout win against California, a perfect nonconference slate, a hold-on-till-the-last-second victory over Arizona State — but all those things had been done in the previous season under a well-seasoned coaching staff and a full scholarship roster. Nothing was in place to prove the Trojans were moving forward.
Until this weekend.
Although the game finished with only a three-point differential, the Trojans held the lead — and seemingly the ball — for the entire game, controlling the pace of play as they recorded scoring drives of five, seven and nine minutes. USC looked like its old self yet again but with a new twist — the Trojans’ opponent was for once not a Pac-10 cellar-dweller but a nationally ranked team.
The biggest reason behind the improvement was the play in the trenches: Both the offensive and defensive lines — areas of weakness for USC earlier in the season — overwhelmed whatever the Wildcats threw at them, giving Barkley ample time to find open receivers and holding Arizona running back Keola Antolin to only 38 yards rushing.
Compare that to the 225 yards of rushing that the defense surrendered to Washington, and it’s easy to see how far the Trojans have come in just a matter of weeks.
In fact, taking a step back and looking at the four “revenge” games themselves — Washington, Stanford, Oregon and Arizona — will show you some semblance of the learning curve the Trojans have endured this season.
The Huskies, currently 3-6 and sitting in eighth place in the Pac-10, faced USC first and didn’t waste any time in exposing just about every weakness the Trojans had managed to mask in the games prior. Washington put up 536 yards of offense and used a missed field goal from USC senior kicker Joe Houston en route to a last-second 32-31 win and the first loss of USC’s season.
To be fair, the Trojans certainly buckled down for their next game against Stanford but once again were felled more so by themselves than by the opposition. Special teams mistakes, penalties and poor secondary coverage paved a path for the Cardinal to boot another game-winning field goal, despite the late lead that USC held.
Improvement for USC, but not enough.
Although the Trojans lost to their third revenge opponent by the widest margin of any team they faced all season, it’s easy to argue that USC played a complete game for three quarters and simply failed to keep up with the best — and fastest — team in the nation: Oregon. The Trojans’ defense played well enough to keep the team in the game, and the offense used the opportunities they had to put points on the scoreboard (for the most part), going as far as taking a 32-29 lead over the Ducks midway through the third quarter.
But USC had not taken that final step in their progression — finishing games.
Cue Saturday.
USC was by no means perfect against Arizona, but it has finally come full circle in learning once again how to close out ball games. Getting to that point was not an examination of talent, but rather of the Trojans’ maturation and experience. And they passed with flying colors.
It would be easy — instinctive, almost — to roll over and allow the new talents of the Pac-10 to eclipse any glimmer of hope USC brought into this season. The Trojans have no bowl game to play for, and they have a young and limited roster playing for a new coaching staff.
But over the course of the season, and namely across these four revenge games, USC showed that it has the humility and patience to learn from its mistakes and rise to the next challenge — proving so against Arizona on Saturday.
With the way things have looked in the past two games for USC, the Trojans are excited to be on the field winning games, no matter the final goal.
And if they keep it up, soon there will be no “revenge” games left to play in the coming seasons.

USC’s game against Arizona on Saturday night featured many of the mistakes that plagued the Trojans earlier in the season. The defense gave up more than 400 yards, the offense converted less than half of its third-down attempts and turned the ball over, and the team as a whole racked up eight penalties for 60 yards.

But in what seems to be a new trend for USC, the Trojans once again pulled out a last-minute win in spite of the statistic sheets.
USC (7-3, 4-3) upset No. 18 Arizona 24-21 on a chilly night in Tucson, Ariz., exorcising some of the demons still lingering from last season’s late loss to the Wildcats in the Coliseum and marking the first win of USC’s season against a team the Trojans lost to in 2009.
“I’m just extremely excited,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “Anytime you go on the road to a top-20 team and get a win it’s extremely exciting. Anytime you go on the road you have to run the ball and play defense, which we did tonight and got the ‘W.’”
Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler carried much of the offensive load on a day that featured the Trojans holding possession of the ball for more than 37 minutes, rushing 31 times for 160 yards — career highs in both categories — and a touchdown.
“I feel good about how I played,” Tyler said. “I was able to come in with fresh legs, and I felt great. We were running the ball and controlling the clock. In the third and fourth quarter, we played efficiently on the long drives.”
The Trojans once again jumped to an early lead, scoring on their only two drives of the first quarter to claim a 14-0 advantage. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, who started the game on a hot streak by completing 14 of his first 15 attempts for 122 yards, had a hand in both of USC’s scores in the first quarter — he ran one in on a one-yard quarterback keeper and threw the second to redshirt junior tight end Rhett Ellison for the seven-yard score.
“I was just taking what the defense was giving me,” Barkley said. “A lot of the shorter routes were working, getting yards and getting first downs.”
Arizona was able to exploit the USC secondary for a quick score to begin the second quarter, but the Trojans came right back with a 17-play drive that took almost nine minutes, capping it with their third touchdown of the half on a three-yard Tyler run to make the game 21-7.
But Arizona, led by quarterback Nick Foles, responded once again, needing just more than two minutes to post their second touchdown of the night. Foles connected with receiver Travis Cobb on a 31-yard strike to bring the Wildcats’ deficit to just seven going into the half.
The second half seemed to be a reversal of roles, as the defenses that looked so porous in the first two quarters tightened up, and both offenses struggled to do anything productive in their possessions.
The Trojans managed to get into field-goal range in the third quarter, and senior kicker Joe Houston made the most of it, nailing a 30-yard attempt to put USC up 24-14.
The 10-point advantage was enough to put the Trojans ahead for good, despite a late comeback attempt from Arizona in which the Wildcats scored a touchdown with 1:01 left to play in the fourth quarter. The Wildcats were not able to recover the ensuing onside kick, and the Trojans ran the clock out for the hard-earned victory.
“Our entire program revolves around the word ‘finish,’ and that’s what it is,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “It’s the fourth quarter of the season, we have three more games left. It’s time to really finish. It was just a really great start to these next four games.”
Despite USC posting its highest total rushing yards since the Trojans’ game against Cal, the Wildcats outgained them 382-404. The teams each posted 24 first downs, but Arizona was able to convert 11 of its 16 third-down attempts, a figure that has remained a problem for USC week in and week out.
“You’re doing a good job if you get them to third down … but it doesn’t do any good if you don’t get off on third down,” defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin said. “We got to third down, but we didn’t win. It was really frustrating.”
The Trojans once again were helped by special teams, though not quite as much from their own side as from Arizona. Wildcat kicker Alex Zendejas missed a 34-yard field goal attempt on Arizona’s first drive, a blown opportunity that proved to be the difference in the final result.
Nevertheless, the Trojans remained positive and said they felt that the win was the product of a collective effort.
“With a good team like this, especially in a hostile environment, you have to have a packed defense, play tough and bring out your running game,” redshirt junior safety Marshall Jones said. “I think we did that and we came out with a ‘W’ because of it.”
The win brings USC above .500 in the conference for the first time since it was 1-0 after defeating Washington State in week four. USC will travel to Corvallis, Ore., next week to face Oregon State.
FIGHT ON TROJANS…BEAT THE BEAVERS!!

The USC School of Pharmacy helped host a health fair Saturday in Alhambra to provide medical services to the community free of charge.

The school, along with the Rotary Club of Alhambra and the Alhambra Hospital Medical Center, held the fair at the Alhambra First Baptist Chuch from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Several USC medical schools joined together to provide the resources.
“There was a lot of coordination that went into this. We set out to make this an interdisciplinary health fair, so we contacted all the various professional schools at USC,” said Co-Director Elect of the PharmSC Clinic Richard Dang, a graduate student studying pharmacy. “We have different schools coming out and coming together for one health fair so as to provide interdisciplinary services for the population.”
Pharmacy students, along with students in the physician assistant program at the Keck School of Medicine, gave hypertension screenings to check for high blood pressure, blood sugar tests and foot screenings to check for diabetes, scoliosis screenings, pulse oximetry screenings and free flu shots.
Students from the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC gave oral cancer screenings and hosted a dental hygiene education booth. Students from the USC Occupational Sciences and Occupational Therapy program helped run other educational booths.
The Doheney Eye Institute gave eye exams for children in a mobile vision van, and the Alhambra Hospital Medical Center also screened patients to check for high cholesterol and risk of stroke.
Raymond Poon, a 1971 pharmacy graduate and adviser of PharmSC, said a health fair was held last year at the Alhambra YMCA in coordination with the School of Pharmacy but did not have as many different schools involved.
“This is the first time the School of Pharmacy is in collaboration with the School of Dentistry and the School of Physical Therapy. It makes our service spectrum a lot wider,” Poon said. “Before we only concentrated on diabetes, cholesterol, but now we can concentrate on physical therapy and other services.”
PharmSC Co-Director Elect Raymond Chao, a graduate student studying pharmacy, said that the collaboration reflects the larger goals in healthcare.
“As a whole, we’re trying to push the idea that we need a collaborative effort for the healthcare profession because healthcare isn’t just one provider; it’s a bunch of people coming together,” Chao said.
The current economic climate also makes having different health services available in one place convenient for the community.
“A lot of people are unemployed and probably lost their insurance and probably don’t realize how important preventive health and good health is to the family and to themselves,” Poon said.
Dang also said that “the fact that it’s more accessible and free is what helps draw out the community members.”
“We’ve always been doing this — as far as outreach in the community,” said Melissa Durham, a lecturer at the School of Pharmacy. “[But] with rising healthcare costs and the number of uninsured reaching record highs, we’ve seen a larger response from the community population who are seeing the value in these clinics.”
Durham said that service, in addition to instilling a sense of value, helps students practice communication skills as well as clinical skills.
“Our pharmacy students are at the forefront of community outreach out of all of our health professional schools,” she said. “In the fall semester, our students are out doing health fairs every other week in all different areas of Southern California. This is the first time we’ve been at this particular site having this one event because we’re always establishing new events everywhere.”
The event also included information booths regarding nutrition, osteoporosis, immunization, cancer, poison prevention, geriatric care, pain management, heartburn awareness and body fat.
“Health fairs are great opportunities to reach members of the community that don’t have access to routine healthcare,” Dang said. “It’s been a great experience just to be able to come out to the Alahambra community and help the community members.”
Such type of health fairs play a big role to collect more information about it ..

At first, The Music Box was eerily quiet. From behind the deep red curtains, the familiar rocking sounds of an acoustic guitar suddenly filled the theater. The abrupt flow of crisp guitar riffs and drumbeats jolted the hibernating crowd to life.
KT Tunstall mixed a wide array of instruments and a heavy amount of humorous crowd interaction to craft an entertaining and fast-paced show, one that showed the singer could play her songs live just as well, if not better than, the studio versions. - Esther Kang | Daily Trojan 
“Hello Los Angeles,” said a voice with a thick Scottish accent. As the crowd recognized the voice and erupted into applause, the night’s headliner made her way onstage.
From the moment Scottish singer/songwriter KT Tunstall took the stage, it was clear that she and Los Angeles were very fond of each other. Thursday’s concert was just the latest example in a series of positive experiences with the city and the singer.
Tunstall and her band, which were in town as part of the first leg of their North American tour to promote her third studio album Tiger Suit, kicked off the night with an energetic jam featuring high notes and familiar punch lines.
It was immediately clear that Tunstall has a very likable stage personality. First off, she was extremely sassy, cooing in a powerful accent that mixed well with her leather leggings and selection of guitars. But even as she commanded the stage with her attitude, she still showed off a strong level of appreciation for her crowd.
Equally as amusing was the crowd itself, which spent the night — in between listening attentively to her songs — shouting exclamations of praise as well as other, more odd comments. At one point, a man shouted at Tunstall, “Have my babies,” to which she sprightly replied, “Sorry, I’ve been booked,” sending waves of laughter through the crowd.
From her easy-going aura to her quick-witted humor, Tunstall knew how to command a room. None of this, however, compared to the spectacle she put on at one point in the show as she played with just her strong voice and loop pedal.
She mixed upbeat chords and catchy beats by looping her guitar, all the while clapping and whistling.
When she sang her hit track “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree,” she showed that she really can rock out live and wasn’t beholden to studio production tricks, as the performance was energetic and powerful — and it sounded just as good, if not better than the studio version.
That isn’t to say that she totally eclipsed her backing band. The four-piece group — with guitar, bass, keyboard, drums and the occasional trumpet and accordion — jammed intensely through the night, matching Tunstall’s energy song for song. They complemented Tunstall’s bouncing vigor, never overpowering her but still essential to the show.
Toward the middle of her set, Tunstall took the time to introduce every band member and his respective hometowns — giving listeners a more personal band intro than usual.
The set ranged from a sentimental ballad about messy break-ups (which she dedicated to an audience member who vociferously admitted to having been dumped recently) to a lively jam (whistling and clapping included) that she said she wrote with late-night television host Craig Ferguson.
The audience was largely comprised of presumably devout followers, many of whom sang along to the lyrics during every song. Although the demographics definitely skewed toward an older generation, that didn’t stop them from grooving along to both new and familiar melodies performed by Tunstall and the band.
The night closed with an encore performance of her breakout single, “Suddenly I See,” which Tunstall — in another display of her characteristic humor — dedicated it to “all the boyfriends who were dragged here by their girlfriends but don’t really want to be here.”
It was quite the refreshing finish to a solid set.
“I really, really love Los Angeles,” Tunstall said to the crowd at one point during the night. “I’m really not brown-nosing or anything. In fact, I had a little too much fun last night.”
A loud voice from the back replied.
“L.A. loves you too, KT.”
I believe the whistly-and-clappy song you mention is “Still A Weirdo,” and the co-writer in question is Greg Kurstin of The Bird and the Bee, not “TV’s Craig Ferguson.”  Not that a Tunstall-Ferguson collaboration would be a bad thing.  :-)
Thanks, though, for a lovely, positive review.  KT does put on one hell of a live show.

Determined to educate people about the history of East Asia, a USC professor of international relations and business began writing a book three years ago to achieve just that.
Diplomatic relations · Professor David Kang has been teaching at USC for two years and is the director of the Korean Studies Institute. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
David Kang recently released his latest book, East Asia Before the West: Five Centuries of Trade and Tribute, saying that most people are only taught about Europe’s historical international relations and rarely learn about how the East Asian countries interacted in their history.
“The main point is to show that historical East Asian international relations was complex and vibrant and as nuanced as was Europe’s historical international relations,” Kang said.
He first developed the idea for his book a decade ago but only started writing it three years ago.
Kang said despite the fact that these Asian countries are important today, people tend to not know anything about how the countries interacted with one another 30 years ago, before they were integrated into the global society.
“[It’s important to] make people more aware and present people with some knowledge of this time in a readable way, so that when we try to make sense of Asia today we have some sense of how it got to today,” Kang said. “We talk about China and Japan with no knowledge of how they came to be.”
One of the most interesting things about East Asian history, Kang said, is that between 1300 and 1800 there was very little war between the countries themselves.
He notes that it wasn’t the fact that the countries didn’t have the means to fight wars — the countries did have large armies. This was an interesting contrast to European countries, he said, which were constantly at war with each other.
“War wasn’t in their minds the same way it’s not in our mindset that we might invade Canada. We could, but that’s not the way it is,” he said. “Historically, these countries had stable relationships. Among themselves they saw each other as legitimate.”
Kang began teaching at USC two years ago, after teaching at Dartmouth College. He is a professor in both international relations and business administration and teaches International Relations for non-majors (IR 101) and East Asian Societies (EASC 150).
In addition to teaching, Kang has also been the director of the Korean Studies Institute since he came to USC. The institute is still relatively young, he said, but he has big ambitions for the center.
The institute supports all research that has to do with Korea, and it is available to undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty. It also helps with research grants, holds conferences and sponsors a traditional Korean drumming troop.
The institute hosts speakers and public events, and according to Kang, the United States ambassador to South Korea will be speaking this winter.
USC is in the perfect position to make the institute the best in the world, Kang said, because of the location in Los Angeles and the resources that the school has as a private university.
“The overall mission is to educate USC students,” Kang said. “The vision is to be the best Korean studies institute in the world. We have a realistic chance to do that.”

USC ALIVE, an environmental student group, has launched a university-wide campaign to inform students that USC Hospitality does not purchase its eggs from cage-free farms, as UCLA and several other University of California schools do, in hopes to creating change at USC.
Animal rights · James Nalto (right), a senior majoring in accounting and finance, signs a petition to stop using eggs from caged chickens. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
USC buys its eggs from battery cage factory farms, which USC ALIVE says treats chickens cruelly.
“In battery farms, hens are stuffed into cages with no room,” said Connie Gao, ALIVE’s director of external communications. “The cages are stacked on top of each other, so feces filters down. The hens end up covered in feces and so does their eggs.”
As of Friday, more than 1,000 students signed ALIVE’s petition to try to convince the university to go cage-free, Gao said.
“I hope it will be enough to change the university’s mind,” she said.
When hens are raised in a cage-free environment, they can exercise, spread their wings, and lay eggs in nests, Gao said, making the cage-free environment more sustainable and yield healthier eggs.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said he met with the president of Wilcox Farms, a company that sells cage-free eggs to several universities, to discuss making USC a new customer.
“They said they didn’t have enough product in their distribution channels right now, but we do plan on switching. We’re just not sure when,” Klinger said.
One of the university’s primary concerns is the cost of cage-free eggs, Klinger said, a consideration that factors into all of USC Hospitality’s decisions. For example, USC Hospitality’s decision to offer students the Trojan Plan, an unlimited meal plan, is expensive for the university.
“It did cost the university more money,” Klinger said.
According to Klinger, Wilcox Farms, Stanford’s new provider, is currently unable to fulfill the demands of another large university such as USC. He said the earliest USC would go cage-free is next fall.
“We understand it is the right thing to do,” Klinger said. “We just want to make sure it makes financial sense.”
The cost per egg should not be a factor, said Lindsay Wolf, campaign director of the Humane Alliance in Southern California, a new branch of the Humane League, which has been promoting cage-free eggs with universities on the East Coast.
“Cage-free adds a couple of pennies per egg, and in the long run students will pay about 10 cents more for an omelet,” Wolf said.
At every university Wolf has worked, she said she has found the majority of students to be supportive of the cage-free alternative.
“Ninety percent of students say they’ll pay more for a healthier and tastier egg,” she said.
Many universities in California, including UCLA and Stanford have made the switch to cage free.
Because voters passed Proposition 2, operating a battery cage farm will be illegal beginning in 2015.
“Battery cages are criminal activity,” Gao said. “They treat their animals and workers badly.”
When chicken feces are not disposed of, they accumulate, exposing workers to high amounts of ammonia, Gao said, adding that feces-covered eggs are much more likely to be contaminated with salmonella.
USC ALIVE created the petition to eradicate USC Hospitality’s qualms about the increased cost.
“Right now USC is hesitant because they’re not sure if students will be willing to pay a little more,” Wolf said. “The petition shows [the university] that students are aware and want to make the switch.”
Who’s the chick with the glasses. She looks horny,lol
That would be me, John. I’m the Campaign Director for The Humane Alliance of Southern California and the one helping ALIVE with their cage-free campaign.
What a great article – thank you so much Conrad for sharing this issue with the USC community!
Conrad-
Great article, thanks so much for letting us know about this issue! It’s great that USC plans on switching to cage-free and that ALIVE and other students are pushing for this change! I hope that USC will commit to going cage-free for the fall, for the sake of the environment, the animals, and student health!
Nick
Not sure what you mean by saying that “USC Hospitality’s decision to offer students the Trojan Plan, an unlimited meal plan, is expensive for the university.” Trojan Plan is just a prepaid account of $3050 that students can debit against during the semester. I would presume that it would be highly profitable for the university, considering that they lock in freshmen who have it to buying food only on campus, and that they charge rather exorbitant amounts for use of their facilities ($12 for dinner at EVK/Parkside if I remember correctly).
It’s more likely that you meant to refer to the reformed Cardinal Plan, which was changed this year to allow unlimited meals in EVK and Parkside. This meal plan, which is the default for freshmen in regular housing, probably does cost the school more than it used to when it was capped at ten meals per week. As I recall, they cut the price of the plan by ~$300, took away the dining dollars that came with it (also ~$300), and changed it to having unlimited meals.
Because Trojan Plan was left at its previous price, instead of costing $300 more a semester, it costs $600 more. If fewer people sign up for it because of the price difference, that makes for more lost earnings due to the change in the Cardinal Plan.

I spent a semester of my freshman year as one of the university’s worst telemarketers. We were — to accept the Trojan patronym — ’SCallers, and for four to eight hours a day, we called USC alumni to ask for money.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
There are scores of benefits to alumni donations besides the obvious influx of cash, and if needed I can still rattle them off enthusiastically without the help of the bullet-pointed lists we used:
Alumni donations are criteria included in our national ranking — donating can retroactively improve the value of a degree.
Given USC’s recent push to recruit bright students with merit-based scholarships, donating helps improve the caliber of each year’s graduating class.
Donations are also tax-deductible and, because of a professed wish to go green, can be processed by most major credit cards over the phone.
The list goes on.
I was a bad ’SCaller because I much preferred taking “No” for an answer than flipping through the tome-like script and explaining why even a donation of $5 helped — it was a laborious, getting-blood-out-of-a-stone process if alumni didn’t want to donate right away.
There were many points at which their answers forced me to ad lib, through which I was inadvertently introduced to a whole new dialogue of economic terminology.
It was at the ’SCallers program, for example, that I learned the meaning of “subprime mortgage crisis.”
University telemarketers across the country have felt the tightening of the money belt, which have caused donations to plummet nationwide.
The New York Times reported Wednesday that, after rising 4.1 percent a year for a decade, contributions to more than 1,000 American colleges dropped by 11.9 percent in 2009.
For public universities, donations can be the antidote for decreased government support. At private universities such as USC, donations can keep financial aid buoyant at a time when families need it most, according to The New York Times.
USC’s donations have kept fairly stable during the economic upheaval. A Council for Aid to Education poll found that USC ranked seventh highest in donations in 2009, at almost $369 million raised (we were beat out by four Ivies, Stanford and Johns Hopkins.)
Though USC alumni are weathering the storm, USC has by no means been immune to financial upset. Our endowment took a hefty hit last year — one of the largest in American universities, the Daily Trojan reported in February — dropping 25.6 percent.
During all the turmoil, university officials must decide where to allocate the money earned by each year’s donations. And though some alumni decide for the university — George Lucas wasn’t about to let his $175 million go to revamping the tennis courts — USC receives many open-ended donations.
The university has enjoyed several large gifts of late — $50 million for a new Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism building and $50 million for an endowment for cancer research. These are exciting improvements for USC, and let’s face it — anyone donating that much is going to make sure he knows where every penny is going.
At a time when USC’s current and future students are facing as much economic hardship as the university’s endowment, the best way to ensure that USC’s stature continues to grow is to invest in recruiting the best students.
More money should be going toward financial aid and merit-based scholarships. The only way to maintain a legacy of constant improvement is ensuring that the best and the brightest have the ability to join USC when the time comes.
The university’s smaller donors, who don’t designate the exact recipients of their money on forms, should think about assigning their money to scholarship funds. (As a one-time ’SCaller, I can vouch for the fact that USC does provide an easy-to-use avenue to direct personal donations.)
As for the donations that come in unassigned, USC needs to place an emphasis on scholarships at this juncture — not multi-million dollar athletic complexes or food courts.

Ms. Mueller, as managing editor for the DT, why don’t you do a story about how 2010 USC grads — particularly those from Annenburg — are doing?
When I, as a parent, got the “please give money to USC” call recently, I replied that I was not giving until my son had a job.  And since he doesn’t have one, he can’t afford to give.
Obviously the unemployment story reaches far deeper than the level of financial support for the University, but you aren’t really covering “the news” or providing undergrads an accurate picture of what it’s like “out here” until you expose this aspect of it.

Earlier this month, President C. L. Max Nikias revealed plans to construct a new student-athlete center that will expand upon the already existing USC landmark, Heritage Hall. The price tag for the addition is set at roughly $70 million; the facilities will include new locker rooms, weight rooms, larger training rooms and more study spaces for USC’s student-athletes.
News of the renovations have been met with visible excitement and eager anticipation from both Athletic Director Pat Haden and the student-athletes themselves.
Many non-student athletes, however, are less than pleased, seeing the plans for new athletic facilities as just another example of USC’s emphasis on sports above all else.
One common argument is that creating a space designed with only student-athletes in mind perpetuates the separation between athletes and non-athletes rumored to be so prevalent at USC. To many students, the athletes on campus are seen as their own impenetrable class of students,  and the construction of the center only solidifies this divide.
Moreover, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center was the university’s latest major construction project on campus, which replaced the old Commons and the Norman Topping Student Center, bestowing USC students with much-improved study spaces ranging from luxurious lounges to collaborative group rooms.
Another objection is that the facilities themselves are unnecessary. It seems as if the athletes are always given the best — the latest equipment, free tutoring, takeout boxes at the Galen Center. It is easy to be fooled by the latest Nike swag they sport, but consider that these come from an endorsement with Nike, not directly from the university’s pocketbook.
Besides, USC is a Division I school, and as such it is perhaps obligated to provide the best to its athletes — for many, this is the launching pad of their career.  A biological sciences or chemistry major would not be satisfied with archaic laboratories circa 1998 — the same year the last renovations to Heritage Hall were made.
Another major objection is that the money being allocated to this project could be better spent, specifically toward scholarships and financial aid.
It is no secret that those critical of USC often use the acronym pejoratively to denote the “University of Spoiled Children.” Shouldn’t the $70 million be spent on recruiting intelligent students from a more diverse set of socioeconomic backgrounds?
It is important to consider the sub-surface financial interactions that make structures such as the new student-athlete center possible. Ventures like this can only occur with the generous contributions of external donation — often from corporations and alumni.
It is up to the discretion of the donors where and how the money will be spent. Plans for the center were thus likely thought of years ago, and the fact that they are just now being realized — construction is set to begin January and take 18 months to complete — is merely a reflection of finally raising enough money to make plans a reality.
That USC has what Nikias calls a “legendary athletic tradition” is often a double-edged sword. On one hand, the strength of the sports teams is often an attraction to prospective students and continued alumni loyalty alike.
On the other hand — especially in light of the recent O.J. Mayo and Reggie Bush scandals — USC is often accused of taking any means necessary to procure the finest talent, even if it means jeopardizing fairness and equality. The new buildings might be seen as just another example of this favoritism.
Still, the new student-athlete center — and the lounges in particular — should be seen as a space that is open to all USC students. USC does, for example, have libraries suited to particular majors and buildings that house certain academic emphases. These new buildings are not so different.
Perhaps it is time we had a little faith in our administration; that it is in fact acting in the best interests of the institution as a whole.

The west side of campus has an unfair reputation as a shady, unsafe area. Perhaps that is why it is largely ignored by Trojans. Although Figueroa Street teems with USC students licking green and pink Yogurtland spoons, Vermont Avenue on the west of campus is forlorn and gray.
Big meals, big flavor · The eateries on Vermont Avenue feature generous portions of a wide variety of cuisines — from Chinese to Mexican — offering meals at low prices and making them perfect for students. - Photos by Sophia Lee, design by Laurel Van Patten | Daily Trojan 
That is most unfortunate because within a half-mile stretch from campus, Vermont houses several hidden gems that, despite many years of residence, have largely been passed unnoticed by students — or selfishly kept secret by others.
Start walking north on Vermont past Smart & Final and the post office, and within a 10-minute stroll you’ll find at least four eateries, all relatively close to each other. Keep your eyes peeled because they are so inconspicuous and unremarkable that you can walk pass them without noticing a thing.
The worn orange sign of Manas Indian Cuisine will be the first place you’ll come across. It is actually one of the better-known eateries in this area but still doesn’t garner the acknowledgment it deserves to be, even though it offers the best Indian grub within a mile radius of campus.
Indian cuisine is a collection of diverse ethnic and cultural tastes, and Manas offers popular dishes of various regional cuisines, from the rice and seafood-heavy South to the bread and meat-heavy North. It even includes some Indo-Chinese dishes as well as Thali dishes for those who want a platter of bites from different regions.
Depending on the dish, you get a choice of mild, medium and spicy. Unless you crunch on chili peppers as a snack, stick to the mild or medium version, as Manas is not shy with its spices. Even the medium version is searing hot if not consumed with liberal mounds of rice or bread, so order “spicy” at the risk of tears and hours of digestive relief.
Otherwise, Manas is a friendly place to explore Indian cuisine. It offers many vegetarian choices, such as palak paneer (cubes of mild cheese smothered in rich, spicy spinach gravy) and baighan bharta, a healthy Indian version of eggplant parmesan, minus the fat and cheese.
But whether you crave meat, seafood or vegetables, don’t forget the carbs — Manas serves a mean selection of hot, delicious tandoori-baked flatbreads called naan.
This leavened bread staple has an amazing texture that stays elastic and chewy even when pulled apart and drenched in rich curry, thus serving as the perfect edible utensil.
If you have a sweet tooth, you’ll love the peshawari naan, which comes stuffed with raisins, cherries, nuts and neon-pink coconut powder. If not, the simple garlic naan sprinkled with pungent minced garlic will also chase away any study blues.
Next in line is Celaya bakery on the right side of the street. Look for a tall blue sign and colorful murals in Spanish.
This 40-year-old bakery is dingy and strangely garish with bright signs and antiquated decorations, but my eyes were drawn first to the glass case in the middle of the store showcasing rows of colorful, sweet-smelling baked goods — cookies, muffins, cakelets, croissants and rolls ranging from 25 cents to $1.50.
The bakery serves a great selection of takeout meals as well. Though the menu is in Spanish, the cashiers are extremely friendly and patient when translating the menu.
But recognizing good food needs no translation. All the ingredients at Celaya are cooked and served on the spot; they even fresh chop the lettuce by hand instead of pre-shredding the vegetables and letting them sit out for hours.
Despite the freshness, the prices are dirt-cheap: Four chicken enchiladas, covered in spicy red sauce and served with salad, rice and refried beans, are only $5.50. A fat torta spilling with meat, avocado, lettuce and tomatoes is just $4.50.
Don’t forget dessert either; in addition to the pretty, baked goods, Celaya also sells a churro and hot chocolate set for $3.
Right across  the street from Celaya you’ll see another battered store with a yellow sign that reads “Olympian Burgers,” aptly named for its humongous portions.
Olympian Burgers is your classic diner with familiar American items such as pastrami melts and breakfast omelets, as well as Mexican favorites such as taquitos and fajitas.
Service is fast, friendly and efficient, and you get to see the cooks grill burgers and deep-fry potatoes right behind the counter while you wait. The quality is as fresh as diner fare can get at an affordable price; giant quarter-pound burgers range from $2.75 to $4.50, depending on the level of toppings, and a foot-long carne asada burrito, stuffed generously with smoky steak and spices, costs less than $5.
The pastrami chili cheese fries, a mouth-watering mountain of cheese, grease, meat and starch, is a meal in itself.
Hong Kong Express, less than a five-minute walk from Ralphs grocery store, also dishes up ridiculously huge portions at equally cheap prices.
It offers a special combo price for students: At $3.80, you get a hefty dollop of chow mein and fried rice, plus two additional dishes of your choice. You can also upgrade your combo with a seafood dish or additional entrée for $4.70.
As long as you don’t expect authentic Chinese cuisine, you’ll be impressed by the taste and quality of the food, which is just as good, if not better, than Panda Express. It serves up the usual American-Chinese fare such as broccoli chicken and kung pao shrimp, and it isn’t stingy about giving you a few extra pieces of tender meat or seafood.
The west side of USC might not be the most recognizable, but there is no reason why it should be shunned completely. It is time for these humble eateries to be given due credit for their years of quiet, patient servitude to the USC community.
At the very least, stop by and grab a bite for takeout — who knows, you might just become a regular.

Tony Scott’s new film, Unstoppable, is a movie worthy of success at a level equal to the film’s title, as it is, without a doubt, one of the director’s finest works.
Scott’s film pits train engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and train conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) in a dramatic race against time to stop a runaway locomotive loaded with toxic chemicals. As their dispatcher, Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), puts it, “a missile the size of the Chrysler building” is headed toward a town in Pennsylvania.
It is ultimately up to Barnes and Colson to stop the barreling behemoth as attempts from other characters in the movie — such as the blubbering corporate boss played by Kevin Dunn — are fruitless.
Scott’s setting tactfully captures the gritty aura of the film. Stanton, Pa., and the surrounding cities are portrayed as rough, blue-collar environments with looming feelings of dread. In a way, Scott’s setting is as frightening as the gray clouds that hover over the cities. The characters know that something terrible is just around the corner.
The daunting setup, along with the monstrous locomotives in the train yards, successfully laces the movie with  danger and raw power. Because of their brute force as represented by Scott, the trains become supporting characters in their own way.
Scott also manages to make the exposition-heavy setup work. Colson is dealing with a failed marriage, and his wife has filed a restraining order against him. He is troubled by the fact that he cannot see his wife or his son, and the thought of his family is constantly in the back of his mind — at times it is his main struggle in the film, arguably more so than the rogue train.
Barnes has a sub-story as well, although slightly less dour, and Scott deftly switches between the characters’ different storylines without any major distractions throughout the film. In fact, it’s done so well that he leaves the viewer wanting more when the ending credits start to roll.
Scott is able to successfully maintain the intensity of the train predicament throughout the film’s 98 minutes by using the most simple of action setups. With each scene, there’s a new danger and new characters to care about. Scott evokes all the empathetic hot spots imaginable by creating scenarios involving endangered children, animals, a local war hero and a railroad veteran.
Scott is less successful when it comes to adding humor into the film, most notably with the characters played by Lew Temple, Ethan Suplee and T.J. Miller.
Ned Oldman (Temple) seems like a redneck maverick that feels too stereotypical when coupled with more grounded characters, and Dewey and Gilleece (Suplee and Miller) are the imbecilic train yard employees that get the film’s unfortunate plot rolling — in a rather absurd way.
Oldman has a haughty attitude as the “lead welder,” and although he has some witty one-liners at the end of the movie, he more or less sticks out like a sore thumb for the entirety of the film.
When Oldman is introduced on camera, a country song plays in the background, making it seem for a brief second like the viewer was watching a country music video rather than an action movie about unmanned locomotives lurching mercilessly toward devastation.
Suplee could not have played his character better in the film; his acting is commendable, but the combination of Suplee and Miller on camera is hard to take seriously, considering they are both better known for their roles in comedies.
Dewey and Gilleece also drastically take away from the seriousness at hand as they attempt to quip while entire cities are in danger — all because of them.
For cynical viewers, Scott does a poor job of capturing reality. He seems more concerned with style and adrenaline than with realism and though this is the same man who directed Top Gun, at times this action-movie styling grows a bit unbelievable.
It seems preposterous that Barnes would be able to run across the tops of freight cars traveling at speeds of 80-plus mph. It also seems slightly unbelievable that amid all the train drama, the body count is relatively low.
But in a way, the embellishments add even more splendor to the weight of the heroic feats of Banres and Colson.
The locomotive disaster is described as potentially being the biggest tragedy in the area, yet, at the end of the film, the chase to stop the train feels extremely underwhelming.
The film was purportedly inspired by true events; it is up to the viewer to choose to believe this or think the film errs more on the side of elaboration.
Still, at the end, Scott’s film is 98 minutes of undying intensity that will leave action-lovers satisfied.
