Fred Ryan graduated from USC in 1977 with a bachelor’s of arts in speech communication and political science, and again in 1980 with a juris doctor from the Gould School of Law. Immediately after receiving his juris doctor, Ryan worked for Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign and later served as his assistant and chief of staff after Reagan left office.

Ryan is currently president and chief operating officer of POLITICO and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. Ryan and Lynn Swann, a USC alumnus and Super Bowl champion, will perform the Reagan Centennial Coin Toss at Saturday’s game in honor of what would be Reagan’s 100th birthday.
 
Daily Trojan: When did you first get involved in politics?
Fred Ryan: I first got involved in politics as a law student at USC. It was during my time as a law student that I first met Ronald Reagan. After I graduated, I decided to work on Reagan’s campaign and after he was elected, I became an assistant to the president.
 
DT: What was it like working in the White House?
Ryan: It was an incredible experience. I was only 26 years old. Although he was the oldest president, he had the youngest staff. It was an unbelievable opportunity and I learned a lot from [Reagan]. He was a genuine and likeable person and always optimistic.
 
DT: What was your most memorable moment while working at the White House?
Ryan: Reagan loved sports. He would always throw out the first pitch to start the MLB season. He would insist on throwing from the mound rather than moving up a little like most presidents do. He would always warm up in the tunnel before the pitch and I was the one who got to warm him up. He would get the ball right over the plates each time.
 
DT: What clubs were you involved with on campus?
Ryan: I was a Trojan Knight and a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. When I was a Trojan Knight we buried Traveler when he died.
 
DT: What is Reagan’s connection with USC?
Ryan: He was the first president to recognize a female sports team at the White House. When the Women of Troy won the national championship, he invited the team to the White House. When he left office and came back to Los Angeles, the USC Band was on the tarmac to greet him. The first speech Reagan gave out of office was at USC. Disney wanted him to appear in a commercial right after he left the White House saying, I am going to Disneyland, just like football teams do after they win the Superbowl, but he refused. He told the story at USC and said, “First thing I am going to do is go to USC.”
From Aztec to Trojan to Reagan and the White House…and then Politico.  An unbelievable journey and legacy.  You continue to amaze even this Bruin.
FRED RYAN IS SO COOL!!!

Imagine your first year of college if you had your posse with you. The Posse Foundation has brought this sense of friendship and community to USC for 12 freshmen students from New York City, who said this unique scholarship has helped them transition into college.
The Posse Foundation is a national organization founded in 1989 that aims to create a network of leaders from diverse backgrounds, who will not only be successful individually, but also have an impact on their university campus. A multicultural group of scholars are awarded a merit-based scholarship from each participating university where the “posse” enrolls and attend college together.
“A couple of days ago, me and one of my Posse peers pulled an all-nighter together in Leavey Library,” said Vidal Woods, a freshman and Posse Scholar majoring in international relations. “It’s great that I have someone that I already know and can turn to for support at the start of the year.”
President and founder of the Posse Foundation, Deborah Bial, began the Foundation after a student once said, “I never would have dropped out of college if I had my posse with me.”
Since then, she has promoted the importance of leadership to freshmen campuses at 38 partner colleges.
“This really is a leadership merit award allowing students as a group to come to USC and further that leadership in the classrooms and organizations on campus,” said Bial. “They bond together, but are not only diverse in race and sexuality, but interests as well.”
The students’ mentor, George J. Sanchez, vice dean for diversity and strategic initiatives, said the Posse scholarship expands upon previous USC initiatives to increase diversity.
“This will help USC in their recommitment to establishing itself as a premiere institution that can produce a generation of urban leaders of the future,” Sanchez said.
Sanchez said he is thrilled with the Posse’s progress so far and believes this diverse addition to the Trojan family will help build on programs USC has with local communities such as the Norman Topping Scholars, who are awarded academic scholarships based on merit and community involvement.
“We officially meet as a group every Friday to go over the week and discuss certain issues, such as time management,” Sanchez said. “It’s been amazing watching their progress so far -— one is an Annenberg Scholar and two others have already won national fellowships.”
Sanchez said having a group of peers from a similar background can help a student overcome adversities in college.
“They are all really in this together,” Sanchez said. “I think it really helps for the students to have such a touchstone from people they have grown up with since high school.”
Scholars have a three-step nomination process. After a being nominated by their school, students have several rounds of group and one-on-one interviews. Out of the 20 remaining candidates, university representatives and the Posse foundation select a group of 12 students.
In addition to being selected as a Posse Scholar, Matthew Fasciano, chief operating officer of Posse, said that recipients go through a pre-collegiate curriculum that helps build strong relationships between the scholars.
“It’s during that [pre-collegiate curriculum] that these young men and women really begin to learn as a cohort to develop that support network that really carries them through that college experience,” Fasciano said. “While other students may still be trying to adjust in their second year, Posse scholars have each other as a resource and are equipped in other ways to seek resources on campus.”
Woods said he likes being able to come back to his family of scholars at the end of the day.
“The fact that we have 12 of us that we can go to and talk to when we need help for homework or anything makes it easier to adjust,” said Woods. “We hang out and have dinners together often, but what really helps is that we’re all going through this together.”
Posse scholars at USC are awarded full tuition for their undergraduate education. In 2010, President Barack Obama chose the Posse Foundation as one of the 10 organizations in which he donated a part of his $1.4-million Nobel Peace Prize award money. The Posse Foundation has awarded over 3,000 scholarships to students residing in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Miami and Washington, D.C.
The students said they hope to pave the way for future “Posses” because this is the first year Posse students are enrolled at USC.
“We recognize we have a great responsibility to set the bar high by keeping our grades up and keeping a good name for the foundation,” said Woods. “The full tuition has been a great support, but the connections I’ve made with my team will have us, on graduation day, looking back on our experience as priceless.”
Rachel Jones, a Posse scholar and freshman majoring in international relations and environmental studies, said her time so far at USC has been rewarding.
”I love being a Posse scholar,” Jones said. “My experience here at USC so far has been very wonderful and I’m super excited for the years to come.”

The first All Fellows Forum, a new monthly panel series that  aims to bring graduate students together to discuss topics of shared interests with an interdisciplinary approach, was held Thursday.

About 50 students and faculty came to “New Perspectives on Islam and the Middle East,” which focused on issues related to events that have transpired in the region during the past few months.
Meredith Drake Reitan, assistant dean of graduate fellowships, said she organized the new forums to bring students in the graduate school together.
“The goal of these events is to foster a community of interdisciplinary scholars,” Reitan said. “We’re interested in new approaches and bringing students together from all over the university to think about issues from a variety of angles.”
She also said this series is a chance for the students to become more involved while giving them a “really strong push toward interdisciplinary work.”
The university has several interdisciplinary programs in place at the graduate level, and the program is designed to connect them within the university, Reitan said.
The monthly forums bring together university-funded fellows to discuss a variety of topics in a scholarly and social environment.
“I hope it is something that will last the students long after USC,” Reitan said.
Two graduate students and one professor discussed the ways they collected information about current events in the Middle East and the conclusions they drew from that research at Thursday’s forum.
Laurie Brand, USC professor of international relations, said hearing stories from people in the Middle East would help outsiders better understand their culture and that she hoped her work would propel scholars to go to other countries to do similar work.
Maytha Alhassen, a graduate student of American studies and ethnicity, said social media allows people to represent themselves publicly in a way that the media would otherwise skew.
Laila Shereen Sakr, a graduate student in the School of Cinematic Arts, said using social media, such as Twitter hashtags, is a valuable way to learn about current events from primary sources.
“[This forum] is precisely what we had in mind when we conceived of the series,” Reitan said. “The turnout was great.”

A suspect was arrested in the shooting of two USC students at an off-campus party, the Los Angeles Police Department announced Thursday.
Tyson Tiree Smith, 21, was arrested Wednesday night in the City of Signal Hill near Long Beach, Calif., LAPD Southwest Division Capt. Melissa Zak said.
Two USC students, a male undergraduate student and a female graduate student, were shot early on the morning of Sept. 4 on the 1200 block of West 37th Place after a confrontation occurred between the shooter and the victims.
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office filed two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault with a firearm against Smith, the district attorney’s office said.
LAPD and the Dept. of Public Safety used photographic and video evidence from the crime scene to identify the suspect and track him down, Zak said.
“A combination of several different sources of video were used in the investigation,” DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said. “It was a combination of technology, interviews and the whole gambit to piece together what resulted in an arrest.”
Thomas said that security cameras installed as part of a DPS security expansion west of Vermont Avenue contributed to the arrest of Smith.
“The [newly-installed] cameras played a part in [the arrest] but so did everything else,” Thomas said.
One shot was fired at the victims after a confrontation over a pair of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones escalated. The bullet hit the female student’s finger and then hit the male in the chest. The female victim performed CPR on the male victim, likely saving his life, Zak said.
“The female victim performed CPR until paramedics arrived,” Zak said. “The male victim later remembered someone breathing for him as he slipped in and out consciousness.”
Both victims were transported to California Hospital Medical Center. The female victim underwent surgery on her hand and the male victim underwent surgery on his chest. The female victim’s finger also likely saved the male victim’s life by slowing down the speed of the bullet, Zak said.
LAPD described the female victim’s actions in saving the male victim’s life as “heroic” in a press statement.
The male victim was released from the hospital Thursday and the female victim was released from the hospital early last week, Zak said.
Throughout the investigation DPS worked closely with LAPD to identify the suspect, search for evidence and interview witnesses.
“Since the incident occurred, our detectives have worked along with LAPD to assist them in this case,” Thomas said. “While LAPD is the primary investigative agency, our detectives collaborated with them and have spent every day since working on the case.”
An arraignment date has not been set, but the DA has requested bail at $1 million.
Zak said students should not host open parties.
“When someone uninvited goes to a party there can be violent, unintended consequences,” Zak said. “It is better to have closed parties where only invited guests are allowed to attend.”
 
Rachel Bracker contributed to this report. 
It so funny to me that when DPS does something “bad” in students eyes, they have 20 comments regarding the matter, but when they actually do something good as in catching a criminal THERE ARE NO COMMENTS. 
As much as people complain about their safety it seems that most of the person crimes that occur is due to the students lack of personal responsibility. Walking alone at 2am from class, leaving their computer unattended in a computer lab while you leave for 2 hours and hopes  that it will still be their when you get back, getting so drunk that you leave your friends and try and find your way home. (even though there is a tram that takes you home from 6pm-3am and cruiser that runs until 6am). Walking with your cell phone in your hands not paying attention to your surroundings. Letting people in to your party that you don’t know, getting so drunk that your passed out in someones yard. Take some responsibility for your own actions, for your own safety. 
DPS is their to ensure that we have a safe and fun 4 years of college here at USC! Their the first people that we blame when something is not going our way or we are not satisfied with a situation that we usually put ourselves into, but the first people we call for help. How about showing them a little more respect for the jobs that their doing. I want to thank them for the jobs that they are doing. And I think that you reading this should too.

The USC women’s cross-country team will begin its second meet of the 2011 season Saturday, as it is scheduled to partake in the 67th annual San Diego State Aztec Invitational, held in Balboa Park.
The course, which runs near the San Diego Zoo, should challenge the Women of Troy.
“This meet will be a great chance for the team to race on a tougher, hillier or rugged course,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “The times will be slower, but they’ll be slower for all teams. I’m trying to teach them not to be so focused on times, but rather on performance.”
With only seven entrants in this weekend’s race, USC hopes to better last week’s performance at the UC Irvine Invitational, where it finished seventh.
Redshirt junior Shelby Buckley, who opened her first season for USC as its top finisher at the invitational, will be counted upon to lead the Women of Troy to another respectable finish.  The other six runners are all the freshmen recruits, most of who raced for the first time last weekend.
The Aztec Invitational, however, will also serve as the first official race for freshman Erica Capellino, who is expected to become one of USC’s top runners.
“I’m excited to see how Erica performs,” Walsh said. “She’s been doing so well in training, and hopefully that will carry over. She’s a good hill runner, which is why we wanted her to start out in San Diego instead of last week. Kira Soderstrom will hopefully do really well too; she’s really stepped it up in training.”
The meet might prove difficult for the Women of Troy, as the terrain is notoriously rugged when compared to other 5-kilometer courses. Additionally, Walsh noted concerns about the runners going out too quickly in the early goings, which could eventually count for a loss of speed in the middle of the race. This has been a persistent issue for the Trojans in past meets, Walsh added.
Though last week’s race proved to be a solid start to the season, Walsh hopes this weekend’s invitational will allow the runners to further prove themselves. The UC Irvine Invitational was the first meet as Trojans for eight of USC’s 10 runners, and the first official collegiate race for the team’s five freshmen.
“The first race is always a starting point,” Walsh said. “Runners make mistakes and are more tentative. There’s always a big improvement between the first race and the second. We just need to focus on mental toughness, and not slowing down in the middle.”
The race, which begins at 8:30 a.m. in San Diego, will also have a community division in which local runners can participate.

USC made its final preparations Thursday for its week three matchup against Syracuse, and the UCLA colored scout team jerseys came out. Though this practice did not look much different from most mid-morning sessions, there was one key difference: scrimmaging in the red-zone.
Experience · Senior fullback Rhett Ellison understands USC needs to take advantage of every opportunity it has in the opponent’s red zone. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Rather than holding a full-field scrimmage, the Trojans opted to focus on attacking and defending inside the 20-yard line, something that senior fullback/tight end Rhett Ellison knows lacked in last week’s nail-biting win against Utah.
“Last week was just inches, a game of inches,” Ellison said. “A couple inches here and a couple inches there … This week, [we’re] just focusing on the details of stuff so we can make those big plays.”
Ellison is not worried about the state of the offense like many critics are, though.
“We’re working hard every day, so just keep that up, don’t give anything back, put it all on the practice field,” Ellison said.  “As long as guys come out with that mentality, we’ll be good … The offense, we just gotta finish. Finish plays … finish the fourth quarter.”
Ellison remains optimistic partly because of the return of senior tailback Marc Tyler, who ran for 113 yards in last week’s effort.
“We have great backs, but he’s our big back,” Ellison said. “It’s nice having a big back in there.”
—
Coming into the season, there was much speculation as to how the defense would perform this year. With two game-saving plays in the first two games — both in the fourth quarter — the unit will now face a tough test in Syracuse, but will face a bigger test in Tempe, Ariz. next week against Arizona State.
“The defense needs to keep playing awesome,” Ellison said.
—
This week during practice, USC coach Lane Kiffin has constantly stressed the team needs to worry about themselves, not about any other distractions.
“This week’s theme has been, ‘It’s all about us, it’s not about who we’re playing,’” Kiffin said. “We just want to improve and make sure that, you know, as we look at it individually, and [as] we look at the three phases of the game and as a team that we’re getting better. If we do that, then [good] things will happen.”
—
A new quarterback has been added to the roster. Junior Emon Saee is donning No. 17 in practice and is back on the team after not being on the roster during the preseason. He was also on the team last year.

After dropping two games during the Trojan Invitational at McAlister Field last weekend, the USC women’s soccer team has its most overall losses at home since 1998.
Road warriors · Junior forward Samantha Johnson and the Women of Troy have notched all three wins away from McAlister Field this season. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
Though the Women of Troy (3-5) have five losses already, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin knows USC can match up with its competition.
“We’ve played as good if not better than every team we’ve played this season,” Khosroshahin said. “No team has outplayed us for the full 90 minutes.”
Khosroshahin, however, recognizes where USC must improve.
“We gotta finish,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve created more opportunities and more scoring chances than our opponents consistently this season. Now we gotta put those chances away.”
It won’t be easy for the Women of Troy this weekend, however, as they travel to take on their third ranked opponent of the season in No. 23 Portland on Sunday. Though the Pilots (3-3-1) hold a .500 record heading into this weekend’s matchup, the team understands they are much better than the stats indicate.
“They’re a good team,” senior forward Samantha Johnson said. “We need to go up there and play the best we can possibly play in every aspect of the game.”
Pilots’ forward Danielle Foxhoven leads Portland with five of the team’s six goals this season, while a rotation of three goalies that include Hailee DeYoung, Erin Dees and Nicole Downing have held opponents to just eight goals scored in seven games.
After playing Friday and Sunday for the first couple weeks of the season, the Women of Troy will have Friday off for the first time — and the team says the one-game weekend gives them a great chance to rest up.
“It’s been a grind,” Johnson said. “We’ve been in some really tense games. It’s great to rest up our bodies.”
Khosroshahin saw the extra off day as a chance to get a different type of rest.
“We’ve been struggling mentally,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s great for us to get a bit of a break and get a little extra practice in before this trip.”
This weekend is USC’s last before Pac-12 play begins. Khosroshahin often says he divides the season into three stages: non-conference, conference and tournament. Each one, he says, prepares his team for the next. And after what has been a disappointing non-conference portion of the season, the Women of Troy are eager to head into the Pac-12 on an upswing.
“It’s our last chance,” Khosroshahin said. “We know it’s not gonna get any easier in conference.”
As has been the case all season, Khosroshahin is focused on his team — regardless of the opponent.
“We know that if we play up to our potential, we can match up with anyone,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve just gotta put the ball in the back of the net.”
Let’s do it SC women’s soccer! Go to Portland and win, win, win!

Last season at this time, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team was an unknown, brimming with talent but overloaded with untested youth, needing an opportunity to prove it had arrived as a serious national title competitor.
Chasing history · With 655 career saves, senior goalie Joel Dennerley is 20 saves away from the No. 1 spot on USC’s all-time career list. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The 2010 NorCal tournament served as that platform. In three straight days, the Trojans (2-0) defeated then-No. 1 California, No. 2 UCLA and No. 5 UC Irvine en route to earning the tournament title.
Entering the NorCal tournament at the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., this weekend, there are no outstanding questions that need to be answered.
“We’re looking really good,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “There are certain games where our offense has looked excellent. It’s early in the season, where most of our guys are returning, so we are a really confident group right now.”
In the semifinal contest against Cal last season, the Trojans cruised into halftime with an 8-4 lead, but almost relinquished that advantage in the second half before surviving with a 12-11 victory, in large part because of current senior goalie Joel Dennerley’s exploits. The championship match against No. 2 UCLA was almost a repeat of the semifinal match, with current senior driver Peter Kurzeka burying his third and decisive goal of the game with seconds left to elevate the Trojans past the Bruins, 11-10.
Strategically, Vavic believes his team’s performance in odd-man situations this weekend will determine whether the Trojans can notch another NorCal tournament title.
“We’ve been focusing on extra-man and down-man situations, because usually when you go in a tough tournament, how you perform in those types of situations decides who wins,” Vavic said. “We have some things to work on in the next couple of days, but our work so far has been encouraging.”
Aside from the addition of freshman driver Konstantinos Genidounias, who debuted for the Trojans last week after competing in the FINA Men’s Junior World Championships, the Trojans will bring, for all intents and purposes, the same squad as last year.
“We’re really only taking up one new player to NorCal, and that’s [Genidounias],” Vavic said. “He has proven that he’s a really talented player, so I think he’s going to get a lot of playing time.”
USC will face West Valley Junior College — the No. 16 seed — in its first matchup Saturday at 8 a.m. A win will likely pit the Trojans against No. 6 UC Irvine at 2:40 p.m. From there, USC would advance to the semifinals to play either No. 5 Pacific or No. 4 Stanford.
“After those first two rounds, it’s going to be Stanford and Pacific,” Vavic said. “Pacific is a much-improved team. They’re good in every area. They have a strong two-meter man, they have a good lefty outside shooter, they have a good goalie, so I think the game between those two is going to be really close, especially since it’s at Pacific.”
If the Trojans advance past the semi-final round, No. 2 Cal or No. 3 UCLA likely awaits.
“Regardless of whom we see in the second or third round, it’s going to be challenging, and nothing is given when you’re playing so many good teams,” Vavic said.

Just minutes after stepping to the podium following Saturday’s 23-14 victory
over Utah, USC coach Lane Kiffin was confronted with a reporter’s question regarding the “controversial” on-field interview he gave a week earlier, in which he said USC only had two good players on offense.
The question had nothing to do with the outcome of the Trojans’ most recent game, nor was it related to any storylines leading up to tomorrow’s showdown with Syracuse. Yet not a single person batted an eye in the crowded L.A. Coliseum media room, because after all, we’ve come to accept the subtle vilification of Kiffin, even if it comes without logic or reason.
Kiffin’s well-documented past will never be erased, as it remains an essential part of his coaching narrative.
His brief stint in Knoxville, Tenn., was highlighted by brash guarantees, off-the-cuff remarks and childish behavior unbefitting of a college football head coach.
But presently, it’s clear to anyone who has truly followed his cross-country journey to Los Angeles that he is not that same guy he was two years ago.
Though he continues to praise senior tailback Marc Tyler for his redemption story, the true Hollywood transformation lies within the coach himself.
Not too long ago he was the crass, entitled punk of the SEC, whose naivety showed through in endless ESPN reels and Internet videos.
These days, he is a shell of his former self.
Kiffin 2.0 is a man methodical in his delivery, carefully crafting every noun, verb and adjective, so that it comes off with a sense of class and genuine humility. Call it manufactured if you like; I’d prefer mature.
It’s funny that media and fans alike continue to overlook his growth as a coach, simply because that story isn’t eye-grabbing or sexy nowadays.
As the football coach at a prestigious university like USC, there should be no sense of accomplishment for the mere fact that he can now respectfully handle media obligations.
But taking into consideration what he stepped into and where he came from, his progress, from a communication standpoint, should not go unnoticed.
Granted, he will never charm the pants off of fans or fill up a post-practice press conference with a quote book full of sound bites like his predecessor.
If you are looking for a grand motivator, one who can yell and scream in the locker room only to come out all smiles for the media, the introverted Kiffin will never be that guy.
It’s time we stop trying to mold him into that kind of figure.
Sure, he signed up for the microscopic knit-picking that goes on with every move he makes, whether its on a two-point conversion or on what color visor to wear.
Sure, regardless of the scrutiny he faces, Kiffin will still admit this is his ultimate dream job.
Yet, why does it feel like we are all so intent on turning his dream into a living nightmare every time he veers from the pristine coaching model?
It’s often the media’s job to find the most interesting angle on a story, even if to the naked eye that angle doesn’t appear to exist.
It’s that magical element that sells stories and promotes websites to Trojan supporters who clamor with baited breath at even the slightest bit of behind-the-scenes scoop.
But what if that angle truly doesn’t exist when it comes to the portrayal of Kiffin?
Maybe he is truly content this time around showering the media with bland commentary and straight-forward responses instead of the air of confidence he so readily displayed at Tennessee.
This approach might not sell T-shirts or make airwaves, but he didn’t come to USC to serve as a central fodder figure for beat writers and talking heads alike — he came to coach.
Kiffin’s newfound persona makes him an easy target when he does misstep from time to time, but it takes an awful lot to ignore the typical cat-and-mouse antics coaches and reporters so often play with one another.
“Usually the people writing the negative stuff don’t know me at all,” Kiffin said in a recent interview with ESPN.com. “I think people that don’t know me, it’s almost like they don’t believe I’m human.”
Though I have never broken bread or shared a heartfelt conversation with the man, I can confirm he is in fact human.
My only hope is that we all can start to treat him as such.

Great piece.
I am not sure why people (including those on message boards like uscfootball.com) hate him so much. Is it because of:
1. The apocryphal story that he forced out Norm Chow?
2. The 4th and 2 call against Texas?
3. His departure for the NFL?
4. His stint at Tennessee where he said some things to attract attention to the program?
5. The fact that he left TN for USC, his dream job?
6. The appearance that he is a spoiled entitled kid?
Why do people admire Jim Hairball for what he said at stanfurd? Kiffin did the same thing to try to resurrect a TN program that was down a little bit. It’s OK for Hairball to bash Pete Carroll, but not OK for Kiffin to challenge Pope Urban Meyer?
Suppose for a second Kiffin is a spoiled kid who got everything handed to him.  Would he be the first in this country to advance because of nepotism? Who are the USC “fans” who would despise him simply for this regardless of what talent he may have?
These Internet fans need to start supporting the program, from the AD down to the walk-on kicker.
When Carroll left in a hurry, who did they think we were going to get to replace him? I think we are lucky to have him and the assistants he brought with him.

After two straight weeks of nail-biting finishes, USC remains hopeful it can cure some of its early season offensive woes.
Tough task · USC sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey (pictured center), along with the rest of the USC secondary, will be challenged Saturday against Syracuse’s quarterback Ryan Nassib, who has thrown for 496 yards and six touchdowns through two games this season. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
“A lot of drives have come down to freshmen mistakes,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of an offense that ranks 91st nationally in points per game. “Hopefully we are getting more experience and we won’t make those mistakes down the road.”
Scoring just 19 and 23 points against Minnesota and Utah respectively, the Trojans (2-0) host Syracuse on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the first time since 1990 — marking their second nonconference game of the season.
Similarly, the Orange is off to a 2-0 start following wins over Wake Forest and Football Championship Subdivision foe Rhode Island. As with USC, it has needed plays in the final moments to avoid defeat, winning by just a touchdown in both contests.
Last season the Syracuse defense ranked 17th nationally, and with experience at quarterback in senior Ryan Nassib, Saturday could in fact be another nail-biter.
“On offense, they have a really good passing quarterback,” Kiffin said. “He’s [completing] over 80 percent in the second half of games. Anytime you have a quarterback that is playing extremely well that is experienced as your opponent, you better be ready to go.”
Nassib, who currently ranks within Syracuse’s top-10 in passing yards, touchdown passes and  completions, has put his skill set on display thus far this season.
Through two games, Nassib has completed 49-of-65 passes for 496 yards, six touchdowns and one interception. The fourth-year signal caller, though, has had plenty of help, as senior wide receiver Van Chew has already hauled in 12 catches for 194 yards and two touchdowns. Fellow receiver junior Alec Lemon has added 17 receptions of his own for 146 yards and one touchdown. Senior running back Antwon Bailey has also stabilized the Orange ground game with 38 carries for 157 yards and two touchdowns.
Facing an experienced offensive attack, USC’s defense, will feature several new faces this week in as it was announced redshirt freshman cornerback Anthony Brown and junior safety Drew McAllister will receive playing time Saturday.
“It has been the same the past two weeks, Brown said. “This week I’m really excited because I get a chance to play. I’m really fired up.”
McAllister will play in the third or fourth series against Syracuse, Kiffin said.
After two close games at home, the Trojans are looking to finish games strong and maintain the energy from the first half.
“We need to be ready for whatever they throw at us,” sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods said. “They play a lot of press. We just got to be ready for quick releases and explosive plays.”
In addition, USC is committed to ball control, especially in the fourth quarter.
“We have gotten conservative in the fourth quarter. Conservative doesn’t mean we can’t make first downs,” Kiffin said. “Conservative means that you’re trying not to turn the ball over and not give the game away.”
Following standout performances recently by junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil, USC has a powerful weapon on offense. Kalil, who is a 6-foot-7, blocked a field goal last week against Utah in the conference opener. Kiffin credits Kalil’s success to his dedication to the game.
“Once in a while you’ll have tall guys but it still takes great effort and what he‘s put into it,” Kiffin said. “He was putting the same effort into practice as he was in the game. That’s why he is doing so well at it.”
The Trojans will strive to utilize both their running and passing game. With an arsenal of talent at running back including senior tailback Marc Tyler and strong wide receivers like Robert Woods, the Trojan offense is primed to take on a more balanced offensive game.
“As an offense, you got to get that steady run pass rhythm. Turnovers have killed it,” Kalil said. “As an offense, once you get that rhythm going with the run, pass, play action and all that; it’s a lot easier to score and close out games.”
USC hopes to capitalize on improvements made in practice and earn their third consecutive win.
Kickoff is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. and will be televised on FX.

My biracial identity has allowed me to have the unique experience of hearing about the two vastly different worlds my parents were born in. My mother grew up literally in the jungles of El Salvador, while my father grew up in the developed country of Canada.
You can imagine my mother’s story was slightly darker than my father’s. He transitioned into American society with relative ease as a white, middle-class male upon immigration, while my mother struggled in poverty in El Salvador.
Now, 30 years after my mother immigrated, there are 6.1 million Hispanics under the age of 18 living below the poverty level in the United States.
These are facts that don’t surprise us. But it’s not all bad news: In 2010, college enrollment among Hispanics rose by 24 percent, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. This is indeed monumental. This increased enrollment is an indication of the success of affirmative action; as the poverty level plummets, affirmative action still provides opportunities for students to attend college.
The state of Michigan is currently involved in a decision to reinstate the ban on affirmative action, which was struck down in July 2011. The simple reason Michigan should  maintain the 2011 ruling is that affirmative action diversifies college campuses and assists disadvantaged students in moving up from their socioeconomic statuses.
Preventing a college from ensuring diversity comes at the expense of every student admitted.
Affirmative action has been successful in diversifying colleges across the nation, and it has been since its enactment because of its stipulation to admit people from various racial backgrounds.
And when colleges are diverse, students are exposed to a variety of cultures that expand their knowledge about the world while eradicating ignorance and racial prejudice. Walls break down when students have equal opportunity to perform well in classrooms.
When this opportunity for diversity is unavailable, all students are affected and are at a disadvantage. Compare this to a school like USC, which is a haven for a diverse array of students, I can personally attest to feeling more cultured as a result of being a student here. Additionally, studies have shown that campus diversity positively affects students as it improves their relationships on campus, according to a study done by DiversityWeb.org.
The least we can do after years of discriminating against minorities is take into consideration their often disadvantaged backgrounds and become more sympathetic to their situations while providing them with the means to achieve.
Minority students are at a disadvantage because of a number of reasons: social class, school location and average income, among others.
Affirmative action has proven to help students rise up socially and fiscally. For example, in 1996, the installment of affirmative action helped 5 million minority members move up in the workforce. Since then, the numbers have grown — and it’s a good thing they have because statistically, before a minority child even leaves the delivery room, he or she has a 32.3 percent chance of dropping out of high school. Compare that with Asians — 89.4 percent chance of graduating — and white students — 83.4 percent chance of graduating — and the gap is significant.
Efforts to uphold affirmative action can continue to close the gap in this nation, and that’s what most opponents fail to realize. Affirmative action isn’t meant to segregate; it’s meant to diversify and help disadvantaged students.

Well there are no JUNGLES in El Salvador, but I agree with your comments on Minority struggle in this country, one of my good friends  is hispanic and even though she is now a Nurse she had to go trough diffcult times to get accepted into nursing school 7 years ago. nd while in school she was always descriminated . she was always in a disadvantage . . good article .
I Agree with you article. We need to accept minority as a whole . Hispanics work very hard  to get good education, and am sure that if they  had the funds to go to good schools they would. good article .
Could you link to the point article on these, please.

In a major victory for opponents of affirmative action, a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals last Friday declared a measure that allows the consideration of race in Michigan’s public college admissions unconstitutional, thus beginning the process of reinstating a prior ban against affirmative action for applicants to public universities.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Many proponents of affirmative action will claim that the judicial ruling is a step back for American diversity and race relations. Such a claim is far from the truth.
Californians have also faced the same issue. With Proposition 209, California voters passed a ban against affirmative action in 1996, which made it illegal to give preferential treatment to women and minorities in public university admissions, contracting and hiring for government jobs.
California Gov. Jerry Brown voiced his support for repealing the ban on July 8, when he questioned the constutionality of the state’s ban on affirmative action in college admissions to public universities.
The bans are promising, but an omnipresent drive for political correctness and Brown threatens the progress California has made toward real equality in the public university system.
Affirmative action is a form of artificial equality — a numbers game which has disguised itself as a method to keep schools diverse and equal. Applicants to public universities should be admitted based on qualifications instead of skin color.
America has always proudly projected an image of an enlightened meritocracy, of a nation where people can advance themselves based on achievement. A return to pro-affirmative action policy in California, however, would do more harm to this already tarnished image, in turn bringing reverse discrimination back in full force.
If a university were to reject a qualified minority student because of his or her skin color, the public would be up in arms. But if it did the same to a white student, it would be called affirmative action and an advancement of diversity and equality.
California and the nation should continue to move away from the damaging mindset supported by affirmative action. In eliminating race from the college admissions process, universities ensure a new generation of hard-working students will positively contribute to society regardless of their race.
Public education, particularly higher education, is one of the state’s most influential means of producing good citizens. It can be just as influential in the promotion of a negative authority of racism masked by the deceptive nature of affirmative action in the admissions process.
Some believe that a causation between race and poverty exists; this belief should not be used to reward or punish people without considering their merits and contributions on a deeper, intellectual level.
This state-sponsored racism should continue to be banned. As a society, we should reward merit rather than look at admissions categorically using demographics.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays.
WHY does the California legislature want to know my skin color? Why do UC administrators want to judge me based on the color of my skin, rather than the content of my character? Why to liberals hate MLK, Jr.’s dream so much?
If you make an assumption about a person based solely on their skin color — as admissions offices always do — you are engaging in racism and promoting stereotypes.
There are many complexities associated with affirmative action programs and policies.  However, one issue which we continually ignore, as is the case with most government related programs and initiatives, is whether it is effective in addressing past wrongs.  Think about this:  How many beneficiaries of affirmative action programs have actually shared their good fortune with other members of their particular ethnic group, as opposed to using their increased opportunities and wealth to distance themselves from the masses of minority citizens?
The “past wrongs” argument is completely bogus, of course. A Latino who just waltzed across the border a few years ago gets bonus points, although he obviously has no connection to American society whatsoever. Same for any immigrant — yet if the immigrant is the right color, he gets bonus points for a “past wrong” with which he is not remotely associated.
Sarah,
 How about for the men and women of Troy asking the federal government to deny public levy tax money to
‘ SC for practicing alumni legacy preferences, preferences for the children of the wealthy and famous,children of professors and administrators, geographical preferences, preferences for athletic admits for the swim,golf,tennis and volleyball teams of ‘SC etc. ? Public levy tax money means money for student loans and research among other things. All the above mentioned preferences are the same evil Geminid twins  of race preferences. All of the above named preferences are illegal, vile ,sick and demented just like race preferences.’SC is not a non-[rofit organization.
It is a business like Starbucks or Mcdonald. I hit a raw nerve did I not? A tax exemption from the IRS is most certainly not in order.
Sure! We should definitely get rid of legacy admits. Sports is a more complicated measure, because at least there, people are being judged on their athletic merit.
But do you really want an admissions board treating people differently based solely on racial reasons?
Sarah:  Race will become the subset of the selection process for law school based on need for the under-represented.   The DOJ, ABA, The DoE (including the Section of Legal Education) The US and Texas Attorney General Offices all have the matrix (non-bias) in resolving the selection process for law school as mandated by the Grutter decision. Case no# DJ 169-73-0 dated April 5th 2005. Articles in print:  Rough Ride for Law School Accreditor (Inside Higher Ed) and Fixing Law School Admissions (Wesleyan University/Argus Paper).  Google and click on web for both articles. 
What the courts need to instruct us on is: Can race be utilized within the selection process ??   Once the matrix is modified to include or not to include race for the law school selection process, we can then build the matrix for the Undergrad, MBA, Medical and other educational platforms should we/they wish to do so. In-short, we must ensure that no one is left out of the admissions process and as just as important, the applicant can do the work once they are offered a seat within the universities (at any level of education) ensuring academic performance and graduation.  
Note: Prof Sanders of UCLA outstanding research on analysis of the LSAT test score and the Law School Admissions Council/Services (LSAS/LSAC) analysis on the adjusted GPA for all law applicants in respects to their Class Room Academic potential…….
Once the process is defined (Race or not to Race), the matrix will be re-built triggering admissions on supply and demand for law school which will permit proper funding for the law grads and employment (with pay) ensuring the repayment of loans.  Each educational platform has its own unique characters for selection.  They too will be built into the matrix, should we (this nation) choose to do so……..         
As for contracts and hiring, No judge is willing to implement AA. The process nor the actual triggers for contracts and/or hiring can be inforced……
Ultimately, while racism — even “the subtle racism of lowered expectations” — still exists, affirmative action must exist. It is far from the ideal, but we do not live in an ideal world. Hopefully, given 50 years, the American higher education system will have progressed. For now, we take baby steps.
The “subtle racism of lowered expectations?” – from whom? Who would be the arbiter on whether or not this is occurring? Would we have a ‘subtle racism investigation panel’ or inspector general?’ If so, how would these investigators be picked? What would be their qualifications? Who would pay for it all? It’s a hot mess. Give it up.  
Forced correctness doesn’t work unless one has a very bright and clear line. Using “I know it when I see it” rationale and wishy washy arguments on idealism doesn’t work either. 
You’re arguing for an ideal that cannot exist. There will always be racism and facism – as a society we must work to reject it, but “rewarding” groups against whom sleights have been committed is messy, messy work and causes more problems and sleights than it’s worth.
Re: “racism still exists.”
Yeah, it’s being institutionalized by race-obsessed legislators and admissions boards.
There are many minority students that work hard in order to attend universities but are not accepted because their public schools do not provide them with the same opportunities and advisement they need in order to be an applicant equal to someone from a high-achieving public or private school. I think that today, in 2011, this has definitely become more of an economic issue, but we cannot ignore the fact that many of those who come from low-income backgrounds and attend low-performing schools are minorities. Although I wish race were not a factor in college admission, without affirmative action our universities would be dominated by those with “privileged” backgrounds and would lack the diversity needed to create the best learning environment possible. Instead of attacking affirmative action, we should investigate primary and secondary education to see how we can provide all students with better opportunities so that when they do apply to college all students can be at a similar starting line.
Lindsay,
You have made an excellent argument for diversification of admissions based on geographic locations of primary schooling.  Giving someone preferential treatment based on the color of their skin remains immoral.
Well said Sarah. I completely agree with you.

Dad won’t see a romantic comedy, Mom refuses to watch a Jackass-inspired flick and the teenager won’t sit still for a mystery film. What is the nuclear family to do? Many this weekend will compromise with Drive, the new action flick starring Ryan Gosling as a stunt driver who earns pocket money through crime.
The film already picked up an award at the Cannes Film Festival, but many people just care about the car chases. In a few months, that same family may also compromise with The Three Musketeers, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows or the new Mission: Impossible — all promising action movies with something everyone can enjoy.
Action movies often fall into two categories: brainless spectacles of explosions with tepid plots hardly worth the popcorn and truly pulse-pounding films that get the adrenaline rushing in ladies and gents alike.
Neither type tends to charm the Academy, but a good action film is still a cathartic afternoon jaunt. A narrow gap exists between an awesome action flick and a horrible one, but where exactly is the fault line?
Let’s look at Fast Five, Kill Bill, Die Hard and Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark. These films, completely different in style, all received box office and critical acclaim as furious action flicks.
Fast Five likely won’t become a hallmark of action cinema, but it redeemed the flagging franchise and gave girls and guys alike something to ogle. While the serviceable screenplay comes up a tad short, the classic heist plot is well-served by the car chases and constant energy.
Most expected the film to drag the series further into its hackneyed depths. Instead, it scored a respectable 78 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, a site that gives an aggregate rating based on film reviews from multiple critics. What alchemy did Fast Five’s director Justin Lin perform to turn a potentially lackluster waste of money into a fine summer kickoff? He did enough — just enough plot and just enough characters. That way, the film could focus on why people see action films in the first place — entertainment.
A good plot for an action film is not the same as a good plot for mystery. It must be interesting but not too complex, lest the plot get tangled in its own tortuous threads. Take Quentin Tarentino’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2: Despite the wonky chronology and flashy dialogue, the story is still just a woman’s roaring rampage against the people who did her dirt.
Think back also to 1988’s Die Hard, a story that starts with detective John McClane locked in the same building as a terrorist. The ass-kicking promptly commences in all of its bloody glory.
A simple but effective plot allows for more stylistic creativity and smaller details. Adding more time for complicated triple-crosses, red herrings and crazy revelations may make a great David Fincher film, but in Kill Bill or Die Hard these would just take away from The Bride and McClane busting faces, which is the film’s main draw.
Die Hard and Kill Bill also sport strong characters, but they are not all that complex. Once again, bold strokes speak louder than subtle ones. Forged by the superteam of Steven Spielberg and pre-Star Wars prequels George Lucas, Raiders of the Lost Ark gives audiences one such character in the fearless adventurer Indiana Jones. He’s larger than life and full of snark, but most of his rugged charm and nuance comes from Harrison Ford’s own skills. It’s easy to root for Indiana as he shoots Nazis and dodges boulders, and that’s not a bad thing.
Yet there can’t be a hero without a badass nemesis to fight. No one forgets Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, who matched every ounce of McClane’s heroism with charismatic villainy. The quirky villains in Kill Bill made the film, from Lucy Liu as a Yakuza warrioress to Michael Madsen as a trailer-park assassin. Each has a backstory but is told in glimmers and one-liners, not drawn-out conflicts that mesh poorly with SWAT raids or Nazi attacks.
Finally, a good action film has style — that glittering quality that makes its explosions and gunfights different than those of every other film. Tarantino used Western and martial-arts films as an inspiring motif. Indiana Jones brought in archaeology, adventure and whips. In Fast Five, Lin used precise stunts and camera tricks to make his car chases and standoffs spark twice as much as its predecessor.
Drive, too, looks to potentially be an action film that uses its car stunts and explosions as a thrill ride. Action flicks might not sweep the Oscars, but that does not mean they haven’t swept us away. Films are supposed to entertain and sometimes nothing does that better than a gun battle. If looming midterms and finals are begging for a catharsis, check out a few potentially gifted action flicks in the near future: The Three Musketeers, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Mission: Impossible IV.

When most people go to musical theatre, they expect frothy tunes, fluffy comedy and songs of hope and love. This is not the case with John Kander and Fred Ebb’s 1966 Cabaret, the newest production by the Reprise Theatre Company. From the first curtain to the last, the show swings between young love, hopeless love, hypocrisy, loss and the rise of the Nazi party.
Show stoppers · Dodge’s interpretation of Cabaret is entertaining and enthralling, but it is the cast that truly makes the show with intriguing backstories and independent and self-fulfilling roles. - Photo courtesy of Ed Krieger
As a musical, Cabaret walks a fine line between telling a story and becoming lost in its own metaphor. This production, however, tips its hat to historical authenticity to create a show that’s moving, salacious and chillingly human.
The show begins with the tuxedo-clad Master of Ceremonies (Bryce Ryness) welcoming the audience to 1930s Berlin and to the Kit Kat Klub, a kinky cabaret where those not crippled by Germany’s depression come to enjoy drinks, boys and girls — often simultaneously.
American novelist Cliff Bradshaw soon arives (Jeff McLean), looking for artistic inspiration. What he finds is Sally Bowles (Lisa O’Hare), a decadent stage kitten with delusions of grandeur.
The two become roommates under the roof of world-weary, scrappy spinster Fräulein Schneider (Mary Gordon Murray) and neighbors to the pragmatic call-girl Fräulein Kost (Katrina Lenk). Fräulein Schneider has her own budding romance with the gentle Jewish fruit vendor Herr Shultz (Robert Picardo), who lavishes her with pineapples and schnapps.
It seems like a happy, dysfunctional family. Except it’s also the rise of Nazi Germany and things are quickly going to hell in a hand basket.
One might complain the Kit Kat Klub looks too pretty. After all, 1930s Germany was in a staggering depression and entertainment was cheap and tacky, as the Broadway revival suggested. However, Berlin always had people with money — some people who even saw a looming crisis and eagerly spent money on lavish entertainment while they still could.
The Kit Kat Club’s glittering set pieces and stylish dance numbers reflect this higher clientele. Instead of gyrating to jaunty tunes, the dancers spin a wicked Charleston, sometimes while locked in a passionate kiss.
Director and choreographer Marcia Milgrom Dodge, who earned seven Tony nominations for Ragtime in 2010, makes Cabaret a world rather than a stage piece. Her songs are big and glitzy, from the opening “Wilkommen” to hilariously tawdry “Two Ladies.”
Dodge crafts a great blueprint but it’s the cast that brings the story to life. McClean’s Cliff is a strikingly innocent boy — he’s idealistic, tender, a tad mischievous and a bit of a dork. When he starts to realize the darkness of the world around him he holds nothing back. His helpless rage is heartbreaking.
Meanwhile, O’Hare’s Sally is ridiculous and charming by turns. Sally appears to live off gin and dancing but as the show goes on it seems her cocktails and fur coat are the only things between her and a complete breakdown. Her titular song “Cabaret” is a desperate cry to decadence and embraced destruction.
The Emcee plays a dozen roles including a performer, a host and a Puckish commentator. Ryness shines in all of them.
The Emcee is clownish and sinister all at once. His big number “Money Money” is a sarcastic celebration of capitalism as the ensemble swings giant money bags. His softer “I Don’t Care Much” harkens to the cold disillusionment felt both by Sally and the downtrodden people of the Weimar Republic — the ones who would later stand by as Nazis shipped off their Jewish neighbors to concentration camps. Yet unlike in some productions, he remains very much a real character, as seen during “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” when he bemusedly walks in on a future Nazi anthem song.
Rounding out the strong cast is the ensemble — watch closely and one sees each is a main character the spotlight only glances upon.
The production does not give into the siren song of the Nazi motif. Instead of losing itself in Nazi regalia, this production remains loyal to its characters. Ultimately it’s their stories. The show uses brilliant little touches, such as the Emcee walking around in a casual robe one morning, to remind us that the characters exist for themselves, not just pieces in an anti-fascist metaphor.
But when the Nazism impacts the story, it’s shocking and cruel. Here the Nazis are not nameless boogeymen but people who see themselves as the builders of a new Germany — as well as an ensemble one has grown attached to. When Cliff’s charismatic German friend suddenly sports a swastika, it’s a punch to the gut.
Theatre exists to entertain but it can also be a harbinger of social commentary. A loaded political climate can exist in any era, including now. The Reprise Theatre’s production of Cabaret is flashy and funny, but it is also powerful and sardonic. At the very least it feels authentic and that always makes for compelling stagecraft.
 
The Reprise Theatre Company’s production of Cabaret plays at UCLA’s Freud Playhouse through Sept. 25. Tickets can be purchased from the UCLA Central Ticket Office by calling (310) 825-2101.

The Los Angeles Police Department announced Thursday afternoon the arrest of the suspect involved in the shooting of two USC students at an off-campus party Sept. 4.
Tyson Tiree Smith, 21, was arrested Wednesday night in Signal Hill in Long Beach, Calif., LAPD Southwest Division Capt. Melissa Zak said.
The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office filled two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault with a firearm against Smith, the district attorney’s office said.
Two USC students, a male undergraduate student and a female graduate student, were shot early on the morning of Sept. 4 on the 1200 block of West 37th Place after a confrontation allegedly occurred between Smith and the victims.
LAPD and DPS used photographic and video evidence from the crime scene to identify the suspect and track him down, Zak said.
One shot was fired at the victims. The bullet hit the female student’s finger and then hit the male in the chest. The female victim performed CPR on the male victim likely saving his life, Zak said.
Both victims were transported to California Hospital Medical Center. The female victim underwent surgery on her hand and the male victim underwent surgery on his chest. The female’s finger also likely saved the male victim’s life by slowing down the trajectory of the bullet, Zak said.
The male victim was released from the hospital today and the female victim was released from the hospital early last week. Zak said.
Rachel Bracker contributed to this report.
Yay!  Hopefully they convict him if he really was the shooter!

Through the shadow of the 9/11 anniversary, the lights along Lincoln Center in New York City are shining on a flourish of designers, models and Hollywood’s elite as New York Fashion Week sets the stage for next season’s trends. From buttercup-printed ball gowns at Oscar de la Renta to Indian-influenced pieces at Thakoon, next spring is already looking bright.

Oscar de la Renta:
This show opened with bright ball gowns paired with lace tops and worked its way into sleek and structured dresses in white lace. Tailored pieces in yellow, blue, neutrals and red hit the runway to offer looks worthy of both elite corporate offices and cocktail parties. The collection went back in time with flirty flapper-inspired dresses, and closed with fairytale-like ball gowns in cobalt blue and buttercup prints.

Diane Von Furstenberg:
This Belgian native waxed patriotic at the end of her show by distributing American flags to attendees, but fanfare was preceded by a bubbly collection of voluminous dresses with African-influenced prints.

Marc  By Marc Jacobs:
True to form, this line kept a simple aesthetic that matched geometric shapes with clean lines.  With soft jade greens, blues and reds, this collection boldly takes on the vibrant colors of spring, while keeping structure minimal. Also presented were looks with bold, yet simple, graphics to add a lightness to the cleanness of other pieces shown.

Vera Wang:
This show opened with crisp looks in a refreshing sheer white. Mini-dresses and shorts with peplum hemlines first took the stage, as colorful graphic fabrics quietly snuck into the collection. Ornately folded minis were next on the scene in yellow, gray and pink; the show ended in gowns in a vibrant cobalt blue.

This ‘Horror’ film was anything but frightening. If you were looking for a scary movie, you would probably have more luck watching a movie from the Scary Movie franchise. It’s surprising that a film studio even bought this extremely low-budget film.
Creature follows a group of friends on a road trip to New Orleans who decide to take a shortcut through Louisiana’s bayou country. While at a convenience store in the middle of nowhere, the clerks inform the group of a legend about a man-turned-alligator creature that now dwells in the swamps.
Of course, the group thinks the store clerks are full of it, so they investigate for themselves. And, as expected, their trip is disturbed when the creatures finds them in the midst of their midnight toke and booze session in the woods. Horror films don’t get much more predictable than this.
The incest between a brother and sister is never explained, nor why the store clerk beats his son and rapes his daughter —who are the incestuous brother and sister.
The film appears to be so low budget that the props seem to be right out of a House of Humor store, and the sound effects from iMovie. The absence of fear is so strong that viewers almost can’t help but laugh at the film’s series of events. The actors don’t appear to have too much acting experience, either, which is likely another cause of the roaring laughs the audience was projecting.

A U.S. soldier from Columbia, KY. will receive a Medal of Honor for saving 36 soldiers while on duty in Afghanistan; he will be first Marine since the Vietnam War to be awarded the military’s highest decoration.
Dakota Meyer, 23, requested a beer with President Barack Obama on Wednesday before his ceremony Thursday. The two were photographed on the Oval Office patio while drinking mugs of ale.
Meyer had been serving in Afghanistan on Sept. 8, 2009 when his troops and other Afghan soldiers came under attack from Taliban fire.
Defying supervisors’ orders, Meyer made several trips into the war zone and saved 13 Americans and 23 Afghans. He also recovered the bodies of four Americans who were killed in action.

Undeniably, we live in a generation of movie adaptations. It seems as if a majority of movies nowadays are “based on the bestseller” or “inspired by a true story.” Even more films are a part of the burgeoning trend of remakes, such as Conan the Barbarian and Fright Night.
But having these phrases stamped onto a movie poster doesn’t mean the movie is necessarily going to be “bad” solely because it is not the original.   With the upcoming Farelly Brothers reboot of The Three Stooges — starring Sean Hayes of Will and Grace fame as Larry, MADtv cast member Will Sasso as Curly and Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe — there is quite the fervor over  fidelity to the classic slapstick trio’s legacy.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film will take on a modern day twist as Curly, Moe and Larry circumstantially find themselves on a reality TV show.   One fan notes on the film’s IMDb webpage, “I know it’s going to suck (or not be very good)! … Even if the impersonations were all that good, nothing can replace the Stooges!”
Comments like this reflect our tendency to reject an adaptation before it’s even seen due to the sentimentality surrounding the primary source.   Modern day adaptations should be looked upon more as versions of a story. This by no means requires that we ignore the original material. Rather, we should accept the original as an influence upon the newer film and take that film as a single chapter in the vast volumes of the characters’ lives.
The Three Stooges film is merely a probable moment of an adventure the trio might encounter in today’s world.   We can’t expect the film to remain in the same era — the shorts began as vaudeville in the early ’20s — nor expect it to strictly abide by the minute details of the characters’ histories. 
Such a replication wouldn’t be relevant to today’s audiences. If you want the original Stooges in this film, you might want to head over to the nearest Blockbuster to rent the black and white adventures of the long-gone actors on DVD.
The Three Stooges may be a hilarious take on the infamous trio or it may be a total flop. But we should at least judge the film by its own merits and as a separate entity, rather than make assumptions based on our predisposed emotional attachment to the source material.
Decide for yourself on April 4, 2012, when the film is set to be released.
