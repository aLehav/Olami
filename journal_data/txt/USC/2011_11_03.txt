As more information is sent on smartphones, the risk of that data being lost or stolen can rise, a concern students said affects them dramatically.

“My life is in my cell phone,” said Emily Barth, a senior majoring in communication. “In this new age of technology, it is especially important to monitor your apps, texts, messages, and other data hackers can access.”
According to an Oracle Communication survey, 42 percent of cell phone users said their data has increased within the last year, yet only 32 percent of those users feel their information is secure.
“I’ve never had my phone hacked into, so I don’t worry about it on a daily basis,” Barth said. “But it is something we should all think about.”
McAfee Secure, the world’s largest technology security company, reported a significant increase in iPhone and Android hacking in 2011.
Chrissy Piña, a junior majoring in screen writing, said she is aware phone hacking is a growing problem but admits she does not take as many precautions as she should.
“I delete my voicemails as soon as I hear them, but I don’t worry about texts or pictures because they aren’t incriminating,” Piña said. “I suppose its just blindness. I’m aware of the danger, but I can’t live in fear worrying about some random hacker breaking into my phone.”
Viruses and other forms of malware can be spread to handheld devices through data networks, synchronizations with desktop computers, tainted storage media, Internet downloads, messaging services and Bluetooth communications, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology’s most recent Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security. Such malware can result in data interception, service abuse that causes higher than expected costs for the user, data theft and network access for the hacker.
Joel Kutz, a sophomore majoring in film and television production, said he is concerned about an increase in phone hacking, so he does not keep any private information in his phone.
“I’ve got nothing to hide.” Kutz said. “But in general, I believe we as students have a false sense of comfort and should take many more precautions to keep personal information safe not just in cell phones but also on social media sites and emails.”
The National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends users protect their cell phone data by using built-in security features like PINs and passwords, avoiding storage of sensitive information on phones, turning wireless interfaces off when not in use and being careful about the sites they use and the items they download. The report said users should also add prevention and detection software when they can.
Maddy Lindsay, a junior majoring in communication, said she has been a victim of cyber crime and as a result deletes her texts and pictures in case of future attack.
“Ever since my Facebook got hacked and someone hijacked my status I’ve been definitely concerned about the privacy of all my digital data especially in my cell phone,” Lindsay said. “I delete texts and pictures regularly and use elaborate passwords to protect my data.”

Students are taking action to curb the amount of abuse and sexual violence that occurs on the USC campus.
Though the importance of maintaining healthy relationships is promoted every year at USC nationally college statistics point to an increasing trend in sexual violence.
Forty-three percent of college women experience violence and abusive dating behavior, according to the 2011 College Dating Violence and Abuse Poll.
Violence and abusive dating includes sexual assault behavior, a sexual act committed without consent.
USC has an average of 15 sexual assaults per semester, according to the USC Center for Men & Women, which handles student-against-student gender-based discrimination.
Danielle Lancon, director of the USC Center for Women & Men, said USC’s annual dating and assault rate remains relatively stable.
“We normally maintain the same amount of dating violence or assaults here every year,” Lancon said. “Hook-ups are obviously not reported but as always they are a large part of any university.”
The poll also revealed that, of women who engage in a hook-up during their time at college, 14 percent will need a friend to remind them what happened, 49 percent will never see the partner again and 16 percent will say they felt pressured into the sexual encounter.
USC Men CARE, an organization devoted to stopping sexual violence on campus, provides a place for men to come together through workshops, service programs and sharing personal experiences. Men CARE also works with the Greek system to educate its members.
“We speak to a lot of the fraternities and have different workshops where we’ll discuss certain situations, such as dating violence and consent,” said Todd Henneman, program director of Men CARE.
Fifty-eight percent of college students said they did not know how to help a victim of dating abuse, according to the poll.
Henneman said an important aspect of handling a situation where dating violence or an unintentional hook-up is anticipated is the way you approach the male or female involved in the situation.
“To speak up on something more subtle that separates the two if they be at a party or gathering is important,” Henneman said. “You can go up and tell the guy you need him to help you with something. This can help settle the situation without being controversial.”
Men CARE advises USC students on various ways to ask for consent. They also share reactions felt by survivors of sexual violence and discuss how to be supportive when a friend is the victim of sexual violence.
“If you are stuck in a situation of dating violence, it’s one thing to go through it yourself, but we have a support system here for students and hopefully they will be able to take advantage of it,” Henneman said.
What does dating violence have to do with “hook ups”? You have confused me? Sounds like you are blaming all hook ups on the guys, and claiming the girls are ALL innocent victums who really didnt want to hook up…..yeaaaaaaaaaa…..

The USC School of Cinematic Arts is launching the “Comedy@SCA” initiative that will attempt to establish USC as a pioneer in the field of comedy.
Groundbreaking · The School of Cinematic Arts said it wants USC to be the foremost school in the nation for comedic studies. - Nathaniel Gonzales | Daily Trojan
 
Through new courses and concentrations, students will be able to specialize in writing, directing, editing, shooting and producing comedy.
The School of Cinematic Arts said it will be the first university in the country to offer a comedy program of this calibre.
“There is not, that we know of, in an academic intuition, in the world, that teaches comedy at the level that we are talking about,” said Barnet Kellman, a professor of Film and Television Production and Co-Director of Comedy@SCA Institute.
A comedy festival will jumpstart the initiative. Co-hosted by Comedy@SCA and Visions and Voices, the festival will bring some of the best-known comedians, such as Steve Carell, to USC to lecture, discuss and preview some of their best work.
“I can easily say there has never been anything like this [comedy festival], maybe in Los Angeles history,” said Jack Epps Jr., associate professor and first endowed chair in comedy.
Kellman said schools have historically shied away from teaching comedy.
“[Comedy] has been considered the mystery subject,” Kellman said. “In other words there is prejudice, in almost a positive way toward comedy, which says you either can do it or you can’t. It is one of the few subjects where people throw up their hands and say you can’t really teach it.”
He said the School of Cinematic Arts strives to become a center for students aspiring to learn comedy.
“We are going to try to do it better,” Kellman said. “We are going to say that USC and the School of Cinematic Arts is the perfect place to test that proposition, and to become a center for young people who want to come and focus their talents toward the learning and the sharpening of their comedic skills.”
Students and faculty alike said this program can be an opportunity to put USC graduates ahead of everyone else.
“[Comedy] is really essential for all of us to know,” said Alex Convery, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting. “If you can learn to do each genre really well, then you’re set. To look into the specifics of comedy is a really smart thing to do as a school.”
Ultimately the initiative seeks to help students jobs secure in the comedy industry.  Kellman said he would want producers and networks to look at USC for employees first.
“We want when those people, those producers and those networks who are thinking where is the new comedy talent, where do I look first, where are the ones that know how to direct … they think let’s look at those USC films,” Kellman said. “We want to become known for that.”
Other students agree that focusing on comedy is essential and is something they have not seen a lot of at USC thus far.
“Comedy is one of the things that I do,” said Matt Podobinski, a senior majoring in film and television production.  “Sometimes in my classes when I try to do comedy it is not seen on the same level or seen as high art. I feel as if it is almost frowned upon.”
Podobinski said he is impressed that the School of Cinematic Arts is focusing more on comedy.
“Comedy isn’t easy to teach at all,” Podobinski said. “Of all the genres of film and television, comedy is the hardest because you are trying to get that result and trying to get that laugh. It is very result oriented. The fact that they are specializing in it is awesome because, as such a difficult genre to make films in, this is something that we can develop.”
The School of Cinematic Arts will introduce a new course in spring 2013 called Late Night Comedy that will be based on the format used by Saturday Night Live. Students will get to write, act and direct skits and get a feel for the many different aspects of comedy.
The plan is to add to the existing curriculum one course at a time, eventually creating a separate track for students who want to emphasize in comedy.
“We have a lot of comedy faculty here, but it was never really organized together,” Epps said. “We never really put it into a curriculum where people could start and study and come here to hone their comic voice and comic instincts.”
In its most basic form, the heart of the initiative is to provide instruction in areas where it was not previously available.
“’SC is the place where this can be done,” Kellman said. “Nobody else could do this, so we have to do it.”

It’s looking more and more like the Pac-12 volleyball regular season championship will come down to USC’s season finale against No. 1 UCLA on Nov. 25, but until then, the Women of Troy know they need to take care of business against their other conference foes.
After splitting road games this weekend, USC is tied atop the conference standings with the Bruins.
No. 10 Washington and Washington State come into Los Angeles this weekend hoping to take some luster off of the season finale between the crosstown rivals.
The Women of Troy (18-4, 13-2) will start the weekend, hosting the Cougars (12-12, 4-10), who have lost five of their last six matches.
“[Jen Greeny] is new, but she’s really motivated them to compete hard,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “So our players can’t take them lightly in any way shape or form. Washington State will come to play, so if we don’t play our best, then we’ll have our hands full.”
The Cougars are led by outside hitter Meagan Ganzer, who is first in the Pac-12 in kills per set (4.91) and points per set (5.46). Ganzer has 103 more kills than anyone else in the conference.
“She’s their go-to player,” Bateman said. “Stopping her is one of our main concerns, not letting her have a great night against us.”
The senior All-American said the performance of the middle blockers will be key to shutting down Ganzer and the rest of Washington State’s hitters.
Senior Lauren Williams, sophomore Alexis Olgard and freshman Hannah Schraer have been rotating in the two middle blocker spots.
Williams and Schraer will start Friday night against Washington to give Olgard, who is experiencing some swelling in her knee while recovering from offseason surgery, a rest.
“I’ve been working really hard because it took me a while to get back in a rhythm in practice,” Olgard said. “When I finally got back to starting [last weekend] it felt really normal, like it should.”
Olgard, who made her first start of the season last weekend against California, will spell Schraer in the starting lineup again on Saturday night against Washington.
USC swept the Huskies on the road Sept. 16 to jump start a 12-match winning streak that ended when the team lost to Stanford last weekend.
Washington has lost three of its past six matches, but it still stands at the top of several statistical categories in the Pac-12.
The Huskies are first in blocks per set (3.57), opponent hitting percentage (.130) and service aces per set (1.64).
“Washington is a physical team. They’re really strong,” Bateman said. “They put up a big block every time we play them. So [our plan] will be just about being smart and making the right decisions for our hitters.”
Haley said the team is eager to get some revenge against UCLA in the season finale but emphasizes the importance of every game until then.
“We don’t overlook anybody and we don’t try to assume anything,” Haley said. “Every week for the next three weeks, we’ve got two matches that we have to prepare well for.”
The players echoed similar sentiments about the remaining games in conference play.
“It’s going to be a battle until the end,” senior setter Kendall Bateman said. “Any team can be the best any given night so you just have to be ready to play.”

The USC men’s and women’s diving teams will host the Trojan Diving Invitational on Friday and Saturday at McDonald’s Stadium.
For the Trojans, this event provides the opportunity for the highly ranked teams to get started on the right foot and to make early statements.
The men’s diving squad, led by three first-time divers, looks to continue its success from last season. Freshmen Jordan Gear and Jason Harter will compete for the Trojans, as will junior Cody Walwick, who is a first-time diver.
Last season the men’s swim and dive squad finished at No. 7 after strong performances at the NCAA championships. This year USC has higher goals, and Saturday’s meet is the first step toward achieving them.
“We [have been] looking for a training result since the beginning of the season,” USC coach Hongping Li said. “This meet will provide a warm up for the dual meet coming up next week against [Arizona and Arizona State].”
On the women’s team, three-time Pac-10 diver of the year senior Victoria Ishimatsu returns to lead the team to even greater heights than last year’s squad, which finished No. 5 in the country at season’s end. Joining Ishimatsu will be freshmen Jessie Warren and Celia Pinczower.
Ishimatsu appears to be the story on the women’s side.
She was named an All-American in two events, the 1-meter springboard and the 3-meter springboard. She also won the Pac-10 championship in the 3-meter springboard.
This is the first major tournament of the season, and will include last year’s national champion California. For many of the divers, it will be their first collegiate competition.
“I am sure many first competitors in this event will be excited and anticipate to compete to their potential,” Li said. “It will be a good test for all divers early in the season.”
Though this is the first event of the year, Li expects the Trojans to perform to the best of their abilities.
“[We want] to see the divers to be able to perform [at] the level they have been trained,” Li said.
Also competing will be Stanford, which finished in the top five in the men’s and women’s rankings, as well as Arizona, Wisconsin, BYU, Air Force, UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, Fresno State and Cal State Bakersfield.
The meet will begin Friday at 10 a.m. and will continue into Saturday, with the final event  at 11:30 am.

New descriptions for USC senior goalie Joel Dennerley’s contributions to the surging No. 2 USC men’s water polo team are tough to come by. Last week he notched his eighth career Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week award. In USC’s recent six-match winning streak, the goalie has allowed fewer than five goals per contest, fortifying a Trojans’ backline.
Stopper · Senior goalie Joel Dennerley averages almost 10 saves per contest and a conference-best 4.8 goals against average this season. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
“[Dennerley] has been very consistent for us,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “There’s really not enough you can say about him.”
Riding Dennerley’s dominant play, the Trojans (15-2, 5-0) welcome No. 9 Pepperdine to McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Saturday at 1 p.m. In a quick turnaround game, the Trojans will square off against Chapman at 2:30 p.m. for the first time in program history.
Since losing consecutive games in the SoCal tournament to California and UCLA, the Trojans rattled off six straight wins, inevitably drawing parallels to this stretch and last season’s late title run. In 2010, after losing to Stanford and California on Oct. 9 and Oct. 16, respectively, USC never lost again.
Despite the similarities, Vavic insists the two seasons are difficult to compare.
“This season is a little bit different because everybody who is playing us knows our players, and last season they didn’t,” Vavic said. “We started four freshmen in the SoCal tournament last year. The difference is that these teams know our players now and know our strengths and weaknesses better. Last year we were able to do certain things that surprised the opponent, but this year that’s not the case.”
Before a critical matchup against No. 1 UCLA to end the regular season, USC faces a physical Pepperdine team that — although just 2-4 in MPSF play — packs some offensive firepower of its own.
“Pepperdine’s going to be a tough game,” Vavic said. “They’ve played some close games against some really tough opponents, and they have won some games against some very dangerous teams. Size-wise, they are one of the biggest teams out there. They shoot the ball really well.”
If Pepperdine plans to end its 10-game losing streak against USC, the Waves will have to rely on the scoring prowess of attackers Andrew Milcovich and Matthew DeTrane, who have paced Pepperdine with a combined 74 goals — more than any scoring duo for the balanced USC attack. Though not as celebrated as his USC counterpart in Dennerley, Pepperdine goalie Bence Valics has posted an average 9.4 saves per game mark as well.
The formula for postseason seeding for USC cannot be simpler. If the team wins its remaining MPSF games, the Trojans will secure the No. 1 seed for the MPSF tournament. Despite the hot streak, Vavic believes there are still some areas on which the team can continue to improve.
“We can always improve in our transition offense,” Vavic said. “I think we created some opportunities that we didn’t convert against Stanford. Sometimes we really rush things and don’t make good passes. In the game against Stanford, there were a few times where the pass wasn’t there on time or didn’t even arrive. On the defensive side, shot blocking is something we always stress. We’re working on all of these things.”

It’s the way every USC athletics program was meant to end its season: playing UCLA.
That’s what the USC women’s soccer team has in store tonight when it takes on the No. 2 Bruins (14-1-3, 7-1-2) in Westwood. And for the Women of Troy (7-12-0, 4-6-0), it’s a chance to end a subpar season in a special way.
“We’re always pumped up to play UCLA,” senior forward Ashley Freyer said. “At this point, records don’t matter because we’re going to leave everything out on the field.”
Final farewell · Senior defender Ashley Freyer looks to end her USC career on a high note and lead the Women of Troy to a victory at UCLA. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
 
That just about sums up the juxtaposition of these two teams’ seasons. Both opened the season in the top-25 — UCLA at No. 16, USC at No. 25. But while the Women of Troy lost their opening three games and 11 of their first 14, the Bruins surged. UCLA did not lose for nearly the first two months of its season before falling to No. 1 Stanford. The Bruins have won games by staggering scores, including 4-1 over Fresno State, 6-1 against Arizona and, most recently, 8-0 at Colorado.
“They’re one of the best teams in the country,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “No other way to say it.”
Bruin forward Sydney Leroux is one of the premier forwards in the nation with 14 goals in 18 games. To put that in perspective, sophomore forward Elizabeth Eddy leads USC with four goals. As a team, the Women of Troy have just six more goals than Leroux does individually.
“We’re really going to have to handle our business well in the back [against Leroux],” Fryer said. “But if we play the way we can then we will.”
The Bruins’ goal-differential is plus-28; USC’s is minus-10. The Bruins allow exactly half a goal per game — good for 11th nationally — and score 2.1 goals per game. USC, by contrast, scores slightly more than once per game and concedes 1.6 goals each contest.
“We know it’s going to be a challenge for us,” Khosroshahin said. “But this whole season has been a challenge. The ladies have battled through a lot.”
Obviously this season has not gone as expected for a team ranked in the top 25 to start the season. After an 0-3 start, the Women of Troy appeared to get back on the right track with three straight victories, including a 3-1 win over No. 18 Illinois. But things turned south.
The Women of Troy completely outplayed No. 2 Oklahoma State at McAlister Field in their own tournament in early September and took a tough 1-0 loss.
“That one really sticks with me,” Khosroshahin said. “We showed we could compete with anyone in the nation and win the stats with anyone in the nation. But we didn’t win the most important stat that mattered.”
Just two days later, the Women of Troy were only 10 minutes away from a big 1-0 victory over Texas. Instead, the Longhorns conceded a late equalizer and later fell in double overtime.
Those two losses kicked off a stretch of eight straight losses spanning more than two months. But six of those losses came by just one goal. In fact, of the Women of Troy’s 12 losses, just four have come by multiple goals.
“We’ve been so close this whole season,” Khosroshahin said. “Just a bounce here or there and things would be completely different.”
But those bounces haven’t been there, and that means tonight’s matchup takes on a greater importance.
USC has never beaten the Bruins in Westwood in 13 trips there, and USC is just 4-19-1 all time against its crosstown rivals.
Tonight’s matchup kicks off at 7 p.m at UCLA’s Drake Stadium.

In between drills during Thursday’s morning practice at the Galen Center, senior guard Jio Fontan picked up a loose ball and slowly made his way down the length of the floor.
On his way to the basket, Fontan slowly mimicked movements that seemed all too real just a few months ago.
But just as USC’s supposed star attraction went up to punctuate his coast-to-coast journey, something was simply missing.
He couldn’t get off the ground.
The mirage of what could have been for the Trojans this season is apparent every time Fontan — who tore his ACL during a July trip to Brazil — picks up a basketball.
For a team that bares little to no resemblance to the squad that nearly cracked the field of 64 in March, Fontan represented the promise of a new day. He was supposed to be the glue that would hold together last year’s late-season success with a group that’s about as diverse as any in Division I basketball.
USC has been without Fontan throughout all of training camp, and it won’t have him for Saturday’s scrimmage against Long Beach State, or next Friday’s season opener against Cal State Northridge at the Galen Center. And it likely won’t have him for most of the season.
In his absence, we know this about USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s inexperienced band of freshmen, transfers, misfits and unproven talents: They will do so having more holes than people to fill them.
Sophomore guard Maurice Jones instantly becomes the team’s do-it-all scorer at the offensive end. Only one problem: He’s a pass-first point guard who averaged fewer than 10 points per game his freshman season. At 5-foot-7, 155 pounds, Jones’ fearlessness at the basket is laudable, but his perimeter game still doesn’t scream crunch-time performer. When the game gets tight, is this really the guy you want taking the final shot?
I don’ think so — at least not yet.
Freshmen guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley infuse athleticism and unselfishness into an offensive system that was sorely lacking at times last season. But the two are just months removed from their high school proms, so expecting them to instantly develop college-level basketball IQs overnight is naive to say the least.
Apparently, 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game at Antelope Junior College can also create quite the buzz.
That’s what Trojans’ big man sophomore Dewayne Dedmon has brought to the table entering this year. The defensive-minded center might be a force to be reckoned with on the boards and in the shot blocking department, but his offensive game leaves much to be desired. Combine that with a fracture on his shooting hand, and USC’s primary post scorer suddenly doesn’t seem so intimidating.
Junior transfer forward Aaron Fuller from Iowa brings many intangibles to the table at the power forward position.  From offensive put backs to defensive intensity, he is an O’Neill guy through and through. Against the Cal Poly and Morgan States of the world, his 6-foot-6 frame might not be an issue, but against some of the tougher interior teams in the Pac-12, like Oregon, UCLA and Washington, matchup issues are bound to ensue.
From top to bottom, I will admit there is a lot to like about this team despite my apparent sense of cynicism. Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson has beefed up and appears to have developed some maturity out on the court during the off-season after supposedly being involved in an altercation with former USC guard Bryce Jones.
JUCO transfer junior guard Greg Allen will definitely provide a spark off the bench from the 3-point line á la Donte Smith. And junior James Blasczyk, a transfer from Lee College, provides USC with welcomed depth and raw aggression in the post.
But there’s something to be said about having to replace four of your top six players from a year ago, especially when one of them, Nikola Vucevic, was recently selected 16th overall in the NBA draft.
O’Neill has faced more than his fair share of challenges in a coaching career that spans more than three decades. From replacing Lute Olsen at Arizona to working with a poorly assembled roster in 2003 with the Toronto Raptors to motivating a USC team with no postseason to play for because of sanctions, the colorful coach as been there and done that.
But something tells me this set of circumstances was never in the job descriptions O’Neill never really desired.
You can put lipstick on a pig, as O’Neill has done in recent weeks, but sadly sometimes it still remains a pig.
Though you can bank on this team playing hard every night from November to March, at the end of the day will that really be enough?
“I know one thing, regardless of how things play out, it’s going to be a roller coaster this year,” O’Neill said on Thursday.
The question remains: How long will the coaches, the players and the fans stay along for the ride?

I’m all for giving an objective, and even a critical assessment, but are you sure you don’t write for the Daily Bruin?!  Seriously…
Hey, it’s USC.  They will be on that ride all the way, and engineering it, too.

For USC, November has typically been a good month.
Lockdown · Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey recorded a combined 16 tackles, two interceptions and a touchdown against Notre Dame and Stanford. His play has been a key reason for USC’s defensive improvement. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
 
From 2000-2009 under former coach Pete Carroll, the Trojans compiled a 25-1 record.
But this is a different situation,  a different year. And many pundits have picked this spot as a “letdown situation.”
With then-No. 20 USC coming off an emotional, triple-overtime loss against No. 4 Stanford, playing against Heisman frontrunner quarterback Andrew Luck, now the No. 21 Trojans (6-2, 3-2) must travel to Boulder, Colo., and face a one-win Colorado squad on a six-game losing streak.
Despite this, the players insist the Buffaloes (1-8, 0-6) have their full attention.
“We look at every opponent like they’re the best opponent on our schedule,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “We’re not underestimating them. If we come out and focus on USC and ourselves, then everything will take care of itself.”
But Robey could be the lone usual starter in the secondary tonight. Junior safety T.J. McDonald will sit out the first half for an illegal hit against Stanford, redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris is still recovering from a shoulder injury and junior safety Jawanza Starling is questionable with an unspecified injury.
Robey, however, has been the backbone of the USC defense, starting every game this year. The coaching staff also praised his play, which has coincided with the improved play of the defense during the last three games against California, Notre Dame and Stanford.
“[What’s] really been a big part of our improvement on defense is Nickell [Robey] playing well,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Matching him up on their guys and really taking them out of rhythm, then obviously two huge fourth-quarter interceptions that almost win both games for us … he’s playing at a really high level and it’s great to see, for a kid who’s just a true sophomore.”
In its last three contests, USC’s defense has forced nine turnovers. Colorado, however, has only committed seven turnovers through nine games; the team ranks sixth in the nation. Quarterback Tyler Hansen is responsible for six of those turnovers, throwing six interceptions compared to just 14 touchdowns.
The Buffaloes’ offense has struggled recently, too, averaging fewer than 12 points per contest in their last four games. For the year, Colorado ranks 111th in the nation in scoring offense. Some of its struggles can be attributed to the absences of wide receiver Paul Richardson and tailback Rodney Stewart. Both have missed time because of knee injuries and both are questionable to play against USC.
Though Colorado’s offense might be struggling, USC’s offense seems to have found its stride in the last three games, averaging more than 36 points per game and 396 total yards. Most notably, the running game for the Trojans is starting to click behind the play of junior tailback Curtis McNeal. The Los Angeles native has turned in back-to-back 100-plus rushing yard performances, including a career-high 145 yards last weekend against Stanford. Though he fumbled in the third overtime, the coaching staff believes O’Neal is ready to bounce back.
“He’s had a couple great games in a row,” Kiffin said. “Now he needs to do it again and go up there and like I’ve said before, if you go on the road, especially in bad weather conditions, regardless [if it’s on the road] you better pack your run-defense and your run game. [McNeal] is a critical part of that right now.”
The running game’s improvement, in large part, can be attributed to the play of the offensive line. Though the coaching staff was forced to mix and match lineups during the first half of the season, now, it appears, the unit has found some continuity and balance.
“We’ve had tremendous progress,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “Before we couldn’t run on anybody. Now we’re running [really well]. It has a lot to do with us getting a lot closer and bonding as an offense. We’re more comfortable and as a whole, the line has got some good chemistry going.”
And that line has allowed junior quarterback Matt Barkley to find his open receivers time and time again. Sacked four times this season, Barkley has connected with his top target, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, 81 times for 991 yards and nine touchdowns. Though the statistics might not show it, Woods has been hampered by a nagging ankle injury all season long. Despite his ailment, the coaching staff has been impressed with the way Woods has handled his injury.
“It just says who he is,” Kiffin said. “He’s that special that can be injured and be that tough to have those type of numbers but also prepare enough to line up in all those spots that he does.”
Woods is not the only offensive player dealing with injuries. Senior tailback Marc Tyler is still recovering from a dislocated shoulder he re-aggravated last weekend against Stanford, and freshman tailback George Farmer did not practice all week because of an ankle injury.
Despite the distractions and injuries coming into the game, USC understands it must not take Colorado lightly despite its record.
“They’re not a bad team,” Kalil said. “The main emphasis starting with Notre Dame is: ‘It’s all about us.’ It’s not about any other team we play. We play the same play against any team we go against, so that’s the attitude we have to come out with.”
Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. and the game will be televised on ESPN.
FIGHT ON, BEAT THE BUFFS!!!!

Sometimes it’s not the future that gets people buzzing, but the past. Though some films get derided for butchering history, others gleefully flaunt substitute narratives; these unapologetic deviations are often more acclaimed by critics and history buffs alike. Alternative history films are a small niche, but they encompass a lot of material; from Nazis to superheroes to Shakespeare, these films show humanity’s unwavering curiosity.
Possible proxies · Movies like Anonymous, which questions the legitimacy of Shakespeare’s (Rafe Spall, pictured center) authorship, offer viewers intriguing versions of famous people and events. - Photo courtesy of Columbia TriStar Marketing Group Inc.
It is human nature to ask, “What if?” What if wars had gone another way, or what if one key event changed the world as we know it? Such questions have led to amazing inventions and discoveries, but they have also led to a lot of creative work, particularly in film.
The most recent film of this nature is Anonymous. The flick, starring Rhys Evans and Vanessa Redgrave, crafts a different history in which the author of Shakespeare’s plays was actually the Earl of Oxford — and Queen Elizabeth had a few other bastards in the woodwork.
Meanwhile, Resistance, which premiered at the Cambridge Film Festival in September, explores what could have happened if the Nazis had reached Britain. Similar films like Inglorious Basterds and Watchmen have also depicted variant wartime chronicles.
World War II seems to be the most common event for alternative history. Nazis, as film subjects, are relentless like cockroaches; Nazis seem to reappear in media and entertainment, if only so Brits and Americans can kill them again. World War II captures the imagination for multiple reasons. It was relatively recent and was a war the Nazis could have won, if not for the luck and the fortitude of leaders like Winston Churchill. It is also one of the few moments of good vs. evil; you don’t get people much nastier than the Nazis.
HBO’s 1994 Fatherland, based on the bestselling novel by the same name, asked a simple question: What if Germany had won and a massive chunk of Europe had become Germania? Taking place in the 1960s, the storyline follows a detective who investigates the murder of a Nazi official before a meeting between Adolf Hitler and John F. Kennedy. The story is a thriller, and the world it paints is fascinating.
Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds spins a different take on World War II. What if the war ended early, as the result of a vengeful Jewish theater owner and a squad of Jewish-American soldiers led by Brad Pitt? The storyline portrays a gory — and successful — assassination attempt on Hitler, with far more gunplay and pop culture references than the historical Operation Valkyrie.
Even the trope of good vs. evil seems to warrant exploration. In Resistance, D-Day has failed and the Nazis are invading. From the trailer, it appears Resistance will draw a line between “Nazi” and “German soldier.” History, even alternate history, is often tastier with a dash of ambiguity.
Some alternative stories border on the fantastical. Watchmen, originally a graphic novel by Alan Moore, was adapted to film in 2009. The film shows what America might look like if it had superheroes — of the legitimately superhuman and the masked vigilante variety. In the short term, superheroes helped America win Vietnam. By the 1980s, however, the picture is bleak: Congress has outlawed superheroes, America is a hair’s breadth from nuclear war with Russia and Richard Nixon won multiple re-elections. Though the film was criticized for its ponderous slow-motion and overly rigid adherence to the graphic novel, it presented an interesting look at America — an America largely shaped by fear and suspicion. Showing what something is not is often a roundabout way of showing what it is.
Films like Anonymous are not so much critiques on the past as thought experiments. They take a theory, in this case the real identity of Shakespeare, and explore it. Another film to take this route is Gladiator, which gives an alternative reason for Emperor Commodus’ real-life death-by-gladiator. It is part for fun and part for juicy intrigue, which always sells in Hollywood. And unlike films that butcher historical fact, people who know the history behind Gladiator can chuckle at plausible conjectures.
We have always played pretend. In earlier times, it was plays; now it is predominantly film. Using history, gives the viewer a preconceived world and makes it all the more entertaining when the story deceives expectations. Teachers and tutors, too, should rejoice; it might not be correct, but it gets people interested.

For a movie series about two stoners, the Harold and Kumar films are surprisingly socially conscious.
The first film, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, was a subtle and brilliant critique of stereotypes in rural regions hidden under the veneer of a munchies-driven road trip.
Faded troublemakers · Harold (John Cho, left) and Kumar (Kal Penn) bring their classic themes of sophomoric pranks and stoner humor to their latest film A Very Harold & Kumar 3-D Christmas. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
 
The second, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, attempted to bring satire to the film’s forefront, targeting politics and terrorism, but ultimately failed because of its lack of wit.
Now the series is going after Christmas.
A Very Harold & Kumar 3-D Christmas reunites the infamous duo. Harold (John Cho) is now married and living an uptight, corporate life. Kumar (Kal Penn) has lost his ambition and drive in life, preferring to smoke pot all day. When he discovers his ex-girlfriend is pregnant, he’s left at a loss.
The delinquent duo reassembles on Christmas Eve, and things immediately go awry. Trying to please Harold’s Christmas-obsessed father-in-law (Danny Trejo, subverting his usual tough-guy role), Harold and Kumar end up on another night of adventure.
Unfortunately, the adventure is more over-the-top than any of the other installments. Much of the film meanders into pranks that ultimately do not serve the point of the film. Waffle-making robots, Ukranian gangsters, musical numbers and other shenanigans are sprinkled throughout the movie, yet feel more like sketches than progressing plot points.
The plot is predictable and cliché, but puts heavy emphasis on the film’s side characters.
Unfortunately, the side characters are not that interesting.
Kumar gains a sidekick in Aaron (Amir Blomenfeld of CollegeHumor fame), who comes off as Blomenfeld’s usual persona, with fewer amusing lines. Additionally, Tom Lennon plays Harold’s milquetoast co-worker who, while amusing at first, grows staid midway through the film.
These characters overshadow the series’ other main star: Neil Patrick Harris, who returns as a drugged-up, nymphomaniac self-parody. As with the last two films, Harris is entertaining and has great chemistry with Cho and Penn, but his screen time is cut short.
The film does much better with its leads. Cho and Penn continue to have excellent chemistry as Harold and Kumar, and their relationship arc is one of the film’s better parts. The range they manage to bring to a stoner comedy is enjoyable, and Cho’s ability to go from aggressive to frantic to enigmatic at the drop of a line is particularly noteworthy.
The film’s satire is what makes this movie from being a complete mess. The film keeps the commentary subtle, more akin to White Castle’s treatment than Guantanamo Bay’s in-your-face flair.
Shout outs to “’Twas the Night Before Christmas” and A Christmas Carol are scattered throughout the movie, with a very snarky twist befitting the absurdity and humor of the series.
Most notably, 3-D Christmas takes elements from iconic Christmas specials and runs with them. It’s strange and unexpected, but the film eventually becomes so surreal that drug-fueled scenes of angry snowmen and Santa’s sleigh feel natural.
The satire gets particularly good when the duo’s Jewish friends Rosenberg (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Goldstein (David Krumholtz) enter. Another direction is added to the satire, targeting the holiday as a whole and not just its specific tropes. Like the leads, Rosenberg and Goldstein continue to be highly entertaining characters and provide a dose of humor in a movie stuck with poor quips and a weak plot.
The movie is highly self-aware — more so than any other installment in the series. Jokes aimed at Cho and Penn’s other roles provide some of the better laughs, while the sole Harris scene plays with the fourth wall and the general formulas of mainstream films.
3-D Christmas particularly pokes fun at the use of 3-D in films, mocking its gimmickry and making the very obviously made-for-3-D bits more over-the-top and random than they logically should be.
A Very Harold & Kumar 3-D Christmas isn’t the best film of the series, and not that great of a film in general, but it does manage to provide a satirical edge better than its predecessors. It’s a shame the good moments don’t fully redeem the movie.

Halloween’s over, which means one thing for many of us: Christmas is coming.
Though Christmas features plenty of iconic images and elements, there’s one aspect that’s been a particularly constant part of modern holiday culture: the pop Christmas album.
Justin Bieber’s new album Under the Mistletoe is an interesting proposition. It’s curious that he’s decided to release a holiday-themed record as his second full-length work. And it’s even stranger that, for a Christmas album, the traditional songs aren’t particularly great.
Take his version of the classic “Santa Claus is Coming to Town,” for instance. It sounds stylistically and musically like an odd and unremarkable caricature of the Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back” and features background singers pitch-corrected into saccharine submission.
When Bieber sings Shake it, shake it baby, over and over in the bridge, it doesn’t feel fun; rather, it comes off as cliché.
And why include a note-for-note rendition of Mariah Carey’s 1994 chart-smashing “All I Want for Christmas Is You”? It’s an inoffensive duet cover from Carey and Bieber, but the inclusion seems vaguely lazy, as if the pair just couldn’t think of a new song to tackle.
This laziness isn’t confined to just that track. Though there might be musical creativity in covering traditional holiday songs, Under the Mistletoe often feels like it’s simply going through the motions.
Even some of the originals can be aggravatingly bland. Is the country-crossover tune “Home This Christmas” easy to listen to? Sure. But the song is also mind-numbingly predictable in structure, sounding like a diluted rip-off of Taylor Swift’s lesser works.
And although “Mistletoe” might be the album’s lead single, it’s not much to behold. The distinctive faux-reggae feel of the song, coupled with the chorus ripped straight out of “I’m Yours,” leaves only one logical conclusion: Bieber went back in time and robbed Jason Mraz at gunpoint for his music.
Thankfully, when Bieber chooses to execute his signature, eclectic, R&B-laced, pop sound, it’s a different game.
“Only Thing I Ever Get for Christmas” is a brilliantly melancholy album-opener that shows off Bieber’s newly changed voice, now huskier and darker. And “Christmas Eve,” co-written by Chris Brown, is a seductively brooding slow jam that proves Bieber is an R&B force to be reckoned with.
Of course, how could we forget the surreal “Drummer Boy”? It’s an unpredictable jaw-dropper, if only because of the return of “Shawty Mane,” Bieber’s so-called rapping alter-ego.
It’s weird if you haven’t heard him rap before, and some lines, like It’s crazy how some people say they don’t care / When there’s people on the street with no food, it’s not fair, are more than a little ham-fisted, but the sheer ridiculousness of the track works, especially when Busta Rhymes jumps in with his fluid, machine-gun flow.
Paradoxically, although big-time collaborations with artists such as Usher and Boyz II Men help strengthen Under the Mistletoe’s tracks, they also undermine Bieber’s independence as an artist. Sometimes it feels as if a guest was brought in to prop-up an otherwise unremarkable song.
Inexperience and a lack of vision also shows in the haphazard album, which stumbles from Christmas carol to country tune to acoustic pop and so on. The instrumentation suffers from it too; though the production is slick, the backing tracks often sound generic and unfocused.
Under the Mistletoe proves that what Bieber needs most is to find his own direction — not the record company’s, nor the producers,’ but something that’s his and only his. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, and it’s clear Bieber is a superstar who’s here to stay, but his immaturity as an artist is a puzzle he hasn’t quite cracked.
As a sophomore, full-length album, Under the Mistletoe is the equivalent of the color beige: It’s hard to be really compelled by it. There’s simply not enough of the memorable music that shot Bieber into the pop-culture stratosphere in the first place, although those already infected with Bieber fever will argue otherwise.
Love him or hate him, Bieber is a promising young artist who won’t be derailed by an uneven Christmas album. It will take time for him to figure out what his sound truly should be. It’s just unfortunate that Under the Mistletoe isn’t anywhere close to a breakthrough.
I don’t know what album you are listening to but Under The Mistletoe is AWESOME!!!! I’m not a teenager or even in my twenties and I think this young man has more talent than just about any other artist out there.  I think you need to go listen to Christmas Love from the deluxe version and then say Bieber doesn’t have direction

More than 700 workers at the Keck Medical Center of USC recently striked, aiming to increase wages and benefits from their current standard, which workers feel is grossly unfair.
Caregivers expressed that they were not receiving the same retirement plan and tuition assistance as other hospital nurses and university employees, among other complaints.
Striking is a viable method to achieve these goals. Though some might consider it to be too strong of a reaction, striking is an essential avenue of expression. It increases publicity, and the 24-hour hospital strike was notable enough to be covered by all major local media outlets.
Through an increase of publicity, it is possible that other unions, or merely people sympathetic to the workers’ cause, will contribute as well.
Here, with the voice of discontent from the employees, workers have the perfect opportunity to implement a system that effectively caters to employees.
The workers have been negotiating since fall 2010, and clearly the strike was one of their last options to try to come to a fair agreement. Once all else fails, a strike is the next logical action to forcefully display that the current situation must be fixed.
Though the hospital had replacement workers in that day, these 700 workers on strike know the system better and replacement workers would need a significant amount of experience and training to be able to work at the same level.
The hospital left the workers no choice but to go on strike in an attempt to earn fair compensation and benefits.
Protests and striking have come to the forefront of the public eye in the wake of the Occupy movement and show a growing trend of restlessness and first-hand democratic action.
When done with a purpose, striking is an effective way to integrate yourself into the democratic process, instead of letting politicians or lawyers do the fighting for you. This is no exception.
The workers had grown tired of their conditions and took appropriate and necessary action to try to better their situation.
Regardless of whether a strike works — take the 2007 Hollywood Writer’s Guild strike — it demonstrates that the voice of the people will be heard and felt. This country was founded on democratic ideals and a right to free speech.
If workers are legitimately dissatisfied with working conditions, they have a right to strike. No one should have fewer benefits than another person. If you are at the same workplace, you should be able to receive those benefits too.
Strikes also demonstrate a measure of solidarity within the workforce. It shows the problem is serious and has an effect on the entire group, rather than a minority.
If a strike can achieve goals for the common good, such as addressing the grievances of the employees at the university hospital, then I can’t see how this is looked upon negatively. Hopefully, the people’s voice will be heard.

The debate over workers’ rights and unions, which often receives constant attention nationwide, came to USC last month.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Workers at the Keck Medical Center of USC went on a 24-hour strike on Oct. 12 to air their grievances against the hospital, including short staffing, a potential one-year wage freeze and underwhelming benefits.
Workers have every right to organize peacefully in trade unions to address their grievances. But in the case of the Keck strike, unionization is essentially unnecessary.
Workers should not drop everything and picket if they don’t get an extra benefit.
And if they do drop everything and picket every time, they shouldn’t be able to get their jobs back.
Striking is democratic but entirely ineffective in most cases. By merely walking out on the job, workers do not generate good will for themselves.
Rather than being sympathetic figures under supposedly unfair circumstances, they appear to be the opposite.
Legal action is an effective approach to earn better rights and they rightly ended their strike after a day, choosing to pursue a compromise in a hearing on Oct. 24 before the National Labor Relation Board.
Those who went on strike were not nurses or doctors, but people who held a variety of caregiving and technical positions.
They were represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers, an organization that arranged the strike.
Among other issues, the workers protested the small size of the staff and inadequate retirement plans or family tuition assistance as compared with employees in higher-level positions.
Those protesting their comparative lack of benefits, however, are not on the same pay scale.Thus, their level of work at the hospital does not merit the same rewards.
Those in higher-level positions have earned better rewards for their work and for the contributions they make in their place or area of work.
In addition, the strikers already received salaries that were competitive with other local hospitals.
The hospital’s NUWH employees are also some of the highest paid in the local area.
Working conditions do not have to be at an Industrial Revolution-era level to justify strikes. If workers are really being treated unjustly, they should use the legal means available to them to ameliorate the situation.
Striking, however, can be seen as just another frivolous endeavor.
A hospital is an essential institution and the workforce knows that.
One of the problems of unions became apparent with the Keck hospital workers’ strike: Some unions run on the assumption, at least partially, that everyone deserves equal pay and benefits.
Not everyone, however, deserves the exact same benefits just because they are workers. Because some workers have earned higher-level positions and they deserve better benefits.
To protest against something so simply logical in the name of labor rights gives the unionization movement, and the Keck strikers, a bad name.

Following a heartbreaking triple-overtime loss to Stanford, USC will try and rebound in the Rockies as it takes on a dismal Colorado squad. The Buffaloes (1-8, 0-5 PAC-12) have struggled mightily in their first season in the PAC 12. They will continue their search for their first conference victory when they take on the the Trojans (6-2, 3-2 PAC-12) on Friday night.
The main reason for Colorado’s lack of success has been its defense. The Buffs rank 100th nationally in total defense, allowing 434 yards per game. To make matters worse, opponents have posted 45 touchdowns against Colorado, the 3rd highest total in the country.
The Buffaloes’ pass defense has been a particular area of concern for first year head coach Jon Embree. On average, his secondary forfeits 249 yards through the air per game, the 92nd best total in the country. The 22 pass touchdowns that Colorado has allowed are the 2nd highest total in the nation.
With the level that Matt Barkley is playing at right now, the Buffalo defensive backs could be in for a long night. Look for the USC passing game to thrive in Boulder, just as it has all season long. Colorado’s secondary will be put through the ringer yet again, and the Buffs first PAC-12 win will again likely be put on hold.
