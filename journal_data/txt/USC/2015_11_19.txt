Shawn Anderson was crossing Jefferson Boulevard at the corner of Figueroa Street on Oct. 30 when he and his parents were stopped by a Los Angeles Police Department traffic officer. Anderson, a freshman majoring in international relations, recalled feeling confusion and then shock as the officer explained that he had been stopped for violating the city’s jaywalking code and wrote him and his parents each a citation.
“I was kind of stunned the whole time because at first I thought he was just going to tell us to be more careful,” Anderson said.
Jaywalking hadn’t even crossed Anderson’s mind. He, like many others, was unaware that California Vehicle Code 21456 prohibits pedestrians from stepping off the curb once the crosswalk timer starts counting down. This law, however, is just one of many reasons that LAPD officers have begun enforcing jaywalking laws more strictly in recent months — a process that has affected students around campus and brought traffic policing into the spotlight.
A spike in collisions
Shawn’s case is not unique. This year, LAPD has stepped up its efforts to enforce the city’s jaywalking laws around the USC area, according to Capt. David Kowalski, head of the LAPD South Traffic Division. According to Kowalski, LAPD noticed an increase in the number of pedestrian-related traffic collisions, many of them fatal, within the vicinity of the University Park Campus at the start of the year; as a whole, the South Traffic Division has seen more than 100 serious pedestrian-related collisions to date this year, compared to 90 at this time last year.
“Because USC has such a high volume of people on the street, both students and residents, we’ve had a bigger push to enforce [jaywalking laws] there,” Kowalski said. “Figueroa is one of the most high-volume areas for these types of collisions, so that’s one of the areas that we direct our officers to.”
According to Kowalski, these measures have had an impact on pedestrian safety in the area; since beginning their more active enforcement program, officers have noticed collisions involving pedestrians going down.
That’s because crosswalk countdowns are designed with pedestrian safety in mind, according to James Moore, a professor of industrial and systems engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“If a student that tends to be athletic and young and highly mobile chooses to race across the street because there are 11 seconds left and he or she expects to make it, that’s a different level of risk than somebody who’s less mobile, who might not be able to clear the crosswalk in time,” he said. “And the traffic engineer doesn’t know who’s going to be making the decision, so they have to design for an average performance plus a safety margin.”
Questions of enforcement
Kowalski emphasized that police officers are directed to prioritize educating people over penalizing them; as a result, they aim to give out written warning citations, which don’t go on a person’s criminal record, as much as possible.
“It’s a huge positive impact for us because it makes what’s perceived as a negative contact with police into a positive one, and we’re educating [pedestrians] without hurting their record or the inconvenience of going to court or [receiving] a fine,” Kowalski said.
However, pedestrian traffic enforcement doesn’t always play out as planned. Some students, such as Shannon Reiffen, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, have received traffic tickets with fines as high as $200. Others, such as Joann Lin, a freshman accounting major, walked away with just a verbal warning.
This wide discrepancy in jaywalking penalties, according to Kowalski, is due to the fact that enforcement is left up to the individual officer’s discretion — he or she can decide to give out a ticket, a citation or a verbal warning, depending on whether a student is able to provide a “valid reason” for jaywalking or not.
“We don’t give [our officers] a number or a quota [of tickets] — what we ask our officers to do is to have as many contacts as possible with the public,” Kowalski said. “Every contact is a little different, and every police officer is a little different, but the thing we stress with our officers is to treat everyone with respect, treat everyone equally, be fair and professional during every contact.”
A city-wide problem
According to Kowalski, LAPD doesn’t set the cost of a traffic ticket. However, having the ability to decide whether or not to give them out for jaywalking becomes a problem for those who do receive tickets. Students aren’t the only ones affected; as penalties for jaywalking become harsher and more strictly enforced, they can become expensive for who don’t have the means to pay them.
“They very adversely affect low-income folks who sometimes simply can’t afford the ticket,” Moore said. “While I think that using tickets as a way of promoting safety is sensible and consistent with traffic engineering practice, the costs of tickets in Los Angeles are counterproductive, because if you can’t pay the ticket, it has no deterrent effect.”
The South Traffic Division isn’t the only area in Los Angeles where LAPD has been stepping up its efforts to prevent jaywalking. Vision Zero Los Angeles, a joint program of the Mayor’s Office, LAPD and the L.A. Department of Transportation, was implemented this year in an attempt to bring down the number of traffic-related deaths in the city to zero by 2025. According to the project’s website, 44 percent of all traffic-related deaths and severe injuries in the city involve people walking or bicycling, and the majority — 65 percent — of these accidents occur in what the city calls the “High Injury Network,” or areas of intense traffic activity, a designation that includes the University Park area.
Moving forward
In an attempt to combat pedestrian-related collisions, Vision Zero has been targeting its education and enforcement efforts around these High Injury Networks, which comprise only 6 percent of the city’s streets. So far in 2015, LAPD officers have handed out more than 13,000 traffic citations downtown, according to the Los Angeles Times; around the University, there have been over 4,500, Kowalski said.
Responses to this enforcement method have been mixed. Though some, such as Anderson, believe existing laws prohibiting pedestrians from starting to cross after the countdown begins should be changed, others see it as a necessary safety enforcement method.
“I think it should stay the same; I think it’s a fair law,” said Armando Vildosola, a junior majoring in business administration. “Wait another two minutes and make life easier for the drivers — and probably safer for pedestrians.”
And some, such as Moore are caught between the two — believing that the law is necessary but that its enforcement is flawed.
“The stakes are very high in those collisions,” Moore said. “The pedestrians tend to lose, so I think it’s sensible to err on the side of conservatism and keep the current policy in place. But the question of how high the fine should be is a separate one, and there I think that there should definitely be a change.”
So to combat people getting hit by cars, police are ticketing people who are crossing with the light and full right of way because a traffic engineer doesn’t know how athletic they are? That makes a lot of sense. The point of a countdown timer is that it gives the pedestrian information on how much time is left to cross. The rule made a certain sense before crossing lights had timers because you couldn’t know if the light was about to change or not. But with a timer, the rule is useless.
How about police spend their time policing the thing that hits and kills people. Sit at any of the intersections where they’re ticketing pedestrians and you will see one car after another speed, run red lights, block cross walks, turn right on red in front of pedestrians, etc. Streets don’t belong to cars and it is not everyone’s responsibility to scurry around to avoid delaying them for a tenth of a second. Streets are for people.
Stupid law. Getting across before the counter runs down should be the standard. Another classic civic shakedown under the guise of safety.
Totally agree!
Why doesn’t the LAPD ticket the people who jet out in front of traffic on La Brea??? I’ll tell you why: the common perception is USC students are made of money so they can afford the tickets! Why aren’t they stepping the same “efforts” up in Westwood???!!!   I smell profiling!!

A new class next semester looks to bridge the gap between the real world and the virtual.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has recently announced it is offering a new class next spring, “ASCJ 420: Dynamics of the Mobile Revolution,” taught by Flint Dille, an alumnus of the School of Cinematic Arts. Dille, a screenwriter, game designer and novelist, is best known for his work in Transformers, G.I. Joe, Dead to Rights and his own book, The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design.
Dille’s class will explore how storytellers and media professionals are surviving the media revolution and how they can continue to grow through the use of gamification, alternate reality and geo-mobile technology. A flyer for the class says the course is “designed to help us develop methods to ensure that citizens of the not-so-distant future are engaged in meaningful decision-making and purposeful activities, re-entering the physical world after a generation of being parked in front of screens.”
Dille currently works as the creative lead on the gaming company Niantic’s geo-mobile alternate reality game, Ingress. In this alternate reality game, gamers are encouraged to get off their couches and instead venture out into the real world, meeting people and places that will allow them to unlock portals that will lead them to the next level.
“[This] is going to a be a very different reality than most of us grew up in,” he said. “You have to put on virtual reality goggles, which I think we all know are coming, and [the experience] you have will be more and more distinguishable to real experiences. At the same time, the real world is going to change, adapt to new times, so it will be a different place and people will be making much more conscious choices of what they let into and what they let out of their lives.”
When Dille finished his undergraduate degree in ancient history and rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, his father encouraged him to follow his interests because the world was changing so much that, down the road, he would probably end up in a job that, at the moment, didn’t exist. Just like his father predicted, Dille ended up working in the gaming industry, something that no one could have predicted at that time. Given his experience, he wants this class to prepare USC students for jobs that don’t exist in the market yet.
“The whole idea is to explore what all the possibilities are and try to project them,” he said. “Frankly, to create the world that is coming. This is your world — you’re students, you’re going to be creating it, so we might as well give you a head start on it.”
Though it’s difficult to prepare for jobs that are nonexistent, Dille believes there are basic fundamental skills that are needed to survive in the changing world of communication. Dille’s class will experiment and test the boundaries of what is coming next to prepare students for the unknown future.
“Then there’s other kinds of explorations we constantly have to do so that when the moment comes, when technology is right, when the market is right, when the world is right, you can all of a sudden do something really exciting,” he said.
By the end of the semester, students will have worked on a substantive project and will publish a digital book of their findings. According to the syllabus, student papers will not only be considered for a grade, but will instead become part of a meaningful body of work that will be useful in the future.
Francesca Smith, a research fellow at the Annenberg Innovation Lab who works closely with Dille, said that his past experiences in the entertainment industry alone make the class worthwhile.
“Fortunately, [Flint] has the perspective of being on the cutting edge and being able to see what is coming up and what is unfolding,” she said. “He’s a wonderful and insightful person. He’s a USC alumnus, so he brings together this wonderful combination of representing the Trojan community, the media and entertainment industry in traditional Hollywood as well as the more creative side of things.”

The Undergraduate Student Government, Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Panhellenic Council and Women’s Student Assembly partnered with the program Elect Her to host a workshop on Thursday evening geared toward training women to run for student government positions. The event, which was held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, also sought to increase interest among women in becoming public officeholders in the future.
Elect Her is a national program co-sponsored by the American Association of University Women and Running Start, both women’s advocacy organizations that seek to narrow the political gender gap by empowering more women to run for public offices, including student government. According to its website, Elect Her has hosted 50 student workshops at different colleges this year, with 76 percent of participants who reported running for positions becoming elected.
USG President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler spoke first, discussing some of their personal campaign experiences while maintaining an interactive discussion with attendees.
Monica Garcia, a councilmember in the City of Baldwin Park and a USC alumna, gave the keynote presentation. Garcia said that her experiences at USC sparked her interest in politics and that she actively worked toward running for governmental positions.
“Women bring a unique perspective and leadership style to public offices, and it’s important to make sure women are well-represented,” Garcia said.
One of the event’s topics was identifying reasons why men hold more student government offices than women.
“Politics is a small world, and often what can end up happening is male politicians sometimes create a type of ‘boys’ club,’” said Garcia.
Aisha Counts, a sophomore majoring in business administration and philosophy, politics and law, said the lack of women in leadership can be daunting to women seeking office.
“Fear of failure is always there for anyone, but there are a lot of stigmas and stereotypes that surround women especially,” Counts said. “Also, women don’t see a lot of other women in offices, and that in itself can be discouraging because of historical differences.”
Some students have observed women being treated differently than men for sharing similar characteristics.
“Oftentimes, when men are assertive, they’re seen as strong and powerful. When women are assertive, they’re seen as uptight,” said Christian Sibrian, a senior studying business administration.
Another primary message of the event had to do with building skills that empower women to win elections.
“The most important thing I learned by attending this event has to do with actually figuring out why I want to run for an office and using that passion to overcome all the challenges I’ll face,” Counts said.
Fowler emphasized the importance of self-confidence.
“Believing in yourself and your abilities can help you achieve a lot more than you think you can, so listen to yourself and support yourself,” Fowler said. “Supporting yourself makes others want to follow you, and it’s important to build real connections with people you enjoy and who believe in you to make changes.”

USC students participate in the Taste of Annenberg involvement fair. Flickr/USCAnnenberg
I was always told that going to college would be the best time of my life. So far it has definitely been wonderful, but I will have to wait for the semester to end to reach a final conclusion.
One of the main reasons this stage is so exciting is that you are at a very special age. You are old enough to do adult things but young enough not to have all the adult responsibilities. Your main duty is to study — which is no small feat but still gives you a lot of free time. But in order to make the best of this freedom, having the support of your university to explore what you are passionate about, is vital.
University is supposed to be more than classes and exams. We are not here only to find a job; we are here to find our personality and to find our own way of thinking. Facilitating this for every student is undoubtedly very hard, but, as far as I am concerned, I think that USC has managed to do it pretty well, or at least better than the universities I know of in Spain.
You are not a USC student, you are a Trojan. It all starts there. Since Owen R. Bird gave this name to the University back in 1912, a strong identity began to form. Besides a healthy habit, sports are a great educational tool, and an amazing way to unite all students to either represent or support their university. If you want to make all these people proud of the place where they study, hosting events like football games (and tailgates) is a very effective way to do it. And it’s a lot of fun, too.
However, it is not only about sports. What about this blog post? Something like this would not be possible at my Spanish university, since we do not have a newspaper. The Daily Trojan provides stories for students, made by students, and that makes it a unique newspaper. It contains articles that might not be published anywhere else.  
Another thing I love about USC (and many other American universities) is how student associations are formed. The involvement fair at the beginning of the semester was astonishing. There are also student organizations in my home university, but they do not have that as big a presence compared to those at USC. Even though students will and commitment is what really makes an association successful, infrastructure and means are needed. The more resources your university gives you, the more encouraged you will be to start up a new project.
I think that one of the reasons why extracurricular activities are more popular here is because universities are larger in every sense (everything in the United States is XL size as compared to Europe ,and universities are no exception). These huge institutions normally have more resources, too. We can never forget that education is not an expense but an investment. However, I think the success of extracurricular clubs and organizations is due to perspective and strategy, too, and I will try to bring some of that back to Spain.

Jumpman · Junior running back Justin Davis is the Trojans second leaing rusher this season behind freshman Ronald Jones II. Davis has carried the ball 99 times for 505 yards and five touchdowns. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
After both teams got off to slow starts, USC will head to Eugene where both the Ducks and the Trojans will put a four-game winning streak on the line. No. 24 USC and No. 23 Oregon are both 7-3 overall and 5-2 in conference. Last week, while the Trojans barely escaped a loss in Boulder, the Ducks upset Stanford 38-36.
Oregon quarterback Vernon Adams fractured his finger in the team’s season opener and his injury may be to blame for his team’s shaky start. Since Adams regained his health, however, the Ducks are 4-0 and look a lot like their former selves. The team is averaging 42.3 points and 538.5 total yards during their win streak.
“This is going to be about points,” interim head coach Clay Helton said. “It always is with Oregon. A lot of pressure this week is going to be on our offense.”
Helton emphasized the importance of scoring points against an Oregon team that wins by scoring a lot of points in a short amount of time. The Ducks are especially dangerous on the ground, boasting the No. 4 rushing offense in the nation, tallying 2,974 yards on the ground this season alone.
The Trojan defense will have its hands full with the explosive Oregon defense, and will be without freshman linebacker Cam Smith, who had three interceptions against Utah. Smith suffered a season-ending knee injury at Colorado. Sophomore Uchenna Nwosu, who typically plays outside linebacker, has moved to inside linebacker to cover for Smith’s absence.
“They told me, ‘We need you to play inside. Cam’s down, Lamar’s down. We need some help,’” Nwosu said.
On offense, Helton has the Pac-12’s leader in pass efficiency to help him execute his plan to put a lot of points on the board. Redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler and his favorite target, sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, will face a defense that has given up a little more than 317 yards per game and 31 passing touchdowns this season. While the Trojans have previously depended on a slowed down tempo that grinds out points on the ground, they’ll rely a lot on Kessler’s arm on Saturday.
Kessler will have to face more than just the Oregon defense, however. Autzen Stadium is known to draw a packed house and throw opposing quarterbacks off their game with extremely loud cheering. Kessler, however, said he doesn’t let the crowd phase him.
“But you kind of feed off it sometimes,” Kessler said. “It’s fun to have them yell at you and then you make a play and it goes quiet. And then they make a play, and it gets loud again. It’s kind of back and forth. That’s what you expect in road games.”
As for Smith-Schuster, a Biletnikoff Award semifinalist, he will be facing a team he almost ended up playing for. The sophomore wide receiver had decided to play for the Ducks, but changed his mind just days before signing day to stay closer to his home in Long Beach.
“All those [defensive backs] I saw there, I’m going against them this Saturday, so it will be a lot of fun to play against them,” Smith-Schuster said.
A win for USC would mean only a win over UCLA separates them from a Pac-12 South title. Oregon would need a win over the Trojans and for Cal to upset Stanford this weekend to be competitive for the Pac-12 North title.
The game is set for 12:30 p.m. on Saturday at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon.
Not gonna happen, Trojans.  You will be run out of the building tomorrow.  Not enough speed, not enough toughness.  Always fun beating USC.  Again!

It’s hard to believe that this is actually my last column as sports editor of this publication. For the past year, I’ve had the privilege of fully immersing myself in USC athletics, and time sure does fly when you’re having fun.
Going into last January, I remember saying that I wanted my tenure as sports editor to be as intriguing as possible, and now that it’s almost over, I realize that’s exactly what I got and more.
I’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly from the majority of the 21 intercollegiate sports that USC has to offer. Women’s sand volleyball notching a perfect season on their way to a national title, the football program capturing one of the nation’s best recruiting classes and baseball returning to the postseason for the first time in a decade were a few of the positive highlights that I had the fortune of seeing firsthand last spring.
Then came the storm of the fall, which has already featured a 22-match winning streak by the No. 1-ranked women’s volleyball team, a thrilling NCAA tournament game win on penalty kicks by women’s soccer and the mid-season revival of the football team under the leadership of interim head coach Clay Helton. I don’t want to get too ahead of myself, but a Pac-12 Championship game would truly be the icing on the cake.
Last but not least, a copy of the Oct. 13 issue of the DT hangs in the sports office. In bold, the headline on the front page reads “Coach Steve Sarkisian fired.”  Every time, I take a glance at the front page, it brings back memories of a story within the story. On the surface, the story discusses the termination of Sarkisian, just a day after he was asked by Athletic Director Pat Haden to take a leave of absence for health reasons that turned out to derive from alleged alcoholism. Putting my journalistic duties aside, though, I saw a man whose life unraveled publicly in the most unfortunate of ways.
Something I’ve always considered when writing is that student-athletes, coaches and administrators are all human, too. For that reason, I never wanted to be the one that absolutely bashed a coach or dug up dirt on a group of players. First and foremost, I always aimed to maintain my integrity and relationships, whether that be with coaches, players or sports information directors.
Call it a learning experience, but I just look back at all of the mistakes I’ve made during my time as sports editor. I’ve misspelled words, messed up headlines, misidentified players in photos and made a few inaccurate predictions here and there. As a perfectionist, those errors always killed me. In effect, I owned up to those missteps and took the criticism, whether it be in public or private, just like any coach or player would if they made a wrong decision or played poorly. But at the end of the day, we move on because there’s almost always another game to be played in the near future or, in my case, another paper to be put out the next day.
There’s no doubt in my mind that this position has helped me grow into the person I am today. The sports section has taught me so much, both internally and externally.
I’m just hoping that when someone picked up the paper each day, or read online or on social media, they learned something new or were moved by a certain story, thought or opinion.
The great amount of power sports carry is indisputable, but words only further strengthen them and have the ability to bring them to life in ways one could never imagine. That’s what I’ve been trying to accomplish when I put my head down and start pitching stories, writing or editing every day.
I ‘ve got a couple issues left, but I just wanted to take the time to say thank you.
Thank you to all of the student-athletes, coaches, sports information directors, athletic department administrators, mentors and, last but not least, my writers. Without y’all, this section wouln’t be possible.
It may sound like I’m about to sign off for the last time, but don’t worry, I’ll be back. It’s not goodbye, it’s see you later.

The No. 4 USC men’s water polo team ended the regular season losing three of its last four games, though the Trojans can redeem themselves with a strong performance in the upcoming MPSF tournament held Friday through Sunday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
USC will kick off the tournament facing No. 5 Stanford on Friday. Semifinals will be played on Saturday and the championship on Sunday. The winner of the tournament will receive an automatic bid in the NCAA Tournament on Dec. 5 and 6.
“It’s been a quick season,” junior Blake Edwards said before practice on Tuesday. “We’ve covered a lot this season. This week there’s not too much work that needs to be done. Just about putting everything together.”
The Men of Troy are 2-1 against the Cardinal in three matches this season. They lost to Stanford 6-5 in the NorCal Tournament on Sept. 20, but beat them in a regular season match in overtime 12-8 on Oct. 3 at home. A week later, they won 9-6 over the Cardinal in the SoCal Invitational Semifinal.
USC is familiar with what Stanford brings to the table.
“We played them three times already this year” said sophomore driver Grant Stein. “We know what to look for. We’ve already prepared for everything. We’re re-watching our videos, going through their center plays, what they do on offense, what they do on defense. I think we’ll be ready for it.”
In order to win the MPSF, USC will likely have to get past the three teams ranked ahead of them: UCLA, Pacific and Cal. Coincidentally, the Trojans’ last three losses have come against those teams, including a rough 11-6 defeat in Westwood on Sunday.
The Trojans will have to put all that behind them and focus on the grueling weekend ahead.
“We take what our coach is telling us, and we keep saying ‘next play,’” Stein said. “We forget about the past. We learn from our mistakes in the past — what we did wrong and what we can do better. We use that to our advantage going into future games.”
Edwards noted they were able to take away some good from the losses.
“We have to put it behind us,” he said. “Unfortunately we haven’t been in much form lately but we have gained a lot of positives out of each game. We’ve actually learned quite a lot from the losses.”
Last season, the Trojans finished fourth in the MPSF Tournament, losing to Stanford in the semifinal and UCLA in the third place game. That tournament was held in Long Beach; this year’s will be at USC, giving the Trojans a distinct advantage over the nine visiting teams.
Still, playing three games in three days will be a challenge.
“It’s definitely going to be tiring,” Stein said. “These are three of the most important games of the season. There’s definitely going to be a high pace. Lots of hard work is going to be needed to win.”
The tournament kicks off at 8:30 a.m. on Friday with a play-in game between UC Irvine and San Jose State and will end with the championship match on Sunday at 4:30 p.m. USC will square off against Stanford at 11:30 a.m. on Friday.

The women’s volleyball team begins its final road trip of the regular season on Friday, as it takes on No. 23 Arizona in Tucson before heading to Tempe for a clash against No. 24 Arizona State. The No. 1 Women of Troy are back atop the national rankings after a perfect home stand, and they look to pick up more momentum on the road before returning home Thanksgiving week to play rivals California and UCLA.
In the stretch run of a grueling season, the squad will be challenged both physically and mentally in the coming matches, and junior setter Alice Pizzasegola said the team has to stay sharp.
“We need to be focused and stay focused,” she said. “It’s easy to lose your focus on the road … but we need to stay with it till the end.”
Endurance may, indeed, prove to be key, as this season’s race to the Pac-12 summit remains neck-and-neck between the USC and Washington, who ruined the Women of Troy’s perfect season last month in Seattle. The Huskies lie just one game behind USC with two matches to play.
This makes the end of the regular season pivotal for the Women of Troy, starting with their journey to the desert. USC beat the Wildcats, 3-1, in a tightly contested match earlier in the year at the Galen Center. Head coach Mick Haley and his team have not lost to Arizona since the 2013 season, but that match ended with Arizona knocking off the then-No. 1 Women of Troy in Tucson.
Haley also pointed out that the Wildcats would have an extra incentive on Friday, needing to beat both USC and UCLA to force their way into the NCAA tournament.
“They need to beat us, and we have to be ready to accept that challenge,” he said.
Arizona currently sits at 7-9 in conference play and at 17-11 overall, but they remain in the top 25 and have played well at home. The Wildcats are 9-4 at the McKale Center this season, and three of those four losses came against teams that now find themselves in the top 10: Washington, Texas and Stanford.
Two days after their match in Tucson, the Trojans head north to take on the Sun Devils. No. 24 Arizona State sits one place below its in-state rivals in the national rankings but actually has a better season record of 19-8 (8-8 in Pac-12 play). The Sun Devils have had an up-and-down season, which makes them formidable opponents on the wrong day, a fact Haley was all too familiar with.
“For the last, seems like, 10 years, it’s been a five-set match [in Tempe],” he said. “They really feel like they can beat us.”
Haley won his 900th victory as a Division I coach the last time USC played Arizona State, as the Women of Troy sent the Sun Devils packing in four sets at the Galen Center. Like the Wildcats, however, ASU has looked more comfortable at home and sports a stellar 12-1 season mark at the Wells Fargo Center.
Whether the match is in the Galen Center or in Tempe, the Trojans will be ready.
“[We want] to make a strong statement,” Pizzasegola said. “Yeah, we’re good at home, but we’re good on the road, too.”
With two highly anticipated rivalry clashes looming in the distance, USC’s final, pivotal regular season road trip will not be an easy one. But with every away match, Pizzasegola said, comes an extra incentive.
“If we win 3-0, 3-0 on the road, we get ice cream,” she said. “So that’s the goal: getting ice cream.”
Friday’s match against Arizona begins at 6 p.m., and Sunday’s match at Arizona State starts at     1 p.m.
There are four matches remaining in the conference schedule not two. Is it that hard to look up the schedule??

Author Erin Siedemann opens her new memoir, Postcards from the Sky: Adventures of an Aviatrix with “I am an unlikely traveler.” She isn’t wrong. In fact, Siedemann is part of an elite group — female pilots.
As I was reading her book, I was shocked to find out that only 6 percent of pilots around the world today are female. It is definitely one of the most gender-segregated professions in America which comes with a fair amount of misogyny and discrimination. Siedemann’s firsthand, incredibly funny and endearing memoir tells the unlikely story of how she fell in love with flying and navigated being part of such a small minority.
I was immediately drawn into this book from the second page, when Seideman explains how she didn’t fall in love with being on an airplane from her very first flight. In fact, far from it — she spent her teenage years hating commercial flights and suffering from terrible airsickness. This is something I know all too well. I am an incredibly nervous flier, which seems a little ridiculous given that I chose to study abroad in one of the farthest possible countries from my home in England. This means I have to grit my teeth and board the
12-hour flight between London and L.A. at least four times a year, in spite of my nerves. I’ve always felt uncomfortable being so far above earth and have certainly dealt with airsickness from time to time as well.
However, I differ from Siedemann in one crucial aspect: I hate the feeling of complete powerlessness when I’m on an airplane, but as a pilot, Siedemann is able to be in control. I hoped that by seeing the inside life of a pilot I would begin to gain a greater understanding of aviation which would in turn assuage some of my own fears. I was not disappointed.
Siedemann recalls how her love of flying developed when, at 17, she was able to fly on a small airplane just outside her hometown of New Orleans. She did not fall in love with the sensation of being on an airplane or technicalities of flying; instead, she was in awe of the ability to see a new world and some of the incredible beauty of earth from the sky in a small span of time. This was definitely something I could relate to. My family is made up of great travelers — my grandpa moved to England from Australia and my grandma from Norway. My father lived in Poland and Israel before coming to London, and my aunt moved to France to marry and have children. I definitely can appreciate wanderlust — having traveled frequently with my family, I have been lucky enough to see some amazing sights from airplanes. I will never forget flying over the Grand Canyon, the islands of Hawaii, the fjords of Norway and, probably my all time favorite, the English countryside and London the first time I came home from college for the holidays. There is something about seeing the world from above that allows me to appreciate it in a completely different and spectacular way.
So by this time in the book it’s safe to say I was hooked — and this was only a few pages in — and I continued to enjoy every page afterward. Siedemann has an incredible talent for writing in an accessible way. Though this is her first book, she isn’t new to writing. She graduated cum laude from Loyola University New Orleans with a degree in English Writing, and during her time as a pilot has written for many blogs.  She tells hilarious stories about the ups and downs of learning to fly an aircraft, falling in love with her flight instructor and many other subjects.
However, intertwined with the comedy and the sweet stories, Siedemann discusses something that really makes this book resonate and gives it the weight that it needs to make it such a worthwhile read. She discusses the difficulties of being a female pilot in a male dominated sphere. The flight instructor she falls in love with is incredibly prejudiced against her decision to pursue such a typically male profession. The misogyny she competes against is shocking and seemingly endless. It is sad to think that in a society we all like to think of as being
open-minded, women are still being openly and brazenly criticized for their career choices.
All in all, Siedemann does an excellent job at dispelling any prejudice that exists for women in the aviation industry. She takes the reader through an incredible journey of flight, its perks, its difficulties and ultimately, why seeing the world from above is both a thrill and a pleasure.

Cerina Epple, a junior majoring in economics, regards her Instagram account, @CerinaEpple, as a way to express herself and update her friends and family on what’s going on in her life. Whether she’s running half marathons, lending a helping hand to the people of Ghana, trying out new coffee shops or just hanging out with her friends, Epple captures her meaningful life. Nevertheless, she acknowledges the negative effects of social media. Epple plans on using social media as a catalyst for positive change.
Daily Trojan: In what way do you think Instagram has impacted your life positively?
Cerina Epple: I love to stay in touch with my friends and family through Instagram. Every person’s Instagram account is a snapshot of their life story, and Instagram has allowed me to give my friends and family a glimpse of what has been happening in my life. I have always preferred updating my friends and family in person, but pictures on Instagram are a great supplement to in-person updates.
DT: There were pictures that you posted that showed your training for the Nike Women’s Half Marathon with the hashtags #Nikeplus, #Nikewomenshalf and #werunSF. You recently completed the marathon. How was the training process and the experience itself?
CE: The training process is a lot more of a mental than physical battle. For me, the hardest part about training is not the running itself but having the mental willpower to put my shoes on and go. Many people want to know the best marathon training tips, but my best tip is to just get outdoors and run. And once you start running, don’t stop! The actual race day was an incredible experience. It was really empowering running with over 20,000 women who were so strong inside and out. The most inspiring part was seeing runners with physical handicaps finish the race. Running with them made me feel like I could overcome any challenge. Also, despite the massive amount of runners, Nike does a fantastic job of personalizing your race experience. I am already excited to run again next year!
DT: You have traveled extensively across the globe, including to Hawaii and Ghana. What does traveling mean to you?
CE: I saw this quote on Pinterest the other day and it goes like this: “The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” I really believe that traveling enables us to not only see new landscapes, but it also gives us new eyes to see our lives. Whenever I travel somewhere and come back home, I feel like I have been given a new perspective and a new measure of self-awareness. A great part of traveling is coming home afterwards and sharing that new perspective with people around you. Traveling is also addictive because when I travel, I realize how much I have yet to learn about the world and I feel inspired to travel more.
DT: Your mission trip to Ghana was one of the most memorable experiences of your life. Can you tell us what your most life-changing moment from the trip was?
CE: The most life-changing experience in Ghana was spending time with the children at the Amazing Grace School near Kumase. Materially, the children have so much less than many of us in the U.S., but I have seen that they also have something much more valuable than any material possession that we have — they have immeasurable amounts of joy. It is hard to be satisfied in the U.S. where we are taught to always strive for more — more money, more things, more work, more success. Ghanaian children may not have much, but they are extremely joyful and thankful for what they do have. I would argue that their posture of gratitude and joy also allows them to give generously and love people better than I’ve seen anyone love. Experiencing the hospitality and kindness the Ghanaian children had was so humbling and compelled me to live a more joyful and generous life.
DT: Many people feel that social media is unhealthy and leads to depression, jealousy and bitterness. What is your take on this?
CE: I agree that social media does have its negative effects on people, and I agree that it can lead to depression, jealousy and bitterness. Many times social media —especially Instagram — showcases a false image of what life is. Many high profile Instagrammers have actually been speaking out lately on the dehumanizing effects of these “glamorized” Instagram profiles.
DT: What are some of your future plans and goals?
CE: One of my goals for this school year is to be an advocate for change at USC and at universities across the nation. I’m seeing firsthand how racism is still a horrible reality, and rather than jumping to solutions, I want to encourage people to begin taking the time to listen to the minority voices on our campus and engaging in race conversations. I know that these conversations are uncomfortable, but these conversations will lead to understanding, and this understanding will lead to effective change.

As anti-refugee hysteria intensifies, the intolerability of life in Syria, a country racked with civil war and political unrest, has yet to make a recent headline. Instead, however, Syrian refugees fleeing persecution, torture and death have been criminalized by the media and riddled with poor, makeshift living conditions. Despite the mass call to subjugate an already displaced population, an Undergraduate Student Government resolution introduced last Tuesday seeks to renew the U.S. commitment to human rights by providing refuge and a top-tier education to Syrian students. If passed, USC will be joining the Syria Consortium of the Institution for International Education along with universities such as Brown University and Colorado State University. And during one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the 21st century, the University has a unique opportunity to be on the right side of history by unanimously passing the proposed resolution.
Graduate student Christopher Lo-Records introduced the resolution, stating that many universities have an open door policy for Syrian scholars. In his presentation, he also noted that the practice of taking in refugees has been done before for refugees from Nicaragua, Iraq, Cuba and Vietnam.
It is even more important to provide refuge for Syrian students given the widespread, and largely unfounded, backlash against refugees. Most of this stems from fear as a result of recent Paris attacks — which many politicians quickly capitalized on as an opportunity to fuel anti-immigrant sentiments. Therefore, it is important to note that, when compared to Europe, the U.S. vetting process for refugees is far more scrupulous, and subsequently more selective, according to the State Department. According to Lo-Records, the vetting process is particularly extensive and has taken in 750,000 refugees since 9/11 without any threats to national security.
Though many assume that asylum is simply an incubator for ISIS recruitment, of the eight identified perpetrators of the recent Paris attacks, none are Syrian refugees; in fact, all of the suspects are European nationals who have resided in either France or Belgium for years. French officials have stated that, while one Syrian passport was found, it did not belong to a refugee, but rather a loyalist soldier who died a few months ago in the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Using 9/11 as an analog, the use of fake passports is a commonplace practice for terrorists. Nevertheless, the association between refugees and ISIS still creates anti-refugee sentiment. This type of ignorance stems from a genuine misunderstanding of ISIS, a transnational actor better identified as a global network than an Islamic State. Evidently, it is clear that refugees are nothing more than victims and survivors of terrorism, as they themselves have been witnesses to some of the most heinous ISIS attacks. By leaving Syria, these refugees show a genuine rejection of fundamentalism and terrorism altogether. In reality, terrorist networks like ISIS are what these refugees are fleeing from, not who these refugees are.
Providing Syrian refugees with an education and a stable living space can do much to rectify the University’s image with respect to diversity issues. And considering the recent call for diversity on campus, passing this resolution could create a unique opportunity for the University to embrace and foster an evolving definition of diversity on this campus.

Transportation, housing, food, clothing, heating, … none of these are free. What will the Undergraduate Student Government not do to pay for these expenses of the refugees? Is it not a fraud to collect monies for one purpose only to spend them somewhere else?

Education is without a doubt one of the most important issues to Angelenos right now. And with the intent of many challenging existing programs to create ones which foster higher enrollment, graduation and retention rates, it is no surprise that the Los Angeles Unified Board of Education reviewed a report earlier this week which considers the conversion of the LAUSD system into an all-charter district. According to the California Charter Schools Association, “74 percent of voters living within the Los Angeles Unified School District support the expansion of charter public schools in neighborhoods where existing schools are struggling.”
The report, pioneered by the Eli and Edythe Broad foundation, proposes a $490 million plan that would work toward enrolling more than half the district’s students in 260 newly added charter schools over the next eight years, according to the Los Angeles Times. This addition of more charter schools will undoubtedly reinvigorate LAUSD’s heavily unionized broken public schooling system by emphasizing the importance of parent choice and accountability over school programming. For the charter school system, what doesn’t work gets fixed. This is how LAUSD and other California school districts alike can face less risk and get better results.
For the past few years, charter schools — independently run, public and non-union schools — seek to create greater accountability by establishing a charter that lists specific target area goals for performance achievement and methods of assessment. The schools are known for their inclusivity and flexibility in operating without the jurisdictions mandated by public schools. According to studies released by the CCSA, “67 percent of California’s charter schools met student achievement targets on state tests in the 2009-2010 school year compared to just 57 percent of non-charter schools.”
But opponents of an all-charter LAUSD district are concerned about its fiscal impact, stating their concern that the increase of charter schools could threaten the district with bankruptcy. Opponents and proponents of charter schools are working rapidly to compose proposals which highlight either the educational benefits or educational disadvantages and economically harmful repercussions an all-charter school district could create. California statewide law, however, requires that school systems must approve charter schools despite financial impact. So the clock is ticking. Union supporters who oppose charter expansion have also made plans to create a proposal which would require charter schools to provide information regarding salary, available services to disabled students and actions against the schools, according to the L.A Times. They also argue that investing resources in charter schools strips funding for traditional schools, as students would migrate from public schooling to charter programs.
“A closer look at many of the naysayers’ complaints about the plan reveal not so much anger about billionaire involvement in education, but envy that Broad doesn’t want his largess to go to the traditional public schools,” Larry Sand, president of the California Teachers Empowerment Network, noted in the Los Angeles Daily News. “But why would he do that? Those schools receive plenty of money. The official per-pupil spending in L.A. is $13,490, far more than the national average.”
In 2013, the California Teachers Empowerment Network poll found that 82 percent of teachers favor the existence of charter schools, while only 18 percent opposed. The greatest perceived benefit for charter schools is the fact that they have separate funding from traditional schools, allowing more flexibility. But in order for the proposal to pass it would need to overcome a board vote, the respective school districts would also need more than half of its teachers to sign a petition in favor of the change in addition to laying out alternative choices for students who would like to opt out of the charter school program. Tom Torlakson, state superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education, is also required to separately approve petitions for all-charter districts, according to the L.A. Times.

The college football season is quickly drawing to a close, but fear not, fans, we’ve got plenty of good matchups to tide us over until bowl season. With Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State each playing teams of consequence and finally getting to the backloaded schedules of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU and Baylor, we should have some College Football Playoff elimination answers, or at least a clearer view of what potential chaos is left. 
Now that you’ve seen our predictions, here are some matchups to keep an eye on this weekend:
No. 9 Michigan State at No. 3 Ohio State (Spread: -4)
In the Big Ten, Michigan State heads to Columbus this weekend for what is essentially the Big 10 Championship semifinal (the winner of this matchup will be in prime position to face the Big Ten West winner). Ohio State comes in with a 23-game win streak versus Michigan State, but hasn’t faced a ranked opponent all season. Michigan State’s two wins over ranked teams this year looks marginally better, though both wins were very close (A win against Oregon while Vernon Adams was injured and, of course, the win against Michigan on blocked punt).
Both teams have looked very impressive and unimpressive at times this season. The Buckeyes’ 28-3 road win at Illinois wasn’t an extremely dominant performance, but a win’s a win. Ohio State’s season has been defined by moments of greatness thanks in large part to spectacular individual players. Buckeye running back Ezekiel Elliott has racked up 15 straight games with over 100 yards rushing. But if last season is any indication, this team is definitely capable of a lot more. For Ohio State to keep its playoff dreams alive, they’re going to have to show that they’re the real deal this weekend.
Michigan State has had a similar kind of season, although their dreams of a perfect season have been dashed thanks in large part to a call that went in Nebraska’s favor. The Spartans were able to bounce back against Maryland, but it may have come at a price. Quarterback Connor Cook suffered a shoulder injury. It didn’t look good at first, but he’s cleared to play this weekend. It will be interesting to see if his injury will have a significant impact on the game.
Our model has Ohio State slightly favored but this one really could go either way.
No. 10 Baylor at No. 6 Oklahoma State (Spread: -3)
This week in Pac-12 schadenfreude: by the end of the weekend, every team in the Big 12 could have a loss. Alright, now that I’ve gotten that out of my system, let’s take a look at this matchup.
Oklahoma State’s dream of an undefeated season almost came undone last weekend against Iowa State. Trailing throughout the game, Oklahoma State was able to rally in the fourth-quarter to keep their dream of a playoff spot alive.
That’s no longer the case for Baylor after last week’s loss to Oklahoma. After two solid games, Baylor freshman quarterback Jarrett Stidham struggled against Oklahoma and threw two interceptions. Granted, he was playing with a back injury for most of a game that clearly limited his mobility and the playbook. 
Fortunately for Baylor fans, Stidham is expected to play this weekend, which means Baylor is very much still in this game. Baylor and Oklahoma State have similar defensive stats (around 400 yards allowed per game, 230 passing/170 rushing), but Baylor runs a much more potent offense, averaging 638 yards per game to Oklahoma State’s 500 yards. The Bears defense has struggled in past weeks, but if Baylor can get going offensively they have a shot at showing that they’re still a force to be reckoned with. Our model favors Oklahoma but ESPN’s FPI gives Baylor a 61.6 percent chance to win. Long story short, if you like points, you’ll like this matchup.
No. 18 TCU at No. 7 Oklahoma (Spread: -6 )
It goes without saying that this Big 12 matchup also has playoff implications, but it also is a perfect example of how teams can quickly rise and fall throughout the season. After spending the better part of the year near the top of the rankings, TCU is now trying to just stay afloat. While Oklahoma, after dropping a game against Texas, has come roaring back.
Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield has been playing lights-out this season. Last weekend against Baylor, Mayfield threw for 270 yards, ran for 76 yards and scored four touchdowns (If fist pumps were a statistic, he would also be leading the league).
Quarterback Trevone Boykin and wideout Josh Doctson — two of the nation’s most exceptional talents — are both questionable with injuries. We have some breaking news coming in… Oh, what’s that? Doctson is out for the season?!  Ouch, things are looking quite grim for TCU. This bad news is even worse when you account for the fact that TCU squeaked past Kansas last week as more than a 40-point favorite. 
With TCU missing Doctson and Boykin still injured, it looks like Oklahoma is going to have an easy win against TCU. To continue with the schadenfreude theme, a blowout win for Oklahoma could end up hurting the Big 12’s chances of getting into the college football playoffs. Well, at least the Pac-12 isn’t the only conference cannibalizing itself.
No. 24 USC at No. 23 Oregon (Spread: 4)
It is rather strange to think that only a few weeks ago this matchup, between two Pac-12 heavyweights, would have been ignored by many. Welcome to the weird and wild Pac-12 — a conference seemingly determined to eat itself alive. But hey, at least we’re ranked again, right?
With their upset of Stanford, it appears Oregon is starting to return to its normal self. After missing two games in the beginning of October due to injury, quarterback Vernon Adams has led Oregon to four-straight wins. Against Stanford, Adams put on a clinic, throwing for 205 yards and two touchdowns on only 12 pass attempts. But despite Oregon’s offensive prowess, their defense is still incredibly porous. The Oregon defense has allowed almost 500 yards and 37 points per game. While the Oregon defense is extremely porous, USC’s defense is also looking pretty thin at this point in the season. Starting middle linebacker Cameron Smith, a true freshman, and senior middle linebacker Lamar Dawson each will miss the rest of the season due to injuries suffered against Colorado, while guard Viane Talamaivao is questionable with a torn meniscus. USC’s secondary needs to be able to cover Oregon’s wide receivers with minimal safety help, as the injury-stricken front seven need to be able to stop Oregon’s run game that has averaged almost 300 yards per game. Our model has us as a slight favorite, which matches ESPN’S FPI predictions but differs from Vegas. I wish I could tell you what this means but either way, expect a high-scoring game this weekend.
