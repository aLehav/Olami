For the last two seasons, the USC women’s water polo team has made a living atop the polls as the No. 1 team in the nation, defeating — and sometimes, obliterating — every opponent in its path and running the show in all of collegiate water polo. After an undefeated 2016 campaign that culminated in the program’s fifth-ever NCAA National Championship last May, the Trojans were still riding high. They carried that momentum over into 2017, rattling off 25 more consecutive wins to set a new national women’s collegiate water polo record of 52 consecutive victories in the process.
However, as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.
In a highly anticipated matchup between the nation’s best earlier this month, the then-No. 1 Trojans ran into a tough Stanford squad at home and could not find the offensive firepower needed to keep their streak alive, falling to the Cardinal by a score of 12-8 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. It was the team’s first loss since falling to Stanford in the 2015 NCAA semifinal.
USC went exactly 700 days between losses, from May 9, 2015 to April 8, 2017 — a remarkable feat in a sport that is so top-heavy with the likes of perennial water polo powers Stanford, UCLA and Cal competing for national championships year-in, year-out.
If one knows anything about USC water polo, it’s that you can never count out a team coached by Jovan Vavic. Vavic, who is in his 23rd year at the helm of both the USC men’s and women’s water polo programs, is one of the most successful coaches in the history of the sport. With 14 national championships under his belt and a near .800 career winning percentage, a loss in the middle of the season isn’t enough to push the panic button. Instead, it’s merely a bump in the road toward something greater: winning back-to-back national titles.
So, what do Vavic and the Trojans want to do now? It’s simple: Start a new streak.
“That streak itself was such a huge accomplishment, and it’s nice that our hard work resulted in something big,” senior captain Avery Peterson said. “But our main goal isn’t to extend a winning streak — it’s much bigger than that. We want to win another national championship and bring it back home to USC.”
Despite the setback, USC remains one of the best teams in the nation. The team boasts a number of offensive weapons that make up the MPSF’s top-scoring team with 15.92 goals per game, led by senior driver and 2016 Peter J. Cutino Award winner Stephania Haralabidis’ 73 goals on the season. In fact, every Trojan starter has scored at least 10 goals this year, with 13 different Trojan players reaching double-digits in 2017. Haralabidis, who delivered a whopping nine-goal outing earlier this season, currently stands second all-time in program history with 258 career goals. She is joined by twin sister and fellow senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis, who is 10th all-time at USC with 167 career goals and 49 on the season.
In addition, senior All-American 2-meter Brigitta Games and star freshman utility Maud Megens have each put up 50 goals this year to tie for second on the team, while junior drivers Hayley McKelvey and Brianna Daboub have scored 30 and 29 goals, respectively, to round out the top five. Two more standout freshmen drivers, Denise Mammolito and Kelsey McIntosh, have racked up 26 and 19 goals each, while senior 2-meter Avery Peterson has also tallied 19 goals on the season.
Furthermore, a staunch defensive corps has cemented USC as one of the toughest teams in the country to score against, as the Trojans allow just 4.23 goals against per game. Part of that is attributed to Vavic’s strong goalkeeping tandem of sophomore Amanda Longan and junior Victória Chamorro, who split time in the cage. Longan, a First Team All-American, has recorded 168 saves on the season with a 10.67 saves per game average, while Chamorro, a 2016 Rio Olympian for Brazil, has tallied 92 saves and held opponents to a 3.0 goals against per game average. Furthermore, Chamorro is currently No. 6 all time at USC for career saves with 366, while Longan is right behind her at
No. 7 with 313 saves.
Longan, a team captain, has been a vocal leader for the Trojans both in and out of the pool ever since she stepped onto campus last year. She knows USC has the talent to win another title, and while the loss to Stanford wasn’t ideal, Longan believes in the makeup and resolve of her team.
“Every single time we play a game, there is something on the line,” Longan said. “So for us, we have to remember to fight and play for each other. The wins or the streak — that’s all great — but what we want to do at this point is just play for each other. Those wins will come if we play together and to our abilities.”
With a trip to Indianapolis, Ind. for the 2017 NCAA Championships on the horizon, the Trojans are ready to leave what was in the past behind and start anew with a bigger prize in mind: a sixth NCAA title for the program.

When the departed members of last year’s USC Rose Bowl-winning team were presented with their championship rings on Saturday, it was a joyous moment. It was a culmination of difficult years of sanctions, scholarship losses and vacated wins.
However, the ring ceremony also highlighted the number of star players the Trojans will need to replace this season, specifically at the wide receiver position, as both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers head off to the NFL. The loss of 2016’s top two pass catchers opens up the question of who will emerge as star redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s new favorite targets.
Saturday’s spring game at the Coliseum may have provided some clarity. With experienced receivers junior Deontay Burnett and redshirt senior Steven Mitchell Jr. out with lingering injuries along with redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, many new faces got a chance to shine on the larger stage.
“It was a really interesting thing that we had this year with JuJu and Darreus gone,” Darnold said. “We needed two new guys to step in, and I think those guys have done a really good job — the receiving corps as a whole — and I’m pretty comfortable right now honestly.”
Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
Saturday’s young group of receivers got off to a hot start during the scrimmage portion of the spring game. Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns caught two early 14-yard passes, and speedy redshirt freshman Velus Jones Jr. hauled in a difficult grab on the sideline for 21 yards as Darnold scrambled outside of the pocket.
When spring enrollee Jack Sears entered the game at quarterback, the receiving corps experienced little drop-off. Sophomore wideout Michael Pittman Jr. caught two
first-down passes from the new signal caller, showing off the size and strength that the Trojans’ coaching staff has raved about.
“We just have chemistry with all of our receivers,” Darnold said. “There are different ways to build it and learn it — different routes and stuff like that. I thought we improved on [our chemistry] today.”
USC’s receivers also showed that they can do more than just catch the ball. On a reverse play, former quarterback-turned-wideout Jalen Greene caught a screen, only to drop back for a pass. The redshirt junior then threw a perfect pass through two defenders that Jones almost caught for a touchdown, if not for a last-minute breakup by senior cornerback Jonathan Lockett. Greene, who threw a 75-yard touchdown pass in 2015, showed he can beat defenses in a variety of ways.
USC’s next reverse play attempt was more successful. After a handoff, redshirt freshman running back Vavae Malepeai pitched the ball to Jones, who took it the opposite direction, rushing for a huge 34-yard gain. The versatile Jones showed flashes of being the Trojans’ next all-purpose star, in the same vein as Joe McKnight or Adoree’ Jackson.
In the red-zone period of the spring game, Vaughns capped off the receiving corps’ excellent day with a leaping 20-yard touchdown grab while heavily covered in the end zone. He finished the afternoon with three catches for 48 yards. Pittman Jr. had three grabs for 30 yards and Greene recorded three catches for 27 yards.
“It was really nice to see a couple of playmakers like Michael Pittman Jr. and Tyler Vaughns make some nice plays in the red zone,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It was good to see Sam [Darnold] pitch and catch that first half and show great accuracy.”
While it was an all-around promising showing for the new crop of Trojan pass catchers, the group still showed some growing pains, including a couple of drops and miscommunications on routes. However with the leadership of Darnold and a full summer of team-building ahead, Helton hopes those mistakes are minimized come the fall.
“When you deal with young wideouts and they don’t run the exact right routes, [Darnold] never shows frustration,” Helton said. “He communicates and says, ‘Hey, this is what I expect from you.’ I really appreciated his maturity and leadership this spring.”

It was just a few weeks ago when I wrote a column charging the Los Angeles Dodgers’ dire need to scale the World Series hump this season.
And now, I’m back on the prowl, headhunting franchises that are deemed to be under-achieving with their above average capital and personnel. This time the Los Angeles Clippers are on the wrong end of my double-barrel shotgun of critique.
It’s time for head coach Doc Rivers and his team to make a significant postseason push, or there are going to be some notably big questions for Lob City. Well, I shouldn’t say that questions will arise. There is already plenty of concern and criticism for a Clippers franchise that historically been playoff-challenged.
As I compose this column, Los Angeles finds itself in an early hole, trailing the Utah Jazz in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, 1-0. Want to talk about a heartbreaker? The Clippers dropped Game 1 of the series to the Jazz on Saturday, 97-95. A floater from Utah guard Joe Johnson sunk through the basket as time expired in regulation to put the Clippers at a 1-0 deficit in front of their home crowd.
The painful loss this weekend makes Tuesday night’s Game 2 contest feel more and more like a must-win for the No. 4-seeded Clippers.
Unlike with the Dodgers, I must admit that my sports fandom doesn’t necessarily lie with the Clippers (regrettably, the Lakers possess my loyalty). However, as an observer of Angeleno sports, I can attest that this Clipper team is in a stagnant state.
Admittedly, it’s impossible for a front office with someone like owner Steve Ballmer to be considered stale or motionless in any sense. No doubt, the folks in the Clippers’ marketing and management team are some of the best in the league. If you haven’t had the chance to catch a Clippers game at the Staples Center, then you’re missing out. It’s safe to say that the Clippers have one of the best pre-game intro routines in the NBA; it includes an array of strobe lights, pyrotechnics and lasers bouncing around the interior of the Staples Center.
Heck, for 82 games a season, the Clippers are a pretty darn solid product on the court, too. This season saw Los Angeles clinch its fifth consecutive 50-win season — regular season consistency is not the issue. The dynamic of having Paul, a future Hall-of-Famer, steering an offense — which includes rim-rattlers like Jordan and forward Blake Griffin — is not too difficult a product to sell to fans.
But the playoffs are where the Clippers have still remained baffled as a franchise. Since arriving in 2013, Rivers has the Clippers averaging 54.3 wins per regular season. Despite the consistency from October through early April, Rivers has yet to lead the Clippers organization to its first Western Conference Finals appearance in franchise history.
There have been some close calls for breakthrough past the semifinals, but none have came to fruition. In 2015, the Clippers were just one win away from advancing to the conference finals, as they led the Houston Rockets, 3-1, in the conference semifinals. However, a meltdown proceeded and the Clippers dropped three straight games to be bounced from postseason play.
In 2013, Rivers’ Clippers team was eliminated in the conference semifinals by the Oklahoma City Thunder, 4-2.
Los Angeles has been in the playoffs each of the last five seasons. These trips to the postseason have resulted in berths to the conference semis, first round, conference semis, conference semis and first round, respectively, before being eliminated.
The most frustrating aspect of the Clippers’ postseason struggles is that you can’t quite put a finger on what the missing link is. From a distance, it’s hard to find anything significantly lacking on this Clippers roster.
For years now, there has been a consistent narrative about this team: surround the Paul-Griffin-Jordan nucleus with viable talent. Doesn’t it seem like the Clippers have done an ample job of delivering on this?
Guard J.J. Reddick is an assassin from beyond the arc. Reddick holds the single-season franchise records for 3-pointers in a season with 201. Off the bench, Los Angeles has guard Jamal Crawford at its disposal. Crawford, the only three-time winner of the Sixth Man of the Year Award in NBA history, is arguably the best role player in the league. All of this goes without mentioning Rivers, a proven NBA coach who has championship pedigree from his time with the Boston Celtics.
You have to believe that all of the pieces for a title run are there for the Clippers. This team seems to witness its full potential in flashes throughout the regular season. They’ll put together an incredible effort to top the San Antonio Spurs one night, then turn right around with a lackluster effort against the Philadelphia 76ers.
For Clippers fans, it’s hard to imagine that any regular season feat will spark buzz. It’s hard for a fanbase to crank up the hype over a 14-2 start when so many postseason shortcomings remain in the minds of Clippers loyalists.
The Clippers have a dire need to advance to the conference finals — at the least — this playoff season. Should the team encounter elimination in the conference semifinals, or earlier, the Clippers equation to success — which already seems to have all the correct variables — will become only more frustrating.

Hundreds of USC students lined up along Trousdale Parkway, waiting to file into Bovard Auditorium Monday afternoon. The students were excited to hear award-winning actress and activist Gina Rodriguez speak about women in the media, based off of her own experiences working in Hollywood.
This talk was organized by the Latina/o Student Assembly.
Rodriguez, who stars as Jane Villanueva in the television series Jane the Virgin, has advocated for increased diversity in media. During her talk, Rodriguez focused on the need for mainstream media to increase representation of people of color in film, television and print.
Rodriguez began the talk by briefly describing some of the major events and obstacles she had to overcome before landing her role on Jane the Virgin.
During this discussion, Rodriguez highlighted the significance of maintaining an optimistic and determined attitude, despite challenges. Rodriguez stressed the importance of staying focused on pursuing one’s own dreams, regardless of initial rejection or failure. Rodriguez explained that she still reminds herself to take risks and dream big.
“I am standing here, 32 years-old, having a dream of a 15-year-old, and I am not stopping until I make sure she gets all she wants,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez emphasized the idea that people should focus on their own career without worrying or comparing themselves to others.
“Success, failure, your journey, your path is yours and just yours,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez also advocated the need to continue loving and appreciating themselves, despite the internal insecurities people struggle with on a daily basis.
“The world needs all those things: self love, honoring yourself, not comparing or competing with anyone else, helping others and reminding myself that fear only exists between my two ears,” she said.
The talk later transitioned into an in-depth discussion of diversity in Hollywood and its overall effects on the perceptions and attitudes people have on the Latino community.
Based off of her own experiences and Puerto Rican background, Rodriguez described the struggle she had as a child trying to understand her dual identity as a Latina American. She explained that when she was younger she did she did not fully comprehend how or why the color of her skin would cause her to feel like she does not have a place in the movie industry.
“Growing up, I looked in the mirror and I always just saw a girl, a human being that wanted love and wanted her career to happen and wanted to be successful one day,” Rodriguez said. “I didn’t see anything different about myself.”
Rodriguez outlined ideas to instigate change. She said that Latino communities need to unify and support each other.
“Every action you make can help push forward the agenda of peace and love and empowering, and understanding the differences between our cultures, but at the same time strength in our unity,” she said. “Let me tell you, I think that’s where our future is.”
Rodriguez later discussed her admiration for the show Jane the Virgin. She said her passion for the series stems from the show’s ability to address controversial issues in a playful way, touching upon themes of sexuality, immigration and feminism.
I wanted to be a part of an art piece that was going to start conversations,” she said. “And that’s what Jane does. It talks about political commentary without judgment.”
The audience’s thrilled applause throughout the entirety of the talk reflected the enthusiasm and energy Rodriguez imparted on her listeners.
“As an aspiring actress, I really felt incredibly inspired by what Gina had to say about never giving up,” said Isabella Dake, a freshman majoring in theater. “It really made me feel empowered to follow my dreams and continue pursuing acting.”

A shooting caused street closures at Soto and Alcazar Streets and resulted in two injuries Monday morning near the Health Sciences Campus.
The shooting occurred on the 3500 block of Whiteside Street in Boyle Heights. The victims, though, were discovered just outside HSC. The victims drove to the location of the crash moments after the shooting, according to a press release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
One of the four victims of this car-to-car shooting was a 15-year-old boy, who was found with a gunshot wound in a car that had crashed into a truck, according to CBS Los Angeles. The driver suffered blunt force trauma in the crash, and two other victims were found uninjured at the scene.
The two injured victims were transported to a local hospital and were in critical but stable condition at the time of this writing.
Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that the shooting had no USC affiliation. DPS officers responded after reports came in but immediately ceded control to the Los Angeles Police Department upon arrival.
“We initially respond because it’s close to our area and offer assistance, but it was handled by [LAPD and the Sheriff’s Department],” Carlisle said.
At first, LAPD led the investigation at Soto and Alcazar streets until it was determined that the crime was committed in another location under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff’s Department. The closures led to increased traffic congestion throughout the day, according to Carlisle.
“The sheriffs are coming close to concluding their investigation at that scene,” Carlisle said. “As soon as they conclude their investigation, the roadways will be reopened.”
The Sheriff’s Department said that there is no suspect information available and that the investigation is ongoing.

When transgender and gender-nonconforming students held a First-Year Advocacy Board event at the LGBT Resource Center, they used the women’s restroom on the same floor as a gender neutral restroom for the evening. At that time, faculty at the center noticed hostility from older, cisgender female faculty toward the students using the restroom.
Kelby Harrison, the LGBT Resource Center director, and Michael Gorse, the LGBT Resource Center supervisor, brought this to the attention of Title IX when they realized it was a compliance issue.
“Title IX received reports that transgender and gender nonconforming students did not have an easily accessible all-gender bathroom near the LGBT resource center,” said Gretchen Means, the executive director and coordinator of Title IX in an email to the Daily Trojan. “The closest all-gender restrooms to the Student Union are in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and in Bovard. Both required a 15-minute round-trip walk, and sometimes were not open. This created a barrier for students accessing the center’s resources and programming.”
The administration first switched all of the single-stall restrooms to all-gender restrooms. However, there were still spots where restrooms were not accessible to transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. This is because in most of the buildings already constructed on campus there are only multi-stall restrooms, and switching these facilities into gender neutral facilities is much more difficult, according to Harrison.
This prompted the LGBT Resource Center to collaborate with the Title IX Office of Equity and Diversity to establish the first multi-stalled gender neutral restroom on campus in the Student Union modeled  after the United University Church’s gender-neutral restrooms.
Since transitioning to a gender-neutral restroom, the administration feels that it has made a positive impact on the transgender and gender-nonconforming students who frequent the LGBT Resource Center and the center itself.
“We’ve already had many positive reactions from gender nonconforming staff and students on its presence, that it helps them feel safer,” Harrison said. “A couple of different individuals have noted that it’s really helpful to them in their transition and that it’s been a powerful and positive experience.”
Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals usually have to go to great lengths to safely go to the restroom. Some people will refrain from using the restroom throughout the day until they get home, or avoid drinking water when they go to public spaces, to avoid possible harassment when using public restrooms, according to Mary Andres, a professor of clinical education at the Rossier School of Education
Andres focused on these issues in her career at USC. In the past, she assisted transgender and gender-nonconforming students in making arrangements to use public facilities as a counselor at the counseling center. While working with these students, she noticed how mentally damaging these restrictions can be for them.
“It is tiresome and actually unhealthy for someone to feel like they don’t want to draw attention to themselves and not be able to just go to the bathroom when they want to go to the bathroom,” Andres said.
Mya Worrell, a freshman majoring in gender studies, identifies as agender and found comfort in the expansion of gender neutral restrooms.
Warrell said that in the women’s restroom they do not feel comfortable and in the men’s restroom, they do not feel safe.
“I love seeing a gender-neutral bathroom because it means that I don’t have to not go to the bathroom or force myself to go to a bathroom that makes me feel uncomfortable,” Worrell said.
In front of the gender-neutral restroom in the Student Union, there are fliers explaining the purpose of establishing the restroom for those who are unaware of the issue. Some look at the gender-neutral restroom as a foreign threat, but the LGBT Resource Center is making efforts to inform those people through the fliers, according to Gorse.
Worrell hopes that this expansion will inform cisgender individuals of the binary prevalent in most buildings and the necessity for inclusion in public facilities.
“I hope that, first of all, seeing gender-neutral bathrooms broadens their idea of the gender binary,” Worrell said. “I also hope that they realize that they can use gender-neutral bathrooms too, because gender-neutral bathrooms are for everyone.”
Harrison believed this expansion will help critics understand the issue and take part in creating a more accepting community at USC.
“I’ve seen the difference that inclusive spaces can make for people struggling to align their gender expression and gender identity,” Harrison said. “I think it’s healthy for all people to have a more complicated understanding of gender identity and expression, and restrooms like these help to expand that understanding and conversation.”
I will work tirelessly to fight this rubbish.  We can not normalize this disorder… It’s dead wrong, and it’s not normal by any metric (biologically or statistically).  Gay, straight, curiious..  no problem.  That’s sexuality.  Changing or choosing one’s gender can not happen.  Chromosomes.  Science.  Truth.  You can dress in drag, change your name, have some surgeries …but you will still have male or female chromosomes.  This is a University for goodness sake.  Please keep your social agendas out of the science and humanities…. and most certainly out of bathrooms and locker rooms.  I believe in acceptance, tolerance and inclusion.  These are great concepts, but don’t be like the parent who refuses to teach their child the virtue of “no”.  Sometimes the answer is simply, no.  Sometimes the truth is difficult to swallow, though I don’t know why this particular truth is so hard to swallow.
All of humanity must reject and resist this total nonsense.  The chaos rightfully described by Lucasfilms’ comment here is an example of what has happened and will continue to happen if we trash science by pretending that gender is a choice.  Science has clearly taught us that gender is binary.  There are two genders:  male and female. Period.  Except for the incredibly small percentage of troubled births where nature’s assigned gender is not readily apparent, the rest of us (99.9% of normal births) are assigned a gender.  By contrast, sexuality is very fluid and appears on a broad spectrum.  There are males who express themselves sexually as females (in appearance, behaviour, etc).. and there are females who do the same.  But regardless of how you FEEL, you are male or you are female.  This social movement to abandon science in a wayward attempt at “inclusion” has led to abject chaos in all sorts of public places.  It is wholly inappropriate to marginalize or demonize the 99.9% of human beings who do not suffer any sort of gender identity disorder (through legislation or any other means).  The only acceptable approach to accommodate those with this disorder is to provide a few gender-neutral, single-use bathrooms around schools or workplaces.  These have existed since the dawn of time.  They are the type found in Starbucks or Subway.  Anyone can use them (men, women, children, parent attending a child or the elderly, and yes, people who suffer gender identity disorders).  Simply put, if you feel like you are the opposite sex, or you desire to live as the opposite sex… stop bothering the rest of us so selfishly.  Either use the bathroom (or lockeroom) that corresponds to your real gender, OR, go find a single use restroom and get over yourself.  They are not hard to find.. and even if they require walking a bit farther, who cares?!  You heard me, who cares!?  Stop being so selfish.  The rest of us don’t ‘have this problem, and unlike handicapped people, those peddling the transgender lie have abandoned science.  Well the rest of us don’t ‘want to abandon science.  Sorry.  PS:  There is nothing hateful about standing for science and demanding people be less selfish.  Now go back to class or work.

If you are a rational person with at least some confidence in the science, actually use real science. “Don’t use science to justify your bigotry.” And don’t twist Lucasfilms’ words. She says “Allowing people of all gender identities to feel safe in the bathroom is essential; let’s make it happen without victimizing women.” She does not have a problem of gender neutral bathrooms in themselves, just in how USC went about it.
Don’t you dare accuse me of bigotry because I refuse to accept your twisted social agenda.  How dare you!
That is a tired argument.  It’s like accusing people who want immigrants to come here legally of being xenophobic.  Try something original and sensible…  I have already replied to “Lucasfilms”, acknowledging that what she was saying was something different from my expanded argument.  I agree with her on the issue that only women appear to have been impacted in USC’s attempt to include so-called transgenders at the Student Union.  That is prima face wrong… But it only serves to underscore the utter nonsense and chaos that arises with foolish concepts like choosing one’s gender!  Gender is not a choice.  The science is clear, and is not subject to the whims of societal change.  I’m disgusted that I now feel the need to disclose that I am a gay male. I am attracted to other men.  Sexuality occurs on a broad spectrum and we must be tolerant and accepting of the science and biology of sexuality.  But the gay community (and unprincipled liberals in general) have taken a bridge too far by indulging people with gender identity disorder.  Like anyone with any disorder, they must be treated with love and respect.. but indulging them in a lie is NOT helping anyone.  Demonizing and marginalizing the rest of us who dont’ have that disorder is not helpful either, and is in fact, a disgrace.
I feel that Benjamin has co-opted my argument here to a certain degree, and I would just like to disavow and decry his transphobic remarks. Gender is not a binary; it is a spectrum, and the gender that people are assigned at birth is not necessarily their actual gender. I support gender-neutral bathrooms completely. I just take issue with how they have been implemented in this case.
No.. I have not co-opted anything.  I agree that in this particular case, women seem to be the only ones impacted by the new bathroom policy at Student Union.. and that is not fair.  I simply expanded on the argument to say that all of this nonsense began with the idea that one can choose their gender… and therefore, that we need to make adjustments to our bathrooms in the first place.
As a female student worker on this floor who has experienced the implementation the new “gender-neutral” bathroom firsthand, I beg to differ with the labelling of our new paradigm as a more “inclusive space.” In reality, USC is paying lip service to equality while marginalizing cisgender and transfeminine women alike. This article fails to mention that, while the floor’s only women’s restroom has been converted to be “gender-neutral,” the men’s restroom remains untouched. If the administration cared about its non-binary community, it would surely do the trivial work of installing “Gender-Neutral” signage on all bathrooms on the floor. As it is, only women are paying the price for this conversion, losing bathroom space, experiencing longer wait times for a stall or sink, and being subjected to a markedly dirtier bathroom environment. Mya Worrell hopes that this change will “broaden [cisgender people’s] idea of the gender binary.” Hopes aside, I KNOW that it has made my work experience more difficult, and the word “MEN” still clearly seared into another door on the floor where I spend much of my time doesn’t seem to challenge the patriarchal gender binary very much to me. Fight On!
PS:  It is indeed wrong that only the women’s restroom in the Student Union was impacted by this nonsense, but I have a thought as to why:  It could be because women’s restrooms have stalls, only… whereas men’s restroom also have urinals.  The administration probably faced the same dilemma that came to my mind when this lie was first peddled:  How do we handle anger and discomfort (not to mention lawsuits) by normal males who are urinating at a urinal, exposed… when a woman who feels like a man comes in to use the restroom (since it’s been labeled for everyone)??  Their answer was probably to switch only the women’s restroom since the stalls provide a measure of privacy.

Seamlessly weaving together classic and modern aesthetics and taste, the newly opened Kai Japanese Roots is a contemporary gem in the heart of historic Los Angeles. The Japanese restaurant opened on South Broadway Street on April 13 and is poised to become a champion of the renaissance growth of downtown Los Angeles.
The interior design of the restaurant featured a soothing plethora of wood evocative of Japanese minimalism. Visitors were also greeted by an indoor waterfall over a swirled black-and-yellow glass panel, a display of hanging lights and a traditional Japanese painting over the full bar in the back corner of the main dining room. The warehouse architecture of the downtown space was left partially intact, which gave the restaurant a contemporary yet traditional look. An appetizer plate, napkin, soy sauce dish and a pair of chopsticks were preset on the table, furthering the simplistic grace of the restaurant.
Water was poured into small wooden cups emblazoned with the restaurant’s logo rather than glasses, harkening ever-so-subtly back to Japanese traditions. The menu, which was disposable and came on a clipboard, was extensive but easily navigable — regular menu items, from starters to signature dishes, were listed on one side while yakitori, sushi and sashimi were listed on the other side and quantities were marked by a pen.
Options ranged from Japanese classics to house specials to innovative dishes such as the Kai nachos, comprised of a sashimi mix over wonton chips. The smaller items were diverse and made flexible to preference, as plates can be modified or spice can be added upon request. Prices were reasonable, as a main dish was no more than $20. Sushi hand rolls came in sizeable portions of eight.
Even more impressive was the beverage menu. Kai boasted not only a full bar, but also a wide selection of Japanese craft beers, sakes, sochu spirits and whiskey and malts. The owners spent months curating alcohols, cocktails and teas that would represent a robust spectrum of flavors and versatility in bringing traditions from the East to the present-day in the West.
The restaurant demonstrated a deep commitment to classic flavors in the miso soup, a perfectly salted medley of miso paste, tender tofu and fresh seaweed and leek. Another age-old dish, takoyaki, or deep-fried octopus, was given a modern twist with the adornment of wari sauce drizzles and other delicate garnishes.
The main courses exemplified the chef’s finesse and skills in plating, which co-opted the aesthetic of ornaments in Western cuisine and replaced them with Japanese ingredients. For example, the kai bowl, a sweet and spicy sashimi mix over a bed of sushi rice, was topped with slivers of avocado, a mint leaf and ribbons of radish and cucumber. Though the rice was slightly hardened, the sashimi was tender and imbued with rich flavors, and vegetables balanced the dish with freshness.
Executive Chef Miki Fujita, who apprenticed in Japan and has worked in Japanese cuisine for 27 years, attributes that shine to in the vibrancy of the dishes he carefully conceptualizes and crafts. His specialty anniversary roll — a tempura salmon and asparagus hand roll, overlaid with baked salmon, topped with tempura chips and drizzled end to end with spicy secret sauce and eel sauce — represented the foremost in cuisine and design.
The only dessert option was a green tea ice cream, which came in a matching wooden bowl topped with a dollop of whipped cream. The ice cream was a bit too cold and hard to dig into immediately, but once a bit, melted the flavors were bold and the ice cream melted smoothly.
On its website, Kai’s owners wrote, “Our guiding principle was to create a space that exemplifies the elegance of honesty and incorporates the vibrant rhythm of our surrounding environment. The goal was to craft something that would not only be authentic to Japanese cuisine and aesthetics, but equally rooted in our historically rich environment.”
As an up-and-coming restaurant in the revitalized portion of Downtown, this casual corner find is already succeeding in its mission.

“Y’all got ’til April the 7th to get y’all sh–—t together,” raps Kendrick Lamar in his first single of 2017, “The Heart Part IV.” This line, as well as the entire song, sent the world into chaos in anticipation of a new Lamar project. Since the beginning of his career, Lamar has been known for his powerful lyrics and dense, conceptual albums.
With Section.80, Lamar introduced himself as an artist in a troubled community. He explores more deeply his struggles in Compton that listeners first heard in the instant 2012 classic, good kid, m.A.A.d City. With To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, Lamar did the opposite of what rappers do today. Instead of capitalizing on his successes with a mainstream project, Lamar released the jarring, jazz-influenced record, a commentary on racism in modern America and the troubled relationship between studio and artist.
Lamar’s impressive work only increased hopes for his latest project, DAMN., which was released on April 14. Unsurprisingly, Lamar exceeded expectations with an album unlike any he has ever released before. DAMN. features a much more straightforward and familiar approach to its production. The narrative is more loosely constructed than that of his previous albums, but the record is still cohesive. It delves into several issues the Compton rapper has discussed before but in a new, creative way. Additionally, it discusses new issues faced by the rapper in the current peak of his career.
The album opens with the calm introduction, “BLOOD.” Lamar tells a story of himself on the street approaching a blind woman, attempting to help her. The blind woman then shoots the fictional Lamar. Her blindness parallels that of the ignorant people in America today. The track concludes with an excerpt from a FOX News broadcast in which Lamar’s “Alright” is criticized for glorifying violence.
The track segues into the first full track, “DNA.,” in which Lamar celebrates his heritage and the qualities of a rapper today. The song sets the tone for the rest of the record, and it establishes the complexity of the record and Lamar himself. The next track, “YAH.,” continues Lamar’s criticism of FOX News. He claims the news show manipulates Lamar’s name in order to gain ratings from viewers. Kendrick Lamar struggles with his star presence in the media because he feels it fails to accurately represent his artistry.
The next track, “ELEMENT.,”  is another response to the criticism thrown at Lamar throughout his career. Lamar raps that he will never be taken away from his craft and will continue to focus solely on his art despite the distractions. The chorus suggests that if Lamar must call out his peers and indulge in the pettiness of “beef” with other artists, he will do so in his signature style. One line in the song, “I don’t do it for the ’Gram, I do it for Compton” implies he makes music for his community, not for social media consumers.
“FEEL.” is the next track on DAMN., and it is a self-aware analysis of Lamar and the world around him. His status as a star makes him feel isolated, but in a way, he wants this isolation.
The following song, “LOYALTY.,” shows Lamar and superstar Rihanna rapping about remaining true to friendships and romantic relationships. Of course, Lamar takes this a step further and questions the audience, asking them if they are loyal to honest ideals or simply materialistic things. Rihanna closes the track by stating the difficulty of remaining humble with so much success, directly bridging this track with the next one, “PRIDE.” This track reveals Lamar at odds with himself, further emphasized by the shift in his voice from a high to low pitch throughout the track. This track delves into the overall concept of duality throughout the album — the conflict between indulging in self-promotion and doing the right thing.
The next track, “HUMBLE.,” picks up the pace of the record, directly opposing “PRIDE.” It shows Lamar satirically boasting his successes, while urging his peers to be humble about their accomplishments. Continuing on the duality theme, the next tracks, “LUST.” and “LOVE.,” complement each other.
The last few tracks of the record continue to maintain the themes of religion, pride and discontent with the world. “FEAR.” is a seven-minute epic that takes listeners through his life. At age seven, Lamar feared being beaten for misbehaving or showing any weakness. At 17, he was afraid of being yet another kid in a body bag. At 27, his self-doubt and fear of being judged overpowered him. The fear of judgment continues in “GOD.,” in which Lamar equates himself to God, only to be humbled by Him. This relates to earlier in the album, when he tells his peers to be humble.
The final track “DUCKWORTH.,” tells Lamar’s amazing origin story. Its narrative follows the young lives of Anthony, the head of Lamar’s record label Top Dawg Entertainment, and Lamar’s father, Ducky. Ducky worked at KFC and gave Anthony, known for shooting up establishments, extra food to get on his good side. Because Ducky survived the encounter, Lamar is able to fulfill his prophecy as the greatest rapper alive today.
DAMN. is yet another conceptually fascinating album from Lamar. It has a more mainstream production than that of To Pimp a Butterfly, but that only helps the album. Because the production is not complex to comprehend in and of itself, listeners can focus more on the bars in each song. The lyrics are some of Lamar’s best, and the diversity of the tracks is impressive. As he said he would, Lamar has created yet another classic.

The fear of missing out was real this weekend. Nochella, no Easter brunch with my family — and no Boston Marathon. The 121st Boston Marathon took place yesterday, and any dreams I had of making it to the premiere long-distance running event before college graduation were dashed.
For the non-runners among us, let me explain. The Boston Marathon is like the Super Bowl — except imagine that any team (professional or not) could play in the championship if they qualify. In this highly anticipated race, amateurs run right alongside some of the most elite runners in the world. Unlike other races, runners can only register for the Boston Marathon if they have met a certain qualifying time in the last year. The qualifying times for the Boston Marathon, or BQs, are fast, and they’ve only gotten faster over the years.
Out of curiosity after having just improved my half-marathon time, I looked up how fast the BQ was this year. For women ages 18 to 34, the BQ is three hours and 35 minutes. That’s a whopping hour-and-then-some faster than my first marathon. I’d have to run eight-minute miles for 26.2 miles, instead of the 11-minute miles I was averaging during the 2015 L.A. Marathon.
My immediate reaction was, “No way.” I would never be able to qualify for Boston. Sure, I could probably shave half-an-hour off my marathon time with the right kind of training, but an hour-and-a-half was unthinkable. I’d have to literally fly. It’s not possible.
But then again, running is a sport of impossibility. It’s not as flashy as a basket on the buzzer or a last-minute field goal, but it is the ultimate race against time. Humans have pushed their limits to run sub four-minute miles. In just over two weeks, Nike will attempt to break the two-hour mark for a marathon with a trio of elite runners who have been specially trained for the project. The current world record is 2:02:57.
The Boston Marathon itself is a race that defies the odds. It’s the oldest annual marathon still in existence. What started as 15 participants in 1897 developed into an event with over 27,000 competitors battling it out over “Heartbreak Hill” in 2017. The first woman to finish a major marathon did so in Boston 50 years ago, and the race organizer literally tried to chase her off the course. Katherine Switzer took part in the race again this year at the age of 70.
Everyone talks about being a part of history whenever they win some big championship, like the Super Bowl or the World Series or the Olympics. Running is one of the few sports that’s so accessible that even recreational runners can become a part of that history. They will literally run the same route as thousands of elite athletes before them. They will run in memory of the people who died in the Boston Marathon bombing four years ago. They will be what makes this race so special every single year.
I’m no record breaker, and there’s certainly nothing special about my running, but I am ambitious and competitive. One of the most satisfying things in life for me is finding out that the top of my game is much higher than anyone, including myself expected. Every single day I convince myself to go for a run, I already feel like I’m halfway to impossible.
It’s pretty unlikely that I’ll ever be able to run a 3:35:00 marathon, but I have high hopes that I’ll continue to be active for my entire life. Maybe I’ll qualify for Boston when I’m 60 and the time standard is only 4:25:00. Barring any injuries, I’ll just keep running, and I’m sure I’ll get there someday. With a goal and plan for the Boston Marathon, the FOMO seems to melt into the concrete sidewalk. Boston, see you sometime!

Terry Nguyen | Daily Trojan
As the spring season of television is upon us, the onslaught of well-written, well-shot and well-acted television seems to show no sign of stopping.
Fargo
Release Date: April 19
Viewers doubted that Fargo could live up to the Coen Brothers’
near-masterpiece 1996 film of the same name. And yet, Fargo took inspiration from the film’s idiosyncratic characters and dark murder stories to deliver an incredibly compelling and suspenseful Emmy Award-winning show. Each installment possesses its own unique narrative: The second season takes place 30 years prior to the events of the first, thinly connecting Fargo’s new and old characters.
Now, the third season will be set in 2010, but no further details yet on how its characters will connect to its earlier seasons. Fargo featured well-known actors in both its first and second seasons; with Ewan McGregor, Jim Gaffigan and Carrie Coon, its return appears promising.  From the released trailers, it appears that McGregor will star in dual lead roles as twin brothers caught up in a suspenseful murder case. Producer and writer Noah Hawley creates a tense sibling rivalry between McGregor’s two roles — twins Emmitt and Ray Stussy. In an interview with USA Today, Hawley acknowledges his goal to display the darker themes at the heart of Fargo present within the original 1996 Coen brothers’ film, as Emmitt and Ray clash over their differences in social strata, ambitions and money.
Carrie Coon will star as Gloria Burgie, the highly anticipated heroine lead, who is tied to investigating the murder case that involves the Stussy twins. The dynamic cast of characters and their backgrounds hint at the show’s darker twist. Fans should anticipate Fargo upholding its reputation as a top-notch black comedy-crime series.
Master of None
Release Date: May 12
The first season of the project Master of None, created by and starring Aziz Ansari, took the Netflix scene by storm in November 2015. It was praised for its realistic and quirky dialogue with each episode having its own unique storyline and message, and its writers, Ansari and Alan Yang, were recognized at the Emmys for “Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.”
The trailer for season two places the protagonist, Dev, back in New York after his travels abroad in Italy. Dev continues his search for love, as the trailer showcases his shenanigans with friends, family and women he takes on dates. The minute-long trailer reveals the future roles of newcomers Bobby Cannavale and John Legend in the second season, alongside the familiar faces of Dev’s parents, played by Ansari’s real mother and father.
Although it may be hard to repeat the same magic from the debut season of Master of None, Ansari and Yang will surely surprise the audience with their heartfelt stories and further character developments in Dev’s quest for love.
House of Cards
Release Date: May 30
In the midst of a contentious political climate, House of Cards attempts to represent the tumultuous events taking place in Washington onscreen in its fifth season. Season four ended with Frank and Claire Underwood fully uniting to have equal power in the White House.
The teaser trailer, creatively released on Inauguration Day, only shows an upside-down American flag with children reading the Pledge of Allegiance. However, House of Cards is notorious for delivering tense plot development complete with shocking twists. The trailer was posted on Twitter with a simple caption, “We make the terror,” which draws reference to Frank’s conflict with the Islamic Caliphate Organization, a terrorist group seeking demands from the U.S. government.
There have been no major revelations about the plot of the fifth season, but considering the final, ominous note the fourth season  ended on, many viewers speculate Frank will be driven to directly combat ICO. Season five represents a shift in showrunners, as two senior writers are stepping up to the job. Considering that the show began filming months before the U.S. presidential election, it will be interesting to see how closely the new season will mirror reality.

Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu announced Monday on Instagram that he would return for his third season with the Trojans.
Metu posted a photo of himself in front of a cheering crowd with the caption: “Year 3 coming soon…”
USC confirmed his return later Monday evening.
Metu’s decision comes after multiple teammates declared for June’s NBA Draft, potentially ending their Trojan careers. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright, redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron and junior guard Elijah Stewart have declared thus far, despite being rated lower than Metu on most draft boards. All the players declared without an agent, however, meaning they can withdraw from the draft before May 24.
Metu’s return means head coach Andy Enfield retains one of his team’s key big men. Metu averaged 14.8 points and 7.8 rebounds per game along with a team-best 55 blocks, and he was voted the Most Improved Player in the conference at the annual Pac-12 awards.

The recent turmoil rocking Arkansas over Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s attempt to execute eight men in 10 days does more than put the governor’s moral reasoning into question. Instead, the controversy surrounding the state’s hurried push to use a questionable lethal injection drug before its expiration refocuses the national conversation on capital punishment and should thrust the death penalty to the surface of urgent debate.
In the past hours and throughout the last weekend, facing nationwide criticism and action from judges, Arkansas’ rushed slate of executions has come under intense pressure and may well be blocked by external means. Midazolam, the drug in question, is a major factor responsible for a series of botched executions in which inmates suffered immensely before death. A schedule of executions as rapid as the one backed by Hutchinson will only increase the chance of making mistakes, and is characterized by The Washington Post as “a pace unmatched in the modern era.”
And yet, this fury creates another set of conflicts more ethical and philosophical but no less urgent than the legal battle being waged. If we are to condemn Arkansas’ assembly-line treatment of the death penalty as reckless, then how are we to separate this from general apathy toward the death penalty as a practice? What is different about Arkansas that makes us angry?
In the second episode of its second season, Black Mirror’s “White Bear” explores public perceptions of punishment in its depiction of a woman sentenced to ceaseless legal backlash for her crime of recording a young girl’s torture. For this she is condemned to something equally as horrifying: imprisonment in White Bear National Park, where she is forced to experience the same fear as her victim over and over again. After each day’s events, her memory is electrocuted, and she awakens each morning frightened and alone all over again. And the visitors are all around her, enjoying and encouraging her suffering.
It is a fate worse than death, but also one that serves as an analysis of punishment as a source of revenge and relishment. Capital punishment made headlines earlier this year over the sentencing of Dylann Roof, the reprehensible and unremorseful individual responsible for the horrific killings of nine parishioners in a historically black South Carolina church.
Without a doubt, Roof deserved the very worst the American justice system can offer. But to die? The debate isn’t whether he deserves it. The debate is whether state-sanctioned killing should even be an option to weigh on the public conscience.
The actions happening in Arkansas should frighten us, but where, then, do we begin to cross the line into apathy over the death penalty as a general practice? Is it hypocritical to deride Hutchinson’s rushed schedule of executions but to feel nothing toward the death sentences of people like Roof and Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev? Moreover, on a more macrocosmic spectrum, where do we draw the line between who is worth existing and who isn’t?
It sounds morally wrong to proclaim that the lives of the likes of Roof and Tsarnaev hold value in our society. But when do we get to decide whose lives are important and whose aren’t? The prison system does not exist outside of society. The prison system is built by it. We’ve all heard the cry: “Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?” Well, here is another twist: Why do we get to decide whose lives count and whose don’t?
In a sickening twist of reality, Arkansas’ attempt at mass execution mimics a satire in the likes of Black Mirror: an exaggeration of events that tests the public conscience in its extreme corruption of a national practice. Except this one isn’t fictional. This one counts.
The United States still uses the death penalty when no other comparable Western counterpart does, when such a practice continues to retain the possibility of causing insurmountable and unconstitutional human suffering and poses no significant deterrent to crime.
And if the events that may happen in Arkansas infuriate you, make you squint and ask, “Should that be right?” then what you are struggling with is not the condensed, methodical two-by-two execution of eight men in 10 days. You are reckoning with the concept of capital punishment, as a national standard and as a violation of human rights.
Spotlighted only now by recent events, the practice of state-sanctioned killing has always existed, and its shadow has always fallen — like a bruise — on the American justice system. Put in Arkansas’ new terms, it is impossible to ignore the absolute disregard for human life the death penalty poses — not in just the obvious way, but in its estimation only as a thing to be scheduled out, held at a value less than the drug promised to end it.

North Korea celebrated its most significant holiday, the Day of the Sun, last week. The holiday is a commemoration of the birth of Kim Il-Sung, the North Korean state’s first leader. The holiday is traditionally marked by the presence of both cultural festivals and military shows of force, which demonstrates something oft-forgotten about the state of North Korea: The country is not made up of only a military and a demagogic leader bent on the nuclear annihilation of every one of his opponents. Millions of civilians also live in the rogue state that has been referred to in the past as a member of the “Axis of Evil.”
Student organizations like Liberty in North Korea exist in order to remind Americans, particularly young Americans about to enter their professional and political lives, of this critical fact. The threat posed by North Korea is very real, but when rhetoric about North Korea solely revolves around the activities of the military and the danger to global security that the North Korean state represents, the innocent people under the regime’s thumb tend to be ignored, both in the media and in mainstream conversation about the country. In the interest of pursuing a peaceful solution, this must be changed, especially by students who hope to engage in international and domestic politics.
This week, the United States has ratcheted up pressure on North Korea in response to increased agitation stemming from North Korea’s missile tests and inflammatory rhetoric. President Donald Trump recently ordered Carrier Strike Group One, a substantial fleet made up of an aircraft carrier and several escort ships, to sail to the Sea of Japan. The flagship of Carrier Strike Group One, one of the largest military vessels in the world, is escorted by several smaller ships that have equipment designed to intercept ballistic missiles, and so the fleet’s presence can be seen as a precautionary measure against a potential North Korean attack.
The strike group also has planes and guided missiles at its disposal, and as its name and composition suggest, it is quite capable of spearheading an attack as well. This is likely not lost on the powers in the region, especially North Korea. The question is whether the fleet’s presence is supposed to be a calculated element of soft power aimed at influencing the behavior of North Korea, or if the fleet’s activities are indicative of a preparation for war.
It is certainly wise to be prepared in case of conflict, but the placement of a U.S. fleet in proximity to North Korea that is arguably more capable of offense than it is capable of defense is concerning. It would appear to indicate that the United States is taking on a threatening, rather than diplomatic, posture in the region. This will undoubtedly have consequences for diplomacy, but what those consequences will be with seemingly impulsive diplomatic mavericks — like Trump and Kim Jong-un — in control is impossible to say.
The primary concern moving forward is that the United States and North Korea both appear to be unwilling to deal diplomatically with one another, even nations as influential as China make pleas time and time again. Given that North Korea has sworn to resist any military threats, the United States and North Korea may be playing a game of international chicken, with a potential nuclear catastrophe endangering the lives of millions of innocent civilians thrown into the mix. We must recall that lives are lives regardless of which side of a border they are on, and that a military confrontation in the Korean Peninsula may have far-reaching and disastrous global ramifications.
In light of this, diplomacy would appear to be the best way to reduce current tensions. The international community demonstrated that it was possible to do so with another member of the “Axis of Evil,” Iran, in 2015. Students should remember these considerations when they engage in conversation about the state of affairs in East Asia, and hopefully, a peaceful solution to the problems in the Korean Peninsula will result instead of a new conflict.

A gas leak on McClintock Avenue near Downey Way prevented traffic flow and pedestrian access on Monday morning. A construction vehicle hit a gas line, according to USC Fire Safety and Emergency Planning Specialist Steve Goldfarb.
Department of Public Safety was notified at 7:18 a.m. and immediately responded to clear the area. At 8:50 a.m., the gas leak was stopped and no further issues were reported. The Los Angeles Fire Department was on the scene.
Goldfarb said the leak prompted the evacuation of Seeley G. Mudd Building and Ray R. Irani Hall as a precaution and prevented some students from attending class.
“I was a little bit worried hearing that there were gas leaks around campus,” said Oliver Kashyap, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry. “It was actually kind of nice because we had a test the next day and now it’s less to learn before the test.”
No injuries or medical issues were reported, according to DPS Assistant Chief Carlisle.
“At no time was the air quality at a point where we needed to do any other evacuations,” Goldfarb said.
The Southern California Gas Company will conduct its own investigation into the gas leak. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Chris Gilbride, a spokesman for the Southern California Gas Company, told ABC7 that a construction vehicle hit a two-inch plastic natural gas service line, causing a leak and ultimately an evacuation of the area.
Arianna Scavone contributed to this report.
