USC’s No. 14 men’s volleyball team will head to Westwood to take on the No. 6 UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion Sunday. 
The Trojans will come into the match with an overall 7-6 record and 1-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Conference, while the Bruins currently hold a 11-4 overall record and a 3-0 record in conference play.
The Trojans will be led by senior co-captains and outside hitters Ryan Moss and Jack Wyett. Moss has tallied 148 kills and hit at a .342 clip this season, while Wyett comes into the match with 151 kills on .319 hitting.
Redshirt junior opposite hitter Brandon Rattray will anchor the Bruins’ defense with 142 kills on .324 hitting this season. Rattray will be joined by junior outside hitter Austin Matautia, who has contributed 112 kills on .275 hitting to give the Trojan defense a challenge. 
Up front, redshirt junior middle blocker Tyler Resnick has totaled 29 blocks this season and is coming into the match having set season-high records after tallying five blocks in each of the Trojans’ last two matches. Senior libero Matt Douglas comes into the match with 61 digs on the season and will rely on sophomore setter Chris Hall, who set a season record of his own with 55 assists against Stanford last week.
It has been a season of ups and downs for the men’s volleyball team. After falling to No. 8 Stanford and No. 9 BYU on the road last week, the Trojans are eager to swing the momentum back in their favor.
“We have to maintain our focus [and] do a lot of video [study and] a lot of game planning against [UCLA],” senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso said. “They’re a really good team that we need to take on the road, so we have to be extra prepared and mentally focused … to know exactly what we’re doing against them.”
Historically, the Bruins have been dominant in these clashes, winning 96 of the 137 official contests between the two teams. In their last official match, however,  the Trojans came out on top to snap the Bruins’ five-match win streak. 
Despite going into the match as the underdog, the Trojans remain optimistic and excited about the challenge of facing UCLA on their home court. 
“It’s always awesome to play UCLA,” Grasso said. “It’s always a great game. We have the rivalry … and it’s something that we always look forward to.”
At 6-foot-2 — a relatively short height for an outside hitter — Grasso is known for his athleticism and creative, beach volleyball-inspired style of play. When asked what USC fans could expect from Sunday’s match, he provided some additional insight.
“[They can anticipate] a lot of energy,” Grasso said. “We expect a lot of people to be there on Sunday …and we’re just ready to rock and roll.”
With the wind of urgency and rivalry at their sails, the Trojans will be looking to walk away from UCLA with a much-needed victory and some bragging rights. The match will take place 5 p.m Sunday at Pauley Pavilion.

The USC men’s basketball team showcased strong second-half shooting to pull away with a commanding 66-49 victory over Oregon Thursday night at Galen Center.
The Trojans came out flat through the first five minutes of the game, scoring only 4 points. Oregon refused to let up on the defensive end, as USC was unable to find good open looks. The Trojans found themselves down 7-4 early into the game.
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic established himself down low by scoring the team’s first 6 points. Junior guard Jonah Mathews gave USC the lead as the Trojans recovered an offensive rebound that he was able to redeem for 2 points off of a mid-range jumper, bringing the score to 8-7.
Both sides suffered from poor shooting, as they were under 40 percent from the field through 10 minutes. USC continued to lack an inside presence and resorted to 3-point attempts that were not falling. However, strong defense on the Trojans’ end kept them in the game with the Ducks leading, 16-13.
“We were taking bad shots, and we were selfish,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Our players picked it up, and I thought [they] did a tremendous job from about the 10-minute mark on.”
USC slowed the game down and attempted to minimize offensive errors as the first half progressed. Senior forward Bennie Boatwright led this patient offensive attack with 5 straight points to tie the game at 21.
“[Boatwright] is shooting the ball as well as he has in his career,” Enfield said. “He’s just playing an all-around game.”
USC took a 24-23 lead off of an impressive team play in transition. Mathews had a steal and brought the ball down the court, where he found junior guard Derryck Thornton at the block. Thornton completed a 3-point play following a commanding lay-up as the first-half clock wound down. At the end of the half, USC held a 30-25 lead.
Senior guard Shaqquan Aaron opened scoring for the Trojans in the second half with a corner 3-pointer. Following this, the Ducks played aggressive defense, pressing USC in the back court and double-teaming Trojan shooters. However, USC still extended its lead to 37-29 with 15 minutes remaining in the game.
USC manipulated Oregon’s defensive strategy to their advantage by finding the unguarded man. Rakocevic capitalized on these opportunities with an alley-oop that excited the crowd. He went on to score from short distances several more times, lending the Trojans a much-needed inside presence. 
Boatwright further extended USC’s lead with a three. The offensive outburst from Rakocevic and Boatwright was met with equally strong efforts on the defensive end. The Trojans continued to force missed shots and held the Ducks at 29.5 percent shooting. 
USC refused to let up and continued to counter all of Oregon’s points. Rakocevic and Boatwright led the offensive charge for the Trojans with efficient games. Rakocevic finished with 17 points on 72.7 percent shooting, while Boatwright scored 20 points, including 6-of-9 from beyond the arc. At the end of the day, it was a true team win, with strong defensive efforts and 20 assists offensively.
“This was a statement game,” Rakocevic said. “We defended really well, and [Boatwright] was knocking down his shots.”
The Trojans will face Oregon State in their final home game on Saturday at 3 p.m. The Beavers currently rank higher than the Trojans in the Pac-12 standings, but a win would allow USC to keep pace with the rest of the conference.

Baseball season is my favorite season. The smell of the fresh-cut grass, the feeling of scalding-hot hard plastic seats, the sound of the pounding ball on leather, the taste of the  salty sunflower seeds. But there’s one other thing baseball season brings — the horrific sight that is USC baseball. 
Perhaps that was a bit too hyperbolic. This team is not a bad baseball squad by any means — it has a lot of talent. And this year, the Trojans did some fantastic recruiting. USC football should learn from baseball head coach Dan Hubbs in that department. 
But Trojan baseball hasn’t had a winning season since 2015, and that’s a sorry statistic. The fact that they have the 14th best recruiting class in the nation is baffling, but I guess the warm weather and historic record means a lot to these recruits.
I am really excited about two recruits in particular: starting pitcher Chandler Champlain and outfielder Preston Hartsell. 
Champlain’s first start was rough, to say the least. In his start against Nebraska Omaha (who?), the rookie didn’t last an inning. Two-thirds of an inning, nine batters faced, three hits, three walks, a drilled batter and five earned runs. A 225 ERA is not necessarily “Cy Young” material but, hey, maybe there’s room for improvement? 
In all seriousness, no pitcher should be judged by one start, especially his first start at the collegiate level. It’s just fun to poke fun at players like Champlain whose talent is undeniable. Out of high school, he was drafted to the MLB but declined to sign. He has a laundry list of awards to his name, and I have no doubt that he will mesh well with other Trojan starters like sophomore Kyle Hurt. 
USC lost some pitching talent this year in Solomon Bates, who was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 2018 MLB Draft. But if young players are directed properly, they will couple well with the Trojans’ brick wall infield.
Hartsell hasn’t started in a game, although he did pinch hit in USC’s 11-0 romp on Saturday against Nebraska Omaha. While he reached base on a fielder’s choice, he plated another runner, earning his first RBI. Coming into USC, Hartsell was rated the best outfielder in California, boasting a .396 batting average with 110 RBIs. Right now, the outfield is occupied by some veteran players like juniors Blake Sabol and Matthew Acosta at left and center, respectively, while sophomore Jamal O’Guinn holds down the right side of the lawn. 
It’s entirely possible for Hartsell to fill in for the outfielders this year. He could even take some reps at designated hitter, if he can prove his batting ability at the collegiate level and become a true asset down the line for the Trojans.
What happens when there’s a lot of talent on a losing team? Look to the person who paid for the “Lynn Swann — Fire Clay Helton” helicopter banner last semester.  While I think Hubbs is a great coach, he just isn’t cutting it for USC. The Trojans have largely been a .500 or slightly below .500 team since the Mike Gillespie era (with the exception of 2015). That period encompasses three coaches.
Hubbs is a great pitching coach. He had a fantastic 12-year tenure as Cal’s pitching coach, and he consistently produced pitching staffs with the lowest ERAs in the Pac-10. When he became the head coach at USC, that pitching knowledge and training ability didn’t translate, as USC’s team ERA barely went above average in the Pac-12 and even spent a couple years in dead last.
Hubbs is in the final year of his contract as head coach with the Trojans. While he has held the team steady, USC Athletics can’t be complacent with staying “average.” This school should be a dominant powerhouse for college baseball, and I don’t see that happening under the current management. USC could even consider hiring a new head coach while keeping Hubbs as a pitching coach. 
I feel like a broken record after repeating this throughout football season, but this team has an abundance of talent. It just needs to focus on bringing all the pieces together. If that happens under Hubbs this season, great. If Trojan baseball fans have to wait until a new skipper takes over at Dedeaux Field, fine. 
One thing is for sure: Hubbs and “potential head coach to be named” have a lot of veteran and young talent in their arsenal, and I look forward to the next few seasons.

Drake has never been known for his cultural profundity.
The Canadian-born pop star has been among A-list musical artists for almost a decade. His bells and whistles have far surpassed self-evidence, yet the obvious nature of his tricks seem to remain overlooked by the masses. No matter the quality of the release, millions of people stream and purchase new Drake songs every day.
The rapper’s dichotomy is more apparent today than ever before, as he consistently flexes his technical prowess while superficially telling stories of his life that never fully transcend his scope of narcissism — but they never really needed to.
Drake “writes” hits — there’s no denying that. His latest project, 2018’s “Scorpion,” spawned three No. 1 singles and a plethora of other charting tunes. His craft stands as a flawless, robotoic process of pumping out so much material that some of it is bound to catch on. The latest move in the ever-expanding career of the prolific rapper reflects this exercise.
The “So Far Gone” re-release signals the annoying but incredible business savvy Drake possesses. In more ways than one, he is the Taylor Swift of hip-hop. The artist calculates his every move, keenly aware that dropping one of his most beloved mixtapes again would prevent many of his fatigued fans from jumping ship for Kendrick Lamar or J. Cole. The tape serves as a reminder of who Drake really is, perhaps even surprising his latecomer fans who only started following him after the smash crossover hit “One Dance” in early 2016. 
With that said, the set’s re-release simultaneously suggests the rapper hasn’t really changed that much at all. His knack for genre experimentation exists as much on “So Far Gone” as it does on “More Life” or “Scorpion.” His ability to integrate “Summer Games” and “Emotionless” on the same record in “Scorpion” is a direct result of his success with “Little Bit” and “Ignant Shit” on “So Far Gone”.
In terms of genre, “So Far Gone” pulls from every one, including R&B, hip-hop, pop and alternative. He duets with Lykke Li, pops off with Lil Wayne and expresses vulnerability on “Say What’s Real,” a classic beat from Kanye West’s criminally underappreciated “808s and Heartbreak.”
In fact, the tape shows Drizzy rapping over some of the hip-hop’s most classic beats and now fulfilled expectations to be just as, if not more, successful than the likes of Jay-Z and Kanye West. The production evokes emotion that Drake is able to use as a launchpad to dive headfirst into the sensitive persona that has made him a mainstay.
Drake’s recounting of personal experiences is what brought him to stardom, but there is always an element of cheesiness to his music. This is as evident today as it was on “Ignant Shit,” where Drake raps, “Still spittin that shit that they shot Pac over / The shit my other look shocked over,” a lyric that often incites laughter. To compare himself to 2Pac is to suggest Drake is a political figure when, in reality, Drake is the pop star that kids make memes about on Twitter and Instagram and whose music fans blare in cars.
Still, there’s really nothing wrong with that. Drake is beloved for this quality. To say you don’t bop to the opening line of “Uptown” or head-bang to the buttery “Little Bit” is to overlook the strength of Drake’s music. His music is made for the masses, even if it might be rooted in superficiality.
There is a Drake song for everything and everyone and “So Far Gone” acts as a reminder of that. While its re-release does nothing more than celebrate some of the early treasures of his discography, there’s certainly a lot worth bopping to.

The 27th Art of Motion Picture Design Exhibition at the Fashion Institute for Design and Merchandising Museum is displaying costumes from the past year’s Academy Award-nominated films and other fan-favorites from Feb. 5 to April 12.
This year’s exhibition features designs from all five films nominated for Best Costume Design: “Black Panther,” “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” “Mary Queen of Scots,” “The Favourite” and “Mary Poppins Returns.” Other featured films include “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “A Star Is Born,” “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Ocean’s 8,” among many others.
With the Academy Awards on Sunday, much of the media’s focus is the acting and directing categories. This exhibition pays homage to equally important, if not underappreciated, artists in the film industry — the costume designers. Along with the hair and makeup department, these individuals help transform actors into ’70s rock legends, Western cowboys and 18th century royalty.
The museum is split into four galleries. Each has videos and large posters with design information to accompany the array of costumes.
The first gallery displays costumes from action-based movies: Costumes from “Black Panther” are on a stand in the middle, displaying the queen of Wakanda’s elaborate white-and-gold gown in the spotlight. To the left are costumes from “Avengers: Infinity War,” and to the right, outfits used in “Aquaman,” “A Quiet Place” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story” are displayed.
The second gallery features 14 costume illustrations, revealing early design ideas for films such as “A Simple Favor” and “First Man.” The gallery also highlights the chic designer clothes from “Crazy Rich Asians” and the glamorous Met Gala gowns worn in “Ocean’s 8.” In another corner of the room are two costumes from “A Simple Favor.” From Blake Lively’s white pinstripe jumpsuit and Anna Kendrick’s pom-pom sweater, the ability of costume designers to convey differences in characters is incredibly prevalent.
In the third gallery stands the iconic Freddie Mercury “crown and robe” look, front and center. Just like Mercury himself, the intricately designed deep red, gold-encrusted costume commands attention. To the direct left are designs from “Mary Poppins Returns,” including two from the film’s 2-D animation sequence. By painting details like bows and ruffles onto the fabric rather than using actual accessories, the outfits appear to be 2-D.
In the fourth and final gallery are 16th and 18th century gowns and outfits featured in the films “Mary Queen of Scots” and “The Favourite.” As with the rest of the exhibition, one can get incredibly close to the designs and observe each crystal, thread and sequin carefully sewn into the fabrics. The intricacies of each piece don’t always capture attention onscreen, so the opportunity to view them up close is illuminating.
Less than a 10-minute ride from campus and free to the public, the exhibition is a worthy experience for fashion lovers and film buffs alike.

Congresswoman and Black Congressional Caucus Chair Karen Bass will deliver this year’s commencement address, USC announced Thursday. 
The 136th annual commencement ceremonies will take place on May 10. 
Bass follows Pulitzer Prize-winning author Siddhartha Mukherjee, who spoke last year, and actor and alumnus Will Ferrell, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Disney President and CEO Bob Iger, who served as speakers in previous years.
Bass has served as a member of Congress since 2011.
“Bass was sworn in to chair the Congressional Black Caucus in January and joined the U.S. Congress in 2011,” the news release read. “A lifelong Angeleno and daughter of a U.S. postal worker, Bass served as an emergency room Physician Assistant at LAC+USC Medical Center early in her career.”
In addition to having worked at the Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center, Bass holds a graduate degree in social work from the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. 
“As a prominent member of the Trojan Family, Congressmember Bass sets an outstanding example of leadership and public service for our graduating class,” Interim President Wanda Austin wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Bass founded the Community Coalition in South Los Angeles, an organization dedicated to influencing public policy to aid communities struggling with crime, addiction and poverty. 
Bass, the recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, was elected to represent L.A. in the State Assembly in 2005 and became the first ever African American woman elected to the state legislative body. She currently serves as the representative for California’s 37th district, which includes USC’s main campus. In Congress, Bass has served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and Judiciary Committee.
“Bass has been recognized as a coalition builder in times of economic distress and divisiveness,” Austin wrote. “She is a leader for our time and a standard bearer of USC’s ideals.”
An estimated 60,000 guests are expected to attend, according to  USC News release. Approximately 15,000 degrees will be conferred during the ceremonies, which will take place at both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.

Sports journalists Jemele Hill and LZ Granderson discussed the intersection of sports and politics and gave professional advice to students at Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday. Miki Turner, an assistant professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, moderated the discussion.
During the discussion, Turner asked the journalists if in the wake of criticism of the sports industry from athletes like former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James, that sports still unified people in America. Hill said that since President Donald Trump spoke out against political activism among black athletes, the sports industry has become more polarizing for everyone involved. 
“But even before somebody like Donald Trump came along, there was always this very uncomfortable dynamic of black talent, entertaining white fans,” Hill said. “There were some … hard conversations that needed to be had about why we were good enough to entertain, but not good enough to own or to be in a decision making capacity.”
Hill said that while sports have excluded minority groups in the past, events like the Olympics and the Super Bowl help bring people of all races together.
“These are all shared experiences, and so sports while at times has not been the leader in society, it could be,” Hill said. “At other times, it has shown us what we’re capable of.”
Hill also discussed a column she wrote in The Atlantic about Kaepernick’s recent settlement with the NFL, in which he alleges the NFL “blacklisted” him. The settlement will potentially allow him to play again. She said the controversial settlement was a victory for Kaepernick and NFL players as a whole.
“The NFL has a very long and dedicated history toward pummeling people in court,” Hill said. “This is as close to a guilty verdict as your going to get with the NFL.”
Granderson also talked about “Empire” actor Jussie Smolett, who was recently charged with falsely claiming to be the victim of a hate crime. He said it was unfortunate that Smolett’s case received significantly more attention from Chicago officials than other black and LGBTQ people who have been true victims of hate crimes. 
“I know queer people of color who have suffered violence, and they can’t get one cop … to look at what actually happened to them,” Granderson said. 
Granderson also discussed the importance of social media to inform audiences and spread information about hate crimes, such as police brutality. 
“I think there is a lot of good that can come from [social media],” Granderson said. “It’s up to the individual person who’s both writing and reading to decide if they want to use this power for good or evil.” 
While she didn’t grow up with social media, Hill said she understands its importance in spreading information in the digital age. 
“I think it’s important to understand its value, … but you can’t take it seriously in the sense that people you don’t know, you can’t allow their opinions of you, of your words to really settle in your spirit,” Hill said.
Kelly Jones, a visitor at USC, said that she enjoyed hearing about the speakers’ varied experiences in sports journalism.
“[The event] brought together a couple of people who really have a lot of experience in sports journalism and were comfortable to tell very honest stories and just had a lot of integrity in what they said,” Jones said.
