USC’s defense got a stop to push Arizona off the field early in the second quarter. The Trojans were up by one touchdown, but the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum sat eerily quiet during the homecoming game. 
If you looked away for a second, you might have thought someone made a home run play. But, it was just freshman quarterback Jaxson Dart running out with the offense, making his long-awaited debut at the Coliseum as the crowd chanted “Let’s Go, Dart.” 
The Trojans scored on their first two possessions with Dart under center, and the crowd leapt out of their seats as USC went on its way to a 41-34 victory Saturday night over Arizona. But, midway through the second quarter, it was the nightmare before Halloween for Trojan fans.
After junior wide receiver Drake London’s second touchdown of the game, he stayed on the ground holding his right leg. The entire USC sideline kneeled with its helmets off. London’s ankle was immediately put into an air cast as he exited into the tunnel on a cart. 
London was second in the country with 11.3 receptions and 143.3 receiving yards per game entering Saturday. London’s status is now up in the air. 
“Until everything is done, [London] will be out right now,” said Head Coach Donte Williams in a post-game press conference Saturday. “[A season-ending injury] is a fear.”
Arizona’s freshman quarterback Will Plummer made some Trojan fans tense when he ran for a touchdown to cut the USC lead down to 10 with 12:50 left in the game. An Arizona field goal made it a one-possession game with 6:04 remaining. 
But, senior running back Keaontay Ingram galloped down the field to set up a Trojan field goal to close out the win. 
Ingram ended with a career-high 204 yards rushing plus one touchdown on 27 carries — his second game in a row with over 100 yards and third of the season. His career day gave him the most rushing yards by a USC running back since Aca’Cedric Ware had 205 in 2018.
“When my number’s called on I just gotta go execute,” Ingram said. “One thing that we believe in, Coach  [Williams preaches] all the time, [is] be physical and bring that physicality, and I feel like we did that at the line of scrimmage today.”
USC’s offense found comfort early on and maintained it throughout the game. The Trojans eclipsed 500 total yards against a Wildcats team fourth in total defense in the Pac-12 allowing 362.4 yards per game.
The first drive of the game ended with a touchdown run by Ingram, who continued as the lead back in a run-heavy game plan for USC. Redshirt sophomore running back Darwin Barlow and redshirt senior running back Vavae Malepeai combined for 14 carries. 
The Trojans mixed it up in the passing game with Dart and junior quarterback Kedon Slovis alternating throughout the game. They combined for 313 passing yards for the game. Coming into Saturday, Arizona only allowed 176.4 passing yards per game, second-best in the Pac-12. 
Slovis and Dart served as a one-two punch in a two-quarterback system last used during USC’s Rose Bowl-winning 1996 season. Then USC Head Coach John Robinson switched between Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz after each quarter.
Williams said during the post game press conference Saturday the decision to split between the two quarterbacks will depend on the game.
“We’ll continue to do what we need to do to win the football game,” he said. “So, that’s what we felt we needed to do to beat Arizona. We’ll look at the game plan to see if that’s what we need to do to beat Arizona State.” 
The decision to switch between the two was made on Tuesday, Williams said. Slovis said he found out about the move Friday.
“I wanted to know why, obviously,” he said. “Not to take away from [Dart], he’s a great player. But, I just wanted to know if there was something I was doing to make this happen or what the reasoning was behind it.” 
USC’s defense struggled to contain an Arizona offense that hadn’t eclipsed 20 points since November 2020. The Trojans also became the only team to allow the Wildcats to score at least 28 points in the last two seasons.
Arizona stayed alive with season highs in total yards. They blew past their season average of 339.4 per game with 466 yards against USC — the third time this season the Trojans have allowed over 400 total yards. All instances have happened at the Coliseum. 
Plummer was sacked five times and the USC defense allowed eight 3rd-down conversions, the same number as last week against Notre Dame.
The Trojans face Arizona State on the road next Saturday.

No. 10 women’s soccer, the current Pac-12 leader, will face off against No. 9 Stanford in a contested bout between title contenders. The Trojans beat UC Berkeley Thursday after two draws against the Washington schools last weekend. 
Entering the match, the Golden Bears were amid a prolific run as they managed three consecutive victories and clean sheets over Utah, Arizona and Arizona State. 
USC ended its historical 11-game win streak with draws against the two teams from Washington but remained unbeaten in Pac-12 play. 
“It was a great performance,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in a postgame interview with the Daily Trojan. “Clearly, we got some energy being back home … I thought we executed the game plan really well.” 
USC persevered through previous player absences, with redshirt senior forward Jada Talley missing the previous game against Washington State and senior forward Penelope Hocking absent in the games against Washington and Berkeley. 
Junior forward Hannah White and freshman forward Simone Jackson once again were included in the starting eleven. The former contributed a goal and an assist to in-form junior midfielder Croix Bethune en route to a 2-0 victory over Cal Thursday. 
“I think they showed great spirit,” McAlpine said. “It’s a testament to what we have been able to do sort of all season — getting a lot of people experience, so, in these moments, they are ready to take the opportunity. [Bethune] and [White] have been consistent throughout. I also thought Savannah DeMelo’s performance defensively was fantastic.” 
Seasoned forward Hocking missed a second consecutive game against Berkeley after experiencing a knock against Washington State last week. USC’s all-time leading goalscorer currently has 5 goals and 2 assists in seven Pac-12 matches. 
“It’s all day-by-day,” McAlpine said. “ [Hocking] is recovering and doing well, but no set timeline.” 
The Trojans’ match against the Cardinal as the Pac-12 leader is part of a three-horse race for the conference title that includes Stanford and UCLA. Following the victory over Berkeley and Stanford’s loss against UCLA Thursday evening, USC remains on top of Pac-12 standings with a 2-point advantage over second place UCLA. 
However, USC’s confrontation with Stanford on Sunday will intensify the race for the conference title. 
“As we hit this final stretch, you’re talking about being in first place and holding on to that,” McAlpine said. “We beat a good Cal team [Thursday] … Stanford is the next one in front of us, and we will create good tactics for it.” 
Before conceding a last-minute goal against UCLA Thursday evening, Stanford held two consecutive victories with a total of 6 goals and two clean sheets. Despite falling down to third-place and 19 points in the Pac-12 standings, Stanford still has a mathematical chance to clinch the Pac-12 title. 
“We think we’re pretty in-form as well,” McAlpine said. “[Stanford has] to prepare for us the same way, so we’re looking forward to it.”  
USC will play its second-to last Pac-12 match against Stanford Sunday in a vital match for the race for the conference title. Kickoff is at 12 p.m.
