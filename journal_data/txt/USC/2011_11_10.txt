The USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams are headed out to the desert this weekend to face their first major tests in the pool.
The swim teams, both of which finished in the top-10 last in the country last year, will face Arizona on Friday and Arizona State on Saturday. While not overlooking Arizona State, Arizona figures to be one of the tougher tests the Trojans will face all season.
“The Wildcats are one of the top five teams in the country year in and year out,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “[They] always bring their ‘A’ game against us and under first year head coach Eric Hansen we expect maybe an ‘A+’ game.”
Both teams have had about 20 days since their last competitive action. Still, Salo expects a solid performance from his squads, despite the fact that there has been a layoff.
“It is time for the Trojans to send the message that we are building off our successes of last year,” Salo said. “Our goal for this weekend of competition is to post some of the top times thus far in the early season.”
Salo said the team will look to sophomore Vladimir Morozov and sophomore Dimitri Colupaev on the men’s side to lead the team to what is hopefully a successful first Pac-12 meet. Morozov was the Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year last season and is one of the top swimmers in the country. He was an All-American in four events last season and looks primed to be even better this season. Colupaev, who is a sophomore as well, was an All-American in three events.
On the women’s side, senior Katinka Hosszu and junior Haley Anderson will be crucial to the women’s chances, according to Salo. Hosszu was the NCAA swimmer of the year and the winner of the Honda Award last season and was an All-American in four events, including the 200-yard fly and the 500-yard freestyle. Anderson was an All-American in 1650-yard freestyle and as part of the 800-yard freestyle relay team last season.
Salo pointed out that because the Olympics occur in 2012, some of his swimmers will be focused on not only performing well in the collegiate ranks, but in qualifying for the Olympics as well. This week’s contests against Arizona, who finished fifth the country last season, and the Sun Devils cannot be taken lightly, according to Salo. The meets in Arizona are crucial to the Trojans getting off to a great start for what could be a special year.
“This is an exciting year for us,” Salo said. “As we are coming off one of our most successful [seasons in] the past 10 years.”
The meet against Arizona begins Friday at 2 p.m. in Tucson, Ariz., while the contest against the Sun Devils will begin Saturday at 11 a.m. in Tempe, Ariz.

After a freshman campaign in which driver Nikola Vavic led USC with 49 goals, it was natural to heap lofty expectations on the sophomore. Thus far, the sophomore has tallied 25 goals with only three regular season games remaining and eight games in total if USC should advance to the NCAA finals as it did a year ago.
Though Vavic has not found the back of the net as frequently as he did last season, he is beginning to heat up on the score sheet, too, burying eight goals in his last two games.
Lethal · Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic has notched 25 goals this year and is one of many offensive weapons for USC’s balanced scoring atttack. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
With Vavic’s recent scoring surge bolstering the offense, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (17-2, 6-0) will look to extend its eight-game winning streak in two matches this weekend. On Friday at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium, the Trojans will host No. 13 Concordia (29-4) at 5 p.m. for its final regular season home game, hoping to close out an undefeated season at home. Saturday, USC will travel up north to face No. 7 Pacific (11-10, 1-4) in an MPSF matchup.
“With Nikola, his goal is usually to pass first and that’s a good thing, but if you always look to pass first, you’re going to miss some good opportunities,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “It was good to see in these two games that he was taking shots, and we need him, as the season goes on, to score goals and be a top threat for us.”
Collegiate water polo is notoriously top-heavy, with only a few upsets of top-five programs each season. Despite this reality, Jovan Vavic insists Concordia — a team USC beat 15-7 last season in its first ever match — is underrated and could challenge USC provided the Trojans are not focused.
“Concordia has three good outside shooters and one strong two-meter man,” Jovan Vavic said. “Concordia beat Santa Barbara at Santa Barbara, and they only lost to Pacific by one goal. So Concordia is one of those teams that can surprise you.”
The marquee match-up of the weekend, however, remains the game against Pacific. The Tigers are 1-4 in MPSF play following a gut-wrenching 13-12 overtime loss to powerhouse No. 1 UCLA and a 9-8 upset win over No. 5 Santa Barbara.
“[Pacific and Concordia] are both very similar,” Nikola Vavic said. “Both teams have quite a few European players who are good shooters. Pacific has big strong two-meter men.”
Sophomore attacker Balazs Erdelyi and senior attacker Tom Koning pace Pacific with 45 and 42 goals, respectively. In the cage, Pacific goalie Alex Malkis posts an average of 9.9 saves per game.
Ultimately, USC hopes it continues to peak at the right time, especially in advance of the upcoming titanic match with UCLA.
“It seems to me that every game we’re doing something better than in the game before,” Jovan Vavic said. “Overall, we are clicking at the right time.”

After two years of narrowly missing the NCAA tournament, the Women of Troy have one goal in their third year under USC coach Michael Cooper.
Experience · Senior guard Ashley Corral, an All-Pac-10 First team selection last year, is one of five core returners for the Women of Troy. - DailyTrojan file photo
“We need to get to the tournament,” senior guard Ashley Corral said. “We need to show who we are, that we’re as good as those [other] top 25 teams.”
The Women of Troy’s quest for an NCAA tournament bid begins tonight against Fresno State at 5 p.m.
The high expectations, however, aren’t just coming from the team. USC was voted No. 23 in the preseason Associated Press poll, the first time it has been ranked since 2006.
“If you can stay inside the [top] 25, it’s almost an automatic berth into the tournament,” Cooper said. “That’s where we want to eventually end up, so a ranking is definitely good, but now we have to live up to that and win consistently.”
Despite missing out on the NCAA tournament last year, the Women of Troy received an invitation to the 64-team Women’s National Invitational Tournament, where they won five games in a row to reach the championship game before falling to Toledo.
“I had never played in the postseason, and I know none of my teammates had either,” Corral said. “It helped our bodies get used to playing that long of a season.”
USC is ranked second in the preseason Pac-12 media poll, behind Stanford, who reached the Final Four last season and is ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press poll.
The Women of Troy haven’t beat the Cardinal since the 2007-2008 season, but they have high hopes to dethrone the defending conference champions.
“I think we’re going to give a challenge to everyone we play,” Cooper said. “The Pac-12 is not a cakewalk this year. Stanford is the team to knock off the top, and we’re going to give them all that they can handle.”
By the time USC squares off against Stanford, they will have plenty of experience against top-notch competition.
Before they even start conference play, the Women of Troy will have faced six teams that made the NCAA tournament last year.
Those games include a road trip to defending national champion Texas A&M on Dec. 18, and a trip to the Bahamas for a tournament where they will play national runner-up Notre Dame, and either Duke or Gardner-Webb, both of which participated in the tournament last year.
“We have to go win those big games on the road for us to get credit,” Corral said. “It’s a good showing for the committee, and we know what we have to do.”
Though USC faces some tough competition in the early going, it does bring back its core group of players from a year ago. Corral is one of four returning All-Pac-10 honorees for USC. Senior guard Briana Gilbreath earned an Associated Press All-American honorable mention while leading USC in scoring, rebounds, steals and blocks last season.
Fifth-year senior Jacki Gemelos returns at the point, where she earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention and was USC’s third-leading scorer in her first full season after recovering from numerous knee surgeries that plagued her first three years in Los Angeles.
Sophomore forward Cassie Harberts was the only player to start every game last season and was selected to the Pac-10 freshman team after being one of four USC players to average double-digit scoring.
“Look for Cassie to be a little bit more solid in [the post],” Cooper said. “She did a good job last year, but she really worked on the weights [in the offseason] so she should have a little more strength.”
Freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama is the only new face in the starting lineup, taking the spot of graduate Kari LaPlante. The freshman, listed at 6-foot-1, isn’t as tall as LaPlante, but has been praised by her coaches for her tenacity and athleticism.
“[Vaioletama] is an athletic big that we haven’t seen around here in a long time,” Cooper said. “Fans are going to be very impressed and surprised with the way she’ll play, especially as a freshman.”
Freshmen forward Deanna Calhoun and guards Ariya Crook and Kiki Alofaituli make up the rest of USC’s No. 8 ranked recruiting class.
Junior forward Christina Marinacci could move into the starting lineup at some point, after finishing second on the team in rebounding and fifth in scoring last year.
“This group here is special,” Cooper said. “All of our players definitely took a step forward this year. They finally get what we want to do, what we want to accomplish.”
That attitude is even rubbing off on the newcomers.
“We just need to suck it up, and work hard on and off the court to get to the [tournament],” Vaioletama said. “That’s what our main goal is. My expectations are very high for this team.”

The No. 4 USC women’s volleyball team will head north to play Oregon State and No. 20 Oregon this weekend for USC’s last road trip of the regular season, as the race for the Pac-12 title comes to a close.
The champion of the Pac-12’s inaugural season likely won’t be decided until USC (20-4, 15-2) plays at No. 1 UCLA (22-3, 15-2) in the season finale on Nov. 25.
Unselfish · Senior setter Kendall Bateman notched her 4,000th career assist last weekend, becoming the third player in USC history to do so. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
But for that match to be deemed winner-take-all, the Bruins and the Women of Troy will have to defeat the Oregon squads on the road this weekend and beat Arizona and Arizona State at home the following weekend.
USC coach Mick Haley admits “there is a possibility” that the finale against UCLA could act as a Pac-12 championship game, but he says there are still important matches to be played before that.
“I don’t like to speculate on those types of things,” Haley said. “We can’t look past the Oregon teams. We have to take it one step at a time.”
USC’s next step comes on Friday against Oregon State (14-12, 6-10), a team the Women of Troy swept earlier this season.
Haley says the rematch will be much tougher this time around in Corvallis, Ore., where the Beavers hold a 7-4 record.
“We’re going to get their best,” Haley said. “If they lose this weekend, they probably won’t make the NCAA tournament. Their backs are against the wall.”
Outside hitter Camille Saxton leads the Beavers with 3.53 kills per set, and she is second in the Pac-12 with 34 service aces, behind only USC senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who has 36.
On Saturday night, the Women of Troy will travel to Eugene, Ore., for a showdown with the Ducks (17-7, 10-8), who have won five of their last six matches.
The Ducks boast outside hitter Alaina Bergsma, who ranks third in the conference with 4.60 kills per set, and setter Lauren Plum, who is second in the conference with 11.88 assists per set.
Though blocking isn’t usually considered to be one of USC’s strong suits, the Women of Troy do have a statistical advantage in the category over the Ducks, who are ranked last in the Pac-12 with 1.75 blocks per set.
Perhaps because of that, Haley says the play of his middle blockers — senior Lauren Williams, sophomore Alexis Olgard and freshman Hannah Schraer — will be critical this weekend.
If USC performs like it has over the past couple weekends, its chances look good.
Williams, who leads the Pac-12 in hitting percentage (.406), posted 20 kills and six blocks in last weekend’s home victories over No. 11 Washington and Washington State.
“[Williams] is a dynamic offensive player,” Haley said. “I just want her to improve her blocking.”
Olgard broke out two weekends ago in her first start of the season against No. 5 California with eight kills after missing most of the season recovering from knee surgery. She’s since split time with Schraer, who has repeatedly received praise from Haley for stepping in as a freshman.
Rotating in different middles can make it tough for setters to get a rhythm going, but senior setter Kendall Bateman says having several capable middles is more beneficial than negative.
“There’s a good feeling for all the middles,” Bateman said. “[Williams] is a fifth-year senior with lots of experience, I got to play with [Olgard] for all of last season, and I was playing with [Schraer] for all this year before [Olgard] came back.”
That depth might give the Women of Troy a big advantage this weekend, but they aren’t underestimating anyone.
“We have a great deal of respect for all the teams in our conference,” Haley said. “It’s especially hard to play on the road in the Pac-12.”
USC starts the weekend’s matches Friday against Oregon State at 7 p.m., before traveling to Oregon on Saturday for an 8:30 p.m. match.

Fans attending USC’s season opener Friday night against Cal State Northridge might need to bring a roster to the Galen Center to identify all of the new players.
Carrying the load · Sophomore guard Maurice Jones will be relied on heavily this season to offset the loss of injured senior guard Jio Fontan. - Daily Trojan file photo
 
Leading scorer and rebounder Nikola Vucevic departed a year early for the NBA.
Starting forwards Marcus Simmons and Alex Stepheson, in addition to guard Donte Smith, graduated.
Senior point guard Jio Fontan suffered a ligament tear in his left knee in August during USC’s Brazilian exhibition tour that could sideline him the entire season. Sophomore forwards Evan Smith and Curtis Washington will miss games because of shoulder injuries.
The only returning players that scored a point for the Trojans last season are sophomore guard Maurice Jones and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson.
“We are a young group, but we have talent,” Jones said.
As a result of the significant roster turnover, younger players will have more of an opportunity to play immediately.
The Trojans bring in two freshman guards, 6-foot-2 Alexis Moore from Long Beach Poly and 6-foot-5 Byron Wesley from Etiwanda.
“It is a lot of pressure with [Fontan] going down,” Moore said. “It is definitely not something we wanted, but now I will have to learn at an accelerated rate and play like a senior, even though I am only a freshman.”
Moore and Wesley will have to overcome jitters playing in their first official collegiate game.
“No matter what I say to these guys, they are going to be nervous,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “They are freshman and have not played on this level before. It is a learning process.”
USC will also count on several transfers, including junior guard Greg Allen (Navarro College), junior center James Blasczyk (Lee College), redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon (Antelope Valley College) and junior forward Aaron Fuller (Iowa).
The Trojans held two scrimmages, against Air Force and Long Beach State the last couple weeks, which were both closed to the media and fans, making tonight’s game the first opportunity for the general public to see the new players.
“I want us to be solid offensively,” O’Neill said. “Hopefully we run our stuff offensively and not turn over the ball.”
The Matadors lost their two leading scorers and four highest rebounders from last season, but bring back two starters. Senior guard Vinnie McGhee, who averaged 6.7 points per game last year, is Cal State Northridge’s leading returning scorer.
The game is the season opener for the Matadors as well. Cal State Northridge is ineligible for postseason competition this season because of a low Academic Progress Rate score.
The last time USC faced Cal State Northridge, in 2005, the Matadors came out on top, 81-76 in overtime.
Tip-off against the Matadors is scheduled for 8 p.m., following the women’s basketball game against Fresno State at 5 p.m.
“We are really looking forward to finally playing real games,” Jackson said. “We have been working out hard all summer doing lifting, conditioning and shooting, so we are excited and ready to play.”

Despite a big matchup with Washington on the horizon, No. 18 USC looked calm and collected in its final practice Thursday before Saturday’s highly anticipated Pac-12 matchup. Despite the calm, freshman tailback Amir Carlisle remains excited to be playing in front of an enthusiastic crowd.
“I was told that this game was also sold out,” Carlisle said. “So, you know, it’s going to be a great atmosphere. We have great fans.”
Carlisle, who hails from Santa Clara, Calif., had 10 carries for 90 yards against Colorado last week and has relished the chance to perform with injuries to the other tailbacks.
“Going into the game, I didn’t know if I was going to play or not,” Carlisle said. “It happened that [junior tailback] Curtis [McNeal] came out and the opportunity presented itself and I got out there and made the most of it. The line did a great job, and I got out there and played. And it felt great.”
The Huskies, coming off of a 34-17 loss to No. 6 Oregon, have gotten the best of the Trojans in the last two seasons, including a win at the Coliseum last season. They feature star tailback Chris Polk and quarterback Keith Price, and they are led by tackle Alameda Ta’amu on defense. Carlisle is aware that the Huskies present a difficult challenge, despite the fact they have lost three games.
“They’re a great team,” Carlisle said. “Great coach, and a good offense. And they have a really good defense and they’re great on special teams. We gotta bring our “A“ game. We can’t take this team lightly.”
The Trojans racked up 561 yards of offense against Colorado, and only gave up 17 points. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley set the USC single-game record for touchdown passes with six while throwing for 318 yards. Freshman Marqise Lee had 124 yards receiving while sophomore Robert Woods had 130 yards of his own.
Washington, however, figures to be a greater test, as they average close to 34 points a game. The Trojans are confident that if they play their game, they will have a good chance of improving their record to 8-2.
“We just gotta go out there and play a great game,” Carlisle said. “Play as a unit, just focus on our game plan and, you know, just gotta get the job done.”

Defense — it’s been a trademark of USC football.
Sure, we always hear about Matt Leinart, Reggie Bush and Mike Williams, the high-powered offenses during those years when former USC coach Pete Carroll was around. Those Trojans’ teams boasted some of the most electrifying players in the nation.
Though the Trojans sported one of the most high-powered offenses in the nation, their defense was just as good, if not better. But it seems as if defense is always undervalued and not as recognized, no matter how talented and no matter how good they might be.
As fans, we like the eye-popping jukes, the one-two dance steps around a defender, the amazing leaping ability to nab a pass in the end zone. Not too many people care for the defense sans the big hit, which, in USC’s case, would likely result in a suspension.
Under Carroll, a great defense was almost a given. Former linebackers coach Ken Norton Jr. had a knack for bringing in talented four- and five-star recruits. USC had a reputation for developing linebackers. Forget about Tailback U. What about Linebacker U? And yes, let’s forget about Penn State for one moment here.
Lofa Tatupu, Keith Rivers, Rey Maualuga, Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews III and Kaluka Maiava come to mind. And in 2005, three highly touted freshmen linebackers — Maualuga, Cushing, Maiava — and one walk-on — Matthews — ultimately became the backbone of the USC defense.
As freshmen and sophomores, significant playing time paved their way to success. As seniors, they spearheaded arguably one of the best defenses in USC history and those four were heralded as arguably the best linebacking corps in the history of college football.
And it was for good reason.
The Trojans’ defense that year ranked first in the nation in points allowed (7.8) and total yards allowed per contest (206.1).  Their rush defense ranked fifth in the nation, allowing just under 84 rushing yards per game.
This year a very similar situation might be playing out right before us. Against Colorado, USC coach Lane Kiffin elected to start freshmen linebackers Lamar Dawson and Tre Madden and redshirt freshman Hayes Pullard. Redshirt freshman Dion Bailey, who regularly starts, was out because of an injury. Going forward, Kiffin stated that Dawson will remain the starter. With that in mind, we could see Dawson, Pullard and Bailey, all freshmen, all starting for the remaining three games this year.
Despite their youth, Bailey and Pullard rank No. 1 and No. 2 on the team in tackles, respectively. Their play, and the play of the defense in general in the last four games, has been a key reason for USC’s improvement on defense. The Trojans held California to just nine points and Bailey picked off quarterback Zach Maynard twice. The Notre Dame running game was limited to just 41 rushing yards. Even Stanford’s vaunted rushing attack was held to just 3.9 yards per carry after averaging more than five yards per carry coming into the contest.
This season, the defense ranks 19th in the nation in rush defense, allowing more than 106 yards per contest. It has allowed just 13 rushing touchdowns this year, and only five in the last four games.
Many of us might criticize the defense for its shortcomings or even point the finger at assistant coach Monte Kiffin’s Tampa 2 schemes and a lot of its struggles. The defense has surely bent, and bent a lot, but it really hasn’t broken yet. When looking at this defense, however, it is still relatively young top to bottom. And it’s about time to recognize what this current unit is doing, especially the linebackers, and what it will look like in just a couple years.
Yes, it might be premature to say that Bailey, Pullard, Dawson and Madden will turn into a Maualuga, Cushing, Matthews and Maiava-like four-some.
But in a year or two, this linebacking corps could turn out to be really special.

The third time could be the charm for No. 18 USC.
Leading the charge · Though senior tailback Marc Tyler is expected to play Saturday against Washington, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Wednesday that junior Curtis McNeal will be the team’s starter at tailback. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Since former offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian left for Seattle in 2009 to take over as coach of Washington, the Huskies have upended the Trojans in each of the last two seasons on last-second field goals from kicker Erik Folk in 2010 and 2009.
Despite recent struggles against Washington, USC (7-2, 4-2), insists what has transpired carries little bearing on Saturday’s Pac-12 matchup between the two teams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the Trojans’ annual Homecoming Game.
“Nothing last year will help us win this year,” USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley said following Tuesday’s mid-morning practice. “We’re a completely different team than we were last year, and none of that sour taste is still in my mouth.”
Though quarterback Jake Locker, a first-round selection by the NFL’s Tennessee Titans last April, is no longer under center for the Huskies (6-3, 4-2), Washington’s offense has not missed a beat this season, scoring nearly 34 points per game — compared to 21.6 points per game a season ago.
Heading Washington’s attack is tailback Chris Polk, who ranks seventh nationally with less than 122 rushing yards per contest. Polk, a one-time USC commit coming out of Redlands East Valley High, has also eclipsed 1,000 yards for the third consecutive season.
“It’s not real complicated,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of slowing down Polk, who rushed for a mere 80 yards against Oregon. “Tackle the guy really well and don’t let him fall forward.”
But even in Locker’s absence, Washington has gotten strong play from quarterback Keith Price, who has thrown for 2,133 yards and 25 touchdowns through nine games this season.
Fortunately for USC, its defense -— at least as of late — has improved markedly in its last four games, thanks in part to a concerted effort to cycle more players in and out of the lineup during the course of a game. In an era where spread offenses dominate the Pac-12 landscape, defensive players face more offensive snaps, causing them to tire more easily, according to Kiffin.
“Playing our guys every snap, especially on the front seven, was not working, because we just weren’t productive in the fourth quarter,” Kiffin said. “This year we have rotated guys in earlier in the game, regardless of the score, so that we’ll be fresher in the fourth quarter. In general, we’re in better shape.”
But perhaps offensively is where USC has been most impressive this season, averaging 33.4 points per game — 33rd nationally.
In addition to Barkley, who broke the single-game passing touchdown record at Colorado, the Trojans boast a number of talented playmakers at both wideout and tailback in sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior tailback Curtis McNeal.
Aiding McNeal this week will be the expected returns of senior tailback Marc Tyler and freshman tailback George Farmer. The tandem, which has been hampered by injuries throughout much of the season, should help bolster an already effective USC rushing attack, which combined for 243 yards on 33 carries last week against Colorado.
Even with the additions, McNeal is slated to start for the second consecutive week after gaining 87 yards on 10 carries against the Buffaloes.
“Most likely Curtis will start,” Kiffin said. “And we look for Marc to play as well.”
Though Washington’s defensive statistics appear high — it surrenders 33.4 points per game — it is important to note that the number is inflated because of games against the high-powered offenses of Nebraska, Stanford and Oregon.
Up the middle, Washington is stout against the run, allowing 4.6 yards per rush. Washington senior linebacker Cort Dennison leads the Pac-12 in tackles with 81 on the season, and defensive tackle Alameda Ta’amu is projected by some as a first-round draft pick in this spring’s NFL draft.
“We’ve got to run some wide zones, which in our system means that we cut [Ta’amu] down, which is all legal,” Kiffin said. “We’ve got to make sure that we do that, so that he’s got to be getting up and down off the ground all day long. He’s caused people a lot of problems over the last couple of years. Hopefully, we’ll be able to contain him.”
The Trojans, riding a two-game skid against the Huskies, insist things will be different come Saturday.
“They beat us the last two years,” McNeal said, hinting at a bit of frustration. “We can’t afford to let them beat us anymore.”
The game is scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m. and will be televised on FX.

Protectors of Tommy Trojan, the Victory Bell and USC traditions, the USC Trojan Knights are celebrating their 90th anniversary this year.
Traditions · The Trojan Knights, pictured here in the 1950s, have worked to bolster school spirit, especially at football games, since 1921. - Photo courtesy of Steve Johnson
Trojan Knights Alumni Director Steve Johnson said the knights will celebrate the homecoming game the way they celebrate all home games.
“We’ll wake up at 6 a.m. Saturday, maybe earlier, to set up the tailgate on Trousdale. Then we’ll enjoy food, drinks and the company of Helenes and alumni,” Johnson said. “We’ll paint ourselves at around 7:30 a.m. and 20 Knights bring the Victory Bell to the Coliseum at 9 a.m.”
Johnson has attended USC football games since he was 2 years old and has never heard fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum scream as loud as they did during this season’s game against Stanford.
“It was absolutely deafening,” Johnson said. “It was a tough loss, but the crowd was definitely a factor in the game. If we can get some of that intensity back for this game against Washington, it will help lead our team to victory.”
Trojan Knights President Phillip Larson said despite the football team’s 56-48 loss to Stanford in triple overtime and NCAA sanctions, the Trojan Knights’ spirit and passion have not been affected.
“Since 1921, we have been the guardians of Trojan tradition and school spirit,” Larson said. “The spirit has only gotten stronger and the sanctions have given Trojans a banner to rally around because bowl game or not, we’re still a great team.”
Regardless of the football team’s performance, in nine decades of existence, the Trojan Knights have helped develop some of USC’s most treasured traditions.
In 1941, six Trojan Knights dressed in powder blue to infiltrate Westwood and capture the Victory Bell during a UCLA football game. Also in the 1940s, a group of Trojan Knights found a stray dog wandering on Trousdale Parkway and named it George Tirebiter. It soon became a beloved Trojan mascot, especially after it bit Joe Bruin’s nose during a USC-UCLA football game.
In 1954, Arthur J. Gontier III, a Trojan Knight, rode a white horse to the tune of “Conquest.” Seven years later, Traveler was introduced as an official mascot of USC.
“I was terrified,” said Gontier, a 1956 USC alumnus. “All of a sudden, I was in front of 60,000 screaming fans and the guy who was supposed to ride the horse didn’t show, so I stepped up, put on a Trojan costume and rode the horse out of the tunnel.”
Gontier said although he enjoyed being a Trojan Knight and starting a long-time Trojan tradition, the organization has improved dramatically since the 1950s.
“We were in it for ourselves,” Gontier said. “Our lives pulled away from Trojan Knights, not toward it. We did not have any fraternal bond whatsoever.”
Though the Trojan Knights are not part of the Greek system, the Knights still consider themselves a fraternal organization.
“We are a brotherhood of leaders,” Trojan Knights Treasurer Vinnie Prasad said. “One of our main goals is to work together and provide better service to the surrounding community.”
Among the Trojan Knights’ signature philanthropies is its pumpkin carving campaign where Knights carve pumpkins with students of West 32nd Elementary School for Halloween. In addition, the Trojan Knights hold annual bone marrow drives. Last spring’s drive yielded several potentially life-saving matches for cancer patients.
“There’s a lot of criteria to be a Knight,” Prasad said. “You have to know all about USC traditions and school history, but you also have to be selfless and have the drive to make a positive difference on campus and in the community.”
Great article, and I have to say, those Knights in the photo look pretty sharp in their slacks, sweaters, and ties–I hope that tradition has endured. 
I saw this article recently in the L.A. Times (21 Nov 2011): http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-1122-usc-ucla-rivalry-20111122,0,5469354.story 
>Three Trojan Knights, one in a suit and bow tie, dance in the rain
>to Fleetwood Mac’s “Tusk,” part of an hourly ritual that includes ringing
>the Victory Bell and bellowing a USC chant. 
Now that’s Trojan spirit! I’m proud to be a USC Trojan and to be represented by these confident young men. Fight on!
Great article about the Knights, Conrad! Always love seeing those guys going crazy at football games!

West 27th Place was awarded platinum Leadership in Energy Environment Development platinum certification  Thursday, becoming the first housing complex in Southern California to receive the environmental recognition.
Gone green · West 27th Place was built with the goal of achieving platinum certification, which has the strictest standards for sustainability. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The U.S. Green Building Council awards the LEED platinum certification to buildings that meet the council’s highest standard of sustainability features, according to a press release from the management of West 27th Place.
West 27th Place, located on Figueroa Street, was built with the goal of achieving the certification.
“We are honored to receive such a high-level distinction from LEED and hope that we can be trendsetters in having the remainder of the student housing industry follow suit,” Al Rabil, managing partner of West 27th Place’s property group, said in the release.
The building’s managers estimate they cut 95 percent of construction-related waste by using modular building, a process in which units are built off-site and assembled at the building. The complex has Energy Star-compliant appliances, a salt water pool and an irrigation system for water conservation.

About 75 students and USC Hospitality workers attended a meet and greet hosted by Students Coalition Against Labor Exploitation on Thursday night to raise awareness about hospitality workers’ recent grievances.
Speaking up · Organizers of SCALE met with USC Hospitality employees to discuss employees’ grievances, including shortened hours. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Workers have raised concerns about decreased hours in the last few months.
SCALE co-president Tandia Elijio said the group is committed to creating a socially responsible university.
“We want these employees to know we care about their issues, which is why we are providing a forum to make their voices are heard,” Elijio said.
SCALE members split attendees into small discussion groups that included both students and worker to facilitate better understanding of workers’ concerns among students.
Julia Wang, co-president of SCALE, said she hopes the issue can be resolved promptly, stressing that student involvement is crucial.
“The best thing right now is for students to get out and support the cause,” Wang said. “The more people that know about the problem, the more people will act.”
Workers in attendance represented nearly every sector of USC Hospitality, from Everybody’s Kitchen to the University Club. Many said they have had their hours shortened from eight a day to as low as six.
Trinidad Leyva and Reyna Sanabria, who have worked at EVK for more than 30 years, expressed concern about the hour reductions.
“The management claimed over the summer that we would get our hours back once the students returned in the fall,” Leyva said. “But it is November now and they still haven’t followed through.”
Sanabria said the situation has worsened, but hopes they can resolve the situation with USC Hospitality.
“We’ve had our problems with the administration before, but this is by far the worst,” Sanabria said. “I hope things can be resolved soon because we don’t want to do anything drastic.”
Hospitality administration said a significant decrease in sales has forced it to choose between its employees and a fiscally prudent department.
“Instead of laying people off, we are trying to get creative,” Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger said.
Though every venue has varied levels of success, according to USC Hospitality, Carl’s Jr. has been hit particularly hard with sales that have nearly halved since 2007. Trojan Grounds has seen a 20 percent decrease in sales, which resulted in the temporary suspension of its 24-hour service last year.
“We want to clarify that we are not cutting employee hours down enough to make them ineligible for benefits,” Klinger said. “We have not laid off a single hourly worker in over two years.”
Klingler said one of the major reasons staff hours were being cut is students increasingly taking advantage of the new, off-campus eateries, which results in a loss of revenue for USC dining.
“Students have more places to spend their money and are not utilizing venues on campus,” Klinger said. “It’s basic economics. We can’t support the amount of workers we used to.”
Still, many newer workers, like Wok Bar chef James France, said they feel skeptical about the legitimacy of the Trojan Family.
“The administration likes to talk about the Trojan Family all the time,” France said. “So what’s that make us? The foster children?”
Unionized USC Hospitality workers met with university officials last month to express concerns about the reduction of their weekly hours and loss of benefits, which they said resulted in financial hardships and a more stressful work environment.
The meeting between the union, university officials and hospitality employees ended on a positive note, Klinger said.
Hospitality administration staff are currently in the process of creating a compromise to present to the union, which Klingler said should lead to successful negotiations in the coming months.
I am impressed with the authors who wrote this well written in-depth article, on a topic that needs to be addressed.
 Although the economy is in a recession, the USC Hospitality workers really do make a difference in the everyday lives of the USC students.
 It’s a real shame that  fast food chains are popping up all around the outside of USC, thus causing the students to spend their money there, instead of on campus.
 One must always remember to take care of “family” first. The USC students should band together and try to spend on campus, to help generate more money to enable workers to keep their jobs.
 I think the USC students should notice that their dollars spent on campus will enhance the jobs of people that truly have their best interests at heart.
Authors: Thank you for putting Klinger’s comments in there.  Too often, one side is totally ignored.
The socialists at SCALE are back again making news that isn’t news
These workers are experiencing a “More Stressful Work Enviornment”? Hours are being cut?
Join the rest of the world–this whole thing sounds like a bunch of wining entitled adults who refuse to except the new world economic reality.
We simply cannot afford to live like we have been living and the people like USC, who have been providing this lifestyle, simply must adjust to the new reality and cut back–or perish.
Grow up everyone–you think you are the only ones going through this? The whole world is!
> you think you are the only ones going
> through this? The whole world is!
“The whole world?”  Really?
That’s funny. I don’t think the USC administrators are.
Or the coaching staff of the athletic teams.
Or SC’s lawyers who get them out of trouble when they break the law.
Or the consultants SC hires to union bust. 
I think they are all doing just fine–getting bonuses, even.

In Oakland, Calif., big brother is watching.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Police officers in certain cities around the country are now allowed to wear video cameras the size of pagers on their chests. It seems like a good enough idea; police actions with the public will be subject to monitoring, and evidence can now be provided in the utmost level of clarity.
The passage of this law brings to question how far the scope of privacy is going to be pushed, and how the future will be if laws such as the personal camera continue to be passed. The whole affair is very Orwellian, and the law represents an extreme form of paranoia and monitoring.
The issue with personal video surveillance is that it overrides the right to privacy, and, as of now, rules of discretion in using the personal camera are not concrete.
The only established rule of consent regarding wearing the cameras is that officers are asked to briefly mention they are filming to any members of the public they encounter.
According to National Public Radio, wearable cameras have already posed problems. Cameras are extremely unsympathetic to potentially sensitive cases. Say, for example, a police officer walks into a scene of child abuse or domestic abuse.
To walk into a situation of such gravity constitutes a breach of privacy. The last thing a victim of an awful circumstance needs is a camera staring them in the face. Proponents of wearable cameras say this problem can easily be solved by just turning off the camera. But a stipulation of wearing the camera is that once police officers start recording, they cannot stop at the risk of making it seem as if the recording is censored.
The cameras, which proponents claim promote an honest depiction of events, could actually do quite the opposite. It’s important to remember who has the power in police-civilian interactions. In most cases, it’s the police officer. The only people with complete access to the tapes are the authorities.
In a recent event in Oakland, NPR reported a victim shot by a police officer was denied access to the wearable camera recordings before his trial. In such a case, the tapes can be used against the victim. There’s no way to guarantee honesty, even if an instrument of supposed honesty is present. There is always a chance of corruption and a camera won’t simply eradicate it. People will just find ways around restrictions.
To be granted access to recordings is often a long and arduous process as most dealings with city officials are. So the personal camera fails in the respects of honesty and efficiency.
The most disturbing feature of the personal camera is that an officer is not allowed to stop recording — even if they are asked to stop by civilians. It’s unnerving that people have no control over their sense of privacy.
It appears as if 1984 has manifested itself in 2011.

Stories of suspected police misconduct, which could have been easily resolved or prevented had there been video surveillance, have become frequent. Police departments in certain areas around the country are beginning to catch on, as many now require officers to wear small cameras on their uniforms to record their time on duty.
These small cameras designed by companies like Vievu and Taser to be worn by police officers, can help deter police misconduct and curb crime.
Officer Ben Sias of Bainbridge Island, Wash., who first tested the camera, says he considers it to be a sort of “insurance policy” against claims of police brutality or corruption, according to National Public Radio.
Not only does this benefit police officers, it promotes law enforcement’s accountability to the public.
In a perfect world, police-citizen exchanges would be peaceful, orderly and legal, but this world is far from perfect. Many instances where police use excessive force against citizens and make illegal arrests and searches have occurred, but cameras have rarely been a factor in these cases.
If officers are aware that everything they do while on duty is recorded and can be used as evidence against them should they err, most questionable actions they might consider taking will likely not occur. With the threat of being fired or  prosecuted for a crime, officers are forced to better serve the public.
Cameras can also alleviate the problem of violence against officers. There are many examples of citizens reacting violently to being stopped or confronted by police, often resulting in the senseless deaths of devoted public servants.
Just as the camera policy will likely curb police misconduct, it would also remind potentially violent citizens that their actions are being directly recorded from the vantage point of the officer they might seek to harm.
Some opponents, however, feel it is an invasion of privacy for police to record without explicit permission.
Surveillance cameras in most areas of business record workday occurrences are there to promote the safety of employees and customers, so what is the difference in a police department using small cameras?
Sure, police forces are publicly supported, but this is all the more reason to record interactions with citizens. The presence of a small camera ensures that police act appropriately toward citizens with whom they come into contact because any violation of rights or overstepping of bounds is guaranteed to be on video and can be used as evidence against them.
Because virtually everything in public is already recorded on cameras, adding cameras to public law enforcement officer’s uniforms is not an additional infraction of individual privacy.
Instead, it protects against the violation of individual rights by corrupt police officers and promotes peaceful interaction.

Sometimes you want a movie with a side of epic. The scale doesn’t get much grander than mythology, where gods and heroes battle for the fate of the world, and running off with another guy’s wife can bring down the wrath of Olympus. As such, American film and mythology seem like they would be Cupid-stricken lovers. But American film has proven an erratic partner and has crafted its fair share of epic bombs.
Mighty mortal · Henry Cavill plays Theseus in Hollywood’s latest mythological adaptation Immortals, which features a heroic quest to topple the megalomaniac King Hyperion’s reign. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
 
Immortals, opening this weekend, is Hollywood’s most recent jaunt into the days of Homer. Starring Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke, Immortals follows the Greek hero Theseus, chosen by Zeus to take down the megalomaniac King Hyperion. Early reviews are scarce, but so far Immortals looks like the lovechild of 300 and the original Clash of the Titans (1981).
Virtually all stories have their roots in mythology. The Godfather invokes the succession myth, which played out in Greek mythology with Zeus, who became king after he vanquished his father Kronos, who had overthrown his own father, the sky god Ouranus. And the Coen brothers’ O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a modern retelling of The Odyssey.
Yet actual myths — anything from Greek to Norse to Breton, have all appeared on the silver screen. Some are grand. Others are grotesque.
Greek mythology films were most common in Hollywood between the late ’50s and ’80s. 1963’s Jason and the Argonauts and the original Clash were so earnestly sword-and-sandal, audiences could not help but be charmed. Jason quests for the Golden Fleece and fights everything from harpies to the Hydra. In Clash of the Titans, Perseus manhandles witches and slaughters Medusa.
Norse mythology has manifested in spirit more than actual retelling. For example, the summer blockbuster Thor, adapted from the comic book, is less of a myth and more of a mythology-inspired superhero story. Nicolas Winding Refn’s Valhalla Rising, however, takes the themes from Norse mythology and crafts a savage war song when a grizzled, one-eyed Norse warrior encounters Christians heading to Jerusalem.
Cinema also embraces the Breton myth of King Arthur. Who can deny a story of knights, witchcraft, incest and adultery? Two of the best adaptations are wildly different. Excalibur, despite its ’80s hokeyness, conveys the story’s inherit tragedy, serenaded by Richard Wagner and Carl Orff. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is bereft of all tragedy but brilliantly satiric, with parodies such as the Killer Rabbit channeling the Questing Beast.
Yet, sometimes Hollywood seems to think it can one-up Homer and Virgil. Studios have had a recent proclivity for taking out the magic and making myths quasi-historical and edgy. This is undoubtedly inspired by historical films cast with a mythic sheen like 300. Though it is unlikely Leonidas had to face down mutant rhinos and demonic Persians, the 300 curb-stomped the box office.
But the door does not swing both ways. Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood (2010) and Antoine Fuqua’s King Arthur (2004), upped the medieval squalor and downplayed the folklore. Both movies were also critical bombs that suffered from shoddy screenwriting and dull, studio-injected stories.
One of the only films to nearly escape this cinematic Tartarus is 2004’s Troy, which retells the Trojan War with fewer gods and more abs. Brad Pitt and Eric Bana nail their roles as Achilles and Hector, but the film stumbles over a subpar script and an utter lack of chemistry between Paris and Helen. Not to mention the real Trojan War most likely arose from trade and tariff spats, not a home-wrecking stud muffin.
That’s not to say magical mythology films are always good. The recent 3-D remake of Clash of the Titans had a distinct shortage of fight scenes, titans and character development.
A sadder failure was Robert Zemeckis’s 2007 Beowulf. Writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary had some interesting twists on the epic poem — Grendel’s demon mother seduces King Hrothgar to produce Grendel, the murderous beast Hrothgar needs Beowulf to destroy. When Beowulf finds the demoness’ cave, the grappling in the poem becomes a tussle of a different nature. Though British literature teachers might groan, it was an interesting idea. Unfortunately, it was hamstringed by Zemeckis’s zombie-eyed, lumbering stop-motion characters.
Mythology, spanning cultures and millennia, keeps our archetypes and primordial stories alive. There is something satisfying about myths — the depravity of some stories and the valiance in others, the larger-than-life characters who still have glimmers of intriguing humanity. Film, as unreliable of a medium as it can be, is just another way to keep old stories alive. If Immortals turns out to be a dud, at least viewers can play God of War to quench his or her mythology fix.

Lars Von Trier is a provocative filmmaker, who has no qualms about making people uneasy with what he shows on the big screen. Antichrist was arguably the darkest picture of his career, a bleak, incoherent and infuriating reflection of his own clinical depression.
It is fitting, then, that depression is the prime subject matter of Trier’s latest picture Melancholia, an apocalyptic film that goes against its own conventions by celebrating the end of all human life, not leaving viewers with any semblance of hope for the future. This becomes immediately clear when viewers witness the film’s astounding seven-minute-long dialogue-less prologue, which consists of nothing but mesmerizing, surreal images of the Earth’s destruction via collision with the titular planet Melancholia — set to the strains of Wagner.
By presenting such a brilliant sequence from the outset and rendering the apocalypse as visually poetic, Trier removes any possibility of his characters surviving and transforms a traditionally tragic turn of events into a desirable outcome of awe and beauty.
Though the selection of music and imagery in the opening might give the impression of an epic disaster flick on the scale of 2012, what follows is an intimate character study in two parts that shows the days leading up to Earth’s destruction, with the first focusing on Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and the second on her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).
Trier carefully and artfully limits the film’s scope, never leaving the beautiful estate that ultimately becomes the main characters’ inescapable prison and rarely wandering outside either Claire or Justine’s points of view. Melancholia is remarkably short on exposition and there is little indication of how the wider world reacts to the existence and threat of Melancholia. Gradually, it becomes clear Trier’s film is not so much about the apocalypse as it is about examining how human behavior changes when the pressures of society cease to exist.
Part 1, which depicts Justine’s luxurious wedding reception in the style of a home video with jerky hand-held cinematography, comes off as a cross between a drama and a quirky, black comedy. Key to the excellent humor here is John (Kiefer Sutherland), Claire’s rich husband, who is constantly at odds with her unorthodox family, especially his cantankerous mother-in-law Gaby (Charlotte Rampling). Part 1 also establishes Justine as an unraveling sociopath incapable of acting within society in juxtaposition to her sister, a successful conformist and control freak.
Conversely, Part 2 transforms Melancholia into a psychological horror film, depicting Claire’s gradual psychological breakdown in tandem with Justine’s recovery from depression as a means of reflecting the collapse of society in reaction to the eschaton. The humor gives way to tension and suspense, with some of the most nerve-wracking moments involving Claire using a tiny device to see whether the other planet is either approaching or receding from Earth. A simple and brilliant relation between two shots of the planet through the device tells the audience all it needs to know, in effect translating Claire’s sense of utter terror to the viewer.
Dunst and Gainsbourg give convincing performances and imbue their archetypal characters with actual depth, though Gainsbourg inarguably renders her character the more sympathetic of the two. Nonetheless, Trier supports Dunst’s pessimistic and nihilistic worldviews, a fact that becomes clear in the picture’s riveting final scenes, which take the audience back to the beginning in which it implores a welcome embrace with the world’s end.
In terms of visual splendor, Trier never manages to top the opening’s depiction of planetary destruction, but both parts contain their fair share of fantastic imagery, such as the two sisters horseback riding through misty castle grounds, small air balloons glowing in the dark or Dunst bathing in the beautiful luminescence of Melancholia.
The film ultimately emerges as a genuine success for Trier and one of the most riveting films of 2011, while simultaneously creating an absorbing character study and a unique rendition of the apocalypse. Whereas most apocalyptic films exhibit uplifting messages, promising life will somehow resume after the world ends, Melancholia argues the end is inevitable, and there is nothing one can do but accept and welcome what comes.
It’s a provocative stance that many might not agree with, but Trier makes a laudable and convincing case for it.
