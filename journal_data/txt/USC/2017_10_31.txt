On Tuesday, No. 17 USC began preparation for its Pac-12 clash with quarterback Khalil Tate and No. 22 Arizona in what will be another key battle for the Pac-12 South Division race. 
Trojans prepare for Tate 
This Saturday, USC faces one of the most unique and dynamic players in the nation in Tate. The Los Angeles native, who played at the same high school as junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett and redshirt junior wide receiver Jalen Greene (among several other Trojans), has taken the college football world by storm in the last four weeks. 
Arizona is 4-0 since Tate took over as starting quarterback against Colorado. He rushed for a record-breaking 327 yards in that game and has not looked back. 
“He’s doing a phenomenal job both being a weapon in the running game averaging about 150 yards a game right now,” head coach Clay Helton said. “But also, I’m impressed with his progress as a thrower over the last year.” 
In preparing for such a dynamic dual threat quarterback, USC used freshman wide receiver Randal Grimes as a scout-team quarterback on Tuesday. Grimes was an accomplished signal caller in high school, leading his team to a Nevada state championship from under center. 
While he will not be facing off directly against Tate on Saturday, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold is looking forward to what will be a duel between two of the Pac-12’s preeminent quarterbacks. 
“I think it’s something to look forward to,” Darnold said. “It’s fun to be able to play someone that electric. It’ll definitely test me mentally, if he breaks off a huge run — how am I going to bounce back, and vice versa.” 
Stephen Carr nearing return 
The Trojans have been without freshman running back Stephen Carr for four games, since he suffered a foot injury against Washington State. On Tuesday, Carr made significant progress toward his return, as he participated in full speed drills at practice. 
“I was out here cutting, spinning, jumping, all of that,” Carr said. “I could do everything that I could before.” 
Carr took off in an explosive start to his collegiate career rushing for 309 yards on 5.9 yards per carry before going down with the foot injury. Over the first four games of the season, Carr and junior running back Ronald Jones II looked like they would emerge as one of the most exciting running back tandems in all of college football.
“This is my first time ever being injured,” Carr said. “It’s always good watching my homies go out there and succeed and make plays and all that. But on my end, it’s tough knowing that I could be out there making plays too helping the team and benefiting the team in some type of way.” 
While Carr was optimistic that he could play this weekend, Helton offered a more reserved response. 
“One: let’s see his pain level tomorrow,” Helton said. “Two: [getting into] football shape also has to happen. He got a lot of great work today and looked really good … but we’ll see where he is at the end of the week.” 
Injury Report 
After returning to the field against Arizona State, junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin is back on the shelf. On Tuesday, Helton ruled him out for Arizona, saying that he failed to receive medical clearance for his lingering toe injury. Gustin has been plagued by injuries for the majority of this season after initially undergoing surgery for a broken toe in Week 3. 
In addition to Gustin, junior cornerback Iman Marshall (knee) and redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. (shoulder) were both held out with lingering injuries. In good news considering the team’s laundry list of ailments, Helton announced that freshman redshirt running back Vavae Malepeai did not suffer structural damage to his knee after going down on Saturday. 
The team will have to score plenty to beat Arizona. Coach Clancy Pendergast has no idea how to contain an option QB
the likes of Tate more dynamic than the. ND one.

The No. 14 women’s golf team defeated Northwestern in the East Lake Cup match play semifinals in Atlanta on Tuesday. Junior Robynn Ree, sophomore Allisen Corpuz and freshman Alyaa Abdulghany led the team with 3-and-2 wins as the team took revenge on Arizona.
The two teams last faced off in the 2017 NCAA championship semifinals. In a day of close play, the Wildcats barely edged out the Trojans in extra holes to continue onto the finals, where they were defeated by Arizona State.
For the Trojans, Tuesday’s win provided a much-needed chance at redemption. It also reflected a change in approach by head coach Andrea Gaston, who adjusted the types of competitions she selected for this season.
“I’m proud of them all,” head coach Andrea Gaston said. “Last year, we played a lot of match play but in the end I felt it didn’t help us as much, so I entered us in more stroke play this year.”
The first point for the Trojans came from Abdulghany, who took down Northwestern’s Sarah Cho in a tight finish. The pair was head-to-head for the first six holes until Abdulghany pulled ahead quickly to a three-hole lead. She then fell to one over par, but finished with a bogey on 16 to draw out the victory.
Ree was the next to score with a victory over Stephanie Lau. She started similarly close with her opponent, but leapt out to a six-hole lead and held onto her lead for the Trojans’ second point, finishing with a par of 16.
The strongest start for the Trojans came from Corpuz, who never fell behind her opponent, Brooke Riley. She teetered between 1-over par and 2-over par throughout the final half of her holes, but was able to clean up the match for a USC team victory with a birdie. 
Although their scores did not contribute to the overall team score, sophomores Divya Manthena and Muni He both competed in the semifinals as well. Manthena held a lead over Janet Mao out 2-over when play finished, while He was trailing in her match with Hannah Kim when the day ended for both teams.
USC will now face Stanford in the title match of the East Lake Cup on Wednesday. The Cardinal already took down Arizona State, the defending national champions, to advance to the tournament’s final. 
Before the finals, the Trojans have had a mixed season in team play. They started strong with a first place finish at the Minnesota Invitational in September with a 9-stroke lead over Michigan State. The team then took seventh out of 12 teams at the Annika Invitational in Minnesota in October. 
Those two tournaments have been the only team competitions of the season, with individual athletes competing at the Pac-12 Preview in Kona, Hawaii. The East Lake Cup gave the Trojans an opportunity to compete against several of the top teams in the country.
“Being invited to East Lake was spectacular for us and is a great experience,” Gaston said. “They all know it’s a different game. You have to watch what your opponent is doing but still play the golf course. I also told them, let’s just have fun out there. It’s beautiful.”
Your first paragraph makes no sense. What was the revenge on Arizona when the match was with Northwestern?
Obviously you meant when they last met in Arizona I am guessing. You need to proof read your article. This is
probably the lowest ranked team in many , many years under Coach Gaston.

The Los Angeles Chargers didn’t give up when they had their backs against the wall in the red zone against the New England Patriots. But the efforts of head coach Anthony Lynn weren’t enough to snag a win over the Pats in Foxborough on Sunday. Still, we learned that Lynn’s Bolts seem worthy of a playoff berth when they put pressure on opponents at certain points throughout the game.
After starting 0-4, the Chargers won the next three games, while special teams play, notably from electrifying return man Travis Benjamin, supplemented the resolve of quarterback Phillip Rivers. And they won the next three games. Thus, beating the Patriots would have been the icing on the cake that would have reset the Bolts’ record to 4-4, a .500 winning percentage which offers at least some hope for success. 
The AFC West doesn’t have a definitive second-place squad, as the Oakland Raiders (3-5), Chargers and Denver Broncos (3-4) sit behind the Kansas City Chiefs (6-2). The Broncos’ defense is one of the best in the league, but battling the Chiefs on Monday night, the offense anchored by quarterback Trevor Siemian looked rickety. And I still feel the AFC West could draw two playoff teams, leaving Los Angeles a slight opportunity.
As far as the competition versus the Patriots went, you’d think Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram would considerably disrupt the rhythm of New England quarterback Tom Brady. But the Patriots’ offensive line performed well enough to neutralize them, as the Chargers’ pass rushing duo was funneled past Brady and usually failed to reach him due to the QB’s swift release and pocket elusiveness.
“We didn’t get to him enough,” Lynn said. “But you know, he is a master of moving around in the pocket and sliding and making guys miss.”
The Patriots weren’t hitting strings of completions down the field, as the Chargers were comfortable limiting Brady to his backfield options. However, the running back group of Dion Lewis, Rex Burkhead, Mike Gillislee and James White caused all sorts of problems for the Chargers’ defense. Burkhead and White combined for 153 receiving yards on 12 receptions. Lewis led the charge with 44 yards rushing. 
New England gained yards and moved the chains play after play on some drives, killing the clock on the way to the red zone. The Patriots attempted six field goals on the day, thanks to Los Angeles’ stiffening as Brady inched closer to the end zone. 
While the Charger defense held the Pats to only 21 points, Benjamin made a mistake that altered the outlook of this contest, handing the Patriots 2 points when he reversed field on a punt return before being tackled in the end zone for a safety. The former University of Miami standout looked like he was trying to turn the momentum in his team’s favor, but Belichick’s special teams had probably been working on situational defending all week. 
Playing an offense like New England’s, one that can advance the ball in a hurry, Lynn knew his offense would have to perform up to snuff. They weren’t up to the task this week. Tight end Hunter Henry had served a key role in the Chargers’ recent victories, and the Patriots held him in check. Keenan Allen reeled in five catches for 64 yards, which was the best stat line for L.A.’s wide receivers. 
Without Allen and Henry operating at high levels, Rivers found himself hung out to dry. Antonio Gates’ hands are still very strong, but he’s not as dynamic as he once was. Rookie wide receiver Mike Williams missed significant time to start the season and is getting accustomed to his new NFL surroundings. 
The burden of someone needing to step up fell on the shoulders of running back Melvin Gordon, whose 87-yard touchdown run propelled the Chargers to a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. Gordon bounced outside and took advantage of a seam left open by an ill-gapped Patriot defense. But Gordon wasn’t consistently dominant. He would gain only 45 more yards by the end of the game.
This on-and-off offensive attack continues to be a problem for the Chargers. What sort of continuity has to exist for them to get 30 points or more on the board? They scored 27 points against the New York Giants in early October and average around 18.8 points per game, which is good for 22nd in the league rankings. Rivers’ ability to get the ball down the field has them ranking 10th in pass yards. So it’s not like the Bolts have a terrible offense. 
Some reason for optimism is the degree of defensive execution. While one of the worst units against the run, the Chargers have only allowed an average of 19.0 points per game, better than the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos. 
But eight weeks into the 2017 regular season, the Chargers have five losses, and that number is what counts the most.

Vocalists and professors in Thornton’s jazz program Kathleen Grace (right) and Sara Gazarek performed alongside the Thornton Jazz Orchestra on Monday night. Photo by Junyi Li | Daily Trojan
On Monday night, the Thornton Jazz Orchestra took the stage at Carson Center to pay tribute to one of the genre’s pioneers, Ella Fitzgerald. Six months after what would have been the singer’s 100th birthday, her music proved capable of standing the test of time, filling the air with swinging notes as band and audience members alike reminisced on her legacy.
For those less familiar with Fitzgerald’s career, the concert doubled as a history lesson thanks to moments of reflection between songs. Conductor Bob Mintzer imparted his extensive knowledge on the crowd whenever possible, speaking on Fitzgerald’s early work with Chick Webb’s band as well as some of the other highlights of her career. Mintzer delved into his own personal anecdotes about Fitzgerald (including the fact that he used to play basketball with the son of acclaimed composer Jerry Bock, whose song “Too Close for Comfort” Fitzgerald famously covered), and his dialogue helped create a more intimate experience, giving the audience more than just classical music.
Kathleen Grace was one of the two vocalists who covered Fitzgerald’s songs in the performance, and went into detail about how vital the First Lady of Song was in her own jazz career. Also a professor in the Jazz  Studies and Jazz Voice Program, Grace mentioned how she often instructs her students to study live tapes of Fitzgerald’s performances to improve their musicianship.
“Especially her live recordings, I’ll give to my students who are working on swing,” Grace said. “Nobody swings like Ella; she’d swing even when she didn’t want to.”
For saxophonist Chris Sullivan, a doctoral student pursuing jazz studies, Fitzgerald’s music, as well as that of other early jazz musicians, is a treasure he doesn’t often get to experience with an audience.
“You don’t have a whole lot of opportunities to play it in public,” Sullivan said. “It’s stuff that we all practice, study and enjoy on our own time, and it’s a total treat to be able to play it in a public setting.”
Playing songs from “Take The A Train” to “You’ll Have to Swing It, Mr. Paganini,” the band explored all sides of Fitzgerald’s catalogue. Many songs carried a light, infectious bounce, while others slowed down the tempo to truly bring out the emotion.
Sara Gazarek, the other featured vocalist and a professor in Thornton’s jazz studies program, took pleasure in channeling Fitzgerald’s high-energy persona onstage. Sharing her personal recollection of reading the original jazz charts for “On the Sunny Side of the Street” at the Library of Congress, she brought her own flair to the performance. 
At times, it can be difficult for the band to rotate between singers during the show, but Sullivan said he never had to alter his playing style to fit either voice. Speaking to the character of both Gazarek and Grace, he mentioned how there was little for the band to worry about when covering Fitzgerald’s classics on stage. 
“They both sing so well, and their musicianship is so fantastic that they make our job easy,” he said.
For Grace, Fitzgerald’s bright spirit and genuine love of the music is what set her apart from her peers. Dubbed the First Lady of Song, Fitzgerald was instrumental in her development as a young musician, ensuring that her songs will always hold a sentimental place in her heart.
“Pretty much any jazz musician I know has had their time falling in love with her music, her tone and the pure joy for life that comes across when she sings,” Grace said. “Getting to do these charts and arrangements that are so evocative of baby musician memories, it’s very meaningful.”

Los Angeles-based artist Sayre Gomez’s second solo exhibit, Déjà Vu, is on view at Ghebaly Gallery until Nov. 18. The show is laid out like a maze, the rooms folding into each other with paintings playing on the perspective of the ones that preceded. The multimedia works range from short videos playing on a loop to illusionistic scenic paintings, the common thread between them lying in the theme of restraint.
Gomez’s Déjà Vu begins with a video loop of a scene from the 1941 Disney film Dumbo in which an angry gorilla shakes the bars of its animated prison. The show continues with a large acrylic painting of a set of double doors, shut closed and obscuring a backdrop of a pink-hued sunset. Following the piece is a series of acrylic works exploring the concept of focus; a fence overgrown with vines is portrayed clearly, whereas the background it is caging is faded to a point of nearly uncomfortable ambiguity. In one, several buildings comprise the background; in another, two women. Each harnesses the power to make the viewer feel trapped on the outside. 
Another double-doored painting appears. This one features large disheveled pieces of paper, blocking any visual entry into the space. The reflective realism of the windows invites the viewer while the subject matter raises further questions as to the installation’s thematic statement. The next room offers several pieces that appear to be made of wood with stickers mounted on top of them, reminiscent of a child’s dresser. In a piece called “Dreamer,” a red mug and lit candlestick overlooks a gloomy backyard. With titles like “Bad Boy,” “World Won’t Listen” and “Good Boy,” the wood and sticker works further embody an adolescent angst, at once trapped in emotion and simultaneously trying to project that emotion onto the world around Gomez by utilizing surfaces readily available to him.
Los Angeles-based artist Sayre Gomez’s second solo exhibit ‘Déjà Vu’ will be on view at Ghebaly Gallery through Nov. 18. Natalie Pashaie | Daily Trojan
By experimenting with perspectives and confinement, Gomez is also commenting on distribution of power. This is accentuated by the painting of a fighter pilot who looks like a character pulled out of Star Wars — childlike within its own subject matter, the character also doubles as a figure of power. The straightforward portrait style establishes its dominance, as the viewer is directly confronted by the harsh figure, but it is starkly trapped within the frame. Thus, we become aware that we are free, and in this way, we are released back out into the world.
Restraint and captivity are themes repeated throughout the exhibition, whether that be through the stern, closed doors painted by Gomez or through the hyper-focused, magnified nature of the wood-and-sticker paintings. The show transitions with paintings of views from the outside world to views from the inside and, in doing so, establishes a journey of psychological introspection. The ambiguity of the artist’s scenic “outside” paintings is bound to offer the viewer a familiar view, but the haziness makes them cold, uncertain and consequently foreign.

Just this weekend, my parents swung by USC and drove me to San Gabriel — you know, where the real Chinese restaurants are, the ones whose cutlery collections are comprised exclusively of chopsticks and where the chatter is conducted in Chinese. Considering how I’m living on a diet of cereal — basically just sweetened air —  I pounced on the opportunity to finally fill my stomach with something a little more substantial.  
In the midst of shoveling rice down my throat, however, I was startled with a revelation; there was no way I would ever be able to come here without my parents, who always ordered for me without hesitation. I couldn’t read the names of the dishes on the menu. And the English translations were so absurdly half hearted that if I tried to order “Green Tender Bathing in Ginger Sauce,” I’m pretty sure I would keel over in embarrassment as the waiter eyes me with disdain. 
Both my parents are fairly fluent in English, so that’s the language we converse in; or, occasionally, I can understand enough to scrape by when they revert back to their native language. But my lack of bilingual competency is merely symptomatic of a larger condition, where my identity is primarily bound up in mainstream Western culture. 
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
I know European and American art history inside out, but I haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of Asian art. I’m well-versed in the Western literary canon, but the only book I’ve ever finished in Chinese is a first-grade translation of The Little Mermaid. My only exposure to Chinese television and radio programming is as a background hum when my dad has it on, barely registering as a blip on my radar. 
Last summer, when I traveled to China for the first time in five years to visit my grandparents, no one batted an eye — as long as I kept my mouth shut. My features are quintessentially Asian, invariable, inescapable, amplifying the dissonance for passersby when an effortless stream of English poured out my mouth. Several terms float around to describe someone like me — “banana,” “Twinkie.” Technically, they’re slurs, but considering how common this phenomenon is I don’t think it’s necessarily degrading or disgraceful, nor do I think it’s so black and white that gravitating toward one equates to shunning the other. 
Of course, now I regret blowing off all those Chinese lessons in elementary school, but at this point I’ve become so untethered from my “roots” that I’m not sure that I can find my way back. And, in an ironic twist of fate, I’m a linguistics major; for someone who claims to love language, it’s pretty pathetic that I can only profess my passion in one.

Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before Congress on Tuesday about the thousands of fake accounts on their platforms that spewed misinformation throughout the 2016 election. The issue of Russian information warfare and political propaganda has been closely tied, in the public imagination, with the issue of “fake news” — fake stories distributed to unwitting American citizens with the intent of shifting their voting decisions. It seems to me that important distinctions must be made. The Russian misinformation campaigns of 2016 and the purported proliferation of fake stories are different phenomena, and the first is much more serious and much more legitimate of a concern than the second. Let’s focus on the second.
What exactly is “fake news?” Is it fake stories distributed by untrustworthy and unprofessional alternative media sources, like the infamous Pizzagate reports, which alleged Democratic Party leadership ran a human trafficking ring? If it is, then yes, it’s certainly a problem, but why all the fuss about it now? This same phenomenon — better termed “conspiracy theories” than “fake news” — has been influencing our politics throughout the 21st century.
The 9/11 truthers, conspiracy theories that Halliburton started the Iraq War, questions about the legitimacy of Barack Obama’s birth certificate, the long specter of climate science denial — all these have proliferated on alternative media sites, left and right. More importantly, they have been strongest among the opponents of whichever president was in power at the time. They’re particularly strong around presidential campaigns.
 And the people who consume them — always heavily partisan minorities of the population —don’t seem to be people who, when exposed to “real news,” would change up their narratives and let the scales fall from their eyes. It’s not like these people are being manipulated — they’re manipulating themselves by feeding themselves ridiculous narratives.
That brings up another potential definition. Is “fake news” more a question of pernicious, slanderous and factually questionable (but not necessarily falsifiable) narratives informed by very specific worldviews, especially ones peddled by radical publications with an axe to grind? Breitbart News, The Blaze and the Drudge Report come to mind on the right; Truthout, CounterPunch, and Alternet come to mind on the left.

But if you want to use the literal definition of “fake,” these websites aren’t “fake news.” They might not have the same sense of journalistic propriety as CNN or Fox News or MSNBC, but they’re not made-up events and yellow journalism. They’re more describable as entertainment sites that cater to particular ideological audiences by picking up unimportant tidbits of information, including unverified rumors, and spinning them into stories bigger than they really are. These stories happen to align with particular world views and get repeated until they’re generally accepted as true. The Benghazi hysteria, for example, or the notion that Russian interference actually tipped the 2016 election and defeated Hillary Clinton. But that’s not “fake news” — that’s just mass media opinion journalism.
Sure, maybe it’d be better if we all had rational Socratic discussions based on Associated Press reports. But let’s not kid ourselves — a lot of our own news-reading is a reading of opinion and analysis that suits our preferences and is designed to shape or justify or develop or inform our basic world views, not challenge or change them. When we see facts and stories that go against them, we often find ways to explain them away with our narratives. You can be more factually informed than others, but in opinion journalism, no one, except maybe dedicated fact-checkers and reporters, is “unbiased.” It’s a thing of naturally flawed human epistemology, and it is the epitome of hubris to suggest that one’s own epistemology is pure, unvarnished, objective truth, especially when it’s tied up with social values, political realities and other mental maps and reference points specific to our temporal experiences.
It’s widely understood that Facebook and other sites curate stories based on search histories and similar data. The narrative about “fake news” seems to suggest that if tech companies curated more effectively, if people were reeducated and exposed to “real news” more regularly, if we all could be “objective” about “the facts,” we’d all come to right and proper conclusions and be united toward the right goals.
This view avoids problems the decline of public trust in big institutions like media and the social polarization and radicalization that increasingly characterize contemporary American politics. It also avoids the basic problems of politics and realities of the American experience. Regulation of tech companies and better curation algorithms for news sites are probably good things in themselves, but we’d be kidding ourselves to believe that’ll change hearts and minds.

With news of an indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea from former Trump foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI, it seems like the horror story of the 2016 presidential election just won’t stop.
In response to resurfaced allegations of the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia in meddling with the presidential election, right-wing media has come up with an answer: There was collusion with Russia, but it came from the Democrats. Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson said on Tucker Carlson Tonight:
 “Knowing what you know about Russia, was it really a good idea for the Obama administration and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to approve a deal giving the Russians control of 20 percent of our uranium supply?” 
“Why did Hillary’s office and the Obama administration sign off on giving the Russians a fifth of our uranium?”
“Why is that a good idea to give a hostile power 20 percent of our uranium supplies? It’s insane though.”
“How would Hillary Clinton not know if a Russian company was getting 20 percent of our uranium supply? What was she doing?”
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker rated this claim — that Hillary Clinton gave 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply to Russia — four Pinocchios, its highest marker of falsehood. The paper called it “simply absurd.”
Yet, predictably, this story has resulted in calls from members of the Republican base to “lock her up.” It is a counterpunch and a purposeful deflection of the progress of special investigator Robert Mueller’s investigation into collusion with Russia. And yet, despite its falsity, the story is continuing to gain traction among right-wing media; Fox & Friends, Breitbart, Sean Hannity and the Daily Caller have all run stories either encouraging the theory or stating the facts outright. None of these outlets have corrected or retracted their stories for containing plainly false claims.
That is gravely worrisome. It is amazing that constant lying has become the new normal. 
What’s even more amazing is how pervasive it has become. Whereas plainly obvious fake stories used to be peddled by Alex Jones’ InfoWars, unscrupulous forums on Reddit and elsewhere in the depths of the Internet, they have now become insidiously mainstream. The entertainment of conspiracy theories by folks like Carlson, who Forbes recently called the “king of cable news,” is gravely damaging, and will have long-term effects on the state of our democracy.

In his counterpart to this column, my colleague Luke Phillips says that this isn’t fake news; instead, he calls it “mass media opinion journalism.” Unfortunately, critics underestimate the degree to which these news sites have peddled stories filled with facts that are unequivocally false. Take just the past few weeks at Breitbart: the news site published stories falsely saying that immigrants were arrested for starting the California wildfires, that Planned Parenthood worked “in tandem” with the Satanic Temple and that a study determined that refugees in San Diego had an active tuberculosis incidence rate more than 100 percent higher than the national average. 
This news is completely fake. And yet, the disconnect between legitimate journalism and media that relies on made-up facts has created alternate realities, and lent support to President Donald Trump’s view that it’s the legitimate journalism that is fake — not the media sources that peddle conspiracy theories. That’s why, even though fake news is not a partisan issue — there is right-wing fake news (Breitbart) and left-wing fake news (Natural News) — it is disproportionately affecting the right. Right-wing fake news sites have seized on the changing tide of the right to further narratives that are consistent with their beliefs about the world, and so they have become all the more pervasive.
In light of this changing media landscape, we must be vigilant now more than ever and not only in the news that we consume. We also must challenge those around us, and continue to fight for the legitimacy of journalism. One way that comes about is through the marketplaces that have come to rule the way we communicate and disseminate information today — social media conglomerates. Congress is challenging Facebook, Twitter and Google for their curation techniques regarding fake news stories planted by Russians during the 2016 presidential election, but the issue is much larger than that. We must recommit ourselves to objectivity and truth.
 Phillips alludes to an important point in his side of the column; he thinks that even if we could regulate tech companies or eliminate fake news, “we’d be kidding ourselves to believe that’ll change hearts and minds.” And he’s right. As falsehoods in media have become uniquely pervasive, so has political polarization. So yes, the wounds of our country are too great to be healed by forcing Facebook to disclose the advertisers of false news stories on its site. 
But consider the opposite. If we continue like this, if we continue without challenging the spread of these stories, we succumb dangerously to propaganda. That is the kind of monopoly over information that authoritarianism entails. So we must fight against this phenomenon and continue to work alongside journalists to support them, in word and in dollar. We need to pay for journalism that plays the vital public service to keep us well-informed. We need to restore trust in journalism, as an institution.

EDITOR’S NOTE: The headline on this post has been updated for clarity.
George Papa… was not a foreign policy advisor to Trump.  He was essentially an entry level volunteer.  Don’t make hm out to be anyone significant.  Regarding “fake news”, if your see intent is to win over readers/listeners, to persuade them to join the ranks of your ideology, then your communication content will be either false or tainted, which ever works.

Thirty-five doctoral students from the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work met with administrators Monday to discuss how the school can move forward following a recent sexual harassment lawsuit against a professor at the school. 
The students met with Vice Provost Martin Levine and Marilyn Flynn, the dean of the school, to present a statement with requests for Flynn to address in relation to the recent sexual harassment claims against a social work professor.
“We are pleased that Dean Flynn has agreed to partner with us in achieving our goal of confronting the unspoken grand challenge of ending sexual misconduct and abuse of power at our University and providing an example of institutional leadership on this issue,” the group of students said in a letter addressed to the Dworak-Peck community.
The letter said that they have partnered with Flynn to “confront the unspoken grand challenge of ending sexual misconduct and abuse of power” at USC.
It also said that Flynn agreed to directly acknowledge the harassment that Karissa Fenwick, a student who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit last week against Professor Erick Guerrero and the University, said she experienced. It stated Flynn pledged to create a committee to review the policies at the University and specifically at the School of Social Work.
The group said that the group will continue to work to advocate to administrators that they need to reconsider the sanctions against Guerrero and “develop policy recommendations to improve transparency, institutional culture, and reporting and enforcement mechanisms.”
 Provost Michael Quick also sent a memo to the USC community on Sunday night, calling for similar steps to be taken by students and staff members alike to create a culture of respect and zero tolerance against abuses of power, though Guerrero and Fenwick were not named.
“We ask that each one of us take time over the next several days to reflect on our own past experiences and choices, and examine what roles each of us can play going forward that will make USC, and our larger society, fair, equitable, and free from harassment,” Quick wrote.
The memo also addressed, in general terms, the abuse of power and recent sexual harassment cases at USC. 
“If we do not have equity, and inclusion, and opportunity — for everyone — then not only are we harming people, we are not maximizing our potential as a university,” Quick wrote. “That is a waste of our intellectual talent, and it limits our future at a time when we can ill afford it.”
Quick also called for the deans of the different to hold forums for students to speak about “creating a culture of respect.” He said deans will report back to him with steps in improving the general culture at the school.

Karissa Fenwick (left) sued professor Erick Guerrero (right) alleging that he sexually harassed her in January.
Fallout from the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a graduate student against a professor and the University continued to play out Monday with allegations on both sides regarding mishandling by the USC Office of Equity and Diversity.
The attorney of Erick Guerrero, the professor involved in the sexual harassment lawsuit, sent a letter to the Daily Trojan accusing the office of committing “egregious violations” in its initial five-month investigation, which began when Fenwick reported the harassment on Jan. 19. 
“It’s a very arbitrary and unfair system where it doesn’t depend upon the evidence and actual facts,” said Mark Hathaway, Guerrero’s attorney, in an interview Monday with the Daily Trojan. “It’s very important that it’s thoughtful dialogue, and that these issues are determined in a fair and transparent way.”
Guerrero filed an appeal on May 11 after the initial investigation ruled in favor of Fenwick, causing the office to reopen the case, according to Fenwick. 
After examining Guerrero’s appeal, the OED upheld the decision in Fenwick’s favor. Hathaway said in the letter that Guerrero filed a grievance to the Academic Senate on the grounds of his Title IX investigation, claiming the University withheld evidence from him.
Hathaway said this violated the policy in the Title IX bylaws, which state that the investigators must “provide the complainant, the respondent and appropriate officials timely and equal access to information” used in any meetings or hearings in the investigative process.
“Faculty disciplinary matters should not be guided by expediency and the momentary outrage of the majority, but rather by the well-established rules, practices, and policies that are set forth in the Faculty Handbook,” Hathaway said in the letter to the Daily Trojan.
Fenwick and her attorney, John Winer, also expressed concerns regarding the length of the investigation in an interview with the Daily Trojan Monday. Winer said  the OED’s five-month investigation was not prompt, in accordance with California state law.
Although Fenwick was satisfied with the investigation’s findings and the assistance from the OED investigators, she believed the reopening of the case after Guerrero’s appeal, which had new evidence and witnesses, was unnecessary. 
“[Guerrero] had been given multiple chances throughout the original first investigation to provide any evidence and witnesses,” Fenwick said. “This was not an appeal. It was treated like it was like a whole new investigation. It felt like an investigation of me — not of what happened.”
Fenwick added that while she agreed with the findings of the case, she did not agree with the resulting consequences. Fenwick, however, did not file a grievance with USC and filed a lawsuit with Winer.
Gretchen Means, OED’s director, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

What started off as a series of late-night cross-disciplinary talks between seniors Sophie Wix and Lindsey Beach became a week-long symposium for student entrepreneurs and industry leaders — and now, USC’s first-ever Innovation Week is taking place this week.
The four-day event, which started Monday, will showcase student projects and business ventures that address pressing themes, from health to sustainability.
“It’s not about the ‘what’ or the ‘how’ as much as the ‘why,’” said Wix, the president and co-founder of Innovation Week. “The ‘why’ drives you at the end of the day. You have to be willing to make sacrifices. Use this time to really understand what your passion is and dig deep into that, because when times get tough, what you really care about is going to pull you through.”
Over the summer, Wix, who is studying health and human sciences, and Beach, who is studying business administration, worked with co-founders Luke McGartland, a senior majoring in arts, technology, and the business of innovation, and Kabir Sagoo, a USC alumnus who studied neuroscience, entrepreneurship and international relations, to make Innovation Week a reality. 
“It’s all about handing it back to the students and saying here’s a space for you to network and to share ideas and to really organically connect across disciplines,” Wix said.
Each day addresses a grand challenge with student, faculty and alumni panelists. Human health, e-currency technology and sustainability were selected as the year’s most pressing concerns. The event has been featured on the website for InnovateLA, a two-week gathering in November for innovators and entrepreneurs.
On Monday, the first night of Innovation Week, the focus was on human health. At a panel discussion in Fertitta Hall, Marshall alumnus and Health-Ade Kombucha co-founder Vanessa Dew described her commitment to the process of crafting authentic kombucha. 
She said she founded her business to emphasize quality and customer satisfaction, using fresh, organic, local ingredients. Since selling its first bottles in 2012, Health-Ade Kombucha has expanded sales to all 50 states and opened a brewery in Torrance, Calif. 
Human Health Night also featured Sara Ma, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and a researcher and designer for CancerBase. CancerBase was founded by scientists Jan Liphardt at Stanford and Peter Kuhn at USC, according to its website.
The platform allows cancer patients to contribute to an online database to improve cancer research. Patients can also connect with each other through CancerBase, pursue different treatment options and learn how to improve their quality of life. 
Ma spoke on the importance of giving personal help to those living with cancer. By enhancing the conversations patients can have with their doctors and caretakers, CancerBase helps patients manage their lives and treatment, she said. 
Ma developed the brand and logo for CancerBase and contributed to former Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Summit in 2016.
“We love the process of innovation,” Ma said. “If you love the process and the people [who] you’re working with, the process of solving problems, you’ll be able to stay in the game and focus your attention on solving a problem.”
Ethan Bresnick, a freshman majoring in media arts and practice, spoke about his work with developing Augmedix, which is powered by Google Glass. In high school, he joined Augmedix as the fifth founding member, serving as the creative director. This health care application helps doctors maximize their time with their patients, quickly pulling up records so that they are able to assist their patients. Augmedix has partnered with Sutter Health and Dignity Health.
On Wednesday, Blockchain Night will promote the new technology that gained popularity with the digital currency Bitcoin. Student innovators and industry leaders will discuss the future of blockchain in entrepreneurship, and USC Marshall professor James Healey will moderate a panel with experts in the innovative technology. 
On Thursday, Sustainability Night will showcase leaders in technology for social change.
Innovation Week will end with a two-hour Impact Night on Friday. Brian Shepard, assistant dean of the Iovine and Young Academy, will lead the discussion with panelists Amanda Daflos, the director of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Innovation Team; Albert Lawrence, correspondent on The Henry Ford’s Innovation Nation and Robbie Cabral, founder of padlock company Benjilock.
Beyond USC, Wix and her co-founders hope to spread Innovation Week to other universities worldwide. The London School of Economics will host its first Innovation Week next semester, and the founders of Innovation Week at USC are in talks with student leaders at some East Coast universities.

The Daily Trojan has received the ACP Newspaper Pacemaker Award, one of the top honors for college journalism, for the first time since 1991. 
The Associated Collegiate Press presented the award to Daily Trojan staff members at its annual conference in Dallas on Oct. 28. Out of 43 finalists, the Daily Trojan was one of 23 newspapers to receive the prestigious award.
“The Pacemaker is the association’s preeminent award and is often called the Pulitzer Prize of collegiate journalism,” said Laura Widmer, ACP executive director. “ACP is honored to recognize the best of the best.”
According to the website, entries are judged based on several categories: “coverage and content, quality of writing and reporting, leadership, design, photography and graphics.” This year’s award was granted for issues the paper published during the 2016-17 academic year, including special issues on binge drinking, diversity on campus and sexual assault. 
Several Daily Trojan staff members also took home individual awards. Sports editor Julia Poe won fourth place for Sports Story of the Year, while staff illustrator Devon Manney won third place in Illustration, under the Design of the Year category. 
Staff photographer Anvay Ullal received an honorable mention for Spot News Photo of the Year in the Photo Excellence category, while Fall 2016 editor-in-chief Matt Lemas received an honorable mention for Four-Year College Reporter in the Reporter of the Year category. The Daily Trojan staff also received an honorable mention for Multimedia Sports Story of the Year. 
“The Pacemakers are the gold standard of college journalism and receiving this honor really validates the long hours, and hard work the staff has put in,” said Emma Peplow, Daily Trojan’s current editor-in-chief. “Our campus has been the subject of many difficult conversations this past year and I’m so proud of the way we told these stories.”
Other news organizations that received the Newspaper Pacemaker this year included The Daily Tar Heel from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, The Daily Pennsylvanian from the University of Pennsylvania and Daily Wildcat from the University of Arizona. 
The Daily Trojan was one of only three publications running five days a week to receive the Newspaper Pacemaker this year. 
The Daily Trojan was last nominated for a newspaper Pacemaker in 1994, and last won the award in 1991. The paper last received the Online Pacemaker, a separate category that only evaluates the organization’s online content, in 2016.

What’s spookier than combining ghost stories and Los Angeles public transit? Every Sunday night in October, Ghost Hunters of Urban Los Angeles, or “GHOULA,” put on an entertainingly educational Haunted Red Line Tour where participants explored the city’s history with an eerie twist.
“We are a social club dedicated to the preservation of greater L.A.’s rich haunted history, and the promotion and celebration of this local lore through ghostly gatherings, events, and publications,” GHOULA writes on its website.
Throughout the year, GHOULA, which was founded in 2006, promotes a variety of spooktacular happenings in the city, including haunted venues, cat ghost stories and personal accounts of paranormal activity. But there’s no better time to see the spooky side of the city at large than in October while traveling underground. Those who dared to adventure along the “blood” Red Line began their journey at the palm tree-lined island in front of Union Station and then traveled through 13 stations, getting off and on along the way while hearing tales about a spirit soldier, a vanishing padre, a ghostly car and more.
Connor Bright, a well-traveled paranormal historian, led the tours.
“She calls Los Angeles her home and the spirits of the city her friends,” her online description states.
Bright is the co-founder of “What’s YOUR Ghost Story,” an online community that describes itself as a platform for people to share paranormal experiences and seek answers from experts. Additionally, she worked with Los Angeles Hauntings Ghost Tours, where she met Richard Carradine, the president of GHOULA, and collaborated with him on the Haunted Houdini Tour of Los Angeles.
“I am having a blast hosting the Red Line tour. It is easily one of my favorite tours,” Bright said. “I love that it is a grand circle tour of L.A. You get to see a little bit of everything, from the founding of the city to the Golden Age of Hollywood to even more modern scandals.”
Bright traveled a unique path to her paranormal profession. 
“I love history. I wanted to go to school to be a historian or archeologist, but while I was in school, I had someone come and lecture about paranormal history and just fell in love,” Bright said. “I started researching and lecturing and giving tours. Next thing you know, I’m an expert. I stay with it because it’s a passion. The paranormal brings history back to life, and I adore that idea.”

Starting from the entrance of Union Station, palm trees silhouetted against a vivid pink sky, for the last tour on Oct. 29, Bright kicked off the tour by detailing the haunted history of the station before leading tour-goers to depart for the first stop, Pershing Square. Despite a small hiccup as everyone arrived on two separate trains, Bright swiftly brought the group back together and turned Pershing Square, famous for its history of hippies and protests, into an ominous ghost scene. The nearby historic Biltmore Hotel can never be viewed the same when Bright tells the true story of Elizabeth Short, best known as  “The Black Dahlia,” who, in 1947, was found brutally sliced in half outside of the hotel. Some ghost hunters claim that Short still haunts the area, as illustrated by Bright’s vivid anecdote about encountering Short’s spirit with a ghost hunting tool called an “ovilus.”
Tourists then hopped back on the Red Line and got off at the City of Stars, Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. As it turns out, this iconic cross section is famous for more than what meets the eye, and some claim to have seen the ghost of Lon Chaney return to where a bench he frequented to scope out new actors used to be. 
Bright then told a story at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, a venue Marilyn Monroe stayed at often. Monroe allegedly spent a good deal of time rehearsing in front of a specific floor-length mirror in her room, and, following her death, was said to have haunted that same mirror.
The last stop on the tour was the North Hollywood station, where Bright made her final remarks, met with applause, before opening up the floor to questions and inquiries about her personal ghost stories.

Bright was an excellent, energetic ghostly tour guide who is clearly passionate about her craft, and anyone who is able to take part in any of her events with GHOULA will, as her last name implies, have an enlightening experience. The free, family-friendly tour offered a unique way to explore and learn about Los Angeles, and everyone has something to gain, whether long-time natives or new residents of the area. 
In the end, L.A. public transit has nothing on the untold hauntings that exist throughout the city.

In Los Angeles, the golden age of Hollywood brought young starlets, glamour, drama — and ghosts. This Halloween, check out Hollywood, Griffith Park and a one-of-a-kind theatre for some spook-tacular sightings.
1. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
Marilyn Monroe is said to haunt this historic hotel where she lived for two years and had her first professional modeling shoot at the rooftop pool. Guests have frequently seen her reflection in the mirror that used to be in her old suite. The mirror has sometimes been displayed in the lower elevator foyer, but has since been removed. Montgomery Clift, a troubled Hollywood star, can also be heard practicing trumpet in suite 928, where he lived for three months while filming From Here to Eternity. 
2. The Silent Movie Theatre 
The original owner of the Silent Movie Theatre, John Hampton, died of cancer due to exposure to chemicals used to preserve film. When the theatre reopened in the ’90s, Lawrence Austin, the new owner, found himself in the middle of a murder plot by his projectionist, James Van Sickle. Nineteen-year-old Christian Rodriguez was hired to kill Austin under the guise of a robbery. A teenage concessions worker was shot in the attempt to fake a robbery; she survived and served as a witness in Rodriguez’s trial. Hampton’s ghost can be found in the upstairs lounge while Austin roams the lobby of the theatre. The Silent Movie Theatre, now owned by Cinefamily, is currently closed due to allegations of improper behavior by two Cinefamily executives.
3. Griffith Park
An angry niece, a curse and an unfortunate owner make Griffith Park a must-see place for hauntings. Seventeen-year-old Dona Petronilla placed a curse on the land and its owners after learning that her uncle had not given the property to her after his death. A man involved in the negotiation of the land, C.V. Howard, was shot dead in a nearby saloon. Another owner was killed on a trip to Mexico. And Colonel Griffith J. Griffith was the most unlucky. Wildfires destroyed sustenance for farming and killed most of the livestock. In 1891, Griffith was shot by a business rival. Though he survived, he began giving the land away for free. The curse culminated when Griffith shot his wife in a Santa Monica hotel. He served two years in San Quentin State Prison for his crime. On stormy nights, the ghost of Petronilla can be seen in the Paco Feliz Adobe, the oldest remaining structure in Griffith Park. Griffith’s ghost is most often spotted on horseback guarding his land. 
4. The Hollywood Sign
On the perimeter of Griffith Park sits the famous Hollywood sign. At age 24, the promising young actress Peg Entwistle committed suicide by climbing up a workman’s ladder to the 44-foot high ‘H’ and then jumping to her death. A shoe, jacket, and purse belonging to Entwistle were found by a female hiker two days after the actress had last been seen. Inside the purse was a suicide note stating simply “I am afraid, I am a coward. I am sorry for everything. If I had done this a long time ago, it would have saved a lot of pain. P.E.” Some hikers have seen a woman in period clothes walking up the path to the sign and around Entwistle’s former residence on Beachwood Canyon Drive. The scent of her gardenia perfume lingers around her favorite haunts.
