After eight straight years of losing to rival UCLA, USC’s football team finally won the annual crosstown contest in 1999. Sam Gammell, then a junior, was swept up in the crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and rushed the field in celebration.
“[It] was a massive, incredible kind of thing,” she said. “That was the first time we had gotten the Victory Bell back [during my time at USC].”
As a member of the USC Helenes, a community service organization, Gammell remembers painting a streak of red on the frame of the brass bell awarded to the winner of the annual rivalry game.
These are the stories — the memories — that have come to define the rivalry. In a year marked by the coronavirus pandemic, though, there won’t be any of those. USC and UCLA will play the game. But the rivalry game tradition is so much more than the on-field play — it’s a citywide spectacle.
Players prepare extra hard to earn the bragging rights that come with a win. The stadiums fill with alumni and fans from around the city, Southern California and the country. 
And for years, students have devised numerous traditions and pranks for the week leading up to the big game.
Gammell and Steve Short, who graduated from USC in 1991, recall attending the annual Conquest concert and walking down Trousdale Parkway past the Trojan Knights guarding the Tommy Trojan statue — traditions that still exist today. Gammell said her peers were disappointed that the annual bonfire didn’t happen during her time at USC.
“They’d light this huge bonfire that would probably go 10, 15, 20 feet in the air, and then they’d have the Bruin stuffed animals and things like that that they would burn in the bonfire,” Short said. “Looking back on it, it’s probably a little inappropriate, but it was just to get people obviously fired up before the big game.”
Short said he heard of past rivalry festivities from his father Garry, who attended USC from 1955 to 1959. The Friday before the football game in 1958, Garry, his fellow Daily Trojan editor Joe Jares and Undergraduate Student Government senator-at-large Larry Lichty authored a fake Daily Bruin newspaper filled with USC praise. Various USC student groups paid for 8,000 copies of the fake paper to be printed, and 25 other students helped coordinate their distribution in Westwood.
That was only one of several pranks that were passed down as stories in the Short family. That same year, UCLA students rented a helicopter, planning to dump 500 pounds of manure on Tommy Trojan. But, Steve explained, laughing, the plan backfired, and the manure was drawn back into the helicopter.
After exchanging pranks and a good deal of trash talk in the week leading up to the game, the energy in the stadium is typically just as lively, with packed stands and back-and-forth chanting.
“I don’t know if there’s any [chant that’s] fit for publishing,” Gammell said, chuckling.
Former All-American defensive lineman Shaun Cody, who played for USC from 2001 to 2004, loved rushing out of the Coliseum tunnel to a roaring crowd, especially before those rivalry games.
“It was definitely a sight to be seen when you’re standing on the field you look out at the stands and the Coliseum’s packed to the brim with cardinal and gold and that blue across the way,” Cody said. “You definitely know you’re in the game, and you’re excited to experience that moment.”
But some Southern California natives aren’t always dressed in the same color on game day — many come from families with divided allegiances.
Professor Jeff Fellenzer, who teaches the “Sports, Business, Media” class at USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has only missed one rivalry game since 1964. His mother was a Bruin and he had family friends who were USC fans, so he was at the Coliseum every weekend when USC and UCLA shared the stadium.
“It’s almost like every year [was] a family reunion,” Fellenzer said of the rivalry game. “You’d have all the banter back and forth before the game, after the game, the buildup leading up to it.”
He remembers moments that “seem[ed] larger than life” to him as a kid, including UCLA’s late two-score comeback in 1965 to prevent USC’s Heisman Trophy-winning running back Mike Garrett from making the Rose Bowl as a senior. He was there for running back O.J. Simpson’s famous 64-yard run that solidified a 1967 Rose Bowl berth for the Trojans.
The only game he missed? 2006, when UCLA was the clear underdog but won 13-9 to end USC’s national championship hopes.
“I kept looking, going ‘How could you not be there?’” he said. “It had been so many years.”
Now, the Los Angeles area has 11 major professional sports teams that vie for the attention of the city’s fans. The Rams and Chargers occupy a new $5 billion stadium. The Dodgers won the 2020 World Series. The Lakers and Clippers finished atop the NBA’s Western Conference this season, and the Lakers ended up NBA champs.
Given those choices, Fellenzer says future rivalry games are likely to draw a sellout crowd only if the stakes are high — a Rose Bowl or a College Football Playoff berth, for instance.
“You’re going to have the diehards and the students of course, that college game is going to be [their] top priority, but [for] the sports fans that would go to those games other years when I was growing up … you’ve got real serious competition,” he said. “In a city that’s about winning and star power, it takes teams that are really good to get people to drop what they’re doing and go out.”
But no matter the teams’ records, there’s a heightened energy in practice before facing UCLA, Cody said. Bragging rights are always on the line. As a Southern California recruit, Cody had played against several players on the opposing team prior to college, and there was always the risk of running into the UCLA guys around the city.
“You know throughout the year you’re going to see [the other team’s players]; whether it’s working out somewhere [or] you run into them at a restaurant, they’re going to be around,” Cody said. “When you had those bragging rights on your side, it was definitely better walking somewhere that was UCLA territory or a UCLA restaurant after winning the game, and they couldn’t tell you anything … You ran the place.”
Although the football game is the most-viewed spectacle between the two schools each year, Fellenzer noted that the rivalry is so special because the competitiveness extends to every sport.
“It’s what college sports are all about,” he said. “It’s the color, it’s the drama. So many games have meant so much over the years in every sport … It’s a list that’s really unmatched, I think, in any college rivalry, when you talk about the caliber of world-class athletes across all sports.”

USC will take on UCLA Saturday at the Rose Bowl for the 90th all-time matchup between the crosstown rivals.
The Trojans are coming off a decisive 38-13 victory over Washington State that upped their CFP ranking to No. 15 and continued their undefeated season. A victory for the Trojans would give them a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game.
“[This is an] important game for our season and everything we want to accomplish, but a really special game, to be honest with you, for both teams and our city,” said Clay Helton, who has only lost once to UCLA as USC’s head coach, in a virtual press conference Tuesday. “This is one of the best rivalries in college football.” 
Assuming coronavirus testing goes well, all players who missed the WSU game amid USC’s coronavirus outbreak will be available Saturday, according to Helton. Sophomore inside linebacker Ralen Goforth will also likely return this week after suffering a foot injury against Utah in Week 3.
Helton praised UCLA head coach Chip Kelly Thursday, especially for UCLA’s run game this year, something the Trojans will have to contain. 
“Chip’s obviously a brilliant offensive mind, he always has been,” Helton said. “He’s really one of the better run game coaches there are in college football … He really tries to stay ahead of the sticks, not having negative yardage plays.”
The Bruins have the second-most rushing yards per game in the Pac-12 this season with 227.6. Senior running backs Demetric Felton and Brittain Brown are main contributors, alongside junior quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson. 
Felton leads UCLA in rushing, gliding for over 100 yards in three of UCLA’s five games this year. He is also the team’s third-leading receiver. 
Brown has been a consistent part of the offense as well, coming in second in rushing and fourth in receiving. 
Thompson-Robinson is the key for the Bruins. He has 901 total yards in three games this year. Against Colorado in Week 1, he threw for 303 yards and four touchdowns, while also running for 109 yards and one touchdown. 
Helton had high praise for the junior. 
“He’s probably the best creator in our league,” Helton said. “When bad plays happen, he finds a way to make them great.”
Sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis and the USC offense exploded against Washington State last Sunday. Slovis threw for five touchdowns and 287 yards.
However, the Trojans lacked consistency on the offensive side in the second half. They only had 66 total yards of offense and 3 points, after 221 total yards and 35 points in the first half. 
“You know, when you get up early, sometimes it’s hard to keep the energy up and I think that’s probably what happened,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said Tuesday. 
The inconsistency could pose problems against a solid UCLA front.
Even though the Trojans ran for five total yards last week, the run game was far from a concern for Harrell, who cited Slovis’ performance and Washington State playing man-to-man coverage for the underwhelming rushing total.
“I think when the quarterback goes 17-of-17 to end the half and throws five touchdowns, you’re doing some things well,” Harrell said. “So that’s our level of concern.”
Being unable to stay focused throughout the game, however, could be problematic for USC, especially since UCLA’s offense can score quickly. 
Helton emphasized the need to be locked in the entire game.
“This is a really important game to be able to play [the] full 60 minutes, keep your foot on the gas pedal,” Helton said. “I thought we did that defensively the entire night [against Washington State] especially with our energy and we got to be able to do that consistently offensively.”
The Trojans will face a Bruin defense allowing the eighth-fewest passing yards per game with 229.4, aided in large part by outstanding junior defensive back Stephan Blaylock and redshirt junior linebacker Caleb Johnson as well as redshirt senior defensive lineman Osa Odighizuwa. 
Similar to the Bruins offense, USC has been hot on the defensive side of the ball. The Trojans have allowed the fifth-fewest rushing yards, third-fewest total yards and fewest points per game in the conference this season. 
The defensive line for USC has emerged into a suffocating presence on opposing offensive linemen. One main contributor — redshirt junior Nick Figueroa, who leads the Trojans in sacks with 3.5 and tallied three last week alone — will play a key role in stopping this run-heavy UCLA offense.
“It’s no surprise to me that he’s thriving in this package,” defensive coordinator Todd Orlando said Wednesday. “He’s got talent and a lot of people have talent, but it’s the internal talent that to me measures a person [and] how much success they’re going to have. And he has that in bunches.”
Figueroa, a transfer from junior college whose final decision came down to USC and UCLA, said that the relationship between the defensive linemen has been a main catalyst for the group’s strong play. 
“Our D-line’s a really tight-knit group, so we just always want to see each other be successful,” Figueroa said Wednesday. “And when that success happens, it starts to be a little bit contagious.” 
It’ll be up to Orlando to scheme up a defense to stop the highly-potent UCLA ground game. 
Kickoff is 4:30 p.m. Saturday.

Positive symptomatic and asymptomatic coronavirus cases among students and employees have continued to rise in the weeks following Thanksgiving, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. According to Van Orman, these trends demonstrate “very serious” circumstances both on campus and in Los Angeles County that USC Student Health aims to address with vaccine distribution in the upcoming months. 
According to the University’s COVID-19 in Numbers dashboard, during the week of Nov. 29 to Dec. 5, 43 students and 26 employees tested positive for the coronavirus. This marks a stark increase from the previous week, during which 24 students and six employees tested positive. However, according to Van Orman, positive student case numbers are not rising as fast because more students have left the L.A. area for winter break.
“Despite the warnings, we saw lots and lots of people travel and/or gather for Thanksgiving, and many of the cases that we’re seeing right here on campus among students and employees … when we asked them, they tell us they got together with groups for Thanksgiving,” Van Orman  said. “So we believe it is directly related to gatherings that may have happened over the Thanksgiving holidays, unfortunately.”
While the positivity rate via external testing distributor Color’s asymptomatic surveillance testing declined to 0.9%, Van Orman said there has been almost a 20-fold increase in the University’s asymptomatic positivity rates in the last six weeks. Meanwhile, symptomatic positivity rates increased to 3.0% last week, according to the dashboard.
“I know [the 0.9% asymptomatic positivity rate] seems very low, but those are among individuals who haven’t been symptomatic, haven’t been exposed,” Van Orman said. “Just for reference, in October, our asymptomatic positivity was about 0.5% … That’s actually very concerning for the level of disease that we’re seeing.”
KTLA reported that L.A. County has continued to see an alarming increase in coronavirus cases following Thanksgiving, with 12,819 new cases recorded Thursday. According to the L.A. Department of Public Health, this update brings the total number of positive cases to a staggering 487,917 cases countywide.
According to the Los Angeles Times, L.A. County will likely receive its first allocation of the coronavirus vaccine of 84,000 doses, with these doses prioritized to healthcare workers. While Student Health has yet to be informed of when doses will arrive on campus, it is currently finalizing its list of priority groups for vaccine distribution. Van Orman said the first doses will be prioritized for healthcare workers and other essential employees.  
According to Van Orman, there are roughly four groups for the University’s incoming vaccine distribution. While the first group includes healthcare workers and essential employees, the second group includes those who work in education settings and/or are at higher risk, Van Orman said. Most students will fall under the third group, and then the fourth group involves everyone else, she said. 
“Students really for the most part fall in what we think of as group [or] phase three,” Van Orman said. “Some students might be in phase two, if they’re at higher risk … for example, students who might have significant underlying health conditions or [those who] are over 65. And then our health professions students, so our dental students or medical students who are in the healthcare settings, would potentially fall into the phase one.”
According to The New York Times, British medical regulators warned Wednesday that people with a significant history of allergic reactions should not receive the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine — one of the coronavirus vaccines that have demonstrated efficacy and have been distributed to the United Kingdom since — while they investigate two health workers who received the vaccine and had developed anaphylactoid reactions. 
Van Orman said while she is excited that there are many positive news surrounding the coronavirus vaccine, she said it is also important to understand the limitations of them. Even though data demonstrated remarkable efficacy in vaccines like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, implying that participants are not contracting COVID-19 as a result, Van Orman said there is still more to be known. 
“Some side effects may not emerge until you’re now vaccinating a million people or two million people,” Van Orman said. “So one thing about the vaccines is we just have to understand that the safety data, while it looks very good for the Pfizer vaccine, we won’t know all the safety data until it’s widely used, so that’s just the reality.”
Van Orman said she and other healthcare workers, as well as the Food and Drug Administration — whose advisory council recommended emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine Thursday — are watching worldwide vaccine distribution very closely to see what other potential safety warnings to integrate into vaccination programs. 
Another gap in information regarding vaccines is whether the vaccine will successfully prevent transmission from someone who tests positive for the coronavirus, Van Orman said. According to Van Orman, such information is “very difficult” to gather especially in the early phases of vaccine distribution; therefore, she said taking the vaccine has to be complementary to wearing masks, adhering to social distancing guidelines and getting tested regularly to prevent further transmission.
Amid the growing anti-vaxxer movement and general skepticism regarding the coronavirus vaccine, Van Orman said she expects for it to be a challenge to get all students and employees willing to get vaccinated. 
“We have to be really open and honest with people about what we know, and what we don’t know,” Van Orman said. “We also really have to have that complex conversation about risk and benefit … It’s also important for people to set models. As soon as it’s available, and my prioritization group comes up, I’m going to be the first in line to get that vaccine because I understand the impact that it’s had on our communities and the need to stop, honestly, to stop the number of people who are dying right now.” 
Even with the spring semester starting online, Van Orman said Student Health has continued to work with private landlords and sent out more messaging urging students to not return to L.A. in the spring due to the current countywide and nationwide surge in coronavirus cases. If students still choose to return to L.A., Van Orman said she strongly encourages them to delay their return till the surge is over, noting that the country has “a very, very difficult few months” ahead.
“Certainly, I know students, that the desire to come back and the need to kind of have a place to study is really real, but unfortunately, living in a household, living locally, it really is not safe right now,” Van Orman said. “And it’s actually prohibited to see anyone out of your household … So I discourage students from doing that.”
