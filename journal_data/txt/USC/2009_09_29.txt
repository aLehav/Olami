Students trying to take courses at community colleges in California are facing challenges after stimulus funds fell short of expectations, forcing another round of budget cuts.
The California State Legislature hoped to receive about $130 million in stimulus funds from the federal government for the state’s 110 community colleges, which was calculated based on the state’s 2008 budget. Instead, the state only received between $35 million and $37 million this fall, according to Vice Chancellor of California Community Colleges Terri Carbaugh. This substantial difference in funds means budget cuts for the community college system.
“We’ve asked all of our college presidents to focus on our priorities,” Carbaugh said. “We’ve told them to take a look at the courses [with] less focus on the mission and ask: Is this really a priority?”
The budget cuts will hit community colleges across the state, and could affect students who want to transfer to four-year schools like USC. Schools will have to decide whether to cut various student services, classes or faculty to make up for the deficits, Carbaugh said.
Glendale Community College has already begun to feel the effects of the cuts. Interim Superintendent/President Dawn Lindsay said the college will have to cut classes, faculty, services and likely its second summer session.
“We’re doing everything we can to keep cuts away from classes,” Lindsay said.
At College of the Canyons, located in Valencia, the cuts ran as deep as $11 million.
“This year, we took another hit,” said Sue Bozman, a College of the Canyons spokeswoman. “We cut back on advertising and we cut back on supplies. Then it got to a point where we needed to make cuts in staff, [and] we needed to cut back on the number of classes we were offering.”
According to Bozman, these cuts have an intense impact on the college’s students.
“We’re right now seeing a tidal wave of people trying to get classes. Many people are on waitlist and not getting the classes they need,” Bozman said.
For prospective students who wish to transfer to USC, classes that are cut or completely filled can turn out to be a significant setback because it makes it difficult for them to get the courses they need to transfer.
Alesia Forté is in her first semester at West Los Angeles College and hopes to transfer to USC in one year. Like other students at community colleges, it was difficult for her to take the required classes.
“I was going to go to El Camino [Community College], but it was impossible to get into the classes I needed,” Forté said.
Forté also said that certain student services were suffering because of the budget cuts.
“For counseling services, the lines are out the door,” Forté said. “There are signs that say administrators and counselors have been out because of the economy.”
Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission at USC, said the budget cuts can cause problems from students trying to take classes that will transfer.
“[It’ll be] more challenging to find courses we want [students] to take,” said Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission at USC. “It might require them to be a little more flexible and to look at several community colleges to see if their courses are offered there. But it’s challenging to predict the exact impact this is going to have.”
But Bozman said the budget cuts wouldn’t affect transfer students much, because they were less likely to cut general education classes than more specialized classes.
For now, community colleges have to brace themselves for an even harder coming year because of the down economy.
“We expect deeper cuts in the 2010/2011 year unless something changes on the other side.  This is a long lasting recession,” Carbaugh said.

The No. 14 USC men’s golf team slogged through another poor final round Monday at the Ping/Golfweek Invitational and finished the tournament in seventh place at 33-over 897.
The Trojans entered the final day of play tied for third but struggled down the stretch. USC shot 16-over 592 for the first two rounds.
“It’s unfortunate that we finished the way we did but we have a young team. We’re playing against strong fields on great, tough golf courses and I don’t think we’re very far off,” coach Chris Zambri said.
No. 3 Oklahoma State, coming off of a second place finish at the Olympia Fields Invitational, blew away the field Monday en route to a commanding victory. The Cowboys shot 2-under 862 for the weekend and swept the top three individual finishes. Sophomore Peter Uihlein took the victory for Oklahoma State, followed by teammates Morgan Hoffmann and Trent Whitekiller.
Zambri said that kind of gap between the victors and the rest of the field is rare, although it can happen with a team as talented as the Cowboys.
“This is my fourth year and we’ve probably had three events where [there] was a margin of victory greater than 20 strokes,” he said. “It’s possible, especially when you get on the tougher courses.  [Oklahoma State] is going to have even more separation when the course gets tough.”
Compounding the frustration for the Trojans was their inability to keep pace with the other Pac-10 schools in the tournament. USC was sandwiched between Washington and Arizona State on the leaderboard entering the final round but faltered late for the second consecutive weekend.
“If we can go out and shoot 1-under in a given round, there’s no reason why we should shoot 18- and 16-over in two other rounds,” Zambri said. “I’m really disappointed that we lost ground to them and three other teams. We go from tied for third to seventh.  It’s unacceptable.”
The Huskies finished second at 20-over 884 while Arizona State finished third at 25-over 889.
Freshman Martin Trainer led the way for USC, tying for 12th place. Playing in only his second collegiate tournament, Trainer shot a 6-over 222 for his second straight top-20 finish.
“For a freshman to come in and play as well as he has on the golf courses that we’ve played on is really impressive,” Zambri said. “It says a lot about his game and we’re really excited about what we have in him.”
Junior Matthew Giles had a tournament — and final round — to forget. The returning All-American plummeted down the leaderboard Monday after bogeying eight of the first 12 holes. He ended the day 10 strokes over par and finished the tournament tied for 36th at 12-over 228.
“He got off to a tough start and maybe let that affect his play after that,” Zambri said.
Freshman T.J. Vogel finished tied for 27th at 9-over 225 and sophomore Steve Lim tied for 32nd at 11-over 227. Freshman Sam Smith, who shot 14-over 230, brought up the rear for the Trojans with a 43rd place finish.
Despite some early season inconsistency, Zambri is confident the team will continue to improve as it gains experience.
“Sometimes perspective [can get] fuzzy, but when it’s all said and done we’re young, we’re going to get better, and we still haven’t played our best,” he said.
USC has two weekends off before it plays at The Prestige tournament in La Quinta, Calif. First-round action will start Oct. 12.

For all of the USC basketball team’s success in recent years, the Galen Center and its crowd is still far from being considered one of college basketball’s best home-court advantages. A group of students, with the help of new Trojan basketball coach Kevin O’Neill and the USC athletic department, is trying to change that this season.
The Trojan Fever Fanatics, a new group founded by USC junior Eric Ronan, have made its mission to improve student attendance at home basketball games and create a unique game atmosphere.
“Coach has been extremely involved,” said Ronan, the co-executive director of the Fanatics and a junior majoring in public relations. “He said he would do anything in his power to promote the group and support it so that we get more people at basketball games and have a better experience.”
The Fanatics held their first informational meeting Tuesday evening, with a special appearance by O’Neill.
O’Neill told the gathered students that he is committed to helping improve the atmosphere at home basketball games.
“If you let me know, I’ll be there to help you,” O’Neill said. “If you need me to go speak at rallies, I can do that. I will really do whatever.”
O’Neill also discussed his expectations for this year’s team and the selling points for USC basketball.
“I think our team is gonna be better than what people expect,” O’Neill said. “Our team is gonna work harder than every team in the county. To me, if you’re watching guys playing hard, that’s fun to watch.”
About 40 students attended the meeting, and most were enthusiastic about the potential of both the group and the team under O’Neill.
“I’m definitely excited because I feel like he’s a very personal coach,” said Madison Ainley, a junior majoring in film production. “He’s hands-on not only with his players but also with the student section, like he wants to be a part of it.”
O’Neill realizes that a large factor in students’ willingness to attend basketball games is the success of the team on the court.
“The more we win, the easier it is for students to get interested,” O’Neill said.
Michael Serna, a sophomore majoring in business administration, put it more bluntly.
“If USC basketball doesn’t win, there’s not gonna be fans that want to go to the game,” Serna said.
One of the more immediate goals for the Fanatics is to have a consistently full student section, especially for conference games.
“Right now, we can definitely improve our attendance and this year. I think if the student section is full for all Pac-10 basketball games, that’s the biggest goal,” said David Kern, the co-executive director of the Fanatics and a sophomore majoring in business administration.
“[Last year] we could have 200 [student] fans for one game and 1,200 for the next,” Associate Athletic Director Craig Kelley added. “Our goal is to get that 1,200 for every game.”
Kelley was already encouraged by the turnout at the meeting.
“We tried this five years ago and the turnout wasn’t anything like this,” Kelley told the students.
The Fanatics will be made up of a group of about 20 members, whose responsibilities include leading chants at the games and coming up with new USC basketball traditions.
“Ultimately, the sky’s the limit,” Kern said. “Growing up around Duke, the Cameron Crazies, if we could ever become something like that, it would be amazing. It’s just gonna come down to the creativity of the group and the people in it.”
Great Job Eric!

Stafon Johnson was the first USC football player I ever talked to.
I approached him as he walked off Howard Jones Field after a Monday practice last season.
He was visibly busy. There were 10 or 20 kids waiting for his autograph — I later learned this is quite normal — and plenty of things to be done.
Guys come up with excuses all the time when reporters ask them for a minute or two to talk — you’d be surprised how many times a player doesn’t hear you from five feet away — but he didn’t. He stopped, turned to me.
I was nervous. He wasn’t. He paused, laughed in a hearty, welcoming way in between autographs and made me feel immediately comfortable.
My mind flew back to that moment when I heard what had happened on Monday.
Johnson, a senior running back, was doing his usual morning workouts in Heritage Hall when he dropped a weight on his throat while bench pressing.
He started coughing up blood and was rushed to California Hospital Medical Center, where he then underwent seven consecutive hours of surgery on his neck and larynx — the latter of which doctors called “destroyed, fractured and displaced.”
He hasn’t been able to talk yet.
Talk about a lack of luck.
Johnson is probably the most talkative guy on the team. Every weekday afternoon, after the three whistles are blown and practice ends, he comes bounding across the field as he prepares to talk to the media.
He’s just a happy person.
He’s always jawing with another running back, always in a benevolent manner, always with an enormous grin across his face.
And that’s truly notable, because Johnson has had so many opportunities to err — so many opportunities to pull an Emmanuel Moody and speak out — and he never has.
He was a first-team All-American his senior year at Dorsey High, and he was supposed to be the marquee back in the ’06 recruiting class.
Then C.J. Gable and Moody came along and Johnson watched from the background as Gable started the season opener and basked in the limelight.
Johnson had three carries as a freshman. Did he complain?
No, he apologized.
Seriously, he apologized for not giving his best effort.  Imagine that.
“I just didn’t give my best in 2006,” Johnson told USC’s official website. “I just knew I was better than that. I just wasn’t being consistent, wasn’t living up to expectations day in and day out. That’s what got me in the predicament I was in.”
He came back the next season — breaking out with an 11-carry, 144-yard performance against Nebraska — and ran for 673 yards, good for second on the team behind Chauncey Washington.
“Stafon’s been a spiritual leader and a leader on the field in all ways for a long time here and a beloved guy,” USC coach Pete Carroll said in his Tuesday press conference. “So this is something that does affect you. We all will feel it for some time.”
USC has seven running backs who have carried the ball this season. Seven.
And although each of them brings different skills to the gridiron, Johnson’s appeal to USC fans and coaches has always struck a different chord.
“He’s a wonderful kid in this program,” Carroll said. “He means something to everybody here, and it affects everyone. We all feel it.”
In what could be Johnson’s final shining moment as a Trojan — for all intents and purposes, he’s out for the rest of the season and would have to apply for a medical redshirt to return — he carried the ball off the right tackle against Ohio State.
Johnson took three steps towards the goal line, saw Buckeye middle linebacker Austin Spitler eyeing him and juked to the right.
From there, it was an open path to the end zone. Johnson started celebrating the second his toe hit the white chalk, completing an unthinkable comeback and giving USC the lead in the final five minutes at Ohio Stadium.
He calmly paused and pointed to the sky — seemingly stopping time for a second of serenity while the rest of the stadium reacted — before he was bear-hugged by his teammates in a genuinely emotional moment.
If that’s the last we see of him in a game situation, it sure was something to remember. Fitting, isn’t it? A truly memorable guy creating a truly memorable moment.
Fight on, Stafon.
Great article…well written too. Our prayers continue for Stafon and his family. What a true fighter he is!
Fight On Stafon!

The non-profit journalism website Spot.Us, which allows community members to choose and fund news stories,  branched out to Los Angeles last week through a partnership with USC’s Annenberg School for Communication.
Spot.Us, which is attempting to implement a new business model for journalism, allows community members to donate money to fund stories that will be written by freelance reporters. The website also lets members of the public give reporters “tips” for ideas that could potentially turn into stories.
Once the stories are complete, outside media outlets can also pick up the stories for publication if they donate an amount equal to 50 percent of what community members donated for the story.
“We need to experiment in different ways of doing and supporting journalism,” said David Cohn, founder of Spot.Us. “It’s an important part of our democracy; you need citizens to make informed decisions and journalism is what helps them stay informed.”
Spot.Us has partnered with Annenberg to take advantage of its connections to the local journalism community. The school will assist in hiring of a project managing editor for Spot.Us Los Angeles and will provide funds to help the site succeed.
“The economic model is broken; we’re at a time of reinvention and I think Spot.Us is a piece of the reinvention,” said Geneva Overholser, director of the Annenberg School of Journalism.
It can become an important contributor to meeting the public information needs and as a new economic model for news — one of many.”
Cohn originally pitched the idea of expanding Spot.Us to Los Angeles to Overholser at a conference in New York last year, and Overholser proposed a partnership with Annenberg.
About three or four months ago, Cohn proposed the expansion of Spot.Us to the Knight Foundation, a journalism organization based in Miami which funds a number of promising journalism projects.
After the proposal, the Knight Foundation gave Annenberg a $250,000 grant to roll out Spot.Us in Los Angeles.
The grant will fund Spot.Us LA for 18 months, after which Overholser said they will have hopefully figured out a way for the branch to support itself, as the original site does.
Cohn said he has high hopes for the partnership with Annenberg.
“The Annenberg School of Journalism is a very well respected institution and also Geneva Overholser is someone I know and trust,” Cohn said.
I think Annenberg can use Spot.Us in a very positive way; they can help be the on-ground hub for Los Angeles investigation.”
Overholser said she believes non-profits will become increasingly important in the media landscape because the economic model is increasingly untenable. Projects like
Spot.Us, she added, could eventually support a new model for journalism.
“This is a way for [everyone] to help shape journalism because they get a voice in deciding what stories are covered,” she said. “That’s big because in the past with commercial journalism, the public didn’t have much a say and now this model can help change it.”
According to Annenberg Digital News Director Marc Cooper, although Spot.Us has been successful in the Bay Area, it is still too early to know if the model will prevail everywhere.
“It’s still unproven in other areas and as it grows in LA we will be able to evaluate whether in the long run it is a reliable model,” Cooper said. “It is too early to have a definitive judgment but it’s worth trying.”
The model also comes with a setback, according to Cooper, especially for certain types of stories that will lose their “element of surprise” by publicly displaying information about the story online.
“The transparent nature of Spot.Us could make certain types of investigative journalism difficult because it gives the target of investigation a heads up that they are being investigated,” Cooper said.
Maybe one solution is that they won’t put up those types of stories and that’s fine.”
Cohn said the expansion to LA will be just one step for Spot.Us, which he hopes to bring to a number of other metropolitan cities in the United States within the next few years.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Friday, September 25 and Monday, September 28.
Crimes against a person
ON SEPT. 28 at 11:19 a.m., a student reported that while she was studying inside Leavey Library a non-USC male attempted to engage her in conversation and proceeded to touch her hair and hug her without her consent.  The student further stated that when she went to the restroom she returned to find that the male had opened her cell phone to obtain her phone number. The student then left the  library and began receiving text messages from the subject. The Department of Public Safety officers advised the student to contact DPS if the  man contacts her again and she was referred to the Center for Women and Men for guidance.
Crimes against
property
on sept. 25 at 6:50 p.m., a suspect used unknown means to gain entry to the backyard of a house on 37th Place and removed an unattended beer keg and tap.
on sept. 26 at 10:29 p.m., a student used a traffic cone to smash the rear passenger window of a faculty member’s window, at Exposition Boulevard and Watt Way.
Miscellaneous incidents
on sept. 25 at 2:11 p.m., a student reported that he was struck in the shin outside Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house by a bottle that was thrown from the direction of another fraternity house.
on sept. 26 at 12:34 a.m., a student was arrested, cited and released by DPS officers after he was observed urinating outside the Sigma Chi fraternity house.
on sept. 27 at 12:59 a.m. DPS officers responded to a report of students throwing water balloons from the balcony of a third floor apartment at Troy Hall. The students refused to answer the door when the officers arrived so they unlocked it and found 15 individuals hiding in a bathroom and a closet. Numerous open and unopened bottles of alcohol were observed in plain view inside the apartment and were confiscated by the officers after it was determined the residents were underage. The officers then advised the students that the matter would be referred to Judicial Affairs for disturbing the peace and cleared the scene.
on sept. 28 at 4:05 p.m., Transportation Services immobilized a student’s vehicle displaying a forged USC parking permit at Parking Structure C. The student contacted the Transportation Services office, agreed to pay all fees and fines and his vehicle was released. The student was advised that the matter would be referred to Judicial Affairs.
on sept. 28 at 11:40 a.m. in Seely Wintersmith Mudd Memorial Hall of Philosophy, a suspect removed a door from its hinges to gain entry to a second floor library and rifled through several desk drawers and file cabinets, but no property was removed.
on Sept. 28 at 6:25 p.m. at 28th and Hoover streets, DPS officers responded to a student who was struck by a vehicle while riding her bicycle. The student complained of pain to her foot and was unable to walk, so an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA Unit #846 responded and examined the student, then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment. LAPD officers were also requested and responded to conduct a traffic investigation.

USC football practice went on as scheduled Tuesday, but it wasn’t the atmosphere the Trojans are used to at Howard Jones Field.
With senior running back Stafon Johnson still in intensive care after shattering his larynx in a tragic weight room accident on Monday, spirits were low.
Trojan family · Kathleen Fletes, a senior majoring in psychology, writes a message on a banner for injured running back Stafon Johnson in front of Tommy Trojan Tuesday. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“Everybody’s a little down,” junior linebacker Michael Morgan said Tuesday. “When one of your guys goes down, we’re down, but we’re gonna play our best for him.”
Morgan was in the weight room when the accident happened. He called it “scary.”
Other teammates reacted with a universal message.
“We just gotta step up and play through him,” running back Curtis McNeal said after practice. “We’re gonna miss him because he was a big part of this team.”
Junior receiver Travon Patterson said the injury hit him particularly hard — he’s Johnson’s cousin.
“It would be emotional for anybody on this team, since we’re all close, we’re all family, but that’s my little cousin,” Patterson said. “The whole family’s praying for him and we’ve got confidence that he’s gonna be alright.”
The underlying message seemed to be that a win Saturday against No. 24 Cal would be the preferred way to honor Johnson.
“It’s a terrible loss because he’s such a great asset to our team,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “I think it’s motivating us a little bit, and we know that he wants us to do well on Saturday, so we’ll be playing for him.”
Patterson said Johnson will expect a victory from the Trojans.
“The best way to react is to go out there and play our ass off,” Patterson said. “We gotta just go out there and act as if he’s still here. I’m sure he’s gonna be watching come Saturday and if he sees us doing our job and going out to win I think he’s gonna be happy. “
USC coach Pete Carroll visited Johnson at California Hospital Medical Center on Tuesday afternoon.
He said the mood was on the upswing in Johnson’s room, especially for his mom, who was working as a nurse at the hospital when she found out about her son’s injury.
“He was in good spirits,” Carroll said. “He lifted me up, the way he was.
“His mom seemed much better today. To see him awake and alert and able to communicate and all that has really uplifted her.”
Carroll said the reaction to the injury was overwhelming.
“We heard from hundreds of people in letters and calls and messages that have come through just giving their support from all over the country,” Carroll said. “It’s been really obvious that a lot of people know about the story and have stepped up to help out in some way.”

Back on the field, the Trojans continue to be nagged by several injuries on their defensive squad.
Redshirt freshman defensive end Nick Perry, the Pac-10 leader in sacks with six, sat out of practice with a bruised knee.
He originally suffered the injury last week, but it healed enough for him to play against the Cougars.
“He got hit on his kneecap so he’s really stiff today,” Carroll said. “His knee’s real stable but it’s a bruise that’s really bothering him even more than when he first did it.”
Perry’s status for the Cal game is unknown.
—
Junior defensive tackle Hebron “Loni” Fangupo visited practice Tuesday for the first time since he broke his left fibula in the Washington State game.
As he was carted off the field, Fangupo made the “Fight On” sign to rousing applause from the Coliseum crowd.
“I just felt like I had to do it,” Fangupo said Tuesday. “It was emotional. It felt great, uplifting. I knew it was something worth fighting for.”
—
Barkley’s bone bruise in his right shoulder continues to progress.
The injury, suffered in the Ohio State game Sept. 12, has admittedly limited him in practice at times, but the 19-year-old insists he’s improving.
“It’s fine. It’s not going to affect me,” Barkley said. “It’s a little pain, but this is football.”
Barkley is set to make just his fourth career start Saturday against Cal.
—
Cal boasts an offense led by Heisman candidate Jahvid Best, who leads the nation in rushing touchdowns with eight.
“Jahvid Best is a fantastic player,” Carroll said. “Their scheme and everything about them is just frontline, championship style.”
The 5-foot-8 McNeal has been emulating the shifty Best in scout team play this week. Morgan said the Trojans have been focusing on more than just Best, though.
“Just like any other week we’re taking it one play at a time,” Morgan said. He’s a great running back and we’ve got a great game plan for him, but they also have other runners and we have other defenders to focus in on him.”

It’s rare to find a pop star who inspires just as much virulent hatred as he does fervent support — but Lebanese-born British singer Mika is just that star.
Maybe it’s his ridiculously outsized personality, indubitably perfect for a man whose closest artistic influences are Freddie Mercury and Elton John (never the most reserved at a party). Maybe it’s his flamboyantly theatrical music, jam-packed with the kind of sprightly anthems and DayGlo colors that hipsters love to hate. Most likely it’s just the whole package: a wildly creative, bisexual artist who seems to have no inhibitions when it comes to his music or stage presence, yet still sold a stunning six million copies of his debut, largely thanks to mainstream pop fans.

Not surprisingly, Mika has done just what many expected him to do on his sophomore effort, again pulling out all the stops in creating a vivacious record fairly bursting with energy, a wagging middle finger to all his detractors and a beckoning to his fans to come indulge in more guilty pleasures.
Chances are if you liked Mika before, you’ll love The Boy Who Knew Too Much. The necessary corollary to that, of course, is if you hated Life in Cartoon Motion, there probably won’t be too much to like here. Unfortunately, it is this split in opinion that makes The Boy Who Knew Too Much only a middling success as an album. Although Mika should be commended for creating yet another record of supercharged, operatic pop music — one practically overflowing with bells, whistles and that flawless falsetto — it’s essentially a more polished version of his debut, resplendent in multipart Queen-esque harmonies and Scissor Sisters’ gender-swapping lyrics. From the children’s choir backing of opener “We Are Golden,” to the Elton John piano and tribal drums on “Blue Eyes,” to the bombastic, overly cheesy production on syrupy ballad “I See You,” it’s the best and worst of everything we’ve come to expect from Mika over the course of twelve songs.
But put aside Mika’s utter lack of creative restraint and habit of whamming his listener in the skull with his lyrically unvarnished messages, and The Boy Who Knew Too Much reveals the heart and soul of a natural-born songsmith. While there’s nothing here as immediately grabbing as “Grace Kelly,” plenty come close. The best of them come in twos: the double punch of “Blame It On The Girls” and “Rain” comes first, the former dashing into a syncopated piano/handclap stomp and the kind of memorable chorus that even haters will find impossible to ignore, while the latter alternates between trippy verses and a synthtastic chorus that highlights Mika’s spiraling falsetto. “Good Gone Girl” and “Touches You,” meanwhile, are two of the most straightforward pop tunes on the record, featuring the requisite amount of piano, glam-rock choruses and massive hooks that just won’t quit. Best of all, these songs keep the grandiosity to a minimum, instead relying on their effortless melodies and coming out the better for it.
It’s a shame that Mika still wastes his time on frivolous exercises like the vapid metaphor of “Toy Boy” and continues to inflate so many good ideas with unnecessary production and hammy performances like “We Are Golden,” but The Boy Who Knew Too Much is nothing if not a pop album that harbors no illusions about itself.
Mika will never be the kind of artist to change his style as tastes evolve, and so it’s heartening to hear songs like the haunting electro of “By the Time” and the lounge-y closer “Pick Up Off The Floor,” where Mika teases listeners with hints of what he might be capable of. But then the full orchestra comes in on “Pick Up Off The Floor,” the army of cloned harmonies build up, that falsetto goes where it wants to and we’re left — for better or worse — with the Mika of today.

This is not your average robot flick.
There are no clinking metallic machines developing intelligence and trying to take over the world. Instead, the machines look exactly like, and are controlled by, humans. Humans are the agents of their own follies, even if the mistakes they make are through a synthetic being. This is reality — virtually.
OK computer · Bruce Willis stars as surrogate robot-turned-FBI Agent Tom Greer in Jonathan Mostow’s  unconventional sci-fi thriller, Surrogates. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Studios
Surrogates is a chilling, prophetic thriller starring Bruce Willis. The film opens with a countdown of events, creeping toward the inevitable new reality the world has shaped for itself: a world where diseases, crime and murder are at an all-time low. This is all made possible through the use of surrogates — robots connected to the neurons of the human to whom it is registered. The virtual reality created in the film through surrogacy is very much The Matrix meets The Sims.
Like The Matrix, the human sees what the surrogate sees, hears what the surrogate hears and feels what the surrogate feels. But there are fail-safes to eliminate the transmission of pain or death, a feature Neo would have appreciated. Another perk of a surrogate is its existence as a physical “unit” that walks, talks and works in the real, physical universe as opposed to a product of the mind.
With The Sims, you can create whichever character you want for yourself. This is a source of much comic relief in the film; for instance, surrogacy allows an obese, elderly man to work the club scene as a lascivious female blonde. However, the majority of models are younger, idealized forms of their human counterpart.
The surrogates are not perfect; they have to be maintained and charged. They are virtually indestructible, however, and even if the unit is obliterated, the user remains unharmed.
The surrogates were originally made for a noble purpose — to enable the blind to see, the deaf to hear and the disabled to walk. But the craze caught on with the able-bodied public, and surrogate life became reckless and carefree. Those who oppose this lifestyle and prefer not to use surrogates are referred to as “meatbags” and live on reservations.
All goes askew when one such meatbag is paid to kill the inventor of surrogates, using the only device that can override the failsafes to murder both the surrogate and its human user simultaneously. Tom Greer (Willis), a surrogate working for the FBI, is charged with finding the murdering meatbag and his weapon before he does any more damage to the population at large.
Surrogates is a bona fide thriller, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as the film moves through a chilling timeline of how surrogacy came to be the norm in this alternate world.
The film’s objective is not to scare you, but to make you think: What would your surrogate look like? Or would you get one at all?
Despite the futuristic plot, director Jonathan Mostow must be commended for not making the film a typical sci-fi affair. Even though robots litter the screen, and nothing is “real,” Surrogates strangely exudes an air of realism and believability is never sacrificed. But it might be less of a testament to Mostow’s filmmaking and more of a reflection of our current society’s resignation that surrogacy is not too far off — an actual belief given the proximity of virtual reality.
Because he has mastered the vigilant crime fighter throughout his career, Willis has been continually condemned to these roles in his more recent films. But all of that changes with  FBI agent Greer, as Willis finally reveals some depth beneath his good-guy, crime-fighting persona.
British actress Rosamund Pike (Pride and Prejudice, Die Another Day) also makes an impressionable turn as Greer’s depressed wife, Maggie. Pike is an extremely versatile actress who can make her characters deep and emotional, or stoic and hardened. In this case, Pike displays both in the same film, underlining the contrast between the real Maggie and the attitude Maggie has adopted through her surrogate.
Surrogates reminds us that Hollywood is still capable of producing films that make you think. This film won’t be up for any Academy Awards, nor would you need to see it more than once or twice. Nevertheless, you will never regret seeing Surrogates, and it will be virtually impossible to forget its message.

Two USC alums are traveling to the ends of the earth hoping to help one recover a piece of his family history along the way.
Bob Byrd Breyer, class of 1970, is the grandson of Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, one of the first explorers to venture to Antarctica. Admiral Byrd wanted to be the first to make it to the South Pole, but his plans went astray when a storm wrecked his plane.
Mr. Freeze · USC alum Bob Byrd Breyer will head to Antarctica next year to try to recover his grandfather’s plane from almost a century ago. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
Almost half a century later, Breyer is going to get his grandfather’s plane back and he’s taking a fellow Trojan with him.
Andrea Donnellan, a 2003 graduate and a seven-time visitor to Antarctica, approached Breyer in 2005 at the 100th birthday of Norman Vaughn, the last surviving crewmember from Byrd’s expedition.
Donnellan and Breyer discussed the trip and the stranded plane. Donnellan told Breyer she knew where the plane was — sitting on top of the ice, despite experts who said it was likely buried. It was at that party that Donnellan and Breyer decided they were going to try to retrieve the plane.
But before they could get their plans off the ground, Donnellan was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease — a chronic, progressive disease that brings symptoms of tremors and rigidity, with no known cure.
The Byrd Aircraft Recovery Expedition, which initially was hoping to just find the plane, has since changed its plans. The two are still heading to Antarctica,  but they’re also hoping to help find a cure for Parkinson’s by raising money.
The team will start its journey with a fundraiser on Oct. 10. Breyer said the expedition budget is $10 million, with $7 million going to the trek itself and $3 million going to Parkinson’s disease research.
Once the fundraising stage is complete, the team plans to take a boat to Antarctica, as close to the location of the plane as possible. The team will then melt the plane out of the ice and ship it back to the United States.
“We know exactly where it is and how to get it,” Breyer said.
Still, the expedition will be very dangerous.
Cornelius Sullivan, a professor of biological sciences who has been to Antarctica 25 times, said he considers the trip risky.
“It’s an unforgiving environment,” Sullivan said. “People die there.”
But with a total of 10 expeditions to Antarctica between them, Byrd and Donnellan are also well aware of what is in store for them.
The expedition is slated for December of 2010.

After snagging its first Pac-10 Championship last season, the USC women’s tennis team again boasts a top-notch roster for this upcoming season.
The team will have six returning players this season, with the addition of two freshmen, Valeria Pulido and Danielle Lao.
Ace · Junior Maria Sanchez returns a volley against an opponent last year. Sanchez is ranked No. 17 in the ITA Preseason Rankings for singles, and ranked No. 47 in doubles alongside freshman partner Valeria Pulido. - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan
“Even though we lost two key players, we gained two very young and talented girls,” sophomore Alison Ramos said. “We have a really strong recruiting class and I’m excited to see the huge impact they’ll have on our success.”
Coach Richard Gallien, who will be entering his 15th season with the Women of Troy, said the team worked out and competed in tournaments throughout the entire summer.
“We had no off-season,” Gallien said.
USC finished 21-3 overall last season after a run to the NCAA Second Round, placing them ninth in the nation. Gallien said he hopes to build on the success again this year, but that it might take some adjustments.
“With these new faces and our returning players, we will need to see how all the pieces fit in order to find the right combinations,” Gallien said.
Just this month, three women on the singles and two doubles teams earned ITA Preseason Rankings. Junior Maria Sanchez holds the highest ranking on the team with the No. 17 spot in singles. Senior Sarah Fansler has been ranked at No. 30 and Ramos has been ranked at No. 53. In the doubles mix, Fansler is paired up with her teammate from last season, junior Lyndsay Kinstler, as the No. 26-ranked doubles team, while Sanchez and Pulido together are ranked at No. 47.
“Preseason ranking doesn’t mean a whole lot — it’s just a number,” Sanchez said. “We still have to go out and compete with the same teams regardless of our ranking.”
USC’s No. 1 doubles team graduated from the roster last year, so the Women of Troy will need to work on filling the slots for their three doubles teams. Ramos describes this as the “one and only obstacle” for the team right now.
“The doubles point is really important in every match since it determines which team carries the momentum,” Ramos added.
Either way, the team — which has one of the longest seasons of any team on campus because of individual tournaments in the fall followed by team tennis in the spring — will kick off its fall competition this weekend. Four of the Trojan players will compete in the Cal Nike Invitational at Berkeley this weekend while the remaining players will begin a two-week long tournament, the 2009-10 Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships.
Newcomer Lao will start her tournament play Saturday in the pre-qualifying round at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. The next rounds will be held at the Riviera Country Club. Fansler and Ramos will begin play on Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 in the qualifying rounds while Sanchez will play on Oct. 8.
Gallien said he was looking forward to the season ahead.
“Tennis is [a] strange sport. It’s not like we have a new defense to put in this year.” Gallien said. “But every season is different, which makes it very exciting. As long as we repeat how much energy we put in last fall, then the energy and enthusiasm will carry over to this upcoming season and we’ll be ready when the season goes.”

USC RB Stafon Johnson, who underwent invasive throat surgery for more than seven hours yesterday, is in stable condition, according to doctors at the California Hospital Medical Center.
Dr. Gudata Hinika, the hospital’s trauma medical director, admitted that, had the patient not been in such strong physical shape, he might well have died.
“Had that been any one of us, meaning me, we would have not survived,” Hinika said, according to ESPN. “His neck was so solid, so muscular … and the discipline that one learns from being athletic also really helped him to calm down and just do what he needed to do. He took instruction very well. All this combination and his physical fitness contributed to his outcome.”

For the second time in six months, buildings near the cinema school have been evacuated after a gas line ruptured near the cinema school construction site.
According to DPS, the gas leak caused by the rupture was first noticed around 10:30 a.m. At least two LAFD trucks responded immediately and cleared the area.
Students are being kept away from the cinema school and surround buildings until the leak has been contained.
Buildings near the cinema school construction site were last evacuated March 31, after construction workers struck a gas line. That leak was contained within a few hours and no permanent damage was caused.
Until the area is cleared, USC trams will stop at the MTA stop at Jefferson and Hoover and will skip all stops on 34th and McClintock.
Update…
As of 3 p.m., authorities had cleared the area and the buildings were reopened.
Work continued, however, as construction crews tried to fill the hole they had dug on the side of McClintock Avenue while trying to fix the gas line. That work could continue into tomorrow.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said the gas leak posed no immediate threat, but the evacuation was ordered as a precaution.
“It’s not…an unusual occurrence in large construction projects,” Carlisle said. “Usually the danger is not that great unless there’s something like an open spark.”
There were no injuries as a result of the leak and no permanent damage.

Beginning in October, a new research center at USC will be conducting research about health policy in hopes of reforming the health debate in the country.
Funded by a $1.2 million donation made by Leonard D. Schaeffer, a health care executive and professor at USC, and his wife, Pamela Schaeffer, the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics will feature work done mainly by USC’s School of Policy, Planning and Development and USC’s School of Pharmacy.
Primarily a research facility, the new Schaeffer Center will investigate how to provide research on health policy and economics, how to offer better care delivery systems, how to regulate and assist with financing and how to train researchers, said Jack Knott, dean of the policy, planning and development school. The center’s ultimate goal will be to produce knowledge for a better health care system.
Knott said the center will focus on real needs, such as those of the aging baby boom generation. The information the research provides will be disseminated to policymakers and the community in hopes of influencing the decision-making process.
The center will also aim to have an international impact.
Neeraj Sood, who will spearhead the center’s international research, said the center hopes to provide an outlet for developing countries to share ideas about health policy reform.
“We will be gathering information from other countries, correcting gaps in our data and providing innovative solutions to help solve their health policy problems,” Sood said.
Sood said the center also intends to hold an annual conference on health policy and economics that will be open to people from all over the world.
“We hope that our research will be mutually beneficial for the US and other economies,” Sood said.
Geoffrey Joyce, associate professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmaceutical economics and policy, said he hopes the Schaeffer Center will make USC one of the leading centers for health policy research.
“By getting a critical mass of health policy and health economics research going, it’s just going to bring in all the talent at USC and make it even stronger,” Joyce said. “There are lots of people who are good researchers at the medical school … but you need a critical mass to develop a major research center and research agenda.”
Joyce said it is important to attract other researchers to take advantage of different perspectives.
“We bring data on millions of people over many years from different sources, private employers, Medicare, Medicaid, so that the data becomes sort of a reason to attract researchers from other disciplines,” Joyce said.
Besides the donation, the Schaeffer Center is also funded by grants various faculty members have received from the National Institute of Health and other federal agencies, according to a press release. Those involved with the center are hoping Schaeffer may donate again down the road.
“We’re hoping that after four years that he will want to endow the center with a larger gift, but if not, the center will be sustained by research grants from the National Institute of Health, the National Institute [on] Aging and other grants,” Knott said.
Dana Goldman, former director of the RAND Corporation’s health economics, finance and organization division, will head the Schaeffer Center.

With operations centered in a small Figueroa Building set against the eastern edge of campus, the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards does not appear threatening on first glance.
But that may prove to be far from the case for some USC students, depending on their particular college experience.
SJACS, created in the early 1980s, was given the task of conducting student reviews in cases where students violated the university’s rules and regulations.
“The university decided to start up a department that would review everything and so it would be as one centralized unit that would adjudicate and keep all the [disciplinary] records for the university,” said Dr. Raquel Torres-Retana, assistant dean and director of SJACS.
A student’s experience with SJACS begins with the submission of a report detailing the alleged violation.
Incident reports prepared by DPS officers initiate the bulk of the cases SJACS pursues, according to Torres-Retana, though no case is pursued until the report is determined to have sufficient evidence to warrant proceeding with the student conduct process. SJACS usually will not follow up on reports based on anonymous calls or those with insufficient details.
A prevalent misconception about SJACS is that it deals with situations where a student is “written up” in university-owned housing.
“If it’s at the [Resident Advisor] level, and it’s a minor incident and it just really has to do with the residential community … it doesn’t come to judicial affairs,” Torres-Retana said.
For more serious issues, students are expected to arrange a meeting with an SJACS hearing officer by a date specified in a letter from the department. The
meeting, a one-on-one review with a hearing officer, is designed to minimize anxiety and intimidation for students.
“I think the media for the most part has portrayed college judicial boards … to be a panel of their peers with 15 people around the table, and that’s not how we do it here at USC,” Torres-Retana said. “It’s an administrative review, so it’s a one-on-one ­— the student who is being written up, or the accused student and the hearing officer.”
After the review, if the hearing officer finds the student is guilty, he or she can choose to either accept or not accept responsibility. If they choose to accept responsibility, the item goes on their disciplinary record but not necessarily on their academic one.
Students have 10 days to appeal the decision before SJACS issues a sanction, which may range from a warning to outright expulsion. According to Torres-Retana, the department aims to teach rather than to punish outright with its sanctions.
“Some of the misconceptions out there are that students are going to go through some type of punitive process and, for the most part, our process and our approach with working with students is developmental,” Torres-Retana said.
Students on the other end of the exchange sometimes feel differently about the efficiency of the process and the applicability of their prescribed sanctions.
According to one sophomore who was written up in December of last year for marijuana and alcohol use, the time between the letter and the scheduled review can often be agonizing.
“The incident happened in December, but we didn’t even get our hearings until, like,
mid-February,” said the student who would only speak under anonymity. “So it took them forever, which was really stressful because you want to know what your
punishment’s going to be.”
As a part of its efforts to educate instead of to simply penalize, SJACS has forged partnerships with the various resource departments throughout the university, such as Health Promotion and Prevention Services and the University Park Health Center. For common alcohol or
drug-related offenses, students have the opportunity to participate in Alcohol and Drug Education Consultation programs, which can include confidential evaluations of their personal substance use and conferences with health professionals.
According to the student, his punishment — when he received it — did not accurately reflect his contestation of the marijuana aspect of his write-up.
“They said, ‘Basically, we’re going to have to keep you on disciplinary probation for the rest of the semester. And, on top of that, we’re going to make you enroll in a two-day drug awareness program … and third you have to write a five-page paper about the positives and negatives of smoking marijuana.’ Even though it said in my report that marijuana wasn’t even in the topic … they still made me write the essay about weed,” the student said.
Ultimately, even if students are unhappy with the process, it is built to help students learn from their mistakes, as well as learn how to avoid disciplinary problems in the future, Torres-Retana said.
“We’re much more about educating students about what they could possibly do, tapping them into resources so they could possibly change their behaviors so they don’t come visit us again,” she said.
SJACS is retarded. They are trying to make SJACS seem like such a good part of the school and is there to help us, which is completely bull. I’ve gone to SJACS once, when I was the victim! Based on all the evidence that I brought to SJACS they said they’d let me off with a warning, and hoped I felt vindicated that the system worked, and made it seem like they were doing me a huge favor. I never did anything wrong, so why would I have felt that way. They just made me come in twice and sweat about getting punished for something I was the victim of, letting it hang over my head to worry about for half a semester.

The members of the No. 2 USC women’s golf team were looking to start strong, but even they didn’t expect this.
“This is the first time we’ve ever won the first game of the season,” coach Andrea Gaston said.
Lizette Salas | Daily Trojan
In a tournament with eight top-10 teams and terrible conditions, the Women of Troy came away with the victory at the Mason Rudolph Championship at the Vanderbilt Legends Golf Club in Franklin, Tenn. The team finished at 16-under 560 (278-282), two strokes ahead of No. 3 UCLA at 10-under 562.
Sophomore Jennifer Song, who had noted in the past that winning an individual tournament was a goal of hers, captured the individual title with a score of 12-under 132 (66-66).
“I just had a great game out there,” Song said of her two bogey-free rounds.
Song rode a hot putter to her first outright victory of her collegiate career.
“The first round I had 26 putts, and the next round I had 27,” she said. “Those putting scores are what I want to have, and they make my score really low.”
Junior Lizette Salas recovered from a rough first round to finish tied for 25th at one-under 143 (74-69).
“Lizette was disappointed in her first round, but she came back very strong in the second round,” Gaston said.
With UCLA closing in on the lead on the back nine of the final round, Salas birdied 17. This, with Song’s closing birdies on 17 and 18 “helped us seal the victory,” according to Gaston.
Senior Caroline Kim and sophomore Inah Park tied for 30th at even par 144, with both shooting 74 in the first round and 70 in the second round. For Park, the round of 70 is her lowest in a collegiate tournament.
Freshman Cyna Rodriguez, making her USC debut, finished tied for 40th at 1-over 145 (72-73).
“Cyna played very well as a freshman,” Gaston said, noting that both of her scores counted towards the team score (the highest individual score is dropped).
The team performed despite bad weather, as the course was wet all weekend and Saturday’s second round was cancelled due to rain.
“It was really soggy, and our new shoes got really messy. I was upset about that,” Song joked.
Despite the conditions, the team was able to put together a very low score without senior All-American Belen Mozo, who is recovering from shoulder surgery.
“This tournament helped us to develop the depth we’re going to need to compete this year,” Gaston said.
That depth will certainly be necessary given the team’s upcoming schedule. Beginning Oct. 16 at the Stanford Invitational, the team has three back-to-back tournaments.
“In between, we’re not going to have too many days to work on things in between,” said Gaston. “The preparation between now and Stanford will really dictate how we close out the fall.”
Though the team is pleased with its historic start, the members know that this tournament doesn’t matter when the national championship rolls around.
“It’s exciting to start off well, but we’re looking to close well in May,” said Gaston. “Our mindset is that we have to work hard because we have a lot of tough competition coming up.”

USC power forward Leonard Washington will be academically ineligible for the rest of the fall semester, coach Kevin O’Neill said Monday.
Washington, a 6-foot-7, 230-pound sophomore from Louisiana, averaged 9.8 points and 6.7 rebounds last season and saw decent playing time despite coming off the bench. A high ankle sprain prevented him from playing in late December and early January, but he was able to recover and join the Trojans in time for their Pac-10 championship run.
Winter break · USC power forward Leonard Washington won’t be available to play when the Trojans open their season in November. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
This is not the first problem that Washington has had with academic clearance at USC. In 2007, when he committed to USC as a senior in high school, Washington did not meet entrance requirements and was forced to spend a year at Compton’s Thurgood Marshall School before enrolling at USC in 2008.
Washington joins the laundry list of USC personnel that will be gone for the start of the 2009 season. The Trojans lost starters Daniel Hackett, Taj Gibson and DeMar DeRozan to the NBA draft, and former coach Tim Floyd resigned in June amid rumors of his connection to an ongoing NCAA investigation. Only senior guard Dwight Lewis returns for the Trojans as a starter in 2009.
If Washington meets the academic requirements, he will be able to return to action by January, near the start of the Pac-10 season.

Senior running back Stafon Johnson was in critical but stable condition Monday evening following a severe throat injury he suffered during a weightlifting accident earlier in the day.
Johnson was bench pressing when the bar slipped from his hands and fell directly on his throat. The running back was rushed to California Hospital Medical Center where he was treated for “crushing injuries to his neck as well as severe lanrygeal injuries,” according to a statement released by the hospital.
Severe accident · Stafon Johnson needed emergency surgery Monday after he dropped a weightlifting bar on his throat. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Carroll said Johnson could not speak after the injury.
According the press release, Dr. Gudata Hinika said Johnson had a threatened airway, but after more than seven hours of surgery, his prognosis was “good.”
Hinika said that he expects Johnson to make a full recovery, but “it is unlikely Mr. Johnson will complete the season,” the press release said.
Although Carroll did not know the amount of weight on the bar or which player or coach was spotting the running back, he did say the accident occurred near the end of Johnson’s reps. Various media outlets reported that Johnson was lifting 275 pounds.
“It was scary,” Carroll said. “That happens sometimes when you’re doing bench press … but this one just hit him wrong.”
Carroll said the injury is not life threatening, but Johnson is expected to miss an extended period of time while he recovers.
“When you’re as connected as we are, we feel every bit of this,” Carroll said.
The accident took place during an organized team workout, and the team’s strength coach was performing the drill with Johnson. Many players were also around when the incident happened and tried to help their injured teammate.
Carroll addressed his entire team following the incident in the Trojans’ locker room. Players, however, were not made available to comment after practice.
“We’re disappointed obviously that he got banged up and he’s hurt,” Carroll said. “We need to find out more when we get a chance.”
In a news release posted on USC’s website earlier in the day, USC’s strength and conditioning coach Chris Carlisle said the accident was a rare case.
“I’ve seen players have the bar slip and fall on their chest, but never in my 25 years of coaching have I heard of someone dropping a bar on their throat,” Carlisle said.
Johnson ­— who leads USC with five touchdowns and is the second leading rusher on the team with 157 rush yards on 32 carries — has been an integral part of the Trojans’ offense for three years. The team will have to find players to step up in his absence.
“Stafon has been a centerpiece to what we’ve been doing, and he won’t be available,” Carroll said. “It will just call on everybody to share the duties a little bit differently. More than that, we’re just disappointed not to have him.”
Carroll said redshirt junior C.J. Gable will likely get more carries. Gable has gained 44 rushing yards on 10 carries in three games this season, and has scored one touchdown.
Johnson is one of a group of players the Trojans will be without in the upcoming weeks.
Sophomore linebacker Jordan Campbell suffered an ankle injury during Saturday’s victory over Washington State, and Carroll said he expects him to miss some time.
Sophomore Shane Horton and senior Luthur Brown are the two most likely candidates to see playing time at Campbell’s position. Carroll also did not rule out junior linebacker Malcolm Smith returning to action this weekend.

USC also announced Sunday evening that junior cornerback Marshall Jones will be out for the remainder of the season with a cracked vertebra in his neck and junior defensive tackle Hebron Fangupo will miss the rest of the year with a broken fibula.
Stafon, I do not know how this happened to you, but being that I am a USC alumni, my heart broke for you.  Take all the time you need to get well…you are in my prayers…  I have a feeling you are a survivor and that his will be behind you soon…FIGHT ON!!
I would suggest investing in some new benches with head cages.  The comment “this stuff happens and this one just hit him wrong” or whatever seems like they just brushed off the severity of this situation.  This kid could have died, but hey it just hit him wrong.  Nice.
I hope he recovers soon. What an awful thing to happen. :(
thank you for keeping us up to date on this special young man
we are so happy that he will recover
we are praying for him

There was only one chance to get the perfect shot. The slightest error would set the script askew.
As the ball careened through the uprights, Tyler Fredrickson skidded to his knees as teammates and thousands of fans rushed onto the Memorial Stadium field to mob him. With a single swift kick, Fredrickson had ended USC’s hopes for a storybook season by toppling the Trojans in a 34-31 triple-overtime thriller.

The senior kicker had given Cal its first win against a top-five team in almost 30 years on that late September night in 2003, the last time the Golden Bears defeated USC. For the burgeoning filmmaker, the moment was fit for Hollywood and a fortuitous climax for an ongoing project.
Fredrickson took on the role of documentarian for the season with his movie Countdown to Kickoff, a 41-minute visual study in the preparation and execution integral to playing college football. But with the intoxication of the landmark win still lingering in the locker room after the USC game, Fredrickson forgot about his work until he bumped into one of his own cameramen.
“I told him that no matter what he couldn’t stop filming,” Fredrickson said. “But other than that one second, I was just enjoying the moment as a player.”
Six years later, Fredrickson’s flair for the dramatic has taken him to USC’s Peter Stark Producing Program, a two-year foray into nearly every element of the film industry. Only 25 graduate students are admitted per year into the group.
But the 28-year-old Fredrickson is the only member taking classes on a campus where he would have once been vilified for daring to cross the Trojans.
“Every so often people will recognize my name and remember that game,” Fredrickson said. “I think USC has won enough titles since then for the moment to have passed, even for the few people here who do remember me from that. But the game pops up on ESPN Classic every now and then, and we’re still talking about it now.“
Getting his kicks
Growing in Santa Barbara, Fredrickson dreamed of suiting up for UCLA.
His playing options out of high school were limited, however, leaving him with the choice to walk-on at Cal and join a team full of lightly recruited players like himself.
He eventually was tabbed as the starting punter and kicker for the Golden Bears, but he was as well known for being named a three-time Academic All-American as he was for his accomplishments on the field.
But his game-clinching kick against the Trojans put him squarely in the limelight.
USC had blocked Frederickson’s previous two kicks, including a routine 30-yard attempt in the first overtime that would have ensured victory for Cal. The kicker was dejected, thinking he had already frittered away his team’s chances before a missed field goal attempt by USC’s Ryan Killeen gave him another opportunity to close the game.
“There’s only so many opportunities you get against USC and if you don’t take advantage of them, it’ll be over,” Fredrickson said.
A quiet confidence washed over Fredrickson when he learned that he would have the chance to win the game.
“I looked him in the eye and he said, ‘Coach, let’s do it,’” Cal coach Jeff Tedford told reporters after the 2003 game.
Fredrickson ranked the kick against the Trojans as the second-most meaningful of his career behind the game-winning field goal of his final collegiate game against Virginia Tech in the Insight Bowl, the perfect exit stage left to his collegiate playing career.
When the chance to play in the NFL presented itself, Fredrickson pursued the unexpected career opportunity, bouncing around to new teams and cities over the course of four years. But there was little joy making a career by kicking professionally, a practice predicated upon precision and repetition.
“It was completely suffocating for me,” Fredrickson said.
The toll of playing professionally reached an apex when, last year, Fredrickson was set to join the Detroit Lions one week before his first Stark classes were scheduled to start. Not ready to give up the career he had become accustomed to, Fredrickson drove to the Los Angeles airport with his wife Jessica, ready to start the grueling process all over again.
But once he parked, Fredrickson could not convince himself to get out of the car.
“My wife was crying and I wasn’t going to put her through it all again,” Fredrickson said. “It was just the emotional exhaustion of it all for both of us. I could have been cut the next week and been right back at where I started.”
A new angle
An admitted “Star Wars nerd,” Fredrickson had a long-standing sense of wonder with movies as a child.
But it wasn’t until his parents’ divorce during his freshman year of high school that he immersed himself in the medium as a form of therapy.
“It became my way of dealing with the stuff I didn’t want to deal with,” Fredrickson said. “I could escape into a story.”
Fredrickson had little production experience beyond his master’s thesis documentary. But he connected with Andy Given, an adjunct professor for Stark and a former golfer at Cal, who helped guide him to the exclusive program.
Once there, Fredrickson learned how to channel the dedication he learned while playing football.
“As a college athlete, you have to be disciplined and organized. Tyler has shown he can be both of those things, and he’s very bright as well,” Given said.
The school has also given Fredrickson the creative outlet he sorely desired during his playing days.
“Being a producer allows you to be in control of all the little facets of the entire process,” Fredrickson said. “I like to guide somebody along the core idea and then see it fulfilled through the production, the post-production and the marketing.”
With a spring graduation from Stark looming, Fredrickson has turned his attention toward the professional world by interning with Sean Daniel, who most notably produced The Mummy franchise. Though the life of a production intern is hardly glamorous, Fredrickson has begun a process that he hopes will one day help him become a producer.
“He’s great at storytelling and that’s the essence of filmmaking,” Given said. “I’m not sure what he’ll do because it’s dependent upon what he wants and what doors open up to him.”
Though he is fully committed to the filmmaking world, football is still a part of Fredrickson’s life. He had planned to play for the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League while attending school this year, but after the AFL suspended operations indefinitely, Fredrickson said he considers himself “unofficially retired.”
Fredrickson said he missed the camaraderie and sense of accomplishment that his collegiate kicking career provided him, but he is looking forward to finding the same fulfillment in his new career.
“If the right playing opportunity came around, I might listen,” Fredrickson said. “But I really love what I’m doing right now and feel like that’s my future.”
Nagoo?
Too bad we cant get Tyler a medical ed shirt and use him this year as our kickers stink up the kitchen!
Either that or get on our hands and knees and beg former USC kicker and now Senior Robbie Taft (Premed student) from Fallbrook to take over…… this dude kicks it into or out of the endzone everytime and wants nothing to do with playing.
Go Bears!
Tyler always has been a class act and continues to show the dedication and loyalty that those who know him love him for.  Best wishes!
