Having lived in California my entire life, I feel like I’ve never had the full Christmas experience. There’s something about waking up every Christmas morning to sunny 60-degree blue skies that kind of takes away from the “magic” of the holiday. Every year during the holidays my family and I watch Love Actually (arguably my favorite film of all time), and I always envied how spectacularly beautiful it would be to spend the holidays in a place like London. When I was accepted into this program for the fall semester, I have no shame admitting that one of my first thoughts was how amazing it was going to be to be able to spend Christmas here. Yet what I never could have imagined was that my expectations would be far surpassed.
I have never seen any place that goes as crazy for Christmas as I’ve witnessed here. Every single street, no matter how fancy the area, is completely decked out in sparkly Christmas lights. There’s a different Christmas market every day. Restaurants and pubs transform their menus to include Christmas specials, and the amount of different spots you can go ice-skating is overwhelming. Not to say my lovely California home state doesn’t offer these options, but there’s something different about ice skating around a huge Christmas tree when it’s actually cold outside, or walking down the decorated streets in appropriate winter gear as you sip your hot chocolate. Another reason I think there’s so much hype surrounding Christmas is the fact that there’s no Thanksgiving in the U.K. Because of this, the celebrations begin as early as the beginning of November. As a result, the anticipation and excitement leading up to the holiday is maximized.

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what is so special about Christmas in London. All I know is that all of a sudden, I’ve found myself planning my days around which Christmas street market I want to check out, or which spots are selling the best mulled wine. Being in London has made me more obsessed with the holiday than I already was at home.
Whether it’s because I’m from California, or the fact that there’s so much pre-celebration, the holidays here are really quite spectacular. Perhaps if I grew up somewhere like New York I wouldn’t be so mind boggled by the pure beauty I see in London every day, whether I’m walking down a random street in my neighborhood or at Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland.

Christmas here, more than in the States, feels more authentic to me. That might in part be due to the fact that all the Christmas craziness is actually accompanied by cold weather, but there’s something about the holiday here that feels much less commercialized. Though a lot of Christmas is about the cute holiday advertisements that go viral on YouTube, or the big Macy’s sales, that commercial craziness hasn’t been as apparent to me here in London.
For me, the holidays in London seem more about cherishing friends and family and less about the money or brands. People here are so passionate about Christmas and get so enthusiastic about all the holiday festivities that it makes it much more enjoyable to experience because it all comes from such a genuine place.
Whether or not native Brits shared this sentiment, I’m so grateful I have had the opportunity to spend a portion of the holiday season here. Everyone has always talked about how amazing London is around Christmas, but I could have never imagined it would be this wonderful. I’m surrounded by such beauty and joy everywhere I go, and in my final days here I’m going to continue taking full advantage of the British Christmas spirit.

Bright lights drape trees, and hints of peppermint, gingerbread and eggnog fill coffee shops and kitchens — the time of year we’ve all been waiting for has finally rolled around. 
As college students, we might not have the means to make or spend a lot on gifts for friends and family. But one of the best ways to showcase your holiday joy and spirit is by making and giving someone a homemade gift. For this holiday season, try making your own treats to give to your loved ones! They’re both sweet and easy to make, and require no oven. These are the perfect cost and dorm friendly treats for anyone who have just a microwave and fridge at their disposal.
1. Decorated Oreos

For this holiday treat you will need:
***If you don’t have oreos, you can also dip pretzels or pretzel rods in chocolate and roll them in colorful sprinkles or nuts.

Leftover chocolate is great for dipping. Placing marshmallows on peppermint candy cane sticks and dipping in chocolate and peppermint makes for a great snack or even better, a hot chocolate stirrer! 
For this holiday treat you will need:
This is a great snack as is, or can be used to stir into some hot chocolate for an extra chocolatey and minty taste with a marshmallow included!

Lastly, a creative gift to give to someone is a treat they can make on their own! Placing dry baking ingredients in a glass Mason jar makes for a great presentation and a great gift your friend or family member can make on their own. I added in red and green chocolate M&Ms to accentuate the Christmas spirit for these holiday cookies! Adding ribbons or decorative cards with recipe instructions would be a good addition too.
