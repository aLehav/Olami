For any newspaper, full disclosure is more important than irreproachable objectivity. As commendable as the work of a student journalist is, there’s a difference between a Daily Trojan writer and a professional. Writers are students in an environment where even a handful of extracurricular activities can easily seem like too few. With students stretched so thin, conflicts of interests are inevitable, making it especially important for editors to be watchful and open with readers.
One Aug. 28 sports column, “New site breaks the fantasy football mold,” broke, if inadvertently, that rule of transparency. In his praising coverage of a new fantasy football website, the writer, a sports columnist, neglected to mention that he had worked for the site over the summer. He later recognized his mistake, and told me that in his haste to put a story together, he didn’t recognize the potential for a conflict of interest.
At any newspaper, there are groups, organizations, interests and individuals — they all compete for space. Often, the toughest decision for an editor is who or what to cover, and which writer is responsible for covering that subject. The content of a newspaper is different from its advertising because it’s interesting to the reader and comes from someone who does not stand to gain from its publication.
Editor in Chief Alexander Comisar explained that in college, commitments can overlap more than at the professional level.
“Our writers and editors live multifaceted lives. They are full-time students who involve themselves with all kinds of different jobs, internships and campus activities — and we are proud of that reality,” he said. “At the same time, we make a very serious commitment to minimizing any ostensible effect these other activities might have on the integrity of our editorial content.”
A column is different from a reported article because of the level of opinion permitted. If a reporter takes on a story about swine flu, increased rush numbers or a tennis match, he is expected to relay the facts objectively. But an opinion columnist is allowed to take aim at the administration and a sports columnist is certainly allowed to highlight a new website he believes is of interest to Daily Trojan readers.
The problem here was that in choosing to write about the same company that he worked for over the summer, the author called motive into question. Although opinion is permitted, self-serving promotion is not.
“I had no malicious intent and I didn’t purposefully write it knowing that it presented a conflict of interest,” the writer said. “I simply wanted to write about a website that I thought was pretty cool and was doing something that was unique in the fantasy football community.”
“Had I known well in advance that he had previously worked for Pyromaniac.com, I probably would have asked him to choose a different topic,” Sports Editor Josh Jovanelly said.
An editor’s note explaining the relationship between the writer and the website would also have helped, Jovanelly noted.

If 2008 was any indication, the 2009 USC women’s cross country team should enjoy quite the season in the next few months.
Despite only having one runner on scholarship last year, the USC women’s cross country team competed valiantly in the loaded Pac-10 conference and performed strongly at both the conference championships and NCAA regionals.

“We’re coming off a year where I would have to say we overachieved and definitely exceeded my expectations,” said coach Tom Walsh. “We do have the toughest conference in the country, but I’m proud of the way we’ve progressed over the last few years.”
Led by junior standout Zsofia Erdelyi, who last year qualified for the NCAA championships as an individual, and senior team captain Bridget Helgerson, the Women of Troy figure to be right in the thick of the Pac-10 competition again this year.
“We bring back five of our top seven runners from last year,” Walsh said. “We’re trying to equal or better what we did last year and be in the middle of the pack of the Pac-10, which is no slouch.”
“We definitely want to improve on last year,” said Erdelyi, who added that her personal goal is a return to nationals.
Walsh’s praise for the strength of the Pac-10 conference is no understatement. Perennial powerhouses Oregon and Washington figure to be two of the top teams in the country, with Stanford, Arizona and Arizona State all expected to field exceptionally strong squads as well. Facing such daunting competition, Walsh continues to set strong goals that remain rooted in reality.
“Washington and Oregon are a notch above everyone else,” Walsh said. “But we can still compete. And we always want to beat our rival UCLA. That gauntlet competition between the two schools is important. We really want to beat them and do well in the Pac-10.”
To accomplish that, the Women of Troy will have to overcome several injuries, and get key contributions from new faces on the team. Several veteran runners, including Erdelyi, will not compete at this Saturday’s Cal State Fullerton Invitational, although Walsh hopes that this will actually benefit the team later.
“It’s still early in the season and some of our top runners who are going to have a longer season won’t participate at this meet because we hope to have them going through the middle of November,” Walsh said. “On the upside, it’s a good chance to see where all the newcomers are at.”
Those newcomers include freshman Kelly Owen from Palos Verdes and redshirt sophomore Shea Wickland, who as a track and field runner finished third in the 5,000-meter run at the UCLA dual meet in May.
“It’s definitely exciting to come here and immediately be in the middle of such a competitive conference.” Owen said. “I really want to contribute and help this team go deep in the Pac-10.”
Where exactly USC ends up in the Pac-10 hierarchy will be determined by a schedule that includes a return to the Stanford Invitational on Sept. 26 and the Women of Troy’s first chance to host the Pac-10 Championships since 1999.
“We’re excited to host,” Walsh said of the championships, which will be held Oct. 30 at Skylinks Golf Course in Long Beach. “The girls really want to do well because they know that there will be people coming to the race and they want to show well in front of the USC fans.”
Although several exciting races lie ahead, for now Walsh is focused on the task at hand.
“We’re just eager to get to the first meet and see where we’re at,” he said. “Everyone’s come back in really good shape, but there’s always room to improve.”

The No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team (2-1) is looking to extend its winning streak to three games tonight against Florida Gulf Coast (1-2) as USC kicks off its home portion of the 2009 schedule at 7 p.m. at the Holiday Inn LA City Center Trojan Invitational in the Galen Center.
After dropping their first match of the season last week to Michigan State in five sets, the Women of Troy rebounded to sweep North Carolina and Albany and end the Michigan State Tournament on a high note last Saturday.

Following tonight’s game, the Women of Troy will take on No. 21 Pepperdine (3-0) tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Northern Arizona (1-2) Saturday at 10 a.m.
Pepperdine is undefeated on the season after sweeping the Colorado State Asics Classic in Fort Collins, Colo., last weekend with wins over then-No. 24 Colorado State, Cal Poly and Oregon State. USC leads the all-time season series between the two teams, 36-8.
Northern Arizona defeated Boise State and lost to Cal State Northridge and Tulsa last weekend in Boise, Idaho. This is also the first-ever meeting in women’s volleyball between USC and Northern Arizona.

We’ve all heard it: A true freshman has never started a season at quarterback for the Trojans.
But that will all change on Saturday, when No. 4 USC opens its season in historic fashion against San Jose State at the Coliseum in front of 90,000 screaming fans.
When Pete Carroll chose Barkley to be his starter over redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp one week ago, many were shocked. Even Barkley admitted he was caught off guard.
“I was speechless when coach told me,” the 18-year-old said.
And even Carroll was at somewhat of a loss when trying to explain why he chose a freshman quarterback rather than going with his usual pick of a veteran to man the offense.
“I can’t explain how a guy this young and this new could do that, but he’s done it,” the coach said.
Carroll and his coaching staff clearly saw something they’d never seen in a freshman quarterback before. And I’m talking about more than his 6-foot-3, 220-pound frame and rifle of an arm.
So now Barkley is set to start the season for the Trojans. And for the first time since a true freshman named Carson Palmer took the over the starting quarterback job from Mike Van Raaphorst during the last five games of the 1998 season, the quarterback position at USC may be occupied by one man for four seasons.
So this brings up an interesting topic. If Barkley develops the way the coaches expect him to, he will have three to four full seasons at quarterback before entering the NFL draft.
So while many people are focusing on the history Barkley will be making when he takes his first snap Saturday, I’d rather look at the potential history Barkley could make when he takes his last snap in what could be four years from now.
Let’s take a look at what I consider the three gaudiest quarterback records and see what Barkley’s odds are of reaching them. This is, of course, assuming Barkley stays for his senior year with USC, just like Palmer, who holds most of USC’s passing records.
The first number I look at is 11,818. That’s the record Palmer holds for most yards gained passing as a Trojan. It’s also a Pac-10 record.
If Barkley stays a full four years in college, he would need to average 2,955 passing yards per season to pass Palmer as the all-time USC and Pac-10 leader.
Just to put that number in perspective, look at how quarterbacks have fared under Carroll’s system during their first years in the starting role.
Last season, Mark Sanchez threw for 3,207 yards. In 2006, John David Booty threw for 3,347 yards. And in 2003, Matt Leinart threw for 3,556 yards.
In Palmer’s first full year as a starter in 2000, he threw for 2,914 yards.
Simply put, the record is within reach.
Palmer also holds the school and Pac-10 record for the most passes completed during a career with 927.
In four years, Barkley would need to average 232 completions to top that record.
Sanchez completed 313 passes in 2008, Booty completed 269 passes in 2006 and Leinart completed 255 passes in 2003. All of those numbers are higher than what Barkley needs to reach each season.
Palmer himself only completed 228 passes his first full year, slightly lower than the 232 completions Barkley needs to average, but Palmer ended his senior year in 2002 with a whopping 309 completions.
Barkley, like Palmer and all young quarterbacks, will be expected to gradually improve each season as well.
That puts 938 in reach for Barkley.
And the last number I want to look at is passing touchdowns.
Leinart set the record at 99 during his time in college, both a USC and Pac-10 record.
It’s not hard to do the math here. If Barkley averages 25 passing touchdowns over the next four seasons, he will reach the magical number of 100 only attained by six other college quarterbacks in the history of the sport.
So one more time, look at the numbers.
In each of their respective first full seasons starting, Sanchez threw 34 touchdowns, Booty threw 29 touchdowns and Leinart threw 38 touchdowns.
Again, all of these numbers are higher than what Barkley needs to average in four seasons. The only difference for those previous quarterbacks is they did not have the opportunity to start four full seasons at quarterback for USC.
Barkley will.
Just by breaking it down, it’s easy to tell there is a solid chance, if Barkley stays, that he will own arguably the most prestigious of USC quarterback records when all is said and done.
So when you step into the Coliseum or turn on the television to watch the game Saturday, you will be witnessing history right away as Barkley takes his first snap.
But remember, it may not be the last time the true freshman puts his name in the record books.

Despite returning nine starters, USC’s offense will have a distinctly new look when the starting unit is introduced Saturday.
Although true freshman Matt Barkley has stolen the headlines, the Trojans’ offense will also shuffle in new starters, most notably at running back.
First up · Running back Joe McKnight is the starter for Saturday’s season opener, but he will split carries with at least three teammates. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
USC coach Pete Carroll announced earlier in the week that junior Joe McKnight would start at running back, earning the third start of his career. Redshirt junior C.J. Gable was USC’s most frequent starter last year but shared carries with McKnight and senior Stafon Johnson. Redshirt junior Allen Bradford is also expected to figure into this year’s rotation.
“We’re going to have a lot of talent back there, and that’s a good problem to have,” said quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, who enters his first year as USC’s playcaller. “They all have a special role.”
Carroll praised McKnight at his Tuesday press conference for his versatility but also reiterated that the tailback rotation would work itself out.
Johnson, who led the team with 738 rushing yards on a team-high 138 carries last year, said he wasn’t discouraged by the decision.
“I’ve only been the starter for one game in my career, so it doesn’t really matter to me,” he said. “I don’t really know what the coaches are going to do, so you just have to be ready when the opportunity comes.”
Barkley, who was not made available to the media on Wednesday, looked sharp throughout most of the practice. He connected with projected starting receivers redshirt junior Damian Williams and redshirt junior David Ausberry repeatedly throughout the day.
His lone error came at the end of the 11-on-11 session, when sophomore cornerback T.J. Bryant jumped a route and intercepted a pass.
Despite Barkley’s inexperience, Carroll said Barkley would have the same freedom to audible plays that past USC quarterbacks have had. But the freshman will not be able to call any play at will.
“There are options within each play and concepts that guide the choices they have,” Carroll said.
Saturday will also be Bates’ official debut to the collegiate game. Past USC playcallers, such as Norm Chow, Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian, have all been the subject of much fan speculation. But having served as the playcaller for the NFL’s Denver Broncos last year, Bates was confident that he would be prepared for the demands of the position.
“This is a game of entertainment, and fans pay a lot of money to go to the games, so they’re going to have their opinions,” Bates said. “But we’re focused and can’t listen to the distractions.”
u
The Trojans received a verbal commitment on Wednesday from one of the top senior high school football players, wide receiver Kyle Prater from Proviso West High School in Illinois.
Prater, who is ranked as the No. 2 player in the country by Rivals.com, announced his decision at his high school. Verbal commitments are nonbinding until a player signs a letter of intent, but ESPN.com reported that Prater plans to graduate in December and enroll at USC for the spring semester.

The World Cup. The Super Bowl. The World Series.
Every sport has its championship competition.
Big stage · Daniel Nguyen, along with soon-to-be teammate J.T. Sundling, gets his shot at the US Open. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
For tennis, one of the more renowned and prestigious competitions is the US Open.
Today, USC sophomore Daniel Nguyen and freshman J.T. Sundling will compete in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., at that very tournament.
“It’s definitely one of the highlights in my tennis career,” Nguyen said.
“This is definitely the coolest thing I’ve ever done,” Sundling added.
It’s not much of a surprise that the two teenagers, who have known each other since they were nine, would find success as a doubles pair. Nguyen played a key role in USC’s NCAA team championship in May and while Sundling leaves high school as one of the more decorated players in the nation.
To earn a wildcard entry into the tournament, the pair, who had the No. 1 seed, won the Boys 18s National Outdoor Hardcourt Championship in Kalamazoo, Mich. Each year the doubles and singles champions earn a draw in the US Open.
“Well we were both really excited before we got here, but once we got here and we see how they treat all the players, it’s pretty amazing,” Sundling said.
But the road to the US Open has not been easy for the Trojan duo. While they defeated their first four opponents in Kalamazoo in straight sets, semifinal competition proved to be more challenging.
Nguyen and Sundling lost the first set 4-6 to Mitchell Frank and Junior Ore, but came roaring back in the second to take it 6-0. The third set ended in a 6-4 decision for Nguyen and Sundling, advancing them to the final round.
The final round was no less of a challenge. With Sundling serving at 4-5 in the first set, Sekou Coker Bangoura and Nathan Pasha had several opportunities to close out the set. Sundling and Nguyen, however, fought back to take the set 7-6(2) and the next set 6-3 to secure their ticket to New York.
“The semis and the finals were tough,” Nguyen said. “We almost lost the first set in the final. We were down three set points so it was really close.”
Sundling and Nguyen are no strangers to the Kalamazoo tournament. Back in 2006, when the duo first teamed up, they walked away with a doubles championship in the Boys 16s age group. That should have earned them a ticket to the US Open juniors, but luck was not on their side and they did not receive the wildcard entry.
This year, however, a dream becomes a reality for both Sundling and Nguyen as they take off for New York to compete against world-class tennis players.
“I’ve been dreaming about it since I was a kid, being here with all the tennis players that I look up to,” Nguyen said. “Just seeing Roger Federer in the locker room and saying, ‘What’s up?’”
As expected when dealing with a tournament as prestigious as the US Open, the first round competition for Sundling and Nguyen will be far from easy. First up for the Trojan duo are Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco of Argentina.
The Argentinean pair has enjoyed steady careers in professional tennis, with Monaco earning more  than $2 million in prize money. In 2008, Monaco and Gonzalez teamed up at the US Open and reached the semifinal round before being eliminated.
“We’re just going to take each match point by point and see how it goes,” Nguyen said.
Former Trojan and NCAA doubles champion [with now senior Robert Farah] Kaes Van’t Hof will also compete in the US Open doubles competition.
In the 2009 NCAA season, Nguyen teamed up with Abdullah Magdas in doubles en route to a team title. Magdas has since completed his eligibility and will be the only member of the 2009 championship squad not returning. Sundling, however, seems like he’ll fit in just fine on the championship team as well as possibly in the role of Nguyen’s doubles partner.
“We complement each other,” Nguyen said. “He’s got a big serve and I’ve got a great return.”

It is said that USC’s football team does not rebuild, but, rather, reloads, and the same can be said for at least one other team at USC this year.
The USC men’s water polo team is coming off of two national championships in four years and a perfect 29-0 season in 2008. And as a new season approaches, it seems to be business as usual for the Trojans.

“I have no doubt that we’ll have the best team in the country this year, but it’s just a matter of how we approach the season,” said senior two-meter Jordan Thompson.
Thompson joins two-meters J.W. Krumpholz and Shea Buckner, and driver Matt Sagehorn as part of a nine-member senior class that has had more than its fair share of experience winning matches.
Krumpholz, the 2008 recipient of the Peter J. Cutino award (annually given out to the top player in men’s water polo), leads a returning offense that accounted for most of the Trojans’ scoring last season. Sagehorn, Buckner and senior Justin Rappel all played a large role in the offense, with each scoring at least 20 goals last year.
“The senior class we have has been outstanding, and the experience of playing in so many games together is a big part of it,” said coach Jovan Vavic, who recorded his 300th career win at USC last season. “What makes this class so special is it’s very balanced. It’s difficult to have so many guys stay together.”
Overall, six of USC’s starters, five of whom are All-Americans, return from last year’s championship team, including goalkeeper and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Newcomer of the Year Joel Dennerley. Dennerley anchored a Trojans’ defense last season that allowed the fewest goals out of any team in the nation and was considered by some to be one of the greatest defenses in collegiate history.
While the returning starters are a cause for optimism, the Trojans did lose a large part of the defense, with the departure of team leaders Arjan Ligtenberg and Jovan Vranes. The two had been on the team since USC’s last national championship season in 2005 and provided the Trojans with skill and experience in the driver position.
Both Ligtenberg and Vranes earned All-American second- team honors in 2008, and played a pivotal role in shutting down Stanford’s offense in last years’ national title match.
“Arjan and Jovan were huge players on our team. Defensively, yeah, it’s going to be challenging,” said Buckner of his former teammates. “They filled a lot of holes and did a lot of roles that were really valuable to the team. I think we’re going to recover from it, maybe even excel, but yeah, it’s definitely going to be hard.”
USC will get its first test without Vranes and Ligtenberg this upcoming weekend when it competes in the Triton Invitational tournament in La Jolla, Calif.
Last year, the Trojans swept the tournament, but it was not without struggle. After demolishing Division-III Claremont, 28-2, USC met head-on with Loyola Marymount University in the semifinals. The Trojans jumped out to a 6-2 lead, but LMU fought to bring the game to sudden death.
USC was able to salvage the victory with a late goal, which effectively paved the way for a spot in the championship, an eventual tournament win and an undefeated season.
USC will play in three tournaments this season — the Triton, NorCal, and SoCal invitationals — in addition to the MPSF and NCAA championship tournaments at the end of the year. Several key regular season matchups for the Trojans are sprinkled throughout their schedule, with the Cal game in early October and the Stanford and UCLA games in mid-November.
“We always look forward to playing [Cal],” said Buckner of USC’s highly anticipated games. “Stanford, we want to give it to them too, so we’re definitely excited for that match. UCLA as well. All those games are huge.”
And as with any team finding consistent success year in and year out, the target on the Trojans’ head only seems to grow.
“It’s expected that we’re going to be out there to compete,” added Thompson. “Obviously last year was an incredible anomaly, and we’re going to have a little bit extra pressure on us. I’m excited.”

Remember Prometheus?
He stole fire from the gods and gave the gift to mankind. As a result, he was sentenced to the grisly fate of having his liver eaten by a bird every day while chained to a lonely rock.
It must have been hard for the poor guy to watch his own guts be chewed up day in and day out.
It’s probably similar to the feeling that evacuees from the California wildfires felt this past week. Not only are they displaced from their homes, they get to see, breathe and smell all the evidence from their temporary high-school-turned-shelter bases.
My parents live on the mountain opposite Angeles National Forest, the origin of Station fire. On a weekend visit home, driving down the Glendale Freeway North was like descending into hell: a narrow passage lined with smoke that smelled like smouldering charcoal. Raging flames traveled down the dark valley in a V formation.
Such smoke goes through the seemingly impermeable walls of home and childhood memories, and even the moon glows orange with alarm and the sun red with disappointment during fire season.
The vapors reduce people to mucus-leaking messes and yet some cyclists still insisted on their regular route Sunday morning.
Contrary to the alarm seen on headlines and on the radio, a fire up close is quiet, even anticlimactic — there are no close-up shots or crackling noises as zealous TV reporters form puns from the field, preying on poor, panicked residents donning facemasks. It’s not my first fire; I remember as a young girl packing clothes in anticipation of evacuating right around Christmas, peeking out the window to look at the firefighters parked on the street.
In this wildfire, there was just the unassuming hum of small planes and helicopters playing voyeur, dropping water and releasing clouds of red powder to no avail.
It becomes more real when you can see it not from the window of the TV or translated onto newsprint, but rather through your bedroom window.
This is no rote public service announcement played between after-school specials with cuddly bears. It’s not something you think about when the city posts fire warnings and spends money on cleaning up brush — the efforts seem almost comical with its friendly graphics. Growing up, I grew used to the sight of mountain goats annually making an appearance on my hillside to graze on the shrubs that had grown comfortable along the undeveloped ledges.
Their ears tagged with yellow plastic and RV-driving shepherd felt almost humorous, a county joke – like some city employee got dared to spend tax money on something that involved goats and a dusty old trailer.
These efforts are reserved for the hills because it is here in these hills we Angelenos covet houses — as if they were seats in the pantheon of the gods, sucking electricity and water out of the valleys to fuel custom home entertainment systems and to fill saltwater infinity pools. These are the houses on the front of mass-produced realtor handouts, peeking above the smog.
Angelenos play with fire everyday — we breathe in it as we drive everywhere, and we manipulate it to warm us, keep us entertained, keep us fed. But we forget the punishment Prometheus endured for rubbing two sticks together.
Mountains surround Los Angeles, and when they are on fire they send signals to everyone else — warnings that they might be next. It’s a cyclical, natural and  all-too-depressing reminder that Angelenos don’t have full power to control the smoke.
Everyone in Los Angeles must experience fire. It’s an annual preoccupation that occurs both in the city and in the wilderness, though some may have trouble seeing the difference. Destruction is still the end result.
We embrace fire with a dual mentality — either with a sense of perseverance or one of recklessness. It’s a communal and seasonal event that demands fear and respect — a humbling experience that reminds us proud hill dwellers that no matter how nice the car in the garage is, no amount of freeway lanes can harness the rage of heat and dry brush.
In Pasadena, Altadena or my parents’ suburban street in Glendale, people parked haplessly to stop and look at the spectacle rising in the distance, cameras in hand.
We all still watch, with open mouths. In Los Angeles, fire simply is a matter of taking turns.
Armageddon seems to happen every year. We, like Prometheus, dread feeling the horror in our own neighborhood after another part of the city has rebuilt itself — but we keep our houses on the hills and stubbornly stay behind, battling flames with mere garden hoses.
It is our chosen fate: to continue another chapter in Los Angeles mythology.

Writer-director Rob Zombie possesses a lot of ambition that has yet to be perfected. His new film, Halloween 2, which itself is a sequel to his 2007 remake of John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher classic Halloween, clearly illustrates that while Zombie has a long way to go, he is certainly heading in the right direction.
Zombie’s latest remake picks up a few hours after the first film of the franchise ends — with the iconic mask-wearing killer Michael Myers presumed dead and en route to the morgue. But after a freak accident during transportation, Myers — who turns out to be very much alive — escapes custody.

Then there is Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton), one of the few survivors from the film’s predecessor who, even after a year, is still completely terrified and convinced that Myers will come back. The trauma from the first film has left her with horrible nightmares in which she witnesses Myers’ carnage repeatedly before she is murdered as well.
While some remain paralyzed from the horror of the previous film, others, primarily Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), have been profiting from Myers’ exploits with the release of a book that chronicles Myers’ brutality.
Then, to everyone’s dismay, Myers comes back to town on Halloween night to finish what he started. From here, the bodies begin to pile up and the sadistic murder scenes continue to gain momentum; each one far more extreme than the one before it, almost to the point of exhaustion — emphasis on “almost,” only because there is something savagely surreal in the way Zombie directs Myers’ mayhem.
Zombie has a solid style for depicting brutality that few can replicate. His direction has a prominence here that is dominated by unique color schemes, surprisingly interesting angles and a raw expression that makes it all the more grisly.
The problem with this, as with many slasher films, is that it is not enough. No matter how provocative it may be for Myers to stab someone with a large kitchen knife, even capturing all of the terror considerably well, watching him do it more than 10 times to the same victim becomes incredibly tiring.
Each murder is taken to the extreme, and while it works in some instances, loading the entire film with this mantra does not. Less killing would have been better for the film. That would have given Zombie more time and energy to develop the other characters as well as the overall plot.
Nothing really happens in Halloween 2 — nothing new anyway. Myers comes back to town, kills a lot of people and tries to reunite his family by making contact with his long-lost sister — quite similar to his actions in the first film. Add that to almost wretched dialogue in some scenes that is way too stereotypically corny, and the narrative of  the film as a whole does not add up to much.
Zombie attempts to focus much of his film on the notion of family and the psychological effects it always has on an individual’s personality, especially when that individual is mentally disturbed.
Some of the film’s more interesting scenes try to convey the psychological trauma Myers endures, and provide a much-needed break from the killing. This is another clever aspect of the film that shows promise, but, similarly to Zombie’s other fascinating attributes, it desperately needs further development.
Yes, Halloween 2 is a slasher film and there should be an emphasis on the slashing, but Zombie has the ability to make it much more than your typical slasher film. The fact that it only cuts at the surface is disappointing.
Zombie has talent; there is no doubt about it. His 2005 film The Devil’s Rejects highlights his ambitious style of filmmaking, which continues to improve, but again the lack of story and blatant overexposure of graphic violence get in the way of his ability to fully control his determination and talent.
But if Halloween 2 says anything about its director, it is that he will one day make a good film that will be able to tie up all loose ends while satisfying his lust for blood. The real question is, how many meager offerings will audiences have to stomach before he does?

At just 24 years old, Los Angeles resident Sean Carlson has made quite the name for himself throughout the local underground music scene over the past several years — but not as a performer.
While most music-loving 20-somethings possess unrealistic dreams of lucrative recording contracts, Carlson took his appreciation for Los Angeles’ vibrant arts scene and turned it into something a rare few can pull off — a successful independent music festival.

Now in its sixth year, FYF Fest — formerly called F Yeah Fest — promises one of its largest and most ambitious lineups to date, adding art exhibitions, a variety of food vendors, a zine library and even a kissing booth in conjunction with the day’s 33 scheduled performances.
This Saturday, the festival moves several miles north of its usual indoors Echo Park locale to the Los Angeles State Historic Park in Downtown’s Chinatown neighborhood. In addition to a new name and a new venue, FYF Fest also seeks to bring awareness to the current condition of the state park system — a moved prompted by Carlson’s outrage against California’s recently proposed budget cuts.
“The main demographic [at the festival] is going to be between the ages of 18 to 30, and most of those people don’t know about the budget cuts,” Carlson said. “A lot of young people don’t follow up on the news — I’m not saying all of them, but a decent amount. I blame myself as well. But, if we can put on an event and put a cause behind it that we believe in — like the parks — that could help.”
Carlson organized the first incarnation of the event — a series of performances scattered throughout the Echo Park neighborhood — in 2004 when he was just 18 years old.
“I didn’t really know what I was doing,” he mused. “I asked a lot of my friends for help, we used smaller bands … It was something that was a bit unorganized and chaotic, but really fun at the same time.”
This did not mean, however, that Carlson’s first foray into the concert promotion world would be without  pitfalls. Carlson’s the first to admit that the inaugural festival was a “complete failure.”
“Even though 2,000 people showed up, I decided to make [the concert] free and I think I walked away with about $4,” Carlson said. “The next year, we decided to charge $6. It went over really well, and it kind of grew from there … It was just this natural progression of growing from a grassroots punk festival into an event that was actually something.”
As time passed, the festival — still bearing the name F Yeah Fest — evolved from a local, underground secret into a nationally recognized event known for discovering and promoting a colorful assortment of independent musicians who would eventually become synonymous with the country’s burgeoning pop scene.
Yet for all of the indie-world notables peppering this year’s FYF Fest lineup, Carlson is quick to dismiss notions that he and his fellow festival organizers are hip, Pitchfork-savvy tastemakers.
“I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, we’re ahead of the curve!’ But there’s definitely a few bands that break out every year after the festival,” he said, citing performers such as Los Angeles darlings No Age and Memphis’ Jay Reatard, who found considerable successes in the years following their appearances at Carlson’s event.
“There’s always a few bands on the bill that no one has heard of at the time,” Carlson said.” That’s what’s really important to us — bringing in these smaller bands and giving them the opportunity to play.”
Saturday’s lineup includes a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from hardcore punk bands (Fucked Up, Converge), electronica-driven acts (Glass Candy, Telepathe) and experimentally bent groups (Lightning Bolt). A handful of key players in the independent music world — such as Dan Deacon, Wavves and Black Lips — are also scheduled to perform.
“We may not have mega headliners like the Flaming Lips or Grizzly Bear or MIA,” Carlson noted, speaking of successful performers within the greater indie contingent. “But we have some very well known, very well respected bands. We tried to make the lineup as eclectic as possible; we are flying bands in from all over the country that people don’t necessarily know of.”
And while annual music festivals with similar lineups — for instance, the Pitchfork Music Festival and the Coachella Valley Music and Art Festival — charge as much as $100 for a day pass, attendees of FYF Fest can delight in the fact that tickets to Saturday’s event remain notably inexpensive: pre-purchased tickets are $20, while those purchased at the door will cost $25.
Carlson cites his admiration of legendary punk band Fugazi’s infamous $5 ticket prices as the inspiration for FYF’s affordability.
“Everyone’s broke — but I want people to go out and enjoy themselves. It’s Labor Day weekend, but you might not have the money to travel … I have [Fugazi’s] ethic — I don’t want to charge a lot of money because if it was $40 or $50, I wouldn’t go. I don’t want to put on a show that I wouldn’t attend,” Carlton said.
Despite the large amount of publicity and buzz surrounding this year’s FYF Fest, Carlson’s hopes for the event remain as humble as they were in 2004.
“I really encourage students who are just looking for something to do, who don’t want to go to a frat party or sit in the dorms or wander around Figueroa to come do this,” Carlson said, beaming. “I love it when there’s people [at the event] who don’t know what to expect because it’s all a mystery to them. That makes it so much better.”
And Carlson’s advice for FYF Fest newbies unfamiliar with the lineup?
“Pick and see bands you’ve never ever heard of,” he explained. “That’s the whole point — walk around, check out a new band, have some ice cream, hang out, have a good time.”

For any newspaper, full disclosure is more important than irreproachable objectivity. As commendable as the work of a student journalist is, there’s a difference between a Daily Trojan writer and a professional. Writers are students in an environment where even a handful of extracurricular activities can easily seem like too few. With students stretched so thin, conflicts of interests are inevitable, making it especially important for editors to be watchful and open with readers.
One Aug. 28 sports column, “New site breaks the fantasy football mold,” broke, if inadvertently, that rule of transparency. In his praising coverage of a new fantasy football website, the writer, a sports columnist, neglected to mention that he had worked for the site over the summer. He later recognized his mistake, and told me that in his haste to put a story together, he didn’t recognize the potential for a conflict of interest.
At any newspaper, there are groups, organizations, interests and individuals — they all compete for space. Often, the toughest decision for an editor is who or what to cover, and which writer is responsible for covering that subject. The content of a newspaper is different from its advertising because it’s interesting to the reader and comes from someone who does not stand to gain from its publication.
Editor in Chief Alexander Comisar explained that in college, commitments can overlap more than at the professional level.
“Our writers and editors live multifaceted lives. They are full-time students who involve themselves with all kinds of different jobs, internships and campus activities — and we are proud of that reality,” he said. “At the same time, we make a very serious commitment to minimizing any ostensible effect these other activities might have on the integrity of our editorial content.”
A column is different from a reported article because of the level of opinion permitted. If a reporter takes on a story about swine flu, increased rush numbers or a tennis match, he is expected to relay the facts objectively. But an opinion columnist is allowed to take aim at the administration and a sports columnist is certainly allowed to highlight a new website he believes is of interest to Daily Trojan readers.
The problem here was that in choosing to write about the same company that he worked for over the summer, the author called motive into question. Although opinion is permitted, self-serving promotion is not.
“I had no malicious intent and I didn’t purposefully write it knowing that it presented a conflict of interest,” the writer said. “I simply wanted to write about a website that I thought was pretty cool and was doing something that was unique in the fantasy football community.”
“Had I known well in advance that he had previously worked for Pyromaniac.com, I probably would have asked him to choose a different topic,” Sports Editor Josh Jovanelly said.
An editor’s note explaining the relationship between the writer and the website would also have helped, Jovanelly noted.

Fact: Michael Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm on June 25, 2009.
Fact: The Los Angeles County coroner’s office has come out and declared that the cause of death is likely homicide, caused by a lethal cocktail of drugs administered by Jackson’s personal doctor, Conrad Murray.
Fact: The deceased have a history of staying dead in a nonfictional setting.
Taking these truths into account, there is little to no wiggle room to think that anyone could possibly believe that the recently departed King of Pop actually faked his death and was involved in elaborate hoax.
Right?
Wrong.
Unfortunately, there are about a million or so YouTube viewers who do not appear to subscribe to this theory, instead choosing to explore the possibility that Jackson is alive and well.
In a grainy video posted on Aug. 25, a man who bears an uncanny resemblance to Michael Jackson is seen jumping out of the back of an official-looking white van emblazoned with “Coroner” and into the rear entrance of a building the audience assumes is the actual coroner’s office.
The original copy has spawned countless iterations of the same footage, with detailed analyses both for and against the theory, rivaling the level of scrutiny given to the Zapruder film, the silent home video that is the most complete visual recording of the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy.
Alas, before the world reached full-scale pandemonium, a German news station came forward to claim responsibility for producing the clip, which was revealed as nothing more than a viral video aimed at dissuading the public from believing the many rumors seen in the media. And in case this disclosure wasn’t enough to put the kibosh on any feverish discussion among vigilant skeptics, the original video clip was revealed to have been posted by a user named “michaeljacksonhoax.”
But while viewers may never recoup the one minute spent watching the clip, the reaction to the video serves as both a valuable and interesting look into an unexpected area.
Among the throngs of comments left on the now-infamous hoax video are those who find the video an insult to the memory of Michael Jackson. Others, while less offended by the makers of the video, still feel that it’s much too soon to be toying with people’s emotions in this period of grieving.
Granted, it’s understandable why some would deem it too soon to even think that it would be acceptable to joke around about the possibility of a resurrection in light of the recency of Jackson’s death.
But along the same lines, when is it ever really OK to make passing comments about someone’s death? Is it any more tactful to make conspiracy theories about Princess Diana’s death now than it was a decade ago?
The answer is no. Anyone who would venture into the gray area to contend this notion need only to imagine themselves making snide comments in front of the friends and family of the deceased.
Clearly, the “too soon” argument is a moot point.
And as for those up in arms over the caricature-esque portrayal of Jackson in the video, anyone who’s stopped by the checkout aisle of Superior or Ralph’s recently knows that there’s far more salacious, and perhaps even fallacious, material headlining the supermarket tabloids.
What then is the real reason for all of the negative attention garnered by this amateurish Jackson sighting hoax?
The fact of the matter is, while there is much abuzz over the video, it’s not an ethical issue. The only reason this video has received such a rise is because the public let itself become upset.
Though the intention of the video was to shed light on the gullibility of the mass media audience, it appears to have instead shown that we’re a group of sore losers.
Would there have been nearly as strong a reaction, let alone viewings, had people dismissed the probability of the resurrection video?
Collectively, we should have had enough logic to ignore any inkling of belief that Jackson was still alive. Those who bought any part of the minute-long clip should very well be embarrassed.
Any negative reaction to the experiment is borne out of a bruised ego, not rational thought.
This is not a controversy.
This is a travesty.

This column is not for all readers. If you’ve ever purchased tampons that were designed to look like pieces of candy to save yourself from embarrassment, you might consider turning the page.
Similarly, if you insist on referring to your own menstruation or the menstruation of someone you know as “a visit from Aunt Flo,” you should probably do the crossword puzzle (seeing as you are so good at word play).
If you have heard that periods attract bears, or if Georgia O’Keefe makes you nervous or if you are still considering the possibility that vagina dentata might be more than an urban legend, then the sports section can be found on the last page.
This is not to say that this article is about to drift into a Eve Ensler-esque melodrama about my first period — my mom submitted a press release to the local news when I was 14, so most people have already heard about it.
I’m not really interested in celebrating vaginas anyway. Between Lindsay Lohan, the Vagina Monologues and low-rise pants, vaginas get so much attention, they’re practically mainstream.
It’s time to recognize a different tool of genitalia, one that has historically been disparaged: the uterus.
The uterus was first vilified by that quack Hippocrates, who theorized that when women hadn’t had sex, their uteri dried up and started wandering around the body, causing them to become neurotic.
This was a pretty useful explanation for ancient doctors, who got to tell confused family men: “No, she’s not crying because you sacrificed her cat to Dionysius — she just misplaced her uterus. Have sex with her; that will fix everything.”
The good news is that doctors don’t take anything Hippocrates said seriously anymore. The bad news is that the uterus suffered from unjust defamation for practically the rest of time.
The word “hysteria” comes from the Greek word for uterus (hystera, if you’re interested). And before we used it to describe what happened when someone thought they saw a UFO or Elvis, hysteria was a word that was used to describe just about every medical symptom ever associated with a woman.
By the time the Victorian era rolled around, women who crocheted an unusual pattern were said to be hysterical.
Finally, though, the uterus is going to get the respect it deserves. You’d think that this respect is a given, seeing as the uterus brings us all into the world, but now science is showing us what I’ve always suspected: The uterus is a hero.
A Ph.D. student in reproductive biology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland has found that the uterus can not only give life but also save it.
As it turns out, every month the uterus bleeds, which is a real lark. But then the uterus heals itself by repairing the tissue and clearing away the white blood cells that helped the healing process but which are harmful if they hang out for too long.
Scientists now think that if they can fully understand how this injury-and-repair process works, they can work out how to imitate it in other contexts with other body parts.
Finally, the organ that has been blamed for everything from not producing male heirs to the popularity of Titanic is being vindicated.
Yes, Hippocrates might have laughed at women who obsessively rewatched the “I’m flying, Jack!” scene in Titanic. But who’s hysterically laughing now, Hippocrates?

The same day a CNN public opinion poll announced that the president’s approval rating had dropped to 53 percent, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics held its first Students Talk Back forum of the semester, titled “Obama Overview: How’s he doing?”
At the forum, held in the EVK Common Room Wednesday, students and faculty gathered with experts from the 2008 Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns to discuss the Obama presidency.

“I think these forums and these debates are important so people can not only articulate their views, but strengthen them,” said Alexa Ekman, president of the USC College Republicans, who attended the event.
Students convened with expert panelists Craig Schirmer, a senior advisor of the Obama/Biden campaign, and Andrea Jones Rivera, the California state director of the McCain/Palin campaign. Student panelists Jon Carpenter, former president of the USC College Democrats, and Joseph Clark, a representative from the USC College Republicans, also presented their political views at the event.
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Daily Trojan Managing Editor Dan Loeterman, moderated the lunch panel discussion.
“Dan [Schnur] has an incredible ability to pull together people from across the political spectrum and help educate students on important issues to our country,” Rivera said.
The forum covered the full gamut of issues on the president’s agenda, from the economic stimulus to health care reform and even the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“The president has a lot of challenges ahead and he’s starting to meet them head-on,” Schirmer said during the forum.
Rivera said she thought President Obama needs to balance which issues he wants to make an impact on with the issues that he needs to make an impact on. Rivera added that she thought Obama should have stayed in the United States for longer than he did after the election to make some progress on his agenda, before choosing to go overseas.
“Obama has a larger-than-life personality, the likes of which we haven’t seen since JFK,” Rivera said.
On health care reform, Rivera said she thought Obama started out on the right foot by meeting with senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle, but that he did not set the right tone for the specific items he wanted to see accomplished.
The current backlash on health care reform is based on the
widespread view that the current administration has taken on too much, Rivera said.
Obama was elected on the promise of change, according to Clark, but instead the country found itself with a growing deficit and an expansion of government into banking and the auto industry.
Schirmer said it seemed Obama was starting the process of making changes.
“[Obama]’s beginning to lay down the markers of changing Washington,” he said.
He noted Obama expanded the national debt to prevent a full-fledged depression, and that health care reform seems to be close to fruition.
The president plans to address both houses of Congress next week with his specific goals for health care reform.
“He’s a guy that finds a way to get things done,” Schirmer said, adding that Obama will need to present a clear, compelling message to garner enough support to back the health care legislation.
Despite the global financial crisis, conservatives are willing to spend money for the war on terror, as long as there is a clear vision in the ongoing fight, according to republicans Rivera and Clark.
“President Obama is in a unique position in that he can reach out to other countries, especially in the Middle East,” Rivera said.
The president is working with Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who commands US and NATO troops in Afghanistan, to devise a new strategy for the next year in the country, Schirmer said, with the hopes that progress would be made before liberals become disenchanted with the war.
“The administration needs to bring political muscle this fall,” he said.
After the panel discussion concluded, both the students and experts in attendance said they thought the event was a good way to spark discussion about important political issues.
“The country is faced with great problems and it is always good to engage in political dialogue, no matter what your ideological perspective,” Schirmer said, following the forum.
Rivera agreed, noting that it is particularly important to have students involved in discussions like the Students Talk Back forum.
“This is the next generation of young leaders and it’s extremely important to help them get involved,” Rivera said. “It’s important to have a discussion about politics without throwing a table across the room.”
Schnur said he was pleased by the high student turnout, especially since it was the first panel of the semester.
“From the time we started these lunches last fall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised and tremendously encouraged by the level of student turnout and participation,” Schnur said. “The fact that we were able to start out today with such a strong turnout and such a valuable discussion bodes very well for the semester.”
The Students Talk Back forums will continue every Wednesday until the end of the semester. The next two forum topics are health care reform and Afghanistan.

URBNMRKT, pronounced urban market, named for its hip, urban atmosphere, is USC Hospitality’s newest addition to the university’s dining option and is now open for business.
Located at 3434 S. Grand Ave. in USC’s Grand Avenue Library, the dining facility held its grand opening Wednesday. URBNMRKT will serve fresh, made-to-order breakfast and lunch and will also include separate salad, sandwich and coffee bars for students on the run.

Though the location is not on campus, Executive Chef Thomas Moran said URBNMRKT is meant both for the employees who work in the neighborhood and for students
“We’re here to serve students,” Moran said. “There’s options for students who want lunch on-the-go, but also a nice area for them to sit down and eat.”
While students said they were interested in what URBNMRKT has to offer, many say they are put off by the long walk.
“I wouldn’t walk 15 minutes down Jefferson,” said Caitlin Mouton, a senior majoring in history. “Honestly, I feel The Lot has good things, and I feel the campus already has so many dining options we don’t even know about.”
Moran noted that the dining facility also offers a new option for USC employees.
“We own all the buildings in the area, and we also wanted to serve Facilities Management, so the location made sense,” Moran said.
The location, previously a loading dock, is one of URBNMRKT’s most distinguishing features. With actual loading docks and numbers worked into the décor and a photo of the old loading dock adorning the entrance, URBNMRKT embraces its warehouse past.
URBNMRKT, like a number of USC’s other dining facilities, will include to-go sandwiches and a soup of the day, but will also include options not available in other dining facilities, like salmon, wraps and a choice of veggies and fresh fruit during lunch. Also, it serves breakfast burritos, breakfast sandwiches, croissants and bagels during morning breakfast hours. It’s also a fully functioning tech center, with flat screen TVs, music and projection television during big games.
Kara Alter, a senior majoring in communication, likes the idea, but isn’t convinced.
New eatery
“I feel out of USC’s comfort zone,” she said. “They should put that place in the new commons because we need a breakfast place — a place that serves pancakes and other breakfast food.”
There have been a number of recent additions to USC dining facilities, including the opening of McKay’s, Rosso Oro’s Pizzeria and The Lab on Figueroa Street. Next on the menu is the renovation of residential dining hall Everybody’s Kitchen.
“I can’t wait to start on EVK,” Moran, who’s also the executive chef for the majority of USC’s dining facilities, said. “It should be fun.”
URBNMRKT’s current hours run from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., but they hope to extend their hours as they expand, offering dinner options as well as a full wine bar.

According to the USC Department of Public Safety, Tuesday’s death at the Radisson has been ruled a suicide.
The deceased has been identified as a 39-year-old white male, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said, but LAPD has not released the victim’s name, awaiting notification of next of kin.
The man fell from the seventh floor of the hotel and landed by the Radisson’s outdoor pool, Carlisle said.
Though the incident does not appear to have a connection to USC, Carlisle said authorities are still investigating to be sure.
The area by the Radisson pool was designated as a crime scene Tuesday, but the pool was open for use again today.
According to Mike Juliani, a freshman who lives in the Radisson, LAPD was investigating at the scene past midnight Wednesday morning and DPS officers were stationed at the end of student-occupied hallways to make sure students didn’t interfere with the investigation.
Sarah Benzel, another freshman resident of the Radisson, said that the caution tape was removed from the crime scene Wednesday morning.

Employees of Aramark Services, a USC subcontractor that provides custodial and janitorial employees on campus, demonstrated in front of Tommy Trojan Wednesday afternoon, ahead of a Friday deadline on contract negotiations.
Approximately 100 demonstrators, including students, faculty and other staff, joined together, insisting on affordable health care and a better contract for the employees.
Negotiations · Members of USC’s maintenance staff, along with faculty and student supporters, march down Trousdale Parkway Wednesday. As they marched, the demonstrators held signs and chanted their demands for better contract terms from their employer, Aramark. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The demonstrators marched down Trousdale Parkway wearing shirts that said “Justice for Janitors,” holding signs and chanting slogans to protest against what they see as unfair health care terms on Aramark’s proposed contract package.
They gathered in front of Tommy Trojan where Raphael Lieb, an internal organizer for the union, led the crowd in a number of chants and songs.
The demonstration was held in advance of a final round of negotiations between the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West ­— the union that represents the employees — and representatives from Aramark. The union has two days to complete negotiations with Aramark before it must present the contract offer to its members, as per the bargaining schedule agreed to by Aramark, according to Lieb.
David James, a professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, has followed and participated in the workers’ efforts for the past 12 years. He addressed the crowd gathered at Tommy Trojan.
“We all know the university treats students very well,” James said. “But there are other parts of our community the university hasn’t treated well, especially those who clean our bathrooms, classrooms and offices.”
James also spoke to the crowd about a successful janitors strike that took place at USC in 1997, when the workers were attempting to join the union.
After the march, the demonstrating employees took buses downtown to the SEIU-USWW headquarters, where negotiations were underway to resolve the situation.
Negotiations between Aramark and the union must conclude within two days. At that point, a contract will be presented to the members of the union. If it is voted down, the employees will have no contract and, according to Jose Jovel, a union member who chairs the negotiating committee, the employees will have to strike.
“We want to win health insurance benefits, good salaries for our fellow workers and families … We are asking to be treated fairly by Aramark management,” said Gloria Canada, one of the demonstrators. “If they say no we are going to strike.”
Many of the demonstrators said they had been working at the university for decades, and had enjoyed their time at USC, but were dismayed by the present situation.
Jovel, who has worked at USC for 33 years, said it was the good benefits available that initially brought him to the university.
“I was working for my family in hopes that if my kids came [to USC] they would benefit from me working here,” Jovel said. “[But now] we are fighting for health care we can pay for, and not have to choose between having health insurance and bringing food to the dinner table.”
Jovel added that he wants the two sides to find a resolution by Friday, ending in good terms.
“That is my hope. I don’t want this to end in a strike,” he said.
The previous contract ended in June and the parties have since been through eight rounds of negotiation, said Salvador Hernandez, an employee who also sits on the negotiating committee. The main point of contention for the employees is a change Aramark made to the health care clauses.
Aramark had initially increased the amount workers would be paying for their health insurance’s monthly copay from 7.25 percent in the previous contract to 25 percent, according to Hernandez. Subsequent negotiation brought the offer down to 12 percent, but many workers are still unhappy with the number.
“They want to increase our health insurance payment dramatically and we can’t pay that,” said Jose Ramirez, a night-shift worker who works on the floor crew. “We want to maintain it to what it is now, which is already high. We are not trying to make money and get rich, we want what’s fair.”
Many of the workers who participated in the demonstration said the health care changes will have an impact on their families.
“I’ve been working on the campus for 19 years and, like you can see, we love USC — this is part of my life,” Hernandez said. “We work everyday to clean and improve this campus, but at this time we are trying to get a full package. We know the general situation and in the country is bad, but our industry is very important, and we’re trying to get a fair [contract] package.”
Although USC is not directly involved with the negotiations, a number of the demonstrators said they believe the university could influence Aramark’s decisions.
“These are all workers here at USC, and USC does support the subcontracting policy,” said Elias Kohn, a student who joined the demonstration. “So even though it’s not USC directly who’s harming these workers, they’re taking part in the harm.”
Bert Riddick, who works on USC’s Information Technology Services staff, said the solution seemed simple to him.
“If the university stepped in and demanded that Aramark offer insurance, that would solve the problem very quickly,” he said.
James Grant, executive director for media relations at USC, wrote in an email that the university has not been involved with negotiations between Aramark and the union.
“The collective bargaining agreement being negotiated is between Aramark and the Union,” Grant wrote. “We appreciate that there may be differing views of the related issues, and look forward to a fair and balanced resolution.”
Aramark declined to comment for the story.
