As USC continues its ascent in the world of higher education, more students are competing for the same number of coveted spots. This year’s admission rate, 17.8 percent, is the lowest in USC’s 134-year history.
In the past several years, freshman admission has become far more selective. Last year, USC admitted 19.7 percent of applicants, the lowest at that time. Timothy Brunold, USC’s dean of admission, called the class of 2018 the most accomplished group of first-year students in university history.
“Our admission committee enjoyed getting to know the largest, most interesting group of students it has ever had the privilege of reading,” Brunold said in a press release.  “USC’s distinctive academic programs, incredible diversity, vibrant campus life, global perspective and location in the heart of Los Angeles make it a very attractive option for the best and brightest students, not just from across the U.S., but from around the world.”
This fall, USC received more than 51,800 applications from high school seniors competing for an estimated 2,750 places in this fall’s entering class. The university admitted 9,225 students hailing from all 50 U.S. states and 80 other countries.
This year, 26 percent of incoming freshman will study in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. The Marshall School of Business and USC’s arts schools (Architecture, Cinematic Arts, Dramatic Arts, Roski School of Fine Arts and Thornton School of Music) will host 21 and 14 percent of the incoming freshman, respectively.
Several incoming freshmen echoed Brunold’s statements, citing USC’s variety of strengths as their reason for enrolling. Joy Ofodu, an incoming freshman majoring in communication, said that USC offers a comprehensive experience for students.
“Prospective students and families are quickly realizing that USC is the total package: career preparation, a thriving social scene, excellent athletics, incredible faculty, gorgeous campus, good food and amazing alumni networking,” Ofodu said. “There are now Trojans planted in every area of the world, and all of them are proudly talking up the university.”
Exposure from college ranking websites such as US News and World Report might play a part in drawing more applicants, along with other extensive recruiting measures.
“I believe [USC] has good marketing strategies that highlight the academics, sports, Trojan family and other opportunities,” said Natalie MacKraz, an incoming freshman majoring in computer science. “The explanations of the advantages of the Trojan family are especially appealing.”
This year, the admissions committee organized more than 50 on- and off-campus events such as SCend Offs, receptions for incoming students and families. These human connections are what resonated with Zachary Guo, an incoming freshman majoring in computer science (games), when he was considering which college to attend.
“The most effective recruiting tactic for me was staying with a current student at Explore USC,” Guo said. “Being able to ask [my host] all the questions related to my major and life at USC.”
This year’s group of incoming students is also more ethnically diverse than in years past. Overall, 21 percent of the class of 2018 includes students from under represented minority populations, and 13 percent of students will be the first in their family to attend college. According to an annual report released by the Institute of International Education, USC has enrolled more international students than any other American college or university.
John Lazzeroni Jr., an incoming freshman double majoring in electrical engineering and choral music, thinks USC’s diverse student body is one of the university’s biggest assets.
“Everyone comes from a different place and the cultural diversity is outstanding,” said Lazzeroni, who is attending on an NROTC scholarship.  “USC has a phenomenal reputation internationally, and I see people ‘fighting on’ everywhere. Nationally it is highly esteemed in many programs, especially the Thornton School of Music, and locally I get a lot of ‘oohs’ and ‘ahs’ when I say I am going.”
 
What is the class composition of those entering as freshmen? It would be good to know that diversity included socio-economic. It would be good to take some of the criticism of other elite schools head on: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118747/ivy-league-schools-are-overrated-send-your-kids-elsewhere
What you didn’t state is the fact that USC has turned down so many SCions with 4.0+ GPAs in favor of keeping spots open for kids from China and other Asian countries. So why did USC keep the enrollment numbers down? My friends’ kids have been told to go elsewhere for their Freshman ans sophomore years. So they did and aren’t coming to USC.

Wallis Annenberg Hall, the new five-story, 88,000 square-foot building next to the Pertusati University Bookstore, will be open for the first day of classes on Aug. 25. With the help of over 3,000 donors, the building has been fully-funded through Annenberg’s current $150 million fundraising initiative. Approximately 80 percent of donations came from alumni, with the rest coming from parents, families, corporations and other organizations for a total cost of $59.3 million for the building.
Wall to Wallis · The “360 room” in the converged media center of Wallis Annenberg Hall features a media halo with multiple live feeds. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Inside, the building features 23 new classrooms, which will be used for various journalism, communication and public relations classes. It also has a 160-person auditorium, professional-quality broadcast and radio studios, two faculty neighborhoods and two open research neighborhoods, which are collaborative spaces designed to increase faculty interaction. According to Associate Dean of Operations James Vasquez, one of the most exciting features is the “360 room” in the converged media center, which has a 360-degree assignment desk with a media halo of digital screens above it providing a live stream of news across multiple platforms. A television studio within the newsroom will include anchor desks and a greenscreen, as well as broadcast-quality cameras for radio programming and potential use online.
One of the central features of the building is called the forum, described as, “a four-story atrium with skylight, open seating and media display tower,” which will serve as the lobby for the building. A new cafe will also be open to accommodate students during study hours. The former Annenberg building was serviced by the Annenberg coffee cart, but surveys conducted by the school found that students wanted a full-service café so they wouldn’t have to pack up in the middle of their work to go to Seeds or Trojan Grounds.
The old Annenberg building will still be used for classes, as well as faculty and administrative offices. The building, however, is also undergoing a process of phased innovation, with upgrades happening in several stages.
Junior print and digital journalism major Allison Bajet said that one of the things that she admires  most about the school is, “[The] Annenberg culture of trying to improve and upgrade as technology does,”
Though it will be open for the first day of classes, the official opening ceremony for Wallis Annenberg Hall is scheduled for Oct. 1.

Xinran Ji, a second-year electrical engineering graduate student known for his academic prowess and compassion for others, died on Thursday, July 24. He was 24.
Ji was a graduate of Zhejiang University in China and had already earned several academic honors and a scholarship for his electrical engineering work and designs. His interests also extended beyond engineering. He was an avid photographer, and friends remember him for his bright personality and his constant willingness to help.

“[Everyone] felt comfortable and encouraged to work with him,” said Ding Yi, who was one of Ji’s classmates, co-workers and best friends throughout their college years at Zhejiang.
The two excelled in their engineering studies, while also working for QSC, a student publication of Zhejiang University. Yi was a reporter and Ji a photographer, a seemingly perfect match, and one that brought out Ji’s best qualities. According to Yi, many regarded Ji as “a warm and careful guy.”
Ji’s passion for photography led to a position as an editor of QSC’s photography department, where he encouraged others to improve and excel. Ji was not an outspoken leader. Instead, he preferred to showcase his leadership qualities by motivating others.
An outpouring of admiration for Ji and support for his family was also apparent on Chinese social media in the days following Ji’s death. Many pointed out Ji’s constant warmth, whether he was attending a news event, learning how to use a single reflex camera or simply taking pictures with friends.
“You were always so kind to everyone, with a big smile,” recalled one poster on Baidu.com, a Chinese web services and social media website.
“R.I.P., the one who was always passionate about life,” read another message on Baidu.com.
The various posts expressed feelings of shock, disappointment and sadness at Ji’s death.
USC faculty and administration praised and mourned Ji as well.
“The tragic loss of this incredible young man is shocking and senseless,” Elizabeth Garrett, USC provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, said at a memorial held for Ji on Aug. 1. “Our academic community must remain strong and united as we mourn.”
A scholarship fund in honor of Ji’s memory has been established at USC and will be awarded annually to promising electrical engineering graduate students from China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.

The Trojan Family mourned the loss of famed Olympian, World War II veteran and USC alumnus Louis Zamperini, ‘40, on July 2 in Los Angeles after his battle with pneumonia. He was 97.
Unbroken · Louis Zamperini, Olympic athlete, World War II hero and USC Trojan speaks to students at a campus visit in March 2013. – Daily Trojan File Photo
“He recently faced the greatest challenge of his life with a life-threatening case of pneumonia,” Zamperini’s family said in a statement. “After a 40-day-long battle for his life, he peacefully passed away in the presence of his entire family, leaving behind a legacy that has touched so many lives. His indomitable courage and fighting spirit were never more apparent than in these last days.”
Zamperini is the focus of Angelina Jolie’s upcoming film, Unbroken, which chronicles the life of the former Olympian during his performance in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, as well as his experience as a prisoner of war during World War II. The film, based on Laura Hillenbrand’s award-winning biography “Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,” is set to hit theaters in December.
Long before Zamperini was a war hero, however, he was a Trojan. A year ago, Zamperini returned to his alma mater as part of the “5 Traits of a Trojan” speaker series, in which he spoke about the power of resilience throughout his life.
“Life is full of problems,” Zamperini said to students on March 13, 2013 in Bovard Auditorium. “Sometimes the problems are difficult, but you have to be resolute.”
Born in Torrance, California, Zamperini made his mark on campus in the 1930s as an athlete, competing in the 5,000 meter run. His track career ultimately led him to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where he made his notable eighth place finish.
“Louis Zamperini was one of the greatest Trojans of all time, as well as a true American hero,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said in a statement. “He was the embodiment of the USC motto, ‘Fight On.’ All of us in the Trojan Family have a deep appreciation for what he did for USC and for our country, and we mourn the passing of this American legend, this national treasure.”
After graduating from USC, he went on to serve in the United States Army Air Corps. On May 27, 1944,  Zamperini served as a bombardier in a rescue mission that would ultimately end in a crash landing into the Japanese-controlled waters of the Pacific Ocean. The crash left both him and his fellow crew members stranded at sea for 47 days. Zamperini was eventually captured and served nearly two and a half years as a Japanese prisoner of war. He was mistakenly declared dead by the U.S. military and his parents received his death certificate a year after his plane went down.
“Every morning I woke up and expected that this was the day,” Zamperini said of his P.O.W. experience. “This is the day they’re going to kill us.”
Zamperini’s service earned him numerous national accolades, including three Purple Hearts and a Prisoner of War Medal. Zamperini said he was able to survive the war by recounting the lessons of his former track coach.
“You have to take the bull by the horns and fight ‘til the finish,” Zamperini said.
Zamperini will be honored as the grand marshal of the 2015 Rose Parade.
Zamperini is survived by his son, Luke, and his daughter, Cynthia Garris.

The first thing senior international relations major Alice Lee found herself doing when she arrived in Uganda for her summer photojournalism project was outrun a bus. After flying to Uganda, Lee went to a bus park, paid for her bus and left to use the bathroom — something she soon regretted.
Say cheese · Alice Lee, center, poses with 31 Bits employees outside their office in Gulu, Uganda. Left to right: Grace, Florence, Betty, Jackie. – Photo courtesy of Alice Lee
 
When she emerged, the bus had left without her. So, she began to run. For two blocks she chased down the bus until it stopped.
“Half the people that saw me just stood there and laughed,” Lee said. “But some people were banging and trying to help me stop the bus.”
Lee caught her bus but in her rush she’d left her bags with all her belongings in the car that took her from the airport to the bus park. She started her trip with just one thing. Luckily, it happened to be the only thing that really mattered — her camera.
“Of course this would happen to me,” Lee said. “There’s no way I could start my time in Uganda any other way because this stuff just happens all the time.”
Lee’s foray into the world of photojournalism started because of the band Switchfoot and a photographer named Jeremy Cowart. When Lee was in middle school, Cowart shot promotional photos for Switchfoot, photos that inspired Lee to further investigate the photographer. She later discovered that Cowart had traveled to Africa and done a series of photo essays focusing particularly on East Africa.
“I was really drawn to those images and I think that’s what sparked my initial interest in photography — the combination of that and [Cowart’s] music photography,” Lee said.
Lee hopes to use her international relations major to do development work, possibly enabling her to have a more direct impact on improving the lives of people like those she profiled.
Though photography is not in her long-term career goals, Lee said it will always have a special place in her heart.
“I always tell people I think I have the best job because I get to just hang out with people and be their friends,” Lee said. “You can’t take honest, good pictures without establishing these relationships.”
Lee first traveled to Uganda last summer and worked as a photographer for 31 Bits — a social entrepreneurship organization that employs large numbers of women making paper bead jewelry in northern Uganda. This spring Lee studied abroad in Botswana, and rather than return home for the summer, she chose to continue her travels in Africa.
Lee wanted to document what she called “stories of change” about people she’d met during her travels. Initially she planned to travel to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania and profile one person from each country but she quickly realized that was overly ambitious.
“Within the first week I realized that I had these relationships with these people that I could communicate with — I knew a little bit of their local language, and I was familiar with the town,” Lee said. “The women that I worked with last year were all begging me to take their picture. I would have to overcome this barrier of being a stranger anywhere else.”
For her project Lee chose to profile four individuals who had been part of the Lord’s Resistance Army, a guerilla group that formed in violent opposition to the Ugandan government and operated in Uganda from 1986 to 2006. In 2006, a UNICEF-funded study estimated that at least 66,000 children and youth had been abducted by the LRA between 1986 and 2005. While some were able to escape, others were forced to be child soldiers or sex slaves. The group’s former leader, Joseph Kony, achieved notoriety in March 2012 when a documentary titled Kony 2012 detailing the group’s use of child soldiers was released.
When Lee first began the project, she was adamant that she didn’t want to discuss the topic of the LRA.
“I thought that [the LRA] was over-covered and especially people our age have heard about it a lot,” Lee said. “But through a couple connections to some local Ugandans who were trying to help me find people to interview [I found] really fascinating stories.”
Lee wanted the stories she told to be different. Instead of focusing on the LRA and the atrocities committed by its members, she decided to spotlight life after the LRA.
One man was abducted at age 10 and served as a child soldier for three years. He has been struggling for the past 10 years to get to university. Now at age 22 he is completing high school and hopes to earn a scholarship.
Lee’s second profile subject, Achama Jackson, served as a major and political official in the LRA. He joined in 1987. He was injured and in 1994 had his leg amputated. He later went on to serve 10 more years with the LRA. Though most former LRA officials are ostracized by their communities, Jackson built his own plantation of matoke, a staple plantain, and is now the community authority on matoke. He leads a village savings and loans association, through which he is able to support his two wives and 14 children. He now lives and farms on the same piece of land where his brother was murdered.
“Seeing his investment in his children was really cool for me,” Lee said. “Also seeing how open he was to sharing his experience because he was a major and he did do bad things but, because of how open he is and honest, he’s been accepted back into his community and people respect him — he’s a community leader.”
Another of Lee’s subjects, Abio Vicky, was abducted by the LRA at age nine. At age 14, she gave birth shortly before the fighters she was with launched a major offensive. Because she was not able to assist the men, Vicky and her baby were left behind and able to escape the LRA.
Today, Vicky is working at 31 Bits and is able to send both her daughters — one of whom was born after she returned from the LRA — to school.
“The reality is that there are really cool people doing really cool things, and I really believe that these are the people who can change this continent,” Lee said.
Lee said the project has given her unique insight into how northern Uganda, particularly the town of Gulu, has developed in the nearly nine years since the LRA has left the region.
“Everyone knows that the LRA was there but you could easily live there and not realize the impact or the effects of it,” she said.
Lee plans to create a book with photo essays about each of her subjects but remains unsure if she actually wants to publish the book. She does know, however, that she will not publish her photos on the internet.
“I’m still trying to figure out if a book would even be the best way or if I should just write these stories and send them back to the people they’re about,” Lee said.

The university is using the start of the semester to boost its efforts to address the issue of sexual assault on campus.
Many of the initiatives named in a March 25 email from Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry to students will be in full effect this fall. In addition, new provisions devised by administrators over the summer months will also be announced via an email from Provost Elizabeth Garrett shortly before classes begin.
“We’ve spent some time [this summer] attending national conferences, paying attention to legislation coming through our state legislators, as well as our White House Task Force report that also identifies best practices nationally,” Carry said. “We have been comparing what we provide with what’s going on nationally to identify best practices.”
The administration’s work this summer is just the latest part of the school’s long battle to combat both sexual assault on campus and allegations of the mishandling of sexual assault reports.
The complaint that started it all
In  May  2013, several students filed a group Title IX complaint, accusing the university of mishandling their reports of sexual assault. The U.S. Department of Education then deemed that three of those cases warranted further investigation and subsequently opened a probe.
With the complaint came a barrage of media attention on USC, as well as other colleges and universities that received similar complaints around the same time.
Scrutiny increased in October, when administrators admitted that they had underreported the number of sexual assaults to federal officials in their Clery Report, a report that documents three years of crime statistics for the university. Carry attributes the oversight to a mix up in accounting when combining the list of reports from the Dept. of Public Safety with the list from the Center for Women and Men, two places where students can report sexual assault. Moving forward, however, Carry said a process has been put in place to ensure this does not happen again.
“Now our process is in place to have ongoing reconciliation [of the lists],” Carry said. “In the Deptartment of Public Safety there’s a single officer assigned to this task of making sure that our records are up to date at all times.”
According to Carry, at the beginning of the spring semester, federal investigators came to campus to interview students and staff and further examine USC’s process for handling reports of sexual assault. USC is one of 55 colleges and universities nationwide under investigation. It takes anywhere from six to nine months for results of the investigation, in the form of recommendations for the school, to be announced, according to Carry.
Once the recommendations are issued, by the Office of Civil Rights, the university will work with the office to determine which should be instituted at USC and which might not work as well.
“The federal government also looks at public universities, community colleges, technical colleges, so they may deliver a recommendation that doesn’t make complete sense in our context,” Carry said. Other recommendations, though, he said would be “no brainers.”
Improving the system
Administrators have not been sitting idle as they wait for these recommendations to be passed down, however. The March memo to all students announced initiatives that had been developed by administrators, student leaders, the Dept. of Public Safety, the Title IX coordinator and the Center for Women and Men. One provision particularly influenced by students was the clarification of the reporting process Student leaders met with administrators of a six-month period, according to Carry, to help identify what parts of the process and the code of conduct were unclear.
“We had to focus on how to make this more apparent, how do we make this more clear so there’s no confusion about it, because I think the responsibility of clarity is to the writer,” Carry said.
Other changes were more quickly instituted. In September 2013, administrators hired a specially trained Title IX investigator to take over all interviews and investigations from Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, who had previously been handling sexual assault cases on top of cases of theft, conflict, plagiarism and more.
“This investigator only deals with sexual assault … so they get to identify patterns and themes and get to focus on learning from every interview process,” Carry said.
To further assist students who wish to report that they believe they’ve been sexually assaulted, the Center for Women and Men, one of the two places students can file reports and also a space for them to receive confidential counseling, will be moving to a space in the Engemann Student Health Center twice as large as their current one in October.
“Being in the health center is going to be really amazing because now we’re also part of a bigger clinical team,” said Ekta Kumar, director of the center. “There’s more researchers, there’s more clinicians to collaborate with.”
A new location is not the only recent change for the Center for Women and Men. Kumar is now hiring a larger staff. With its newly enhanced resources, Kumar is hoping the center can do more to assist these students.
“I think this year’s going to be really exciting,” Kumar said. “There’s a lot of transition happening, but our focus is to just really collaborate on the university-wide initiative and student-led initiatives.”
This includes working with the Title IX office on training for all first-year students in bystander education and interpersonal violence during Welcome Week, as well as further training three weeks later to check in on students and reinforce the message.
Within the center itself, Kumar has ambitious plans to revive programs that have fallen out of practice in recent years, including group therapy sessions and a men’s care program, in which a group of men come together to have dialogue on masculinity and relationships and put on events on campus.
“I think a lot of times people think of [sexual assault] as a women’s issue when in actuality it’s not, it’s a broader issue,” Kumar said. “We are trying to revamp that by getting more men involved in our office, too.”
In addition, the administration hopes that more students will now go to the Center for Women and Men or DPS for help because of the new medical amnesty policy, implemented in the spring, which ensures that those who seek help will not be punished for having consumed alcohol. First passed by the Undergraduate Student Government, the policy was also adopted by the administration and added to the growing list of responses to a poor history of sexual assault.
“That’s the best example of how the partnership works,” USG Vice President Rini Sampath said of the collaboration. “It’s all about passing these resolutions, getting into meetings where we get to talk to administrators and address these issues.”
Students take charge
Students have taken the lead on many projects to further sexual assault prevention. The Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils have formed an eight-person student-led task force to address issues of sexual assault.
“As a chapter president, I was noticing an alarming rate of girls coming forward and saying, ‘I heard something happened’ or ‘something happened to me,’” said Kaitlyn Hittelman, co-chair of the task force and president of Delta Delta Delta. “As the president, that’s absolutely unacceptable.”
Hittelman partnered with other chapter presidents, Greek senators and members of the two Greek life councils to address the issue. The task force has three goals: to educate the Greek community on what consent means, on bystander intervention and to create a culture change.
“Our biggest goals are a little intangible. … But I think we just want to bring it to the forefront of everyone’s minds and really make it clear to everyone — because I think it’s clear to the leadership — that this isn’t a men’s issue and this isn’t a women’s issue, it’s a rape issue,” Hittelman said.
This phrase seems to be the motto of the group as they attack this problem. Hittelman’s co-chair, Zeta Beta Tau president Micah Solit expressed the same sentiment and added one more distinction: the issue is also not Greek versus non-Greek.
“I really want to eliminate the perception that this only happens in fraternity houses because the reality is that’s not true.  Everybody knows that deep down,” Solit said.
Though the task force is instituting their program in the Greek system, the program could soon be expanded to other parts of the student body. USG Greek Senator Providence Ilsevich, a member of the task force, plans to introduce a bill to the USG Senate sometime this semester that would expand student-initiated sexual assault programming to other organizations.
“The concept behind [expanding the program] is that we would really like to see that this is something that our whole university can hold itself accountable for,” Ilsevich said. “You know, we say this is not a Greek issue, it’s not any individual group issue, it’s a nationwide issue and it’s a university-wide issue.”
Because the current task force is specifically tailored toward the Greek community, Ilsevich is working on formulating a program that could work for all organizations on campus and account for the fact that many students are in multiple organizations.
“There’s a lot of different restrictions that can possibly prevent this from working, and that’s something we’re really trying to plan around,” Ilsevich said. “We don’t want this to turn into something that’s unrealistic for every group and then it never happens at all.”
USG is also working on a social media campaign to open up dialogues about this sometimes taboo issue. Sampath believes that the campaign will work nicely with a resolution if it’s passed to address the issue.
“It’s kind of like the carrot and the stick model in that the carrot is that all your friends, your buddies, everyone you care about and your moral compass is telling you not to do this,” Sampath said. “But also, say, giving students consequences if we were to pass a resolution.”
With all these new programs in place, many will expect to see progress at USC. Both Carry and the student leaders, however, emphasized that positive results might not be what people expect.
“I am hoping that more students, men and women, feel empowered to report cases of sexual assault,” Carry said. “Our numbers may increase, and I will see that as a good result because I think part of the concern with regard to sexual assault on college campuses … has been the shame wrapped around reporting these crimes.”

Among the 80 construction projects taking place at USC this year, one of the most visible is the demolition of the University Village on the north side of campus.
Rising from the ashes· The USC Caruso Catholic center can be seen beyond the rubble of the old, demolished University Village. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The billion-dollar USC Village project began in the first week of June with the demolition and fencing of the area where the 1.2 million-square-foot development will be constructed. The renovated USC Village, which will include approximately 2,600 beds for student housing, a full-service grocery store and 100,000 square feet of additional retail space, is expected to be completed in fall 2017.
A total of nine buildings will be constructed as part of the new Village. Building one will serve as a utility building and central plant, which will house the cooling tower for the entire Village. Buildings two and three, which are intended to become future student housing units, will serve as temporary green spaces. Building four will become the Honors Residential College, which will house approximately 500 beds exclusively for freshmen honors students. Building five, at the corner of McClintock Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard, will be used as temporary green space to be set aside for future academic use. Buildings six, seven and eight will be constructed as student housing built over retail space. Building nine, the largest building, will house 700 beds, as well as the grocery store portion of the retail and underground parking.
Willy Marsh, the building project manager for USC’s Capital Construction Development, said the construction of The Village is on schedule, and that students can expect to see the beginning floors of structures as early as June 2015.
“By June of next year, building four will have four of its five levels completed,” Marsh said. “Building nine will be at about second level. Buildings six, seven and eight, the three other dorms , will have multiple levels on construction.”
Though three of the nine projected buildings will be used as temporary green spaces, they are intended to be constructed for future student housing and academic purposes. The dates for when these spaces will begin construction, however, is yet to be determined.
The ground floor of all of the dorm buildings will be dedicated to retail space. Though most of the marketing and leasing for the retail portion won’t take place until next fall, USC Real Estate and Management said in interviews that they are actively reaching out to potential tenants to fill the grocery store and drug store portions of The Village.
“We’re two to three years away from securing the retail,” Marsh said. “We know we have Bank of America and Starbucks already secured.”
According to USC Real Estate and Management, Bank of America and Starbucks were the only tenants from the previous village that had leases extending years beyond the groundbreaking date. As a result, both companies agreed to lease space in the new development as part of negotiations to have them vacate the old village for construction.
The demolition of the previous UV displaced many local businesses, including Superior Grocers, Quik-Pix Photo & Digital Lab and 21 Choices Frozen Yogurt. USC Real Estate & Asset Management, however, told the Daily Trojan that they are in communication with the displaced business owners who may wish to return to the newly renovated village.
“Most smaller businesses simply aren’t looking three years out,” Melissa Schild, the executive director of land use and planning for USC Real Estate and Asset Management, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “With respect to the businesses that were at the old project, there are a few that have expressed interest, and we would look to talk to them next year, to the extent they are still interested at that time and are a good fit within the merchandising mix for the new project.”
Though the UV has historically been a public resource to the surrounding community, the newly renovated Village will be under tighter security.
“We’ve designed this as an expansion of the existing campus, so all rules will apply to The Village as they apply on campus,” Marsh said. “We’ve designed it so we can have a controlled perimeter when needed and open during business hours, just like campus is now.”
Current security measures stipulate that the University Park Campus is only open to the public between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Students, staff and registered guests entering campus after 9 p.m. are required to show campus identification upon entering.
Though these same security measures will apply to the new USC Village, community members will have access to certain businesses after hours.
“The way we’ve designed it is that a few of the retail businesses — mostly the ones on the perimeter with street fronts — will have after-hours access, and the grocery store will have after-hours access as well,” Marsh said. “Anything inside of the village around the plaza will have limited hours.”
During the next three years of construction, sidewalk access to The Village will be off-limits to the public. As such, pedestrians will be confined to the east side of Hoover Street, the south side of Jefferson Boulevard and the west side of McClintock Avenue.
“Safety is going to be a really big deal and we need students to help us be aware of their surroundings and pay attention for construction vehicles,” Marsh said. “We want to make sure that the public thinks about safety — not only for them, but for the workers.”
The formal groundbreaking of The Village will take place on Sept. 15.

When police officers found Xinran Ji, a 24-year-old student, dead at his home in City Park Apartments last month, it was the third high-profile violent incident to occur on or around the University Park Campus in fewer than three years.
On guard · Following the murder of graduate student Xinran Ji, the university has extended deployment of private security ambassadors so that their numbers remain constant throughout the year. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Ji, a second-year graduate student studying electrical engineering, had been studying the night before. Ji was walking home in the early morning, at 12:45 a.m., when police believe he was attacked with a baseball bat during an attempted robbery. After the assault, the international student from China staggered back to his apartment, where he was later discovered by his roommate.
Following two high-profile incidents in 2012 — the off-campus slaying of two Chinese students in April and a non-fatal on-campus shooting in October of that year — the incident has recast a spotlight on USC’s safety program.
In the weeks following the assault, an online petition calling for more security year-round, as well stricter monitoring of the cameras installed around University Park campus, had received more than 1,700 signatures.
The incident left the school’s Chinese community, still recovering from the losses of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, who were murdered in 2012 while sitting in a car off-campus, particularly on edge.
In response, USC announced several new security measures on Aug. 8 geared toward educating international students on safety procedures and reconciling differences in security during school year and during the summer, when fewer students are on or around campus.
“It’s an ongoing process for safety measurements like that,” said Yuanzi Xie, a public administration graduate student who helped set up the petition. “But it is good to see the quick response from [the Dept. of Public Safety] and the university.”
Because emergency calls slow down in the summer, DPS has not contracted additional off-campus security in the past, as it does during the school year, said DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle.
“That has already changed,” he said.
Other changes include an increase in nighttime patrols, enhanced analytics for video camera monitoring, the speeding up of the rollout of a mobile safety app and the expansion of Campus Cruiser coverage, which will bring wait times to 15 minutes or less.
Undergraduate Student Government President Andrew Menard said he believes security was not adequate at the time of the incident. Menard has spent two summers at USC and feels that security during the break should be the same as during the school year.
“For the most part, in the summer, people have felt safe,” Menard said. “When something like this happens, it just goes to show that you never can predict what’s going to happen. And you always have to be ready and you can never get complacent.”
According to Jeff Zisner, head of Los Angeles-based firm AEGIS Security & Investigations, it’s not uncommon for security to reduce its operations based on circumstantial considerations, such as time of day or year.
“[For] every business that uses security, their daytime security team is going to be significantly larger than their nighttime security team,” Zisner said.
He noted that USC’s public safety program is “relatively robust” and said it could best be improved through greater awareness and education.
As part of the upgrades USC announced in early August, the university is in fact doubling down on safety training for students. Beginning this fall, the university will require “extended safety education” for its nearly 8,000 international students — 40 percent of which are Chinese.
Xu Yuan, a graduate student and president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, said the training presents an opportunity to address cultural differences between the United States and China. For instance, he said Chinese students might come to the United States with the false expectation that urban cities are safe late at night.
“Chinese students don’t know,” he said. “It’s a different culture.”
By 2015, the university plans to mandate continuing safety education for all students.
“We have more students and citizens than we have police,” Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said in an interview. “We really want to build a culture of bystander responsibility and shared responsibility.”
He stressed the importance of reporting even minor incidents, noting that the data improves DPS’s ability to make strategic choices about where to deploy its resources.
USC’s action is not the first occasion on which the security has increased on or around the university following a high-profile violent crime. After the murders of Qu and Wu, LAPD added 30 police officers and a detective to the division that includes USC. The university also added security cameras and expanded its area of coverage. In November 2012, following a non-fatal shooting outside an on-campus Halloween party, the university restricted access to campus after 9 p.m.
The enhancements have been effective in reducing crime, Carry said, pointing to a fence along the campus perimeter that has significantly decreased bike theft. Carry said the university must balance new measures with the effect on student life, but that public safety considerations typically outweigh such costs.
“There are some random things that are going to happen that we can’t prevent and can’t predict,” he said. “But I think our conversation about balance is always trumped with [whether new security] will help save a student’s life.”
Some continue to worry, however, that even with the upgrades, USC is sending the wrong impression about safety in the university’s surrounding areas. The parents of Qu and Wu, who filed a wrongful death suit that was later dismissed in court, have urged their government to issue a safety warning to Chinese parents, the Los Angeles Times reported.
“USC needs to be truthful to the reality that the surrounding area is just not safe,” Daniel Deng, a lawyer serving as a voluntary spokesman for the parents, told the L.A. Times after the new measures were announced.
Deng did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Despite the high-profile incidents, DPS reports that crime on campus is trending down.
“We feel our security measures were a significant factor in that decline,” Carlisle said in an email. “But the decline is completely overshadowed by the loss of our student.”
Xie, who helped create the petition, said he was more concerned about the university’s emotional response to Ji’s passing than any discussion about security. About USC’s memorial for Ji, he said the verbal translation from English to Chinese was “unprofessional” and riddled with mistakes that included the pronunciation of Ji’s name.
“We have communicated to the family our deep regrets for the translation,” Carry said. “The challenge with the entire scenario was people were working under extreme conditions during those days.”
Since the family was available for only two days, he said much of the service had to be planned in one day. Carry also said that the translator did not receive an advance copy of the memorial speeches and had to translate on the spot.
“I think those who were disappointed by the delivery are well within their rights,” he said. “If I were sitting in their seat, I would have a similar reaction to that.”
The most recent security measures came from discussions with law enforcement, parents, alumni and Chinese student organizations.
“We looked at everything that we had in place and said, ‘How do we enhance it, how do we take it to the next level?’ That was our primary evaluation,” Carry said.
Yuan, the president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, met twice with administrators before the improvements were announced. He said he felt officials genuinely wanted to hear from students. Still, he warned that it’s too soon to determine whether the new security upgrades will work.
“Time will tell whether the campus is safer or not,” Yuan said.
Brutal truth is particularly hard to take when a loved one is lost like this, but the reality is that the University is not responsible for Ji’s death.  Nor was USC responsible for the death of the couple in their car previously.  USC can and should do all it can reasonably to keep its students safe, particularly on USC property… But this is an important legal distinction.  The presence of crime in the neighborhood surrounding the University has never been a secret.  Students, faculty and visitors need to employ the same sort of common sense and awareness that year-round residents of the neighborhood use to survive every day!
I am particularly disappointed to hear so much being made of “translation” issues at Ji’s memorial.  The memorial for Ji was a lovely gesture on the part of USC, and others who organized it so rapidly. Is it not reasonable to expect some translation issues when you’re studying abroad?  I can’t imagine expecting perfect English if I were in a foreign country.
My heart cries for Ji’s family and his friends, but we can’t let the sadness of this tragedy cloud our judgment.  We should welcome USC’s enhanced security measures, and put pressure on the LAPD and DA’s office to find and prosecute those truly responsible.
President Nikias has yet to make a public statement about Xinran’s death – i guess a USC getting beaten to death is not important enough to interrupt his summer vacation. Nikias had the Office of the Provost fill in for him on this incident

In a sea of Bed, Bath & Beyond foldable laundry baskets and plastic Ikea storage containers, it can be hard to differentiate one dorm room from another. As the year starts to pick up and late nights in Leavey become more commonplace, it becomes more and more difficult to find time to properly decorate your dorm in a way that’s unique and entirely you. Especially as a freshman trying to find time to orient oneself in new surroundings, it can seem particularly daunting. Though having countless collages on our wall with photos from home is an easy way to decorate any space, USC’s location in Los Angeles provides a variety of exciting opportunities to customize and personalize your home for the next year — all while exploring one of the greatest cities in the United States.
The Melrose Trading Post, also known as the Fairfax Flea, has been a mainstay for Angelenos and tourists alike for more than 20 years. Every Sunday, antique and vintage dealers stock their booths with clothing, furniture, knickknacks and other odds and ends. Entrance to the market costs $3, and once you’re inside it’s easy to understand why the Flea is such a must-see. A couple hours perusing the aisles of the marketplace (Fairfax High School’s converted parking lot),and you’re bound to pick up a handmade trinket or graphic print to hang up on a dorm wall. If you get hungry, the makeshift food court houses several vendors offering everything from the perfect street taco to a refreshing Brazilian salad to Nutella crepes. The only problem with the Fairfax Flea is that it’s small, which leads us to our second option.
Generally regarded as the much bigger sister to the Fairfax Flea, the Rose Bowl Flea Market takes place the second Sunday of every month and packs in almost 20,000 buyers from all over California. Located in Pasadena, the market has over 2,500 booths to choose from; it would be wise to dedicate an entire Sunday to perusing the place — and even then, it’s almost impossible to get through. With such a collection, saving money can be difficult while walking among the rows of vintage cameras, antique tea cups and old picture frames, so be prepared to say goodbye to a lot of amazing pieces (but also hello to a few things you’d never expect). Coming prepared with a list of general items you want is necessary to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Like the Fairfax Flea, the Rose Bowl also offers dining options . Bring $8 for the entrance fee, plenty of sunscreen and a bottle of water — Los Angeles is very sunny, but Pasadena feels even sunnier.
If outside markets don’t sound fun, thrift stores are another option for decorating your space affordably and uniquely. While it’s great for deadstock garments from the nearby fashion district downtown, the Goodwill near USC doesn’t offer much in the furniture or décor department. The Vine Goodwill (1218 Vine St.) and Out of the Closet (6210 Sunset Blvd.) are better options for dorm-enhancing items. The prime location of both of these thrift shops means they get the leftovers from both classic Old Hollywood estates and new starlets’ closets. Of course, every thrift store is hit or miss depending on the day, so regular outings to a few of these throughout the fall is necessary. Whether it’s a vintage 1970s owl print to hang up on the wall above your desk or a quirky set of ceramic figurines, thrift stores always have an amazing array of options, and you never know what you’ll bring back to campus. Once you’re done shopping at either of these locations, you can walk a few blocks (or bus it) to the nearby Amoeba Records for a few CDs or to the Arclight Cinema for this month’s latest blockbuster. If you’re looking for a meal, there are plenty of dining options in the surrounding areas — Umami Burger, anyone?
And if all else fails, you can just head over to Urban Outfitters in the Space 15 Twenty complex to pick up a couple trendy scented candles or wall decals to outfit your dorm in your own personal (albeit mass-produced) way. Hey, at least it’s not the same old Bed, Bath & Beyond, right?

Unlike in other stories of garage successes and Harvard dropouts, Kadie and Flynn didn’t need to leave USC to pursue their dream of producing their short film “Blackroot.” Rather, late night dorm room discussions and the atmosphere of the B.F.A. in Film and TV Production program have helped them create “Blackroot,” a short film set in 1967 that portrays a transgender Native American teen’s meeting with white hippie hopefuls in the woodlands of Washington.
Neither student is a stranger to the challenges of taking on a larger scale production like “Blackroot,” which was released on Vimeo Sept. 3.
Kadie won Best Youth Filmmaker at the Seattle International Film Festival in fourth grade,  and Flynn has created a number of shorts in collaboration with New York University student Sam Wolff, including a promotion for the online “Emma Magazine.”
Despite their experience, Kadie and Flynn described the production of “Blackroot” as a crazy ride, from its inception during last falls semester as new roommates, to Skype auditions with potential actors, to five days of shooting in the Seattle area in December. The pair jump started the project by raising over $2,600 using popular crowdfunding website Indiegogo and a catchy, bright, well-produced pitch video that provided funders a taste of the work to come.
Paired by a housing questionnaire prior to their freshman year, Kadie and Flynn’s easy rapport is apparent in both the pitch video and in person.
“I googled Ben as soon as he messaged me about being roommates,” said Flynn, who mentioned he always planned on using their rooming situation to foster collaborative projects.
Often building off the other’s ideas and finishing each other’s sentences, the two seem to work seamlessly together.
“Jack’s really good about giving constructive, harsh criticism,” Kadie said.
Inspiration for “Blackroot” came from Kadie’s idea of a film set in 1967 and Flynn’s desire to represent queer characters in an honest way.
Most queer films follow similar patterns, according to Flynn.
“Once you come out everyone gives you a group hug and you go back to singing in your school’s glee club,” he said.
“Blackroot” is an attempt to avoid the tropes that often accompany period pieces detailing the hippie movement, transgender characters and Native American characters, a lofty goal for students with little experience dealing with these delicate topics. For help with accurate representation, Flynn and Kadie reached out to USC English professor and Native American scholar David Treuer.
“He gave us really honest criticism, both as a scholar and just as a storyteller,” Kadie said.
The lead actor is portrayed by a member of the Red Eagle Soaring Native Youth Theatre in Seattle. Cast members were also able to provide personal perspectives to their characters and often did, according to Flynn.
Lois Landgrebe, who plays protagonist RT’s grandmother in the film, is a Tulalip storyteller and works to preserve the native language. She added gestures and language to her role that were not scripted, bringing integrity to the storytelling.
Many aspects of the film were collaborative, bringing outside expertise to the process. Wolff, Flynn’s high school collaborator, served as the lead cinematographer, while the third producer, Tyler Brown, is Kadie’s high school friend and a University of Washington student.
“Blackroot” also benefits from an original score by Boston University graduate Dan MacDonald, the creative energy behind ‘60s folk revivalist project Spitzer Space Telescope. Flynn stumbled upon his music online, and found it to be the perfect complement to the feel  of “Blackroot.”
Kadie described a scene using MacDonald’s music in which all the characters are under the influence of mushrooms, and in the background is a “twangy, plucky, psychedelic, bizarre” song that sets the scene perfectly.
“He was awesome to work with,” Kadie said.
Though MacDonald has experience writing songs for independent films, this is his first film score. He said a lot of the music was inspired by the constraints of time and budget, using old song ideas that fit the film’s tone, recording with a single microphone and mixing and mastering through a friend.
“In the end, these parameters gave the final score a very intimate feel with natural sounds, which I think brings a very human quality to the film,” MacDonald said. “The film is really strong and I’m excited to see how it does on the film fest circuit.”
Flynn and Kadie said they gained greater insight into the comprehensive aspects of filmmaking from the experience, from locating a period car for hire, to obtaining filming permits, to using Google Street View to scout locations from afar.
As the whirlwind of creating “Blackroot” comes to an end for the pair, Kadie and Flynn are already looking to the future. Kadie has spent the summer as an intern for di Bonaventura Pictures, producers of films such as the Transformers series, Salt and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. He also works as a freelance effects artist and crew member in his spare time.
Flynn spent half his summer weeks working as a narrative designer at the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts in the World Building Media Lab, home to the interactive multimedia Leviathan project. He spent the rest of his time as an intern at Material Pictures, Tobey Maguire’s production company.
The pair is also working on individual projects for the upcoming year, and though they have no immediate plans for future collaborations, they are definitely not ruling out the possibility.
 
Editor’s note: this post was updated to state that the lead actor came from the Red Eagle Soaring Youth Theatre.

Middle Eastern herdsmen, Midwestern Amish farmers and California Whole Foods shoppers don’t seem like they’d have much in common. All three groups, however, impacted the creation and success of Desert Farms, a camel milk company founded by Walid Abdul-Wahab, who graduated from USC in 2013.
Initially, the idea for a  camel milk company was just a class project for Abdul-Wahab, but the idea earned him USC’s Marcia Israel Award, which motivated him to take the idea further.
Abdul-Wahab first drank camel milk while visiting family in Saudi Arabia last year though.
He admits he was skeptical at first, but Abdul-Wahab eventually became a believer.
“It quenched my thirst and worked as a meal replacement. It is such a whole, powerful food and I kept learning about it and researching it online,” Abdul-Wahab said.
After he returned to the United States, Abdul-Wahab began the  process of launching his company. He spent fall of 2013 researching camel farmers and working on his idea, and he officially founded Desert Farms in January 2014. The eight-month-old company now sells products in roughly 50 California Whole Foods stores.
Before starting Desert Farms, Abdul-Wahab worked for a real estate firm but  desired a job he was more passionate about. His passions for both health and his home country of Saudi Arabia inspired him to create Desert Farms.
One of Abdul-Wahab’s hopes for Desert Farms is giving his homeland, the Middle East, a more positive reputation.
“With all of the negative vibes everyone’s getting from the Middle East, I wanted to bring in something positive,” Abdul-Wahab said.
As an avid crossfitter and follower of the Paleo diet, Abdul-Wahab places a high emphasis on health. He was intrigued by the fact that Middle Eastern camel herders often survive almost solely on camel milk while taking their camels on long-distance journeys.
“If you can survive in the desert, you can survive anywhere else,” Abdul-Wahab said. “Camel milk feels to me like the ultimate dairy beverage.”
Judging by its nutritional facts, camel milk could very well live up to Abdul-Wahab’s praise of the drink. Camel milk contains 50 percent less fat than cow’s milk, and also provides 10 percent of the recommended daily protein intake. Whole camel’s milk contains approximately 110 calories, compared to 150 for whole cow’s milk.
Prior to Desert Farms’ founding, camel milk was already known for its health benefits. Research from King Saud University in Saudi Arabia demonstrated possible benefits of camel milk for autistic children. For this reason, a large portion of Desert Farms’ regular customers include parents of autistic children.
Desert Farms aims to spark a “camel milk revolution,” which could be difficult considering that cows currently outnumber camels by approximately 18,000 to one. One of Abdul-Wahab’s biggest challenges was simply locating camel farmers in the United States.
Though some people assume all camel milk in the United States is imported, it was important to Abdul-Wahab that his product was made in the USA. He spent the fall of 2013 touring Amish farms and “visiting every single farm to make sure they had a clean operation and everything was up to par.”
On the website, consumers can view detailed information about each of Desert Farms’ camel farms through an interactive map. Most farms are located in the Midwest and are family-owned by Amish families.
Providing this information to consumers is significant to Abdul-Wahab.
“[Desert Farms] wants to give full disclosure, so we tell consumers exactly who is milking the camels, what their background is in and what their practices are,” Abdul-Wahab said.
Desert Farms’ camels are grass-fed, with non-GMO feed. The camel milk contains no added hormones and is non-homogenized.
Sustainability definitely plays a large role in the company’s decisions and Desert Farms aims for it in every aspect of the production process, from energy efficiency to packaging.
Desert Farms’ website explains, “It’s essential to work alongside our farmers to reduce where possible. From water and energy efficiency, to reduced waste production and recycling, all of which translate directly to our carbon footprint.”
Abdul-Wahab intends to get his product “into 150 California stores by the end of this year, before expanding into other states.”
It’s obvious that Abdul-Wahab loves his camel milk and wants to share his “ultimate dairy beverage” with as many people as possible. Looking long-term, he hopes the company will be acquired by a large beverage company in order to make camel milk more available to consumers across the United States.
But those who don’t currently live near a store that offers camel milk can order the product online.
“The day you place an order, we’ll milk a camel for you and ship it the same day,” Abdul-Wahab said.
And in Desert Farms’ usual detail-orientated style, customers who order milk online even receive the name of the camel who produced their milk.
For Desert Farms, the “next big thing” was clearly inspired by old roots: from small local farms to Middle Eastern camel herders.

If pot smoking were a sport, few would disagree that Wiz Khalifa would be its Michael Jordan. With the exception of perhaps Snoop Dogg, no single rapper has been more outspoken about his illicit herbaceous forays than the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-representing rapper of 2011’s No. 1 hit “Black and Yellow.” But Khalifa has struggled to regain his form following 2011’s Rolling Papers. His 2012 album O.N.I.F.C. was a critical disappointment, and solo success for the husband of model Amber Rose is becoming increasingly rare.
Dazed and confused · Pittsburgh-based rapper Wiz Khalifa’s sixth studio album suffers from lackluster production and weak lyrics. – Photo courrtesy of Atlantic Records
Hip hop has been trending out of favor with the mainstream, and the overall commercial landscape for pop rap (the kind of music one would expect from a Wiz Khalifa studio effort) has become much less forgiving. That said, there’s much more riding on the success of his latest studio album, Blacc Hollywood, than Wiz Khalifa would perhaps like to admit.
If Blacc Hollywood was supposed to be the album to revive Wiz Khalifa’s career and launch the rapper back into hip hop relevance, listeners might as well break out the coffin and nails right now. The rapper’s sixth studio album is a departure from his previous work in the worst way: it lacks the cocksure edge of his mixtape efforts “Kush & OJ” or 2012’s “Taylor Allderdice” and the pop-friendly sensibilities of Rolling Papers. Instead, Blacc Hollywood is a mediocre plate of half-baked musical decisions.
Blacc Hollywood opens up with Khalifa rapping familiar misogynistic tropes on the hook of “Hope” featuring Ty Dolla $ign. He raps “Hope you got thousands in your pocket ‘cause she ain’t lookin’ for love / Hope you pop a lot of bottles ‘cause she ain’t lookin’ for love.” Khalifa better hope his listeners aren’t looking for much else in his lyrics, either, because barring any of the countless references to marijuana, the lyrics in Blacc Hollywood, for the most part, were just summarized in those two lines. The rapper squanders an otherwise banging beat of icy synths and a gritty bassline to remind his listeners that “Money, clothes and drugs, that’s what b-tches love.”
Things don’t improve much on the album’s first single, “We Dem Boyz,” which takes a trap-inspired beat that would have sounded outdated last year and finds Khalifa in 50 Cent nursery rhyme territory, rhyming the words “bottle,” “swallow,” “follow,” and telling us that he’s “smoking weed in [his] Mercedes” and that “these n—as broke, these n—as lazy,” which is funny only because Khalifa’s lyrics on “We Dem Boyz” sound uninspired to the point that they fail to operate even as self-parody.
The album’s sole highlight unfortunately doesn’t involve Khalifa at all. The track “KK” featuring Project Pat & Juicy J takes drug dealing in hip hop to a meta-level when Khalifa advertises his own personal strain of marijuana, “Khalifa Kush,” but it’s the reunion of brothers Juicy J and Project Pat that makes the track. Project Pat’s syncopated rhymes skitter confidently over the Jim Jonsin-produced banger and Juicy J’s smooth, languid flow sounds more comfortable rapping about Khalifa Kush than Khalifa himself.
“A– Drop” deserves mention if only for its completely puzzling progression. The track opens as a genuine club smash — a staccato of pitched vocal samples create a strangely sinister melody while rapid-fire tongue clicks punctuate a thundering, relentless bass line. Relative to his lackluster effort on the rest of the album, Khalifa sounds almost preternaturally confident, his rapid-fire delivery sounding just at home on what’s sure to be an absolutely banging album highlight. And then, the inexplicable happens — the hook mellows out into warm, dream-like synths that you would expect to hear on an opening theme for an ‘80s daytime soap opera. Khalifa insists on appreciating the female anatomy despite the marked tonal shift, rapping “Made me get a couple bands, drop it down on it.” The effect is absolutely jaw-dropping in all of the wrong ways. The track vacillates between “ferocious nod-inducing club banger” and “the opening theme from The Guiding Light c. 1986” one more time to let us all know that this isn’t a test — Wiz Khalifa, his producers and whoever green lights these solo projects at Atlantic Records have all collectively lost their minds.
Two years ago in the fall elections of 2012, Colorado and Washington state voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, but the decriminalization of marijuana made it lose some of its edge and appeal. After a foray into the mainstream, Wiz Khalifa is struggling to recapture novelty in a musical genre that was tailor-made for those who go against the grain. So as the illicit allure of marijuana begins to weaken, so too, it seems, does the brash bravado and the surprisingly paper-thin swagger of the genre’s chief marijuana consumer. Kurt Cobain once wrote (quoting Neil Young) that “it’s better to burn out than to fade away.” Whether it’s for better or for worse on Blacc Hollywood, Wiz Khalifa begs to differ.
Wiz has some dope work on Spotify, but this album isn’t doin it for me… 
I hate the singing sh#t…
just listened to blacc hollywood (delux) on spotify..
I just want the old wiz back– this new sh#t sounds as hardcore as limp bizkit.
I’m not sure we listened to the same album.  Literally I could not disagree more with this review.  Sounds like a case of hater syndrome.  Maybe I’m wrong and if this is legitimately your opinion I’ll respect it.  But damn, I’m surprised with this review. 
obviously you’re some 40 year old loser. our generation will run you at one point and guess what marijuana will be legal and medically enhanced. look what we’ve accomplished in the last 10 years not talking marijuana but technology, medicine, etc. btw…. WE DEM BOYZ has 35 million views on youtube. figure it out.
This article is trash  and a waste of time to fully read !
Your not only the biggest hater I’ve seen on Wiz but the biggest hater just in general reading only this article. You sure did alot of research on facts of his career to make sure your opinion hated to the next level in precision. With the talent you produce on hating, it sure is disappointing to see that talent go wasted.

After achieving sweeping success with the hit television show Mad Men, director and writer Matthew Weiner makes his feature film debut with Are You Here starring Owen Wilson,  Zach Galifianakis and Amy Poehler. The drama/comedy serves as Weiner’s contribution to the modern man-child genre. Are You Here delves into the darker side of the charmingly idiotic male protagonists we’ve come to know and love in films like Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Hangover however, Weiner focuses on their self-destructive behaviors and shows how the man-child is capable of growing up.

Owen Wilson plays Steve Dallas, a local weatherman who, though charming and affable, has fallen into a routine of womanizing, drinking and drug use that serves to push away any meaningful connections he has with the people in his life. His only friend is the eccentric and bipolar Ben Baker (Galifianakis) who spends his days in a trailer park collecting conspiracy theories. While seemingly unstable, Ben and Steve share in a comfortable, albeit unconventional bromance.
When Ben’s father dies, Ben enlists Steve to join him on a road trip to his hometown deep in Pennsylvania’s Amish country where his father’s estate is to be divided. Ben and his overbearing sister Terri (Poehler) are surprised to find that Ben is left with 100 acres of land and a small fortune that he is less than equipped to handle. Steve sticks around in hopes of acquiring some of his friend’s new property and moving in on Ben’s newly widowed 25-year-old stepmother Angelina, played by the stunning Laura Ramsey.
Weiner has been working on Are You Here since before Mad Men premiered in 2007. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Weiner remarked that the major theme of the film is that “Owen’s character has to get off drugs, and Zach’s character has to get on them.” Weiner’s impetus for writing began during a time in his life where he realized that he had very few male friends in his adult life and wanted to explore the meaning of friendship in a contemporary and realistic way.
Weiner told Vanity Fair regarding his inspiration that, “friendship is a lot rarer than love because there’s nothing in it for anybody.” This theme echoes throughout the story in every relationship and is the essence of Steve Dallas.
The dramatic nature of the film provides an interesting vehicle for its comedic actors to prove they are capable of distancing themselves from their comedic backgrounds. Most notably, Amy Poehler’s performance is a huge leap from her role as the quirky and charismatic Leslie Knope on NBC’s Parks and Recreation. Poehler gives a multifaceted portrayal of Terri Baker, an aggressive and bitter woman who spends much of the film struggling to understand her father’s decision to leave almost everything to her mentally unfit brother.
Galifianakis also shows a surprising amount of dramatic range as the neurotic Ben Baker.
Owen Wilson shines as the jaded protagonist, Steve. Weiner wanted to cast Wilson in the role since writing the script 10 years ago. Weiner told Vanity Fair he was drawn to Wilson’s ease and “unexpected wit.” Wilson’s charismatic portrayal of his character anchors the film and keeps the story centered on friendship and adulthood when it begins to veer into heightened complications and moments of confusion later on in the story. Wilson’s ability to swing from a one-note pothead womanizer to a vulnerable and complex character is seamless, with the perfect balance of humor and tragedy.
The decisions Weiner makes throughout the film add to an almost sugar-coated finish. In addition, the score and visual aesthetics evoke a country fable feeling and created a jarring contrast between an idealized setting and a harshly real plot. It feels as if the film is a Hollywood retelling of someone’s life where the people and places are just slightly too beautiful and the events are exaggerated to make a point.
Though sometimes confusing and overly poetic, Are You Here delivers in heart and authenticity of characters. The true highlights are the complex and emotional performances by Poehler, Galifianakis and Wilson that showcase the actors’ abilities to transcend their genres and move into more serious drama. Weiner succeeds in testing our expectations about the modern bromance and taps into the meaning of friendship even in ugly circumstances. Are You Here opens in theaters on Aug. 22.

Another blockbuster season has come and gone, and all the Transformers, Expendables and Ninja Turtles have crawled back into Hollywood’s toy box for another year. This summer’s cinematic offerings were filled with missed opportunities (the underwritten, overpopulated Amazing Spider-Man 2), box office disappointments (the clever but doomed Edge of Tomorrow), off-the-grid triumphs (Snowpiercer, A Most Wanted Man), art-house alternatives (Boyhood, Ida) and more than a few pleasant surprises Guardians of the Galaxy and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes both proved that tentpole movies can be every bit as intelligent, heartfelt and character-driven as their more modestly budgeted counterparts. So as the weather cools and the beaches empty, it’s time to look forward to a darker, weirder crop of films. Here, in order of their release dates, are the 10 that sound the most promising.

1. Tusk (Sept. 19)
Writer-director Kevin Smith continues his foray into the horror genre with Tusk, the diabolical tale of Mr. Howe, a legendary seafarer and wealthy eccentric played with snarling exuberance by veteran character actor Michael Parks, who lures an unsuspecting podcaster (Justin Long) to his secluded Canadian estate with the intent of surgically and psychologically transforming the young man into a grotesque walrus-human hybrid.
The idea, which sounds like a morbidly humorous gloss on The Human Centipede, reportedly occurred to Smith while reading a bizarre Craiglist ad during one of his podcasts, but the concept remained little more than a running joke until his Twitter followers convinced him to move forward with the project, using the hashtag #WalrusYes to pledge their support. Smith’s last movie, the religious fundamentalist baiting horror movie Red State, also starring Parks, was a welcome departure from the filmmaker’s usual brand of chatty vulgarity, and it’s always fun to watch Silent Bob blaze new trails, so to speak.
 
2. The Boxtrolls (Sept. 26)
The newest offering from Laika Entertainment, the stop motion mavens behind Coraline and ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls promises to be another visually arresting, emotionally resonant adventure for children of all ages. The story, adapted from the novel Here Be Monsters! by Alan Snow, focuses on an orphan boy named Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright)and his surrogate family, a subterranean race of garbage collectors known as the Boxtrolls. When the residents of Eggs’ hometown turn to fanatical exterminator Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) to get rid of the Boxtrolls, Eggs must fight to save the only home he’s ever known. The movie also features the vocal talents of Elle Fanning and Toni Collette, not to mention the ever-dependable comedic duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
 
3. Gone Girl (Oct. 3)
David Fincher (Se7en, Zodiac) follows up his sleek, freeze-dried take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo with another murder mystery based on a popular novel, this time an adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s New York Times bestseller Gone Girl. Did handsome Scott Peterson stand-in Nick Dunne (played with an inscrutable blend of charm and smarm by Ben Affleck) really murder his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), or is his crappy personality getting in the way of catching the real killer? The first trailer, set to a haunting cover of  “She” by Richard Butler of the Psychedelic Furs, refuses to spill the beans, suffusing the proceedings with a sleepy tinge of melancholy and menace. Even when Fincher repeats himself, as he seems to be in danger of doing here, his work always bears watching.
 
4. Birdman (Oct. 17)
Ex-Batman Michael Keaton pokes fun at his super-heroic past in Birdman (alternative title: The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), a pitch-black existential comedy from Alejandro González Iñárritu, the typically self-serious Mexican auteur behind Amores Perros, Babel and Biutiful. Keaton stars as has been actor Riggan Thomson, once famous for portraying a winged vigilante called Birdman, who finds himself on the verge of a Black Swan-style identity crisis in the weeks leading up to the opening of his latest Broadway vanity project. Fellow superhero movie veterans Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk) and Emma Stone (The Amazing Spider-Man) appear as Riggan’s egocentric rival and drug-addled daughter, respectively. Expect plenty of hallucinogenic imagery and kinky-costumed cavorting.
 
5. Horns (Oct. 31)
Remember those crazies who said Harry Potter promoted devil worship? This Halloween, they all get to say, “I told you so.” Daniel Radcliffe effectively transfers to Slytherin in Alexandre Aja’s horror comedy Horns, adapted from the novel by Joe Hill (a.k.a. Stephen King’s eerily identical offspring). Radcliffe, who deserves a lot of credit for taking risks and continuing to develop his acting chops in his post Potter career, plays Ignatius “Ig” Perrish, an anti-social outcast who wakes up one day to discover a pair of horns growing out of his head. The new implants give him dark and terrible powers, and he decides to use these to avenge the recent death of his girlfriend. What could go wrong? Quite a lot, as it turns out.
 
6. Interstellar (Nov. 7)
With the exception of the bloated, ponderous Dark Knight Rises, a new Christopher Nolan movie is always cause for celebration. His latest odyssey of obsession is Interstellar, featuring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and, of course, Michael Caine as a group of intrepid explorers who plan on traveling into a newly discovered wormhole in order to sidestep the standard rules of space travel and secure desperately needed resources for the folks back home. The trailer, with its emphasis on McConaughey’s newly widowed engineer and the emotional tumult he feels over having to leave his children, doesn’t give away much, but it appears the Inception director doesn’t want us to give up the dream of human spaceflight just yet.
 
7. Big Hero 6 (Nov. 7)
Based on the comic book series of the same name, Big Hero 6 will be the first Disney animated film to feature Marvel characters since the Mouse House acquired the company back in 2009. The movie revolves around 13-year-old robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter), who lives in the futuristic city of San Fronsokyo with his best friend and pet project, the rotund, playful Baymax. After Hiro uncovers a far-reaching criminal conspiracy, he outfits Baymax as a DIY superhero and embarks on a mission to recruit like-minded crimefighters to put a stop to the threat. And before you ask, it was decided early on that Big Hero 6 would exist in a different continuum from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So don’t expect cartoony versions of Groot and Rocket Raccoon to make an appearance, even though that would be all kinds of awesome.
 
8. Dumb and Dumber To (Nov. 14)
Twenty years after their first idiotic escapade, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) reunite in an effort to find Harry’s grown-up daughter, for whom Lloyd has developed an unhealthy and all-consuming attraction. Comedy sequels are always a tricky business, especially when they arrive so long after the beloved original. The newly released trailer, however, played like gangbusters for the fans, and Carrey and Daniels seem to have retained a deep affection for these characters. The true onus will be on the Farrelly brothers, who haven’t made a decent movie since Osmosis Jones premiered back in 2001.
 
9. Foxcatcher (Nov. 14)
Steve Carell is generating serious Oscar buzz for his chilling, transformative portrayal of John Eleuthère du Pont, the amateur sports sponsor and paranoid schizophrenic who murdered his friend and Olympic freestyle wrestling champion Dave Schultz in the winter of 1996. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo co-star in the film, which was directed by Bennett Miller, who first demonstrated a great aptitude for dramatizing history in Capote, produced in 2005.
 
10. The Imitation Game (Nov. 21)
The Imitation Game stars Benedict Cumberbatch as mathematician and logician Alan Turing, an instrumental force in cracking Germany’s vaunted enigma code during the decisive days of World War II who was criminally prosecuted for his homosexuality in the years following his great service to the empire. The film is the English-language debut of Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, whose propulsive, mordantly funny thriller Headhunters was one of the very best films of 2011. This looks to be of the same rare quality.

Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus Rift for $2 billion started a worldwide frenzy surrounding virtual reality. Those who are not techies often wonder if it is actually possible to be transported into an interactive realm. Does this mean that when an individual plays Grand Theft Auto, I’ll actually feel like a felon crashing planes into streets? Often, virtual reality is met with skepticism, and rightly so — primitive products in the ’90s were nothing to brag about, but Oculus Rift, Sony and many other companies are on the verge of a new technological revolution.
This immersive multimedia is not just limited to the Silicon Valley; junior cinematic arts major Cosmo Scharf is breaking ground in the already up-and-coming virtual reality industry. Scharf is the founder of Virtual Reality Los Angeles (VRLA), a series of mini conventions that mark the first of their kind in the virtual reality industry.
“VRLA is a monthly meet-up event in Los Angeles designed to build and foster a community of VR developers, vendors, hobbyists and enthusiasts,” VRLA’s website says. “VRLA is the best place to get hands on time with exciting games and demos, get valuable feedback on your software and explore this incredible new art form together.”
Scharf’s credentials for hosting a virtual reality experience go well beyond just the typical bandwagon fan. His passion for virtual reality began even before Oculus Rift’s acquisition.
“My interest in VR peaked about half a year ago when I read a blog post about a game developer’s reaction to Valve’s VR prototype. I realized VR’s true potential and started getting more involved in the community by regularly reading the Oculus subreddit and listening to a podcast called RevVR,” Scharf said. “The bizarre thing was that I had just met most of the executives of Oculus in person at GDC in San Francisco days prior to the acquisition.”
“One night I was listening to RevVR, and they were talking about how people were creating VR meetups, something I had never considered before. I looked online and there was nothing in Los Angeles,” Scharf  said. “So I seized the opportunity and decided to build a community of people who shared my passion for VR, not knowing how I was going to do it whatsoever.”
VRLA has now had three meet-ups. These gatherings have boasted Oculus showcases, Jaunt and even Flappy Bird in VR. Additionally, there have been hundreds of attendees, including Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer David X. Cohen. Scharf’s vision for VRLA’s growth mirrors the excitement that is bubbling around virtual reality.
“Our goal is to make each event bigger and better than the previous event. We have nearly 450 members on Meetup’s website, which I’m pretty proud of. For our next events, I really want to focus more on education and content creation through hackathons and presentations” Scharf said. “I imagine we’ll aim to provide an environment for developers to get early feedback on their software.”
Scharf simultaneously pioneered and planned these innovative mini-conventions while juggling schoolwork, but, he believes that USC can find success in virtual reality. He hopes to see USC take advantage of the huge innovative space and market generated by Oculus Rift’s acquisition.
“USC is a university on the forefront of VR at the moment, but they are not doing enough. We have the Mixed Reality Lab, and Oculus’ COO Laird Malamed is even a teacher here, but I won’t be satisfied until we have classes specifically designed to teach students how to make content for VR,” Scharf said“I think VR is in dire need of good content. When the Rift launches, there will be an enormous opportunity to be one of the first developers to sell content in their app store. I imagine we’ll have an entire school for VR, just like film production, in the future.”
For many it comes to a surprise that virtual reality can exist outside of just creating a cool game. There have been recent breakthroughs in which Oculus Rift’s headsets have been used for campus tours, and could potentially aid in future medical breakthroughs. For Scharf, his personal vision and interest in virtual reality, outside of gaming, includes its incorporation in something that USC is famous for: cinematic arts.
“I am working on software right now that will enable people from a more traditional filmmaking background to tell stories in VR with my colleagues Jonnie Ross, Adam Levin and Gil Baron,” Scharf said. “I am also considering changing my major to interactive media. I really want to focus on making content for VR. There are many opportunities right now.”

Grand Central Market, located downtown at 317 S. Broadway, is a charming landmark with an innovative edge. Since it opened in 1917, the market has represented the diverse, delicious flavors of Los Angeles and catered to an ever-changing population. Patrons can find everything from fresh banana leaves to artisanal chocolates.

Since its heyday in the 1920s, Grand Central Market has changed with downtown’s shifting landscape to include green grocers, spice vendors and specialty food vendors. The market currently hosts more than 20 vendors and is in the process of expanding.
The newest addition, McConnell’s Ice Cream, started scooping in July.  Their Grand Central Market location is not their first. The Santa Barbara based company has two additional parlors in its hometown and one in Ventura, California. As Chris Farber, director of business development for Grand Central Market, warned, “their ice cream is dangerously good.”
 
Farber’s role in developing the market gives him access to a diverse array of flavors on a daily basis, which he says allows him to see the passion vendors have for the food and the sense of community the market offers. “People cross paths with each other through food. In the mixing ground of L.A., Grand Central Market has a unique role.”
Unlike other corners of the city, the market appeals to people from many different backgrounds. Farber explains that the market’s founder, Ira Yellin, created the market to foster a sense of community. “It allows Angelenos to rub shoulders in ways that are very rare in L.A.”
In addition to attracting a trendier crowd with shops such as G&B Coffee, Better Booch and The Oyster Gourmet, Grand Central Market is also home to ethnic eateries and food purveyors. Some, such as China Cafe, famous for its wonton soup, have been in operation since the 1940s.
Although each stall has its own personality, the market still manages to feel cohesive. The diverse array of options make the market an ideal place to dine with a large group. Friends can share a meal while sampling cuisines from across the world and later peruse the aisles for specialty food products.
Newer patrons are often become repeat customers and experience the full flavors of the market on subsequent trips. “The influx of new businesses have also brought new people to the old businesses — everyone benefits,” Farber said.
Chef David Tewasart, owner of the Thai eatery Sticky Rice, feels the market has evolved noticeably since his restaurant opened a little over a year ago. “Sticky Rice was the first of the second wave of incoming restaurants — we’ve had a front seat to change.”
The influx of downtown residents has expanded the market’s clientele and increased demand for casual food options. “The demographic used to be more homogeneous, now it’s packed every Saturday and Sunday — we also do a big lunch rush — it’s overall a more mixed crowd,” Tewasart said.
Although recent additions include fine food purveyors, such as Belcampo Meat Co. and DTLA Cheese, with limited selections of products, the market retains a welcoming atmosphere. “These people really know their products and are super friendly. The market offers specialty and niche food but in a casual atmosphere — it’s still very accessible — we offer a varied price point,” explains Farber. The market fosters a sense of community between vendors, patrons and the downtown community.
Most stalls have long counters and barstool seating, encouraging customers to linger over their meals and have a taste of downtown Los Angeles. Ample seating and indoor-outdoor spaces also provide a welcoming, casual atmosphere and encourage conversation. As Valerie Gordon, the owner of Valerie Confections says, “the market is friendly, homey and casual.” Even though she offers a full line of artisanal desserts, she feels the location “is very approachable — there are always samples.”
The market also hosts dinner and movie nights at the adjacent Million Dollar Theatre and has plans to expand partnerships with local media outlets and offer additional movie screenings, books signings and lectures. “We’re trying to create a community place — people come for the food and stay because it’s a cultural destination,” Farber said.
In addition to these programs, Grand Central Market recently expanded its hours and now stays open for dinner Thursday through Saturday nights. Aside from increasing foot traffic, these extended hours allow the market’s eateries to offer late night and diner fare.  As Gordon explained, “we are excited to integrate evening components into our menu — it’s a constantly evolving process sparked by customers’ desires and the creative process.”
The market is poised to become downtown’s prime market-style dining location.  According to Chef Tewasart, “Grand Central Market is representative of the city as a whole — it’s diverse, its timing is good, it’s evolving — the market will always be an L.A. thing.”
With its extended hours and plans for expansion, the market is adding flavor and flair to the L.A. dining scene. Grand Central Market’s convenient location, culinary variety and reasonable prices truly allow customers to have their cake and eat it too.

The tragic death of a USC graduate student has once again brought the university’s bearings in its own neighborhood into the spotlight. Unfortunately, when it comes to discussing such topics, the conversation focuses on the danger in the community but does not address the systemic causes of such conditions.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Since the 1960s, the area now known as South Los Angeles has upheld a national reputation for race riots, gang violence and poverty. USC’s campus falls within the region “University Park,” a subarea of Exposition Park.
USC has played an integral role in invigorating the commercial base of the University Park neighborhood. It has implemented countless outreach programs for underserved areas of Los Angeles, including the college preparatory USC Hybrid High School that opened in Downtown Los Angeles in 2012 and the millions of dollars raised through the Good Neighbors Campaign. Throughout the years, students have found several ways to serve the community, including building student organizations for such outreach purposes.
A social divide persists, however, whether it’s in the comments about the neighborhood uttered among students or within administrative policies.
After the tragic deaths of two graduate students near campus in the spring of 2012 and, a few months after, the shooting that occurred at an on-campus Halloween party, the university implemented a massive overhaul of its security policies. Collapsable security gates appeared at the Jefferson and Exposition street entrances. Security personnel were stationed at university entrances from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. to check the identification of anyone entering campus. On top of that, fingerprint scanners were installed at the main entrance to dorms on campus.
Still, some student coalitions and faculty members raised concerns about the kind of message the image of gates and guards posted all along the campus boundary might send to the community. Overall, the perceived contrast between USC and the surrounding South Los Angeles area is an archetype of greater socioeconomic stratification in society. Even in light of charitable acts and organizations, the prevailing discourse and social realities maintain the divide between the haves and the have-nots, keeping each to their respective spaces.
South Los Angeles is often portrayed as a brutish place. A class of fifth graders from the South Shore area of Chicago recognized the same phenomenon in their own neighborhood, with the press regularly coming in to cover outbreaks of violence and dubbing it a “Terror Town.” In response, the fifth graders wrote a counternarrative about what their home means to them in spite of how it’s nationally represented.  It was published in the Chicago Tribune in July. Similarly, the reputation of South Los Angeles often focuses on the violence and gang activity rather than the relationships of power and oppression that feed into them. A recent incident in which more than 79 LAPD officers in full riot gear shut down a party of mostly black and Latino students shows that not only are these issues still present, but also why they should be important to the university.
It is crucial to understand the complex social and historical forces that have come to shape a neighborhood while actively affecting it. The university has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its students, but so long as it occupies the space that it currently does, it should also analyze the messages it sends to the community.
 
I am tired of reading articles pontificating on the hurtful symbolism of security gates and highly visible security measures. Let’s face it – most people who are tenured professors or high level admin at USC do not live near USC – primarily because it is not a safe neighborhood! Let’s not talk about hurtful symbolisms of security gates if those gates are meant to protect the campus. USC Admin will never admit why they never live in teh same neighborhood as the university – even though they keep espousing to students what a lively ad vibrant community USC is located in. I will believe this when President Nikias and the admin in Bovard actually decide to plant stakes and love their families to live in North University Park.
In case you didn’t already know Trey, the “editor” is the USC administration since the “Daily Trojan” is the propaganda arm of USC. It is no longer Daily or independent.
The area north of campus, known as North University Park, is
now almost all USC students. It used to be a mixed area, but no longer. The attack
and death of a graduate student occurred in this area very close to campus.
There are security cameras (web cams) everywhere and signs that indicate that
the area is monitored. This has created a false sense of security. What has not
come to light and not acknowledged by the USC administration is that the web
cams were not monitored in real time. As a cost saving measure recordings exist
but real time monitoring did not. That is why they were able to catch the assailants
but ho help came for the victim. Perhaps this will change, but since the
University installed the web cams and signs in the North University Park area
without permits and without community input, it must bear some responsibility
for the tragic consequences. In my opinion the web cams installed in this area
(not the ones on campus) should be available to all on the internet. Then help
might arrive.

As the price of higher education continues to rise, so do the median salaries of recent college graduates. Unfortunately, with student debt reaching unprecedented heights, pay isn’t increasing as fast as is necessary for graduates to pay off their loans.
Lili Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco established that between 2006 and 2013, the overall workforce saw a 15 percent increase in median salary, while recent college graduates only received an increase of six percent, according to the Los Angeles Times. It is an age-old paradox: the very education that could propel students into monetary success is creating additional years of financial burden. It’s clear that there is no easy fix to this discrepancy between tuition cost and salary increase, and some have suggested that college isn’t worth its high price.
The statistics, however, provide more context. College graduates overall are paid more than both high school graduates and those who obtain a GED. Its high price tag has created a sense of entitlement in students seeking jobs post-graduation, and with that, has reduced the meaning of the college experience to monetary results. Still, college continues to be a valuable life tool.
Americans are drawn to attending colleges and universities. There are so many in the U.S. that the U.S. News & World Report only provides rankings for roughly 1800 of them. High school students pack their schedules full of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses in addition to long lists of extracurricular activities, all in the hopes of impressing and gaining entrance into top-tier colleges. College Confidential, a web-based forum, lends tips and tricks about the college application process, embedded in the stress-induced conversations of high-strung parents and students. Numerous companies and businesses have risen out of this newfound higher education industry, including the Common Application, the College Board and the many college counselors and standardized testing tutors.
Nowadays, the college application process has transformed into a rite of passage for high school seniors. But with the craze comes a sense of privilege.
The entitlement is certainly understandable. After paying upward of $200,000 in college tuition and spending an additional four years in the classroom, graduates might feel they deserve something that rewards them for the money and hard work invested in their education. But entitlement and elitism go hand in hand, and in some cases the notion of elitism can start at the college or university.
With the use of technology and social media, colleges are able to market themselves favorably toward parents and prospective students in a way that is more accessible, in addition to their usual mailings and pamphlets.
Schools start a hypothetical arms race, however, when trying to attract students. Colleges and universities everywhere are building Olympic-size swimming pools, state-of-the-art research facilities, hiring world-renowned faculty members and even attracting celebrity professors.
It is hard to blame the universities for these additions. If their schools appear to be more desirable, a greater number of students will apply and the acceptance rates will decrease, making the schools more exclusive. With this mentality, it’s easy to see how college elitism has taken a new form in the 21st century. Higher education can no longer be exclusively for the extremely wealthy, but with a larger number of applicants, colleges themselves have become more elite institutions. More importantly, their graduates might feel entitled to a job over a peer who attended a “lesser” university or one who didn’t attend one at all. The modern day workforce, which drives consumerism, the economy and daily life, is populated with college graduates all vying for the same jobs. A college degree is no longer a distinguishing feature on résumés. Therefore the entitlement factor is no longer warranted.
The rising tuition fees and student debt, elitism and entitlement work together in a cyclical process. Critics say that a degree isn’t worth the financial hassle, which, in some cases, might be true. According to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics study of people, the median weekly earnings for a bachelor’s degree holder age 25 or older is $1,108, versus $651 for a high school graduate. Strictly looking at degrees from a salary viewpoint, college continues to reap more benefits than a high school education can.
The perks of college, however, are not always tangible or monetary. Students take chances, learn from mistakes and define and develop their own values before fully heading off into adulthood. Though the four years spent at academia are a safety blanket with an investment price tag, a college education unlocks the door of opportunities and networks that would be difficult to obtain otherwise in addition to giving students the discipline necessary make smart choices in a world of opportunities.
Yet no one is entitled to education, jobs or money, and hard work is essential in order to succeed. This is the new American way, and college is here to stay.
 
The question is what does the money go on? Not to the professors who teach you (ask your profs next time you get a chance), but to a bloated administration and to trying to run an educational institution like a business. And to paying for ridiculous facilities. Students need to raise their voices against tuition hikes, we need to start prioritizing our public universities again as motors of social mobility, and we need USC to focus on research and teaching, not shiny buildings and paying marketing people. It’s OUR university, not the administration’s.

“Boys will be boys!”
It’s a seemingly harmless expression that calls to mind images of laughing parents dismissing their sons’ horseplay. Within the context of the ongoing issue of sexual assault on campus, however, this phrase gains eerie new significance. Boys will be boys — in other words, it is in their nature to take what or whomever they want, so women have to protect themselves.
Jennifer Frazin | Daily Trojan
 
Worded that way, it all sounds incredibly primal, but this mindset is more prevalent than one might think. Worse still, its effects are directly impacting students at USC.
On July 9, a survey prepared by the Senate Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight at the request of Chairman Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) went public. The results of this survey revealed that many U.S. institutions fall short of meeting legal standards for handling on-campus sexual violence. Fifty-five universities are currently under federal investigation. USC is one of the four located in California.
This might come as a shock to the typical USC student, considering the various campus resources available to sexual assault victims. After all, on-campus support appears to be better than ever; a Google search of “USC sexual assault” leads directly to the comprehensive USC Sexual Assault Resource Center website. The SARC website provides links on the victim’s reporting rights, on- and off-campus resources and more. The SARC is housed within the Center for Women and Men, a division of USC Student Affairs that works to provide support and confidential counseling to victims of any violence or harassment related to gender. Its agenda includes MenCARE, a program that provides training for men and studies on how male students respond to and perceive sexual assault. Yet, despite efforts to combat sexual violence, USC has hit several stumbling blocks.
Central to this issue is the problematic “rape culture” in which we live. According to USC Marriage and Family Therapy Program Lead Dr. Ginger Clark, rape culture is a term used by many women’s rights groups to “describe a set of beliefs and behaviors that make rape an acceptable condition of living.”
“The first and most powerful of those beliefs is that women do not have the right to be openly sexual beings,” Clark said via email. “They are not seen as independent people who own the rights to their bodies.”
It is this archaic misconception, among many consequent factors, that fuels the prevalence of sexual violence in society at large and at USC. “Rape culture” operates on double standards. If a woman withholds sex, she is frigid or prudish. If a woman embraces her sexuality, she is a “slut.” Essentially, the odds are stacked against female sexuality no matter what, and the catch-22 doesn’t end there. Prudes and sluts aside, it seems that no woman is more condemned than she who “friend-zones” good-hearted suitors.
Clark provides a powerful counterargument to those who complain about women having “all the choice” when it comes to their own sexuality.
“When a man is not attracted to a woman, there is not the same level of outrage to his withholding of attention or sexual intercourse,” she wrote. “But in ‘rape culture’ when a woman is not attracted to a man and chooses not to be with him, it is seen as her abusing her power … as if sex were the customary and socially expected response.”
Clearly, this is a socially ingrained behavior, and reversing this mindset will not be easy. Still, there is a solution.
Instead of teaching women to prevent their own sexual assault, Clark suggests targeting the assailant and increasing accountability among men and bystanders alike.
“[Men] are thinking, feeling, intelligent people … who are able to examine their own thinking and behavior, but we have not treated them this way,” Clark insists. “We have assumed they cannot change. I believe this is a mistake, and deeply disrespectful to both men and women.”
Instead of buying into this flawed, two-dimensional logic, it is the responsibility of all Trojans and all human beings to respect one another. USC students are fortunate enough to have the resources available to make a difference, both on campus and in the world at large; it is in their power to promote programs like MenCARE in advocating the role of men in preventing sexual violence. Moreover, speaking up and encouraging male friends to respect women and their right to consent goes a lot farther than one might think. Trojans might not be able to immediately halt global sexual violence, but it is well within their power to put an end to this epidemic on-campus. To quote Clark once more, “Trojans can be the trailblazers to help eradicate rape culture everywhere.”
 
A lot of people have been working on this for a long time. A big shout out to the womens’ student assembly, those brave survivors of rape and sexual assault from USC who have come forward to tell their story, and the allies who have stood in solidarity. USC needs to do more. A lot more. And the damaging culture on Frat Row, but also in classrooms, small dorms and whispered conversations in libraries, need to take on the underlying causes of these horrors: the lack of real equality, and equality of respect, between men and women. It should start with this generation. Now.

The United States’ foreign policy in the Middle East, for the better part of the 20th century and all of the 21st century, has been predicated on antiquated quid pro quo tactics and imperialist motives that have been covered by the veneer of diplomacy. The rise of the Islamic State, in recent months, adds to the already complicated  situation in the Middle East. With the conflict in Gaza, the U.S. faces a critical moment in shaping its influence and position in the region. The Obama administration must decide how its foreign policy will dictate the affairs in the Middle East. That is to say, will the U.S. retrace in its own footsteps or will it look to depart from the status quo?
Previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the group is an independent organization that stems from Sunni/Shi’ite sectarianism that has plagued Iraq for decades. The Islamic State targets Shi’ites as enemies, condemning them as threats. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of  the Islamic State, has vowed to expand the group’s territory and create a territorial state of its own. In recent months, it has made efforts on that front, gaining strongholds in major areas and taking control of Iraq’s largest dam, Mosul Dam, and other strategic military locations. The Obama administration has lent humanitarian and military aid to Iraq, but stopped short of any ground operation or deployment of troops, underscoring the belief that the U.S. will not endeavor to fight another war in Iraq.
The current situation in Iraq looks bleak. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s failed policies have exacerbated problems in a nation mired in sectarian conflict and the hope of a coalition government that will unite Shi’ites and Sunnis together looks grim. The current state of Iraq  demonstrates the U.S.’s failed foreign policy and paints a picture of a poorly managed system of diplomacy in the region.
After the first Gulf War, the U.S. stopped the expansionist ambitions of Saddam Hussein. In 2003, Hussein was removed, despite the fact that earlier assumptions about him possessing weapons of mass destruction proved false. The U.S. then assumed the responsibility of nation-building and tried to help establish a functioning democracy in a country that has never truly seen one. The rise of the Islamic State and an increase in sectarian division has shown that the U.S. has largely failed in that respect. The Islamic State is a reaction to myriad actions taken by Western nations to build a democracy with no regard to cultural and religious boundaries. The U.S. view that Iraq was and still is incapable of building its own government continues to fuel instability and further divide parties involved.
In the events that have transpired so far, the Islamic State has shed light on the inability of the U.S. to moderate peace in an unstable region. With the world’s eyes on Gaza, the Islamic State has been able to snag U.S. weapons that have been left on the battlefield. It is ludicrous and comical to think that the U.S. is attempting to fight a force to which it has indirectly supplied arms. The Obama administration’s continued support of Maliki’s regime underscores a lack of insight — change is necessary if Iraqis ever hope to wake up to something other than attack sirens.
The world needs to take notice of the events happening in Iraq. The recent fighting between Israel and Hamas is yet another iteration in the long history of conflict in the region. However, the Islamic State poses new threats. The Obama administration has an opportunity to change the status quo with the situation in regard to the Islamic State. Will the U.S. employ the policies of old by simply removing a threat and installing a favorable coalition? Or will Obama and the West recognize the sectarianism that mires the region and look to help Iraqis themselves fill the vacuum that the Islamic State is occupying?
The failed policies of the U.S. and the West in the past have created a situation in Iraq that continues to repeat itself, and the Islamic State is a result of another reiteration of that narrative. The Obama administration faces a tough road ahead in determining whether to continue policy that has dictated action for decades or pave a new path and enact initiatives that will help Iraqis decide what is best for them and their country.
The conflicts in Iraq are difficult ones to contend with and the current situation opens a new chapter that could possibly help bring peace and stability to a nation that deserves just that.
What power does the USA have? Threats of war? The USA is so debt ridden that countries are looking at alternates to the dollar for international exchange. The dollar is so weak that it takes more to buy the same food products nearly every year. Is it not every year that the President and Congress agree to spend more than comes in from taxes, fees and penalties? Rich nations can afford war. Unified nations can afford war. The USA is neither.

In our society, makeup and women often go hand-in-hand, but several women recently have tried to divorce the two, with some serious pushback. Annie Garau, a student at Indiana University, made a seemingly harmless New Year’s resolution: no makeup for a year. For her, this resolution began as a social experiment.
Alana Grayson | Daily Trojan
 
Two hundred days later, on July 19, Garau wrote an article for Kentucky’s Lexington Herald-Leader about her progress. Instead of feeling clean, free or relieved, Garau found herself feeling “uncomfortable, undesirable and embarrassed.” When she talked to other young women about her experiment, they admitted that they admired her cause, but would never even consider going a weekend without makeup.
Garau spent the rest of her article going through statistics and quoting professionals on how much time and effort is put in to beautification. But in the end, all the numbers and interviews just summarized one haunting fact: a college girl choosing not to wear makeup is considered news. And it shouldn’t be. Women should have the choice to wear makeup without it becoming a statement.
American women are increasingly comfortable talking about third-party influences of beauty. There are videos all over the internet revealing the deceptive qualities of Photoshop. There are blogs and tweets about Jennifer Lawrence’s “normal” eating habits and Miss Indiana’s “normal” bikini body. It has become women’s battle cry to tell our young girls that the people in magazines don’t actually look perfect and that all people are beautiful just the way they are.
And yet, mothers regularly go out and buy their daughters their first eyeliner pencil. It should be no surprise that 90 percent of women report feeling unhappy with their appearance, as a study commissioned by Dove reported.
People don’t actually want to talk about real beauty. It’s easy to rail against fake pictures of women. Anyone can complain about beautiful people getting a leg up. Garau actually did something about it; she hasn’t worn makeup for more than 200 days now. Though honorable and intelligent, Garau’s actions obviously can’t change a culture where you just don’t leave the house without mascara.
Singer Colbie Caillat did something similar with her music video for “Try,” released on June 8. The song, which is about not trying too hard to be liked, features Caillat and a diverse group of women slowly removing their makeup to reveal their faces underneath it all.
Though her message was brave and wise, Caillat’s efforts were diminished when much of the mainstream media decided to make it about Photoshop instead of makeup. The portion of the music video that discussed photo editing lasted no more than three seconds. Despite that, the headlines for Huffington Post, USA Today, MTV and many others said that Caillat’s video was about the misleading effects of photo editing.
In an interview for Elle magazine, Caillat says the music video is about “all these things that all of us girls do everyday to get ready to go out.” However, Elle titled the article “Colbie Caillat Is Tired of Being Photoshopped: Here’s What She Did About It.” Caillat only briefly mentions Photoshop, and she did it in relation to an old album cover, not the music video in question.
The media outlets that reported about Garau were more than happy to tell her story like it is — a 20-year-old college student not wearing makeup. But they refused to acknowledge that a celebrity might join in on the discussion. Perhaps it’s out of self-interest. After all, Elle in particular thrives off of the makeup industry.
But it’s much more likely that it’s a subconscious gut reaction. Even the strongest, most powerful women would probably feel uncomfortable sitting in their corner offices without a hint of light eye shadow. Nobody wants to be told that something they do every day isn’t necessary, and that it might even be bad.
None of this is to say that makeup in itself is the enemy. Sometimes, just the right color of eye shadow brings out the green in your eyes. The perfect bronzer can make your beautiful cheekbones stand out. Makeup can also be enjoyable — there’s some serious bonding that can take place with your friends while listening to Beyoncé and picking out the right shade of lipstick before a night on the town.
But it shouldn’t be story-worthy when a girl decides she doesn’t feel like using makeup.
The real enemy isn’t Photoshop, celebrities or makeup. The real enemies are the lies women tell themselves about how to be beautiful. The media says women really don’t have to try so hard. If everyone truly believed that, going 200 — or even 365 — days without makeup would be a breeze.

The Corinthian Colleges, one of the largest for-profit college chains in America, decided last month to sell 85 and shut down 12 of its campuses nationwide — the final nail in the coffin of this corporate university giant. With it, the post-secondary education company has dragged the fundamental issues of for-profit education under the magnifying glass.
Corinthian’s downfall follows allegations about fabricating job placement statistics, grades and attendance. California Attorney General Kamala Harris has been actively campaigning against these claims since last year, which expand to emotionally manipulative advertising that targets families in poverty while falsely promising them a high-quality education, career counseling and personal attention — all at the oh-so-reasonable price of $40,000 for an associate’s degree, a tag that is 10 times the cost of a comparable education at a community college, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Despicable doesn’t quite begin to cover this debacle. Corinthian officials painstakingly crafted marketing pitches to capitalize on the dream of using education as a gateway to a better life, while advisers sidestepped questions about debt and credit transfer. Corinthian spokesman Kent Jenkins claimed a 69 percent job placement rate — inflated artificially by many means, one of which considers former employment and employment at temp agencies as job placement, according to a former employee. In reality, according to the L.A. Times, almost 37 percent of students defaulted on school loan debt within 3 years of graduating.
Heidi Vella, a 50-year-old student previously in Everest College’s surgical assistant program, had been drowning in debt ever since graduating in 2010. She finally found a temporary position in her field two years later.
“If I ever thought that my life would be where it is now, I never would have gone to Everest. It’s made my life worse,” Vella told the L.A. Times.
As higher education becomes a larger prerequisite for jobs, more individuals in or near poverty seek practical ways to gain a degree and specialized skills. Often these individuals come from families that have never gone to college. So to turn around and manipulate these individuals when they are in need of assistance is a particularly ruthless brand of deception that spits in the face of education programs everywhere.
Corinthian’s profiteering revolves around federal funding. According to the Wall Street Journal, the college chain receives about $1.4 billion in federal funds every year. The more students the company enrolls, the more funding it gets, giving them motivation to attract as many students as possible to maximize profits. The philosophy of Corinthian’s traditions, however, is much more disturbing than just the effects at face value. According to the Corinthian homepage, they strive to uphold their core values, which include “integrity, service, excellence and accountability.” The irony of its professed commitment to “integrity” and “accountability” is not lost on the hundreds of thousands of students misled by the system. Its core values add yet another layer of deception to what should be the fundamental base of the Corinthian education system, which is instead fueled by a voracious hunger for profits.
Corinthian is not alone in its deceptive practices. The Premier Education Group was sued in 2011 for similarly misrepresenting records and requirements in order to keep federal funding. The Education Management Corporation was sued in 2011 for encouraging students to enroll and pay even if they did not qualify for the program. QuinStreet Inc. was sued in 2012 for preying on veterans and other students. Last week, the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix was banned from adding veterans to seven of its programs following allegations that it unfairly targeted military personnel eligible for federal funding. The list goes on and on.
The important question to address following these ethical violations is whether there is a fundamental problem with the concept of for-profit education. Sure, primarily financial motives definitely don’t sound good, but corporations in the past have proven to stand their ground or even surpass nonprofits in terms of efficiency. The effectiveness of corporations rings especially true for fields that require constant innovation — and higher education could use some innovation. Perhaps for-profit colleges have not had the chance to stand on their own.
The Obama administration has worked on making the for-profit college sector accountable, but more action is needed. If for-profit colleges want to treat students as consumers, then fine — but they shouldn’t be rewarded with federal funding. In fact, removing federal funding might actually help these corporations become more transparent. Desperate moves to keep graduation numbers and federal funding up will be replaced by efforts to build a trustworthy reputation like any other corporation. Though such a procedure will require some serious investors considering the astronomical costs of running a college, if set up and executed properly, it’s definitely possible.
 
There are so many for-profit predators in higher education that it’s difficult to count.  Some are becoming zombie schools, taking in tens of billions of dollars from the government, destroying the credit of working class students and their families, but still losing money.  EDMC (Art Institutes) owned in part by Goldman Sachs,  ITT Tech and Career Education (Cordon Bleu) both owned in part by California Regent Richard Blum,  Lincoln Tech, and Apollo Group (University of Phoenix) are either losing students or losing money, or both.

Anyone who would contend that USC is the same university it was 15 years ago has either not recently visited the continuously expanding campus, has neglected to meet any graduates from that time period or is, bluntly put, a UCLA Bruin of the worst kind.
The $1.1 billion renovation of the University Village into the USC Village will continue to help the university change and grow for the better. Since 1999, USC has soared 18 spots in rankings to No. 23 and is ranked  10th in the U.S. News & World Report list of “Up-and-Coming Universities.” The university looks like it has no intention of slowing its growth with the construction of the USC Village underway at the site of the old UV.
The USC Village will mark a new era in USC’s history. There might be costs to the progress, but this project is in line with the pace of the ever-changing Los Angeles, a city that has been very central to USC’s development and culture.
For students, the next few years call for a few adjustments to life without the convenience  of Superior Grocers and the option of grabbing frozen yogurt at 21 Choices. Though students will lose access to some amenities during the years of construction, the finished product promises a set of new resources that will cater to students’ needs.
With more than two million square feet of student housing, retail and academic landscape, the Village will give the university the college-town feel that this little corner of the city has previously lacked. Granted, one of the things that makes USC great is its integration with urban Los Angeles.
Some have viewed the renovations as being at the expense of the university’s neighbors, raising the rent, property tax and cost of living in their homes. The university said, however, that it has taken the community into consideration during these changes. According to USC officials, the project will create 12,000 jobs, a third of which are temporary construction jobs The other 8,000 will be permanent upon its opening. USC has also guaranteed employment priority to people of the surrounding neighborhood and granted $20 million to aid with affordable housing in the area.
Los Angeles is the next frontier.  The university isn’t destroying a piece of the city by erecting its own village, but rather continuing the trend that the rest of the city has already begun. It seems only fitting that USC would grow, develop and change as well. As brutal as it is, if USC did not capitalize on the UV to match the developing trend of the rest of Los Angeles, another organization would have.
USC is becoming better equipped than ever to not only exist in this future, but also shape it.

USC is a university in a constant state of progress.This sentiment is perhaps best reflected in the various improvements to the University both physically — the building of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall, The Village construction — and academically with USC’s sustained rise to prominence as an elite international research university.
This progress has occurred simultaneously with the continuous improvements and gentrification in nearby Downtown Los Angeles, essentially establishing the area as L.A.’s de facto cultural epicenter.
The university’s efforts to improve resources, student life and academics in conjunction with Downtown LA’s improvements implicitly reflect our personal duties as Trojans to continue to improve ourselves in every facet of our involvement, whether it be in the classroom, in the workplace or in the community.
But as we continue to make progress, we as students must not lose sight of our core Trojan values.
This past summer was a difficult one for the Trojan Family. The slaying of graduate student Xinran Ji, the tragic death of incoming Trojan Nick Fagnano, Maj. Gen. Harold Greene’s death in Afghanistan and the loss of World War II hero, Olympian and lifelong Trojan Louis Zamperini deeply impacted the USC community.
Zamperini embodied the Trojan spirit and lent palpable meaning to the words “Fight On.” It was his fighting spirit which helped him overcome immeasurable odds and harrowing treatment while detained as a prisoner of war in Japan in 1945. It was only through incredible difficulty, however, that Zamperini was given the opportunity to reveal his character.
Progress is generally viewed as positive, but it fails to account for a fundamental principle which drives it. In this way, instead of characterizing our university as being in progress, we like to think of it as a process of refinement. As the university continues to push on toward the future, it should also be revealing its truest character by virtue of the difficulties of the process.
The theme for this semester’s Orientation Issue is The Trojan, Refined/Redefined. As college students, our primary mission should be to endlessly refine ourselves: personally, socially, academically and professionally.
A true process of refinement is never easy. Businesses in the former University Village were displaced by construction efforts, and USC’s transition into an elite national university has come with some growing pains in shedding its perception as a “party school.”
But in pursuing our goals, we as Trojans must never forsake who we are and the legacy left by those who came before us. The concept of the Trojan Family is as important as ever as the university’s student body becomes increasingly diverse. Fighting on in the face of adversity, as Zamperini did, is vital for a university that will commence its semester on the heels of a summer fraught with tragedy.
“Trojan Family” and “Fight On” are not simple buzzwords to invoke an ad hoc sense of Trojan Pride. They are principles that are intrinsic to the Trojan identity. We hope to emphasize those principles in doing our very best to serve our readers this semester. The Fall 2014 Daily Trojan Editorial Board is committed to this idea of refinement, of constantly improving while being mindful of the tradition established by previous generations.
So on behalf of the Daily Trojan staff, thank you for your readership. It will be an honor to serve you.

Peace and stability have long been elusive to the people of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, but the most recent round of hostilities in the Holy Land has caught the eye of the international community. Many on the world stage call for a cease-fire to what has arguably been the most violent struggle in the region’s recent memory.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Both Israelis and Palestinians agreed to extend the 72-hour truce that began Aug. 10 for five additional days, according to the Guardian. This cease-fire, current as of press time, is the eighth attempt at halting fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Nevertheless, what remains uncertain, is if the cease-fire will continue to hold, let alone result in any real progress.
The month-long Israeli operation in Gaza, dubbed Operation Protective Edge, has claimed the lives of approximately 2,000 people since the operation began on July 8. Of the devastating casualties, more than 1,910 Palestinians were killed — most of whom were civilians. On the Israeli sides, 64 soldiers and three civilians were killed.
The violence in Israel and Gaza, however, did not occur in a vacuum. In fact, it has been reminiscent of preceding operations between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. The 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense claimed the lives of 180 Palestinians and six Israelis altogether. Operation Cast Lead of 2008 claimed the lives of approximately 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis over the 22-day military campaign.
The cease-fire has restored temporary calm in this unstable region. It is uncertain whether the cease-fire will continue to hold, but the lesson from Operation Protective Edge and its preceding operations is clear — a cease-fire is not enough.
The recent operation was directly provoked by the kidnapping and murders of young civilians and violent Israeli Defense Forces raids in the West Bank, but the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have been a natural repercussion of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since Israel disengaged from the strip in 2005 and the subsequent rocket fire from Hamas militants that has continually threatened Israeli civilian centers. In this nine-year period, Gaza has been on lockdown, with its heavily unemployed and densely populated civilian population confined by the Israeli buffer zone. Returning to such an unsustainable status quo would be both a foolish and irresponsible diplomatic failure for Gaza.
As Israeli and Palestinian delegations met in Cairo to resume Egyptian-brokered negotiations this past Sunday, it is imperative that leaders on both sides secure a long-term agreement beyond a temporary truce. A return to the status quo only stands to return the Palestinians of Gaza to life under strict blockade, and the Israelis to life of temporary calm and uncertainty. If Israel’s security is paramount and if the world is as overwhelmed by the death and devastation in Gaza as it says it is, a permanent diplomatic solution must be pursued.
According to J.J. Goldberg of The Jewish Daily Forward, Israel’s demands include a complete halt of rocket fire from Gaza, Israeli control over border crossings to be opened between Gaza and Israel in the framework of the agreement and for the Palestinian Authority to take control over the payment of public workers in Gaza. Hamas demands the lift of the strict blockade on Gaza, including the expansion of the coastal waters permitted by Israel for Gaza’s fishermen, a reopening of the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt and an expansion of the goods permitted to be imported from Israel to Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not return to the negotiating table under fire. Just as Palestinians don’t have the luxury of declining negotiating under occupation, Israel too must accept that an end to the hostilities will come as a result of diplomatic, and not military, means. Rather than continue its chokehold on the Palestinian territories, which in turn only perpetuates resistance and gives strength to violent resistance groups like Hamas, Israel now has the opportunity to empower the more moderate Palestinian leadership of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and lift the strict blockade and siege of Gaza that has made life in the strip untenable.
Military and political might aside, neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian people can endure another round of violence every two to three years. In addition to a cease-fire, there needs to be justice, accountability and a responsible diplomatic solution that secures the safety and security of all civilians on both sides of the Green Line — lest we wish to see an “Operation Déjà Vu” in the near future.
