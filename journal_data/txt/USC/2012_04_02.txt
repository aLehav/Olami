The chair was established in honor of Edward G. Lewis, a 1970 graduate of USC Law’s Board of Councilors. The chair will provide a permanent endowment or a perpetual grant to support the work of professors in the Gould School of Law.
Staudt, a nationally recognized tax scholar, began her career as a lawyer in San Francisco. She served as a professor at Northwestern University Law School until she came to USC in June 2011. She currently has faculty appointments in the Gould School of Law and the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
Staudt has enjoyed her experience so far at USC, especially working with students and her colleagues, she said.
“The faculties in both these schools are just so smart and collegial,” Staudt said. “It really makes for a bright and vibrant experience. I teach both law students and undergraduate students as well and the students are so interested and interesting, so spending time with the faculty and students has been wonderful.”
The endowed chair not only reflects her achievements, but also the caliber of the university, Staudt said.
“What’s exciting about [becoming a chair] is that only really great universities award these types of honors,” Staudt said. “It’s an exciting moment because USC is really becoming so fantastic and to be recognized at such a fantastic institution is a real honor.”
Stadut said one of her principal goals is to improve the university through the Lewis Chair.
“I’ve really been thinking about this award as not only a motivator to work hard in the classroom and as a researcher, but as a responsibility to contribute to the school and the students,” Staudt said. “Not only do I get to glow in this new status, but I really need to be motivated to help this university become even greater.”
Staudt’s current research is focused on the relationship between financial innovation and the legal community, such as innovative ways of creating initial public offerings.

The School of Pharmacy and the School of Social Work will hold their first annual interdisciplinary conference, Medication Use & Society, which focuses on how pharmacists and social workers can provide patients with the best medical care, on Tuesday.
Tenie Khachikian, a graduate student studying social work, created the concept of the conference because a social worker is often responsible for helping a patient understand the health care system and recovery treatments when he leaves the hospital.
“This conference will give an opportunity for students of a respective profession to better understand the other and bridge any gaps that may exist,” Khachikian said.
Khachikian paired up with Tadeh Vartanian, a doctoral student in the School of Pharmacy, and together they set in motion plans for the conference.
Bruce Jansson, a professor of social policy and administration at the School of Social Work, and Dr. Kathleen Johnson, a professor in Dept. of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, will speak at the conference.
Johnson said she is enthusiastic about the conference because it brings together a wide range of speakers and students who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to interact.
“When students get into clinical training they can understand how to interact with a person in a different profession to help the client get better,” Johnson said.
Khachikian said social workers and pharmacists aim to enhance the lives of their patients.
“Though the professions of social work and pharmacy may be different in name and meaning, there are similarities,” Khachikian said. “We are all professionals working together to improve the life of our patients.”

As the result of a recent study that found one in seven Americans are dependent on food stamps, the Graduate Student Government has started the Food Stamp Challenge, a monthlong initiative part of Trojans Unite Against Hunger, a USC-led campaign to stop hunger in the United States.
Dean of Social Work Marilyn Flynn and the Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni are among more than sixty participants who have opted to take the challenge for one to four days. Participants are limited to spending only $4 per day.
“It’s pretty rough,” said Blas Villalobos, a graduate student studying social work. “You actually have to take a look at what you’re eating when you get hungry. Unfortunately, two or three days of this doesn’t really compare to what some people go through on a daily basis.”
Of the more than 45 million people who use food stamps, 47 percent are children, according to the Department of Agriculture.
“It’s so easy for us to walk into a store and say, ‘That’s the kind of bread and peanut butter I want, because it’s better for me,’” said Sarah Young, a graduate student studying social work. “For so many people, though, that’s just not an option.”
Jason Lipeles, a coordinator of the Food Stamp Challenge, said that one of the toughest parts about living on food stamps is getting adequate nutrition.
“When I went shopping for the challenge, I noticed that because I was looking for cheap produce, it tended to be low quality,” Lipeles said. “There definitely wasn’t any organic produce.”
D’Andre Holland, GSG director of community service and special events, said she hopes the initiative will foster awareness and promote action among USC students.
“We still have a long way to go as far as poverty is concerned,” Holland said. “If we can throw food away every 10 to 20 minutes, why are so many people still hungry?”
Kevin Anderson, GSG vice president-elect, said GSG is planning other social awareness campaigns this semester.
This is an important and ongoing crisis in many cities across the nation. Bringing home to the USC community is a wonderful and conscious responsibility. I would like to point out that there are conscious Staff members at USC  who are very much involved in the Food Challenge as well as Students and Faculty.
“45 million people who use food stamps”
It doesn’t take much effort to get food stamps. There aren’t much in the way of audits. If you are willing to lie, you can get tax dollars to support your food habit. Remember the news story a couple of months ago? One lotto winner would not give up food stamps. The food stamp administrators could not find a reason to discontinue a million dollar lotto winner. http://search.yahoo.com/r/_ylt=A0oGdSUc6npPJ10ACbdXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEybjB1dWc4BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMgRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0RGRDVfODg-/SIG=13p0evar4/EXP=1333484188/**http%3a//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43091952/ns/us_news-life/t/million-lottery-winner-still-gets-food-stamps/
Measuring food stamp recipients does not equal the number of people that would go hungry without them. There is a secondary market for food stamps where they trade at a discount. Don’t get me wrong, there are people that are truly in need, but on the backs of them are millions that are not in need and abuse the system and help create our trillion dollar deficits (nationally) and billion dollar budget problems (California)..

USC, in partnership with Autism Speaks U, lit the globe on top of the Von KleinSmid Center blue to recognize World Autism Awareness Day on Monday.
Cause · USC’s Autism Speaks U lit the Von KleinSmid Center globe blue on Monday in recognition of World Autism Awareness Day. - Gina Hazarian | Daily Trojan
Rachael Caulker, marketing chair for USC’s Autism Speaks U, said she hopes the event encourages students to inform themselves about autism.
“Light It Up Blue is a global event that seeks to shine a light on autism as a growing health problem,” Caulker said. “The VKC globe is notable, and our goal is to have people ask why it is blue and then build awareness that way.”
In its third year, Light It Up Blue encourages people to raise awareness about autism by lighting up buildings blue
USC Autism Speaks U, founded this year, is dedicated to funding global biomedical research for the prevention, treatments and cure for autism.  It is also committed to increasing public awareness and providing hope for those who suffer with the disorder, Caulker said.
“We want people to be aware and become educated about the early traits of autism,” Caulker said. “If you treat it early, it could be less severe because children can get the rigorous treatment and therapy they need at an early age,” Caulker said.
Autism is a developmental brain disorder that impairs one’s ability to communicate, form relationships and interact socially.
The Center for Disease Control recently reported that 1 in 88 children are affected by autism, and boys are four times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with the disease.
The study also reported that more children will be diagnosed with autism this year than those diagnosed with AIDS, diabetes and cancer combined. There is no current medical detection or cure for the disorder.

More than one year after being elected to Undergraduate Student Government, USG President Monish Tyagi and USG Vice President Logan Lachman have developed the rapport of a married couple.
“If you are spending this much time with someone, you either need to like them or you are going to kill them,” Lachman said. “We’ve gotten to the married couple point where we finish each other’s sentences, which happens to be very convenient for us.”
During their one-year term, Tyagi and Lachman have spent countless hours meeting with administrators, coordinating projects and overseeing the student government and Program Board.
“I may or may not have slept [in the office] a couple of times,” Tyagi said.
Tuesday marks the last day for Tyagi and Lachman’s tenure, the achievements of which have included creating the sustainability mug and extending the hours of Seeds in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Tyagi and Lachman, however, said many of their achievements have been less material. Tyagi said his administration has focused on fulfilling a campaign promise to build a stronger connection among USG, students and administrators. As the university makes changes in the coming years, Tyagi said he believes this relationship will enhance USG’s voice in future decisions.
“If everyone is on the same page, then I think student government will play a very important role in making sure that, as the university changes, things that students need or are concerned about are addressed,” Tyagi said.
Tyagi said he also believes more students are aware of USG and its impact than when his term began last spring.
“When we went through the elections for this year, at the debate, we saw a huge turnout,” Tyagi said. “And I think that has a lot to do with the fact that students were a lot more aware of USG and student government.”
The new administration, headed by Director of University Affairs Mikey Geragos and Residential Senator Vinnie Prasad, will be sworn in Tuesday night at a USG Senate meeting as president and vice president, respectively.
Lachman said the advice she would pass along to Geragos and Prasad is to fully immerse themselves in their positions.
“Have fun with it and take advantage of everything that you are doing [and] work hard throughout the whole year,” said Lachman. “It’s our last week and we are still in here, doing as much as we can.”
Tyagi, a senior majoring in cinema and television production, and Lachman, a junior majoring in communication, said that their USG positions have taught them a lot about leadership and interacting with people.
“I would say this is the best class you could take on leadership, ever,” Tyagi said.
Tyagi likened working as USG president to running a business.
“You have a $1.8-million budget,” he said. “You have to allocate it into different resources. You have to make sure people are doing their jobs and things are moving on time. I really enjoyed that whole process.”
Lachman said her USG work has influenced her decision to pursue leadership positions in the future.
“It has made me recognize that I do like being in a leadership position and I hope to continue some sort of leadership position, in another organization, or when I graduate,” Lachman said.
Tyagi and Lachman are unsure of what they will do with their free time after their tenures end Tuesday.
“I’m still president of Pi Phi so that will keep me somewhat busy, I guess,” Lachman said.
Tyagi said he looks forward to wearing casual clothes to school.
“I’m looking forward to a full week where I can come to school every day and not have to wear a suit one time,” Tyagi said.
I hope the student body is happy that it’s paid those two $10k and $8k respectively to get to the married couple point because that’s the only thing they’ve been doing.  “Their achievments have been less material”? Yea, their achievements are pretty much fictional.

Program Board confirmed that electronic artist Wolfgang Gartner will headline Springfest, a daylong music festival for USC students, faculty and staff, on Saturday in McCarthy Quad. Thirteen other acts will also perform, including Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Anberlin.
Alyssa Siegel, director of Program Board’s concert committee, said this is the first time USC has had an electronic act at Springfest. Wolfgang Gartner’s first full-length album, Weekend in America, was released in September and includes vocals from will.i.am, Jim Jones and Eve.
“I’m just really excited to see the reaction to the headliner and how the whole day will go,” Siegel said.
Though Wolfgang Gartner was confirmed two months ago, Siegel said the contract was not finalized until Monday.
Siegel said the committee sought to create a lineup that appealed to all students, whether they listen to rock, hip hop or dance.
“My biggest thing is we wanted to find three major acts that would cover the genres popular for college kids,” Siegel said. “I wanted to hit every genre, so everyone on campus would like something.”
Two student bands, Alphabet and Felix Nobody, will also perform at the festival. Both acts won the Battle of the Bands earlier this semester.
Springfest, which begins at noon, will feature student activities, such as DJ instruction, vinyl painting, a photo booth and art pillars.
“This year, we really wanted people to go to the festival and spend the whole day there,” Siegel said. “We really tried to think of what was going to be there to keep people there all day.”
Funding for Springfest, a free event for USC students, comes from the student-programming fee, sponsorships and a reallocation of student government funds.
I’m sorry, but who the hell is this? I’m no electronic music fan, but I know my fair share of popular electronic artists and I’ve never heard of this guy. What a waste of school money.
And all this lineup appeals to are culturally uneducated freshman who listen to nothing but KROQ and Skrillex. Also, Anberlin? I’m sorry, is this 2004?
The Program Board has put on concerts with outdated and irrelevant “artists” for years. It’s about time they put their heads together and start picking artists that weren’t big 10 years ago.
Negative Nancy, 
Be slow to judge and quick to listen. Wolfgang Gartner, previously known as Joey Youngman, has been producing house music for more than a decade. He was well known in the Deep and Chicago House scene a while ago, and his transition into Electro House is what made him famous. In fact, he is totally awesome. You should check out his work! And if you don’t like him, well heck, that’s what is so awesome about human beings. We are all unique!
Much love! Keep your heart and ears open.

Radnor said the reason the show is enjoyable for the audience and for himself is that the actors genuinely take pleasure in working with each other.
“I guess we do laugh a lot during the day, and I don’t know a lot of people who can say that about their work place,” Radnor said. “If I wasn’t in How I Met Your Mother, I’d probably be a fan of the show.”
Radnor said that in addition to his role on How I Met Your Mother, he has enjoyed directing movies and has so far directed two films. Radnor’s latest film Liberal Arts appeared at Sundance Film Festival in January and his film Happythankyoumoreplease was shown in theaters in March 2011.
Radnor said after How I Met Your Mother has finished, he expects to return to theater, in addition to writing, directing and acting in movies.
“[Theater’s] probably my favorite form of acting,” Radnor said. “I always play this game in my head whether I want to act or direct or write, and I actually like all of it, but I’d like to direct a movie that I’m not in, because I’m in both of my first two movies.”
As for the future of How I Met Your Mother, Radnor said he couldn’t reveal much, but that the series will be continuing for a while longer.
“At least one more year, but I’m not sure beyond that,” Radnor said.
Deborah Liu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she was looking forward to seeing Radnor speak, because she enjoys Radnor’s show.
“I’ve watched every episode of [How I Met Your Mother], so I was really excited to see him in person and to hear him speak,” Liu said. “It was great to see that he was just as funny in person as he is in his show, and I can’t wait for more of his [television] shows and movies.”

Though her career with the Women of Troy is over, USC senior guard Ashley Corral has not stopped stroking the three ball.
Corral claimed the State Farm College 3-Point Championship among a field of eight competitors at the Final Four in New Orleans on Thursday.
As USC’s all-time leader in 3-pointers made, Corral fought through three rounds en route to a 20-11 victory over Louisville’s Becky Burke in the final round on live television.
Sharp shooter · Senior guard Ashley Corral is USC’s all-time leader in 3-point baskets made in USC history, with 292 in the book. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
In the championship round, Corral nailed four of five shots in the last rack to tie her first round score of 20.
She was visibly pumped up throughout the competition, yelling “Let’s go!” to the buzzing crowd after hitting eight of her last 10 shots in the first round.
After taking the women’s crown, Corral took on the men’s champion, John Shurna of Northwestern. Shurna came out on top, 24-14.
At USC, Corral has 292 career 3-pointers in the book, which is the  most all-time at USC and second all-time in the Pac-12 Conference.
She also has 466 assists, good for third all-time with the Women of Troy.
After averaging a team-high 12.7 points per game in conference play and hitting 69 shots from beyond the arc, Corral was selected to the All-Pac-12 team for the third consecutive year.
Despite holding the third seed in the conference, the Women of Troy fell to Washington State in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament and missed the cut for the NCAA Tournament and the Women’s National Invitation Tournament this year.

After going 1-1 against the Cougars before getting snowed out of the third game in a three-game series at Washington State (13-11, 3-5) on Sunday, the USC baseball team returns home to Dedeaux Field to face Pepperdine tonight.
Heading to Pullman, Wash., on Friday, the Trojans (16-9, 3-5) were looking to improve on their Pac-12 record and move up in the standings.
In the first game of the series, the Trojans pulled out a victory thanks to an eight-run ninth-inning rally in which the team came from three runs behind to win 15-10. The Cougars and Trojans exchanged the lead several times, going up 1-0 with an RBI single from senior catcher Kevin Roundtree in the top of the first inning.
The Huskies answered in the bottom of the inning with an RBI single from outfielder Derek Jones. By the fourth inning, Washington State held a 5-1 lead after senior starting pitcher Andrew Triggs gave up an RBI double, a two-run home run and threw a run-scoring wild pitch. Triggs left the game after 5 2/3 innings.
But in the sixth inning, both teams unleashed an offensive onslaught.
Facing reliever Scott Simon, the Trojans scored five runs on six hits, including an RBI single by senior first baseman Matt Foat. But USC’s 6-5 lead didn’t last as the Cougars answered with five runs in the bottom of the same inning.
“We were in that unfortunate position because we didn’t play well,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “We should have been in control.”
The Trojans chalked up one more run off an RBI single by sophomore designated hitter Jake Hernandez in the seventh inning, but they saved their serious comeback arsenal for the final inning when they were trailing 10-7. After Hernandez hit another RBI single to make it 10-8, USC loaded the bases with two outs, bringing junior third baseman Adam Landecker to the plate. Landecker came through in the clutch with a game-tying two-run single straight up the middle.
USC went on to score five more runs — all with two outs. Huskies pitcher Richie Ochoa issued a bases-loaded walk to Foat, freshman second baseman Dante Flores emptied the bases with a three-run double and sophomore left-fielder Kevin Swick hit a double to score Flores from second.
“It just showed what kind of team our team is,” Cruz said. “They never give up, they continue to fight.”
The second game of the series proved less fulfilling, as the Trojans lost 9-7 on Saturday. Senior starter Ben Mount pitched two innings, giving up four runs in the first and one more in the second. Mount left at the beginning of the third inning after getting hit in the knee by a line drive off the bat of third baseman Patrick Claussen.
Cruz said an MRI test was negative on Mount’s knee and he should be back pitching this week.
USC attempted to come back from a 5-0 deficit in the third inning, with Hernandez and Roundtree each chipping in                         run-scoring hits to cut the Huskies’ lead to two runs. Junior pitcher Matt Munson pitched 3 2/3 innings of strong relief and the Trojans fought back to take the lead 6-5 until the seventh inning when catcher P.J. Jones hit a game-tying RBI single.
The Trojans scored another run in the eighth inning, but the Cougars capitalized off of a throwing error by Flores in the bottom of the inning that allowed the tying run to score. Jones hit a go-ahead RBI single, followed by another run-scoring single from center fielder Jason Monda, and the Trojans were unable to repeat the ninth-inning excitement they had shown Friday.
[Correction: An earlier version misnamed Washington State as the Huskies. They are the Cougars. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.]
Because of snowy conditions, Sunday’s game was postponed until sometime later this season.
Tonight, USC faces the Pepperdine Waves (17-11), a team coming off a tough 14-3 loss Sunday against another Washington school, Gonzaga. Going into the game, Cruz said he’s having the team focus on the basics.
“We’re again trying to have a priority on fielding routine ground balls, trying to execute offensively and our bunting game. Our team has great continuity,” Cruz said. “I’m just trying to get our team to play better. It’s important that we play fundamental baseball. We can’t worry about the standings, [we] have to worry about playing better.”
Game time is set for 6 p.m. After its game against the Waves, USC will head into a three-game home series against California beginning on Thursday night. The Bears are 1-5 in Pac-12 play with 16-10 record overall.
Please at least know the mascot name of the school you are reporting as a member of the Pac-12. Washington St. is nicknamed the Cougars not Huskies which is UW. How can you report on sports not even aware of the basics.

For the second time this season, USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento earned Pac-12 Player of the Week.
Sarmiento, who is the third consecutive USC tennis player to earn the honor, captured two doubles victories and two straight-set singles wins for the No. 1 Trojans (21-0, 2-0) in their two-game road trip to kick off conference play.
Ranked No. 23 in the nation in singles, Sarmiento chalked up a 6-4, 6-3 win over Emmett Egger in the Trojans’ 7-0 win over No. 22 Washington in their Pac-12 opener last Friday.
Sarmiento topped Oregon’s Robin Cambier 6-0, 6-1 a day later for the team’s first singles win against the Ducks. His efforts helped USC garner another 7-0 sweep, which became USC coach Peter Smith’s 200th win with the Trojans. Sarmiento is now 14-3 in dual match singles and 29-8 overall, with four consecutive wins on record.
In doubles, Sarmiento paired up with senior Daniel Nguyen for an 8-2 win against the Huskies and an 8-3 victory against the Ducks. Together, the No. 18 duo in doubles, improved to 15-2 in dual matches and 20-4 overall for the season.
Sarmiento was the first Trojan to take Pac-12 Player of the Week honors on Jan. 30 and now has four career selections as Player of the Week. Seniors Nguyen and Steve Johnson and freshmen Roberto Quiroz and Yannick Hanfmann comprise the other USC men’s tennis players who have earned the honor this season.
After their successful conference opener, the Trojans will travel again for two road games against Utah (11-7, 0-2) on Friday at 12:30 p.m. and Arizona (5-12, 0-2) at 11 a.m. Saturday.

The USC football team has only two weeks remaining in spring practice. The Trojans are primed to take on any opponent even though they are months away from kickoff. Many questions, however, still surround USC’s roster.
Big man · The Trojans hope redshirt junior Kevin Graf (center) will fill the void left by offensive tackle Matt Kalil, who entered this year’s NFL draft. Graf played left tackle at Agoura Hills High School. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Spring practice has not been the easiest transition for the USC football program. Injuries, transfers and multi-sport athletes have hampered progress during spring practice. Despite a few roadblocks, the Trojans have made drastic changes to its roster.
Most recently, sophomore Tre Madden made the switch from linebacker to running back. Madden played backup strong side linebacker for the Trojans during his freshman season in 2011. Appearing in 12 games with one start (at Colorado), Madden totaled 15 tackles. His performance thus far during spring practice sessions has created a lot of buzz and received praise from coach Lane Kiffin.
Madden is not the only Trojan to switch positions during spring football. Much of the shake-up has occurred within two of the most crucial pieces of the Trojan puzzle — the offensive and defensive lines.
The departure of left tackle Matt Kalil for the NFL draft has left a gaping hole in the USC offensive line. The Trojans have turned to redshirt junior right tackle Kevin Graf to make the switch to the left side. Graf will ultimately have the most important role this season, as he will be protecting senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s blind side. The switch will not be too drastic for Graf as he logged experience playing left tackle in high school.
Because of Graf moving to fill Kalil’s former role, sophomore Aundrey Walker will move to right tackle. Walker served as a backup tackle and was influential on special teams during the 2011 season. Though Walker is still adjusting to playing right tackle, it is rumored that he might switch with Graf once more, if needed. Unless the most drastic situation occurs, however, the notion of switching Graf and Walker again would be truly foolish.
The Trojan defense line will have new faces in the mix in order to fill the three necessary spots vacated by Nick Perry, Christian Tupou and DaJohn Harris. USC fans will not be surprised to see Wes Horton, Devon Kennard, George Uko and J.R. Tavai starting on the defensive line this fall. All have been instrumental to the potent USC defense during their time at USC. Younger players, however, such as Antwaun Woods, are looking to make their mark and earn one of the coveted starting positions.
Despite the three vacancies, the Trojan defensive line will be strong regardless of the combination decided at the conclusion of spring and fall practices.
With all the talk of position rotations within the corps of the offensive and defensive lines, it is only fair to question whether it is reasonable to switch veteran players in order to accommodate the younger players on the team.
Absolutely.
Now is the time to make necessary roster adjustments before fall camp and the imminent 2012 season. By seeing which players excel at particular positions or who` might be a better fit at another, it strengthens the program greatly. The roster adjustments can also influence off-field behaviors as well. Players like Graf are taking over leadership positions that can help ignite not only the offense but the defense as well in crucial   game-time scenarios.
In addition, the veteran players are more adjusted to the offensive and or defensive schemes. They know what is expected and can make the switch easier as opposed to a player who is still relatively new to the USC football program. The USC Trojans need to take advantage of every second of spring practice to refine and polish skills, settling them into a prime position for fall camp.
Position changes might be puzzling since only two weeks remain in spring ball, but have no fear the Trojans are still on track.

The No. 6 USC women’s rowing team won its fourth Jessop-Whittier Cup in school history and second straight at the San Diego Crew Classic.
It was the first time in USC history that the Women of Troy won back-to-back Jessop-Whittier Cups. USC qualified all three varsity boats for the grand final.

USC’s efforts were led by the varsity eight, which finished its race in 7:03.93.
The Women of Troy never trailed in the race, finishing a boat length ahead of No. 1 Virginia, No. 8 Washington, No. 2 California, UCLA and No. 5 Stanford.
USC’s second varsity eight was hindered by its position in lane 6, having to deal with cross winds and an outgoing tide.
The boat took sixth place, falling behind UCLA, Washington, Virginia, Stanford and California.
USC’s second varsity four won its third final, finishing 11 seconds in front of Stanford. The novice eight took third in the petite final and ninth overall.
USC’s varsity four boat, which competed in the last grand final at the event, also encountered the same problems as the second varsity eight in lane 6, finishing fifth behind Virginia, Washington State, UCLA and Tennessee.
The Women of Troy will next compete at Carnegie Lake in Princeton, N.J., on April 14 against Princeton and Yale.

Any talk relating to the politics of representation in the media generally focuses on a handful of characteristics that a person would have from birth. Race and sexual orientation in particular are the cause of the lion’s share of hand-wringing over representational issues: Are minorities underrepresented in How I Met Your Mother, for instance, or do shows on the Fox network feature an adequate number of LGBT-related plotlines?

The fairness of mandating the inclusion of certain types of characters or storylines in what could be considered someone else’s art is obviously up for discussion. Nonetheless, there are a number of watchdog organizations already in place, such as the Paley Center for Media and the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, that vigilantly monitor the television landscape and are forever poised to call out any network that falls short of standards that networks are under no legal obligation to meet.
Socioeconomic status is obviously not a natural-born characteristic, but there’s no denying that the circumstances of a person’s birth and their parents’ financial situation directly influence the opportunities available to them and, in effect, their own future finances.
Even though socioeconomic status isn’t genetic, for many people, money figures very prominently into their fundamental self-image. In many cases, relative wealth surely trumps other components of a person’s identity, such as ethnicity: If you’re struggling to put food on the table, would you spend more time thinking about the country that your ancestors came from, or where your next meal is going to come from?
For that reason, it seems strange that representations of people with different financial situations on TV aren’t scrutinized nearly as fiercely as representations of other identities. On one end of the wealth spectrum — and you can probably guess which — GLAAD-style monitoring is hardly necessary; on the other end, representations are markedly fewer and farther between, but most are genuinely engaging and compelling.
Astronomical wealth is the common province  of TV. Teen soaps like Gossip Girl, The O.C. and 90210 have made names for themselves by trafficking in the glamorous lives of beautiful and fabulously wealthy young people for whom money is no object.
Setting aside their aims of intrigue and humor for a moment, Revenge and the late Entourage similarly rely on the fascination of the unfamiliar to lure in audiences. Offering small screen glimpses into worlds that most viewers would never otherwise be privy to — the high-society summer crowd of the Hamptons and the fast-paced and high-stakes world of the Hollywood elite, respectively — certainly accounts for at least part of their programs’ appeal.
But financial voyeurism only goes so far. TV viewers will probably always be interested in seeing how the other half lives at least to some extent, but the problems that the wealthy characters in these shows contend with are largely manufactured, ranging from inconsequential first-world problems to hyperbolic life-or-death scenarios that are too melodramatic to be engaging. This is not to say that the rich don’t have real problems; they’re just not being shown on TV.
To find higher stakes, look to the lower class. As any TV writer worth her salt knows, money is a great source of tension — making it all the more curious that economic hardship isn’t portrayed more often on television.
Shows that do address the financial struggles plaguing millions of Americans are as different in execution as they are similar in subject, but many of them are proven successes.
CBS heralds its 2 Broke Girls as America’s “#1 New Comedy,” but that might be more a testament to the power of the CBS machine than the quality of the program’s jokes or writing.
In 2 Broke Girls, the nods to financial hardship are timely — the formerly wealthy Caroline Channing (Beth Behrs) goes from trust fund princess to diner waitress in a matter of days with the revelation of her father’s involvement in Bernie Madoff-like skullduggery — and the show’s engagement with the concept of poverty is fairly superficial, simply enabling the show to move from one plot point to the next.
HBO recently let How To Make It In America die after two eight-episode seasons, but Lena Dunham and Judd Apatow’s highly anticipated Girls looks poised to cover a lot of overlapping territory — namely, struggling to make money and find place as a 20-something-year-old in New York City.
AMC’s Breaking Bad, widely regarded as the best show on television, confronts the real-world implications of our current hard times as they impact the White family in Albuquerque, N.M. Bryan Cranston’s Walter White begins the series as a high school chemistry teacher driven to the manufacture of illicit drugs by financial desperation — for Walter, cooking meth appears to be the only way he can cover the medical expenses incurred in the wake of his diagnosis with lung cancer in the pilot.
Breaking Bad is unflinching in its engagement with the realities of poverty in the U.S., something that Showtime’s boozed-up Shameless also successfully achieves, although with a decisively more light-hearted tone. Fiona Gallagher (Emmy Rossum) does a lot of things to provide for her brood of younger siblings that she probably wouldn’t otherwise.
Audience interest in portrayals of wealth for reasons of pure spectacle are well understood, but networks seem to be catching on to the fact that audiences have problems of their own, and many of them are money-related.

Los Angeles’ own Young Money rapper Tyga performed for a sold-out crowd at Club Nokia at L.A. Live on Sunday night, bringing more than enough energy to keep his hometown fans — including some who waited as much as two hours in line for the show — excited.
Tyga’s “Careless World Tour” — named for his latest album Careless World: Rise of the Last King — is making stops in 41 cities across the U.S., and the L.A. show was hotly anticipated. Though Tyga’s homecoming had fans anxious and ready, the biggest surprise for the crowd, however, might have happened before Tyga even touched the stage.

There were several opening acts for this particular show. The opening artists, who performed between two to six songs, included hip-hop young guns YG, Joe Moses, Kid Ink and Lil Twist, another member of Young Money.
Most notably, during one of Lil Twist’s songs (which was not receiving a particularly great reaction from the crowd), everyone jumped up to their feet, screaming in awe.
Justin Bieber, one of Lil Twist’s good friends, who happened to be in town to attend the Kids’ Choice Awards at the Galen Center, had just run onto the stage to help hype up the crowd during the song. Though he didn’t do much other than run across the stage saying things like “let’s go” and “yeah” for a little less than a minute, it definitely caught everyone’s attention.
Once Bieber fever cooled down and all the openers finished, Tyga finally took the stage decked out in a fur jacket, shirt and hat flaunting his brand, Last Kings. Backed by large lighted letters spelling out his name and fog machines galore, Tyga came out blazing, quickly jumping into his extensive song catalog; having released five mixtapes and a full-length album since 2010, the selection of songs was pretty deep.
His first few songs consisted of mixtape hits like “B-tch I’m The Sh-t,” “I’m So Raw” and his freestyle to Cali Swag District’s “Teach Me How To Dougie,” along with a single from the compilation album We Are Young Money titled “Roger That.”
About a quarter of the way through the show, he brought out opening act YG again, this time to join him for two songs. YG’s presence along with Tyga’s on the stage got the crowd going. Tyga followed this up by slowing down the pace, working in songs from his newest album and including a sincere performance of “I’m Gone” and eliciting a very positive crowd response with the song “Muthaf-cka Up.”
Finishing his Careless World album songs, Tyga pumped up the crowd by bringing out a new artist on his Last Kings label: female rapper Honey Cocaine. The duo excelled on its song “Heisman,” and Honey Cocaine performed well enough on her solo song to keep fans intrigued, even though many probably had not been exposed to her music yet.
Surprisingly, the most entertaining and impressive part of the night was not saved for last.
The highlight came when Tyga performed three hit songs one after another: “Faded,” “The Motto” and “Rack City.” The crowd knew almost every word, singing and rapping the lyrics as loud as possible, and Tyga was physically and vocally more energized during those songs.
Tyga also showed off his humorous side, commenting after performing “BedRock” that he usually has girls throwing their bras onstage at this point. His words almost immediately prompted three or four girls to do so, and Tyga went even further, flirtatiously singling out a tan-colored bra for its robust size.
Fan interaction was a heavy aspect of the concert, and Tyga kept that theme for his final songs, following up “Deuces” and “Far Away” with an encore of the smash hit “Rack City” that also featured about 10 girls onstage with him — a fitting ending to a strong showing.
The concert proved that Tyga’s performance skills are very good, but having such a huge repertoire might actually have hurt the young rapper’s ability to put on a great show: With so many songs and only few that stand out as popular or well-known, fans coming to the show might not really know what to expect.
Despite this, Tyga kept the energy up throughout and played to the crowd, warmly stopping to tell the crowd how much he loves and appreciates the fan support from his hometown. Considering that the audience had a great time, there’s no doubt that Tyga will always be welcome in Los Angeles.

Film noir meets musical theater in the USC School of Theatre’s City of Angels, which premiered at Bing Theater on Thursday. As audience members take their seats in a theater only miles away from Downtown Los Angeles, they are eased back in time to 1947 Los Angeles, where cigarettes, femme fetales and sardonic jokes are in fashion.
Period piece · Film noir and musical theatre combine to create the perfect artistic hybrid in USC’s City of Angels. The dramatic production imbues the direction of the respected, talented John Rubenstein but it is the ensemble that truly shines, leaving no single stand-out performer. - Photo courtesy Craig Schwartz
“Everyone’s in a movie,” jokes Allen Darby who plays a sleaze ball movie producer only concerned with making his next buck. “Sometimes we just turn the camera on.”
This quote properly sums up City of Angels, which, considering the double-nature of the show’s characters and the blending between life on-and off-screen, seems funny and appropriate.
City of Angels follows the story of successful fiction writer Stine (Matthew McFarland) who attempts to combine his literary freedom with the intellectually unconcerned, money-making agenda of the 1947 Hollywood industry.
As Stine reworks one of his novels into a screenplay under the controlling influence of movie mogul Buddy Fidler (Allen Darby), he is forced to come to terms with the decline of his personal relationships as well as his crumbling identity.
Against all of this is the “fictional” world of Stine’s creations, where private eye Stone (Cole Cuomo), whose wise cracks, cigarette smoking and charming way with women mark him as the Phillip Marlowe of the theater world, investigates a missing person’s case that quickly becomes a murder story. As Stine writes Stone’s story, the real and the imaginary merge until the audience can no longer tell what is true and what is fiction.
The show is long, running just over three hours with a 15-minute intermission. But it manages to hold attention, provoke laughter and eye-rolling, even as it incites suspense.
Though the production features the talented influence of director John Rubinstein, who originated the lead role in Pippin and has directed many popular musicals, such as Into the Woods and Guys and Dolls, the cast refuses to be overshadowed. Every performer delivers powerful solos and emotive performances, making it difficult to pinpoint one crowd favorite or show-stealer.
Notable talents are Cuomo and McFarland, who, though polar opposites in terms of vocal style, complement each other as the duo of creator and created. Cuomo’s resonant baritone chills during his solo numbers and voiceovers — even his ordinary dialogue is pleasant to listen to.  Lines like “Only the floor kept her legs from going on forever” have a certain ring in his deep tone of voice, turning the potentially cheesy into the comically appropriate.
Then there is McFarland’s tenor, which unabashedly soars to grasp sustained high notes. His frenetic energy carries him throughout tough numbers like “Funny” and “Double Talk,” and when he closes his eyes and belts out his final notes, viewers forget that they’re watching a performance.
The female leads are just as impressive. Though City of Angels features a series of likable but shallow female characters — they only seem to exist for the men around them — the USC actresses bring writer Larry Gelbart’s women to life. Alexandra Arthur’s fluid mezzo glides over high and low notes as Bobbi/Gabby, and Carrie St. Louis gives a flawless portrayal of the film-noir bombshell. Especially stunning is Amanda Holt as Oolie/Donna, whose rendition of “You Can Always Count on Me” is hilarious and vocally memorable.
Most of the cast members also double as characters in the real and fictional worlds, allowing the audience to clearly see the consistent emotional undercurrents between certain characters and understand where Stine gets his inspiration. This element of City of Angels provides food for thought for audience members who want to make connections between the show’s larger themes, and solid entertainment for those who just want to have a good time.
On top of the cast talent is the show’s slick production value, which makes use of a conveyor-belted stage to quickly make scene and set changes. Offices and hotel rooms slide on-and off-stage in a matter of seconds, reminding the audience of the quick scene jumps in the movie that City of Angels attempts to emulate. At one point in the show, a covered corpse on a gurney becomes a man getting a massage on a table — cute and effective.
The show’s design is also particularly exceptional. Specific detail is paid attention to costuming and props, and muted colors are used in the set design to emphasize the drab and usually grayscale coloring of noir films. If anything is historically inaccurate, the audience never questions it.
If not for the pleasant doubling of a show about Los Angeles performed on USC’s campus, it would be easy to see such a high-caliber production snagging a spot on Broadway or the West End.
At any rate, this college-level production remains a must-see.
 
City of Angels plays at the Bing Theater until April 7.

Ben Heckmann is much like any other aspiring writer. He had an idea he loved, wrote about it and got published.
Except Ben Heckmann is in the eighth grade, and his parents paid $400 to publish his two books about a fictional rock band.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The Sunday New York Times published an article titled “Young Writers Dazzle Publisher (Mom and Dad)” subtly criticizing a new trend: self-publishing by parents for their children.
But this criticism is unwarranted and misplaced. What’s more important is the good that this trend represents — open access and opportunity — as well as well as the bad: a growing culture of vanity.
The New York Times frames this story as any elite traditional institution would. It demeans Heckmann as nothing more than a 14-year-old aspiring writer and belittles the fame his books have garnered, along with the message he took away from self-publication.
“You can basically do anything if you put your mind to it,” Heckmann said.
Many famous writers and established publishing professionals were quoted in response.
“What’s next?” novelist Tom Robbins said. “Kiddie architects, juvenile dentists, 11-year-old rocket scientists? Any parent who thinks that the crafting of engrossing, meaningful, publishable fiction requires less talent and experience than designing a house, extracting a wisdom tooth or supervising a lunar probe is, frankly, delusional.”
If Robbins thinks that Heckmann’s parents, or anyone’s parents, are publishing their children’s work because they think their children are his professional equivalents, he’s delusional.
If children have their books published, it is not the end of the world. It doesn’t mean that the quality or integrity of the publishing and writing world is on the decline.
The larger trend at hand has both good and bad aspects to it, but the bad is nowhere near what Robbins points to.
Self-publishing allows college students like us to chase our dreams much sooner than members of older generations could. It is slowly tearing down traditional walls that have long been a part of many professional worlds — especially those that revolve around writing, such as publishing and journalism.
Self-publishing, however, is also an indication of a vain culture, one that is so inundated with access and sharing that access is often assumed, and sharing results in sensory overload.
The generation below ours is even more digital than we are. The obsession we have today with all things online and the expectation of the possibilities the Internet will grant us is only going to grow.
I know we hear it all the time, but it’s true: We are the digital generation — of Facebook, of smartphones and of social media revolutions.
Self-publication is an incarnation of our age, and one of which we should be both proud and wary.

As college admissions become more competitive, can any high school students really afford to be well-rounded anymore?
Admission rates are sinking lower at many major universities. USC’s undergraduate admission rate dropped 4 percentage points this year.
As the number of applicants grows, more and more applicants look for ways to differentiate themselves from the masses. Faced with these odds, many parents hire college counselors and force their children to commit to countless extracurricular activities and to achieve perfect GPAs.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
But by exerting pressure to succeed in and outside of school, the college admissions process impedes the development of healthy, well-rounded human beings — the kind of students they supposedly seek.
In a recent email sent out to USC Ambassadors, President C. L. Max Nikias touted some of the amazing statistics of USC’s incoming freshman class. USC received around 45,000 applications for 2,600 spots.
Nikias followed the passage with this statement: “This may surprise you: USC’s freshman class contains nearly three times as many Caltech-caliber students as Caltech itself. After all, Caltech has approximately 200 students with almost perfect GPAs and SAT scores, while USC has 550 students of exactly the same quality.”
Nikias goes on to state that this competitiveness “allows us to build the most broadly talented undergraduate population in the world.”
In addition to these “Caltech-caliber” students, USC also admits many amazing creative and performing arts students.
But is there a place at USC — or even an admissions spot — for a person who is truly well-rounded?
Amazing artistic talent and a perfect GPA seem to be two tickets into USC, but most people don’t have either. This fact alone doesn’t make them any less deserving of a USC education.
College recruiting is also on the rise. In the same email, Nikias outlines how “successes have come from a proactive and aggressive approach to high school recruiting. In 2004, USC representatives personally visited 380 high schools per year. Today, we visit more than 2,000 schools!”
This marked increase in high school recruiting only feeds into the hyper-competitive nature of college admissions.
To stop feeding this trend, colleges need to move away from using strict standards like SAT scores and move to looking at candidates on a case-by-case basis.
Obviously, looking at candidates more holistically would require a lot more work than most colleges currently put into potential applicants; most likely, many applicants are automatically eliminated because of factors such as lower SAT scores.
But the SAT is a test that only measures one type of intelligence: reasoning. Another type of test needs to be developed that can measure more creative aptitudes.
If a perfect SAT score is a ticket into college, students will obviously work toward it. A student might then neglect skills in other areas to better prepare for this test.
Are these the kinds of students we want to be creating?
A well-rounded person might be good at many things, but not amazing at any one thing.
This person might be a great human being without the ability to get a perfect SAT score. And the SAT certainly doesn’t measure qualities such as honesty and maturity.
Nikias is extremely proud of our university and our students, and he should be.  USC is an amazing school. But couldn’t Nikias, who has spearheaded so many other changes at USC, encourage admissions to begin shifting away from hard numbers and more toward admitting good human beings?
It’s definitely hard to evaluate character by looking at a college application. Nevertheless, colleges need to measure more than just reading comprehension and math.
Nikias should lead the charge on a shift toward admitting well-rounded people, not just “Caltech-caliber” students.

Tim, you hit the nail on the head with this article. My son is one of the well rounded kids you wrote about. USC let a good one get away. USC is the big loser in this story. Another University scooped him up right away
Sorry Mr. Hughes, sounds like sour grapes. USC isn’t desperate by “scooping up” students who aren’t academically competitive. “Well rounded” sounds like the sympathy card for students with lower stats. 
SC needs more “Caltech caliber” students so to shed SC’s past image of “party school,” or, just a “football school but not academics” as our neighbors across town put it…after a 50-0 drubbing.

The administration should create bike paths on campus. 
Biking is the fastest way to get to class at USC. Many of us bike down Ellendale Place, turn left on Jefferson Boulevard and bike across the intersection at McClintock Avenue. Do you wonder if there are police waiting to give you a ticket for riding your bike? Well, you shouldn’t, because you are doing nothing wrong.
Instead of banning bikes at USC, the university should focus its time and resources on regulating congested intersections.
So many USC students bike because it is a safe, quick, easy and inexpensive way for students to navigate to, from and around USC’s campus. USC should install more bike racks and paved bike paths on campus to further promote students getting to class on time while engaging in athletic activity.
If sufficient, safe and considerate accommodations were made for bikers, they would use them instead of taking over sidewalks and intersections and making them unsafe for pedestrians. But because so many USC students bike to class, pedestrians have to dodge speeding bikes everywhere. Even though DPS has set up safe zones in areas where bicycle and pedestrian traffic is heavy, these zones only divert congestion to less crowded areas. They also slow down students and aren’t always enforced.
It’s not fair to students when people can ignore the safety zones, not walk their bikes — or skateboards — and peddle by fast enough to get away with it. Most bikers try to use alternate paths to divert these safe zones (i.e. cutting through parking lots).
Some argue that USC’s longstanding bike problem won’t go away unless bikes vanish completely. If bicycles were banned from USC’s campus there would be no more weaving through pedestrians, dodging safe zones or messy collisions.
Though banning bikes might solve USC’s bike problems, it would also create many more problems for students. I live far from campus and biking is the most realistic and logical way for me to get to school on time on a daily basis. Driving to school would take twice as long, parking would be expensive and it’s not the most eco-friendly means of transportation.
USC needs to create paths and bike racks for bikers instead of finding ways to take away the privilege completely. If there were designated paved bike paths separate from walkways, there would be less danger, traffic and congestion on campus.

You know that sinking feeling you get when you log onto USC’s Web Registration, scroll to the course you really want to take and realize that there are no open spots?
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Though USC students might face this problem from time to time, it’s a common reality for students enrolled in California’s community colleges.
According to the The New York Times, California’s community college system has been hit particularly hard, losing $809 million in state aid since 2008. These massive budget cuts have hurt the number and quality of courses offered on public campuses throughout the state, where students fight to get the courses they need to graduate or transfer to their dream school.
Santa Monica College is one of the many schools feeling the harsh effect of budget cuts. The community college had to slash an alarming 1,100 courses in the fall.
To cope with this dilemma, the college plans on implementing a two-tiered tuition structure. The school hopes that students who are eager enough to register for a certain class will pay a higher price of $180 per hour, a significant markup from $36 per hour for regular classes.
SMC’s method of dealing with low funding is too drastic. Finding a solution to California’s massive budget cuts is far from easy, but students shouldn’t be punished for the state’s mistakes.
USC itself is a dream destination for many community college students. Of the 2011 transfer class, a notable 59 percent came from California community colleges.
Of those community colleges, SMC sends a significant proportion of students to USC. In fall 2009, 905 students applied to USC, of which 329 students were admitted and 173 enrolled, posting a 52 percent matriculation rate.
A chief reason students attend community college before applying to a more expensive four-year college like USC is to save money. Pricier courses would undermine the true purpose of community colleges: providing accessible and affordable options to students from all backgrounds.
Gov. Jerry Brown is hoping to solve the problem with a tax-hike initiative, which will raise levies on upper incomes and hike the state sales tax. According to a March USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, California voters mainly support Brown’s new proposal.
The fact that citizens are in favor of a tax hike illustrates widespread recognition of the severity of the situation. Students, school administrators and citizens across the state should support the tax initiative on November’s ballot, as it is one of the most straightforward and essential solutions to mending California’s budget crisis.
In addition, the government needs to be held accountable for the effective allocation of funds in education. Better transparency and performance-based budgeting at the state and local levels could drastically improve how public colleges operate.
The Government Performance and Accountability Act proposed by the California Forward Action Fund is a great example of what could be done to improve the state’s policymaking system.
The act requires state and local governments to identify funding before they create new programs and implement tax cuts. It also proposes to make legislation public three days before legislators cast their votes. If voters approve the act, it will push state and local governments to exercise greater fiscal responsibility.
Meanwhile, colleges should also implement some changes on their own — changes that don’t privilege students who can pay more.
One solution suggested by Clayton M. Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Michael B. Horn, the co-founder and Executive Director of Education at Innosight, were online classes. Christensen and Horn argue that online classes reduce teacher-to-student ratios in buildings, spread costs and ultimately help trim down expenses.
As California’s state and community colleges continue to reel from budget cuts, demand from students is only continuing to grow. Alternative solutions should be fully explored and change must be effected at the top and through our own engagement.

Program Board confirmed that electronic artist Wolfgang Gartner will headline Springfest, a daylong music festival for USC students, faculty and staff, Saturday in McCarthy Quad. Thirteen other acts will also perform, including Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Anberlin.
Alyssa Siegel, director of Program Board’s concert committee, said this is the first time USC has had an electronic act at Springfest. Wolfgang Gartner’s first full-length album, Weekend in America, was released in September and includes vocals from will.i.am, Jim Jones and Eve.
“I’m just really excited to see the reaction to the headliner and how the whole day will go,” Siegel said.
Though Wolfgang Gartner was confirmed two months ago, Siegel said the contract was not finalized until Monday.
Siegel said the committee sought to create a lineup that appealed to all students, whether they listen to rock, hip-hop or dance.
“My biggest thing is we wanted to find three major acts that would cover the genres popular for college kids,” Siegel said. “I wanted to hit every genre, so everyone on campus would like something.”
Two student bands, Alphabet and Felix Nobody, will also perform at the festival. Both acts won the Battle of the Bands earlier this semester.
Springfest, which begins at noon, will feature activities for students, such as DJ instruction, vinyl painting, a photo booth and art pillars.
“This year, we really wanted people to go to the festival and spend the whole day there,” Siegel said. “We really tried to think of what was going to be there to keep people there all day.”
Funding for Springfest, a free event for USC students, comes from the student-programming fee, sponsorships and a reallocation of student government funds.
 
The Lineup:
Aaron Childs
James Supercave
Jonny Come Lately
Davis Fetter
House Fire
Black Crystal Wolf Kids
Beware of Darkness
Alphabet
Felix Nobody 
Monsters Calling Home
Young London
Anberlin
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis
Wolfgang Gartner

Finally we got a decent performer for Springfest! So excited, is there an estimated time as to when Wolfgang Gartner will perform?

Following its first tournament victory of the season, the USC women’s golf team was unable to replicate its success this weekend, finishing tied for fifth place on Sunday at the PING/ASU Invitational in Tempe, Ariz.
Rival UCLA won the tournament by a commanding 12 strokes, finishing with an overall score of 5-over 857. Host Arizona State finished second at 17-over 869, while Texas A&M finished third at 21-over 873. The Women of Troy, ranked third in the nation, tied with UC Davis at 29-over 881.
“The finish is disappointing, especially considering the fact that we won the last tournament,” sophomore Sophia Popov said.
The team started slowly Friday, coming in tied for seventh at 289 after the first round. Senior Inah Park, who has notched two Top-16 finishes in her last three tournaments, shot par 71 to lead the Women of Troy at 13th. Rising freshman Doris Chen, coming off three consecutive Top 10 finishes, tied for 22nd at 1-over 72 with the help of two birdies on the front nine. Sophomore Sophia Popov and senior Lisa McCloskey each recorded three birdies and shot 2-over 73 to tie for 37th. Sophomore Rachel Morris tied for 69th at 6-over 77.
The final two rounds proved troublesome for the Women of Troy, who were unable to crack the top 3. After slipping to 3-over 74 on the second round, McCloskey surged to 2-under 69 Sunday, finishing 10th overall at 216. Chen maintained her consistency, shooting 2-over 73 on Saturday and 1-over 72 Sunday to tie for 11th at 217.
Park, who led the team after one round, struggled to maintain her standing, shooting 5-over 76 and then 8-over 79 in the final round to finish tied for 46th at 226. Morris finished tied for 73rd at 232, notching 5-over 76 on Saturday before shooting 8-over 79 in the final round.
Popov, who captured her fourth individual victory during the last tournament, struggled to a 10-over 81 on the second round before finishing strongly at 2-over 73 in the final round, bringing her to 51st. The finish was disappointing for Popov, who was looking to add to her momentum from the previous tournament.
The season has been rather inconsistent for the Women of Troy, who have struggled to repeat their success from last season. After winning four tournaments and receiving numerous accolades, the team has only captured one tournament victory thus far, but is still ranked high nationally and is optimistic about the end of the season.
“Last tournament, we played very solid golf and didn’t give shots away. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get it done as a team, but it was good to be in the hunt and now we know what we need to work on to try and win the next one,” Popov said.
The Women of Troy will be off until April 16th, when they participate in the two-day Pacific Coast Intercollegiate at Half Moon Bay. Following that, the team will gear up for the 2012 Pac-12 Championships, which will take place April 27th-29th in Pullman, Washington.

On top of their two victories over Pac-12 opponents, the Women of Troy celebrated coach Richard Gallien’s 300th win as the leading man of USC’s women tennis team this weekend at Marks Stadium.
After taking down the Oregon Ducks on Friday, the Women of Troy showed their affection for Gallien by dumping a tub of Gatorade on him at the conclusion of their 7-0 victory. Now in his 17th season at the helm, Gallien has enjoyed an illustrious tenure at USC and has accumulated a 301-127 record during his time here.
In the actual match against the Ducks, the Women of Troy saw their top doubles team, the second-ranked pairing of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria, drop their game on court 1, 8-7 (4). Luckily enough, the veteran duo of junior Danielle Lao and senior Alison Ramos won their match 8-3 as did the No. 52-ranked team of freshman Zoe Scandalis and junior Valeria Pulido.
With the doubles point in hand, USC began to exert their dominance over the match as singles rolled around. Just as they have all season long, courts four and five started the show for the Women of Troy. Christian jumped all over Oregon’s Pascale Neubert to take the match 6-1, 6-1 in the fourth slot and freshman Gabriella DeSimone, who recently won Pac-12 Player of the Week after two game-deciding victories, took care of Rabea Stueckemann on court five.
The 36th-ranked Santamaria shut down any hope that the Ducks had of a comeback with a decisive victory on court three as the freshman once again showed her chops in finishes game and in pressure situations.
The Women of Troy then turned their sights to Saturday where they faced off against the No. 22 Washington Huskies.
Despite a rain delay, which cut through the middle of the doubles’ display, the Women of Troy were able to keep their momentum from Friday as they plowed through the Huskies en route to their fourth straight shutout victory and seventh straight win overall.
Running their record to 16-2 — not to mention their undefeated conference record (5-0) — USC handled a Washington team that sits among the top 50 teams nationally.
Lead by Lao, the Women of Troy got off to a strong start after easily taking the doubles point to begin the day. After Lao recorded the first singles point because of Samantha Smith retiring down 5-0, USC didn’t take their foot off the pedal.
Santamaria stretched the lead out to 3-0 after thoroughly dismantling Capucine Gregoire on court three, earning her second victory of the weekend, followed by a game-ending win in fourth singles by none other then Christian.
The Women of Troy will look to keep their undefeated streak alive for another week. Staying home this weekend, USC has Arizona and Arizona State on tap at Marks Stadium in another double dose of Pac-12 conference play. With games against perennial powers Cal and Stanford on the horizon, the Women fo Troy need to make every win count if they want to keep their place at the top of the Pac-12.

On the off chance I’m listening to the radio, it’s likely that most of what I’m getting is nothing more than background noise. There is one station that stands out among the rest for superior musical taste. KCRW (89.9 FM) always plays good music, so much so that my standards for “good” are constantly being nudged higher and higher every time I tune in. Even when listening to KCRW though, it’s easy for the mind to stray and the music to fall upon deaf ears.
One track that I heard recently on the station however, grabbed me by the ear and dragged me towards one of my new favorite musical projects. It was called “I’ll Keep My Light in My Window” courtesy of a new album collaboration between Quantic and Alice Russell, called Look Around the Corner. The album is being released today.
Quantic is a DJ/producer/musician from the UK known for his various soul projects funk including the Quantic Soul Orchestra. Alice Russell is a soul singer from the UK as well, who is being hailed as one of the countries best voices. Being mentioned in the same paragraph as Adele is a benchmark often used in describing Russell. Not a bad credential to have.
Other tracks from the album had been previously released including the album’s title track “Look Around the Corner.”
From what is available online now, this album promises to be an early contender for one of the years best. This collaboration is likely to thrust both artists closer towards the discerning ear of public interest. Quantic and Alice Russell are funky together to the point where you’ll be looking for a dance floor just so you can play along with. Don’t sleep on this one.
