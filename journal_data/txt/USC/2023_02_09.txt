Let’s check Transit or Moovit to see when the bus arrives. Actually, the destination doesn’t seem too far — let’s just walk. Let’s take the Metro bus 2 and travel to Echo Park; maybe we’ll end up on the swan boats or eating tacos and plátanos at Señor Fish. Let’s take the Dash F, one of the most popular bus lines, for a ride to the Fashion District — “Los Callejones” — where we’ll find jewelry name plates and anything needed to style an outfit. 
Los Angeles is a city filled with vibrant culture and dishes that will make you lick your fingers and plate clean. Rodeo Drive and Melrose Ave., two of L.A.’s most expensive locales, are not representative of the city’s population. When arriving in such a city, one that is home to millions, it’s important for students to explore on their own and not let negative stigmas live on. 
The Metro system has made it possible for new Angelenos to get around for a low cost of $1.75. The Metro system has made it possible to travel from Downtown to Boyle Heights when in need of agua frescas and an esquite at El Mercadito. In order to explore L.A., Spudnuts can’t be your only pit-stop. Let’s instead catch the bus or go for a walk.
Where to first?
L.A. comprises an estimated 434,885 Salvadorans, and their dishes are abundant throughout the city. Most popular are pupusas and plátanos, therefore, let’s catch the Metro 38 bus line at the Jefferson/ McClintock stop. From there we can exit at Jefferson Blvd. and Budlong Ave. A two minute walk down and we arrive at our destination, La Flor Blanca Salvadoreña, where we will eat Salvadorean dishes. Another alternative could be to walk down W Jefferson Blvd as the restaurant sits two blocks away from campus. Bonus: We went on a quick ride around the neighborhood.  
Craving Thai food?
The 204 bus line right on Vermont Ave, next to Kaprielian Hall, provides a ride to Ocha, an Asian and Thai restaurant. After just 10 stops away at the Vermont / James M Wood stop, you’ll find yourself eating dishes like wonton soup and Mongolian beef.
In need of a coffee or a pan dulce?
Let’s catch the 102 Metro line and stop at Cafe Calle, a Salvadoran owned cafe. Head south on Watt Way toward W Exposition Blvd and you will be met with the Exposition / Watt stop. Hop off at the Jefferson / Central stop, walk for two minutes south and be met with the aroma of fresh coffee. 
The sheer presence of pan dulce awakens the community; the aroma of fresh bread and  conchas in the oven reminds many of home. Panaderia Hispano Americano is just one mile off campus. Ride the Metro line 2, get off at Martin Luther King Jr. St. and Figueroa St., and with just a 10 minute walk, pan dulce awaits you.
From exploring the food to the small business within a mile, you can learn more about L.A. than you could imagine. 
The negative stigma around USC has created stereotypes and discomfort from the residents, as this is their community. While students have spent four years at USC, many residents have spent years or generations living within South Central. 
To be a college student means to learn and explore different areas of interest, and to be a USC student means the same. Venturing around different parts of L.A. means learning about those that created the city, and valuing the work and culture that they still contribute. 
One of the best ways to understand an area is to walk or take public transportation — to not do so due to negative stigmas shows prejudice and an unwillingness to understand the community around us.  
It is the duty of USC students to support their surrounding community by contributing to public transportation, as well as locally owned and sourced shops and restaurants. Not only does this enrich the L.A. experience for students, but also for the people of South Central.

When I went to a protest after the Sigma Nu assaults last year, I witnessed the president of a fraternity publicly proclaim that he didn’t really know or understand what consent was because he had a girlfriend. My fellow protesters and I were dismayed that someone in such a powerful position could be so ignorant to one of the basic tenets of sexual autonomy: safety and healthy relationships. And yet we were told to hear them out, allow the community to mourn and to hope for a better future. 
A year later, rather than enact the reform and guidelines for sexual assault prevention that the Interfraternity Council worked on, most of the fraternities have chosen to disaffiliate from USC. They formed their own new organization — the University Park Interfraternity Council — with far fewer comprehensive safety guidelines, rules and institutional oversight. And a few of these fraternities have been double dipping, associating with both the University and the renegade group — in fact, all four, (and yes, only four) of the remaining fraternities listed on USC’s website as still being a part of the IFC and affiliated with USC are also listed as part of the UPIFC: Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta and Phi Sigma Kappa. 
Despite some castigating official statements from USC, all of the fraternities, regardless of IFC/UPIFC status, have largely been left alone to party without consequences or care. I’ve walked down “The Row” and have seen the Sigma Nu front yard filled with fraternity brothers  milling around, their red solo cups littering the ground. It feels like the protests were all for nothing — nothing’s changed. As per usual, a traumatic injustice comes and goes with a lot of talk but without any structural change or action. We have reverted to the status quo, almost as if nothing has happened. 
I recently completed my third and final mandatory sexual assault prevention training, “Trojans Act Now.” Despite the fact that the Sigma Nu incident was so recent, there wasn’t much talk about it. There honestly wasn’t much talk at all, at least any conversation that felt real, authentic, honest or insightful. I was disappointed, to say the least, by the random peers and students in my Zoom meeting and their unwillingness to engage, participate and converse beyond the bare minimum. 
On the other hand, I understood. I didn’t want to be there either, and I certainly have more important things to do with my time. It’s easy to be apathetic to the horrors of the world as a young college student when all you can focus on is yourself, your future, your education and your social life. The topic itself is difficult and taboo, awkward to talk about and beyond challenging to address — it’s one of society’s most commonplace ills and a tangible example of the trauma of violent misogyny. 
The course feels like a reiteration of the same lessons that have been ingrained into us for as long as we can remember: sex is dangerous, men are dangerous, protect yourself, don’t be a victim. Unfortunately, by the time we get to college, many of us are already survivors of sexual violence, and many experience more at USC. According to a 2019 survey, one in three USC students experience sexual assault, higher than the national average of one in four. 
The one-size-fits-all approach has never worked. Not for clothes, certainly not for education and especially not for sex education. People from different backgrounds have varying levels of knowledge when it comes to sex education, and the University has a responsibility to its students and the greater community to ensure that every person comes out of USC with a more nuanced, comprehensive and empathetic understanding of sexual violence. With all their words about commitment to betterment, healing or whatever flowery academic language filled with buzzwords they cram into their long emails that go unread by most students, USC has demonstrated an uncaring attitude towards sexual assault. So, it’s unsurprising the majority of the student community follows suit with their collective apathy.  
The University — especially in light of last year’s horrific sexual assaults and the blatant disrespect of attempts at reform and regulations of Greek life party culture — needs better sex education now more than ever. We have an entire department of gender and sexuality studies at USC within Dornsife. If undergraduates can be required to take writing, science, math and other gen ed classes in order to graduate, it is completely ostensible and reasonable for USC to a require a gender and sexuality course as well, a topic that learning about comprehensively will serve every student, regardless of their major or field of study. 
Sexual violence is a nuanced issue, and we need to treat it as such. USC needs to step up its game, take off the training wheels and show us they will take real action against sexual violence in our community. It’s just a shame I know they won’t, but I’ll give them yet another opportunity to prove my bad faith incorrect.

Welcome to the first issue of “Fast Break,” dissecting the top storylines and drama dominating NBA headlines as the playoffs draw closer as the NBA regular season is past its halfway point. From championship contenders to bottom-of-the-barrel draft lottery pundits, all 30 teams have seemingly settled in their place for the rest of the regular season. However, that won’t stop me from speculating, as the trade deadline always has come with a few surprises.
The Los Angeles Lakers made their first move on Jan. 23, flipping guard Kendrick Nunn and a barrage of second round picks to the Washington Wizards for forward Rui Hachimura. Hachimura, while consistently inconsistent, should shoulder some of the offensive load off LeBron James and overall looks to be a solid third or fourth option. They made yet another move on Wednesday in a three-team trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Utah Jazz, moving a tandem of Russell Westbrook and a future first-round pick for a package centered around Minnesota’s D’Angelo Russell. The Westbrook Experiment is now over, and Laker fans may rejoice. Russell improves the backcourt tremendously, and with Nick Young no longer on the LA roster, his return should go a lot better than his first stint in Hollywood.  I’d be surprised if L.A. didn’t push for deals up until the deadline, though. 
The Dallas Mavericks made (unarguably) the biggest splash, acquiring eight-time All-Star and former flat-Earther guard Kyrie Irving from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for guard Spencer Dinwiddie — who makes his return to the Barclays Center — forward Dorian Finney-Smith and a variety of future picks. Irving will join the Mavs’ MVP candidate Luka Doncic in what should be one of the most electric backcourts in the league. Dallas needed someone, anyone, outside of Doncic, and they got a good one in the recently-announced All-Star starter Irving. 
The Nets, meanwhile, have no idea what they’re doing. Yes, Irving may be an irreverent prima donna. However, the incompetence of Brooklyn owner Joe Tsai and general manager Sean Marks is really something to consider. This was not the first time a Nets superstar publicly requested a trade; forward Kevin Durant demanded a trade from Brooklyn last offseason, before ultimately deciding to stay in New York. Yeah, yeah sure — Durant’s also known for these kinds of over dramatic antics. If you’ve ever checked out his Twitter, you know what I’m talking about. But seriously, how do you acquire two — three if you count current Philadelphia 76er James Harden — superstars, and end up pissing all of them off in just three years? All I’m saying is I don’t think I could even do that, and I still dislike Durant for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder all those years ago. And Tsai and Marks are supposed to be professionals in one of the biggest markets in the league? Really makes you think.
Whether Durant may or may not be moved is a question in itself. However, I’d rather discuss some of the more under-the-radar potential deals that could surface by 12 p.m. on Thursday. The Detroit Pistons are in the middle of yet another tanking season and currently hold the last spot in the Eastern Conference. 23-year-old forward Saddiq Bey appears to be their most expendable asset, and I think most teams on the brink of contention would love 15 points and 5 rebounds a night on an around league-average efficiency. He’s also pretty durable, appearing in 51 out of the Pistons’ 54 games so far this season. Bey had flashed some serious potential as well, especially when he dropped 51 points against the Orlando Magic last March. The New York Knicks and Miami Heat may be the frontrunners to land Bey. If I were the Pistons, a first-rounder and another player for the forward would make me ecstatic.
The Toronto Raptors, despite holding premier talent such as forward and 2022 Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes and former All-Stars Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, are middling in the Eastern Conference. As a result, the 10th-seeded Raptors could ship forward OG Anunoby to a contender, most likely in the West. The New Orleans Pelicans and Memphis Grizzlies would love to add a 17 points-per-game scorer to their arsenals, so a couple of first-round picks would be well worth it. 
Finally, Jae Crowder. The Phoenix Suns forward have not stepped foot on the court all season, but I’m willing to bet the ringless veteran would love some playing time on a championship contending team. The Milwaukee Bucks could use another small forward who can shoot outside when needed, so Crowder for a few players should work out. Honestly, Phoenix might deal Crowder for anything at this point.
All of these picks could hit. The chances of me going 0-4 are probably just as high. Whether we like it or not, the deadline always surprises us. Despite this, I’m excited for what is to come. Irving may have been the biggest fish, but there’s sure to be plenty of talent on the move. In my next column, the NBA will be fresh off the All-Star Break, and I’ll be detailing how I think the regular season will shake up.

The USC men’s basketball team is looking to capitalize on their strong homestand against cross-town rival UCLA and the Washington schools. Saturday’s win against Washington was Head Coach Andy Enfield’s 200th career win at USC, good for fourth all-time in Trojan men’s basketball history. The Trojans are looking ahead in a road trip against Oregon and Oregon State to seal victories No. 201 and 202 for Enfield.
Enfield attributes his success to the coaching staff and players he’s had during his time at USC.
“We’ve had a great staff, long stability in our coaching staff and we’ve also had a lot of really good players and they have developed and done a great job representing USC,” Enfield said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
The Trojans, now 17-6 and third in the Pac-12, beat the Washington Huskies 80-74 behind career scoring highs from freshman guard Tre White and sophomore guard Kobe Johnson. White torched the Huskies with 22 points and 8 rebounds as Johnson dropped 21 points, going a perfect 9-for-9 from the free throw line.
White praises Johnson’s influence on the court.
“[Johnson] makes you want to recover for him and play harder too,” White said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Once you start to see the results, like I’m starting to play the passing line now too… watching him has been rubbing off on me … it’s crazy to play with him.”
White was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week for his performances at home against Wahsington and Washington State. The 6-foot-7-inch first year from Dallas averaged 18 points and 5 rebounds in both home victories this week. This is the second time White has been honored with the recognition this season.
Johnson also commends White regarding his leadership.
“[White] has that confidence already as a freshman, and to see someone of his caliber with that confidence is scary,” Johnson said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I love that he’s playing well and playing his game and hope he continues to do so.”
USC faces an Oregon team on Thursday night that is still alive for an automatic bid for the NCAA tournament. The Ducks likely need to win out if they have a chance to dance in March. 
“We just have to match their physicality. We know that they have to win this game to be talked about in the NCAA tournament, so they’re going to come out and play physical, play aggressive, and we just have to be able to match that,” Johnson, the sophomore captain, said.
Oregon is led by a trio of seniors: guard Will Richardson, center N’Faly Dante and guard Jermaine Couisnard. Richardson leads the team in points, assists and steals, averaging 14.0, 5.3 and 1.8 respectively. Dante leads the Ducks in rebounds, averaging 7.4 per game.
“[We] just need to stay sound on our principles; we feel like we can win this game if we stay solid on all cylinders,” White said. “I really feel like it’s an ‘us’ thing … we shoot ourselves in the foot.”
The past couple of seasons, USC’s free throw shooting has been subpar, ranking 10th in the Pac-12 last season at 66.4%. Ironically, Coach Enfield holds the NCAA record for free throw percentage as a player at Johns Hopkins — shooting 92.5% from the line during his tenure. However, some of their success this year has been accredited to their free throw shooting. 
“Yeah, I took over the free throw duties,” Enfield joked. “I finally decided to take that over and teach it.”
The Trojans now rank 2nd in the Pac-12 in free throw percentage, improving to 73.9%. 
USC will face Oregon State Saturday at 3 p.m. The Beavers are 11th in the conference. USC had to overcome an 11 point halftime deficit to win a nail-biting 63-62 game in the teams’ last meeting. In that game, the Beavers were led by junior guard Dexter Akanno, who scored 17 points with 4 rebounds and 6 assists.
In the past 2 seasons, the Trojans have been able to close out tight games, going 13-4 in games decided by 5 points or less. Coach Enfield credits this to poise.
“Our players have stayed poised, offensively and defensively. We have had a lot of close games and I think there’s a maturity about our players in the last few minutes. It’s fun to watch because we know we have a chance to win every one of those games”
White and Johnson look to aid in extending the Trojans’ winning streak at Oregon on Thursday at 8 p.m.

My catchphrase for the month is “I’m living my truth.” Didn’t get out of bed until noon? I was simply living my truth. Tipped 15% on the Girl Scout cookies that already cost $6 a box? Living my truth. Watching TikTok reality shifters until 3 a.m.? Living. My. Truth. 
Therefore, it’s only fair that I do the same with my column. 
As I have shown multiple times within the Arts & Entertainment section, I have impeccable taste. Especially on display in the section are my comedy opinions, which are non-stop hits. However, what remains hidden is my perfect music taste. Truly, my playlists amaze me. Creating a playlist solely composed of Green Day, Ice Spice and Marissa Nadler is an innovation unlike any I’ve ever seen. 
With such incredible taste in both comedy and music, what would happen if I combined my two interests? Well … it would be embarrassing. With artists producing and releasing visionary music daily, who would actually choose to listen to Fred Armisen sing off-key? 
Well, I guess we have come to the point where I live my truth. Sometimes in life, you simply need to stream “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping” by The Lonely Island. Ultimately, Taylor Swift could never have the same impact on my life as “Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song).” If the song isn’t a diss track of the Mona Lisa calling her a “basic bitch”, then I simply don’t want it.
Although, I must say that my confession comes with a caveat: My love of certain comedic songs should not be misconstrued. For every good comedy song, there are about 10 rancid ones. For example, you will never catch me listening to a parody song. The fact that someone may think that of me is honestly insulting. 
I’m sure there must be some talented parodists out there. In fact, I know there are. Nathan Fielder’s fiery subversion of Eminem’s “Not Afraid” boldly titled “Grab My Balls” was an instant classic. Truly a master of the craft, Fielder almost makes me forgive the world of parody.   
However, the terror of 2010 YouTube parodies halts any progress Fielder made. Honestly, I was too scared to click on either of their videos, but I still know the damaging impact of Bart Baker’s and Shane Dawson’s vilely racist, misogynistic parodies. Really, their songs should not be considered comedy, but I still feel the need to condemn their actions. Thankfully, impressionable middle school children are now free from the grasp of those men. 
With the comedic music that I do like, I am not trying to claim this music as a masterful piece of lyricism and melody. I am well aware that there are “better” bodies of work to listen to than the cast of the “Documentary Now!” musical “Co-Op,” but something about the ridiculousness soothes my ever-anxious mind. 
In life, I either take things way too seriously or cannot muster up enough energy to give my full effort. I am either a high-strung nightmare or so relaxed it’s annoying. The Lonely Island’s music is a sort of middle ground I’ve never been able to achieve. 
The talent of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone cannot be undersold. Their ability to churn out non-stop comedic bops is an incredible feat few could even dream to achieve. 
But, at the end of the day, their work is silly — and that is the wonderful point. The group has seen incredible — and deserved — success from their discography. But, it’s truly never been that serious because they’ve never tried to make it that serious. Listening to their music, I can just have a laugh and bop. There’s really nothing more to it. In my life, I need more of that. I don’t always need to be obsessive. I can enjoy The Lonely Island’s music and move on. 
Too much pressure is put on music taste, and I am also guilty of this. As a society, we will never be free from the clutches of the “who’s your favorite artist?” small-talk question. My answer changes based on what type of annoying I am willing to portray for the day. Am I the basic-but-loveable Taylor Swift girl? Am I the moody-never-grew-out-of-middle-school-emo-phase Jeff Rosenstock girl? Am I the incredibly-cool-possible-red-flag Fiona Apple girl?
I won’t attempt to understate the cultural importance of Spotify Wrapped day. I am well aware that the prospect of “The Blue Jean Committee” from “Documentary Now!” being your top artist on Spotify Wrapped is daunting. And sure, the possibility of a TikTok vulture catching you listening to “Dick in a Box” rather than “Paper Bag” is nightmare-inducing. Maintaining a mysteriously indie image is difficult. But if you really think about it, nothing is more underground indie than “Catalina Breeze.” 
Ultimately, not everyone will be able to truly understand the nuances of “Gentle and soft / Smooth and easy”, so just listen to what makes you happy and live your truth. 
Although, realizing my name will forever be attached to the confession outlined in this column may mark the end of my “living my truth” era.

Let’s face it: Moviegoing isn’t anywhere as affordable as it used to be. Adult weekend tickets for most theaters in Los Angeles go for around $18. However, in the age of streaming, one could argue that movie theaters have become more important than ever before. No matter how hard one may try, it is impossible to replicate the experience at home. There is something undeniably magical about sitting in the dark with a crowd on a Saturday night — with nothing in between you and the big screen — and being transported to the far off or close by worlds of your choosing. Movies are the great sacred escape that will always be there for us.
With the stress of the semester picking up, new releases every week and the epic summer movie season approaching soon, a trip to the theater will be warranted sooner than you may realize. However, sanctity alone cannot justify a lack of affordability. Utilizing the movie theater chains nearby brings quite a few ways to work around the cost and preserve the movie magic without breaking the bank.
Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Season Pass
The closest Alamo Drafthouse Cinema location for USC students is in downtown Los Angeles, which is about 10 minutes by car. A great added bonus of this location in particular is that it is accessible by metro. The theater is located in The Bloc, an outdoor shopping area that is only a few steps away from the 7th Street/Metro Center metro station.
The Alamo Season Pass goes for $29.99 and it comes with one free standard movie for every single day of the month. 3D or premium formats will require an upcharge. You can reserve tickets up to seven days in advance, however, there will be a convenience fee attached to the purchase. The Alamo has a fantastic selection of new movies, including many independent releases. They also host fun screenings and bring back older releases almost every week. It is a dine-in theater, but for those of you looking to resist temptation or save an extra buck, the water is free.
Regal Unlimited Movie Subscription Pass
The closest Regal Theaters location is also Downtown in L.A. Live. This is also about 10 minutes by car. Although there isn’t a Metro stop directly to the theater, students can take the Expo line to the Pico station and then walk about 10 minutes to the L.A. Live Regal Theater. Students can also take the Metro J line bus to Figueroa/ Olympic, which is about a five minute walk from the theater.
The Regal Unlimited Movie Subscription Pass goes for $23.99 a month, and it also brings one free standard movie for every day of the month. Enrollment requires a three-month commitment, but it can still be charged on a monthly basis. Upgraded formats will require an additional fee, but there is a small discount on concessions. The convenience fees for a standard ticket purchase for Pass members are around $0.50, so it is typically cheaper than the fee for Alamo Drafthouse.
AMC Stubs A-List
One of the closest AMC Theatres locations is in The Grove, typically 20 minutes by car from campus. 
AMC Stubs A-List goes for $24.95 a month, and offers three free movies every week. The catch? It can be any format, including 3D, Dolby Cinema or IMAX. Unlike other passes, you could even use all three on the same day. The week resets every Friday, and enrollment requires an initial three-month commitment. There are no convenience fees.
Cinemark Movie Club
The closest Cinemark location is the Cinemark Baldwin Hills Crenshaw and XD, about 15 minutes by car.
The Cinemark Movie Club is a much more relaxed approach. It costs $9.99 a month. With it, you get one free 2D ticket every month (unused tickets roll over), 20% off all concessions and no convenience fees. Premium formats take a small upcharge, and any additional tickets purchased for the rest of the month will always come at a discounted member price.
Discount Tuesdays
The next offer knows no boundaries. If you only find yourself rarely going to the movies, then when you do, consider dropping in on a Tuesday night. Tuesdays are discount days at most movie theaters, including reduced prices on premium formats. A Tuesday ticket at AMC or Regal goes for $6.50 (the AMC Stubs Insider or Regal Crown Club membership to access the discount is entirely free to join). At Cinemark it costs $6.50, and at the Alamo it is $9.
USC Ticket Office
If you are looking for one-time purchases, the USC Ticket Office sells individual passes at a discounted rate. Purchases for the passes must be made in-person. Be sure to check the Terms and Conditions for each theater. Some locations may have blackout dates or windows for certain films and showtimes, especially new releases.

The School of Pharmacy debuted its new name early Wednesday afternoon in a ceremony at Pappas Quad: The Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.
The renaming comes after Mann, an inventor and physicist, donated $112.5 million to the University in 1998. The endowment’s value has since grown to $230 million, $50 million of which will go toward the School of Pharmacy. 
Kari Franson, associate dean for academic and student affairs and professor of clinical pharmacy at Mann, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that this was the largest naming donation for a school of pharmacy in California, putting the school first and foremost.
“We’re excited that people see the potential in USC’s School of Pharmacy,” Franson said. “It’s a celebration … after everything we’ve been through with the pandemic and creating new vaccines and vaccinating pretty much everybody in Los Angeles, that you get people who are innovators and humanitarian saying, ‘I’m betting on pharmacy.’”
Daryl L. Davies, associate dean for undergraduate education and professor of clinical pharmacy at Mann, praised the renaming as being more inclusive of the all-encompassing studies done at Mann.
“The reason we advocate Pharmaceutical Sciences [as a part of the name] is because we want people to understand that it’s not just pharmacy,” Davies said. “We do drug development and drug discovery. Our graduates go to work at the FDA and CDC. So pharmaceutical science is becoming a very integral part of our program … There’s so much more to pharmacy than just the clinical dispensing of medicine.”
Many important members of the USC community gave meaningful speeches at the event. President Carol Folt, Dean Vassilios Papadopoulos, Suzanne Nora Johnson and Renita Moradian all spoke to the 350 individuals who attended the ceremony.
President Folt talked about USC’s new vision for the Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, noting that “biomedical engineering is going to lead us to our most consequential breakthroughs; that is a place where the spirit of inquiry is so important.”
Folt expressed her appreciation for the Mann family’s endowment, explaining the positive results that will come out of the additional funding for the school.
“The endowment is really designed to support students’ scholarships and advance diversity initiatives that make sure we continue to educate the full talent range in our society,” Folt said. “I want to express my own personal thanks to the family and to the foundation. It is a beautiful gift, and our pharmacy school, I think in that spirit, has innovation built into its own DNA.”
In his speech, Dean Papadopoulos discussed the important role Mann’s donation will play in better supporting the curriculum and pharmaceutical research in a sustainable manner. 
“Mann’s gift will add fuel to our revised strategic plan,” Papadopoulos said. “It focuses in part on curricular changes to ensure the school’s long-standing place. At the vanguard of progress for our field, we will continue to transform how students are educated in all of our degree programs, so they remain prepared to continue pushing forward the frontiers of pharmacy and healthcare to benefit individuals and communities everywhere.”
Moradian, a fourth-year graduate student who was the first to receive a bachelor of science degree in pharmacology and drug development at Mann, said that she hopes additional funding goes into supporting students’ journeys to various competitions and experimental rotation sites. 
“I really do hope that they continue to invest back in their community,” Moradian said. “[I hope they] continue to enable people who might be more disadvantaged — in terms of their ability to afford a four-year postgraduate program — to be able to pursue their dreams of either being a pharmacist one day or pursuing any type of degree at USC in general.”

This is the first article in an ongoing series investigating Supreme Court cases slated for the current term and their impacts on the USC community. In light of current events, the Daily Trojan News section believes it to be in the community’s interest to include the goings-on of the Court in our coverage. New installments will be published weekly.
Early in her life, Eleanor Moore’s paternal great-great-grandmother was adopted away from her tribe in western Washington State. (Moore said she does not know which.) After generations of assimilation into American culture, Moore said, she struggled to reconnect with her Native heritage.
“We haven’t really been tribally affiliated,” said Moore, a freshman majoring in sociology and a member of the Native American Student Association. “I joined NASA when I got here because I wanted to be in a community … and be in a space that my dad, for example, didn’t get the chance to be a part of. [I’m] just trying to connect with the far-off parts of me that I never really learned about.” 
In 1978, Congress instituted the Indian Child Welfare Act to end the separation of Native American children from their families, primarily by returning the jurisdiction of Native children who are adopted or sent into foster care back to the Native tribes. The implementation of the act sought to eliminate instances of cultural erasure and offer Native children the opportunity to live in Indigenous tribes. 
Now, ICWA faces a potential repeal with Haaland v. Brackeen, a pending Supreme Court case argued Nov. 9. The Daily Trojan spoke with Indigenous community members at USC, who say Native families would struggle to preserve aspects of their culture and sovereignty if ICWA is overturned.
Haaland v. Brackeen dates back to a 2018 complaint filed in a Texas district court, by seven non-Native individuals — backed by the states of Indiana, Louisiana and Texas — alleging that the ICWA had hindered their attempt to adopt Native children. Plaintiffs argued this constituted discrimination on the basis of race, as the act prioritizes returning Native children in adoption or foster care programs to their extended family or the Native people of their tribe.
Meanwhile, the United States government — alongside the Cherokee Nation, the Oneida Nation, the Quinault Indian Nation, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and the Navajo Nation as co-defendants — maintains that Congress has the right to regulate the tribes under ICWA, as it is a valid exercise of Congress’s plenary power over Indigenous affairs. 
A majority of tribes are in favor of sustaining ICWA. Out of the 574 tribes formally recognized by the U.S. government, 497 Tribal Nations and 62 Native organizations have signed the 21 briefs submitted to SCOTUS in favor of upholding ICWA. 
Jair Peltier, the graduate cultural ambassador for the Native American and Pasifika Student Lounge and a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying Indigenous sovereignty, said that the act played a vital role in keeping Native children in Native families and preventing them from being enrolled in boarding schools or put in adoptive or foster care systems. These systems were used in order to enforce Native assimilation, Peltier said, and ICWA was able to address that issue. 
“The vast majority of children who ended up in the care of these [adoptive] parents … had their identity stolen,” Peltier said. “They were not given the option to choose to live a traditional kind of Indigenous lifestyle or to be assimilated into the broader American society.”
Tok Thompson, a professor of anthropology at the Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences who teaches a course on Native North Americans, said that the plaintiffs’ argument does not hold, because “this has nothing to do with race … what this covers is Native Americans as a legal entity, as a sovereign group.” 
“In the U.S. Constitution, it enumerates the different rights of the Congress, and one of them is that the Congress shall have the right to make treaties with … the various foreign Indian tribes,” Thompson said. “[This puts] Indian tribes on the same level of treaty making as foreign nations and foreign nation-states.”
Even though it’s only seemingly applying to this one particular case of children being adopted into non-Native families, the potential to affect other aspects of tribal sovereignty is there … So it’s not just a question about adoption. It really is the question about: Do tribes have a separate political identity? Do they have sovereignty?
Raegan Kirby, a recent Native graduate who was on the executive board for NASA, said she agreed with these sentiments after learning more about the classification of race through a modern-day lens. 
“There is a phenotype of what a Native ‘should’ look like,” Kirby said. “But it’s not really a reality, especially because there are so few of us. I think that Native Americans are a very, very diverse group of people … Just thinking about being Native American as a race honestly doesn’t make sense.”
Students and faculty alike say that the implications of reversing ICWA could be dire.
“[Overturning ICWA] is counterintuitive,” Moore said. “Unfortunately, while there have been steps to right some of the wrongs, they don’t do a very good job of it. It’s hard to watch because it was so good to have, but the idea of it being taken away is really harmful. I don’t think people that are arguing against it don’t realize it. There’s a part of it that they’re not seeing.” 
Peltier said that not only could overturning the act result in a loss of cultural ties for Native children being adopted by non-Native parents, but the case could also entail a wider scope of issues at stake.
“Even though it’s only seemingly applying to this one particular case of children being adopted into non-Native families, the potential to affect other aspects of tribal sovereignty is there,” Peltier said. “So it’s not just a question about adoption. It really is the question about: Do tribes have a separate political identity? Do they have sovereignty?” 
According to Kirby, Indigenous people consider tribal sovereignty as important for Native states, as this is what allows them to govern themselves on the land they originally occupied. Peltier said he was concerned that Haaland v. Brackeen — by posing a threat to tribal sovereignty — also threatens Indigenous communities at large.
“Once you undo tribal sovereignty, let’s take it a step further,” Peltier said. “What happens to Indian Health Services? What happens to the Bureau of Indian Education? What happens to the Bureau of Land Management? All of these federal systems and structures that have been created to address … the reality of the federal trust relationship start to potentially unwind as well.” 
Kirby said that tribal sovereignty is particularly important when considering the longstanding history of cultural genocide of Indigenous people by the U.S. Overturning the act, she said, would be discouraging to the survivors and victims of generational trauma.
“ICWA, at the end of the day, is about much more than just Native children that are going through the adoption process or the foster care system,” Kirby said. “A potential overturning of ICWA … could also overturn lots of other precedents that have to do with tribal sovereignty.”
