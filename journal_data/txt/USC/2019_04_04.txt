Former Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the Paris Climate Agreement, the key elements to negate the consequences of climate change and his optimism for the future Thursday at Bovard Auditorium. 
Kerry opened “Climate Forward: Navigating the Politics of Climate Change,” a one-day conference meant to start a conversation on climate change between people and leaders on both sides of the political spectrum. More than 1,000 people attended the event.
Kerry said he did not come to USC to be partisan or political but to speak the truth. Looking toward the 2020 presidential election, he said it is important for voters to elect a leader who realizes the impact of climate change and will work toward environmental progress.
“Science has been screaming at us, warning us, compelling us to act,” Kerry said. “Climate change is going to impact every single nation on the Earth and sector of the global economy … We have no time to waste debating alternative facts.”
Kerry spoke about the Paris Climate Accord and its goal to convey that climate change is a prominent issue that must be addressed by the global community.
“What we’re feeling proud about was sending a message, an unprecedented message to  the marketplace and to the private sector, [saying] ‘Hey guys, 196 countries are all going to reduce their [carbon] emissions — all simultaneously respond to this great challenge,’” Kerry said.
Kerry also discussed the effects of the recent wildfires on Californians and listed other examples of the effects of climate change, including the melting of glaciers and the heightened impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. 
Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Dean Amber Miller, who introduced Kerry, also mentioned the fire during her introduction. She lost her childhood home to the Woosley fire last November, which influenced her thoughts/opinion of climate change.
“The increasing incidents of these fires, not just to California, but around the world, is just one direct effects of a warming planet,” Miller said. 
Characterizing himself as an optimist, Kerry said he believes people have the ability to reverse these effects, but only if they act upon it, especially through grassroots movements. 
“In 1970, when I was just back I joined in the effort in Massachusetts to organize Earth Day. It was an eye-opening immersion of the power of grassroots to force a problem onto the national radar screen and to force action,” Kerry said. “We brought 20 million Americans out of their homes in one single day, but we didn’t stop [there]. We took those 20 million Americans and converted them into the instruments of political action.”
Even though the United States dropped out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, Kerry said 37 states have made progress toward renewable energy, demonstrating Americans’ commitment to environmental conservation.
Kerry encouraged more young voters to participate in the 2020 elections, so they can influence change and create a better future for themselves. 
“In this midterm election, we had a youth vote that went from 19% to 31% … but it still means that 69% of young people, who have the greatest stake of all in the future, didn’t choose to vote,” Kerry said. “And we have to blame the politicians. Blame the people who are turning people off from the system … who are not giving people the vision of what we can really do to build our economy [and] change the future.” 
Frank Lee, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, agreed with Kerry’s points and said he was pleased to hear Kerry talk in a bipartisan manner.
“It was a really informative talk. [Kerry] gave a lot of useful information,” Lee said. “He articulated [his thoughts] without being too partisan, and I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said, and I think he explained it in a clear manner.”

No. 10 USC will play Colorado this Friday and Oregon on Sunday. The Trojans will try to extend their nine-game winning streak and secure the top seed for the Pac-12 tournament later this month.
At their last meeting with Colorado on March 16, the Trojans defeated the Buffaloes 11-5 on the road. At halftime, they led 6-4 and only allowed 1 goal for the rest of the game. Including the match against Colorado, USC has only allowed 40 goals in its last six games for an average of just 6.6 per game.  
Sophomore defender Lizzy Wagner, who has started all 13 games this season, attributes the team’s success to its fast-paced defensive approach. 
“Our low goals against average is largely credited to our fast pace defensive style, which focuses on playing quick with our feet rather than relying on our sticks,” Wagner said.  
The Trojans look to continue their impressive defensive performance to close out the regular season.  
USC has four upcoming winnable games against Colorado, Oregon, Stony Brook and Arizona State. It will be crucial for the team to maintain its current momentum heading into the Pac-12 tournament, and most likely the NCAA tournament. 
Earlier in the year, USC blew out Oregon 14-5, only letting Oregon shoot the ball three times in the entire first half. USC was well balanced on the attack with six players scoring at least 2 goals. Sophomore midfielder Sophia Donovan led the Trojans with a hat trick and an assist.  
Oregon freshman goalie Rachel Hall currently leads the NCAA in saves with 161. The talented goalkeeper will challenge the Trojans to choose and place their shots carefully.
USC recently swept the Pac-12 Player of the Week awards: Sophomore goalie Riley Hertford was named the Defensive Player of the Week, and sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff earned Offensive Player of the Week.  
The season looks as though it is heading down a similar path as last season, which ended with a loss to Stanford in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament. The Cardinal appear to be the second strongest team in the conference and seem destined for a rematch with the Trojans. 
Although USC beat Stanford in both of this year’s matchups, both games were decided by slim margins of 1 point, making the upcoming contest anybody’s game. The referees made a crucial call in the final seconds of both games that heavily affected the outcomes, so the Trojans and Cardinal are evenly matched.  
Although USC boasts one of the best records in the NCAA, the team still barely made the top 10. However, Wagner said the Women of Troy are not worried about their ranking in the polls.
“We try and ignore the rankings and the perception that we are underdogs,” she said. “Every time we hit the field we have the mentality that we have something to prove.” 
That cutthroat mentality is easy to maintain for a team still reeling from the disappointment of its failure to make the NCAA tournament last year.  
This year, the Trojans have a chance to secure the team’s best record since the program’s inception for the 2013 season.
USC faces Colorado 3 p.m. Friday and Oregon 1 p.m. Sunday at McAlister Field.

The USC baseball team will begin a three-game series against Arizona State at Dedeaux Field Friday night.
 The Trojans will enter the matchup with a 10-17 record on the season. Having lost six of their last eight games, they will be hard pressed to get back on track against a Sun Devil squad which ranks seventh in the nation and boasts an outstanding 25-2 record on the season.
ASU currently sits at second place in the Pac-12 with an 8-1 record in the conference, compared to USC’s 3-6 conference record that has it in seventh place.
If the Trojans want a chance at taking the series from ASU, they will need to pitch effectively throughout. Head coach Dan Hubbs said the team struggles when its starting pitchers don’t perform to their full potential on the mound.
“When we’ve gotten good starts we’ve had good games,” Hubbs said. “When we haven’t, we haven’t.”
Slowing down Sun Devils junior outfielder Hunter Bishop will be crucial to the Trojans’ pitching performance. Bishop will enter play on Friday having amassed an on-base plus slugging mark of 1.562 on the season, with 16 home runs already through just 27 games.
Arizona State currently has four players with an OPS of 1.000 or above compared to USC’s zero. The Sun Devils have a significant edge in their team power numbers, combining for 45 home runs on the season compared to 11 for USC.
The Trojans have usually been able to score runs this season, but their occasional inability to do so has cost them.  
After their most recent series against UCLA in which the Trojans scored 7 runs in the first game and a total of 3 in the final two, Hubbs said he would like to see more consistency from the team.
 “I’m disappointed with our consistency in general,” Hubbs said.
If USC isn’t able to swing the bats effectively against ASU, it will have a tough time stealing a win — let alone the series — from the Sun Devils. However, with the promising starting pitching the Trojans have received at times this season, they are capable of winning low-scoring games.
Sophomore pitcher Issac Esqueda and junior pitcher Connor Lunn both bring earned run averages below three into the weekend set with ASU. Sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt leads the team in innings this season and has shown flashes of dominance. Meanwhile, freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain is fresh off a performance in which he threw five innings of 1-run ball against top-ranked UCLA.
But the Sun Devils have strong pitching of their own. Junior pitcher Alec Marsh has an earned run average of 0.94 while leading the team in innings with 48 — 12.1 more than any other pitcher on the team.
Arizona State also has a strong bullpen, with two relievers compiling an ERA below 2.00 on the season and one more at 2.03.
The Trojans have proven that they can compete with the nation’s top teams; they have wins against Arkansas and UCLA this year. If they can slow down ASU’s heavy hitters and string together quality at bats against the strong Sun Devil pitching staff, the Trojans have a chance to make a statement against Arizona State.
The Trojans will look to do just that this weekend, starting with Friday’s first pitch at 6 p.m. Saturday’s game begins at 2 p.m. and Sunday’s finale is at 1 p.m.

If there’s anything that’s certain about Generation Z, it’s that we are absolutely, entirely crazy about sports.
Despite a whole bunch of mistaken headlines and pseudo-psychology articles, most current college-aged kids fall into Gen Z — not the millennial sub-category, but a broad group whose birthdays span from the mid-90s to the early-2000s. This is a specific group that has in many ways baffled and concerned advertisers and marketing specialists over the years. One of the main issues to target with Gen Z has to do with something that we’re actually great at: media consumption.
Gen Z kids pretty much consume media from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep, day in and day out. I’m not saying that’s a problem or a conundrum; it’s just a fact of life. From social media to streaming to mobile news, nearly every form of lifestyle for a Gen Z kid requires constant media consumption.
And yet, the biggest challenge of marketing to Gen Z is attempting to get the generation to consume one type of media — television. The obvious issue is that we’ve almost entirely ditched watching shows on TV in exchange for Netflix and Hulu, completely uprooting the way television is written and produced. But this phenomenon also creates concern for live sports, which act as the largest driver for TV ratings without any competition. 
The Sports Business Journal tackled this topic in a series this week, and discovered that the problem isn’t a lack of interest. Young people still love and crave sports content as much — if not more — than previous generations. The challenge isn’t getting them to watch, but rather figuring out how to adapt live sports content into a format that fits the 24/7 media consumption schedule of young people.
The main thing the SBJ study revealed is that young people love to watch sports. Around 67% of college students polled said that they watch an entire game, not just highlights or recaps, at least once a week. That’s a crazy amount of consumption, on-par with what one would expect from a super-fan keeping track of their own team, not a casual fan just tuning into a random game. In addition, 85% of these kids agreed that their preferred screen was a television — rather than a laptop or mobile device — which makes sense, given the comfort of watching a game on a big screen.
The change is in how younger generations are consuming live media events generally. Although this group wanted to watch games on the big screen, almost 40% of them preferred streaming a game over using a cable plan. When asked about their consumption habits regarding recaps and sports news, over 48% of the college kids who were polled turned to Twitter or Instagram rather than turning on “SportsCenter” or another TV show.
This results in a problem that’s not really a problem. This age demographic in many ways represents an untapped market, a huge group of young people who are enthusiastic about sports yet are unfulfilled by the current offerings of the media market.
I often feel that the general mood toward the college-age demographic is somewhat adversarial. There’s obviously the evergreen joke that “millenials” (which in common usage is also used to refer to current college-aged kids) are ruining half of the world’s industries. But with regard to the media industry, I can certainly understand how the Gen Z approach toward consumption can be frustrating.
On one hand, we want more of everything — more content, more highlights, more news, more media, all at the same time and quickly accessible. On the other hand, it is increasingly difficult to monetize many of the ways that we prefer to consume sports media and, in the meantime, ratings and viewership of live sports and live television continue to dwindle.
Ultimately, however, I think it will be best if the leaders in the sports and media industries see our generation as an asset, not a challenge. As the SBJ study concluded, Gen Z in many ways is the direct-to-consumer generation, a new wave of consumers who want brands to cater and interact directly with them. In sports, this will demand change, but that’s not a bad thing. Change could open doors to hundreds of new outlets for revenue, including the mobilization of sports gambling and the rising value of esports. 
And after all, who’s to say that all this change isn’t for the better? The desire of young sports fans — casual and serious — still remains. It’s up to the industry to learn how to adapt to them.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art curator Rita Gonzalez spoke about her professional identity Tuesday night at a talk hosted by the Roski School of Art and Design. As the Terri and Michael Smooke Curator and Department Head of Contemporary Art at LACMA, Gonzalez has curated various LACMA exhibits, including  “Phantom Sightings: Art after the Chicano Movement” (2008) and “Asco: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972–1987” (2011), among others. 
At the event, held at the Roski MFA Art Studios, Gonzalez chronicled her journey of becoming a curator, talked about some of her projects and emphasized her passion for the Latinx community. 
She explained that she did not always plan on becoming a curator. At first, she believed she was going to be an artist. However, being an MFA student at UC San Diego in the late ’80s caused a shift in her career because the artists, curators and activists were, as she puts it, “finally having an impact.” 
One work in particular that was presented during the MFA program orientation shifted the way that she thought about herself with respect to art. The piece was “Incite,” by the Installation Gallery, a thematic project centered on the borders between nations in the Americas.
“[For ‘Incite’] there would be curators from the Americas … from the United States, from Canada, Latin America and from Mexico,” Gonzalez said. “There would always be a curatorial team made up from these regions and that really would invite artists in to come and have some kind of interaction and involvement. Every time it happened it would redefine itself and reconsider the space of what it meant to come in and do a project on the border or reacting to the border.”
According to her, assisting colleagues with projects — such as a video for a work done by artist Rubén Ortiz-Torres — changed the way Gonzalez thought about art. Through these collaborations, she said she believed she was developing as an artist, but in reality, her thoughts leaned more toward the “curatorial respects” of art. 
The work done by the Adobe Group, a team of Latino urbanists, architects, scholars and artists, also heavily impacted Gonzalez as a curator. The Museum of Contemporary Art called “Urban Revisions: Current Projects for the Public Realm” and the Adobe Group’s work for this project stood out to Gonzalez, for it encompassed the type of work she realized she was attracted to. 
“[The Adobe Group was] drawing a lot from vernacular street art, body art,” Gonzalez said. This is the type of documentation — documentary tactics but also with an interventionist edge — that I’ve been really attracted to as a curator.”
A significant development in Gonzalez’s curatorial career was the creation of Artists in Los Angeles Reconceptualizing Media Arts with art historian and Williams College professor C. Ondine Chavoya. A.L.A.R.M.A. was a sensationalist magazine that comprised people with backgrounds in film, cultural and visual studies who were interested in “bringing in reflection on transnational media,” Gonzalez said. 
According to the A.L.A.R.M.A. manifesto read aloud by Gonzalez, the group comprised Chicano and Chicana video artists and scholars in Los Angeles formed in 1996 who worked together to depict the “manic train of the urban backdrop.” 
Gonzalez’s passion for bringing to light the lives of the Latinx community is evident in all of her work. Now, as the head of contemporary art for LACMA, she continues to pursue this goal and place Latinx artists on the global stage to be respected and admired.

On small, sticky plastic tables, surrounded by 300 other students, elementary school Chrissy ate a home-packed lunch every day. First tucked neatly into lunchboxes, later crammed into paper bags, my lunches were consistent: a sandwich (turkey or peanut butter and jelly, on pillowy whole wheat or sourdough), a bag of chips, a piece of fruit, a piece of candy. My mother prepared it every day, drawing from her own elementary school lunches and her mother’s before her. It was never good currency in the snack-trading world — my lunches were incredibly, painfully average. 
I am a white girl born and raised in America, and when I was younger, I ate the average lunch. Average, here, also means white and American. And because I ate the average lunch, I was never ridiculed for the food that my mother prepared for me. I was never told that my lunch was stinky, asked what I was eating, asked if my family eats dog or horse or guinea pig, or if we only eat tacos or sushi or curry. I am a white girl, and in elementary school, I ate the average lunch. 
And as a white girl, I am qualified to break a special kind of news to my fellow white Americans: MSG allergies are fake. 
In a loud atmosphere of fad diets, food has become a war zone for selective eaters (no gluten, sugar, carbs, salt, meat or processed products on my school lunch sandwich, please). Instead of facing an ultimate truth that healthy eating comes from a moderate and balanced diet, we flock to eliminate “bad” foods from our menu. This is especially true in the body-conscious climate that characterizes Los Angeles. Stomach hurts after a big meal? Gluten intolerant. Feel bad after eating ice cream? Lactose intolerant.
Being MSG intolerant, however, is a different beast — there is zero physical evidence for monosodium glutamate intolerance, and the compound itself has never been linked to any adverse health effects. In reality, MSG intolerance is built on the distrust of Chinese food and other types of Asian cuisine.
Invented early in 20th century Japan, MSG was created to extract the deeply savory umami taste in tomatoes, seaweed and other vegetables. MSG could turn bland flavors of cooked vegetables into a much richer, more filling taste, which resulted in its incredible global popularity. By the 1950s, the United States was putting it in almost every snack or processed food. Over time, however, MSG became increasingly synonymous with Chinese restaurants in the United States, which sometimes used MSG in their cooking. 
It wasn’t until the government paranoia of the late 1960s that MSG was wrongly vilified. 
Doctors and researchers began publishing articles suggesting that monosodium glutamate caused adverse reactions, dubbing it the “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.” Other wild accusations about MSG began to emerge (“Chinese Food Make You Crazy? MSG is No. 1 Suspect” read a Chicago Tribune headline).  
By the late ’80s and early ’90s, MSG had become a poisonous chemical. The quality of Chinese food depended on whether or not the restaurant used MSG, forcing Chinese restaurant owners to turn against their own, advertising themselves as a “healthier” alternative. To this day, “no MSG” is still used as a marker of quality, and to this day, despite a sea of evidence to the contrary, people continue to insist they are allergic to MSG.
In Los Angeles, with such a diverse array of eating establishments, it is important to consider how we interact with a culture’s food. Small Thai, Mexican and Chinese restaurants are prime suspects for food poisoning — but is that just because people believe that that type of food is dirtier? A bad burrito and foul street food are blamed significantly more than the uncooked fruits and vegetables, ground meat or fish that actually cause the majority of food poisoning incidents. 
Now, in a time of change and awareness, it is important to challenge our expectations and question our assumptions of a cuisine, not only in Los Angeles but also across the country. Racism and xenophobia have partially informed our food scene, but by interrogating those structures, some of its effects can be reversed. The notion that the best tacos should never be more than $1? Good pho should be less than $10? Food poisoning comes from taco trucks? MSG gives you a headache? All based on our expectations of other cultures.
I am a white American, and when I was in elementary school, I ate American on white. I was never made fun of for my ethnicity, and was never afraid to eat lunch at school. My food was never made out as an enemy to health — look at the success of Umami Burger, a restaurant that thrives off of glutamate, the same compound that MSG is made from. The key difference between glutamate in Umami Burger offerings and MSG in Chinese food is not in chemical makeup but in the makeup of their purveyors. 
I am a white American, and to my fellow white Americans: MSG intolerance is an intolerance of the unknown.

While A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s voice and melodies are often entrancing in his recorded music, the rapper struggled to complement his trademark songs with live energy at his performance at Belasco Theater Tuesday night. 
A Boogie’s initial popularity in 2016 can largely be attributed to his personal style of hip-hop, which sees him to his personal feelings and experiences. Despite their repetitive nature, the rapper’s melodies allow for catchy hooks and memorable phrases that stick with listeners. 
Just two days after the death of Crenshaw-based rapper Nipsey Hussle, A Boogie performed a mere eight miles away from where Hussle was killed. He and each of his openers decided to commemorate Hussle’s life by holding a minute of silence prior to beginning their sets.
Once doors opened, DJ Cranberry sought to keep the relatively young audience engaged by playing a mix of contemporary hits, from Blueface’s “Bleed It” to JuiceWRLD’s “Lucid Dreams.” After Cranberry, hip-hop artist Trap Manny brought palpable energy to the stage, stepping off stage multiple times to take off layers of his clothing. He performed his song “Relentless,” but due to his relatively small following, the crowd seemed to react more to his energy than to his music. Afterward, A Boogie’s labelmate and New York-based rapper Don Q took the stage. Unlike Trap Manny, his stage presence was minimal and, even though he performed almost entirely within the crowd, poor sound mixing and a lack of care to finishing his verses failed him. 
Following these relatively mediocre opening acts, A Boogie came out to extremely loud cheers and confetti, launching immediately into a surreal and emotional performance of “Look Back At It.” He brought Don Q and Trap Manny out again for a performance of “Bosses and Workers” before getting into his hit songs. Young and enthusiastic, the crowd’s energy peaked during A Boogie’s hit songs “Swervin” and “Look Back At It,” as they sang along word by word. However, aside from his big hits, the crowd seemed distant and disengaged, which influenced to A Boogie’s confidence on stage. 
Additionally, A Boogie’s music does not lend itself to the energetic performances of artists such as Playboi Carti and JPEGMAFIA, as evidenced by his failed attempt to start a mosh pit to his hit single “Drowning.” A Boogie also brought out rapper and businessman Master P, who commemorated Hussle’s life with another moment of silence. However, his late-set entrance unintentionally set an awkward mood for A Boogie’s last few songs. 
Unfortunately, A Boogie’s music and performance were forgettable in today’s high-demand and rapidly changing hip-hop landscape. A Boogie is still considered a rising hip-hop artist by some, but his ability to stay relevant in the will require him to have better command of his audiences in live performances. Sure, A Boogie’s fans undoubtedly love him, but his upcoming album will be crucial in deciding whether or not he turns out to be a flash in the pan.

The Associated Press Stylebook is something of a Bible to many journalists. It’s full of grammar quirks that you’ll likely only find when reading news articles, such as not using the Oxford comma or always using numerals for numbers 10 and above. For decades, AP Style has shaped the way language is used in media. And this past week, the Associated Press made some critical changes to its style guide. 
Particularly, AP released new guidelines on covering race in America. 
First, the Stylebook eliminated “hyphenated Americans.” This means that when referring to someone who’s Asian American, African American, Latinx American, etc., there’s no hyphen between the two identifiers. 
This might seem like a cursory change, but there’s a history behind the hyphenated American. The term was first introduced in a political cartoon published in 1899. “The Hyphenated American” depicts a series of voters at a ballot box, each with their body split down the middle, with different outfits and facial features. Uncle Sam sits atop the ballot box, saying, “Why should I let these freaks cast whole ballots when they are only half Americans?”
This sentiment was carried forward by American politicians — in 1915, Theodore Roosevelt said, “There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism,” and in 1919, Woodrow Wilson said, “Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.”
The grammatical use of hyphens reveals the questionable nature of hyphenating American nationality is questionable. Hyphens are used to compound two words when they act as a single idea. Hyphenating racial identities suggests that individuals with multiple ethnic identities cannot be just American, but they are only American when modified by their other identities. 
Frankly, I was surprised to learn that AP only now removed this clearly racist guideline. I’ve used the AP Stylebook for years as a journalist, but never realized that I was breaking a rule every time I referred to myself as Asian American or Indian American — perhaps because the Daily Trojan style guide clearly states, in capitalized bold letters, to never hyphenate Americans.  
Language has power — something as simple as placing a little dash between two words can carry a whole lot of meaning and historical weight. 
The other major change the AP Stylebook made was regarding the word “racist.” 
In the past few years, the United States has seen an uptick in racist hate crimes and sentiments (or at least, reports about them in the media), whether it’s from a white nationalist rally or from the mouth of President Donald Trump. 
But instead of calling them racist, news organizations have developed a whole host of euphemistic terms: racially charged, racially motivated, racially tinged, etc. 
One example that sparked debate in January was when Iowa Rep. Steve King defended white supremacy, saying there was nothing wrong with being labeled a white nationalist. 
Few news organizations called King’s remarks racist, and NBC News even went so far as to send an email to its staff explicitly telling them not to deem his words racist. 
“Be careful to avoid characterizing [King’s] remarks as racist,” an NBC News editor wrote in an email to the staff. “It is OK to attribute to others as in ‘what many are calling racist’ or something like that.” 
Journalists might defend avoiding using “racist,” arguing that using it breaks the cardinal rule of objectivity in journalism. But this is a very white view of the word and its use — because white people hardly ever experience racism in America, the idea itself is abstract to them. For people of color in the United States, racism is very real; it’s a systemic power imbalance that constantly reminds people of color that society is built to work against them — to minimize something that is clearly racist by calling it racially tinged or charged is an outrage. 
Now, the AP Stylebook agrees. In its updated entry on race, AP says “racist can be used in broad references or in quotations to describe the hatred of a race, or assertion of the superiority of one race over others,” and explicitly discourages the use of euphemisms like “racially motivated.” 
Words have power, and for a long time, the AP Stylebook has arbitrated the use of language in journalism — its newest entries on race are a step in the right direction.

On a short walk through her neighborhood, Lupe Andrade can see multiple generations of the same family living just a few doors down from one another. 
Many of her neighbors in Boyle Heights on L.A.’s Eastside have been her friends for over 40 years. She keeps her front and back doors unlocked 24 hours a day in case any neighborhood children need a warm meal or a place to stay.
As a paralegal and health clinic program manager, Andrade says she can afford to live elsewhere. A few years ago, she moved to some “really beautiful communities” — Rancho Cucamonga, Reseda, Beverly Hills. 
But to her friends’ bewilderment, Andrade eventually decided to move back to Boyle Heights — a lower-income, historically Latinx neighborhood that has struggled with gang violence for decades.
Andrade says Boyle Heights is her home. But it’s one she’s afraid of losing to a 79-acre medical research center.
USC’s Health Sciences Campus, located seven miles away from University Park on the edge of Boyle Heights, has been a long contested presence in the surrounding community. Keck Hospital of USC treats low-income patients with subsidized health insurance while students attending the Keck School of Medicine drive up rents in the surrounding area, displacing longtime residents. 
Now, the University’s efforts to expand the Health Sciences Campus are facing backlash. With plans for 70 new construction projects, Boyle Heights residents worry that they will lose the neighborhood they’ve lived in and loved for generations. 
But in a community that has grappled with violence and instability, some hope that USC’s presence will bring positive changes without uprooting community members and diluting its culture and history. 
“Boyle Heights has so much history, it’s beautiful the way it is,” said Monica Alcaraz, the president of Historic Highland Park Neighborhood Council. “To just really change it without really taking the community in consideration is a horrible thing to do.” 
Master plan
USC’s Health Sciences Campus is part of a larger complex of medical facilities in and around Boyle Heights that includes the L.A. County + USC Medical Center — a public hospital staffed by USC faculty. 
The campus is home to the Keck School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy, research facilities for the Ostrow School of Dentistry and various physical and occupational therapy programs. It also hosts two hospitals staffed by Keck faculty and students: the Keck Hospital of USC and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital.
According to USC Land Use and Planning Executive Director Brian League, Keck aspires to become one of the top 20 medical schools in the country both in ranking and in National Institutes of Health funding. But to fulfill that goal, the campus must expand to accommodate new research programs.
“That NIH funding, that’s real money, and that goes to research, research goes to clinical trials, research goes to jobs, research goes to construction activities,” League said at a February meeting of the East Area Community Collaborative, a coalition of local interest groups brought together by USC’s Office of Civic Engagement. “To hold all that research, we need more space.”
Planning for the expansion began in December 2009, and the official USC Health Sciences Campus Master Plan was released in 2011. It calls for more than 3 million square feet of new development over the next 25 years, aiming to improve upon four main areas: education and research; clinics; amenities; and campus quality. Projects include a 200-room hotel, graduate student housing, a health care consultation center and streetscape beautification.
The Norris Healthcare Center opened in January 2018 and construction for the Hyatt House Hotel began in early January 2019. Campus beautification entails an ongoing project to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment by reconfiguring roadways, widening sidewalks and planting trees.
These changes are also part of a larger effort to develop the LA Bioscience Corridor, a hub for early-stage and established bioscience companies nestled between the Health Sciences Campus and Cal State LA. 
Construction of additional 95-unit graduate student housing facility, which began in early March 2019, was not part of the original master plan in 2011. 
“We never thought about building student housing in 2011 … [but] our students are commuting in, they can’t find any housing in the neighborhood,” League said at the East Area Community Collaborative meeting. “We don’t want to displace the neighborhood, so after this master plan, we changed course and we opened up student housing projects.”
To obtain land for the housing, League said that USC may need to make four additional acquisitions on Playground Street that would potentially displace residents, but the University has no desire to purchase any additional housing outside of Playground Street. 
However, many residents are worried that they will be priced out, rather than bought out, of the community. With the median household income hovering at $43,519 in Central L.A. County, which includes Boyle Heights, and the number of people living below the poverty line nearly double the national average, residents are struggling to keep up with rising living costs in L.A. 
Alcaraz said she’s already noticed an impact on the local population.
“The reality is that 80% of the people that are homeless in this area are from this area,” Alcaraz said. “I’ve seen my neighbors become homeless and I’ve housed them. It’s a real issue and a lot of it has to do with the rising rent with the developers that are coming in that are not from the area.”

Eastside LEADS
To combat displacement, community members hope that USC will provide long-term job opportunities. Eastside LEADS — a coalition of 12 community groups in Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, El Sereno, City Terrace and East Los Angeles — has been working with USC and American Campus Communities, the contracted developer for the graduate student housing project, to establish immediate and long-term community benefits.
On Jan. 15, Eastside LEADS reached an agreement with both entities, which includes a $100,000 job training program, a 25% local hire rate within a three-mile radius of campus for construction jobs and an agreement to reserve at least 10% of the jobs for disadvantaged workers. The group plans to hold discussions with USC and ACC to ensure that the agreements are honored and their goals are achieved. 
“We need to ensure that that meets and exceeds [the 25% goal],” said Pamela Agustin, lead organizer of Eastside LEADS. “We should work toward the community’s goal of 50% and that includes career opportunities for youth [and] for their parents. When we think about a 30-year master plan that the University has, then that’s a 30-year plan that supports the community’s wishes to remain and thrive here.”
This agreement only came to fruition after a six-month campaign by Eastside LEADS to challenge the development. After organizing numerous community meetings and surveys to gauge community needs and concerns, Eastside LEADS found that some of the residents’ top priorities were a pathway to family-sustaining jobs, the preservation and expansion of affordable housing and youth development. But above all, residents wanted transparency and to be included in the process,  Agustin said.
“We saw that USC is moving forward with its plans but not including the community in the process,” Agustin said. “We believe that residents must be informed about any development and investment vision in the community. They must be stewards of that information, meaning they must be part of the decision-making process.”
In June 2018, Eastside LEADS mobilized over 30 residents to attend a public hearing and challenge the development. Three months later, the group invited USC’s civic engagement team, as well as partners like El Sereno Historical Society and Boyle Heights Neighborhood Council, to present the details of the master plan and outline the changes to be made.
“That was the first time that residents … heard an official presentation from USC about its master plan,” Agustin said. “But it wasn’t because USC invited the community. Stakeholders like Eastside LEADS and other organizations came together to demand that presentation.”
After an Oct. 11 hearing, the LA City Planning Commision approved the project but recommended that USC improve engagement with the community moving forward. Since then, USC and ACC have worked with community members such as Eastside LEADS to develop policies to thwart displacement and increase opportunities for economic growth within the communities.
“We hope that moving forward, those meetings [between USC and community members] truly include a conversation around every development process that they have,” Agustin said. “We hope to see that they invite residents to be part and listen to that, but also, more importantly, to collect and hear how residents could benefit from these developments. To this point, that has not been part of the conversation.”
Community engagement
Beyond long-term job opportunities, many community members hope that USC will serve and engage its surrounding neighborhood more directly through other means.
“I think there’s a lot of potential to do a lot more but I don’t really see their outreach to the fullest that it can be,” Andrade said. “They need to reach out to key leaders … somebody who’s been there for 30-plus years and knows what the community needs. Going through these nonprofits is not going to work. They need to go into the community.”
To better understand the community and its needs, Andrade suggests that USC representatives walk through the area to familiarize themselves with the neighborhood and its residents. To have more regular communication, she proposes a monthly newsletter system outlining the newest development updates and community engagement opportunities, and suggests posting them in local stores and churches frequented by community members and sending them to community leaders for additional distribution.
“They have to give back [to the community],” said Vince Rosiles, an El Sereno resident and local business owner. “They need to embrace the need. We’re not in Beverly Hills, we’re not in Westwood, we’re in Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, El Sereno. Be aware of where you’re at and who you’re serving.”
However, many residents have already seen an improvement in communication with USC after Dulce Acosta, a Boyle Heights native and USC alumna, became the executive director of community partnerships for the USC Health Sciences Campus in May 2018. After Acosta came on board, she embarked on a listening tour to assess how USC could do a better job in outreach and communication with community members. Now, she attends over 30 meetings each month. 
“When I first came on board, part of my listening tour … was to attend the neighborhood council meetings, community meetings and really ask the question: What is the best way to communicate to community members?” Acosta said. “If I talk to a senior group, they’re not going to have access to an email account, so I’m really meeting them where they are. Going to … spaces where they have their activities, and not just informing them, but asking them to provide the feedback as to what are the best practices.”
One of Acosta’s current initiatives is providing paid internships at the Health Sciences Campus to connect local community members enrolled in trade schools with mentors in their field.
“The goal is that it gets them into the internships. Not only do they get the on-site experience but they add something to their resume,” Acosta said. “In every community there’s limitations but if we take what’s already in our community and as a research institution we add to that, then I believe that that individual will have more assets than deficits and our community will as well.”
In addition to long-term projects, some community members want USC to extend daily benefits to the surrounding neighborhoods, such as granting access to gym and computer lab facilities, free after-hours parking at USC and street cleaning.
“If you drive by USC, their side of the street is immaculate and clean and well-manicured, and across the street is the neighborhood,” Rosiles said. “I’m not telling you to go into the depths into the neighborhood, but at least the near vicinity on the same block you share, you should have the same desire to keep that clean.”
By including community voices, many hope that the changes brought by USC’s expansion will benefit the community.
“If you talk to someone like my mother, like my family, that have really witnessed the impact of USC, they welcome change, and a lot of our community members welcome change — but of course, when we do it with dignity, when we do it ethically, and when we’re transparent,” Acosta said. “When we can come out and say, ‘Hey we didn’t know what were the best practices, but now we know,’ shame on us if we don’t practice them and implement them.”
