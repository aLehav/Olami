With USC junior Maria Sanchez in New Haven, Conn. for the ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships last weekend, three of the six other members of the USC women’s tennis team had undefeated weekends.
Senior Sarah Fansler upended her competition at the Duel in the Desert in Palm Springs, Calif., knocking out four players from the University of Texas-Austin. In the opening round, Fansler fell in the first set to Maggie Mello, but came back and crushed Mello in the last two sets.

Fansler beat the next two Texas players in two-set matches before ousting Sarah Lancaster during the final round of Flight 1 in a close match, which consisted of a 10-point tie breaker in lieu of the third set, 7-6 (6), 3-6, 1-0 (10-6).
Junior Leyla Entekhabi also defeated three players from Texas. She sped through first two rounds in two-set matches and then posted a 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-3 victory over Amanda Craddock.
At the same time, freshman Valeria Pulido took down her first opponent from Northwestern in a 6-1, 6-1 match, while the next three came from Texas as well. Pulido outlasted her opponents in close two-set matches and defeated her final opponent, Caroline Larsson, in three sets, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.
Junior Cristala Andrews tallied two victories, while sophomore Alison Ramos and junior Lyndsay Kinstler each came out with one win.
On the doubles scene, Andrews and Entekhabi pulled out a win, while Kinstler and Pulido and Fansler and Ramos each came away with a split on the doubles courts.
On the East Coast at Yale University, Sanchez faced her first opponent on Thursday and posted a 6-2, 6-3 win over Miami’s Laura Vallverdu.
The next day, in the round of 16, Sanchez fought in a tough three-set match against Anastasia Petukhova of Fresno State.
The unseeded Petukhova had already upset the No. 1 seed the previous day. Sanchez topped Petukhova in the first set, but fell short of a quarterfinal bid, losing to Petukhova, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.
This weekend marked the end of fall competition before a two-month break that precedes the start of the 2010 spring season, which will consist mostly of team competition.
“It is a totally different feeling playing for your team and instead of just for yourself. It creates a very different atmosphere,” Entekhabi said.
Last spring, the team took home its first Pac-10 Championship.
“I really enjoy playing against the Pac-10, because it’s more than just winning and losing. Pride is always on the line when we play against our toughest rivals,” Ramos said.
USC also finished 21-3 overall after making a run to the NCAA second round, which placed the team ninth in the nation last year.
“Sure, winning the Pac-10 title again would be amazing and of course we think about that, but we are just going to take it one match at a time and not focus too far ahead in the future,” Entekhabi said.
USC resumes competition in mid-January, when half the team will head to the Las Vegas Invitational and the other half to the Palm Springs Invitational.

Sophomore Steve Johnson entered the ITA Regional Indoor Championships seeded No. 5 — his first seed in a college tournament.
On Sunday he walked away from the tournament a National Indoor Champion.

“It feels unbelievable. It hasn’t really sunk in yet,” Johnson said.
Assistant coach George Husack was thrilled for his young star.
“To be here and see Stevie do it, it was definitely a highlight of my career,” he said.
The tournament, which was held at Yale University, had a main draw of the nation’s top 32 players. Johnson had four of his five matches go the full three sets, including a semifinal match against No. 1-seeded and No. 2-ranked J.P. Smith of Tennessee.
In the third set, Smith was up 4-1, 40-15. He needed only five more points to eliminate Johnson from the tournament. Johnson, however, was not ready to go home.
“J.P. Smith had won All-Americans and I was five points away from losing it but I really just kept my composure,” Johnson said.
His ability to keep his cool is what Husack attributes to Johnson’s championship — especially since the sophomore lost his three first sets this weekend.
“He has a great ability to stay composed and focused,” Husack said. “It was huge for him.”
In the final match, Johnson faced off with No. 5-ranked Guillermo Gomez of Georgia Tech. Gomez had defeated Trojan senior No. 3-seeded Robert Farah in the round of 16. Johnson took the match in a 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3) decision.
For Johnson, the semifinal and final matches against Smith and Gomez were a way for him to avenge his teammate and doubles partner, Farah.
“I got my revenge on J.P. for beating Rob at All-American and now I will do the same for Guillermo because nobody beats two Trojans,” Johnson said prior to the final match.
Husack felt that Johnson’s style of play was a better match for Gomez than Farah’s.
“Gomez had to come up with some really unbelievable shots and points to beat Rob, but he really just neutralized Rob’s game,” Husack said. “Stevie has a totally different game than Rob. He could slice with Gomez’s slices.”
In doubles matches, the No. 3-ranked and unseeded pair of Johnson and Farah did not walk away with the championship they had their eyes on. The two lost in the quarterfinals to the eventual finalists, Reid Carleton and Henrique Cunha of Duke University.
Husack said the pair was just having an out-of-character match.
“The two of them just weren’t clicking well together and that’s rare for them,” Husack said.
Johnson should enter the spring season ranked No. 1 in the nation, according to Husack.
“That for sure has not sunk in at all,” Johnson said. “It’s been an unbelievable month or two.”
Locally, several Trojans competed at UCLA in the Southern California Intercollegiate tournament this weekend.
Sophomores Daniel Nguyen, No. 99 Matt Kecki, junior Daniel Gliner and freshman J.T. Sundling all competed in the singles main draw.
Gliner, who earned a spot in the main draw after winning two qualifying rounds, was eliminated in the first round of play. No. 5-seeded Kecki made it to the quarterfinals before falling to eventual champion No. 21 Bassam Beidas of Pepperdine University, who was seeded No. 2.
Nguyen and Sundling lost in the semifinals of doubles to eventual champions Matt Brooklyn and Kalim Stewart of UCLA.
No. 5-seeded Nguyen and Sundling faced each other in the semifinal match. Nguyen emerged with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over his teammate and doubles partner.
Nguyen then matched up with Beidas in the finals where he lost in three sets, 2-6, 7-6, 3-6. Overall Nguyen was satisfied with almost beating Pepperdine’s top player.
“I just took it point by point and really put my heart on the line,” Nguyen said.

As their teammates practiced routes at Monday’s practice, injured redshirt junior receivers Damian Williams and David Ausberry watched from the sidelines — Williams suffering from a high ankle sprain from Saturday’s game against Arizona State and Ausberry from a nagging calf injury.
Wide receivers coach John Morton listed both Williams and Ausberry as “day-to-day” and predicted that Ausberry wouldn’t return for Saturday’s game against Stanford. Head coach Pete Carroll said that if Williams practices at all this week, it would not be until after he sees team doctors Tuesday.

Against ASU, Williams was a bright spot in the Trojans’ sputtering offense, scoring the team’s only offensive touchdown on a thrilling 75-yard touchdown pass. The receiver showed confidence regarding his status.
“I’m a quick healer,” Williams said. “I’m going to be smart about it, obviously. I’m not going to play if I can’t, but I’m going to try to. I’m going to rehab as much as I can, and hopefully I can come back and play. We’ve got the bye week next week, so that will help a lot.”
A major hole in the Trojan offense, according to Carroll, has been the absence of senior tight end Anthony McCoy, sidelined with an ankle injury. Before exiting Monday’s practice early, McCoy ran several drills. He said he felt ready to play Saturday.
“The season’s almost over — that’s my urgency in trying to get back,” McCoy said. “Regardless of how the tight ends now are doing, I’m going to get back so I can finish out my senior season the right way,”
Carroll commented that the injuries plaguing the Trojans all year have allowed more players to make names for themselves on offense and defense, singling out redshirt sophomore linebacker Shane Horton and redshirt freshman receiver Brice Butler as examples.
“I think we’ve been banged up pretty good,” Carroll said. “We’ve had our share of issues, everybody has them. But a lot of guys step up and do really well when they’ve got the chance to.”
Morton similarly said that the one good aspect of all the injuries within his unit is the chance for younger players to gain experience both on the practice field and in real game situations. Even with Williams and Ausberry questionable, Morton said the team is ready to play Stanford.
“The good thing is that the younger guys get the reps, so we’re well prepared and ready for the game,” he said.

Both Carroll and defensive coordinator Rocky Seto offered praise for a Stanford Cardinal team that has surprised some this season. The Cardinal ran over Oregon for 51 points in its victory against the Ducks last weekend.
“They’ve been playing great football,” Carroll said. “We’ve seen them throughout the season. They’ve done tremendous things on offense with the new quarterback. They already have a great concept and approach with running the football with Toby [Gerhart].”
Seto said that Gerhart, who rushed for three touchdowns and a school record 223 yards against Oregon, presented a different kind of challenge for a defense accustomed to smaller running backs like Jacquizz Rodgers of Oregon State.
“He’s definitely not like a Joe McKnight, he’s not like a Jahvid Best. He’s a hammer,” Seto said.
Despite bouncing back against Arizona State, Seto said that the defensive unit will continue to practice and improve upon the weaknesses that crippled them against Oregon.
“We’ve definitely got to emphasize tackling and making sure we’re physical,” Seto said. “It’s going to be a challenge, but as long as we prepare well I think we’ve got a good chance.”

As we grow up, our relationships with our parents can be quite difficult to manage. The phone calls they insist we make everyday, the birthday wishes that so often slip our minds and the inconvenient trips back home all contribute to the constant activity and intense stress levels that college students already face.
Daily Trojan
Sure, there is no denying that family is important, yet that grueling organic chemistry midterm or the 10-page English literature paper due this week will more than likely take priority.
No longer reliant on mommy and daddy to tuck us in at night, we have become independent, responsible and self-sufficient young adults — or so we would like to think. The divide between having parents who hover over our every move from more than 5,000 miles away or having ones that barely notice we’re even gone (and since moving out, our rooms have transformed into home gyms) is hard to measure — we can’t decide which we’d rather have. Many of us have already had to institute a ban on our parents from joining Facebook.
On the surface, the role of parenting in Hollywood should not be too different, right? It can be assumed that parents of young stars will still take on the same responsibilities as they did before they became famous: raising them to become upstanding individuals, providing them love and guidance and always being available to bail them out of trouble. For Tinseltown’s newest generation of rebel rousers, the latter is basically guaranteed.
But as these young celebrities reach exponential heights of success, a pattern of poor parenting seems to be the case. Mom and Dad abandon the standards they once held themselves to and instead find ways to greedily capitalize on their child’s new found fortune.
When Macaulay Culkin, the child actor behind the Home Alone series, enjoyed his first taste of the spotlight, his notorious stage dad was there to cut the celebration short, opening legal battles that disputed custody rights and access to Culkin’s money (he was a minor at the time).
Actress Drew Barrymore faced problems with her parents from the get-go and filed for emancipation at the early age of 15.
The mother of Friends star Jennifer Aniston penned a tell-all book about her daughter after their falling out.
With fans knowing anything and everything there is to know about their favorite celebrities, today the territory of a star’s relationship with their parents is never off limits.
Michael Lohan, the father of tabloid spectacle Lindsay Lohan, has had stints in jail, and is battling allegations of domestic abuse. Since his very public release from jail, Michael Lohan says he has been dedicated to finding help for his daughter, but all the while continues to generate revenue from media outlets each time he gives an interview about Lindsay Lohan.
Last week, perhaps looking for another lucrative opportunity, Michael Lohan topped his history of outlandish fatherly behavior and sank to a new low: recording an emotional phone conversation he had with a tearful Lindsay and leaking the tape to numerous online entertainment sites online.
Though his true intentions of revealing Lindsay Lohan’s private feelings will never be known (he claims he wanted the world to know her condition so she can be pushed into rehab), the repeated parental practice of selling out and cashing in on their kids has evolved into a disgusting sport that is so commonly played out in Hollywood.
Lindsay Lohan’s mother offered no comment on the situation, as she is too busy living like she’s 21 again, enjoying the rounds at the hottest nightclubs in New York and Los Angeles — all on her daughter’s tab, of course.
Today, the degree to which the public is so openly exposed to the falling outs between stars and their parents can be catastrophic. Family feuds are broadcast loudly to riveted audiences and gossip reporters are digging far into background checks for a scrap of dirty laundry. Usually, it’s the parents looking for a piece of the limelight who come forward with the goods.
Meanwhile, while 16-year-old Miley Cyrus is busy gyrating on stage in a dominatrix-esque leather jumper for a performance at a charity event, people wondered, where were her parents? For young celebrities, parental negligence is hitting an all-time high.
So for college students: Enjoy the care packages parents occasionally send and embrace the sometimes-annoying display of interest they show when wanting to know everything about their child’s lives. Pick up the phone, give Mom a call and just be thankful it won’t be recorded and sold to TMZ or OK! Magazine.

Great article, but you have to wonder if it’s all real. Some of these instances of “parental negligence” could potentially be publicity stunts. I wouldn’t put it past Hollywood.

Ah, homecoming — a time for students, fans and alumni to join together and party themselves into oblivion.
And I guess there’s a football game too.
A 12:30 p.m. kickoff may be somewhat of a buzzkill for most USC fans, but the Trojans are probably just happy to be returning home. The last four games have done little to inspire faith in the team, so what better place than the Coliseum to set things straight for the final three contests of the year?

But by scheduling Stanford for the homecoming game, it’s clear that someone in the athletic department either has a nose for good storylines or an excellent sense of humor.
I don’t have to remind you of the 2007 game that has been coined by some as “The Greatest Upset Ever.” You’ll hear plenty of reminders throughout the week that this is Stanford’s first game in the Coliseum since that night. The media will hype up the revenge game only to have USC coach Pete Carroll and his players downplay the angle, and rightly so.
Both programs have undergone shifts since that October night two years ago, and there are bigger objectives at play than vengeance. USC and Stanford are in the thick of a conference title race, and a loss Saturday would set either team back in a shot at a top-tier bowl.
But there’s still a lesson to be taken from the last time the Trojans lost in the Coliseum.
Last time, I was standing on the sideline right next to the end zone, where Stanford wide receiver Mark Bradford came down with the winning touchdown catch. Listening to the sound of more than 85,000 people going silent still ranks as one of the more surreal sensory experiences in my life.
The loss hit home for players in more than one way. It was just the first time in 36 games that the Trojans had dropped a game at the Coliseum. And it came to a 41-point underdog whose coach had entered the year promoting that year’s USC squad as the best team in the history of college football.
Senior defensive end Lawrence Jackson said a loss was the same “whether you’re in the Coliseum or on the moon,” but Carroll looked like a man who had been shaken to his core by the defeat.
“I was looking at the color red on this [tablecloth] and it just looked different to me today,” a dejected Carroll said in his postgame press conference. “Things have always been the same here and it looked and felt different today.”
An aura of invincibility was shattered that day for the Trojans. There had been an assumption that even the clumsiest efforts by USC would eventually be salvaged, especially at home.
But the sleepwalking Trojans were in for a rude awakening.
“It was not about Stanford tonight,” Jackson said after the game. “It was about us.”
Those words should stay in the mind of any fan who thinks that USC’s recent woes will be solved by playing at home. The Trojans still have plenty of woes, and if the contest against Oregon State was any indicator, teams won’t simply roll over for USC anymore.
Some fans are optimistic about a strong finish given Carroll’s undefeated record in November and in homecoming games. But as the loss to Stanford taught us, such trends are not absolute rules.
College football teams operate on a week-to-week basis, frequently acting independently of their most recent game. How else do you explain Oregon’s effort against USC and subsequent stomping by Stanford?
If the Trojans have anything going for them, it’s that they won’t be caught by surprise again. Stanford is the new “it” team in the Pac-10 with the touted backfield of senior running back Toby Gerhart and freshman quarterback Andrew Luck.
USC shouldn’t need a reminder about fixing its own problems after its last four performances. With the way Stanford has played lately, the Trojans need to prove they have learned something since the last time the Cardinal came to the Coliseum.
But at least no one is accusing of the Trojans of being the best team ever this time.

In the last decade, a multitude of solutions have been proposed to combat the ever-growing issue of illegal immigration — taller fences, stricter deportation policies, brigades of Minute Men exercising their somewhat-alienable right to good old fashioned vigilantism.
However, in the host of band-aids different groups have tried to apply to the problem, few solutions have come close confronting the source: convoluted straits of legal immigration.
Promises of immigration reform have been made, earmarked and forgotten, and politicians continue to play the blame game.
On Monday, however, a major battle for immigration reform was won in California. Fighting endless litigations with litigiousness, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center settled a case that had been filed with the federal government in 2007.
The settlement effectively puts a kibosh on the status quo of limitless delays in the processing of requests for legal citizenship. There is also now a six-month time limit on the hundreds of naturalization requests currently in legal limbo in Los Angeles, Santa Ana and San Bernardino counties.
This case sets an important precedent for the problem of illegal immigration on the national level.
Bureaucracy has long been the nail in the coffin. According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 525,000 petitions for naturalization were filed in 2008; by the end of the year, more than 480,000 applications were still awaiting a decision.
The median number of years for the delay between legal immigration and naturalization was nine years in 2008 — a number that has increased one year each year since 2006.
Many applicants can’t even get to this point. The Los Angeles Times reported that one immigrant from the United Arab Emirates filed for citizenship in 2005, and waited three years without hearing anything. Only when she filed a lawsuit was her case addressed.
The ACLU and the NILC faced a minotaur in a bureaucratic maze, and the results are a good example for other district courts to follow.
The US Citizenship and Immigration Services estimates that 6.5 percent of California’s population is comprised of illegal immigrants  — extrapolated, that gives Los Angeles a population of more than 1 million undocumented citizens. The Golden State is at the forefront of the issue, and the government’s steps to combat the issue at its source are admirable. We can only hope other states take similar measures.
The only way to enforce legal immigration is to present it as a feasible option, rather than to fence with barriers and border patrols.

When it comes to social networking, I consider myself a generous person. I am willing to click like there is no tomorrow, joining Facebook groups I don’t care about and becoming fans of things I’ve never heard of just so its owners can get one more popularity point.
These are the sacrifices I make for my Facebook friends, allowing them to spam my account as often as they please. I also do not discriminate harshly when it comes to accepting friends or following people on Twitter, and so my homepages are scattered messes of statuses and Tweets.
Although I’ve considered mindless clicking gestures of support for many years, there comes a time when the clutter becomes too overwhelming.
Luckily, our social networks offer features to help us do spring cleaning in November.
The first step is realizing you are in too many digital relationships. Telltale signs of this are myriad Facebook messages from club promoters, friend requests from people you’ve met through Twitter or a home page filled with meaningless trending topics (#StuffThatsAnnoying, etc.). At one point in time, connecting with all these people might have made sense to you, but the extent of your social life has no doubt made your networks unorganized — and it’s time to fix it.
Cue list functions. Facebook introduced one a long time ago, and if you don’t use it, you should. By grouping your friends according to various categories, you will significantly increase your Facebook experience. For getting rid of status updates from people you could care less about, clicking the hide button on their news feed post is highly underrated and relatively painless to the person you are blocking.
Twitter, on the other hand, just recently introduced an organizing system that could actually be complimentary. Unlike Facebook’s function, Twitter enables you to see public lists you have been placed on, allowing you to know how (or perhaps more importantly, if) your friends categorize you. If you check your follower count compulsively, you have likely noticed the new “listed” category that has come to fruition. This number lets you and everyone else know what Twitter lists you’ve made it on.
Twitter lists not only offer a whole new way to cut your online clutter, but they offer a whole new way to use the system itself. A lesser-known fact is that lists allow you to “follow” users without actually following them — you can add anyone to lists as long as their account is public.
Because Twitter is a social network where follower counts halfway determine user legitimacy, it is odd that lists were introduced with this feature.
However, it has simply turned the “listed” count into the new number to rack up. And lists themselves connote a different type of popularity — they suggest that your Tweets have some purpose, and the label of a list gives you an idea of what that purpose is.
When grouping users, you have almost infinite freedom. You can put blogs, customers or comedians together. Lists can help you sort your news by location and your friends by sense of humor.
If you make your lists public, people can see where you’re putting them, and that allows you to acknowledge their online significance to you. Think of it as offering your support.
More so than Facebook, you can group people temporarily. For example, if you are planning an event, you can collect the Twitter usernames of people coming and encourage them to follow the list you put them on. After the event, they can all go their separate ways.
Lists are a somewhat underused feature of most social networks.
This is understandable, as college students have enough trouble organizing their schedules and music database. However, they offer a lot of benefits to you and those you group. They help refine online personalities by imposing labels, and they can allow you to follow less people or be organized with your social networking habits.
It may take a few minutes, but optimizing your Facebook and Twitter is only a few clicks away. Or if you’re simply too lazy, you can follow other people’s lists.
Relying on your peers to do the work? A perfect demonstration of one of social networking’s key benefits.

Dashboard Confessional
Alter the Ending
Vagrant/Interscope
Now available
Two years after the release of Dashboard Confessional’s last studio album The Shade of Poison Trees, singer/songwriter Chris Carrabba slips further into his Christian rock-tinged emo-project with Alter the Ending, 12 more tracks about promiscuous women, loneliness and the sweeping feeling of summer love.
A free acoustic track released earlier this year — “Even Now” — gave fans a tease of the upcoming album and sparked debate over whether Carrabba was at work on an electric or unplugged endeavor. Turns out, both sides are technically correct.
Alter the Ending will be sold in a format similar to indie-band The Good Life’s 2004 release, Album of the Year.
Just as the The Good Life (side project of Cursive’s Tim Kasher) released its third CD as an electric album packaged with a bonus disc featuring all of the tracks’ acoustic versions, Carrabba’s Alter the Ending aims to bring together the two sides of his fickle fan base. Wavering between power chord-laden, fist-punching emo anthems and reflective, Jesus-praising slow jams, the band’s sixth album fails to recapture any of the raw songwriting found on its first two albums, 2000’s Swiss Army Romance and 2001’s The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most.
But neither the somber nor mildly upbeat renderings of Dashboard Confessional’s new songs do much to flatter Carrabba’s voice, which — despite obvious Auto-Tune assistance — still strains to reach the high notes.
Although Alter the Ending might disappoint those accustomed to the just-post-Further Seems Forever version of Chris Carrabba, listeners who signed on with their Spider-Man 2 soundtrack-contribution will appreciate both versions of Dashboard Confessional’s newest overproduced endeavor.

Omar Rodriguez-Lopez
Xenophages
Rodriguez Lopez Productions
Now available
Omar Rodriguez-Lopez lives in a world of sound so avant-garde it is almost as if he wishes to be misunderstood.
Through his years playing with seminal bands such as At The Drive-In and its still-active successor The Mars Volta, Rodriguez-Lopez’ guitar-playing has developed into a sonic wall of dissonant harmonies, nondiatonic scales and manipulated tonal structures that have the capability to simultaneously eat your brain and lull you to sleep.
Since 2004, Rodriguez-Lopez has set up in various cities around the world and concocted concept solo albums at an inhuman rate.
But it is Xenophages, his 12th and latest full-length — which was recorded from his new hideaway in Zapopan, Mexico — that is, if possible, the musician’s most ambitious yet.
Although previous solo efforts have been mostly instrumental experiments with Mars Volta album rejects, Xenophages is a ship helmed entirely by Rodriguez-Lopez. The El Paso, Texas native not only masterfully shreds the album’s heavy progressive-rock riffs, he also wrote its foreign-language lyrics that spell out a sordid journey through psychedelic concepts.
Sung entirely in Spanish, each of the eleven tracks — with translated titles like “Losing the Art of Reason Without Moving One Finger” and “Bleeding Behind the Eyes” — represents one lifetime of the album’s constantly reincarnating main subject, a jilted female caseworker.
The album’s title, Xenophages, is also part of the recording’s high concept, referencing the Greek philosopher whose religiously critical conceptions were not widely accepted until centuries after his death. Ordinarily years in the making (or decades if you’re Guns and Roses), Rodriguez-Lopez’s concept albums are churned out faster than a McDonald’s drive-thru.
With another one already slated for release next month, fans better let Xenophages sink in quick, before it becomes usurped by the next barrage of incomprehensible genius.

Black Rebel
Motorcycle Club
Black Rebel
Motorcycle Club Live
Vagrant Records
Now available
With grunge pioneers like Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr coming out of the plaid-clad woodwork this year, releasing new material and conducting nationwide tours, there’s no doubt that audiophiles have a resurgence of garage rock on their hands. At the height of this revival — and faithfully following in the steps of its aforementioned influences — is Los Angeles via San Francisco garage rock and neo-psychedlia-infused band, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.
Formed in 1998, BRMC has been fueling indie rock for more than a decade with its penchant for droning and distortion, which has led to well-deserved comparisons to everyone from the highly regarded shoegaze band The Jesus and Mary Chain to contemporary pysch rock band The Brian Jonestown Massacre.
But it’s been more than a year since BRMC has released new material — unless, of course, you count a debut track on the The Twilight Saga: New Moon soundtrack — and although a new album is due out in March 2010, that means quite a long wait for BRMC lovers. But for those of you who have too much self-dignity to be seen in Best Buy shelling out cash for a CD with a brooding Robert Pattinson on the cover, BRMC has been kind enough to grace its infinitely cooler die-hard fans with its first live DVD appropriately titled, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club Live.
The three-disc DVD set features more than two hours of up close and personal concert footage from the band’s 2007 Baby 81 tour in Berlin, Dublin and Glasgow, as well as a 90-minute behind-the-scenes exclusive that includes both tour highlights and an intimate look at the production of its 2005 album, Howl.
Filmed mostly in black and white with sudden, hazy glimpses of color, the grainy recordings perfectly encapsulate the band’s rough and raw gritty sound, while the epilepsy-inducing stage lights and dramatic low angles maintains the concert’s larger-than-life scale.
The set also comes complete with a 48-page photo booklet and a 14-track CD, which includes songs from the concert film. Although the tracks aren’t new, the bonus album is sure to appease BRMC lovers through the winter.

An army general is sitting at his desk, staring intensely at the wall. He gets up, runs toward the wall and, believing he will easily go through it, hits the wall and falls onto the ground, disappointed.
He has the skills — or at least he thinks he does — of The Men Who Stare at Goats.
Earth, wind and fire · A new-age Jeff Bridges (center) and George Clooney (right) hone their psychic abilities as members of a special branch of the US Army in The Men Who Stare at Goats. The film, which is directed by Good Night, and Good Luck writer-producer George Heslov, is based on British journalist Jon Ronson’s nonfiction novel about spiritual military concepts. - Photo courtesy of Overture Films
The new film starring George Clooney, Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges — which is based on British journalist Jon Ronson’s nonfiction book of the same name — depicts the training and development of the New Earth Army, a special branch of the military that incorporates psychic abilities into military combat.
The New Earth soldiers can make themselves invisible, permeate walls and even stop the hearts of living beings just by staring at it. They are referred to by the army as psychic spies, but they prefer to be called Jedis.
McGregor plays Bob Wilton, a down-on-his-luck American journalist who is covering the war in Iraq. It is there in the Middle East when he stumbles into Lyn Cassady (Clooney), who turns out to be the most infamous and powerful psychic spy there is.
Desperate for a good story, Bob eagerly joins Lyn on his newest assignment.
As they journey through Iraq on what Bob has been told is a top secret mission, Lyn gradually reveals the details surrounding the creation and his eventual training under the illustrious Bill Django (Bridges), the leader and founder of the New Earth army.
They are soldiers who fight with their minds, not conventional weapons, and they learn their new-age skills through liberal means such as meditation, narcotics and, most importantly, dance.
The film then continues to jump back and forth between the present day mission and Lyn’s past experiences with Bill, propelling two different storylines at the same time — perhaps the main flaw of The Men Who Stare at Goats.
The strengths within the film come only when the screen is being occupied by Clooney or Bridges.
Their characters have the most energy, get into the most trouble and deliver some of the best comedic lines recited on screen this year.
One of the best scenes involves Bridges teaching Clooney (wearing a dashing wig) how to dance by Bridges in which the subtle, easy humor they share on screen comes off as nothing less than natural. The dancing, among other attributes, showcases the quirks and instinctive mannerisms these two actors convey to make their characters unique and sensational.
Every scene Clooney and Bridges share is priceless, but the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast or the rest of the film.
Almost all parts involving McGregor are bland and carry on for too long. The usually reliable McGregor easily loses his place and charisma (as well as his accent) when measured up against the flawless chemistry between Clooney and Bridges.
To watch McGregor’s facial expressions shift when someone utters the word “Jedi,” however, is still quite amusing, since McGregor portrayed Obi Wan Kenobi in the last three Star Wars films.
But the film’s overall plot, including its dire voice-over narrative, simply does not have any direction. Its brilliant characters can only drive the movie so far before its meandering plot slumps over even more so with an ending that doesn’t tie up any loose ends.
The parallel storylines of the past and the present are crudely infused, leaving not nearly enough scenes involving the development of the psychic spies. Every time the film cuts back to McGregor, the pace of the film slows until Clooney’s professionalism finally comes to rescues it.
Although The Men Who Stare at Goats is advertised and often played as a comedic farce, the film inadvertently switches to melodrama halfway through and attempts to lecture its audience about America’s presence in Iraq with the worst subplot of the film. These social critiques are rendered corny and painfully out of place.
First-time director Grant Heslov — who co-wrote Good Night, and Good Luck with Clooney — has yet to find comfort as a director. There is no rhythm to the film and the better scenes are almost always interrupted by horrible ones, taking screen time away from what is actually very good and very funny about this film.
Although The Men Who Stare at Goats has two great characters inhabited by two great actors, it does little else to make staring at it tolerable.

If you are inclined to believe the Wall Street Journal, the snood is the hottest accessory imaginable this holiday season. No, not this snood.
This snood.
A snood is a cross between a scarf and a hood. Of course. They are also known as “infinity scarves.” Because it is essentially a scarf that has no beginning or end.
This giant necklace for your head can be worn by men or women. And you know it’s a verifiable trend if Lady GaGa wore one and Donna Karan has a $700 version.
The WSJ thinks the Snood can save Christmas, but I have a feeling they are overestimating how desirable it is to look like your Russian grandmother.

Next time you get back a regrettable grade on an exam remember that it could have been worse.
This student got reprimanded by a professor for being the first student ever to receive zero points on a Communications 101 exam.
He was trying his luck by filling out all “C’s,” a strategy which is only  somewhat helpful on regular multiple choice tests, and is significantly less so on  True/False tests.
It would be fun if professors called out students Billy Madison style more often though…
