USC is pursuing Penn State running back Silas Redd, according to multiple media reports.
ESPN’s Joe Schad first reported Monday night that the Trojans had notified Penn State of its interest in Redd, a 5-foot-10 junior from Norwalk, Con. Redd rushed for 1,241 yards and seven touchdowns for the Nittany Lions last season.
USC coach Lane Kiffin declined to comment on the possible transfer at Pac-12 Media Day on Tuesday but did acknowledge running back depth was the Trojans’ primary concern.
“We cannot comment on any players on the [Penn State] roster,” Kiffin said. “They are just like high school kids. We can’t say anything about it.”
In the aftermath of severe penalties levied by the NCAA on Monday, which include a $60 million fine and a four-year postseason ban, Penn State players are also eligible to transfer to another Football Bowl Subdivision school without sitting out the season.
It is not known, though, whether those players can transfer to other schools facing sanctions and scholarship restrictions such as USC or Ohio State.
