Former Atlanta Falcons defensive back Bobby Butler, the father of Brice Butler, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Thursday that his son did not receive a “fair chance” to compete for playing time, while playing for USC coach Lane Kiffin, who replaced Pete Carroll in January 2010.
Brice Butler announced Wednesday he intended to transfer via Twitter, citing playing time as the primary reason for the decision:
“Always will be a part of trojan nation! No regrets, I just gotta go play fball, which isn’t happening here… I love all yall! Always will.”
In speaking with the media, the elder Butler not only told ACJ.com that he supported his son’s decision, saying it was the “right move,” but that he was also not given an equal opportunity for playing time:
“Lane Kiffin did not give Brice a fair chance … no, he did not give him a fair chance at all,” said Butler.
“You take a kid who is a starter, then the next thing you know you put a kid who has only been [in college practice] for 10 days and start him in front of [Butler]. They didn’t even play the same [wide receiver positions].
Robert Woods, who is referenced above, finished the season with 65 catches for 792 yards and six touchdowns.

Dear Mr. Butler,
Your son is not as good as Robert Woods. Maybe if your son worked harder in practice and wasn’t content with his “starter” position, then he would play. Thanks for the extra scholarship back. Good riddance.

Think of it as an NCAA championship preview.
The USC women’s tennis team is in Ann Arbor, Mich., to kick-off the opening rounds of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoors Championships.
“Indoor [tennis] is a whole different animal,” said USC head coach Richard Gallien.  “It’s a bit like baseball at Coors Field, the ball doesn’t spin as much and it just flies.”
For the Women of Troy, the tournament will be a whole different animal this year.
The top-ranked teams, usually including USC, host the opening rounds.
This year, however, the Women of Troy find themselves ranked 18th, and are forced to travel to earn their spot in the final 16.
“It’s a new experience for us,” Gallien said.  “But it’s a big chance for us to put on a little grizzle and toughness.”
Joining USC in Ann Arbor is No. 46 North Carolina State, with first serve scheduled for 7 a.m. PT on Saturday.
“That’s just the deal,” Gallien said. “We’ve been getting up early this whole week to try and acclimate ourselves.”
Assuming it wins, USC will face either No. 56 Auburn or No. 8 Michigan, who is hosting the four teams this weekend.
Despite the competition, coach Gallien feels pretty confident in his team.
“I’m a pretty conservative guy,” Gallien said.  “But I feel confident about NC St.”
The bigger challenge, he says, will come against Michigan.
“We don’t get 1,000 fans at our matches here,” he said.  “But there, indoors, they’ll have that.  It’ll be hairy.”
Nonetheless, Gallien remains confident in his squad.
“I think we’ll win.  We’re healthy and in good shape, and mentally in a good place.  I feel pretty good about it”
If the Women of Troy come away on top this weekend, they will advance to the official championships, to be held in three weeks at the University of Virginia.

Four-star offensive lineman Cyrus Hobbi (Scottsdale, Ariz.), the nation’s top guard prospect according to ESPN, announced his commitment to USC during a Friday afternoon press conference held at Saguargo High School and televised regionally on Fox Sports Arizona.
Hobbi had been deliberating between the Trojans and Arizona State and UCLA.
“I’ll be attending the University of Southern California,” Hobbi said in a story published on USCFootball.com. “It was a very difficult decision with all of the schools I had to choose from.”
“I was very impressed with all of the coaches and I had a great time meeting everybody, but at the end of the day going out there to USC, I knew it was the place for me. Walking out to the Coliseum and seeing all of these great, great players I’m going to be playing with soon with the recruiting class they’re going to be getting … we’re going to be good in the next couple of years.
“We’re going to start winning games. I’m very confident and very excited in my decision to go to USC.”
With holes on the offensive line stemming from the departures of starters Kristofer O’Dowd, Butch Lewis and Tyron Smith, Hobbi is expected to compete for a starting spot immediately.
I guess I’m wrong but I always thought the school newspaper, being part of the school, was not allowed to comment on recruits that have not yet signed with the school. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
