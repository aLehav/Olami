In July, USC unveiled a jointly funded program with Beijing’s China Scholarship Council that aims to provide two-year fellowships to international students looking to join a Ph.D. program at USC.
Overseen by the Office of Global Initiatives, the program hopes to provide fellowships this fall, with fellows receiving tuition and health insurance from USC. According to Anthony Bailey, vice provost of Global Initiatives, USC is the first university in the country to partner up with the CSC.
Bailey noted that China’s global impact is the main reason USC initiated the partnership.
“China has close to 20 percent of the world’s population and will greatly impact the future of humanity,” Bailey said.
Meredith Drake Reitan, assistant dean, is one of the leaders of the global fellowship programs at USC. Reitan noted that the partnership will bring bright individuals to the campus.
“With these fellowships, USC is able to attract the most highly recruited students in the world,”  Reitan said.
The university’s draw to global fellowships comes from USC’s overall academic goals for international students, according to Joyce Chao, director of USC’s Beijing Office.
“USC’s continuous rising reputation [is due to its] academic excellence, global initiatives and a well-known and welcoming environment for international students.”
Financial difficulties, however, have held back many international students. Sonia Gumuchian, a freshman international student from Canada majoring in writing for screen and television, said that scholarships are important for international students.
“Leaving home and adjusting to different financial expectations may be difficult for an international student who is unable to request financial aid,” Gumuchian said.
This collaboration with the CSC provides USC with a diverse group of doctoral candidates who have unique perspectives.
“As a global university, we are always looking to train the best minds who will solve the world’s future challenges,” Bailey said.

Over the summer, Lorenzo, the newest high-end housing project catering to USC students, partially opened to residents. While only the latest in a series of amenity-rich, university-unaffiliated housing complexes, Lorenzo is unique in that it boasts luxurious conditions, but also far from the center of campus. The building is located on W. Adams Boulevard, over half a mile from campus.
“A lot of parents want their students to be closer to campus. However, we do have tons of shuttles,” Lorenzo leasing agent Keyana Lavergme said. “We have three shuttles right now, and they run all day and all night.”
Lorenzo remains one of the most distant housing complexes from campus. Christopher Greenspan, director of asset management and investments at R. W. Selby & Co., the company in charge of Tuscany, an apartment complex located on S. Figueroa Street just south of Exposition Boulevard, highlighted location as a main benefit of the apartments at Tuscany.
“We offer something that others cannot offer,” he said. “For Tuscany, it is walking distance to the campus, and walking distance to the business school.”
For students, choosing where to live can be a decision that involves weighing factors such as practicality, location, price and amenities.
“I chose to live in Lorenzo because it had a ton of vacancies. Since I’m transferring, I was doing my housing months and months after everyone else,” Stephen Carr, an undeclared sophomore, said. “Now that I’m here, it’s pretty insane. It’s beautiful [inside], like a hotel.”
For Jennifer Michelman, a junior majoring in business, the choice also came down to both logistics and luxury.
“The main reason that I [chose to live in the Lorenzo] is because I’m going abroad next semester, so I needed to rent for six months,” Michelman said. “But I was also attracted to the amenities. It’s literally like living in a hotel.”
Rates at the Lorenzo run between $831 and $1,376 a month, or $4,155 and $6,880 for five months, the approximate length of a semester. Their smallest floor plan is approximately 700 square feet, and their largest about 1,300 according to its website.
USC also offers many housing options for those who choose not to live in buildings like Lorenzo and Tuscany. There are 18 university-owned apartment buildings for undergraduate upperclassmen. One popular option for housing is Cardinal Gardens, where an approximately 750 square foot apartment for four people costs $4,140 a semester, according to the USC Housing website. The complex, located on McClintock Ave., houses about 655 students.
Brooke Seegan, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, chose to live in university-owned Troy East for the convenience it provides.
“I didn’t want to have to deal with leasing an apartment or buying furniture or worrying if one of my roommates decided to study abroad,” Seegan said.
The cost of a semester at Troy East runs between $2,885 and $4,465.
While it offers furnished apartments, a workout room and study rooms, Troy East does not have the extra amenities that non-university housing often provides.
“We have a movie theater, we have a three-story gym with rock climbing and robes. We also have an outdoor pool, indoor pool and rooftop pool. We have saunas and steam rooms and cabanas,” Lavergme said of Lorenzo.
The proliferation of new apartment buildings also increases the competition for existing high-end housing options. According to leasing consultant Joey Hughes, University Gateway apartments, one of the first in the new wave of high-end apartment complexes, often has to adapt.
“As the demand changes, we have to change along with it. There’s always going to be new completion,” Hughes said.
He says Gateway, however, has two distinct benefits.
“Our location and our management. We care more,” Hughes said.
Many students, though, are not willing to pay more, even for the benefits expensive housing may provide.
“My big problem with the high-end USC housing options is not the options themselves as much as the options they replace,” Sam Vercauteran, a junior majoring in computer science, said. “I do not have any strong desire or the financial resources to stay at one of these places, and I know a lot of people feel the same way.”

USC’s fluxHome will compete in the Solar Decathlon, a biennial competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, this October at the Orange County Great Park.

FluxHome project manager Justin Kang, a USC alumnus of the School of Architecture, explains that, the contest means more than just winning to the DOE.
“For the DOE, this competition focuses on educating the public on sustainable living,” Kang said.
USC, however, uses this competition to allow students to go further than simply designing and developing projects, such as the fluxHome, by allowing for actual construction. This project provides a unique experience as students are required to build a fully electric home that is valued under $250,000, excluding land acquisition costs.
USC’s fluxHome is uncommon because it is the only entry designed for a family of four, as well as being the largest house in the competition.
The innovative design of the house uses natural weather as much as possible before using electricity to control the internal temperature and environment. The large operable skylights allow for natural ventilation, and the many windows and openings to the outside world create enough natural light to remove the need for electric lighting during the daylight hours.
“We wanted to create an affordable home and push the gap between indoor and outdoor,” said Christopher Flynn, recent USC School of Architecture graduate and construction manager for electrical, photo voltaic, lighting and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) responsibilities.
Along with an innovative design, the fluxHome also sports numerous green features such as sensors on each light that show how much energy it is using in dollars, so that people can track how much energy they use daily.
An especially exciting feature is the Crestion unit, which can sense when to turn on or turn off the air conditioning or heater. It can also hook up to an iPad.
“It augments everything in the house using keypads. It is helping the user get the best out of the house by measuring electricity and using everything responsibly,” Flynn said.
The competition allows students to focus on the numerous real-world issues that affect middle class housing through its 10 separate contests. Three of these contests relate to energy and efficiency as expected, while the rest extend to areas such as design, affordability, market appeal, communications and home entertainment.
“The cinematic arts students helped design the home entertainment system with the best and newest technology,” Kang said.
The project has also received plenty of attention from the community with organizations such as the LADWP and Southern California Edison giving strong support in addition to the money donations, labor, resources and materials from the design and construction community.
USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative program brought kids to the fluxHome where they were given a tour of the house and learned about what it means to be an architect. After the competition, Kim explained how the fluxHome is expected to tour several places both within the U.S. and abroad, after which it will be donated to a family in the area surrounding USC.
“It shows you that there are affordable ways to help the environment while still living comfortably and luxuriously,” Maite Christi Francois, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience said.
All Solar Decathlon entries will be open to the public during the competition, from Oct. 3-6 and 10-13 at Orange County Great Park in Irvine, Calif.
I don’t even understand how I ended up right here, but I believed this put up was great. I don’t

This fall, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will offer a minor in Iranian studies through a partnership with the Farhang Foundation in Los Angeles.
The establishment of the minor is part of a multiphase process to establish an Iranian studies program at USC. The first phase began last year, when the university offered its first Persian language classes.
According to NPR, Southern California boasts the largest population of Iranians outside Iran, roughly 500,000. UCLA, another large Southern California school, already has a Persian studies program.
“UCLA has a Persian studies major so it’s about time that USC became involved in the Persian community, especially with all the resources available around us,” Emily Zolfaghari, secretary for USC’s Iranian Student Organization, said.
Zolfaghari hopes to work for Doctors Without Borders in the Middle East, where she believes her Persian language studies will help her.
While support for USC’s program exceeded expectations, it was necessary for the program to expand gradually to ensure that there was a demand for the classes and support within the Iranian-American community, according to Haleh Emrani, chair of Farhang’s Iranian Studies Council.
“It was important to make sure USC — which is one of the most important universities in Southern California with the largest number of Iranian diaspora students — has an Iranian studies program,” Ali Razi, chair of the Farhang Foundation Board of Trustees, said.
According to Emrani, the classes received an overwhelming response.
“After we established the Persian language classes and they were received well by the student body, we realized that the time was right for the second part of the process to be implemented.”
Professor Hani Khafipour, who previously taught at the University of Chicago, will join the Dornsife staff this semester to teach three courses in Iranian history, arts and culture that the minor will consist of.
Khafipour said he hopes to help his students change their thought processes to focus less on the differences between Iran and America that are often emphasized in the media today.
“The time has come to move away from this outdated framework and obstructive perspective,” Khafipour said. “I would like to encourage my students to distance their thoughts from such attitudes, challenge their assumptions, orient their viewpoint toward finding commonalities between the countries and to think critically about how to build new ways of developing relationships.”
Emrani said the third phase of the process will be the establishment of an endowed chair in Iranian Studies, which would allow for the creation of a major in the subject.
Steven Lamy, Dornsife’s vice dean for academic programs, said the university is not rushing to create a major because they want to ensure that they can offer students a quality program first.
“We don’t create a major unless we have the faculty expertise as well as student interest,” he said. “We’re hoping this will attract students, then eventually we can create a major.”
Hootan Omidvar, a junior majoring in psychology, said he initially took classes because of his Iranian heritage. He is planning to pursue degrees in clinical psychology and business, but he enjoyed the Farsi classes so much he is considering the Iranian studies minor as well.
“If I pursue clinical psychology, I could have a niche of clients that are Persian,” he said. “I could more effectively communicate with them and understand them better because understanding their language leads to a deeper understanding of them emotionally. In business, any language skill makes for a more effective entrepreneur.”
According to Emrani, the main purpose behind this specific effort at USC is to bring some level of knowledge to the community at large about Iran and Iranian culture.
“We’re not only bringing the two communities together and the cultures together but we’re providing a set of skills for students to participate in the global economy,” Emrani said. “If students become familiar with cultures that may not be as well-known to them, it will lead to a more compassionate world.”
This will be nothing less than a pure propaganda exercise
where no dissent will be allowed… just like in Iran. Great.
Just what we need. Thanks, USC. More “pawns” who spout
dogmatic, hateful diatribes without considering the overall
Picture. Pathetic. Sad. Trojans deserve better than this.
Where are the Trojan women
& WHY AREN’T THEY STANDING UP TO THIS?
Iranian women are nothing but chattel. Pieces of property
with virtually no rights in a male dominated society. Their
God given rights are abused, ignored, & trampled upon by
Mu-SLIME. Fact: Mohammad was a drunken religious zealot
who learned how to manipulate human beings by FEAR &
INTIMIDATION. Why would this have ANY place at USC?
Unless we have become a College of Cowards.

On Jan. 13, 1923, Alpha Gamma Delta first planted its roots at USC. Now, after a 30-year hiatus following its decision to disband, the sorority will move back to W. 28th Street come fall semester.
Renovation · The new Alpha Gamma Delta house on The Row is under construction. AGD will begin hosting meetings there in the spring. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though the sorority was forced to close its doors three decades ago due to low membership, both USC’s Panhellenic Council and AGD’s National Directors said they have high hopes for the new house.
“As [AGD] come[s] home to USC, the women who join Alpha Gamma Delta at USC this fall will have the unique experience of simultaneously getting to be a part of a long and significant history for both USC and Alpha Gamma Delta, while also getting to establish what Alpha Gamma Delta at USC will be known for in the years to come,” Annie Raeder, assistant director of fraternity services, at AGD’s national headquarter, said..
Roxie Friberg, the president of the PHC for the upcoming year, said she is excited for the return of AGD, as it will provide girls with an opportunity to become leaders in Greek life.
“This year is especially unique for new members [of USC Greek life],” Friberg said. “Girls can become founding members [of AGD], which is a wonderful leadership experience.”
Because the sorority has a history at USC, it will be able to incorporate its alumni into its recruitment efforts and on-campus events.
“Throughout the year, our alumnae and collegiate members will come together for events like football games, parents weekends, Town and Gown, the Greek Gala and several other campus traditions,” Raeder said.
Since there hasn’t been a new sorority chapter established on campus since Sigma Delta Tau in 2007, welcoming AGD onto The Row will be a somewhat new experience for the Greek community.
To help acclimate AGD into both the Greek and USC communities, Friberg is helping the sorority reserve classrooms for meetings and connect with campus organizations.
“We [the PHC] are placing a strong emphasis on growing our community while developing lasting relationships with student organizations and the campus administration, in order to be more directly involved with the school,” Friberg said.
Though Alpha Gamma Delta will not be participating in formal recruitment this fall, they will hold informal recruitment events after formal recruitment has concluded.
“Ultimately, [the return of AGD] means even more options for USC women who choose to go Greek,” said Kimberly Barnhill, vice president of communications on the Panhellenic Council. “It also means more opportunities for USC women to explore Greek life outside of the formal recruitment process this year, as Alpha Gamma Delta will begin its recruitment process after formal recruitment has ended.”
The sorority is planning on switching to formal recruitment next fall.
“During their first year, [AGD] will be observing the [Greek] community and the interaction we have with the campus so they can become fully integrated by the following year with a formal recruitment process,” Friberg said.
AGD is eagerly anticipating their return to USC.  The girls already in AGD believe the sorority won’t just benefit members, but also the community around campus.
“The way we describe it in Alpha Gamma Delta is that we ‘Live with Purpose,’” Raeder said. “Our members will strive to be the best versions of themselves and seek to make positive impacts in the community. And we are so excited to get to do that here as part of the Trojan Family.”
AGD’s house on The Row, located on 729 W. 28th St., is currently undergoing renovations. According to Raeder, the house will be inhabitable in fall 2014, and sorority meetings will be held there starting in the spring of 2014.
Informational meetings for potential members begin on Sept. 3, but most informal recruitment activities will happen during the beginning of October. Bid Day, celebrating new members, will take place on Oct. 13.

Not 30 years ago!  Way to make me feel old.  Try 27.  I was the last and only pledge in the final pledge class of 1986.
The Alpha Gamma Delta house closed at the end of the 1986 fall semester, so that was not 30 years ago but less than 27. Let’s not age us all more than necessary. ;)
Good luck to the revived chapter!
I’m so excited for AGD!  Best of luck!

Summer construction on the Wallis Annenberg Hall, Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, the School of Cinematic Arts’ Media Arts+Practice building and other buildings will continue into the fall semester on USC’s University Park campus.
“Of the 56 projects that were in construction at the end of May and scheduled for completion by the beginning of the fall semester … 22 have been completed and placed into service and the remaining 34 are also scheduled to be complete for the beginning of the fall semester,” John Harmer, associate vice president of USC Capital Construction, said.
These projects are the latest installments of USC’s rebuilding campaign, which will undertake even more ambitious projects, such as the renovation of University Village, in the years to come.
While USC students expressed annoyance at navigating campus while construction takes place, they are also excited about the benefits the completed buildings will bring.
“It is very inconvenient both to walk and also to drive around campus with everything sectioned off,” Colburn Trutter, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said. “But I also believe that construction is a good sign. It shows initiative taken by the school to try and improve its campus.”
Among the largest of the facilities that will be open for the start of the fall term is a 62,000 square-foot addition to the School of Cinematic Arts on the corner of McClintock and 34th Street. The addition will house both the Institute for Multimedia Literacy, a minor program within the School of Cinematic Arts, and the Interactive Media Division.
The IML Institute began in 1998, founded by School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daly with the help of George Lucas. The opening of the new facility in June drew attention from alumni and influential supporters of the USC Cinematic Arts program.
Filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg as well as Zynga CEO Don Mattrick attended a gala reception at the IML building on July 10 to showcase Christie® MicroTiles®, an innovative visual display technology that presents educational information and entertainment interactively. The Microtiles on the walls of the new IML building give a higher resolution than conventional LCD and plasma screen displays.
Kaelin Sanders, a senior majoring in business administration, is concerned that flagship improvements like the new IML facility are not spread equally across different departments.
“It’s nice to see that USC is so focused on quickly improving the campus’ facilities for students,” Sanders said. “[But] I can’t help but feel the projects that the university undertakes have too narrow of a focus… It seems misguided to commit to such large improvements when so few students will be able to utilize the new resources.”
Construction on the 34 ongoing undertakings will finish at various times. One of the largest projects, Wallis Annenberg Hall, is scheduled to open in the fall of 2014.

Former USC professor Walter Lee Williams was arrested in Mexico on June 18, ending his time on the FBI’s Most Wanted fugitives list.
The arrest came after Williams was indicted for alleged sexual crimes against children. Williams, a former anthropology, history and gender studies professor, arrived in Los Angeles the following day.
According to Bill Lewis, assistant director in the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, a Mexican citizen recognized Williams’ picture in the newspaper and reported him to local authorities.
Williams has been charged with a four-count indictment that alleges sexual exploitation of children and traveling abroad for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts with children.
More specifically, the indictment alleges crimes with two 14-year-olds that Williams contacted over the Internet. The FBI said in a statement that Williams is being indicted for allegedly having “engaged in sexual activity via Internet webcam sessions with the boys and expressing a desire to visit them in the Philippines to have sex.”
When Williams returned from the Philippines in January of 2011, the FBI moved in. By the time they recovered photographic evidence from Williams’ laptop, he had fled the country.
Williams departed USC suddenly in February of 2011, when he fled to Mexico after learning of the investigation against him.
As a scholar, Williams gained a reputation as a renowned author  in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender academia. Williams started the Gay and Lesbian Review in 1996, and worked to build the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at USC. During his time at the university, Williams also served as an adviser for several student organizations, including the Lambda Grads, Shades of Troy, and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Assembly.
According to the FBI, Williams used his academic work as an excuse to visit countries that turn a blind eye to child prostitution. Furthermore, renowned lesbian journalist Karen Ocamb, who published an article after the FBI listed Williams on its Most Wanted list, wrote that Williams was “well-known for making passes at his students at USC — some of whom made official complaints.”
The allegations of such a history are surprisingly well-documented. According to Ocamb, Williams was rumored to have slept with many of his underage sources for his award-winning book, The Spirit and the Flesh.
“I knew about Walter’s [alleged] pedophilia many years ago via [LGBTQ scholar] Harry Hay and others in the gay Native [American] community who Walter used as sources in his Spirit and the Flesh book. His reputation was not good back then,” Ocamb quoted an anonymous source as saying.
When asked to comment on any previous investigations into Williams’ conduct, University Counsel Kelly Bendell said that the university us looking into the allegations. “By law, personnel matters are confidential. However, I can confirm that the university takes this matter very seriously and cooperated fully with the FBI during its investigation,” Bendall said.
The university released a statement about the investigation earlier this summer.
“The FBI has informed us that at this time there is no evidence that any of his alleged illegal activities were associated with the university or took place on campus,” part of the release said.
The FBI also noted that none of the explicit images were stored on USC property and that an investigation of Williams’ office at the university revealed no evidence of criminal activity on campus.
Williams faces up to 100 years in prison if convicted as presently charged.

Statistics show that the incoming class of 2017 is the most selective and competitive class in USC’s history. The class was chosen out of the largest pool ever, 47,300 applications.
USC accepted less than 19.7 percent of applicants, a slight decrease from last year, were accepted. The average SAT score rose substantially, about eight to 10 points, according to Director of Admissions Kirk Brennan.
The university also saw an increase in international student applicants, especially students from India. The new Marshall World Bachelor of Business program attracted international students as well.
“The more diverse the student body in the classroom and in the community, the better the education and the stronger the student will be,” Brennan said.
Domestically, roughly 33 percent of students are from southern California.
In addition to being a statistically impressive upcoming class, the students also boast a wide range of interests and talents.
Aaron Spiro, a music industry major, is one of those students. Spiro and high school friend Adam Novodor produced a remix of Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” that was featured as a bonus track on Thicke’s Target Deluxe edition of the album. KIIS FM, a local radio station, recently played the track on air.
Spiro and Novodor formed a music production company, Bee’s Knees, and were recently invited by Warner Bros. to remix “My Gun” by the Australian band The Rubens.
“My favorite part of being a producer is reaching milestones, like being featured on ‘Blurred Lines,’” Spiro said. “I chose USC because of the wonderful music industry program at Thornton and because USC is located in the heart of the music industry.”
Alya Omar, majoring in international relations (global business), volunteered in 2011 at an Egyptian special needs orphanage that had financially collapsed after the revolution.
Omar and her mother, who have family in Egypt, raised more than $1,200 for the orphanage and then flew to Cairo to visit.
“The best thing about that place was being able to look at that kind of heartache and of instead of wishing I could do something, it was knowing that I did,” Omar said.
The impressive array of talent that the class of 2017 exhibits will provide USC with well-rounded individuals aiming to make a difference, on campus and off.
Yes, maybe the best academically but likely the most socially awkward as well.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) launched an investigation on June 26 into cases of alleged sexual assault of three university students, making USC one of over twenty schools to come under scrutiny for its response to sexual violence.
The investigation, which came after students filed a federal complaint on May 22, will seek to determine whether or not the university violated students’ civil rights under Title IX, a federal law against gender discrimination.

OCR guidelines state that all complaints must be filed within 180 calendar days of the alleged discrimination. In an email to the Daily Trojan, Title IX Coordinator and Office of Equity and Diversity Director Jody Shipper said that once a complaint is accepted, the OCR will work with the school to get information about the allegations before reaching a final conclusion.
“We have always worked collaboratively with the Department of Education, and plan to do so in any future cases filed,” Shipper said.
Sexual assault, as defined by section 11.53 of the SCAMPUS Student Guidebook, is “non consensual actual or attempted intercourse, sexual touching, fondling and/or groping.” The same classification is applied to rape when “vaginal, anal or oral penetration takes place without the consent of the person penetrated.” In both cases, SCAMPUS states that culpability is not diminished when the perpetrator is intoxicated or under the influence of illegal or controlled substances.
In light of the launch of the federal investigation, students in the university’s Student Coalition Against Rape (SCAR) held a news conference on July 22 to publicly detail their complaints. The conference was led by 23-year-old Tucker Reed, a student who filed a sexual assault complaint last November before publicly naming her alleged rapist via her blog in March.
“I blogged openly about the details of my rape and the university’s abuses,” Reed said at the conference, “and watched as my inbox filled with messages from fellow students who had experienced the same injustices and the same silencing.”
SCAR Co-Founder and Title IX complainant Alexa Schwartz said that it was only until they came together that they realized they all shared the same grievances.
“We are a group of survivors and allies who have seen a lot of wrongdoing in a particular department,” Schwartz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We don’t have a vendetta against USC as a whole, but in order to raise attention to this we had to do what we had to do because our voices weren’t being heard.”
Schwartz said the goal isn’t to eliminate the university’s party culture, but rather to make it more safe.
“This isn’t about taking away people’s fun. It’s about recognizing that if you’re not creating a safe environment for people, that’s not fun for anybody,” Schwartz said.
The university released a statement July 22 confirming that it had been notified of the complaints of Title IX violations and the subsequent investigation by the OCR.
“The university is strongly committed to upholding all aspects of Title IX,” Shipper said in the statement. “The opening of an investigation is an expected step in the process, and the OCR states that ‘opening the allegations for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination with regard to their merits.”
Four days later, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett issued a statement to the USC community reaffirming the university’s zero tolerance policy on issues of sexual misconduct.
“In light of recent news stories about an inquiry by the OCR concerning the cases of three USC students, I am writing to underscore what our university does to protect our campus community in this realm,” Garrett said in a statement.
Garrett also addressed inaccuracies in the media’s reporting.
“There are not 100 students who have complained to the federal government about the process, as some have claimed,” Garrett said. “Instead, a student alleged that USC had not responded appropriately in 16 cases; the OCR accepted three of those cases for further investigation.”
Comments allegedly made by a Dept. of Public Safety officer to Ariella Mostov, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television, also sparked media attention. According to a report by the Huffington Post, Mostov said that campus police dismissed her claims of rape because “her alleged assailant did not orgasm.”
DPS Chief John Thomas dismissed the alleged comments, reaffirming that DPS takes all reports of sexual assault very seriously.
“A student who filed a report of sexual assault with DPS alleged in the press that an officer made an extremely offensive comment and failed to follow proper protocol,” Thomas said in a statement issued July 26.
Due to the ongoing investigation, both DPS and the Office of Equity and Diversity denied further comment.

When I first came to USC, oh, about 5 years ago, I was shocked at something I observed. I was standing outside the Leavey library some time in the evening, when it was dark. There were plenty of students hanging out, near the pool, throwing frisbies on the quad, etc. It was the beginning of the fall semester, so there was no stress from midterms or finals. It was late summer, still warm at night, and everything was chill. Then I see a small group of students walking by, maybe 4 if I recall correctly: 2 guys and 2 girls. One of the guys aggressively grabs one of the girls, his g/f I presume, and seemed like he was trying to mack on her. Then I remember, she retorted something like, “get off me!…I’m not having sex with you!” I was shocked, but minded my own business. I’m not gonna play captain-save-a-ho; well, I didn’t mean to disrespect that girl by referring to her as a “ho.” But if some of you girls got b/f’s who can’t hold their liquor or can’t keep their junk in their pants, then maybe you need to stop seeing him.
A crime is a crime and SC has no business investigating alleged rapes or any other felony level crimes.   If your bike gets stolen, call DPS.  If your virginity is stolen, call LAPD!
Sorry for partying
You are disgusting.
Thanks for writing, Yasmeen! I enjoyed meeting with you.
Some clarifications: the provost letter did not reaffirm USC’s zero-tolerance policy. It mentioned USC having “no tolerance,” but does not say zero tolerance. Secondly, of the sixteen named complainants, three cases were accepted for individual investigation on the condition that the complainants’ names would be given to the university and that the case was within a 180-day statute of limitation. Three complainants’ cases met those guidelines, but that does not mean the other 13 do not merit an investigation. Their concerns inform the investigators about the university’s system as a whole.

Before Eric Garcetti became Mayor Garcetti at his inauguration on June 30, many USC students knew him by a slightly more academic title: Professor Garcetti.
Heated Debate · Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti debates former mayoral candidate Wendy Greuel at the Galen Center on May 5. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
A visiting instructor at USC’s School of International Relations from 1998 to 2000, Garcetti taught a class on humanitarian intervention and human rights, as well as a course on developing countries in world politics. While teaching at USC, Garcetti helped form a chapter of University Watch, a program of Human Rights Watch, and brought a group of students to meet then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, according to the School of International Relations’ alumni magazine.
While his tenure at USC might have been short, Garcetti has had a long relationship with the university.
In fact, Garcetti has appointed some of his former USC students to serve as city commissioners, he said during an interview with the Daily Trojan, and came back to campus in 2003 to deliver the commencement address for the School of International Relations. As a three-term city councilman representing Hollywood, Echo Park and other communities, Garcetti said he worked with USC on everything from homelessness to rebranding Los Angeles.
But, for at least the next four years, Garcetti will work with USC in a more direct capacity as Los Angeles’s leader.
And as newly elected politicians adjust to their new roles in city government, so too must USC and other stakeholders.
“[A change in government] does affect the university because even though we’ve known a lot of these folks for years, they’re in a new role,” David Galaviz, USC’s executive director for local government relations, said. “We have to reach out to them, we have to be proactive in explaining to them USC’s role, both as a community partner and a partner with local government.”
The university’s lobbying efforts extend far past the mayor’s office. Perhaps no one is as important as the university district’s city councilman, Curren Price, who, after working as a state legislator for seven years, is beginning his first term as Ninth District City Councilman.
Since taking office, Price has met with university officials to discuss USC’s $1.1 billion renovation of the University Village and a project to improve the Figueroa Corridor. Last March, Price served as the keynote speaker for a student leadership conference hosted as part of USC’s EdMonth.
“I think ‘SC brings a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of intellectual power to problems and to opportunities in the area,” he said during an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Overall, it’s a very positive resource and we hope it continues being a good neighbor for the community and the businesses that surround it.”
Price said that he’s looking forward to working with the university, noting several shared priorities: beautification, public safety, economic development and youth empowerment.
Garcetti is also focused on youth empowerment. Since Garcetti’s tenure at USC, the university has become increasingly active in civic life, he said.
“I think that every year USC becomes more and more integrated, not only with their neighborhood, but with the city of Los Angeles in the wider sense,” Garcetti said.
When it comes to city politics, USC has considerable influence.
“The university has access,” Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the USC Price School of Public Policy, said. “And you don’t ignore the largest employer in the city of Los Angeles. That doesn’t mean you cave in every time that employer breathes. But that employer will certainly get a hearing.”
Several of Garcetti’s commission appointments have USC affiliations, Jeffe noted. On Aug. 14, Garcetti named Steve Soboroff, who sits on the Price School’s Board of Councilors, to the commission that oversees the police department. Robert Saltzman, associate dean and professor at the Gould School of Law, already serves on the panel.
But Galaviz said his office is careful not to treat USC-affiliated officials differently in its interactions with the city.
“We have to approach them like any other constituent,” Galaviz said. “We cannot assume nor do we think that just because a certain community leader has a tie to the university they’re going to do everything the university wants.”
When an issue does arise, Galaviz said the first call is always to the university’s councilmember, one reason forming a strong relationship is so crucial. Over the next few years, USC will collaborate with the city on priorities as small as fixing potholes and as large as the University Village renovation, Galaviz said.
Price, like Garcetti, isn’t new to working with USC. Recently, as a California state senator, Price criticized an agreement that gives USC a 98-year lease to manage the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Though he supported USC managing the Coliseum, Price was part of a group of critics concerned that museums in Exposition Park would suffer from a loss of parking revenue during several university events. Since the letter was written, Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration has said the state plans to compensate the museums.
“My concern was there would be some reimbursement, either from the state, the university or from somewhere,” Price said. “These are important cultural resources in the community and we didn’t want to turn over the Coliseum to ‘SC at the expense of decreased access by citizens.”
The Coliseum isn’t the only area where the university and the city have worked together. In recent years, public safety has become an issue that has required greater collaboration with the city. After an on-campus shooting in October, the university installed additional gating around campus and placed restrictions on visitors after 9 p.m.
Though Garcetti said safety in South Los Angeles has improved in recent years, his administration plans to do more work in the area.
“I do believe it’s tremendously safe,” Garcetti said. “Certainly compared to 20 years ago, 10 years ago, it’s better. But there’s still too much crime concentrated in South Los Angeles and it will be a focus of mine, particularly with youth intervention and gang intervention, to give young people other pathways.”
Despite USC’s efforts to extend its reach beyond the University Park Campus, many students remain reluctant to get involved in city life. After all, turnout in the mayoral election stayed at a low 10.2 percent for 18-29 year olds, according to an exit poll sponsored by Loyola Marymount University.
Garcetti hopes to change that. As mayor, he plans to make volunteering easier by creating a forum that lists opportunities. But he also said he recognizes that increased involvement requires a change in attitude.
“L.A. is a complicated place to get engaged and involved civically but it’s my goal that not only do we build an easier way to do that but we build a new culture,” he said.
As for USC, Garcetti hopes that the university’s presence continues to increase beyond its campus gates.
“The university is much less of an island than it’s ever been,” Garcetti said. “But it’s still too much of an island. It reaches its arms out regularly, but I want to see ways in which, specifically with City Hall, we can engage graduate students and professors in coming up with the solutions to problems we all face.”

To better serve its mission of preparing students to work in the best newsrooms around the world, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is shortening its master’s degree program in journalism from two years to nine months.
Learning styles · Sophomore public relations major Jessica Dillion prepares for class at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. – Jasmine Rolle | Daily Trojan
The change comes in response to shifting demands from employers in the news industry.
“One of the things that we do from time to time is we go out and look at what’s happening in the industry — where do our students go, what do they need, what do the news organizations say they want in a young journalist,” Michael Parks, interim director of the School of Journalism said. “We did that a couple of years ago, and we got back a set of things that said to us that we needed to change the program.”
This information, along with the construction of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall and input from students that a one-year program would be better suited to their needs, led to the idea of a shorter, more intensive program. The new program will be centered on workshops and skill-based learning as opposed to the traditional classroom environment. Plans for the program are underway, and Parks expects them to be completed by the start of the spring semester.
The program begins in the summer with a three-week long “boot camp” that covers basic skills in print, digital and broadcast journalism. The fall semester consists mainly of assignments in the media center, which include writing for Neon Tommy and other media outlets, to emphasize developing skills quickly. In the spring, the program shifts to more advanced applications of these skills.
The new program will also include the study of the media industry and journalism as a practice. Some new classes to be offered are a course on the business of journalism and “Numbers in the News,” a course on the use of data in storytelling.
Parks said that no new hires have been made so far, but there will be some changes in teaching assignments and possibly some new adjunct faculty brought on to facilitate the change.
“We have great resources here in Los Angeles and a great deal of excitement about this program,” Parks said.
One of the main focuses of the new program is to make students comfortable working across different media platforms in a converged newsroom.
“Working in a converged newsroom forces you to think not, ‘How can I do this story for TV, or for radio or print?’ but, ‘How can we do the best job we can on this story?’ [and] ‘How can we tell it in the most compelling way?” Gabriel Kahn, professor of professional practice at Annenberg, said.
The construction of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall is central to the success of the program. The new building will allow the different campus media outlets, from Neon Tommy to Annenberg Radio News, to work together in the “converged newsroom” that employers say they want students to be comfortable in.
The idea of the converged newsroom has become crucial because of the changing dynamics in the news industry, which are mostly because of increased use of technology by journalists.
“The industry itself is in a moment of tremendous transformation, which in the short term is great for the consumer but is brutal for the industry as they struggle for new ways to create value,” Kahn said. “If the industry is changing so quickly, then our programs should change even more quickly.”
In particular, the ubiquity of consumer technology has led to a breakdown of the traditional structure of most news organizations.
“Traditionally, if I’m sitting in my living room, I’m watching television journalism. If I’m in my car, I’m listening to radio journalism and in the morning when I sit down with a newspaper, that’s print journalism,” Kahn said. “That division is increasingly irrelevant, because if I’m using my iPad, I can consume all those forms of journalism on one device.”
The goal of the program is to make sure that students maintain the values and ethics of journalism while still being literate in the new technological tools available.
“The focus of the program is not teaching people how to use gadgets, but how to tell compelling stories using whatever gadgets might be relevant in the moment,” Kahn said.
