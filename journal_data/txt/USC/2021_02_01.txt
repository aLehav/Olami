It seemed like a cold day in hell. But actually, it was warm, sunny and in a different h-place: Huntington Beach, Calif. The first day of May brought Trump-flag-waving, “freedom is essential”-poster-holding anti-maskers from all stretches of Orange and Los Angeles counties to protest California’s stay at home order on Huntington Beach’s Main Street.
More than a thousand mostly white, conservative people decided that after a month and a half of coronavirus restrictions (remember way back when?) that it was time for things to end. One attendee spoke with the LAist and summed up the protestors’ purpose quite well:
“Well, because I believe that a lot of people had preexisting conditions that they would have died anyway,” Luke Czaplinski told the LAist. “And this was a little bit a sprinkle of some kind of a sickness that maybe helped them die faster. But a lot of people that were going to die anyway ended up dying.”
It turns my stomach to read that now. Beyond the political makeup of the city, Huntington Beach is also a mecca for surfing in California. It frequently hosts the U.S. Open of Surfing and is home to surfing greats like Kanoa Igarashi. The combination of beach lovers and Gov. Gavin Newsom haters presaged a likely public health disaster that brought a surge of coronavirus restrictions down on all Orange County cities.
The weekend of April 25-27 brought thousands of people to the county’s beaches with perfect heatwave conditions and the ansty haste to get out of the house after over a month of some of the strictest lockdown rules. The showing was almost flagrant, and Newsom acted quickly to shut it down further.
At that point, the governor allowed the counties to decide what to enforce in terms of park and beach closures. In Southern California, Orange County was the only one that allowed its  beaches to stay open, until a statewide memo ordered the shutdown of all of these facilities by May 1. 
Newsom wasn’t afraid to point fingers, reminiscent of the “this is who ruined it for everyone else” mantra you learn early in preschool. After seeing the beachgoers refuse to wear masks or social distance, he made it clear that at that point in time, the situation was too tenuous to brush restrictions off like you would the sand on your feet.
“This virus doesn’t go home because it’s a beautiful, sunny day along our coast,” Newsom said in a news briefing covered by SURFER Magazine. “We can’t see the images like we saw, particularly on Saturday in Newport Beach and elsewhere.”
Closures of beaches in the early months of the pandemic also meant beachgoers were barred from activities such as swimming, boogie boarding and surfing. At my home break in Manhattan Beach, an Instagram story of a police truck warning of surfers’ potential arrests went viral, with one being fined $1,000 (the irony of the police officers in most of these reports not wearing masks is not lost on me). 
Despite engendering some of the greatest headlines and merch, including a Mercury News crime report titled “California surfer in handcuffs after enjoying empty, epic waves” and “Newsom Don’t Surf” shirts for any occasion, many people complied with the orders because it was, and still is, the right thing to do to prevent further devastation in a pandemic.
But now a new sort of responsibility has fallen on surfers and beachgoers of California and beyond. What are they doing now that a stay at home order is mistakenly lifted while the case numbers keep surging?
SURFER’s Zander Morton delivered some of the best editorial I’ve seen from the pandemic era, writing about how locals in Australia and in Santa Cruz, Calif. were urging people from out of town to stay away from their beaches. In fact, Orange County residents blamed out-of-towners for the beaches getting shut down in a marvelous display of that one Spider-Man-pointing-fingers meme. 
Some call the return to localism dangerous and the use of the coronavirus to defend it irresponsible. But besides this messaging, what does it take for people to stay out of cities and breaks that are experiencing some of the worst of the pandemic’s effects?
It comes down to personal responsibility and empathy— which may or may not still exist— to decide that going down South, over to Hawai’i or out of the country to Bali is something that can wait until after the pandemic ends (whether it is a good choice at all is a topic for another column). 
And this is regardless of how much PPE you wear, how much you’re social distancing or how many negative tests you get. With the absence of clear coronavirus guidance from pretty much everyone and many of the disease’s various facets still to be revealed in terms of its ability to spread and our ability to develop immunity, it’s better to be safe. It’s more respectful to the people, the land and the cooperative spirit of surfing as well. 
Lauren Mattice is a senior writing about surfing. She is also the digital managing editor at the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Spring Swell,” runs every other Monday.

The pandemic halted the start of the Fall 2020 tennis season. Now, USC tennis is back on the courts and showcasing their hard work after a long hiatus. 
As the 2020 ITA Champions, the men’s tennis team intends to run it back and add additional accolades this season. Despite one of their top stars graduating, former All-American Brandon Holt, the Trojans are still playing at the highest level in collegiate tennis. 
They are off to a phenomenal start so far. Currently, the team is ranked No.1 as an overall team while also having the No. 1 Singles player senior Daniel Cukierman and No. 1 Doubles team with redshirt senior Riley Smith and Cukierman. With so much talent on the roster, the team is looking to take down any hurdle that comes their way.
“We lost Brandon, which was a big piece, but maintaining guys like Riley and Daniel, and the rest of the guys that we [have] on this team and adding a few —that’s a big reason for [our No. 1 ranking],” head coach Brett Masi said. “But, every team out there is going to be good this year, just like any other year, and we got to go out and prove it every day.”
After starting the season with some easy wins at the Pepperdine Invite against the Pepperdine Waves and Loyola Marymount Lions to start the season, the Trojans went on to win all their games again this last week.
The ITA Kickoff Weekend, which ran from Jan. 23 to 25,  hosted Cal, UNLV, and USC’s crosstown rival No. 18 UCLA. USC played UNLV and UCLA during the tournament and easily knocked off the Bruins 4-1 in the tournament’s championship game.
The most notable matchup was between No. 1 Cukierman and UCLA senior No. 10 Keegan Smith. Cukierman fell down early, losing the first set 4-6, but came back to win the last two sets 6-2, 6-1. 
On Friday, USC hosted LMU at Marks Stadium where the Trojans swept their opponents in all matchups. That made the Trojans 2-0 against the Lions this season. 
So far, USC is undefeated in singles play, going 32-0. They have kept up their momentum from last season and haven’t looked back.
“It’s nice just to be back out on the courts. I’ve been telling the guys all along, we’ve just got to find our groove again because it has been so long since a lot of us have competed,” Masi said. “The expectations as the season goes on are going to be raised up.”
The men’s team will face Saint Mary’s, Boise State and San Diego State this weekend. After that, the team is looking to repeat as champions at the 2021 ITA National Indoors Championship on Feb. 12. 
USC’s women’s team is also having a strong start to the season. Ranked No. 17 at the  start of their campaign, the Trojans headed over to Malibu to play in the ITA Kickoff Weekend last week where they won their first game against Denver Pioneers in a dominant 4-1 win. 
The match was delayed due to rainy weather, but the Trojans came out flying with the No. 12 duo of redshirt senior Angela Kulikov and sophomore Erin Cayetano winning their matchup against No. 36 pairing of junior Taylor Melville and senior Hada Chang. 
Unfortunately for USC, in the championship game against No. 5 Pepperdine the Trojans fell 2-4 against the Waves. 
No. 48 Cayetano dropped a match against No. 33 graduate student and former Trojan Jessica Failla, losing 6-2, 3-6, 7-5. Similarly, newcomer No. 103 freshman Naomi Cheong put up an impressive fight against the No. 1 graduate student Ashley Lahey, almost beating Lahey in a tiebreaker in the second set. However, Lahey prevailed, winning 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4. 
The women’s team plans to shake off their losses at the ITA National Indoors tournament this weekend in Stillwater, Oklahoma. 
Overall, Trojans tennis is off to a fantastic start this season and both teams performances thus far give USC fans reason to be optimistic.

Sophomore guard Endyia Rogers shined while scoring a career-high 30 points in the Trojan’s  Sunday victory over ASU. The final score was 65-57, and USC appeared comfortable on their home court against the Sun Devils. With the win, the team improves to 7-7 overall and 5-6 in Pac-12 play.
Rogers landed a buzzer-beater to give USC a 21-11 lead after 10 minutes of play in the first quarter. The game was Rogers’s 10th straight double digit scoring performance.
The Trojans started the first and second quarter strong and appeared almost unable to miss from beyond the arc, shooting 8-11 from the 3-point line. USC kept the pace going on the defensive end with quick rotations and timely turnovers on defense. ASU struggled to keep up, and by halftime, USC earned a 40-23 lead.
“We defended well and hit big shots, I was really happy with the intensity and the leadership,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We’re going to keep this going.” 
Sophomore forward Alyssa Pili and redshirt sophomore Shalexxus Aaron both returned to the court Sunday after missing time due to injuries. 
Aaron worked well with Rogers as a recipient of the high low plays. Aaron was 3-for-3 from behind the arc and hit major shots that got the Trojans going in an early run. Aaron scored in double digits for the first time since a 17-point outing on March 3, 2019, marking Sunday’s game as a major come-back for her. 
“It meant a lot. I’ve been a part of three injuries above my foot along with knee surgery and spraining my ankle, so I definitely felt it at half time for sure,” Aaron said after the game. “Getting the team win overall was a victory itself of course.  I love basketball, and I love being on the court so that was a victory for myself as well too but I think the team win conquers everything overall.” 
ASU adjusted at the half and scored 8-0 straight out of the shoot in the third quarter. The Sun Devils continued to chip away at USC’s substantial lead, but the Trojans never allowed ASU back to secure a comeback. The third quarter started slow but the Trojans still found their rhythm eventually and held onto their lead.
The final quarter began with a ten point difference between the teams — the closest of the entire game. During the quarter’s final three minutes, the Trojans let a three pointer slip in their two-three zone defense, and ASU moved quickly to score and cut the lead down to single digits. 
The Trojans beat through ASU’s press defense as they entered the bonus. Rogers knocked down two free throws at the 2:10 mark to score her 25th and 26th points of the night. ASU had two attempts from the three-point line, but junior guard Taya Hanson missed and saved USC from a neck-and-neck finish. Rogers tied her career-high scoring performance by amassing almost half of her team’s points to overpower the Sun Devils in the final minutes. 
With only a handful of Pac-12 games left and the tournament nearing, Trakh and his squad need to build on Sunday’s performance with consistent wins if they hope to make a successful postseason run.  USC’s next game is against Washington on Feb. 5. Tip off is at 7 p.m.

Topics of safe work environments, women filmmakers and diversity initiatives in the entertainment industry were examined during the conversation between the School of Dramatic Arts and TIME’S UP Thursday.
Entertainment Industry Director Ngoc Nguyen and TIME’S UP Senior Program Manager Michelle Jones Simms offered wisdom and advice to students covering everything from confidence to being a male ally. 
TIME’S UP is a movement that was founded in Jan. 2018 by over 300 women in the entertainment industry. Pursuant to combatting sexual harassment, TIME’S UP works to create fair, secure and dignified work environments for women of all kinds. 
Ngyuen and Jones Simms were introduced by Megan Colligan, current member of the TIME’S UP entertainment board and the School of Dramatic Arts Board of Councilors, who has been working in the entertainment industry for over 25 years. Colligan stated that her work on TIME’s UP has been some of the most rewarding she’s ever done.
“I’ve spent over 25 years in the entertainment industry and watching the organic development of [TIME’S UP],” Colligan said. “And watching the things that I sort of fundamentally believed in manifest themselves and watch rooms full of women share experiences [and] put names to behavior that they no longer were willing to tolerate.”
Nguyen discussed the 4% challenge, which is an initiative that advocates for women directors. Through a study conducted by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative in 2017, the foundation learned that only 4% percent of the directors of the decade’s thousand highest-grossing films were women. Nguyen notes the importance of this initiative in increasing representation of women in leadership roles. 
To continue building more support for women in the industry, Nyugen also discussed a public service announcement launched last year, with support from Google and YouTube, that highlights below the line roles and other viable careers available to women. 
TIME’S UP conducted a study with Dr. Stacy Smith that highlighted the need for women, specifically women of color, in leadership roles.
“One of the key findings of the study was if you had a woman, and particularly a woman of color on the programming staff, it elevated the number of underrepresented films across the board for filmmakers,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen and Jones Simms said this was critical in creating space at the table for women of color in the industry. 
Additionally, Jones Simms examined a two-year pilot program called “Who’s In The Room.” The program includes many components from mentorship, production, budgeting, training to even money management. It was inspired by the questions of who’s in the room and who’s able to get a seat at the table. Within eight to nine months of the program’s start, they had 91% of the individuals in the program get a new job. 
“We decided that we wanted to create pathways to leadership for our next generation of individuals who are in that executive and producer pipeline, so that they can be creating stories and content that will look like the basis that we see here today but also most importantly that will shape the stories of people around us in our communities,” Jones Simms said. 
The conversation eventually shifted to the impact of coronavirus on work environments. Jones Simms discussed how companies are now addressing many of the issues — such as caregiving needs and the impact of household dynamics on one’s work — now that we are working from home. 
“For us, the TIME’S UP overall mission is safe, fair and dignified work,” Nguyen said. “Our three primary [goals] with safety, insisting that everyone’s safe at work; equity, which leveling the playing field for women; then power, which is disrupting the status quo.” 
Nyugen continued the conversation by advising the audience to be intentional and nurturing with your relationships. She emphasized the importance of creating an ecosystem of people you can trust, along with finding a mentor. 
“[Be]really intentional about who you’re bringing in, [be] intentional about having different voices, different perspectives, different lived experiences because that will only make your creative outlet that much more interesting,” Nguyen said.
The discussion concluded with a Q&A where students asked a variety of questions that touched on topics such as acting and production advice and gaining a seat at the table. 
At the end of the webinar, each audience member received a copy of TIME’s UP Foundation resources for USC School of Dramatic Arts students, including their Guide to Working in Entertainment and data from their Inclusion Initiative.

Gabriel Kahn, professor of professional practice of journalism at Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has spent the last few years trying to help the people of Los Angeles better understand their lived experiences.
Kahn is part of a project, “Crosstown,” using data to deliver hyper-local journalism in hopes of building better communities. In a few short years, this collaboration between the Annenberg school and the Integrated Media Systems Center at Viterbi School of Engineering, has built Crosstown into a platform that serves 110 unique L.A. communities. Now, Crosstown plans to expand this service to other cities in partnership with the Local Media Association and Facebook Journalism Project.
Crosstown has a uniquely scalable system. In L.A they’ve “created 110 different, unique editorial products but [they] haven’t created a system that has 110 times the costs involved for producing that,” Kahn said.
This model drives a low user acquisition cost, financially similar to what Facebook or Google might experience. The cost-reducing potential of Crosstown targets local journalism, an industry that has been plagued by “aggressive cost cutting” according to the Brookings Institute.  
Crosstown will be rolling out pilot programs in three U.S. cities: Baton Rouge, La.; New Orleans, La.; and Raleigh, N.C. These pilot programs will bring the same data technology they’ve been using in L.A. for the last few years and will assess to see if this platform helps these cities to better provide for their coverage areas, and at a lower cost.
“In a sense, the scale is not a function of number of users but [of the] number of areas we cover … and that’s exactly [where] the Facebook funding [comes in],” said Cyrus Shahabi, Director of Viterbi’s Integrated Media Systems Center.
The Facebook Journalism Project, a project working to better strengthen the relationships between journalists and the communities they cover, will aid in the expansion of Crosstown, particularly supplying specialized data journalists to specific outlets located within the pilot cities.
And when it comes to the data systems Crosstown is using to power their product, they are not exactly new. In fact, the early bones of what Crosstown is today has been around at USC for a decade.
In 2011, IMSC won a contract, in partnership with USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, to develop a pipeline to better understand L.A. Metro’s traffic data. Originally used to make policy decisions, this traffic data became the first piece of data Crosstown displayed.
Shahabi and IMSC used the Metro data pipeline as the base and built new, generic searchable dashboards where journalists can easily locate information and discover trends. Soon after, they aggregated data and built dashboards for pollution, crime and coronavirus rates.
These dashboards allowed Kahn and other Crosstown journalists to not only discover city wide trends, but to see exact changes in respective neighborhoods, which may potentially differ from the larger picture. As an example, Kahn pointed out that while the City of L.A. takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in parking tickets, a neighborhood like Porter Ranch, 30 miles north of campus, only received four tickets.
Crosstown’s most recent development in the product became the deliverable — a newsletter. 
Crosstown’s newsletter is written “mad-lib’’ style. Journalists construct the story and simple code developed by IMSC pulls the exact stats for each neighborhood, making a unique newsletter for every single data-supported area. 
“You let the journalist really do what they’re good at, that is to create the news part of the story, and you give them the means to access the data just by writing some piece of text that references the data on the draft of the newsletter that then gets specialized to all the locations,” said Luciano Nocera, associate director of IMSC.
The team behind crosstown hopes their method of reporting becomes a model for other news outlets, using data to empower journalists and their upcoming pilot programs will be a major test.
“If we can figure out a way, particularly in places where coverage has disappeared, to produce coverage, cheaply, some type of coverage, have we watered areas that previously became news desserts?” Kahn said.

During the 2020 presidential election, Jillian Kravitz noticed the nation’s political polarization and a toxic environment created from a lack of understanding for others’ beliefs. This led to her, along with co-founder and vice president Alethea Freidberg, establishing The Moderator: a new campus organization for students to have an outlet for their opinions.
“Since when has a presidential election for one person made us completely cut off friends, completely cut off connections, completely divided us [to] such an extreme,?” said Kravitz, a sophomore majoring in global health. 
The organization was named “The Moderator” because each discussion is moderated by a member, using a three-tier system for meetings. The first tier is to discuss “icebreaker” topics, such as if one should take hot showers or cold showers, or if one prefers cats or dogs. The second tier are community-based discussion questions, such as “Would raising tuition be good for students?” The third tier involves publicly-deemed controversial topics, such as issues like affirmative action or defunding the police. 
Created early-November, the founders said their primary objective is to provide a space for meaningful and productive discussions so students can understand various perspectives. 
“I know we don’t like talking to people we disagree with, but nevertheless, it’s important to remember that there’s a rationale from all different perspectives and all opinions,” Kravitz said. 
Lexi Lee, one of the first members in the club, emphasized that all points of view and beliefs are respected, even if it leads to uncomfortable conversations. However, Kravitz said that they teach students to “read, reflect, and inspect,” so members can be more aware of their words. 
“We’re also trying to make sure that we avoid topics that would allow for harmful rhetoric … So that way, we make sure that wording isn’t loaded, to make sure that [the E-board is] controlling the conversation, but also allowing for it to be productive,” Kravitz said. 
The club’s meetings and discussions are monitored and led by the E-board who, although seen as leaders of the organization, are not meant to be seen in elevated positions from other students during discussions, Kravitz said. The club is a constantly evolving entity that allows anyone to make suggestions for changes, she said. 
Rather than debating about certain topics, The Moderator focuses on providing awareness on having different opinions. 
“The main goal … is to be comfortable with discomfort, the discomfort of disagreeing with people, the discomfort of not having everybody believing the same things you do,” Kravitz said. “The discomfort that our society is at a crossroads,” Kravitz said. “And we can’t just keep sitting in the same echo chambers we have been just because we feel safer in our opinions.”
Freidberg said that in a nation where “everyone politically stays in their own bubble,” having a club that shows many different points of view is essential.
Lee said “there’s something for everyone,” as not all discussions are always political. One of the topics discussed at an unofficial “test run” meeting, she said, was on toilet paper orientation — whether toilet paper should be placed upwards or downwards on the roll. 
“Obviously, that’s not a super controversial topic … but it was cool to see how I can just come to an understanding from such a simplistic topic,” said Lee, a sophomore majoring in communication. 
Seeing how other people viewed putting toilet paper downwards made her realize there is always a different perspective, even with topics that “affect our everyday lives in such nuanced ways.”
The first official meeting, held Jan. 27, contained civil discussion about about whether hotdogs could be considered sandwiches, whether canceling spring break was justified and whether a nation-wide lockdown would be beneficial at that point in time, Freidberg said.
For each topic discussed, the 15 participants would change their Zoom name to their stance on the issue, then elaborate in conversation. Kravitz said participants were engaged, asking each other questions to further each discussion.
“I’m so glad it went so well … Everyone that has been involved in the founding of this club has been working so hard,” Freidberg said. “It was just a simple idea back in November and to see it finally become a reality, … it feels nice that it pays off.” 
Kravitz said the club will  “slowly, but surely, better encompass what makes up the University of Southern California,” as new members join and bring in their own perspectives on difficult issues and confront societal controversies.
In the future, Kravitz and Freidberg hope to bring in guest speakers, panelists and anybody with a unique perspective or background. They also hope to participate in fundraisers, town halls and collaborate with other student organizations on campus, they said.
Freidberg also said she sees the club becoming a national organization, reaching other campuses and possibly holding national meetings every semester. 
“When this becomes a multinational, multi-campus thing, we definitely want to have events once a semester with students from other schools to have our own little meetings, because I feel like discussion with college-aged students from other schools will be so interesting to have. That would also prepare us for a larger scale national event,” Freidberg said.
After the coronavirus pandemic subsides and the club can meet in-person, Kravitz plans on creating pop-up booths across campus that allow students to give their opinions on certain topics provided by the booth so that any USC student can participate in open discussions. She also predicts that meetings will be similar to Socratic seminars with desks arranged in a circle. 
The Moderator’s Zoom meetings are held on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. Those interested in joining can reach out to themoderatorusc on instagram or email themoderatorusc@gmail.com. 
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Alethea Freidberg’s name as “Friedberg.” The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Twenty-year-old British singer-songwriter Arlo Parks wears her heart on her sleeve, and it’s apparent when you read the biographical section of her Spotify profile. It explains her as having “spent most of school feeling like that Black kid who couldn’t dance for shit, listening to too much emo music and crushing on some girl in her Spanish class.”
This statement acts as a kind of ethos for her debut studio album, “Collapsed in Sunbeams,” released Jan. 29 by Transgressive Records.
Drawing upon indie folk and lo-fi bedroom pop styles with a splash of jazz and soul influences, Parks’ gentle voice intertwines with subtle yet gorgeous instrumentals across 12 tracks on the album. 
Discussing the album with NME in an article published Oct. 20, Parks described it as “a series of vignettes and intimate portraits surrounding [her] adolescence and the people that shaped it. It is rooted in storytelling and nostalgia – I want it to feel both universal and hyper-specific.” 
Parks’ artistic merits and versatility are bared from the start of the album, as she kicks things off with the titular spoken-word piece “Collapsed in Sunbeams” where she croons “I see myself ablazed with joy, sleepy eyed / Feeding your cat or slicing artichoke hearts.” Parks’ talent for discerning her range of emotions while also recounting incredibly intimate and silly moments adds incredible depth to an album that largely sees a young woman grasping weighty themes of mental health and sexuality. 
Parks’ collaborators are instrumental in telling her story and architecting the gorgeous, understated soundscapes of the album; Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Luca Buccellati has his hands in every song here as a co-writer and producer, and famed bedroom pop act Clairo is a co-writer, guitarist and background vocalist on album standout “Green Eyes.” Acclaimed as a single, this cut sees Parks assuring her partner to live authentically and unapologetically and that the homophobic noise bombarding them will not last forever (“Some of these folks wanna make you cry (Oh, oh) / But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide”). 
Parks’ commentary feels less like preaching and more like the comfort of a close friend assuring you that they are right beside you through thick and thin.
This constant quality throughout Parks’ songs shows up on the fantastic “Black Dog,” which NME previously named the fourth best song of 2020 as well as its “most devastating song.” Winston Churchill’s metaphor of choice for depression, “Black Dog” was quietly released in May of last year when lockdowns due to the pandemic became widespread.
Describing the single, Parks said “it’s supposed to make people who are struggling feel less isolated and start a conversation surrounding the prevalence of mental health issues in today’s world.” 
Writing in the perspective of a friend to someone struggling with depression, Parks pleads “Let’s go to the corner store and buy some fruit / I would do anything to get you out your room / Just take your medicine and eat some food / I would do anything to get you out your room” over melancholic acoustic guitar and steady drums.
Similarly to other cuts on the album such as “Hope” and “For Violet,” Parks finds incredible power in her soft, hushed vocal delivery, illustrating her vivid stories with painstaking heartache. 
Parks continues to show off her flair for the poetic on several spots on the album, including “Caroline,” where she chronicles witnessing two lovers fight in public: “I was waiting for the bus one day / Watched a fight between an artsy couple escalate / Strawberry cheeks flushed with defeated rage / Then he spilled his coffee as he frantically explained.” 
However, Parks consistently manages to draw focus back to her personal narrative and experiences, like on “Eugene” where she yearns for an unavailable straight girl and attempts to untangle her web of feelings. The language with which Parks describes herself, those around her, and her environment shines through in every lyric she writes and performs here.
Almost Taylor Swift-esque in her ability to magnify seemingly insignificant or trivial moments to maximum proportions, Parks successfully synthesizes the best of her influences (including Frank Ocean and Solange) in order to craft an album that is able to perfectly simulate the earth-shattering turbulence of adolescence and all of its messy implications. Parks is most certainly a musician to keep an eye out for and here’s to hoping her future work is just as beautiful as this.

After winning the BRIT Award for “Rising Star” and the BBC Music Award for “Introducing Artist of the Year,” Los Angeles born, British Jamaican singer Celeste has finally released her highly anticipated debut album “Not Your Muse.” 
Evocative, technical and timeless, “Not Your Muse” reveals the soulful singer’s potential to secure her place in the music world as a generational talent and superstar. Her jazz-steeped voice acts as a stand alone, uncompromising — showcasing her artistry without the need for heavy background beats and intense instrumentals to enhance the quality of her vocals. 
With a whispering touch to her deep, mellifluous voice, the album begins with “Ideal Woman.” A perfect introduction to the artist’s work with a simple guitar instrumental backing her celestial voice, she sings “I may not be your ideal woman / The heaven in your head / The one that’s gonna save you / From all your discontent.” 
“Ideal Woman” is about refusing to meet the stereotypes and expectations that society’s gaze has set forth on women. The song is about embracing and loving yourself as you are, unchanged by those who want to tell you how you should act and what you should be.  
Delivering an intimate performance of “Strange” at the BRIT awards in 2020, Celeste’s chilling voice is backed only by a soft piano gently meeting her lingering, bold vocals with grace throughout the song — each chord as it strikes feels like the light pulse of a heart beat. 
Closing your eyes while listening will send you into corners of smoky jazz bars, empty sidewalks, tucked away coffee shops and places where moments quickly become memories. This song impeccably describes the nature of friendships, relationships and nostalgia for someone that once was in your life but is no longer. 
With stunning vocal resonance, Celeste sings “Isn’t it strange? How people can change / From strangers to friends / Friends into lovers / And strangers again.”
Switching up the pace from the previous ballad, “Tonight Tonight” features a snappy drum beat, a jazzy melody and Celeste’s sonorous timbre. Though there isn’t a lot of dynamic vocal changes and dramatic verse-to-chorus transitions, the song overall feels steady, fast-moving and repetitious from the drums to the strings. 
Bringing the heat to the tracklist, “Stop This flame” is the perfect departure from the previous song as it’s one of the more magnetic and upbeat tunes off the album. Though released in early 2020, this melody is still just as golden as it was when we first heard it. 
Celeste sings “My heart goes up, my heart goes down / We fall in love and we fall back out.”
Featured on the FIFA 21 video game soundtrack, “Stop This flame” is one of the songs that created buzz around Celeste’s name. From the vocals to the chorus to the jazzy instrumental, it’s clear her early inspirations and influences such as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Diana Ross have impacted her lyrical style and vocal performance in this album. 
Slowing the pace back down, “Tell Me Something I Don’t Know” is bold yet subtle and soothing. It’s also the first on the album to have a backup vocalist singing alongside Celeste in the latter half of the chorus, harmonizing beautifully. Igniting a fiery passion within her, the chorus bursts with energy and keeps a similar mood to the songs that came before. 
Simple, light and mellow, the title track “Not Your Muse” feels like a Sunday evening kind of song. When the song opens, there’s a soft sound of an acoustic guitar strumming and a slow whistle behind it. Then, an electric guitar chimes in, holding out some of the higher notes, giving the background sound a calming, lingering effect. Rather than bringing the chorus to a crescendo, the song has a beautiful delicacy to it, much like others on the album. 
“Not Your Muse” seems to transition flawlessly to the next song, “Beloved.” The beginning vibraphone ringing is so captivating and a sound you don’t often hear in pop music today. As the song winds down, it feels as though it would play in the end credits to a fairytale. However, there’s not much of a tone shift from many of the other ballads. 
How it ends is beautiful, with sonorous high notes that feel as though they wrap your mind and soul. Celeste sings with that same whispering, echoing tone to her voice she started the album with: “Dearly beloved, if I had my way / You’d be here to stay.”
Reminiscent of the brassy sound comparable to Amy Winehouse’s album “Back to Black,” Celeste’s “Love is Back” was released last New Year’s Eve. About finally finding a partner who sees the best in you and convinces you that there’s still hope for love, the song has a euphoric sensibility.
Another slow burner, “Some Goodbyes Come With Hellos” brings a mesmerizing, peaceful serenity to the tracks that come before. Charmingly written with a beautiful message, Celeste sings “Sometimes we can’t choose things we are drawn to / Ones we are bound to lose / No one ever knows where it’s gonna go / But some goodbyes come with hellos.”
“Lately” sounds tonally similar to most of the tracks on the album. The melody is slow, then picks up a bit for the chorus, and comes back to a dark, heavier-toned expression. It doesn’t bring anything unique or fresh to the other sounds and moods already heard previously. 
Though Celeste has an extraordinarily unique, soulful voice and timeless talent and “Not Your Muse” successfully showcases the singer’s vocals, it still feels like there’s some unfulfilled potential that the 26-year-old has yet to tap into. 
The full one hour and 18 minutes of the album were captivating and fresh in some moments but fell short of vocal range, mood and tone shifts in others. As a new artist, Celeste still has so much growth and potential to showcase her talent in new ways for years to come. “Not your Muse” is just the beginning.

There is something I must get out of the way before I begin this column — ‘Politics and Prose’ is not an original name. It is the name of a bookstore in Washington D.C. I have not been there, but I would very much like to go. By all accounts, it appears to be an incredible bookstore, and I am indebted to them for possessing the necessary genius to create such a brilliant name, but I digress. 
I am writing this column because it often seems as if our national political discourse is increasingly void of nuance.
The 2020 election, and many of the events that preceded it, demonstrated the increasing desire of more and more Americans to engage with politics. By and large, this is an incredible thing, but it is not without its cons. Many students are already aware of the prevalence of virtue-signaling and performative wokeness, but I believe the issue here goes beyond that. I can only speak from my own personal experience, but it appears that in some circles, critical thinking has been replaced by infographics and thoughtful contemplation has been replaced by a devotion to buzzwords and slogans. 
Infographics, buzzwords and slogans are not inherently bad. In fact, they often distill and distribute messages and ideals that can enlighten those who come across them. I want to make this clear: I generally like these three things. However, it should not be controversial to simply suggest that our seemingly increasing reliance on them to understand our shared political reality is concerning. 
So that is why I decided to write about books. There is something that happens to you after spending a couple of days or weeks with a book that just can’t be mimicked by other mediums. Books also offer their writers a chance to explain themselves and argue their point without being confined to the limits of social media. Infographics and buzzwords might be effective communicators, but they simply cannot capture the necessary complexity that a book offers.
In that same vein, I’ll begin this column with Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land.”
Released Nov. 20, the memoir tells the story of Obama, in his own words, from some of his earliest childhood memories to his first two and a half years as president of the United States. The book has been received remarkably well since its release, and rightfully so; Obama’s prose is beautiful and his details are captivating. The former president is also strikingly introspective in his memoir, often inviting the reader to evaluate his ambition and his intentions, his shortcomings and his triumphs. 
The memoir has also been praised for its ability to mean many things to many people. For some, it might serve as a commentary on U.S. race relations. Obama doesn’t shy away from discussing the topic of his racial otherness or some Americans’ aversion to it. For others, “A Promised Land” might read as an insightful look into the inner workings of the executive branch. Many might read it simply for its gossipy bits — who knew the President’s trips to his own bathroom were monitored by the Secret Service and referred to as trips to the “secondary hold?”
“A Promised Land” is all of those things and much more, but for me, it read primarily as an exposition on what it means to be American and what America is. The portrait Obama paints of the country, its public servants and its citizens is an inspiring one — one that evinces a patriotism rooted in compassion and tolerance. 
This prevailing ethos is best expressed during Obama’s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, a speech that Obama presents as one of the most significant, catalyzing events that catapulted him to national prominence. 
“[…] There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America — there’s the United States of America,’ Obama said. “There’s not a Black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.”
This same patriotic current ebbs and flows through much of the book and does appear to sincerely inform much of Obama’ worldview. Still, for all of the pride in America the speech elicits, it also foists upon the reader a troubling question: Was the “magical” country Obama described really just a fantasy?
Any American with a modest understanding of our national state of affairs is surely able to see that America is anything but united — what with insurrectionists successfully invading the U.S. Capitol on the orders of former President Donald Trump, feckless Senators challenging the results of an election despite droves of evidence to the contrary and a sizable proportion of Americans willfully refusing to respect public health guidelines despite a death toll of nearly half a million Americans. 
However, Obama’s memoir is not blind to this sorry, foul state of affairs. In fact, his memoir presages much of the political violence Americans see today. Obama recalls a white woman “grimly unwilling” to shake his hand and people sporting confederate flags outside of his campaign events, telling him to “go home.” He recalls the “nativist bile” that Sarah Palin spewed to her audiences, who in turn would shout “terrorist,” “kill him” and “off with his head” in reference to Obama. 
Obama writes much, much more about the political rot he sees spreading across the country. Though he spends ample time extolling the decency of many Americans, ordinary citizens and public servants alike, and the hard, often heroic work of government officials on both sides of the aisle, one still cannot help but notice in his memoir a creeping, malevolent force gaining traction in America, like a spreading cancer one encounters every fiftieth page or so. 
In light of this, it is clear that the America Obama described in 2004, the same America he describes throughout “A Promised Land,” is still, as the title suggests, a promise — a promise yet to be fulfilled, but still a promise worth fighting for.

Much is true in the famous proverb, “BLACKPINK in your area.” With over-the-top production, bedazzled wardrobes and intricate choreography, “The Show” brought BLACKPINK to everyone’s area Saturday night and proved that they’re one of the fiercest groups to look out for. 
Since their debut in 2016 with YG Entertainment, BLACKPINK has captivated audiences everywhere, becoming a household name worldwide. Much is also true in their other famous proverb, “BLACKPINK is the revolution,” as they’ve dominated the music industry, consistently breaking records and even taking over Netflix with their documentary “BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky.” These takeovers have culminated into the group holding their own international stage, “The Show,” a virtual concert in partnership with Youtube Music.
After one postponement of the highly anticipated concert due to coronavirus protocols in South Korea, BLACKPINK members Lisa, Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé came strutting through the virtual stage as if to say they’re ready to take on 2021. Rocking intricate choreography in glittery gowns, they began “The Show” with their record-breaking hit, “Kill This Love,” followed by first performances of songs off their debut album, “The Album.” 
The set allowed BLINKs to get a feel for each member’s talents through solo performances beginning with Jisoo, the oldest of the group, who took us back with her eased-down cover of Tove Lo’s 2014 hit, “Habits (Stay High).” 
Lisa, the group’s main rapper, followed Jisoo with a snazzy cover of Doja Cat’s “Say So,” proving her versatility as a singer and a rapper with her own twist including her own verse and a dance break. “Liyoncé,” as her bandmates called her, did exactly what she had to do!
BLACKPINK’s global domination doesn’t stop within their own music. Mother Monster herself, Lady Gaga, featured the K-pop group on “Sour Candy,” a house track off of “Chromatica.” The group reunited after the two solo performances to vogue in bubblegum pink costumes singing, “I’m sour candy. So sweet, then I get a little angry,” with moves so sharp they could be felt through the screen.
Jennie, BLACKPINK’s rapper and vocalist, released her solo single “SOLO’’ in 2018 but proved it to be timeless when she performed it at the show three years later. Looking flawless in a red rose-shaped gown, Jennie raps, “W no L’s. Covered W and ELLE and there’s none left on the shelf,” flaunting her magazine covers in a brand new verse on the song.
One of the most anticipated performances of the night was from Rosé, the group’s lead vocalist, whose solo project was expected to debut on “The Show.” As an interlude, the stream premiered the first half of the music video for “Gone,” Rosé’s vulnerable breakup ballad and transitioned into her performing the song next to an empty swing set. While BLACKPINK as a collective is capable of hitting us with that “DDU-DU DDU-DU,” they also have the ability to provide us with more raw, non-dance tracks such as Rosé’s “Gone.”
A few minutes of vulnerability is enough for BLACKPINK however. “Gone” transitioned into each of the members in a red room showing their alluring side. They reunite on stage performing “Pretty Savage,” which they gave BLINKs a sneak peek of on The Late Late Show with James Corden. Much like the name BLACKPINK, the song intermingles Rosé and Jisoo’s vocals with Lisa and Jennie’s raps showing that they have two versatile sides to the group; they’re pretty and savage. 
It also wouldn’t be a BLACKPINK concert if they didn’t hit us with that “DDU-DU DDU-DU.” Becoming the most-viewed music video from K-Pop group, “DDU-DU DDU-DU” was a milestone in their global domination and remains a signature in their discography. The song was one of the most exhilarating performances of the night with a stage lit by fire and an energized dance break in a shallow pool of water. With an extra umph, the concert showed exactly why the song became an earworm for fans.
One thing’s for sure, the group dedicates much of their effort to their passionate BLINKs worldwide. An interlude shows them reminiscing in their first sold out venue (now empty) thinking about their dreams and aspirations when they were part of the trainee system, a rigorous years-long process required to become a K-pop idol. Throughout the show, they emphasize the importance of their fans. “Watching our concert, I hope you get the feeling that we’re all together,” Rosé said. 
Riding the wave of nostalgia, they performed many of their older songs including their bold, debut hip-hop track from 2016, “Whistle.” A medley of jumpy and energetic songs in sparkly white outfits was enough to bring the fans back to simpler times, delivering their promise of giving BLINKs a one-of-a-kind BLACKPINK experience.
Hyping each other up and thanking the band for adding a one-of-a-kind umph to their music, the girls ended the show dedicating their last song, “Forever Young,” to their BLINKs on a stage decorated with emotional letters from their fans worldwide. BLACKPINK not only showed love to each other but gave the fans a heartwarming moment of unity.
The simplicity of its name, “The Show,” much like the name of their debut album, “The Album,” is meant to drive attention toward the girls’ wow-factor and create ambiguity after high anticipation for their projects (fans didn’t receive an album till four years after their debut). While fans may not have known what to expect, BLACKPINK expects fans to trust their delivery. 
The members delivered more than just a show; they delivered “The Show.” They carried a unique BLACKPINK experience forming a connection not only as a collective group but through their individual solo abilities. A show shined by glittery outfits, fire and voguing brought an omnipresent BLACKPINK to your area, my area and everyone’s area and made fans feel closer than ever to Lisa, Jennie, Rosé and Jisoo.

This is exactly how people’s heads end up in guillotines. 
At a time of civil unrest, economic disparity and plain old-fashioned grief, the most foolish thing those in power can do is peacock their most overtly greedy and exploitative practices at the capitalism parade.
Yet that is exactly what they did when, for some reason, Robinhood Markets Inc., Webull Financial LLC, E*Trade Financial Corp. and Interactive Brokers Group Inc., all stock trading platforms, restricted the purchase of Gamestop, AMC Entertainment and Nokia stocks among others.
For quick context, earlier last month a group of retail investors, coordinating through a Reddit thread called r/WallStreetBets, decided to organize a short squeeze on stocks that had been heavily shorted by large scale hedge funds. 
A short squeeze is when investors intentionally drive the price of a stock up in order to force short sellers into paying back the shares they shorted at a much higher price than they bought them at.
Bear in mind that the goal of a short seller is to “borrow” a stock at a certain price, sell it to someone else at that price and only pay back the stock once the share price has gone down (which they’re effectively betting on). If short sellers are forced to pay their positions back at higher prices than anticipated, then the stocks they shorted soar in value from this influx of buyers at such a high price and all those who remain traditionally invested in the stock benefit. 
This move on the part of Robinhood alone, and whoever else their CEO is in cahoots with, restricted their 13 million users from buying any of the stocks involved in the short squeeze. It doesn’t take a mathematician to remark that restricting 13 million investors from buying a particularly hot stock for any interval of time might cost the stock and their investors a decent amount of money — which is exactly what happened.
When hedge funds and big corporations wage these kinds of betting wars among themselves, no one, online brokerages or otherwise, gets in their way or restricts any stocks. The only discernible difference in this case is that it is only the big hedge funds losing money on their shorting positions, and it is mostly everyday retail investors making the big gains. 
There is a somewhat unified sentiment that the trading platforms’ move to limit the trading of these stocks was a bootlicking attempt at appeasing their large hedge fund clients by helping them minimize losses. Members of Congress have mentioned the possibility of a hearing concerning the stock trading platforms and hedge funds involved. The situation is still unfolding and whether or not there will be actual repercussions remains to be discovered, but make no mistake, this only happened because the short squeeze hurt the pockets of very rich corporations. If this was a statement against market manipulation then most of these hedge funds would be out of business by now. 
Many have expressed public outrage by this particular show of seemingly unchecked corporate power, from Donald Trump Jr. to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Elon Musk to some of the memesters included in the 6.3 million users subscribed to r/WallStreetBets. And these groups of people don’t agree often. 
While we bicker and fight over $20 bills and the significance of the U.S. treasury secretary’s gender, the fact is that we mostly agree on the deeply problematic nature of corporate power in the United States. So, in the interest of fixing an issue that we all agree on and that currently has our undivided attention, let’s hanker down on one specific mechanism by which corporations gain political power in the United States and list a few things you can do about it. 
Generally speaking, lobbying is the practice of attempting to influence legislators on legislation. It has evolved into an industry that spent roughly $3.5 billion dollars on their legislation-affecting activities in 2020 alone. 
The way this plays out in real time is special interest groups, like, say, hedge fund lobbyists, hold fundraising events for legislators and donate bundles of money to them on the tacit agreement that this money is being exchanged for the favorable legislative treatment of their industry. 
Another way this plays out is through direct and roundabout campaign funding from lobbyists to federal parties, candidates and “outside groups,” for upcoming elections. These are effectively another technicality by which political donors can circumvent political donation limits, which are later exchanged for, you guessed it, political favors honoring the highest contributors. In the case of hedge fund lobbying, the industry contributed roughly $200 million to political campaign funding in 2020.
A final way lobbying plays out is through something called “the revolving door.” Legislators, who are not known for their extravagant income, get offered positions at lobbying firms with six figure salaries on the yet-again-tacit condition that these politicians will bear their future employers in mind when crafting legislation. Eighty-six percent of hedge fund lobbyists were once legislators. 
If this doesn’t smell fishy enough yet, a hedge fund called Citadel LLC. that had alleged (and disputed) involvement in Robinhood’s decision to limit the buying of GME, AMC, etc. was also the top contributor to hedge-fund lobbyists in the 2020 election cycle, having contributed roughly $48 million by themselves. 
There is simply no comparable incentive for politicians to hold these hedge funds (or any corporations really) accountable for screwing the little guys when these firms are financing their entire legislative careers. Suggesting a congressional hearing to remedy the hedge fund situation is a hilarious joke once you realize that those hearings are pretty much paid for by the hedge funds themselves. 
In order to see the right people get held accountable for this whole Robinhood fiasco or anything similar, as so many claim to want, then it is necessary to start caring about limiting corporate lobbying. The revolving door needs to close, lobbyist fundraising loopholes need to get plugged and all the same people who were so enraged about this entire ordeal on Twitter need to start monitoring who is bought by who (opensecrets.org is a great resource to start).  
Let’s get awareness of corporate lobbying to the moon!

Entering USC, students get bombarded with pamphlets on various academic programs. They see the glamor of the Marshall School of Business, resources allocated to the Viterbi School of Engineering programs and the spotlight on the School of Cinematic Arts. USC is unique in that there seems to be a specialized school for almost every single academic discipline — journalism, business, dance and music. With so many specialized schools, students give little attention to USC’s liberal arts college, the Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences. 
All disciplines that don’t have their own school are in Dornsife. Everything from philosophy and math to biology and political science falls under this umbrella. In addition to these academic disciplines, Dornsife is also home to all the students who come into USC as undecided. 
Despite the college’s wide-encompassing presence, some students think little of the school. As early as the application process, students see Dornsife as a backup. When high school applicants are rejected from more selective schools such as Marshall, they are automatically considered for Dornsife. Even the internal application process seems to validate the college’s lack of importance. 
Transferring to Viterbi requires a B in three major classes, making the transfer process take up to an entire school year. With an acceptance rate in the single digits, transferring into SCA is even harder, requiring three letters of recommendation and countless supplements. In contrast, transferring into Dornsife only requires a half-hour appointment with an academic advisor. Anyone, no matter their current classes or grade level, can add a Dornsife major. 
Along with its lack of selectivity, Dornsife also has less resources and access to exclusive programs. Marshall is famous for their career advising services, allowing any business major to make unlimited appointments. They also receive complimentary subscriptions to various career resources. Marshall is home to prestigious programs including the Global Leadership Program, which allows the top of the freshman class to travel to China to meet business executives. 
SCA boasts USC’s distinguished film and television major. With private film showings and famous professors, USC’s small cinematic arts school is well cared for. 
In comparison, very little is exclusive to Dornsife. The vast majority of Dornsife resources are also available to students in other schools. 
With its lack of selectivity and resources, it’s easy to see the liberal arts college as a place for the leftovers and the untalented. After all, if anyone were truly smart they could get A’s in computer science courses to transfer into Viterbi instead of declaring its less prestigious counterpart in Dornsife, Physics/CS. Why would anyone want to be an economics major if they could be in a top business school like Marshall?
These statements ultimately make an incorrect assumption on the reason students choose their academic discipline.While the liberal arts college may have its share of unmotivated students and Marshall rejects, these students exist in every school at USC and are not the result of Dornsife’s lack of rigor. The vast majority of students choose Dornsife because the school contains the subject they are interested in. 
Dornsife doesn’t need a crazy low acceptance rate or a fancy career center to be a great learning community; its apparent weaknesses — such as its lack of selectivity and resources — are what make the school what it is: an accessible and nurturing environment that welcomes all who are willing and wanting to learn.  
The college has unparalleled professors teaching small classes on important social issues, open to anyone to take. As USC’s least pre-professional college, Dornsife has courses in the humanities and social sciences that not only teach students the critical thinking skills they need for their future career, but also make students more knowledgeable about the world around them. After all, college is about finding who you are and who you want to be; with its interdisciplinary courses and welcoming environment, Dornsife is the best place to do just that. 
Less wealthy than Viterbi, less glittery than Marshall, Dornsife exhibits the very best qualities of USC — inclusivity, interdisciplinary thought and community. All students should want to participate in such a diverse and dynamic community, and with Dornsife’s lack of entrance requirements, everyone can. The door’s always open to Dornsife; come on in.
