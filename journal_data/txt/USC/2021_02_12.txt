The No. 20 USC Trojans average height across the roster stands at a towering 6-feet-7-inches, good for the tallest in the entire NCAA. With the likes of star freshman forward Evan Mobley and his brother sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley contesting shots at the rim, it was no surprise that Washington managed just 22 points in the paint in a 69-54 beatdown at the hands of the TrojansThursday night. 
USC’s staggering length and quickness were on full display in a showdown which featured two teams with completely different styles of play. The Trojans reverted to old school ’80s and ’‘90s-style basketball, dominating on the glass and pounding the ball inside. At the end of the first half, USC had more offensive rebounds (10) than Washington had total rebounds (nine). 
Between the Mobley brothers and redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin, the Trojans continued to get into favorable positions down low, putting up 46 points in the paint with a flurry of bank shots, floaters and thunderous slams. In true, old school basketball fashion, head coach Andy Enfield’s team only attempted seven 3-pointers, connecting on just a single 3-point shot late in the second half. 
“We’re an inside game, offense first; that’s where our big guys are hard to stop,” Enfield said after the win. “Then our guards, when they make shots, we’re awfully good. Tonight, we didn’t have it going from the perimeter, but we made enough plays in the last 15 minutes to win the game.”
By stark contrast, the Huskies launched 22 shots from beyond the arc, nailling five of them. Senior guard Quade Green led the Husky offense in the first half, connecting on seven of his nine field goal attempts for 14 points, keeping Washington afloat when they were in need of an offensive spark. Even Enfield was impressed by Green’s first half display. 
“I thought I was watching Damian Lillard out there for a few minutes, you know how hard he is to stop,” said Enfield. “Damian Lillard is very much like Quade Green, with that speed, that quickness, that shot making.” 
Despite his flattering comparison for Green, Enfield’s revised gameplan after halftime held the explosive guard to just 2 points on six shots in the second half. Enfield’s group dug in defensively, holding the Huskies to just 35% shooting after halftime to keep them at bay until the final whistle.
The Trojans were able to truly gain control of the game with an assertive 18-4 run late to end of the first half, as the offense started clicking. Isaiah, who posted his fifth double-double off the season, continued to corral offensive rebounds, leading to second chance opportunities. With redshirt senior guard Tahj Eady and Evan putting constant pressure on the undersized Huskies at the rim, the Trojans defended the inside well. With the offense came the defense, as the Trojans pulled away and stayed ahead through to the finish, holding their opponent to under 70 points for the sixth straight time. 
“Our starters came back in the game and played like they wanted to take the lead at halftime. They gave us great energy,” Enfield said. “They locked down defensively and then took great shots at the other end. I thought that was a very, very impressive seven minute stretch for our starters.”
The win was USC’s first in Seattle since 2017. Now, they’ll head 300 miles east to face off against Washington State Saturday, as USC will try to tighten its grip on the No.1 spot in the Pac-12 conference. Tip off is at 5 p.m. at the Beasley Coliseum.

A heart-shaped box of Ferrero Rocher, a bouquet of flowers and a romantic night in with your boo is something everyone deserves and few have. On the single end, we dreamers stay wishing for the simple things in life such as a USC Missed Connections post or a Zoom bae. They may not come in time for Valentine’s Day but don’t give up! Continue looking cute, turning on your camera and your cutie will arrive. While we wait for those dreams to come true, why not turn on a playlist that will have your heart fluttering, your booty shaking and your prospective admirers lining up? 
Charli XCX – “claws” 
To get you dreaming of a romantic Valentine’s Day, Charli XCX uses her signature auto-tuned sound to sing the catchy chorus, “I like, I like, I like everything about you,” and document her infatuation for her quarantine boo. 
TWICE – “Feel Special”
The K-pop girl group’s 2019 single, “Feel Special,” brings the bliss and cuteness and only amplifies the daydream of having a special someone to learn the choreography with.
QT – “Hey QT”
The hyperpop, SOPHIE-produced track describes exactly what we’re feeling for our virtual crush. In an interview with Fader, QT said, “it’s about that feeling of sensing someone’s presence even when they are not in the same physical space.”
100 gecs – “ringtone (Remix) [feat. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, Kero Kero Bonito]”
What’s better than 100 gecs? Charli XCX, Rico Nasty and KKB on a song with them! The bubbly power collaboration describes their boyfriends’ ringtones with glitchy dialtones, barking dogs and tons of autotune. 
Nelly Furtado – “Promiscuous feat. Timbaland”
Teasing each other back and forth, Nelly Furtado and Timbaland created a decade-defining moment in this flirtatious 2006 hit. It’d be nice to have someone to duet the song with. In the meantime, we singles have to sing both parts.
Timbaland, Keri Hilson, D.O.E. – “The Way I Are”
Timbaland sings, “I ain’t got no money. I ain’t got no car to take you on a date,” to emphasize that he’s broke, so it’ll just be him, his lover and vibes – the perfect Valentine’s Day trio.
Kylie Minogue – “Can’t Get You Out of My Head”
The Aussie queen of pop was a genius when she created this retro song. It sounds fresh, cute and is possibly one of the catchiest pop songs to ever exist.
Lady Gaga – “Boys Boys Boys”
From her iconic debut album, “The Fame,” music revolutionary Lady Gaga sings about her type of guy and emphasizes just how much she likes “boys” by repeating it a total of 83 times. That is something only a legend can do.
Ariana Grande – “Baby I”
You can’t go wrong with an Ariana Grande classic. This cutesy love song from Grande’s debut album is perfect if you want to fantasize about having a ponytail, the ability to sing a whistle note and a boo of course.
Katy Perry – “Teenage Dream”
The early 2010s were the prime years for Tumblr vibes and, more importantly, Katy Perry, who provided us with a romantic “Teenage Dream” that we all still hope for.
Little Mix – “Touch”
In a time with limited physical touch, this song by the British pop group Little Mix is the closest we can get. The girls come together for the perfect, colorful pop song about a now forbidden action during pandemic times – touch.
Dua Lipa – “Levitating”
Have you ever liked someone so much that you feel like you’re levitating? “Dula Peep,” as Wendy Williams calls her, has you covered with her single describing her intergalactic love with “sugarboo.” 
Nicki Minaj – “Your Love”
Barb or not, her versatility is undeniable. Pink wig-wearer and “Pink Friday” creator Nicki Minaj is able to flawlessly pull off a love song just as well as she’s able to pull off a song called “Stupid Hoe.”
Destiny’s Child – “Cater 2 U”
Have you thought of all the things you want to provide for your boo? No need to. Beyoncé, Kelly and Michelle did all the work for you and crafted a song to make sure you’ll be the best significant other you could possibly be. 
Taylor Swift – “Love Story (Taylor’s Version)”
The playlist would be incomplete without this classic. “Love Story” is already iconic as it is, but when it comes to Taylor Swift, she always knows how to make things better. This 2021 re-recording brings her new style to one of her first hits to ensure our money doesn’t go to Scooter Braun. It’s so thoughtful of her for allowing us a Swiftie-style Valentine’s Day!

Thirty years ago, Director Jonathan Demme’s “Silence of the Lambs” shocked audiences everywhere when it introduced the horror-filled world of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. “Silence” is now well known for its creepily fascinating cannibal, Lecter, and its alluring and tough junior FBI agent, Starling. 
Although the movie focuses on Lecter and the horrifying mind of America’s most infamous psychiatrist, it introduces a traumatic and unexplored backstory for Clarice. Notably, Clarice tearfully tells the story of the nightmare-inducing screams of lamb being slaughtered on her Uncle’s farm that still haunt her years later.  
This interesting part of her backstory is never fully fleshed out in “Silence” and, for decades, studios have ignored Clarice and focused on churning out sequel after sequel on Hannibal the Cannibal. But, for the first time, producers are exploring a different character. 
“Clarice,” CBS’s newest television show, is the first instance of a network venturing away from Hannibal’s tantalizing storyline and instead focusing all its attention on the intriguing Clarice Starling. 
Disappointingly, the show fails to live up to the high bar set by its predecessor, but, despite a messy premise, it’s executed well. 
“Clarice” presents itself as an emotional spin on the movie in the format of a dark crime drama. The show reintroduces Starling inside her therapist’s office where he proclaims that she is an agent who “needs to be out of rotation until she can heal from PTSD of the most egregious kind.” (4:30)  
“Clarice” starts off promising, but it soon becomes apparent that the plotline (at least in the first episode) is one big crime show cliché where the main character must push aside her internal demons in order to catch the bad guy. 
By following the overused tropes of an average TV crime drama, “Clarice” stays too safe to pay accurate homage to the greatness of Demme’s 1991 film, which wasn’t afraid to take it to the next level and shock viewers. 
“Clarice” by itself would be a solid run-of-the-mill production, but compared to its predecessor, it seems mediocre. 
However, the show does have strong components. It does an incredible job at depicting how Clarice’s trauma manifests itself while working on crime scenes and navigating interpersonal relationships. She is scarred from having let a psychopath into her head, being hunted in a dark basement by a serial killer and tossed around as a patsy for the press for the past year. 
Rebecca Breeds, the actress who plays Clarice, executes the character beautifully. Viewers watch Clarice suffer from intense flashbacks riddled with moths, screaming lambs and horrific images of Buffalo Bill’s lair. We feel her pain, and it is captivating. Her battle with post-traumatic stress disorder and its damaging psychological effects is arguably more interesting than her attempts to catch a serial killer. 
Despite the show having tremendous potential for an alluring storyline, the showrunners ignore Clarice’s diminishing mental health and instead focus on forcing her back into the field to tackle criminals. The decision to push Clarice back into the field — and make her mental issues secondary — seems like a cheap attempt by the showrunners to deal with the fact they do not have the rights to use the name Hannibal Lecter. 
The production did not get the rights to the Hannibal name and is only allowed to allude to his presence. MGM and the Dino De Laurentiis Company share the rights to Thomas Harris’ characters, the author of the books “Clarice” is based on, and only granted CBS the right to use all of the characters introduced in Harris’s 1988 novel “Silence of the Lambs.”  However, Lecter was not introduced in this work but in the 1981 novel, “Red Dragon,” meaning CBS can hint at him but never outright mention his name. 
Lecter was one of the main causes of Clarice’s PTSD, and because the show cannot mention his name, it cannot completely dive into her trauma either and would not be able to execute that storyline well if it tried. This results in a mediocre plot based on popular television clichés, ranging from the “back off, this is my case” trope to the “main character has a hunch that no one else believes in” trope, instead of an intensive look into Clarice’s PTSD and mental health. 
Although the script and foundation of “Clarice” appear to be just like every other crime drama on television, the execution on and off camera is what gives this show a fighting chance. 
Breeds gives a performance that would make Jodie Foster, the original actress for Clarice in the 1991 film, proud. The raw, subtle emotion that graces her face is beautiful and undeniable. Her performance is haunting and her star quality is evident from her first moments on screen. 
The show is carried by Breeds’ remarkable emotional range, stellar music and cinematography. One of the strengths of “Silence of the Lambs” was its ability to make the audience feel pain or trepidation from a well-placed camera or the pacing of a song. Here, the haunting, consistent background music does more to invoke the audience’s emotions than the actual script. It tells a story that doesn’t need any dialogue. And, when combined with a handful of remarkable camera angles, a masterpiece is created. It’s a beautiful show, and a worthy follow-up to “Silence” in that aspect. 
“Clarice” has many faults, but it would be a shame to count this show out. It may have faltered in its first episode but deserves time to find its footing.

Lately, it seems TikTok is unavoidable. From hearing students and professors make references to the platform in chats and conversations over Zoom calls to seeing the popular short-form content infiltrating the feeds of Twitter and Instagram — whether we like it or not, TikTok is becoming ingrained in contemporary pop culture. 
Formerly known as Musical.ly, the app was created for users to share videos of themselves lip syncing to their favorite songs. Though that trend still exists and is widely popular among users, the use of TikTok as a catapult to fame and greater success in the music industry has also seen a significant rise in the past year. 
Social media and the virtual world have been taking the reins over pop culture even before the pandemic began. But with further onset of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, TikTok, now reaching over a billion downloads, quickly became the place for new artists to share their music and old artists to have a second wind of stardom. 
Songs have topped the charts with viral dance challenges to accompany them, singers have been signed to record deals and old music has been brought back into the mainstream — one wouldn’t question why artists are being told by their record labels to hop on board the trend.
The magnitude of social media’s power to completely uproot people’s lives hasn’t changed since the beginning. In the same way social media always has, TikTok is being used to propel the new wave of young (and old) talent forth at a time when people are searching for a sense of entertainment, relatability and belonging. 
Remember the term “one-hit wonder?” Old hits such as “Come on Eileen,” “Tainted Love” and “Take on Me” fall under this classification, granting mainstream popularity to artists solely for their one piece of work. But if that term still applied today in a new way, what would we use to describe those that gain almost instant popularity and fade out from the scene soon after? Has the phrase “15 minutes of fame” turned even smaller? I would argue so. 
People are going viral these days faster than ever. 
Now instead of “15 minutes of fame,” it’s become “15 seconds.” Even Spotify has playlists dedicated to “Viral Hits” and “Internet People.” Though social media allows more artists to rise and flourish during the pandemic, I can only help but wonder if these “Viral Hits” will sustain the same stamina and longevity of the “one-hit wonders” that came before. With content getting shorter and media entertainment becoming more accessible than ever, young people become the pacemakers in deciding the next big trends in music. 
There’s no doubt that TikTok is bringing new tunes to the turntable and even reviving old ones such as Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 hit “Dreams” and even more recently popularized in the 19th century — the sea shanty. However it all went down, I know I’m not complaining about it. 
By now, if you’ve been steeped in pop culture phenomena for the past few months, you likely know of the TikTok that brought a significant rise in streams to the iconic song “Dreams” and made the track suddenly relevant again among Generation Z who didn’t grow up in the era when the song was at its height. Does Ocean Spray cranberry juice ring a bell? In Oct. 2020, an Idaho man went viral, blissfully skateboarding to the song while drinking from a gallon bottle of cran-raspberry juice. Later retweeted by Stevie Nicks herself, the singer also took to TikTok to strap up her roller skates and sing along to her infamous hit. 
Don’t stop there, though. If you’ve only discovered Fleetwood Mac within the past few months or haven’t explored much of their discography, I suggest giving “Rumours” a good listen.
So, what will be next in line to have a 21st century pandemic comeback?
Look no further. You probably would’ve never guessed it, but sea shanties are on the rise. And I’m not mad about it. It began with a man named Nathan Evans’ viral sea shanty cover of “The Wellerman,” which landed him a record deal. That’s right, a real life record deal with Polydor Records. Not many people can say they have signed with a label because of a TikTok video gone viral, let alone a sea shanty cover. Given Evans does have a noteworthy voice, this just goes to show anything is possible these days and the world is your oyster. 
If you’re among the shanty-loving fanatics of today, check out “Blow the Man Down” — the song and the movie. It’s a catchy one and a plus if you like an indie film with a great score and cast.
Almost daily, the music industry and social media platforms are growing more and more interconnected, bouncing off of one another to find fresh talent and reach new heights. Just a few days ago, Universal Music Group and TikTok announced a global alliance that allows the platform full access to UMG’s catalogue of artists. This would benefit both the users along with the artists signed to the label. 
As exciting as it is, I love that songs from decades ago are regaining recognition, specifically among the younger generations. It’s almost surprising to see. Though I didn’t grow up in the ‘60s, ’70s, ’80s or ’90s, I have an immense appreciation for the music produced during those decades and believe music is capable of being cyclical, maybe just reproduced and reimagined in different ways than before. 
Whether it’s 19th century melodies, early 2000s hits or classic ’70s jams, trends come full circle and the beat always lives on.

USC has been an incubator for many successful business moguls and corporations — from Sean Rad of Tinder to Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Brandon Beck of Riot Games. However, when aspiring-entrepreneur Rishi Armstrong was a freshman, he noticed that, unlike schools such as UC Berkeley and Stanford University, USC had a lack of opportunities for the vibrant student start-up community to receive funding. 
In an effort to change this, Armstrong, along with five other students, founded Azure Ventures Group, a new business startup club that strives to encourage up-and-coming student entrepreneurs by providing capital, consulting and business training. 
The group first started last fall by developing their organization and networking with partners  such as Alpha Kappa Psi, Keck School of Medicine, Trojan Consulting Group and USC faculty and alumni. Having established connections with partners to provide necessary resources including legal and financial infrastructure and marketing, AVG looks to begin its services this semester once they accept applications that were due Feb. 8. 
“What we want to do is be an initial first investor in small startups at USC that we see as promising,” said Director of Finance Steven Vorona, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “We want to give them strategic guidance, business development advice and in the end, use our network, our connections and our pool of talent to help propel USC students to larger rounds of fundraising and connect them with the right people in the industry for their company.” 
The group’s program is divided into three main objectives: AVG Grow, AVG Invest and AVG Build. 
AVG Grow guides startups in the process of cultivating their minimum viable product — an early prototype with features to attract investors — and developing a comprehensive business plan to mobilize startups in producing revenue. AVG Invest educates student members about private equity and venture capital through engaging opportunities in investment companies. AVG Build recruits students who are not involved in a startup to gain hands-on experience working in entrepreneurship through business development, technology marketing and other areas. 
For their AVG Grow application, Azure Ventures Group seeked startups that operate using asset light business models and create high market demand that are projected to scale within one to two years. According to Business Standard, businesses who use an asset light model do not rely upon significant capital expenditures to enter the marketplace or are characterized typically in relatively inexpensive capital assets. 
Vice President of Azure Ventures Group Shaan Patel said he was inspired by his parents and family to pursue entrepreneurship who created their own business. Through Azure Ventures Group, he said he hopes to encourage other college students and provide them with the right tools and guidance to implement their new ideas. 
“What we wanted to do is be able to show that people have a chance to be able to create what they want, and they don’t have to just follow a traditional job path,” said Patel, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Even though [USC students are] young, they can create something and create a business, and creating a business is not something you have to do when you’re 40 years old or 50 years old; it’s something you can do while you’re in college.” 
The Azure Ventures Group e-board also wants to utilize its platform to create equitable opportunities for all entrepreneurs, especially for marginalized groups. Patel said they believe having a diverse team with different perspectives and talents is essential to help a startup’s growth and progression. 
 “We’re leveling the playing field for entrepreneurs as well as people who want to get involved in these industries that have usually been dominated by majority groups,” said Armstrong, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “We’re offering a lot of opportunities for these members of these communities to join and get educated and prepare themselves for what they want to do in the future.”
In the future, Azure Ventures Group aspires to contribute to entrepreneurs outside of USC and increase the number of startups they support, Vorona said. 
“We want to build this into the premier investment club and venture capital club on campus where any founder, no matter what background they’re from, if they have a great product or a [minimum viable product], they come straight to us,” Armstrong said. “After this semester, we’re looking to increase our [funding] by a pretty sizable amount so after that we will be able to have much more impact as well on the startups that we’re able to invest in.”

“Where do I fit if I cannot moan.” In “The Just and The Blind,” spoken word artist Marc Bamuthi Joseph explores the battle between fear and love through a tense dialogue between a Black father and son. The multimedia performance screened Tuesday through Visions and Voices and is in collaboration with musician and composer Daniel Bernard Roumain and flexing pioneer Drew Dollaz.
The show originally debuted in 2019 as a part of Carnegie Hall’s Create Justice Forum. Now, Joseph, Dollaz and Roumain perform in three separate locations, but the content only becomes stronger as the creators explore racial justice efforts in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
During an audience Q&A, Joseph revealed his spoken word poetry was the oldest component of the work. His poetry takes the audience through the journey of a Black father growing out of an age when he’s most vulnerable to injustice at the hands of the American legal system as his son enters that same age bracket. Roumain’s provides a chilling accompaniment, while Dollaz’s improvised movements imbue the piece with raw unexpected emotion, emphasizing the tragedy that is boyhood disrupted. Dollaz describes his preference for improvisation as “always revealing feelings [as they come] in the moment.”
Joseph’s poetry opens with a father’s anxious testimony. He describes afternoons outrunning doormen on the Upper East Side in a nostalgic tone making it clear these spats were simply a young boy’s innocent search for excitement: “Of all the genders, boys are the most stupid.” 
The following short narrates a timeline of demonization: Age three is where “Black boy beauty probably peaks,” entrance into the public school system at age six – in Oakland this time – is where instructors “beat the drum out of him,” and during the teen years, “all signs of Black boy cute go away.” This narration outlines the emotional roadblocks imposed by the American legal system’s denial of Black boyhood.
This realization defines the tension between father and son. In the following piece, “17 Reasons Why I Smoke Weed,” the performance takes a comical turn in which Joseph champions the medical uses of marijuana; “I’ve seen it heal my family.” But he also admits to using marijuana to ease the “PTSD from just walking around in my Black body.” 
Yet, in “Three Reasons Why My Son’s Car Should Not Smell like Weed,” he staunchly chastises his son caught in this same act. The sudden tonal shift mirrors the stakes surrounding the message he pleas for his child to understand: One legal reason to search can end his life.
“I instinctively assume that jail in Senegal sucks worse than jail in the states.” Joseph goes on to highlight the irony of perpetuating U.S. nationalism while being shunned by the country. It’s American identity the narrator calls on in an encounter with Senegalese police, but when this appeal doesn’t work, an already desperate identity crisis is only heightened. While the speaker doesn’t feel entirely American, he also realizes he wants to build a legacy in and lay claim to the country built on his ancestors’ backs.
Another double crisis is presented in a monologue dedicated to Ahmaud Arbery which Joseph shares he had not written until after the events of Arbery’s murder during the coronavirus pandemic. “Symptomatic said systemic violence sadistic bigots and a complicit network of badges and judges.” The addition of this piece provides a concise analysis of systemic racism. The unending and virus-like cycles of racist acts makes the father certain that racism is embedded in American society as he grows older. Instead of curing Americans, he calls the audience to set our sights on changing the system that allows perpetrators to use it for an outlet of their hate. 
It’s easy to assume the American legal system is the target of the performance’s critique, but this focus is soon forgone in favor of exploring a more sinister fear: a learned fear of oneself. “Your dad thinks about crossing the street when he meets someone who looks just like you,” the father bemoans. In “Fear,” images of young men in constant conflict with one another overlay Joseph’s description of self-hate. After living life as a Boogey-man in the shadows of America, the narrator forgets his own image, developing a sinister sense of self-hatred that passes on for generations.  
The performance closes with a painful exclamation, “Bury me in the struggle for freedom.” This struggle isn’t defined by interactions with white supremacists’ interests, but expressions of love to counter fear.
“In defiance of silence, we claim the right to love,” Joseph said while some assume making such weighty work can be fatiguing, this creative expression and collaboration is how he expresses love and heals from fear.
Make no mistake – “The Just and the Blind” is a heavy performance that doesn’t shy away from discussing all the tragedy that comes with the American carceral system. However, recognizing the cyclical and unending nature of racism, Joseph calls on Black men to prioritize healing through radical self-love.

Soon after entering the world of online learning, several members of the School of Architecture noticed something missing: the normally in-person studio space, where students could walk around to their peers’ desks, ask questions and converse about projects. This created a close and collaborative environment between all the graduate students.
Interested in recreating this environment, architecture master’s students JP Luikart, Louise Rogier and Shay Mirzaei created the Architecture Studio Buddies program to bring an essential part of the student experience to a virtual forum.
“We can pretty much only see our own (at home) studios and that already creates a gap between the year that we’re currently in ourselves because we can’t even see what our colleagues that are in the same year as I start doing, let alone, seeing what the year above or below us are doing” Mirzaei said.
In a time when many school communal environments are unavailable to enhance a student’s campus experience, the Buddies Program has pushed past barriers to ensure support for new and old members of the studio space program, Mirzaei said.
For some, it’s a way of receiving advice on projects and classes. For others, it can involve working on projects together or forming new connections within the program. 
Mirzaei was paired with a first-year graduate student who shared her previous experience studying psychology as an undergraduate student. Mirzaei said the two made a strong connection, talking about classes, the transition between psychology and architecture, and how the program had evolved since Mirzaei’s first year.  
The pairings in the mentorship program were created strategically. Students filled out detailed questionnaires about their hobbies and interests within architecture. Overall, the pairings have been successful and Mirzaei said she received a lot of positive responses from the students involved.
“There’s been other people that have reached out to me about how much they love the program or there’s been people that didn’t have the chance to participate, partially because …  it’s an additional thing in your schedule and they’re probably nervous, but they’ve been reaching out and asking for another round of this (program),” Mirzaei said.
The challenge for the Buddies Program originally was finding the correct means to replace such an essential environment, Luikart said. With each student at a different point in their academic career, whether as new students or finishing their degree, the program needed to incorporate all stages of learning for students. It also required an aspect of flexibility, especially since students already spend hours online in class and are busy with an assortment of their own commitments. 
“That’s why it took a while to develop this particular solution because everyone’s sort of in it for something different,” Luikart said. “(We came) up with something that’s flexible enough that if you want to talk about only work that’s fine and if you want to talk about nothing relating to work, you just want someone to relax with, that’s fine too.”
At the start of the fall semester, an online mixer was hosted to introduce architecture graduate students to the Buddies Program. People were able to mingle with other students through the program Murmur, which allowed students to move around the virtual room and converse freely with various groups of students. 
At the time of the mixer, the program had around 40 students and has since continued to grow, with some participating from various time zones across the world.  
“For as dispersed as everyone is, to have anything that brings folks together like this has been super successful,” Luikart said.  
Architecture graduate student Aspen Thurman, who is a mentor for a first-year student, commends how helpful the program has been and said she wishes she had a mentor when she was a freshman.
“(My mentee) and I just talked for… like four hours and had a great time talking and she asked me so many questions about the program and upcoming classes and I tried to give her as much as my advice as possible and told her that if she needs any help at any point that I’m more than happy to help,” Thurman said. “She even talked about Zooming to do studio work together, which was really cool; I think we’re going to do that soon.”
Although the program was created out of necessity as courses were conducted online, Mirzaei said the program looks to continue even after a return to in-person classes.
“They’ve lived through literally the same exact process that you’re going through and I think that that’s really helpful,” Mirzaei said in reference to the older graduate students helping earlier members. “I don’t think that will change based on if we’re online or not.”

For months, farmers in India have been protesting against agricultural bills passed by Prime Minister Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in September. The bills will privatize farms, making farmers vulnerable to corporate exploitation, putting the livelihoods of farmers at stake during the coronavirus pandemic. These agricultural policies are merely the tipping point for the farmers’ movement in India. 
The degradation of farmers’ economy, health and environment has long been neglected by the Indian government, who once caused harmful consequences by introducing corporate control into farming regions
As farmers reach their tipping point, India’s right-wing government is attacking vocal religious minority groups, convicting journalists, tear gassing protestors and shutting down the internet. Farmers in India are leading the largest protest in human history and finally have the world’s attention. Despite this, right-wing Hindu nationalists target figures who have spoken out about the crisis, like Rihanna and Greta Thunberg, burning their photos on stakes. The world is watching and nationalists continue engaging in harassment and violence under the protection of the state — sound familiar? 
The interconnectedness of former President Donald Trump’s America and Modi’s India reveals the fragility behind hollow claims of democracy and unity. India, the most populous democracy in the world, and the United States, the oldest democracy in the world, are two nations threatened by right-wing supporters who have been emboldened by their nation’s leaders. 
It is understandable that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around the details of what is happening in India. It would be nearly impossible for even the most overzealous student activist to be engaged in every human rights crisis — even during the age of social media slacktivism. However, it is imperative to recognize these international dynamics of democratic instability as timely. 
Militant nationalism is still on the rise and the only way to fight it back is through accountability. The farmers in India, many of whom are elders and women, are organizing on the ground level to do just that. They are demonstrating en masse on the streets of Delhi while facing horrific state violence.
Early this year, the Punjabi diaspora mobilized in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom through protests and car rallies to stand in solidarity with the farmers in India. The international community at large has shown support for farmers on social media to raise awareness and gain attention from world leaders. After one tweet from Rihanna about the farmers’ protests, western media outlets started to increase coverage and other celebrity figures started to speak out. 
Organizations like the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have condemned India for its dangerous regression in free speech rights in pursuit of its Hindu Nationalist agenda. Yet, after condemnation from Greta Thunberg, numerous U.S. Congress members and other world leaders, the office of the president still has not spoken out. 
While there are much more complex foreign policy repercussions involving trade relations and strategic alliances for the United States to consider, taking a stance against facism is imperative. As the United States grapples with systemic racism and other domestic human rights violations following a Capitol insurrection, the world will be watching to see how it responds to nationalism abroad as well. 
If President Joe Biden’s Administration seeks to undo the wrongdoings of the Trump Administration, they must take a strong stance on human rights abroad too. From the U.S.-Mexico border crisis to travel bans, the Trump Administration has heavily contributed to America’s diminishing credibility on international human rights. Now, more than ever, the Biden Administration must address facism abroad if it wants to remain a credible actor in protecting democracy. The world is watching.
