Jenny Chung | Daily TrojanYour vote, your voice · USC’s Unruh Institute of Politics and 10 other organizations set up booths next to Tommy Trojan on Tuesday and offered students the forms they needed to register to vote in California.
As many as 500 students are now eligible to vote in the November general election, thanks to the efforts of 11 campus organizations that participated in USC’s National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in partnership with the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s office, USC Undergraduate Student Government, USC Political Student Assembly, USC College Republicans, USC College Democrats and other USC student organizations held the registration drive to help USC students complete their voter registration in Los Angeles County.
Voter turnout among millennials has reached an all-time low in past elections and is the lowest it has been in 40 years. As of 2014, an estimated 69.2 million millennials — adults between the ages of 18 and 35 — were voting-age, yet only 42 percent of millennials were registered to vote, according to the Campus Vote Project.
Meghan Ginley, the community engagement director for the Unruh Institute, hopes that college students will voice their opinion and vote in November.
“Millennials could have a huge impact on this election if we get them out to vote,” Ginley said. “Something I have noticed working with students is that a lot of millennials are either very engaged or the complete opposite and very apathetic. So what we want to do is help the people who are apathetic find something that they are passionate about and are interested in getting engaged with.”
It’s a demographic that both candidates are having to work hard to convince. According to polls, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have trouble appealing to young voters. Donte Miller, the external affairs director for Graduate Student Government, said that this could account for low voter turnout among millennials.
“It’s a mixture of both the climate and people not liking either candidate,” Miller said. “It’s a mixture of apathy and unwillingness to just vote, the belief that it doesn’t matter if we vote. But it matters.”
Many millennial voters were in support of Senator Bernie Sanders, who spoke about student debt and providing resources to college students.
Pew Research Center findings show that millennials not only have more debt than any other generation in U.S. history, but also face higher unemployment than the past two generations.
“I think it’s important that people exercise their right to know what is going on,” Miller said. “It’s important that students get out in their community and are aware of what is going on so they can.”
Jonathan Zhang, a senior majoring in architecture and a member of USC College Democrats, stressed it would be too detrimental to the nation not to cast a vote.
“I’m voting because I think the stakes are extremely high in this election, and it does seem like it doesn’t matter,” Zhang said. “But you have to do your part and you have to realize that you’re one of many people.”

USC was ranked 15th in the Wall Street Journal’s “The Top U.S. Colleges” report released Tuesday, placing it eight spots above its position in the 2017 U.S. News & World Report’s list of “Best Colleges.”
The Wall Street Journal rankings are unique as they analyze students’ opinions on the quality of their education and their postgraduate success, rather than SAT scores or acceptance rates. The University’s score is based on a seven-question survey of 100,000 college students. Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led the rankings.
Phil Baty, an editor at Times Higher Education, praised these rankings in the Wall Street Journal article.
“[This ranking] is driven entirely by what matters most to students and families,” Baty said. “The survey gets to the heart of what good teaching really is and how much a university is capable of stimulating and engaging students.”
The universities are ranked based on four categories: student outcomes, school resources, university engagement with its students and learning environment or diversity. USC was given a high overall score of 88.3 percent, with individual scores of 95 percent for outcomes,  86 percent for resources, 83.5 percent for engagement and  78 percent for environment.
Similarly to U.S. News & World Report’s list, the Wall Street Journal’s rankings have received some scrutiny for favoring private universities. Public colleges did not make the top 20, as they have fewer resources, including a smaller spending budget, larger student-faculty ratios and lower research output.
“Tighter budgets can affect class sizes, graduation rates, faculty hiring and the extent to which a school can offer grants rather than loans in a financial-aid package,” the Wall Street Journal article stated.
Well done! It seems to have risen in the Times global rankings as well, where it is now 60th (Oxford is 1st).
We are now ranked higher than UCLA, UC Berkeley and Notre Dame among other very good universities.  Well done, USC…..and never stop ascending!
Nice job.  However, it doesn’t surprise me that USC ranks high on a survey that measures “students’ opinions on the quality of their education”, rather than a survey done using tangible, non-subjective data.  Students of USC are some of the biggest cheerleaders of their school that I’ve seen.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanSecond time around · ASU is expected to dial up blitzes on redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, who will make his home debut.
Fresh off a difficult loss at Utah, the Trojans returned to Los Angeles with a 1-3 record and a fresh hunger to secure a victory at home this weekend. The mood at practice was less playful and more focused. Players shouted occasional suggestions or encouragement, but the tone was clearly set — it’s time to for the team to figure itself out.
“They really got after it today,” head coach Clay Helton said. “They know that they’ve improved from week to week, from Alabama to Stanford, from Stanford to Utah. The last piece is knocking out the little things and to do that the attention to detail has to be done. I think they’re glued in right now.”
Aggressive ASU
Despite the loss, redshirt freshman Sam Darnold dazzled in his debut as the new starting quarterback for the Trojans, racking up 253 yards and completing 18 of his 26 passes. He rushed 41 yards and ran in a touchdown himself. It was the type of performance that solidified the team’s faith in Helton’s decision to move Darnold to the starting position.
“When you have a versatile of a quarterback as Sam with the desire to step up, the desire to play, to want to win, to put out and show and play like he did — he did great,” offensive tackle Zach Banner said. “We as a unit have a lot to work on. We gotta take care of the ball. But I couldn’t be more proud of Sam.”
Yet Darnold’s performance wasn’t enough to hold off a fourth-quarter comeback from Utah. After last weekend, Helton put most of his pressure on the offense, which allowed three turnovers and took far less snaps than Utah on Saturday.
The upcoming set of teams that the Trojans are slated to play — Arizona State, Colorado, Arizona and California — are known for their up-tempo, aggressive style of play. This weekend, the Sun Devils are expected to blitz early and often, which will force Darnold to prove himself under pressure in the pocket.
“Any time you play Coach Graham’s defense, get ready for pressure,” Helton said. “They’re going to blitz, you know it coming in. I would expect that with a young quarterback, he’s chomping on the bit, expecting to pressure.”
Banner responds
Former Trojan running back Lendale White sparred with Banner on Saturday, calling the offensive tackle out on Twitter for shaking opponents’ hands after the loss to Utah.
White’s original tweet read, “#73 bra u need to get it together. Big ass teddy bear all u wanna do is shake hands.” The post sparked an argument that lasted through Sunday, with Banner calling White “irrelevant” and White responding with taunts of “teddy bear” and “fake a$& ‘Hollywood’ players” and shooting back an unflattering picture of Banner.
After the altercation, Banner removed several of the posts from his Twitter, but not the most recent string, which ended by saying, “You know dam [sic] well that we played our asses off. Mistakes happen, and we can’t change the outcome afterwords [sic]. Grow up man!”
White has posted negative tweets about the USC team, and about Banner in particular, several times throughout this season. At practice, Banner was apologetic for how he handled the issue on Twitter, but didn’t back down from defending his team.
“I don’t feel dumb for sticking up for my team,” Banner said. “But I feel dumb for doing it on Twitter. I don’t take any words back that I said. That’s locker room talk and that should’ve been said in the locker room. I just don’t want past players shooting down our players.”

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan · After starting his first full season as head coach 1-3, Clay Helton is under fire from critics who say he isn’t the right coach for the job. Now Helton is preparing the Trojans to face ASU Saturday.
Now that we’ve had a couple of days to digest a furiously frustrating loss to Utah this past weekend, I’d like to throw in one more perspective on what happened before fans shift their focus to ASU. Yes, USC blew it. Yes, this is one the Trojans really needed in divisional play, and is one they really should have had.
But there’s one thing I won’t concede, and that Trojan fans need to quit saying for the rest of the season: head coach Clay Helton did not throw the game away by calling for a punt on USC’s last full drive.
Maybe the Trojans would have hung on if they had gone for it. Hindsight, as always, is 20/20. But it was a perfectly rational decision in an unpredictable scenario.
We all remember the final result. Helton calls for a punt, Utah goes 93 yards and scores with 16 seconds left in the game to win. Cue the dozens of tweeters I follow calling it an inexplicable decision, with some already calling for Helton’s head. But let’s look at the actual decision again.
Fourth down, three yards to go. From Utah’s 37-yard line. Up 27-24. About 5:30 left in the game.
A field goal attempt would be 54 yards, out of redshirt junior kicker Matt Boermeester’s range. Redshirt sophomore punter Chris Tilbey has yet to be used in the game, but has been reasonably effective at pinning opponents deep — of his three punts inside Stanford territory the week before, two were downed within Stanford’s 10-yard line and one went for a touchback.
The offense has three turnovers, two touchdowns and two field goals on seven drives. The defense has recorded three stops and one turnover but surrendered three touchdowns and one field goal on eight full drives.
There’s enough time left for Utah to complete a full drive. Giving the ball back to Utah on downs from its own 35 would still require a long drive to take the lead.
But the defense has looked good so far. Tilbey looks like a very solid bet to pin the Utes within their own 10. That’s a long way to go for evenly matched opponents. One full stop is likely all the defense needs to seal the victory with the amount of time left on the clock.
Three yards certainly wouldn’t fall under any classification as a long conversion, but it is by no means a safe bet short yard situation. In fact, the most thorough statistical analysis I found on the probability of a fourth down conversion — from the analytics website Football Outsiders, looking at NFL data from 2010-2012 — only included fourth down situations of two yards or shorter in its analysis.
A fourth-and-one or fourth-and-inches sets up a very safe quarterback sneak scenario, usually successful even when the defense undoubtedly sees it coming. Two yards is still a long way for a running back to go when a defense is expecting a run. By three yards, the odds are almost as good that an offense will go away from a power run and instead for a play action rollout, which can easily end with an incomplete pass.
This is a key distinction that almost everyone left out when comparing Helton’s playcalling to that of Utah’s Kyle Whittingham. Utah went for it on four fourth downs, and converted on all four tries. But all of them were fourth-and-one attempts, and Whittingham simply called for a rush play on each attempt. These decisions simply do not belong in the same category.
The other noteworthy criticism thrown around Twitter by USC fans is how eerily similar this defensive collapse by the Trojans was, given that the Utes scored a game-winning touchdown on their last drive when the Trojans were at Utah in 2014. It was almost déjà vu, with the Trojans being too conservative and letting Utah back in.
Except the last time the Trojans gave away a late lead at Utah, the coaching staff went for the exact opposite fourth-down approach on its final drive. Up 21-17 with just over 2:00 left in the game, from Utah’s 28-yard line, with veteran kicker Andre Heidari certainly in his field goal range, the Trojans went for the dagger on a fourth-and-two. They went for it, opting to try to bleed the rest of the clock out instead of give Utah the ball back with a 7-point lead. Sure enough, the Trojans were stopped short of the first down, and the Utes marched 73 yards to score the game-winning touchdown with only eight seconds to spare.
There’s only one reasonable conclusion I can come to after looking at this fourth-and-three decision at length: it’s a complete toss-up. Sure, maybe the staff made the wrong decision in both 2014 and 2016. Maybe a stats guru could calculate the exact likelihood of winning under each scenario, and the results aren’t completely unpredictable.
The important thing is that Trojan fans absolutely need to abandon these Monday Morning Quarterback assessments of Helton’s coaching abilities six games into his permanent role.
The Trojans have hit two opponents they were not supposed to compete with. They are 0-1 on the road against evenly matched opponents. The struggles of LSU, Oregon and Notre Dame show that rough opening months are possible with even the most storied programs — and that at least two of the Trojans’ big remaining challengers might be much more beatable than anticipated.
“Helton coaches not to lose; he needs to coach to win!” is the most unintelligent comment a fan can possibly utter. Football coaches may occasionally be irrationally risk averse, but fans and commentators will always have a hindsight bias. Punting inside an opponent’s territory with a one-possession lead is not inherently stupid. Refusing to do so is.
The more important questions Helton has to address is team discipline. The turnovers, and especially the penalties, have been killer. Questions about his personnel usage are also more legitimate — we shall see if senior tailback Justin Davis’ performance Saturday was a flash in the pan or a sign of his emergence as an elite go-to back. Utah is definitely now in the driver’s seat in the division, but the Trojans are not out of that race. Helton and the Trojans deserve the chance to show what they can do during the rest of the conference battle.

Photo courtesy of Sports InformationNever say die · Sophomore Robynn Ree led the team at 5-under on Tuesday to help the Women of Troy to a 13-stroke comeback victory.
Entering the final round of play Tuesday morning at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate in Orlando, the No. 2 women’s golf team was tied for fourth in the team standings with No. 4 Georgia at 12-under. USC trailed then-leading No. 1 UCLA by 13 strokes to begin Tuesday’s final round of play at the Reunion Resort.
In the third round on Tuesday, USC recorded a team score of 12-under and clinched first place at the ANNIKA Intercollegiate for the second consecutive season. Overall, the Women of Troy won the tournament with a team score of 24-under; formerly leading UCLA finished in third place (-20) after shooting 5-over in the final round Tuesday.
“We know that every one of these girls is capable of shooting a low round,” head coach Andrea Gaston said. “The hardest part about the game of golf is forgetting what happened yesterday and starting fresh today; getting yourself in the right state of mind to play a great game of golf.”
Sophomore Robynn Ree shot a team-best 5-under in Tuesday’s final round. Ree finished the tournament tied for 17th overall with a final score of 4-under.
“[Ree] has a great way about her — she’s a fast player, and she’s a smart player,” Gaston said. “She made some really solid adjustments out there and boom, she ended up shooting a 5-under for us.”
The Women of Troy’s top-scorer in the tournament was redshirt senior Victoria Morgan, who finished at 7-under; this score tied her for eighth overall in the tournament’s individual leaderboard.
“[Our team] knew that if we each individually just played our own games, then we had a chance to win,” Morgan said.  “We all believed in ourselves, but [when we actually won], there was a feeling of utter surprise … I’ve been playing here for four years, and we’ve never come back like this, and I don’t think I’ve seen any other team come back like this.”
All five USC golfers finished in the top 25 of the player leaderboard at ANNIKA this week.
A 4-under performance from senior Karen Chung in the final round Tuesday propelled her to a 25th-place finish overall in the tournament (-2). Seniors Tiffany Chan and Gabriella Then finished the tournament tied for 17th (-4) along with Ree.
“It’s a great feeling knowing that we are the defending champions [of this ANNIKA tournament] now,” Gaston said. “[Winning here] is definitely a very great and exciting way to start off our season.”
Following the season-opening ANNIKA Intercollegiate win, the team will next travel to the Glen View Club in Chicago to compete at the Windy City Collegiate Classic on Oct. 3-4.

In the Fall of 2013, Marvel and Netflix announced a partnership that promised four live action television shows that would revolutionize the modern streaming service. This partnership would take four individual heroes: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Ironfist and assemble it’s own mini Avengers. These four heroes would spread its programming across a few years of Netflix streaming which could then possibly collaborate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe once the streaming contract is over if not extended.
Photo courtesy of Marvel EntertainmentSuper villain · Luke Cage’s newest show is part of the 2003 collaboration between Marvel and Netflix. It features characters such as Daredevil, Jessica Jones and other Avengers characters.s
Traditionally, corporations such as DC Comics and Marvel Studios would have their shows aired on live television networks such as Arrow on CW (DC) and Agents of Shield (ABC). Marvel’s deal made way for other companies to follow and put their trusts in streaming networks like Netflix, Hulu or Amazon.
Marvel started their streaming deal with the highly requested Daredevil which went on to have rave reviews and resulted in a second season which aired in Mar. 2016, along with a third season in the works. Shortly following the early Marvel/Netflix partnership hype, Jessica Jones one of the four Marvel Defenders made its appearance in the Marvel television universe. In the 13 episode season, Jessica Jones featured Luke Cage as more than an acquittance. Luke Cage is introduced in Jessica Jones as a quiet yet bold character. One worry to this early introduction however, is if Luke Cage will be able to stand alone as his own protagonist or live in the shadows of Jessica Jones and other Marvel Defenders.

Luke Cage takes place in Hell’s Kitchen — where all of the Defenders do their crime fighting — focusing in the area of Harlem. The series’ plot will be independent from those in the Jessica Jones series. There may be a few references made to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but it is still a standalone with its own villains, romances and action.
Luke Cage will also follow the roots of its rich comic book history starting from the 1970s. A character whose roots come from the blaxploitation genre, Luke Cage, played by Mike Colter, is a Harlem barbershop sweeper by day and a vigilante for the streets of Harlem by night. He uses his unbreakable skin as his weapon against up-and-coming actor Mahershala Ali as the New York drug kingpin antagonist.
The show has been advertised as unapologetically black, with a predominately African American cast and a soundtrack that consists of East Coast African American rap. All 13 episodes are named after songs from the rap group gang starr — a hip hop duo — who are originally from Brooklyn, New York. Having the show set in the African American cultural capital, Luke Cage looks to use many of its cultural aspects through its Harlem setting and east coast rap soundtrack inspired by black culture.
“[They] wanted to make something great, not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on [their] culture,” said executive producer, Cheo Hodari Coker to Netflix Street Level Hero Music Behind The Scenes video.
The original creators of Luke Cage drew most of its inspiration from crime/drama classic television such as the critically acclaimed show, The Wire.This original series will hold one of the most diverse casts in the 2016 season as it tries to appease the high expectations that the previous Defenders set. YesI literallyIl be on its way to Netflix as it releases all 13 episodes on Sept. 30.

Located on the busy Beverly Boulevard, Korean restaurant Sulga Jinju Gom Tang, also known as the “House of Beef Soup,” has opened for  a two month run and is going pretty well so far. It is actually the new location of the original Jinju Gomtang restaurant, which first started its business on the intersection of Western Avenue and West 6th Street, and relocated to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Alexandria Avenue after 20 years. Now, it has moved again—with the new name Sulga Jinju Gom Tang and a new menu offering various food options.
Sulga Jinju Gom Tang is best known for its “gomtang,” a traditional Korean soup with beef parts simm

It includes bugolgi, but vegetarian options are available. The restaurant is best known for its signature dish, knee cap soup.
ering on a low flame. The special part about gomtang is that, during the process of stewing, no additional seasonings are added — the broth usually has a milky color and a mellow, authentic taste, which is rich in protein and calcium.
At Sulga Jinju Gom Tang, most of the ingredients are organic, and even the water goes through three layers of filter. The owners of the restaurant emphasized that they never use MSG because they want to offer healthy and natural deliciousness. For them, watching customers leave with a satisfied and happy smile is the most important.
Knee cap soup is the signature dish here. Ox knee is cleaned detailedly, and cut into smaller pieces in front of customers when served at the table. Fresh meat and gelatin blend out perfectly in the hot and nutritious soup, and sea salt can be added to season the taste based on customer’s own preference.
Brisket with organic soup and cheek meat with organic soup are also popular — the meat is cooked for hours achieving great tenderness is presented, serving along with the cellophane noodles in the thick soup base. As for the ox tail soup, it comes with tonic ginseng and dates.
If one is not craving something warm in hot weather, try the Korean naengmyeon. Cold wild yam noodle and spicy wild yam noodle are topped with brisket slices, hard-boiled egg, pickled cucumbers and root vegetables. The seafood chive pancake is a tasty choice and good item to share with friends. Unlike regular seafood pancakes that are mainly made with flour paste, the ones at Sulga Jinju Gom Tang are made from eggs stuffed with plentiful chives.
Sulga Jinju Gom Tang also offers free beet and burdock drink with pine seed at the end. The service is extraordinarily great, and is probably one of the best in Los Angeles. Staff and owners are really friendly and are always attentive to customers’ needs. The dining environment is also comfortable — clean, bright, well-organized with spacious seating.

“Syrian refugees” has become a ubiquitous term. The faces of Syrians, young and old, are plastered across the news. Their acceptance into the United States has become a hot issue of debate among politicians. Yet, as often as the media likes to discuss Syrians, it is utterly astounding how clueless and complicit we as a nation are in response to all of the events in Syria. From the ongoing civil war to the refugee crisis at hand, there is no excuse for ignorance. The greatest proof of our negligence comes from our nation’s politicians: comments from Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson as well as  Donald Trump Jr. have both showcased widespread, regrettable ignorance and prejudice. With the creation and popularity of campus clubs like Students Teach for Syria, our own campus is now better suited than ever to move past the unfortunate and often racist rhetoric of the mainstream and conservative media and look toward a path of empathy, collaboration and problem-solving.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
After terrorist attacks shook much of the West up this past year, and with violence reigning across Europe, the immediate response was to withdraw support for refugee intake. Assigning the blame to Syrians and scapegoating them as the reason for our problems became the new norm. Given the vast amount of Islamophobia that has been born post-9/11, with the combination of preconceived Orientalist notions, blaming this group — the majority of whom are Arab and adherents of Islam — adds up. And turning back on a group that has already been so easily labeled as “other,” eases the conscience of those refusing to help, learn or care about Syria.
In the past, the same has gone for our own campus. The Undergrduate Student Government Senate did not pass the Syrian Consortium Bill, which would allow Syrian undergraduate students to acquire seats at USC for higher education, due to the fact that it would be disrespectful in light of the events in Paris (according to then-Senator Jacob Ellenhorn). Even figures of power, such as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., have tapped into this plethora of ignorance and have framed it into a weapon of fear, claiming that Syrians are enactors of violence rather than recognizing the reality of the situation — that Syrians are the victims of extreme violence, who are fleeing in pursuit of a better life.
What many fail to realize is that Syria was and is not as they perceive it to be; organizations like Students Teach for Syria help to quell this sort of misinformation. When thinking about the Middle East, the common stereotypes that are affiliated with it are oppression, barbarianism, and authoritarianism. However, Syria was a medium-income country, and its people enjoyed a vast amount of liberties, not the Orientalist ideas of Syria as a home country for violence.
Orientalism, a concept by philosopher Edward Said, accuses the West of painting an image of the Arab world; a barbaric homeplace for a violent, uncivilized people, yet at the same time are exotic, mysterious victims of this timelessness culture. But Damascus and Aleppo were far from uncivilized and violent; they were cultural centers, breeding a plethora of intellectuals, and the damage to these cities is a tragedy to the world. What once was a beautiful place is now a pile of rubble, a home destroyed to the chagrin of its people. And as many whine about the burden of accepting refugees, most have not had the experiences as many of these refugees have had; having escaped a war while having family still stuck in war-torn areas, having families divided, crossing treacherous routes and undergoing perilous journeys en route to a country whose governments have painted them as the enemy.
As a result of xenophobia, they have become victims of robbery and rape and, finally, even when being granted asylum, they face the struggles of learning a new language and the heartbreaking desires to return back home to their once-beloved Syria.
Syrians are not burdens, but rather people who have lost so much in a short span of time and who are in temporary need of refuge. They are not terrorists. They are not barbaric humans from the timeless and mystical east. They are not Skittles. And for the past six years, knowledge about the war in Syria has been minimal. It is in the hands of the students, of the youth, of the people, to start learning about Syria by way of its culture, of the war, of the language, of anything to welcome our new Americans. This can start on our campus, with our student body. The transparency of ignorance on Johnson’s face was catalyst enough to prove how much change is needed to better expand our world views and to learn more about Syrians.
Yusuf writes, “As a result of xenophobia, they have become victims of robbery and rape and, finally, even when being granted asylum, they face the struggles of learning a new language and the heartbreaking desires to return back home to their once-beloved Syria.”
+++
So you are saying that fellow Muslims (ISIS) are xenophobes for it is they who are committing robbery and rape.  Do you stand by this statement?
” But Damascus and Aleppo were far from uncivilized and violent; they were cultural centers, breeding a plethora of intellectuals, and the damage to these cities is a tragedy to the world.”
+++
Really?  So under the brutal generational dictatorship of the father and son Assad reign Damascus and Aleppo were civilized and peaceful?  Who do you think you are kidding?
But more importantly please tell us which Muslim countries are “civilized and peaceful”?  Let us take the “moderate” country of Turkey.  Is Turkey civilized and peaceful?  Why is it Turkey (once the second most important seat to Christianity) now 99% Muslim if it has been such a civilized and peaceful nation?  Why is it the Kurds in-and-around Turkey live in fear for their lives?  Why are there more Turkish journalists in jail than is true of any other country in the world?  Yes, this is correct, Turkey has imprisoned more journalists than even Iran.
“…have tapped into this plethora of ignorance and have framed it into a weapon of fear, claiming that Syrians are enactors of violence rather than recognizing the reality of the situation — that Syrians are the victims of extreme violence, who are fleeing in pursuit of a better life.”
+++
But the problem Yusuf is that far too many Muslim’s true intentions are impossible to know.  But even more than this what the West is discovering is that it it very often second and third generation Muslims who become the terrorists.  It is they who become devout Muslims, who learn that the Qur’an justifies killing infidels in the name of Islam and in the spread of Islam.  How would you suggest we protect our mothers and children from these Muslim terrorists?
“And turning back on a group that has already been so easily labeled as “other,” eases the conscience of those refusing to help, learn or care about Syria.”
+++
The group has been labeled “other” because this accurately describes Islam.  Hinduism is also “other” or different.  So is Buddhism or Animism, Mormonism, the Amish and Taoism, but none of these “others” embrace violence, repression, sadism and misogyny quite like Islam does.  And what I just wrote is true.
One does not hear of Buddhist women being forced to wear heavy, black cloth sacks in the desert.  One does mot hear about Hindus flying planes into buildings or torturing Jews to death.  One does not hear about Amish people beheading people because they are Christians or journalists.
“Given the vast amount of Islamophobia that has been born post-9/11, with the combination of preconceived Orientalist notions, blaming this group — the majority of whom are Arab and adherents of Islam — adds up.”
+++
According to the website “The Religion of Peace” as of yesterday there have been 29,327 Muslim terrorist attacks since 9/11.
Their website updates and inventories the attacks on a daily basis.  Their information includes the location of the attack, the number of people killed, the number of people wounded, the identity of the Muslim killer and the news source used to prove the attack occurred.
It offends me Yusuf that you gloss over this reality and pretend it is trivial.  You accuse people like me of being Islamophobes when in reality you are a Muslim apologist and I am simply acknowledging the reality that a lot of Muslims are crazed terrorists.

Q: Confession: I am the biggest procrastinator ever. How can I keep on track and be productive without the crazy crunch time anxiety?
Ahhh the good ol’ balance between procrastination and productivity. The journey of every college student … and the theme song of my life. 
If you’re trying to keep all of your tasks on track, I recommend a planner or an organized to-do list (or a bullet journal). It’ll make everything run smoother in your life, I promise. I personally like writing things down, but there are great apps out now to keep your life on track too. If you haven’t tried it yet, get the Momentum extension for Google Chrome! It has a to-do list on the bottom right-hand corner! Now, when you’re making this to-do list– remember the golden rule in life. Threes. Not only is three my favorite number but it makes things more doable. When you’re writing your to-do list everyday, pick three things you have to get done. Things you absolutely have to get done. Then, put down the other stuff you should/could do below it. As you make your way through the list, as long as you hit those top 3, you should be well on your way to productivity! Plus, if you’re feeling extra ambitious on any given day, you can do more to lessen your load for other days! 
Second, I think it’s important to think about why you’re procrastinating. Is it because you find something else, other than what you’re studying, to be more enjoyable? If so, would you want to pursue a career in that space? Are your studies and your interests intersecting? If not, they should be! Your interests will motivate you. There will be days when you don’t want to do work. In fact, you’ll dread it some days… but when you’re being pushed by your ambitions and your dreams, you’ll typically feel a greater need to finish your tasks. So, take a look at yourself and at what you’re doing. If you’re happy, keep on trekking! If you’re not, take a step back and reflect! Can’t hurt, especially since you might be reading this article while procrastinating… Gotcha!
