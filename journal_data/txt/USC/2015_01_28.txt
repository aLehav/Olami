The No. 12 ranked women’s swimming and diving team will head northbound to duel No. 1 California and No. 3 Stanford on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
USC is ranked No. 12 (4-1, 3-1) in the latest College Swimming Coaches Association of America while Cal (5-1, 4-0) is tied with Georgia at No. 1 and Stanford  (5-1, 4-0) is ranked No. 3.
U.S. Olympic gold medalist and Cal sophomore Missy Franklin is just one of the Bears’ swimmers boasting a top-10 time.
Juniors Elizabeth Pelton and Rachel Bootsma as well as freshman Cierra Runge are also in the top 10.
Franklin holds the NCAA’s best time in the 200-yard free and is second in the 200-yard back and 200-yard IM. Pelton is first in the 200-yard back and 200-yard IM and third in the 100-yard back. Bootsma is second in the 100-yard back. Runge is second in the 500-yard free.
After facing the NCAA’s best team, the Trojans will face another top-five opponent in the Cardinal.
Stanford is led by freshman Simone Manuel, who has the nation’s top times in the 50-yard and 100-yard free and is second in the 200-yard free. Senior Maddy Schaefer is fourth in the 50-yard free and 11th in the    100-yard free, sophomore Lia Neal is third in the 100-yard free and seventh in the 200-yard free, while freshman Janet Hu has top times in a variety of events.
The Trojans have top-25 swimmers of their own, including sophomore Chelsea Chenault’s time of 1:45.31 in the 200-yard free (14th) and 4:42.44 in the 500-yard free (21st).
Freshman Hannah Weiss posted  52.23 in the 100-yard back (13th). Junior Kendyl Stewart’s time of 51.99 in the 100-yard fly is the NCAA’s sixth best, and her time of 1:54.20 in the 200-yard back ranks her at 21st.
Senior Andrea Kropp’s 1:00.01 in the 100-yard breast is 13th, her time of 2:09.32 in the 200-yard breast is No. 10, and her time of 1:56.99 in the 200-yard IM is ninth best.
Rounding out USC’s top-25 swimmers is junior Jasmine Tosky’s 10th place time of 1:55.59 in the 200-yard fly, 22nd best time of 2:11.08 in the 200-yard breast, and her 21st ranked time of 4:12.05 in the 400-yard IM.
Aside from coaching his       No. 12 ranked Trojans, head coach Dave Salo was named USA Swimming’s national women’s head coach for the 2015 FINA World Championships. Salo, now in his ninth year as the Trojans men’s and women’s coach, will join U.S. men’s coach Dave Durden, who coaches the men’s team at Cal. The 2015 FINA World Championships will be held from Jul. 24 to   Aug. 9 in Kazan, Russia. Salo will be serving as the U.S. women’s head coach at the Worlds for the second time, as he coached the team in 2013 at the games in Barcelona.
In other national news, junior Kendyl Stewart was among five swimmers who were nominated for USA Swimming’s Breakout Performer of the Year at the 2014 Golden Goggles in November.  She earned the nomination after winning a bronze in the 100-meter fly and a silver in the 400-meter medley relay at the 2014 Pan Pacs.
She also won her first career U.S. titles with victories in the 50-meter and 100-meter fly at the 2014 U.S. Summer Nationals.
The swimming and diving meet against the Bears will be televised live on Pac-12 Networks beginning at 2 p.m. The diving portion of the meet will begin with 1-meter at 11:45 a.m. followed by 3-meter at 1 p.m. The meet against the Cardinal begins at noon.

Following a short two game road trip up to the Pacific Northwest, the USC Trojans (9-11, 1-6) will return home on Thursday night to take on the Colorado Buffaloes (10-9, 3-4).
Despite losing both games on the road to Oregon and Oregon State, the Trojans showed great effort and signs of improvement. Their lack of experience, however, cost them dearly in late-game situations.
The Trojans fell behind to Oregon but were able to battle back and tie the game before the Ducks went on a 9-0 run to put the game out of hand.
After battling back and forth with Oregon State, the Trojans were unable to close out the game. With less than 30 seconds left, the Trojans had a chance to tie the game.
Oregon State guard Gary Payton II stole the in bounds pass, however, and sealed the victory for the Beavers, who currently sit at third in the Pac-12.
USC has been getting steady production from starters Katin Reinhard and Nikola Jovanovic, but the lack of help off the bench has held back a strong starting unit.
In their two road games, the Trojans only got 21 points from their bench.
Head coach Andy Enfield admits that his team has been growing and improving as the season wears on and that he is hoping to pull out some close games in the future.
“Tonight, it went down to the last 30 seconds.” Anfield said after the 59-55 loss to Oregon State. “We’re getting better, but it’s frustrating when you don’t come out at the winning end.”
Colorado heads to Southern California coming off an impressive 90-58 win over the Washington State Huskies.
After winning their first two Pac-12 games, the Buffs lost four straight before defeating the Huskies last Saturday.
The Buffs have yet to win a game away from Colorado, going 0-6 this season; USC is currently 6-4 at home. Colorado defeated USC 86-65 back on Jan. 4, however.
USC has come a long way since that 20-point blowout, showing signs of a team that could develop into a possible Cinderella story, if luck goes their way. The Trojans have really only played one bad half of basketball against UCLA, where they were outscored by over 20 points in their last five games.
Aside from that game the Trojans have battled close with some of the top teams in the Pac-12, losing at the buzzer to Stanford and down the stretch to Oregon and Oregon State, while snatching up a win against Cal at home.
“I think we’re improving.” Enfield said. “However, we need to try to win some games.”
Enfield hopes USC will be able to finally get a win against a struggling Colorado team. If the Trojans hope to avenge their 20-point loss, they will need more consistent team scoring. As a team, the Trojans are shooting just over 40 percent from the field and 30 percent from the 3-point line.
Guards Jordan McLaughlin and Katin Reinhardt, along with forward Nikola Jovanovic currently lead the team in scoring but when one of them has an off night, USC struggles to get their offense going.
Since his return from an elbow injury two weeks ago, McLaughlin has really struggled to find his shot. In his four games after retuning, the freshman is shooting just 29 percent from the field including an icy 4-19 from downtown. McLaughlin has found other ways to help the Trojans, however, by leading the team in assists and steals per game.
While the Trojan offense has had its trouble, the defense has been fantastic over the past two games.
After being exposed by UCLA, the Trojans kept both Oregon and Oregon State under 40 percent shooting while forcing them into 21 turnovers combined.
The Trojans will need to keep their defensive intensity up and the offense will come around.
The Buffs are lead by senior guard Askia Booker, who sits fifth in scoring in the Pac-12 with 16.3 points per game, and sophomore forward Wesley Gordon, who averages 7.9 points and 7.7 rebounds per game.
In their previous meeting, the Buffs scorched the Trojans from beyond the 3-point arc, shooting above 50 percent and were able to get to the free throw line 19 times. The Trojans struggled to take care of the ball and gave up way too many open shots.
Enfield has gotten the best out of his defense lately and will have to hope they continue to keep their intensity at the same high level.
The Trojans and Buffs will tip off at the Galen Center on Thursday, Jan. 29 at 6:30 p.m. The game will be aired on FOX Sports 1.

I frequently tell my peers that “I’m thankful” for all of the things that I’ve been blessed with in my life — my family, friends, health and so on.
However, for Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, this two-word expression of gratitude was also his favorite defense mechanism when being forced to take questions from the media in a postgame press conference that followed his team victory over the Carolina Panthers in the NFC divisional playoff earlier this month.
This past Tuesday, Lynch returned to the media spotlight at the annual Super Bowl media day, a spotlight that he wants nothing do with.
And even before reporters even began to interrogate Lynch with their open-ended question, he made it clear to the media that he was only present so that he would not get fined.
In fact, Lynch’s response, “I’m here so I won’t get fined,” was just about the only one he gave to each of the credentialed media’s questions, as approximately 200 reporters surrounded his podium at the US Airways Center.
In his statement, Lynch was referring to an alleged fine of $500,000 that he faced from the NFL should he have failed to make himself available for media day, according to a league source.
NFL contracts obligate players to be available to the media, though the league cannot ultimately control what comes out of its players’ mouths.
Lynch is no stranger to fines imposed by the NFL, as the Skittles-loving running back has accumulated $120,000 in fines since the beginning of the regular season, the majority of them from violations of the league’s media policy.
During Wednesday’s media session, Lynch continued his shenanigans by uttering the phrase, “You know why I’m here,” approximately 14 times over a five-minute span.
His Super Bowl week comebacks add to a long resume of them that Lynch has built over the years, ranging from “thanks for asking,” to “I’m just about that action, boss,” to just a simple “yes”.
As entertaining as it is to watch, Lynch needs to stop acting like a child and put an end to his sassy behavior in front of reporters.
His rookie years are long gone, this being his eighth season in the league, so there is a really no excuse for this kind of conduct when dealing with professionals just like him who are simply trying to do their jobs.
If he wants people to call him “Beast Mode” for his performance on the field, he had better start acting as such off the field.
At the end of the day, it’s his responsibility to talk and make himself fully available to the media. When he goes up to the podium and pulls stunts such as the one we witnessed on 2015 Super Bowl Media Day, he makes a fool of not only himself, but also reporters, which is not ok.
By not directly answering any question or saying anything relevant for that matter, Lynch is also stripping the media of its right to get the answers they need to communicate to fans.
For years, the media has been an excellent vehicle for transmitting athlete’s feelings, input and personas. By not talking, Lynch is setting a bad example to younger athletes who look up to him — especially for college athletes who will soon be put into the same position as him.
From what I’ve experienced firsthand as a member of the media at USC, a lot of college athletes are being groomed on how to speak to reporters at a young age by requiring a lot of them to talk in postgame pressers. This likely translates to a comfortability when it comes time to do it in the pros. It seems as if Lynch, who attended Cal, never got any of that training.
If the five-time Pro Bowler’s demeanor was to spread to other athletes, it would jeopardize the entire landscape of sports media.
And it did indeed spread for a hot second when Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook pulled his best Lynch impersonation when he trolled the media by answering every question with a variation of, “We did a good job with execution.” Westbrook then proceeded to create an awkward moment by singling out one of the reporters and telling him that he simply didn’t like him.
Though Westbrook’s behavior is inexcusable, it does bring forth the argument that athletes sometimes are just not in the mood to stand in front of a bunch of reporters and answer their redundant questions, and therefore, they should should not be required to do so.
Yet, at the end of the day, these athletes need to fully read and understand their entire job description.
Yes, both Lynch and Westbrook are both getting paid millions of dollars a year to play their respective sports, but they are also required to appropriately represent their teams, fulfill their media obligations and serve as positive role models to the community. I’m not a sports agent, but I’m pretty sure a variation of those clauses are in their contracts somewhere.
So now hear me out Marshawn, you’re a highly paid professional being given the opportunity to promote your team, brand and personality on the world’s greatest stage, so don’t take any of it for granted.
I’m thankful to be able to watch you go all beast mode and pour Skittles out on the field on Sundays so the least you could do for the fans and my friends in the media is show them that  you’re genuinely thankful, too.

Please keep your personal bias out of this argument. As sports editor of a publication, obviously you want Lynch to speak; your career depends on it. He gets payed millions of dollars for playing football, not for speaking to the media. He brings the NFL and Seahawks millions of dollars of revenue because of the way he plays the game. Athletes are in no way obligated to express themselves to the media be it in the pros or college. Also, no need to bash CAL for not training. I’m sure he was trained but they can only do so much. Look at Josh Shaw this past year. Or Lendale White on Twitter. I’m sorry but It’s a shame this was even published.
Why do the reporters even bother asking him questions at this point? And most of the questions asked of players before/after games are the same questions they hear every week. I don’t even read or listen to press-conferences anymore because all the answers are the same every time. I personally don’t care what Lynch has to say about anything. I just want to watch some good football at the end of the day. If Lynch doesn’t like talking to the media that’s his deal.
Why are folks so concerned ab I UT what Lynch has tomsay. He’s there because he has to be, not because he wants to be there. He doesn’t like giving interviews. Why pressure him?  It’s a circus, and ya know what? The sports press have turned the Marshawn Lynch interview into a cir c us and a betting pool. You can be sure the reporters have side bets going on to see who can get Marshawn to state something other than the 1 phrase he has determined he will use  for that interview.

Remaining undefeated early in the regular season, the men’s volleyball team took down Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rival Long Beach State in straight sets Wednesday at the Galen Center.
The No. 2 Trojans (6-0, 5-0 MPSF) maintain their spot atop the conference standings and trail only defending national champions No. 1 Loyola-Chicago in the American Volleyball Coaches Association national poll.
The Trojans  took down the No.11 ranked 49ers by a final score of 25-17, 25-18, 25-19, and finished the match swinging just under 35 percent.
Senior middle blocker Robert Feathers led the team with eight kills, while redshirt sophomore  outside hitter Christopher Orenic added seven kills on the night and senior setter Micah Christenson orchestrated the attack with 27  assists. The team, which has put an emphasis on aggressive serving throughout the season, recorded six aces.
Senior Cristian Rivera got the start at opposite in place of junior opposite Josh Kirchner, who had started the last two matches.
USC began last weekend with a three-set win at UC San Diego by a score of 25-14, 25-16, 25-19 on Thursday, Jan. 22. The following night, USC pulled out a five-set win at UC Irvine by a score of 28-30,      25-17, 21-25, 25-23, 15-13.
Kirchner led the way against UC San Diego with 12 kills, then also led the team in kills against UC Irvine with 15. Rivera was recovering from a sprained ankle from earlier in the season.
Kirchner, who grew up in Sussex, Wisconsin, converted to an opposite after playing as a middle blocker most of his career.
He started 13 matches as a middle blocker his freshman year in 2013, appeared in only one match last year as a middle blocker, but should factor into the rotation much more at opposite this season.
In an interview with the Athletic Department after the UC Irvine win, Christenson said the team’s deep bench is a real strength of the team. He noted Kirchner as well as freshman outside hitter Larry Tuileta as key pieces to the team outside of the usual starting rotation.
“We’ve had some injuries,” Christenson said. “Tuileta came in and really swung strongly, and [Kirchner] replacing the injured [Rivera] didn’t miss a beat. It’s really nice knowing we have that team depth. There really is no step down, they can come in and raise the level.”
Tuileta recorded six kills off the bench against UC Irvine but did not make an appearance against Long Beach State.
Tuileta, a Honolulu native, is also a member of the football team.
In head coach Bill Ferguson’s weekly video recap with the Athletic Department, he likened the squad’s depth, resilience and team-oriented style of play to that of the San Antonio Spurs, the defending champions and            five-time winners of the NBA title.
“They understand the greater concept of team,” he said. “I’d like to think of us, if things are going well, like the San Antonio Spurs where sure everybody in the world knows who Tim Duncan is but by and large, their concept of team and ‘next guy up’ […] is what I think this team can be.”
While Rivera is the more experienced of the two at the position, having started at opposite frequently last season, Ferguson referred to the two as a “1a and 1b” at the position.
The Trojans will next host Cal State Northridge in another MPSF match on Friday Jan. 30 at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.
The match will feature the jersey retirements of former USC National Players of the Year Tom Duke (1988) and Bryan Ivie (1990, 1991).

Art walks, vegetables and excessive time in the Metro are three of my favorite things. When I learned that the arts district hosts a weekly Farmers’ Market, I instantly placed it on my must-visit list.
In Los Angeles, Thursdays are for art. The Downtown Art Walk occurs the second Thursday of every month and MOCA and LACMA offer discounts on Thursday evenings. Because of the popularity of these attractions and my limited knowledge of the Arts District, last week marked my first visit to the neighborhood.
Journeying to the district requires three Metro lines, good timing and ample hand sanitizer. Take the Expo Line to the Metro/7th Station, then the Purple Line to Union. From Union, the Gold Line stops right in the Arts District. Of course, a single bus ride can also transport you to the Arts District, but this is significantly less fun.
My friends and I were greeted by graffiti as soon as we entered. We whipped out our iPhones to document the very first piece of art we saw — a spray-painted heart with “Los Angeles” scrawled in the middle.
With one Instagram-worthy photo, I was satisfied with our trip – until Maya, our arts district expert, chastised, “We’re not even actually in the Arts District yet!”
Though some might prefer the ease of a museum setting, the Arts District forces visitors to thoroughly explore it’s surroundings, putting in effort to see art. This results in each mural or message feeling like an exciting discovery. We could’ve dedicated an entire day to meandering through alleys, but instead explored only briefly before visiting the Farmers’ Market.
The Farmers’ Market itself was smaller than we’d expected, an ordinary market within an extraordinary setting. Vendors sell a wide variety of products, ranging from local produce, to organic burgers and homemade sponges.
As I surveyed my surroundings, I recalled an article I’d read about gentrification in the Arts District, an article I’d forgotten about until I witnessed brand-new apartments alongside old industrial buildings. Farmers’ market patrons include young hipsters, while vendors are older, and could be overheard telling stories of the neighborhood’s past.
“There’s no middle-aged people here,” commented my friend Luke.
Similarly, there isn’t a clear middle ground between the new and the old in the Arts District.
Wedged between a sushi restaurant and an Umami Burger, the District Gallery provides space for residents to showcase their work. The gallery is run by the Los Angeles Arts District Space, a nonprofit that works to keep artists in the arts district.
One of LADAS’s founders, Jonathan Jerald, greeted me as soon as I entered the gallery. Without pause, he launched into the “short story” of the Arts District. In just 10 minutes, he recited the neighborhood’s entire history.
The district took off in the ’80s, when, according to Jerald, rent was as low as 25 cents a month. This created an entire neighborhood densely packed with artists who would mix studio space with living space.
“Since all the artists lived together in a close proximity, there was a synergy and they contributed to each others success,” explained Jerald.
Jerald would know — he has lived in the community since 1994 and experienced the rapid change firsthand. Housing isn’t 25 cents anymore; rent is rising as new businesses are thriving. In addition, the high-end international gallery, Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, recently announced the location of a new Arts District branch.
This isn’t a typical story of gentrification. Residents aren’t fleeing the developing neighborhood; rather, Jerald and other LADADS members are working to maintain the district’s original spark.
“Change is neither good or bad, you roll with it or get run over,” Jerald said.
And rolling with it is exactly what they’re doing. The nonprofit raised enough funds to start work on the Arts District Center for the Arts, which will include a theater and gallery space. The gallery I wandered into was a “demo” of this future space. Other LADADS programs include affordable housing workshops and an all-city mural project.
As we returned to the farmers’ market, I saw it differently — and not just because Jerald assured me that it is “twice as big” during the summer. Passionate and proud, the market’s participants clearly love their neighborhood. In the heart of a big city, they’ve somehow formed a community with a small-town feel.
Jerald’s interactions with community members proved this.
“These same old hippie chicks are always here,” he joked as we passed the live band.
The sense of community goes further than jokes; it’s shown by the members’ dedication to keeping not only themselves, but also other artists, in the neighborhood.
The farmers’ market exemplifies residents’ resilience and adaptability. They are adapting to the new crowd, but not without telling their own stories, which results in a space as full of art and history as the city’s best museums.

From Woodstock to Live Aid and Coachella to Lollapalooza, the festival craze has survived for generations. Chances are that most of you reading this have donned glittery face paint and braved epic weather conditions to swarm around in massive mosh pits at a music festival you saved for months to attend. But amid all the hype, how do festivals compare to small concerts?
“In high school, I used to go to tiny concerts like every week at small venues like the Troubadour because I enjoyed the intimacy between the audience and musicians. There’s like a connection between everyone in the room because it’s such a small crowd, and you know that everyone’s there for the music,” said Kristen Jan, a freshman majoring in business administration. “I feel like festivals are more for having a good time with your friends.”
This seems to be the consensus among music lovers. Small concerts play host to the truly passionate fans — look around the venue, and you’ll see lyrics tattooed on limbs and band shirts that are torn from wear. Small concerts allow for an intimacy that is missing at large festivals. (Plus, the truly hopeful stand a better chance of meeting band members after the gig, which is the first step in completing the marrying-a-band-member-fantasy everyone has.)
Without getting too sentimental, the small concert is for the music. It’s the music that made you stay holed up in your room for days listening to songs on repeat. It’s the music that caused you to fail your midterm because your mind was filled to the brim with lyrics. It’s the music that you’ve cried and danced to, and manically forced your friends to listen to. Small concerts are your chance to bring that soundtrack to life. If a small concert is done right, you don’t remember withwhom you went with or what you wore — all you remember is the way the music enveloped you in a rhythmic cocoon. Not to mention the fact that your wallet will probably thank you for choosing a $30 ticket over the cost of a festival multi-day pass, lodging, food, flower crowns and whatever drinks you end up consuming.
“I feel better supporting the people who can’t book huge gigs like music festivals. You get a lot more in touch with your local community and into your local arts scene,” said Hannah Cruz, a sophomore majoring in American studies and ethnicity, on why she prefers small concerts.
This isn’t to say that festivals don’t have their redeeming qualities as well. Large festivals are a whirlwind of wacky shenanigans permanently seared into your memory way after your grandchildren graduate college. Every band you’ve ever loved or just heard for 10 seconds on the radio is suddenly all in one place and ready to make you dance or sway.
Megan Elischer, a senior majoring in theater, has been to Coachella, EDC Orlando, EDC Las Vegas, Beyond Wonderland, Nocturnal Wonderland, Escape from Wonderland, all HARD events and various other electro festivals around L.A.
“Festivals are an immersive experience. The people create a vibe, you have more time to explore things and interact with people,” Elischer said. “I feel like I can form stronger bonds with people at festivals than I can during three hours at a show … It’s a great place to find new music. I like the idea of masses of people gathering for one big experience. I like seeing a sea of 30,000 people moving to the same beat,” she said. “I feel that’s something that’s very rare. I think that festivals provide a good opportunity to become music enthusiasts. You can see a band that you’ve never heard of and say ‘Oh OK, I think these guys are awesome. I’m going to start listening to them.’ In that way too, it provides an opportunity for people to expand their likes. They can get new tastes.”
And while festivals can be a huge payoff, they also come with consequences. Apart from the cost, there’s still the hours upon hours smashed up against thousands of other people who are just as sweaty as you are. You’ll meet some incredibly interesting souls, but unfortunately, you’ll also run into the inevitable pack of bros who drank way too much and are probably too wasted to legally walk.
For Cruz, it’s not just the upsides of small concerts but also the downsides of festivals that draw her away from the latter.
“Festivals have too much happening,” she said. “Too much spectacle, too many other things people focus on like drinking and partying, and it is too exhausting to focus on the music and appreciate as much. I always feel like I’m running around or my feet hurt or it’s too hot or I am hungry or thirsty or tired.”
But perhaps the worst part of a festival is the debilitating fear that you’re missing out on an even better performance at a different stage. With so many great bands on at the same time, you’ll always second-guess your choices.
There’s no right answer to the question of small concert or big festival; both offer their own advantages. It all boils down to what you want out of a concert. More into the experience and the atmosphere? Head over to Coachella, Lollapalooza or Glastonbury to meet new people and new bands. More interested in the music? Have a personal affair with your favorite band at an underground cafe or somewhere along the Sunset Strip. Either way, just promise that you’ll never give up on the dream of marrying the lead singer you’ve h
ad your eye on for years.

On Jan. 20, the Supreme Court took an unprecedented step in overruling a lower court in a death penalty case. In 1999, Mark Christeson was convicted of brutally murdering Susan Brouk and her two young children. He was then sentenced to death later that year. Death penalty experts who were brought in asserted that Christeson’s lawyers failed to adequately represent Christeson by missing the deadline to submit a federal appeal.
The lawyers refused to step down from the case and the lower courts refused the substitution. The Supreme Court was then forced to intervene, claiming that the lawyers had a conflict of interest and could not be expected to argue a case that could hurt their careers. Christeson’s new lawyer, Jennifer Merrigan, said, “There were serious constitutional errors in his trial and those have never been listened to.” Christeson’s lengthy and messy case exemplifies why the death penalty should be reviewed more carefully in the United States.
The death penalty, despite its long legacy, is a troubling and divisive topic for many citizens. Though the United States remains an adherent to the death penalty, according to a October 2014 Gallup poll, nationwide support for the death penalty is at a 40-year low. This is due to findings revealing the absence of absolute certainty in the trial process.
It is also clear that the United States has struggled to find the appropriate method to both ensure fair trials in death penalty cases and perform executions in ways deemed “humane.” Since 1976, 1,399 people have been executed in the United States, but there is no way of knowing how many of those executed were innocent because the courts do not usually entertain innocence claims after death. There are a few cases, however, with strong evidence pointing to innocence that have sparked controversy.
A key problem in prosecuting fair death penalty trials is eyewitness misidentification, which factored in 72 percent of wrongful convictions overturned by DNA evidence. In this way, improper or missing forensics is also a essential piece of evidence that can be used to convict innocent defendants. According to the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization that uses DNA evidence to overturn wrongful convictions, “In about 30 percent of DNA exoneration cases, innocent defendants made incriminating statements, delivered outright confessions or pled guilty.” These confessions are often the result of official misconduct by officials.
Pre-trial error exists even without mentioning possible trial error and executional problems. In Christeson’s case, the mistakes made by court-appointed lawyers in the appeals process may cost Christeson his life. Often times, court-appointed lawyers don not have much of a stake in the outcomes of their clients’ cases because of a lack of monetary incentive and a high volume of cases. The legal system is simply flooded with logistical and human errors. There is no doubt that death penalty cases have high stakes. If the death penalty is justified for serious, brutal crimes like murder, then the United States must ensure that it approaches the legal system fairly. The death penalty is undoubtedly cruel if it is not issued with extreme caution. Innocent, institutionalized execution cannot be tolerated in a so-called “humane” society. It is time for death penalty cases to be pursued with the presumption of innocence instead of the quest for conviction.
Interference by the Supreme Court in Christeson’s death penalty case is a step that affirms the importance of death penalty cases. Getting it wrong is no longer acceptable for our criminal justice system. All cases that involve the lives of American citizens should involve all the resources that this country has to offer.
It is imperative, for the sake of this nation’s integrity, that the American criminal justice system take further unprecedented action to prevent wrongful appropriation and execution of the death penalty.
Many, as Morgan, avoid the major innocents problem with the criminal justice system.
a) no clear case of an innocent executed, since the 1930’s.
b) from 14,000 – 28,000 additional innocents were murdered by those murderers that we allowed to murder, again, —  recidivist murderers — since 1973 (9) 
c) Every year, approximately 8000 known criminals, with criminal convictions. either released or never incarcerated, are allowed to murder (10)
d) up 200,000 innocents have been murdered by those known criminals we have released on parole and probation, while under government supervision, and/or, were otherwise released or were criminals never incarcerated, since 1973 (11).
e)  Studies by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 94 percent of state prisoners in 1991 had committed a violent crime or been incarcerated or on probation before. Of these prisoners, 45 percent had committed their latest crimes while free on probation or parole. When “supervised” on the streets, they inflicted at least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders and 11,600 rapes (more than half of the rapes against children) (12).
This is just for a review of prisoners for one year, only —   1991.
f) Patrick A. Langan, senior statistician at the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics, calculated that tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 may have reduced “violent crime by 10 to 15 percent below what it would have been,” thereby preventing a “conservatively estimated 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in 1989 alone.” (12).
In that one year alone!

Last week saw the end of the 10-year reign of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, who died at the age of 90. Despite the ostensible change in power, the monarchy in Saudi Arabia remains the same. That is to say, the status quo stays intact in the powerful Middle East nation.
Linyan Tian | Daily Trojan
King Salman, the 79-year-old newly anointed monarch, is a half-brother of the departed king and another son of the founder of the country. He is a member of the generation that has ruled the country for decades. The new crown prince, Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, is also the half-brother of King Abdullah, and it is not until the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, that Saudi Arabia will begin to see a potential generational shift in power.
The status quo in Saudi Arabia and the policies that reflect such an era of power will not change until the monarchy sees a new generation and a fresh outlook on power. Saudi Arabia plays a strategic role in the Middle East. As an oil powerhouse, the country boasts enormous wealth and influence in the global economy. The death of King Abdullah did result in a slight spike in crude oil prices. In the long term, however, oil prices should continue to stay low as demand weakens in Europe and Asia and production ramps up in Western countries such as the United States. King Salman’s reign should see much of the same. With an abundance of wealth, Saudi Arabia is able to provide for its people. Education, healthcare, housing, food and a myriad of other necessities are easily paid for by the monarchy. Such a system in which the government supports all aspects of life mitigates any threat of revolution in the country. During the Arab Spring in 2011, Saudi Arabia was immune to any protests in the streets or serious calls to revolution. With a dispatch of rounds of aid, Saudi Arabians had no justification to voice concern. Saudi Arabia will continue to experience such a resistance to change and a continuity of authoritarianism under King Salman.
It’s not only the regional economy and political organization that will continue in this regime. Women’s rights, the distribution of wealth and treatment of minorities will only change with a parallel change in generation. The ancient regime in Saudi Arabia will continue to prevail with a policy of appeasement toward the people.
Many wonder when Saudi Arabia will transition to a more democratic form of government. It is unclear when it will begin to respect basic human rights or when women will gain a seat at the table in terms of civic involvement, or even when those not part of the royal family receive equal opportunity and a voice to express discontent. Surely the reign of King Salman will not begin to bring about transformational change.
Saudi Arabia has always represented an apprehension to change and an affinity for tradition in a region deeply rooted in its tempered past. True change in the country, if and when it arrives, will fundamentally alter the diplomatic dynamics of the Middle East in terms of geopolitical axioms and relations both within and outside the region.
A generational change is the only opportunity for change for the absolute monarchy. Time will tell if the deputy crown prince will take the throne and begin the brew of change.
The status quo will reign supreme until then, but in the meantime, Saudi Arabia will cling to continuity as a source of stability.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate convened Tuesday night at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to discuss the status of on-campus concerts this semester. The meeting included presentations by USG assemblies and committees that explored past and future events.
The Concerts Committee is in charge of organizing signature concerts such as the annual Welcome Back, Conquest and Spring Fest. Tuesday’s Senate meeting recapped Concert Committee’s fall semester events. Some of these events included hosting several music industry mixers, bringing BMG Publishing Group for a talk and giving away concert tickets to students through scavenger hunts around campus. The committee also delineated this semester’s upcoming events: an Anti-Gun Violence Concert, four Noontime Shows with bands such as Moons on Mars, Meets and Greets through Def Jam,  as well as several music industry panels.
During the meeting, directors from the Concerts Committee expressed the upcoming challenges for Spring Fest, such as obtaining funding for larger acts.
“I think it would take a lot of effort to raise awareness in the student body that we do not have funding for these huge artists,” said Abigail Harris, assistant director of Concerts Committee. “A lot of people assume that USC has a lot of money, but a lot of it doesn’t go to concerts. But that’s the administration’s policy.”
Kirsten Lee, assistant director of Concerts Committee discussed plausible decreases in budget for spring concert events.
“I think that the next step to increase our working budget would probably be to charge for guest tickets,” Lee said. “Through the budget we get in student fees, we won’t have large acts anytime soon.”
“I actually think that over the past couple of years, the acts have become better than they have been in the past,” said Ryan Hamilton, director of Concerts Committee. “Long ago we were more reliant on booking acts that we thought would blow up at some point and a lot of times we were successful in doing so but students didn’t necessarily know these artists at the time. Over the past three years, we’ve been able to bring a lot more acts that students want to see, but we still have a long way to go in terms of getting the really big names,” Hamilton said.
Lee discussed difficulties in coordinating a diverse music performance.
“It’s a hard fight because there are so many students at this school, and everyone’s got a different music taste,” Lee said. “It’s really hard to appease everyone. In the end, it comes down to what we think is right. Sometimes we have to choose to piece certain groups at some shows and certain groups at others. We’re never going to able to make everyone happy.”
Various student organizations also presented at the USG Senate meeting. The Political Student Assembly discussed their desire to bring Beau Willimon, creative director of House of Cards, for a talk on campus. Trojan Pride also shared ideas for future activities they envision. These include broomball, bubble bowl and wheelchair basketball.
Furthermore, Latino Student Assembly Executive Director Eric Ochoa recapped 15 events that occurred during the fall semester. Ochoa outlined upcoming Latino Student Assembly events, which include a performance discussing hyper-masculinity in society, a speaker event analyzing the negative side effects of a culture of accomplishment found in elite universities and an event for genocide awareness month in April.
“We’re hoping to get survivors from different genocides to raise awareness about these things happening in the world,” Ochoa said. “As everyone knows, human rights are a big issue around the world.”

Neuroscientists at the Keck School of Medicine of USC may have revealed a new method to detect early onset Alzheimer’s disease by using brain scans to indicate abnormalities in blood vessels.
By using high resolution imaging of the brain, USC researchers have found evidence to prove that older age offsets a more permeable blood-brain barrier, which may lead to various negative effects in the hippocampus.
The study also suggested using brain scans to detect changes that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s in the blood vessels of the hippocampus. Early detection may prove to be pivotal in determining disease progression and quality of life since it could slow the loss of memory, cognition and learning.
These findings may carry important developments in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s on a large scale since the brain disease affects around 5.2 million people in the United States. Alzheimer’s is the most common degenerative disease, yet, reasons why damages to memories, thought process and behavior occur are still largely unclear.
Dr. Berislav Zlokovic, the director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, currently leads the project. Zlokovic is a recognized leader in Alzheimer’s disease and stroke research, and has published more than 250 articles on the subject.
“My colleagues and I developed an assay that can scan all small regions of the brain; that was an advanced approach,” Zlokovic said. “We were able to screen throughout the entire brain and see changes in different brain regions.”
Zlokovic explained how they scanned a patient’s brain after intravenously injecting the patient with tracer molecules. The researchers would then take profiles of the arteries that provide supplies to the brain and measure the tracer concentration.
“Relating the concentration in the brain and concentration in blood could then quantitatively indicate if the results were normal or if the results meant leakage,” Zlokovic said.
The blood-brain barrier had more permeability in the hippocampus for patients with dementia, in comparison to those without the disease. Individuals who have mild dementia also had 30 percent more albumin, a blood protein, in their cerebrospinal fluid, which further emphasized a leaky blood-brain barrier. In total, the study contained 64 human subjects who were recruited by the USC Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.
The research involved collaboration among multiple departments within USC as well as outside USC like the Huntington Medical Research Institute. Funding have consisted of grants from the Zilkha Institute and various institutes within the National Institutes of Health  as well as support from other investigators
Zlokovic’s discussed the details regarding the framework for his research.
“We are trying to apply this assay for people who are cognitively normal without dementia but have the genetic risk to develop Alzheimer’s disease,” Zlokovic explained.
“The interest exists for specifically two groups of people: people with sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease, meaning they have the genes for late onset Alzheimer’s that may or may not have presented symptoms, and familial Alzheimer’s Disease, meaning they have early onset Alzheimer’s that began at an unusually young age,” Zlokovic said.
Zlokovic hopes that his findings will help detect Alzheimer’s disease very early on in, order to maximize the effectiveness of treatments and allow more research opportunities to further understanding of the disease.
Fahvyon Jimenez, a junior majoring in business, has been a student worker at the Zilkha Institute for three years. Though he is not involved in the research lab itself, he expressed confidence about the direction the project will take in the future.
[Dr. Zlokovic’s] lab is one of the most confident labs here. The hippocampus is super important as it is very much responsible for reorganizing thoughts we have throughout the day and transferring short term memory into long term memory,” Jimenez said, “The researchers are incredibly talented and shockingly charismatic. Everyone is energetic and excited about what they do.”

Samantha Turner, a senior majoring in English, will trade planes and cars to bike cross country this summer.
Turner will be biking to raise awareness about cancer, but is not the first time she will take part in such an event as she ran across the country from San Francisco to Baltimore in 2013. She will be biking with the 4K for Cancer, an organization that raises money for the Ulman Cancer fund in Baltimore, Maryland. For every dollar that each participant raises, the 4K Cancer Fund donates 90 cents to a young person affected by cancer.
Turner explained that she was motivated to become part of 4K for Cancer by the cancer patients.
“I just really want to be part of the cure. I just think it’s so unfair,” she said. “With cancer, you are so helpless. There really is nowhere to turn. Your entire life falls in the hands of doctors.”
When Turner ran the across the United States, she ran with a group of 21 college students from all over the country. It took her and her teammates 30 days. This time around, she expects that the bike trip will take 70 days.
Turner explained that though it may seem counterintuitive that biking will take longer than running, it is because of the way in which the two are carried out.
“When we ran, we were separated into two vans of 15 people. The van would then drop two people off every two miles. When the van was finished dropping off the last pair, it would go back and pick up the people that were first dropped off.”
The states her team ran through in 2013 were California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Idaho, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.
“It was an incredible experience,” Turner said. “Since we were not allowed on highways, we usually took back roads and I was able to see parts of the United States that very few people have actually seen.”
This year, Turner will be biking from Baltimore, Maryland to Portland, Oregon.
Along the way, they will stop by “hope houses,” where cancer patients receive treatment if the nearest hospital is too far away.
“It was very emotional stopping by hope houses because you see people receiving chemotherapy which is extremely harsh on the body.”
In doing so, they also hope to raise awareness as they conduct their trip.
“In order for the 90 cents of every dollar we raise to be allocated to a young person affected by cancer, we don’t sleep in hotels,” Turner said. “We don’t pay for housing so we stay in places like churches or high school gyms.”
The group will do some sightseeing if they finish their miles early, but oftentimes they aren’t left with extra time.
“We usually woke up at 4:30 in the morning, so we could start running by 5:30 to avoid the heat,” Turner said. “The earliest the team finished was 12 p.m., but if the team was taking a while to run, we could be done until 5 p.m.”
Turner said that the hardest part of the trip was being separated from her family and friends. It was even more difficult when she did not have cellphone service and wanted to share something special about the trip with her family.
Nonetheless, Turner described her trip as being incredible.
“I met some of the best people in the entire world. They were people willing to sacrifice so much for others,” Turner said. “Each of them had a relation to cancer, a family member that they cared about and it was just amazing to meet so many people care for someone other than themselves.”
Turner said that her main motivation for competing is to let the young patients know she supports them.
“This year, I am dedicating my trip to them,” Turner said. “My only wish is for these people to know that somebody cares about them. If I were in their position, I would want someone to do the same.”
So far, Turner has been the only Trojan to participate in 4K for Cancer.
“It would be amazing to see other people from USC to take part, even if it’s alumni.”
Turner said that her main goal is to raise awareness about the cancer community.
“I just want to tell people about my story, of what I am doing, to give back to the cancer community. I am an incredibly lucky person and it’s just part of being human to just give back,” she said.

Recently, the Shoah Foundation selected 25 teachers to take part in a four-day professional development program in Poland. Staff members from the foundation instructed teachers on how to use the institute’s Visual History Archive, a collection of more than 53,000 audiovisual recounts of experiences during the Holocaust and other genocides.
The foundation partnered with the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, Discovery Education and the World Jewish Congress on the program, called Auschwitz: The Past is Present.
The program supported observance of Auschwitz’s liberation anniversary. The “Past is Present” focuses on discovering a generation of teachers and students who will learn to engage in the study and remembrance of the Holocaust.
International Holocaust Remembrance Day marks the passage of 70 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, a network of concentration camps built and operated in occupied Poland by Nazi Germany during World War II. The camp was the site of the murders of more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, between 1942 and late 1944.
On Tuesday, more than 100 survivors and their liberators attended the commemoration.Director Steven Spielberg, who founded the Shoah Foundation in 1994, was also in attendance.
Participating teachers were selected to work on the program through a worldwide contest held by Discovery Education and the Shoah Foundation.
Fifteen teachers were from the U.S. and 10 were from countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Rwanda. Twelve junior interns were also selected to participate in the program in Poland.
In a statement released by USC News, one history and language arts teacher at Turning Point Academy in Emporia, Kansas, addressed how the professional development program in Poland would help in teaching her students about the Holocaust.
“Students must understand how hate and intolerance led to near annihilation of an entire ethnic group,” Barbara Fowler, a history and language arts teacher from Kansas who was among the 25 teachers selected to go on the trip, said. “This visit will allow me to guide my students as they seek to understand the perspective of all those involved including victims, perpetrators, collaborators, bystanders and rescuers.”
Those participating in the trip to Poland visited the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, participated in workshops with first-hand testimonies and attended a reception with Holocaust survivors as well as the 70th anniversary commemoration. According to the Shoah Foundation, the trip aimed to enhance both educators’ and students’ understanding of the Holocaust and the significance of preserving Auschwitz.
The survivors hope their story will not be forgotten and will be passed on for many generations to come.
“Those who lived through the Holocaust have carried the burden of remembering long enough,” said USC Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen Smith in a statement to USC News. “It’s up to us now, their children and grandchildren, to lift its heavy weight off their shoulders. We are ready to take on the responsibility of ensuring that this tragic chapter of human history is never repeated.”

The Women of Troy welcomed highly regarded midfielder Morgan Andrews from long-time rival Notre Dame this past Thursday.
After playing her freshman and sophomore seasons with the Fighting Irish and leading the team in scoring both years, Andrews will have have two years of eligibility remaining with USC.
The addition of Andrews is a huge pick-up for second-year head coach Keidane McAlphine, who is ecstatic about the acquisition of Andrews.
“We are excited to get such an extremely talented player to add to our roster,” McAlphine said. “Through this process, I have been equally as impressed with her as a person. This is a win for the Trojans, but also a win for the   Pac-12.”
In 2014, Andrews started all 22 games for Notre Dame and led the team in points for the second consecutive season after netting six goals to go with five assists on her way to a second-team All-ACC selection.
This stellar performance comes after her standout freshman season when she tallied a team-high 19 points, catapulting her to be named to multiple all-freshman teams and the ACC Freshman of the Year.
She also played a key role in propelling the Irish to a third-round NCAA Tournament appearance.
McAlphine is likely hoping that Andrews can help do the same at USC after the Women of Troy fell in the first round of last year’s tournament to Pepperdine in heartbreaking fashion, losing in penalty kicks.
Andrews also brings years of U.S. national team experience, having played with U.S. soccer since she was just 14 years old. She was a notable member of the the American squad that won the CONCACAF U-20 Championship.
The two-time Gatorade National High School Player of the Year should prove to be a tremendous asset on the field for a team that is looking to build on its success from last year.
After holding a 12-6-3 record during the regular season in McAlphine’s first year as head coach in 2014, USC clinched its first tournament appearance since 2010 and the program is hoping to reach even greater heights in its 2015 campaign.

Though it seems the offseason just began, college football analysts have already begun making predictions for the 2015 season. Among those early predictions is a list of breakout players to watch in 2015, which takes input from coaches, recruiting evaluations and ESPN.com college football analysts. Atop the list is USC freshman cornerback and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson.
Jackson demonstrated his duality during the 2014 season, executing key plays on both sides of the ball. Jackson put up 50 tackles at corner and made stylish plays on offense to ignite the Trojans’ scoring drives. One such play was a 71-yard touchdown catch in the Trojans’ bowl game victory over Nebraska.
Jackson also performed on special teams, returning a kick 98 yards for a score against the Huskers in the Holiday Bowl.
Jackson is just one of the underclassmen who shined in 2014. Offensively, freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith had five touchdowns on 54 receptions in 2014. Smith was the No. 2 receiver behind junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor, but will likely assume Agholor’s position in his absence. Redshirt junior wide receiver George Farmer also opted for the NFL draft, leaving Jackson with plenty of room to establish an even more dominant offensive presence.
On defense, Jackson is joined by safety Su’a Cravens, who had five sacks and three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown.
Quarterback Cody Kessler will return for his senior season, leading a predominantly young Trojan squad.
Jackson turned heads with a leaping flip into the endzone in the Holiday Bowl and will take his talent for jumping to the track and field team this spring. Jackson will be competing in the long jump and sprints for USC.

It’s one of the best names of all-time in the sports world. It looks like it should be pronounced “crazy-zoo-ski,” yet it somehow comes out to “shi-shef-ski.”
But Mike Krzyzewski will be remembered as one of the great names in sports for more than just its crazy spelling; that became abundantly clear this week. The legendary college basketball coach became the first to win 1,000 games as a head coach in men’s Division I basketball this past Sunday when his Duke Blue Devils defeated St. John’s.
Krzyzewski had already claimed the record for most all-time wins — surpassing his former head coach from his playing days, Bob Knight — a couple of years ago with 903. However, the new milestone is almost as noteworthy. Throw in four national championships at Duke and two gold medals as the U.S. men’s national team coach and you have one of the greatest — arguably the best — basketball coaches in the history of the sport.
However, the coach dominating most of the headlines in sports recently hasn’t been Krzyzewski. It’s a different head coach with a chance to add to his legacy with one more big win, only he is in danger of being remembered for all the wrong reasons.
As fellow Daily Trojan columnist Regan Estes noted yesterday, the sports media coverage of Deflate-gate has been so overblown that it’s almost not worth talking about anymore. More details are sure to come out about it before the Super Bowl this weekend, it should come up a couple times during the actual game and it will likely still be a topic of discussion this offseason.
What matters is this: 11 of the 12 balls used by the New England Patriots during the AFC championship game were confiscated at halftime by the NFL, the balls were determined to have air pressure lower than the league mandated minimum and FOX Sports reported yesterday that there is video of a Patriots staffer taking balls from the referees’ locker room into a separate room instead of directly onto the field before the game.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick has been at the heart of the controversy. He and Patriots owner Robert Kraft denied any knowledge of the incident, and it could be a big coincidence. But not only is this the only time something like this has happened to an NFL team, but it also just so happened to occur to the team busted by the NFL for illegally videotaping opponents in 2007, leaving even Boston sportswriters to doubt that this could all be random.
Was it the difference between winning and losing for the Patriots? Almost certainly not. The ESPN “Sports Science” program broke down data on an underinflated ball’s improved grip and called the difference “miniscule.” But that’s not the point.
The point is that if the Patriots did do that on purpose, they’ve created a meaningless media firestorm that must be distracting them as they prepare for the Super Bowl. If they win, the title will certainly come with an asterisk. The trick could even result in a penalty from the NFL, though I doubt it would be anything significant and highly doubt it would come out before the big game.
Overall, the incident is just a big downer for the country’s biggest single sports event. It’s everything we don’t and shouldn’t like about sports.
And I’m not going to really root for the Seattle Seahawks in spite of New England. Maybe this makes me an ungrateful USC fan, but I don’t love Seattle head coach Pete Carroll as much as I did when he was the head coach here. Like Belichick, Carroll won several championships for the Trojans and the program he built here brings words like “dynasty” to mind, but his legacy at the school will always be tarnished to some degree by a cheating scandal.
I absolutely adored Carroll while growing up. I honestly might not be studying at this university if it wasn’t for him. But I’m still disappointed that he chose to go back to the NFL just before the NCAA sanction storm hit, and I probably always will be unless he comes back to coach here again.
Honestly, I’m probably not even going to watch the Super Bowl. It’s a fantastic heavy-weight matchup, but there’s no underdog and I have no real interest in what the result is. The men’s club lacrosse team also has its quasi-Super Bowl this Saturday when we make the trip up to visit the mighty UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, so Sunday will be homework day.
That’s what makes the timing of Coach K’s milestone so great. I don’t want to hear anymore about Deflate-gate and you probably don’t want to hear anymore about Deflate-gate either, so let’s look at what truly is a great, feel-good sports story.
What I love about Coach K isn’t from any real personal connection to Duke — I do have a cousin who went there — but because he just does things the right way. There’s no point-shaving, institutional oversight or even a real recruiting violation on his record. The closest he’s come to a violation was being investigated for having a phone call with a recruit after the recruit finished a summer tournament but before the recruit had arrived home from it, a rule which ESPN’s Dana O’Neil described as “simply inane.”
Beyond just rule following, his priorities seem to be in the right place as well. He’s known for recruiting players he knows are more likely to stay in school all four years and graduate on time instead of players waiting one year to declare for the NBA draft. In an age where recruiting violations and “one-and-dones” seem to be the norm, it’s amazing he can still have so much success year after year without any “everybody else was doing it” excuses. To then replicate that success with the national team, where instead of working with amateurs, he’s responsible for managing the biggest superstars and biggest egos in the whole sport, shows that he’s really on the next level when compared to other college coaches of similar stature.
The No. 4 Blue Devils take on undefeated ACC rival No. 2 Virginia on Saturday. Maybe I’ll record it and watch that on Sunday instead.

During their time at USC, student-athletes are taught the importance of determination and of giving back to the community.
Former men’s tennis team captain Michael Grant seems to have truly taken those lessons to heart. London-born Grant, who graduated from USC in 2014 as a three-time national champion, is now putting his efforts into a fundraising campaign for children in Zimbabwe.
Grant is raising money for Hoops 4 Hope, a nonprofit organization that uses sports to ease racial conflict, promote a healthy living and teach teamwork as well as life skills to children.
Though Grant excels at tennis — achieving 20-6 as a starter for the Trojans during his senior year and playing professionally upon graduation — his decision to support this basketball program was an easy one.
“My friend who is a basketball player at Hamilton was quite involved, and with my dad growing up in Zimbabwe, we have always tried to help,” Grant said. “They are losing financial support and are struggling to keep operations going beyond a few months in advance. I went to play two pro tournaments in Zimbabwe and visited the program, and to see how much the kids are in need and what the program does for them, urged me to try and raise money for them.”
Grant and his friend, Peter Kazickas, started their Indiegogo fundraising campaign on Dec. 21, 2014. Contributions of any amount are accepted, but certain amounts offer perks to contributors. For donating $20, they receive a Hoops 4 Hope patch, trading card and post card. For donating $100, contributors receive a watch with the inscription “Ubuntu” on it, which is the African concept of essential human virtues: compassion and humanity.
In the spirit of the sports program, there are sneakers signed by celebrities up for grabs. For donating $500, patrons can claim sneakers signed by actress Sarah Jessica Parker. The perk for donating $1,000 is a pair of sneakers signed by 2008 NBA Finals MVP and current Washington Wizards forward Paul Pierce, and the perk for donating $1,500 is a pair of Air Jordans designed by current free agent and two-time NBA champion Ray Allen.
These perks have proven to be useful incentive — as of Jan. 27 the campaign had raised $8,830 of its $50,000 goal.
Grant explained how the funds, which will go toward programming, equipment, uniforms, transportation, court maintenance, water, power, Internet and security, are instrumental in helping the children of Zimbabwe.
“It’s fun for them, they love to compete as well,” Grant said. “It’s a great way to keep the kids off the streets and occupied. Often times they don’t have running water or electricity, so to give them an outlet five days a week after school is great for them. It gives them hope not just on the court with basketball, but changes their lives with the life skills they are taught.”
The fundraiser runs until Feb. 19, and donations can be made on the Hoops 4 Hope Indiegogo page.

After two road wins — a sweep over UC San Diego and five-set brawl against UC Irvine — the No. 2 undefeated Trojans (5-0, 4-0 MPSF) look to continue their dominance at home against No. 11 Long Beach State (5-2, 2-2 MPSF).
Since then, the Trojans have surged up the rankings from No. 5 to No. 2. If the Trojans continue to play at such a high level, they will be in serious contention for the NCAA title when the tournament comes around in May. USC is one of two undefeated ranked teams: Loyola-Chicago, the 2014 defending national champion, holds the No. 1 spot.
For tonight’s match, the Trojans come in with all of the momentum. The grueling win over then-No. 3 UC Irvine emphasized the true strength and talent of this Trojans roster.
The balanced offensive attack anchored by senior setter Micah Christenson has proved nearly unstoppable for opponents. As a captain, Christenson’s awareness and natural leadership skills have created a dynamic, relentless attack.
Led by junior opposite Josh Kirchner, redshirt sophomore outside hitter Christopher Orenic and middle blocker Robert Feathers, the Trojans control the net. Feathers currently leads the MPSF in hitting percentage at .507. When Kirchner, Orenic and Feathers all get into a rhythm, the Trojans dominate play.
Kirchner has shined in the last three matches for the Trojans, starting the last two. Kirchner tied the team-high of nine kills against Stanford and recorded a team-high of 12 and 15 kills against UC San Diego and UC Irvine, respectively. His play has transitioned him into a key role in USC’s offense. His seamless transition into the starting six for the Trojans showcases the team’s depth. There is no step down when pulling players from the bench, adding multiple layers.
USC continues to dominate from the service line, recording five aces in each of their last two matches.
Not only is this team deeply talented, but they are also incredibly close. Their togetherness has translated to cohesive execution on the court. Specifically with regard to their hard-fought win over the Anteaters, Christenson noted that the win really highlighted the team’s “grit.” To put the intensity of the match in perspective, the Trojans came back from a 7-2 deficient in the fifth set.
“It shows a lot of the toughness and camaraderie of our team,” Christenson said.
For Long Beach, outside hitter Dan Glamack and middle blockers Taylor Gregory and Bryce Yould fuel the offense. Libero Ryan Windisch mans the back line and averages 3.09 digs per set — he is second in the MPSF and third in the country. The 49ers will put up a fight but if the Trojans can both silence Glamack, Gregory and Yould as well as target their shots away from Windisch, USC should come away from the match with a third consecutive home victory.
In MPSF play, the 49ers beat Stanford and UC San Diego and lost to Pepperdine and UC Irvine; their most recent match was a loss to No. 5 Pepperdine.
The Trojans battle the 49ers tonight at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.
