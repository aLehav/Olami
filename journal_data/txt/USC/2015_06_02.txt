When Sunday morning rolls around and you finally decide to pull your lazy butt out of bed, what do you want? A cup of coffee and food. And some good food at that. The only problem is that you are too lazy to get dressed and you know you shouldn’t spend more money on mediocre food from LA Cafe and overpriced eggs at Urth Caffe. So you decide to pull out the Cheerios. Wrong! Instead, pull out your apron and prepare yourself to make some culinary magic in the comfort of your own home.
An ideal brunch has to not only fill your belly, but must also satisfy your sweet and salty cravings. On the savory side, eggs provide essential protein and bacon gives the necessary crispiness and fat. And to satisfy your sweet tooth, what’s better than a nice smoothie or some caramelized apples (it’s a fruit, so it’s healthy) on top of crunchy vanilla french toast? Yum. Get ready to indulge in some delicious and easy recipes that will liven up your weekend brunch.
Fried Egg Sandwich · Delaney Brockman | Daily Trojan
Fried Egg Sandwich
Total time: 15 minutes
Serves one
Ingredients:
-1 bagel
-2 slices cheddar cheese
-2-3 strips thick-cut bacon
-1 tablespoon butter
-2 eggs
Instructions:
1. Take the bacon out of the fridge and let it sit for at least 10 minutes. Bacon cooks better when it starts at room temperature (so make yourself some coffee in the meantime).
2. When you can’t wait any longer for your bacon to warm up, arrange it in a cold skillet. Cook bacon over medium-low heat, turning often. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan, otherwise your bacon will be floppy rather than crispy. For crispy, but not over crispy bacon, watch it carefully to see that the fat is slightly browned, then remove the bacon to let it rest.
3. While the bacon is cooking, lightly toast the bagel in a toaster.
4. Set your oven to broil. Butter the toasted bagel and place a slice of cheese on each side. Put it in the oven for two minutes, until the cheese starts to bubble.
5. Use the same skillet you cooked the bacon in for the eggs, so they can simmer in the bacon’s juiciness. Make sure the skillet is at medium heat; crack the egg in the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Watch for the egg whites to become opaque, then flip the eggs. Wait 20 seconds and remove.
6. Stack the bacon and eggs on the bottom bagel half, put on the top half of the bagel, bite into the delicious sandwich and enjoy.
Blueberry Green Tea Smoothie
Total time: 10 minutes
Serves one
Ingredients:
-100 grams (about 2 large handfuls) frozen blueberries
-75 grams frozen banana (about ¾ a banana)
-1 green tea bag
-1 teaspoon honey
-Small handful of ice
-¾ cup unsweetened almond milk
-Fresh blueberries, raspberries and blackberries for topping
Instructions:
1. The night before, place blueberries and a banana in the freezer. Then brew 4 tablespoons of green tea and place it in the fridge to cool.
2. The next morning, put all the ingredients, except ice and fresh fruit, in your blender. Blend. Taste. Add ice, if necessary, to thicken the smoothie.
3. Pour the smoothie in a mason jar. Top with fresh fruit. Take a picture for Instagram.
Eggs & Avocados
Total time: 15 minutes
Serves one
Ingredients:
-1 avocado
-2 eggs
-Salt and pepper
Instructions:
1. Set the oven to 425 F. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Make the resulting holes larger (I take out about a large spoonful so the egg will fit). Put the eggs in the holes and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
2. Place both avocado halves on a baking sheet and pop them into the oven for 15-25 minutes. If you like a runny yoke keep them in for 15 minutes; if you like your eggs harder, keep them in for 25 minutes.
3. Other than having it plain, the avocado is also good with a little lime, some chili powder and a small corn tortilla to sop up the yoke.
Chia Almond Sourdough French Toast with Honey Caramelized Apples · Delaney Brockman | Daily Trojan
Chia Almond Sourdough French Toast with Honey Caramelized Apples
Total time: 20 minutes
Serves two
Ingredients:
-½ thin loaf of two-day-old sourdough
-¾ teaspoon chia seeds (flax works as well)
-2 tablespoons coconut flour
-½ cup vanilla almond milk
-1 teaspoon coconut oil
-1 apple
-1 tablespoon butter
-1 ½ tablespoon brown sugar
-1 tablespoon lemon juice
-1 ½ tablespoon honey
Instructions:
1. Grind chia seeds in a blender. Then mix ground seeds and flour. Slowly mix the milk and dry mix; if you add the milk too quickly, the mixture will become lumpy. Let the mixture sit for at least 15 minutes. Cut loaf into 1-inch slices.
2. While you wait for the mixture, cut the apple into 10 slices. Melt 1 tablespoon butter and 1 ½ tablespoons brown sugar in a separate pan over medium heat. Wait for the mixture to become bubbly, then add the apples. Constantly toss the apples, cooking them for 7-10 minutes. If you like honey, at the 5-minute mark, drizzle the honey over the apples and cook for the remaining minutes. The apples should be soft enough so a fork can easily go through the apple. Remove from heat.
3. Whisk the mixture after 15 minutes. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add some coconut oil. You can also use butter, but I find that coconut oil works better because it doesn’t cook off as quickly, plus it adds a little extra kick to your toast. Soak bread in the mixture, dipping each side. When the pan is hot throw the slices into the pan. Cook each side, turning every 30 seconds until they are golden brown. Then plate them.
4. Drizzle the apples and sugar mixture over your french toast and dig in!

Skimming through the Yelp reviews for Beer Belly, a gastropub in Koreatown, a person can find some truly unique experiences from guests who are nearby. Waitresses who tip themselves extra without telling customers, drunken arguments between staff members and saucy, unapologetic owners — these are just some of the allegations that one can read about skimming through the reviews that give lower rankings. But, the establishment in total has four out of five stars on the site, leaving its true quality up for determination.
Beer Belly is a well-hidden restaurant located on the crossroads of 6th Street and Western Avenue, snugly tucked behind the I Love Boba that dominates the storefront. Metered parking is available on the streets or in the adjacent lot.
The restaurant serves a fine selection of craft beers that changes according to seasonal availability as well as an experimental menu that includes such fare as duck fat fries, pork belly chips, deep-fried Oreos and the infamous “Death by Duck,” duck fat fries sprinkled with duck skin cracklins and duck confit.
The unique menu is the brainchild of Beer Belly’s Philly-raised head chef Wes Lieberher, a former musician who quit the scene after developing tinnitus (ringing in the ears) but not before nearly throwing himself off a building in a hallucinatory state following three weeks of constant ringing in his ears. On his personal website, Lieberher credits cooking with saving his life and helping him detach from the music scene.
Lieberher’s carefree rock background is evident in the calorie count of many of the items on the menu — in the dessert section, four out of five menu options are deep fried.
Upon arrival, it is impossible not to notice the colorful street art that covers the building – a rainbow explosion of swirls that wrap around the kitchen and into the outdoor eating area. Large signs labeled “DRINK” and “PARK” stand as humorous directional guides for patrons.
The actual restaurant,  however, is much more conservatively laid out, with the most color coming from the hostess who rocked a multi-colored hairstyle and had the bubbly personality and high-pitched tone of Cyndi Lauper.
The patrons, whom Yelp reviewers mostly referred to as “hipster,” actually appear to be a diverse range of characters — from edgy fashionistas to preppies to elderly couples.
The bartenders are friendly and personable, eager to share their knowledge of craft beers and suggestions for food. The service in general was quick, efficient and polite. Unlike the punk rock, anti-establishment aesthetic painted by some Yelp reviewers, the service was pretty much what could be expected from a well-reviewed restaurant.
One of the most popular items at Beer Belly is the Beer Belly Grilled Cheese, described as a quad-deck 4×4 of cheddar, Asiago, Gruyere, goat cheese and applewood-smoked bacon drizzled in maple syrup. The sandwich costs a hefty $12 but proves to be a filling item to the point that a patron might fall into a food coma if not careful.
The sandwich arrived within 10 minutes on a wooden serving platter and appeared to be incredibly small and reeking of maple syrup; however, upon the first bite it proved to be more than initially met the eye. The bread was flaky and sweet, like a real French croissant, and made a delicious crunch. The saltiness of the bacon somehow mixes perfectly with the sweet taste of the syrup, which recalls a memory of a teacher who once said, “You don’t mix sweet and meat.” Beer Belly has definitely proven that wrong.
Beer Belly is not known for its health-conscious offerings, however, and it’s only a matter of time before the heaviness associated with unhealthy food sinks in. Patrons less accustomed to such substantial fare might find themselves forcing down the second half of the sandwich or packing it to go. For those who finish it, the ride home might seem like an eternity to get back to their beds for a long, Belly-fueled nap.

This past weekend I bought my first mate, which marks a major milestone in my immersion in the Argentine culture.  Now you might be wondering: This far into her exchange and she is only just now immersing herself? And, what in the world is a mate?
Mate (pronounced mah-teh) is the traditional beverage of Argentina and essential to the life of an Argentine.  It is a very caffeinated tea that is drank out of a special gourd.  The name mate can be used both in reference to the physical cup, what I bought this weekend, or the drink itself.  The mate yerba, which is similar to tea leaves, is packed into the gourd and then filled with hot water.  The bombilla that you then use to drink the mate is a metal straw with a filter at the bottom that separates the herb from the liquid.
At first glance, someone might look at the mate yerba and think it’s some sort of bizarre tribal ritual drug, but Argentines drink mate just as many other countries drink coffee or tea.  It is consumed at all times of the day, whether for a caffeine boost or to pass time with friends.  Unlike coffee or tea, however, there is a ritual that comes with drinking mate.  While there are slight variations depending on the region, the fundamentals are the same.
Usually, one mate is shared among a group.  This might seem weird to germaphobic North Americans, but it is expected when you share mate with someone that you all drink from the same bombilla. The server is the one whose mate you are drinking from.  He or she prepares the mate and is in charge of passing it around and refilling the hot water.  Though personally I have never experienced this, in some traditions it is the chore of the youngest in the group to serve the elders.
The proper way to be a participant in the mate circle is as follows: When you are offered the mate, you are expected to accept it and drink the entire contents of the mate. This doesn’t have to be in one drink, but rather over the course of a few sips during the conversation.  Don’t hold it too long while in a conversation though or you’ll be jokingly told that, “It’s not a microphone.”  You then hand it back to the server. Never pass it on to the next person, that is the server’s job.  He or she remembers the passing order and sticks to it.  Then, when you have had enough, you say gracias. This was weird for me at first because it was my instinct to thank them after sharing, but I quickly learned that wasn’t correct.
This seemingly strange tradition is a great way to connect with people.  I have enjoyed mate in a variety of scenarios during my time in Argentina.  My first introduction to mate was with my landlord after I moved in to my house. Since then, I have been offered it many times during class from classmates or professors, at work and even when I was checking into a hostel in Iguazu.  The receptionist offered me mate, and we passed it back and forth while he processed my reservation and gave me suggestions for my stay.
I am often asked by locals, “Do you like mate?”  Some people say it’s a flavor that takes getting used to, but since I typically like more bitter drinks (black coffee, unsweetened tea, etc.) I loved it right away.  Some people also put sugar in their mate to sweeten the yerba and cut the bitterness. This just depends on personal taste.
After my many shared mate experiences, I have grown to really appreciate the practice, particularly because it gives me a great gradual energy boost that helps me last through the long Argentine days. Noting this, I had been thinking for a while about buying a mate of my own but had been waiting to find one that was just right. They come in all shapes and sizes and are made out of different materials. I knew I wanted something on the smaller side that I could travel with and that was unique but also simple. This might sound like a lot of ridiculous criteria and thought for a mate, but this was a commitment and something that I hope to take back with me and have forever. Finally, after keeping an eye out for a long time, this weekend at the Feria de Mataderos, a traditional fair in Argentina, I found the perfect mate, a small smooth green wooden one.  My friend recommended that I get wood because it absorbs more of the flavor than the leather ones that are often very beautiful.
Everyone has his or her  own personal  preferences, which you can see this in the variety of mates  the locals carry around. You’ll never go a day without seeing someone on the street carrying their mate, typically accompanied by a thermos of hot water. There are even places that advertise the selling of hot water, this is how important it is. Though I haven’t invested in a thermos yet, I hope I can soon so that I can take my mate on the go just like a local.  Until then, I’ll be enjoying my mate in the comfort of my home.

As Subway awaits the celebration of its 50th anniversary in August, the once-favored sandwich chain has experienced a decline in sales faster than any other Top-25 American food chain. According to the Washington Post, the decline might be a result of Subway’s rivals stealing its customers away by offering fresher, healthier “build-your-own” meals. Ironically, it seems like Subway is losing at the game that it originally made popular.
According to Darren Tristano, the executive vice president of industry researcher Technomic, “The ‘Subway fresh’ has lost its appeal with customers, because to them fresh has evolved to mean something very different.” As health standards have evolved, many are choosing to eat at restaurants where they can enjoy healthier, tastier food.
Additionally, Tristano said that, “Subway’s strategy has only been to open more stores, and ultimately those stores just cannibalize each other.” It appears that Subway is not only losing customers from other restaurant chains; its own stores are also competing against one another for customers.
Within recent years, there has been a higher demand for healthier food options as customers are becoming more conscious of food and health. To keep up with changes in customer tastes, Subway expanded its menu by offering healthier add-ons, such as hummus and avocado. Its reduced sales, however, indicate a failure to use “healthy” as a marketing strategy.
As Subway starts to lose customers, chains such as Chipotle continue to experience a rise in sales.  In the last quarter of 2014, investors reported that Chipotle stores that had been open for more than a year had a 16.1 percent increase in sales. In this new environment where the importance of health quality has risen in customers’ minds, Chipotle is certainly the leading competitor.  With the motto, “food with integrity,” Chipotle has differentiated the quality of its food items compared to other “fast-casual” restaurants by ensuring that customers get the very best ingredients. The chain uses organic vegetables and meat from animals raised without hormones or antibiotics. By using ingredients of a higher caliber, Chipotle succeeds in alluring the health-conscious customers of today.
Chipotle’s success in the face of Subway’s decline can be boiled down to the fact that American customers have changed their concept of health, whereas Subway seemingly has not.
Subway’s attempt to continually brand itself as a “healthy” food chain has not proven successful, despite having a vegetarian-friendly menu full of fresh vegetables. Consumer surveys by Technomic found that, “Subway’s food taste, flavor and visual appeal sagged among American respondents over the past year.”  Restaurants such as Chipotle that have successfully marketed themselves as “healthy” undeniably play a huge role in the changing tastes and perspectives of customers. Subway’s inability to keep up with this trend has led to a lackluster ranking of 467 on Franchise Grade, a franchise polling and review service.  Other sandwich competitors, such as Firehouse Subs and Jersey Mike’s Subs, were ranked 107 and 108, respectively.
This transformation in the eating trends of the people, specifically in youths, is a positive reflection on educated eating habits.  In general, people have become more health conscious without wanting to compromise taste. After all, what would be better than getting the best of both worlds at a considerably cheap cost?
Subway’s declining sales shouldn’t come as breaking news. Until Subway realizes and accepts the evolved definition of “fresh” food for the American population, no amount of new stores opened can be successful in winning back its market segment.

Ireland recently became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage by a popular vote.  The referendum received an overwhelming 62.07 percent vote in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed.
In recent years, same-sex marriage has become one of the most prominent civil rights issues of our generation.  Regardless of religious or personal beliefs, Western societies have generally embraced the forward evolution of gay rights, with anti-LGBTQ laws being struck down in many countries.  And though the rights of the LGBTQ community are fast becoming recognized, the hetero-dominant society we live in appears to have little idea of what it actually means to be gay.  There is a vast tendency among the masses to pigeonhole the LGBTQ community into certain stereotypes.
What exactly do these stereotypes entail?  For a gay male, it inevitably means being a musical theater goer, an Oscar Wilde reader, a Madonna lover, and an Ina Garten super fan. For the most part, gay culture has been accepted within modern society, because anyone who expresses discomfort with homosexuality is immediately categorized as “homophobic,” and rightfully so.  Gay culture, however, is still mostly perceived as a podium for cattiness, camp and supreme promiscuity.  Among the more extreme and offensive stereotypes regarding gay men is the assumption that they are HIV positive and are perverts.  And though it is the heteronormative media that continues to perpetuate these stereotypes, they aren’t entirely to blame; a large demographic of gay men place arduous standards upon themselves to look, talk and act a certain way, especially in a metropolis such as Los Angeles. But, these characteristics represent only a certain portion of gay men. Is it fair to generalize an entire community based on a set of biased clichés?
David M. Halperin, a professor of history and theory of sexuality at University of Michigan, discusses these theories in his 2012 book How to Be Gay, saying, “‘Gayness is not a state or condition. It’s a mode of perception, an attitude, an ethos: In short, it is a practice.”  The gay counterculture of the 1970s, a world of glamour and immense dramatics, was not just a way for gay men to express themselves freely; it was essentially a giant middle finger directed towards the patriarchal, heteronormative society that oppressed them in the first place.
These stereotypes are further sustained within Hollywood’s media.  Many movie and television story arcs involving gay characters (within a mostly “straight” backdrop) seem to revolve solely around their sexual orientation. To give a popular example, the ABC primetime drama How to Get Away With Murder presents the character of Connor Walsh, an openly gay law student, who is portrayed as intelligent, confident and commanding.  He is also, however, depicted as highly promiscuous and narcissistic.  Though Walsh seems to have many layers that make him more than just another token gay character, the over-sexualization and cheek of his character are inevitably what viewers are going to remember and what critics are going to report on.
This stigma is also placed on celebrities or other notable figures who come out at as gay; once this detail about their personal lives is revealed, it’s suddenly as if their sexual orientation becomes the most important detail about them.  Society unconsciously praises gay men who fit within a masculine persona, yet expresses discomfort with those who show signs of femininity.  CNN reporter Anderson Cooper, who revealed he was gay to the public in 2012, is, for lack of better phrasing, stereotypically masculine, which somehow makes him exempt from many of the shames placed upon gay men.  Even actor Jack Falahee, who portrays Walsh on How to Get Away with Murder, refuses to disclose his own sexual orientation, saying in Out magazine that,  “We still live in this heteronormative, patriarchal society that is intent on placing everything within these binaries.” Society seems keen on classifying people into one specific category.  But why are we so concerned with labels?  Can’t one human love another human without this seemingly unavoidable compartmentalization?
Ireland’s legalization of gay marriage has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from LGBTQ members and allies across the globe, and has already inspired hope in other European countries to do the same.  But, we deserve more. The stereotypes that are placed not just upon gay men, but also on the other members of the LGBTQ community, must be eliminated to achieve full equality for all.

Teng and Spielman were announced as the prize recipients by the Association for Computing Machinery on May 27.
The Gödel Prize — named after Kurt Gödel, one of the pioneers of scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century — is awarded annually by the Association for Computer Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory and the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science for major contributions to mathematical logic and computer science
The coming of age of social media and handheld devices has brought forth many complex problems. Technology users are now generating mountains of data and navigating and sifting through that data swiftly and efficiently. This became a focal point for Teng and Spielman’s work.
“We need to develop faster algorithms because you can’t wait forever for your Google searches and social media searches. Linear time is the benchmark for modern day databases,” Teng said.
Efficiency of searching and sorting algorithms is key to modern day computing, and that is where Teng and Spielman have helped develop powerful algorithms. These algorithms are used to produce faster results for complex search problems with the same amount of computing power at their disposal.
“Graph algorithms have interested me since my days as a Ph.D. scholar, not just because they are central to a lot of modern day computing problems, but also because of their interdisciplinary nature,” Teng said.
During the course of his career, Teng has worked at a number of organizations such as IBM and Intel. At NASA, Teng helped develop pioneering computer software that uses finite element techniques to simulate aerodynamic models.
Teng spoke fondly about his co-recipient of the award, Spielman, with whom he shares a friendship that goes back many years, describing him as a man of great intellect.
The two first met when Teng was a Ph.D. student and common interests allowed them to collaborate on several occasions. This is the second time that they have been awarded the Gödel Prize. The previous was in 2008.
On being asked if he sometimes wishes for more computing power, Teng said that he’s learned to deal with it as more of a constraint.
“Greater computing power is something that has allowed us to solve and look at problems of greater complexity,” Teng said. “The scale of the problems change drastically. The two always go hand in hand.”
The award will be presented to Teng at the ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing, June 14-17 in Portland, Oregon.
cool ,where is the link of the algorithm

In a recent study by the Center for Collegiate Mental Health, anxiety replaced depression as the leading mental disorder for college students throughout the nation.
The study of more than 100,000 students noted that, in both professionally and personally-assessed evaluations, more than half of student clients sought treatment due to anxiety, followed by depression, stress and family/relationship issues.
The spike in anxiety cases has created concern from some medical professionals. In a recent New York Times article, Dan Jones, the director of counseling and psychological services at Appalachian State University, noted that some students are coming into the university setting mentally unprepared for the adult world.
“A lot are coming to school who don’t have the resilience of previous generations,” Jones told the New York Times. “They can’t tolerate discomfort or having to struggle. A primary symptom is worrying, and they don’t have the ability to soothe themselves.”
Overbearing or coddling parenting styles, though done for the sake of a child’s safety and wellbeing, could be one of the causes for this lack of resilience and the anxiety that develops in adolescence and the early-adult years.
Darby Saxbe, assistant professor of psychology at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, who was named a “Rising Star” by the Association for Psychological Science in 2013, has dedicated her research to making connections between social relationships and mental wellbeing and noted a connection between anxiety and family relationships.
“Kids develop anxiety when they feel like the environment has become strange,” Saxbe said. “So if you have a parent who is constantly monitoring you… it sends a really strong message that the world is not safe.”
“Helicopter parenting,” Saxbe said, could lead to potential problems later in life as children become adults. Entering into college, many students find themselves without the “umbrella” of parental support that they have grown dependent on.
“For the first time, you are really out of the house and you are trying to forge some kind of identity,” Saxbe said. “But you’ve absorbed this message throughout your whole childhood and adolescence that you know you can’t be trusted to handle adult things.”
A student who chose to remain anonymous noted the difficulties he had his first year at USC because of “helicopter parenting.”
“My parents always took care of everything,” he said. “I never had to worry about money or a future or anything. Coming to USC really made me come to terms with the fact that I was going to have to take care of myself and that was something I never had to face before.”
Another potential cause for increased anxiety in a college setting is the popularity of social networking – which constantly updates students on the success of their peers and colleagues and leads them to feel a decreased sense of self-worth.
Cristian Guzman, an undeclared sophomore, noted some of the negative effects of social media on an individual’s self-esteem.
“When you see people who finish projects and they are successful, that can be difficult to deal with,” Guzman said. “It makes you feel less confident about yourself, and you put yourself down.”
Katherine Duffy, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts, noted what she termed “artistic anxiety” at seeing other animation students’ postings on social media.
“Social media is a great medium, and it’s easy to become inspired by other peoples’ work,” Duffy said. “But then you’re like, ‘Oh gosh! I should be drawing and posting stuff even when I don’t have time to draw.’”
Saxbe said the difficulty that students have detaching themselves from social media is due to an evolutionary desire for information regarding our peers.
“It’s like a mouse pressing a lever to get sugar water,” Saxbe said. “It’s wired into us to want this but when there’s too much, it can overwhelm us. It’s so stimulating, and we’re so motivated to seek that out, but it’s hard to put the brakes on it.”
The potential problems stemming from increased dependence on social media networking is a fairly new problem and serves as “uncharted waters” according to Saxbe. There are still some things that students can do to prevent it from becoming overwhelming, however.
“It’s okay to step back,” Saxbe said. “It’s good to remind yourself that just because something is posted on Facebook doesn’t mean that someone is having more fun than you are. There is a lot of artifice on the Internet.”
 
I dig the bit about social media a LOT. That’s why I kinda dig people who
 are up front about anxiety on social media. Breaks the artifice.
I think it’s important to also recognize parental emotional abuse and heightened expectations when it comes to anxiety.
 People go to USC under a lot of pressure to succeed, I think, but at
the same time they’re being exposed to a whole mess of new ideas that
are challenging the status quo of how they’ve been brought up. I had one
 parent who thought that was awesome and another who drew away from me,
which was a painful though sobering and necessary experience.

The USC Alumni Education Network hosted “The Business of Education,” featuring two speakers who discussed the challenges and innovations possible in public schooling.
The event, which took place last week at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, featured Don Brann and Matthew Wunder. Brann holds degrees from both the Marshall School of Business and the Rossier School of Education.  He has a 40-year career in education, which includes creating Da Vinci Schools, a chain of charter schools in the U.S. that promotes real world experience and project-based learning, and leading various school districts.  Wunder is the CEO and one of the founders of Da Vinci Schools, with 25 years of experience in the education industry.
Wunder and Brann started the event with an exercise that was meant to teach the audience how difficult it is to deal with a school budget.  Brann spoke of how people often think of budget cuts as an obligation to cut costs, but he sees it as an opportunity to recruit more students.
“When I see there is some kind of discrepancy between what resources I have … and what I want to do. What I do is, I do not think of cutting things, I think of raising the revenue,” he said. “And, the main way to raise revenue is to raise the number of students that you serve.”
Having been successful in raising student enrollment at the Wiseburn Unified School District in California, Brann suggested ideas for increasing enrollment rates.  He told the audience that customer service was one of the most important things to focus on.
“I view America as a place that does not have sufficient customer service, and Americans are very hungry for people to work with and to serve them that care,” he said. “To me, the way to connect people and to hook them was to give them great customer service, so that is what we based the transformation of Wiseburn School District.”
He noticed that many of the students in the district came from homes where their parents were working full time, and they often found themselves coming back from school to an empty house.  Brann addressed this problem by implementing a before- and after-school program, in which he helped build a bridge between the parents’ schedules and the kids’ schedules in school.  By making parents’ lives work logistically, he helped increase the amount of students enrolled.
Additionally, Brann made changes in the school to account for what parents’ valued in a school.  Brann implemented lower class sizes and easier access to the principal, among other details that parents’ were interested in.  He also achieved higher test scores. Then, the program was marketed through offices of big employers throughout the district, ones that would attract busy parents who wanted their children in good schools.
In the 15 years that Brann worked in the Wiseburn School District, he never made budget cuts. Instead of layoffs and slashing the budget, he implemented things that would attract more students to enroll and, therefore, increase revenue.
Brann’s new project is working with the Inglewood School District, where he said he has found many problems with corruption and bad management.  When he arrived, Brann found that people were stealing food and textbooks and then reselling them for a profit. In the last seven years, Brann said Inglewood has lost 28 percent of its students. Brann’s new project is to save Inglewood from debt and plummeting enrollment rates.
Wunder closed the event with information on the difficulties students are facing on the path from education to employment. He discussed how he and Brann are trying to improve this process for students through the Da Vinci Schools.
Instead of being focused on test scores, Da Vinci Schools focus on habits of mind — such as character and perseverance — 21st century skills, presentational learning and public speaking skills.
The speakers said that though there are 30 million Americans looking for work, there are also 5 million unfilled jobs across the country because applicants don’t have the skills employers are looking for.  There is a big discrepancy between what employees offer and what employers are looking for, and this has caused a huge employment crisis in America.
This is one of the main reasons why Wunder and Brann helped found the Da Vinci Schools.  They aim to graduate students with the skills that employers are looking for in potential candidates.
“Our education to employment pipeline doesn’t line up well with jobs,” Wunder said, “And so the transformation that we think needs to happen is that we connect the pipeline and we start with the end user, those employers.”
Education: if you don’t start with how to be a good person/citizen, the rest doesn’t help society.

After eliminating No. 2 Texas in the quarterfinals, the No. 13 men’s golf team has advanced to its first ever NCAA championship semifinals.
The trio of junior Bobby Gojuangco, sophomore Rico Hoey and freshman Sean Crocker combined for a 3-0 victory to lift the Trojans past the Longhorns and on to the semifinals. Gojuangco won 4 and 2, Hoey won 2 and 1 and Crocker won his final three holes to seal the victory.
The last time the Trojans reached the NCAA Championships match play bracket was in 2009 when they suffered a loss to Michigan in the quarterfinal match.
Gojuangco kicked things off for the Trojans but fell behind early. He tied the match on the third hole, however, and never forfeited his lead. A birdie on the seventh hole clinched Gojuangco’s win.
Hoey led his match for the duration but was never able to widen his lead by more than two holes. Hoey first took his lead with a birdie on the 18th hole and hung on to win the match for the Trojans.
Crocker’s victory seemed improbable, as he fell behind by three after 12 holes. He won two on the fourth hole and won holes eight and nine to tie it up. Finishing with a par on the 10th hole, Crocker overtook his Longhorn opponent to win the match.
If the Trojans advance past Illinois in the semifinals, they will head to the NCAA Championships on June 3 in Bradenton, Florida.

There have been defining moments in my time as a Trojan when “fight on” wasn’t just a phrase, but a palpable feeling, a moment in time that I wish I could put in my back pocket and save for a rainy day. On Sunday, I went to sleep after midnight, exhausted and heartbroken after watching the baseball team lose in extra innings to Virginia. Though it was a tough loss, I couldn’t help but walk away feeling like the team could easily be looking at a trophy next season. The Lake Elsinore Regional was an uphill battle for the Trojans after dropping the first game to Virginia and falling into the loser’s bracket, but the team advanced to the regional final, always finding a way to fight on.
After narrowly missing the tournament last season, the Trojans displayed the fight of a team that was hungry to make up for its past absences. Their opening game against Virginia began with flawless defense by USC, with junior starter Kyle Davis boasting a no-hitter through six innings. That was as far as the defense held up, and with the bats failing to come alive, the Trojans lost their opening match to last year’s runner up, 6-1.
Immediately falling into the loser’s bracket makes for an unlikely trip to the Super Regional. The Trojans didn’t advance out of Lake Elsinore, but their following two games demonstrated their grit, talent and potential for the upcoming season.
To keep their season alive, the Trojans called on their teamwork and trust in each other to give them the edge. Kyle Twomey led the Trojans to a 12-3 statement win over UC Santa Barbara. The final score does not reflect the battle the Trojans fought to stay alive to face SDSU. When the defense failed, the offense was there to keep the season alive, and vice versa. Heading into the eighth inning with a 5-1 lead, the Gauchos plated two runs to cut the Trojans’ lead to 5-3 and load the bases with two outs. Junior lefty Tyler Gilbert came in and got a crucial strikeout to end the inning and ensure that his teammate Twomey would get the win.
SDSU threatened to end the Trojans’ season early in an elimination game for both teams, taking a 3-0 lead after two innings. The Trojans answered with seven runs over three innings to take a 7-3 lead as freshman starter Mitch Hart settled down and did not allow any more runs. The Aztecs began to figure Hart out and took an 11-7 lead through the eighth inning. The Trojans were able to score two runs in the eighth to come within 11-9 but still entered the ninth trailing by two runs. With two outs in the top of the ninth, Jeremy Martinez drove in two runs with a single to take a 12-11 lead. Even with only one out standing between them and the end of their season, the Trojans managed to stay alive yet again.
Though the season came to an end against Virginia, the Trojans’ playoff run capped an exciting season that included an impressive weekend of wins against TCU, Vanderbilt and UCLA at the Dodger Stadium Baseball Classic in March.
The Trojans will lose senior starters Dante Flores and Garrett Stubbs, along with Angelo La Bruna and Omar Cotto Lozada. Stubbs was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year as well as a semifinalist for the Johnny Bench Award. His leadership, talent and calm presence behind the plate will be missed next season, but the Trojans will have something that not a single member of this squad had — experience.
All in all, things are looking up for the 12-time national champs. Head coach Dan Hubbs has turned the team around in only three seasons, and assuming that the non-seniors opt to return, the team will only get better with experience. But if you’re having a hard time accepting that the season is over, take solace in the fact that UCLA, a No. 1 seed and host of their regional, didn’t advance to the Super Regional either, which they would’ve hosted.

The No. 15 Trojans fell 14-10 to No. 30 Virginia in 11 innings in the regional final early Monday morning. The Trojans’ NCAA tournament appearance was their first since 2005. In their four games at the Lake Elsinore Regional, the Trojans scored a total of 35 runs and had 34 runs scored against them. They finished the regional 2-2.
The team’s offensive power kept them competitive. As was evident in the 12-11 win over SDSU and second Virginia game, USC’s offense constantly challenged the other team to try and match the offensive production.
Standouts for the Trojans this past weekend were senior catcher Garrett Stubbs, sophomore first baseman Jeremy Martinez and redshirt sophomore shortstop Reggie Southall, who were all named to the All-Regional Team.
Stubbs was also named the Lake Elsinore Regional MVP. Not only did he demonstrate an outstanding performance behind the plate, but he also had a solid performance at the plate going 9-for-16 (.563) with three RBIs and four runs.
Catching all 36 innings of the regional, Stubbs was sliding and blocking behind the plate to back up his pitchers and keep them out-of-jams. When they began to feel uneasy and issue a walk, Stubbs kept calm and dialed in for the next batter.
Martinez went 7-for-19 with 10 RBIs. Martinez was most successful in Sunday’s game, driving in eight of USC’s 22 runs. His approach at the plate was focused and collected, and paid off when he hit the ball.
The Trojans opened up the Lake Elsinore Regional against No. 30 Virginia. Junior starter Kyle Davis had a no-hitter going through six innings, but it wasn’t enough to stop the No. 3 seed, who scored two runs off of Davis in the seventh. It was the longest no-hitter held by a Trojan since Rik Currier tossed one in a       five-inning, rain-shortened game vs. Mississippi State in 2000.
USC had a number of opportunities, but couldn’t seem to match the Cavaliers’ hitting as they lost 6-1.
On Saturday afternoon, the Trojans needed a win against   No. 13, top-seeded UC Santa Barbara, to stay alive. They found their overwhelming 12-3 win from junior starter Kyle Twomey.
Twomey tossed 7.1 innings, allowing three runs in seven hits, while walking three and striking out three.
The offensive attack started slowly in the top of the third with an RBI double from Stubbs. USC then scored once in the top of the fifth, twice in the top of the seventh and once in the top of the eighth. After eight full innings, USC led 5-3.
In the top of the ninth, the Trojans’ offense exploded and chalked up seven runs on the board. This would serve as a preview to the highly offensive day the Trojans would have on Sunday.
On Sunday afternoon, the Trojans faced fourth seed SDSU in another elimination game. It was a back-and-forth offensive game that would have any baseball fan on the edge of his or her seat. USC overcame an 11-7 deficit to win 12-11.
SDSU came out to a quick 3-0 lead, but by the sixth inning, the Trojans would claim a 7-3 lead. With their Rally Buckets on full display, the Aztecs jumped ahead 8-7 in the bottom of the sixth and then extended their lead to 11-7.
The Trojans one-upped SDSU and pulled out their Rally Chairs in the bullpen. USC scored five unanswered runs to go up 12-11 in the top of the ninth.
Every Trojan in the line-up recorded at least one hit, with Martinez going 2-for-6 with a team-high of four RBIs. His            two-out, two-RBI single in the ninth gave USC the go-ahead run.
With only about an hour of rest, the Trojans were right back on the field to face Virginia once again.  Through four innings of play, the game had already lasted about two hours. As the clock ticked on, it seemed as if the game was never going to end. Then when Sunday became Monday, the game went into extra innings.
This wasn’t the only extended regional game; the Rice vs. Houston game went a total of 20 innings and lasted six hours and two minutes, concluding just past 2 a.m. CDT, with Rice winning 3-2.
After about a 40-minute first inning, USC led 5-4. USC — with a little help from their Rally Chairs — took control of the game with a 9-6 lead through five innings, but Virginia wasn’t about to go away without a fight. The Cavaliers tied it up 9-9 in the eighth.
As the game dragged on, USC started to feel the effects of 10 hours of baseball. Virginia took full advantage of coming through the winner’s bracket and busted open the game in the top of the 11th by scoring five runs to make it 14-9.
In rhythm with the rest of their weekend, the Trojans mustered up enough power to get one run on the board in the bottom of the 11th to make it 14-10, proving that they wouldn’t go down without a fight, but it just wasn’t enough to battle both fatigue and the Cavaliers. Late in the game, Virginia capitalized on Trojan errors to tie and then win the game, ending USC’s season.
The Trojans finished the season with a 39-21 overall record and finished second in the Lake Elsinore region.

After three action-packed days of qualifying in Austin, Texas, the NCAA track and field championship fields are set, with 25 Trojans in the finals.  The championships will be held  in Eugene, Oregon, from June 10-13.
The first athlete to qualify was freshman and two-sport standout Adoree’ Jackson, in the long jump.  Jackson entered the competition ranked 16 in the region with only the top 12 advancing.  Jackson, who jumped 25 feet 8 inches, moved up to seventh place.
Jackson has a chance to break into the top-10 all-time USC list, which has been left undisturbed since 2003.  All eyes will be on Jackson in the championships to see if he can continue his ascension to the top, as well as to see if he can score a place on USC’s record list.
The men’s high jump will also see a Trojan, freshman Randall Cunningham, competing in the championships. Cunningham cleared 7-2.5 in his third attempt, which was good enough for sixth place and a ticket to Eugene.
On the second day of action, sixteen Trojans qualified for the championships, in a variety of field events.
Among them, senior Conor McCullough, who decimated the competition with a 246-1 on his second attempt in the hammer throw to win by over 10 feet.  Leading up to the preliminary rounds of qualifying, only three other throwers had a distance of over 230 feet.  McCullough will be looking to cap his year with a national title.
Junior Tera Novy found success in the discus throw, finishing fourth in the competition.  Fellow discus thrower, senior Alexandra Collatz, secured a ticket to Oregon by finishing just behind Novy in the fifth position of the competition.
With the final day of qualifying on the schedule, the 4×100 relay team for both the men and the women qualified for championships by finishing with the fifth fastest qualifying time.
The Women of Troy found significant success in the 100 HH.  Two USC athletes advanced to Oregon, freshman Dior Hall and senior Melia Cox.  Hall had the second fastest qualifying time, with a 13.15.  Cox set a personal best with her time of 13.24.  The time set Cox into a tie with Natasha Neal for 10th place on USC’s all-time 100 HH list, and was also the fifth-fastest time in the competition.
Senior BeeJay Lee and junior Andre De Grasse qualified not only as members of the men’s 4×100 relay, but also in both the 100m and 200m races.                      De Grasse and Lee were side by side in the 200m, and De Grasse finished with a winning time of 20.17 with Lee in second with 20.47 to leave little doubt of their qualifications.
The final event of the day proved perhaps most exciting for USC.  The women’s 4×400 relay was the fastest time in qualifying and also set a new USC school record. Junior Jaide Stepter, sophomore Amalie Iuel, freshman Kendall Ellis and senior Vanessa Jones not only led the whole time, but also added to their margin of victory with each leg extending the lead.
The time of 3:27.86 cracked the USC record of 3:28.08 that had stood since 1999.  The time is also the second fastest in the nation this year.
