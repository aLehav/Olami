When Viola Davis won the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, the entire auditorium gave her a standing ovation. 
Some believe that stars the likes of Angelina Jolie, Meryl Streep and Michelle Williams rose from their chairs because of Davis’ groundbreaking role and win. After all, it’s not every day a black actress beats out the powerful Meryl Streep for an award voted on by other actors. 
And although it’s nice to see people responding to the slowly dissipating racial barriers permeating Hollywood’s rather rigged awards structure, some commentators have claimed that as long as you make a movie about any minority – Jews, African Americans, Italians – the awards are bound to be bountiful.
Since The Help was about a bunch of maids servicing white people in Jackson, Mississippi (circa 1962), Davis apparently falls into this category.
What people don’t understand is that the accolades being thrown Davis’ way is not due to the fact that she’s black and played a maid and made everyone cry. Her performance was incredible. Period.
She should not be punished because people believe that her role was “too black” or too hackneyed. Playing a maid in 2012 does not set the African American race back. Playing a maid so convincingly and providing a performance that other actors could only envy actually springs our race forward.
Hopefully, movies like Tyler Perry Presents Madea’s Family Reunion will cease to exist as those roles are more of a stereotype than any other I could think of.
Davis sets a great example for black women hoping to emulate her sort of success. I only wish I had someone like her while I was growing up. She shows us that you’re not playing into “White Hollywood” if you accept a role in a big budget film.
If you’re given the chance, take it. Not only that, knock it out of the ballpark like she did.
Come Oscar Sunday, I can only hope that Davis is the one to walk up to that podium. Not because she’s black, but simply because she was the best.

Die-hard fans of classic musical theater like Les Misérables, Miss Saigon and the Phantom of the Opera will recognize the name Ramin Karimloo. However, with the planned release of his solo album Ramin on March 5, “Karimloo” just might be as commonplace as “Menzel” and “Crawford.”
Known for his recent run as Jean Valjean in Les Mis and for originating the role of the Phantom in Love Never Dies, Karimloo has achieved a monumental amount of success for his thirty-three years. His powerful tenor and chilling vibrato have landed him roles in the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Misérables, as well as the honor of being the youngest male to play the title character in the Phantom of the Opera. Older theatergoers are in awe of his heavenly voice, while younger audiences are just as entranced by his stunning good looks and enchanting charisma.
But Karimloo is known for so much more than his voice and pretty face.
With his multi-faceted reputation, Karimloo is certainly not a one-dimensional performer —he’s earned repute for his versatility.  In Les Misérables alone, he’s played three different roles: the convict Jean Valjean, the rebel Enjolras and the lover Marius. The same goes for his stints in the Phantom of the Opera, where he’s graced the stage as the wounded Phantom as well as the confident Raoul. His talents stretch further to the movie version of Webber’s musical, where he had a brief cameo role as Christine’s father. When Karimloo does a musical, he makes sure to cover all his bases.
Yet he’s also a bit of a risk-taker. Karimloo sports several tattoos on his arm –everything from blackbirds to poetry– an image that contrasts sharply with his refined, high-brow theater persona. He’s similarly experimental with his career. By originating the role of the Phantom in Love Never Dies, the questionable sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, Karimloo proves that he takes shows he’s interested in –he doesn’t wait for public approval.
Hopefully, his new album, which will feature original, self-written pieces as well as his show tune favorites, will demonstrate more of his ability to surprise and astound his audiences.
Still, while you wait for the album’s release, catch him on the 25th Anniversary Phantom of the Opera soundtrack and DVD out on February 7th.
