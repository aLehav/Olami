Carol Folt, the former chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has been named USC’s 12th president following a unanimous vote by the Board of Trustees, the University announced Wednesday. 
Folt, who is entering USC amid several scandals and lawsuits against the University, will serve as the first female president in USC’s 139-year history. She will replace Interim President Wanda Austin, who was appointed last August. 
The University announced the decision to appoint Folt in an email to the USC community Wednesday. At a press conference, Folt said she, along with others she spoke with at USC, are ready and willing to create change at the University. 
“Sometimes when you have challenges, you are in the best position to make change,” Folt said at the press conference. “I haven’t heard any voice of complacency … No one is saying, ‘Everything is perfect, don’t tell us we have to change.’”
Folt, a biologist with extensive experience in higher education, will begin her duties July 1. Before coming to UNC, Folt served at Dartmouth University for 30 years as a faculty member, provost and interim president for the school.
“It is the greatest privilege in the world to be a first,” Folt said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “You carry this amazing opportunity to talk about it. But truth: no first comes without thousands of people. I just look at what [Austin’s] done, and I am the beneficiary of all that.”
During her six years as chancellor of North Carolina’s flagship university, Folt faced multiple high-profile controversies. She assumed the position following national news of a long-running academic fraud scheme involving student athletes whose course schedules included classes — which never met in person — to help them fit the academic requirements for playing. 
Folt resigned from her position in January 2019. The decision came one day after she approved the removal of a Confederate statue on campus that many students deemed racist.
Folt said the decision to remove the base of a Confederate monument at UNC has given her peace of mind, and situations involving history and nomenclature are often nuanced. Austin recently created the University Task Force on Nomenclature to create a process for students concerned with building names and monuments to submit their concerns.
Folt dealt with multiple internal and NCAA investigations of the athletics scandal and terminated faculty members involved in the incidents. She said her experiences at UNC have prepared her to effect change at USC. 
“Honesty, accountability, candor. If the community wants that, we are already so far ahead,” Folt said. “That gives me the chance to come in and take actions that get us there.”
In addition to the college admissions scheme and the class action lawsuit against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who was accused of years of sexual misconduct, Folt will assume the responsibility of handling a suit against a former campus doctor who allegedly sexually assaulted over 20 male students, and a class action suit against the University alleging unfair admissions processes in light of the bribery scandal. 
At the press conference, Folt said she accepted the position because she wanted to help the University work toward change following the recent turmoil. 
“I believe so deeply in what [USC] has done and what it can do,” Folt said at the press conference. “I also have learned that you take on challenges by never forgetting your bigger mission and the good things that happen. It’s that pairing that I think brings the vibrancy. If we have no challenges, it just means no one’s finding [them].”
In a statement to the USC community, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said Folt is a leader who will guide the University with students, faculty and staff in mind.
“As I have come to know Dr. Folt and how she thinks, it is clear that USC has chosen a brilliant, principled leader with clarity of purpose and integrity to lead the university forward and upward,” Caruso said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “Ours was a global search, and we spoke to over a hundred diverse and world-class candidates.”
Folt was selected by the 23-member Presidential Search Advisory Committee comprising Caruso, Austin, Academic Senate President Yaniv Bar-Cohen, members of the Board of Trustees and faculty, along with search firms Isaacson Miller and Heidrick & Struggles. The committee was formed in August. 
“There was so much diversity on the search committee, and I was actually very worried about it in the beginning, because to have 23 people all get aligned, and if you looked at the criteria, it was a long set of criteria,” Caruso said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There was a great sense of camaraderie, there was a great sense of transparency, everybody shared information, everybody had healthy discussions, everybody had a different point of view. At the end of the day, it was unanimous.”
Caruso said Folt was selected from a list of 100 potential candidates, which was narrowed down to three primary candidates during the search process. 
“The last three were all exceptional,” Caruso said in the interview. “Obviously, [Folt] stood out for a number of reasons but all [were] really exceptional. And then we had a half-day session to make a decision, and it was unanimous on [Folt].”
Caruso said he hopes that Folt looks to the search committee as an advisory group as she transitions into her new role as head of the University. 
The Presidential Search Advisory Committee hosted three listening sessions since September to gauge which values and qualities students, faculty and staff wanted to see in USC’s next president. According to the search committee website, many expected the next president to have cultural competency and experience running a large institution. Those who participated in the sessions said the University needs to increase its transparency and commitment to students. At the press conference Wednesday, Folt said she has listened to these town halls to prepare for the position. 
Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee said she believes Folt’s previous experience with controversies at UNC will prepare her to take on the role of USC president. 
“I think it’s evident that she has a clear understanding of what’s ethically right, and I think just from hearing a very small glimpse of who she is and what she’s done and what she stands for, it makes me excited to know that she’s going to be leading us,” Lee said.
Graduate Student Government Vice President of Programming Kris Coombs, Jr. said he is interested in seeing how Folt will work to rebuild trust within the USC community. 
“There’s been a lot of concern given everything the University has been through, so I am optimistic that she’ll know what to do,” Coombs said. “It will be difficult since there’s so many of us, but that’ll be nice to be able to watch her and see how she takes leadership in a different direction.” 
USC community members have called for increased transparency and accountability from the University in light of recent controversies. At an open University Forum Tuesday, several members of the USC community spoke out about what they hope to see in the next leader of the University. 
“I feel the president needs to have at least one person whose job it is to look at the president and say, ‘I don’t think this is benefitting students,’” Mark Malan, a member of the Staff Assembly and an accounting technician in the Provost’s Office, said at the forum. “Because I don’t think Nikias had that.”

 Graduate student Deborah McDonald was sleeping in the parking lot of a Vons supermarket in Inglewood before she came to USC to study social work. When she arrived, she sought help from the University, but she was met with little support. 
“I told [an admissions counselor] what was going on with me. The first thing she told me was that USC could not help me with housing,” McDonald said to a room of around 250 students, faculty and staff at an open forum held Tuesday to address community concerns. 
McDonald eventually learned about USC’s Homelessness Initiative, which includes access to a virtual food pantry and the USC Civic Engagement Housing Law Clinic, but she and other attendees at the forum said they are still not satisfied with the amount of resources available — or their level of accessibility.
“I hope that, after bringing this up, there’s more eyes and ears on the USC Housing Law Clinic,” said Jesse Ramirez, a graduate student in the Sol Price School of Public Policy. “Right now, if you go to the website and try to look them up, it’s as if they’re ghosts.” 
Tuesday’s forum, which was organized by the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments, the Staff Assembly and the Academic Senate, was held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center with a live video feed from the Health Sciences Campus. The forum, held a week after the FBI disclosed that USC is at the forefront of the largest college admissions scandal in U.S. history, served as an opportunity for members in the campus community to voice their concerns about the state of the University. 
Plans for the forum were announced on March 6, weeks after six gay and bisexual former students filed a lawsuit against the University and former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly, whom they accused of sexual harassment and gender violence. The number of plaintiffs has now risen to 21, and the University has yet to release an official public statement on the lawsuit. 
“The only way we can really care for our students here is to reinstate a sense of trust in our administration, and that really comes from a sense of accountability for things that have happened [like the Kelly allegations],” said Katie Thanos, a junior majoring in law, history and culture. “We feel like we’re being left in the dark, [and] we feel like our tuition dollars are being sent somewhere where they just kind of disappear … we don’t feel like we’re being listened to.” 
Campus leaders such as USG president and vice president-elects Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin, Interim President Wanda Austin and Academic Senate President Yaniv Bar-Cohen were in attendance. Bar-Cohen stressed that Austin and other members of the administration were there to listen to the community’s conversation. 
“I think this is a wonderful experiment, and I’m really glad to be in the room,” Austin said. “What’s most encouraging to me is the fact that we create these forums where we can have a diversity of opinion around difficult issues.” 
The forum was held a week after the FBI disclosed in its investigation that USC is at the center of the largest college admissions bribery scheme in U.S. history, with the largest number of parents and University officials involved out of the eight colleges named.
The first of two conversational prompts at the forum asked how USC can balance tuition hikes with its goal of providing students with high-quality education.
Multiple people spoke about their personal experiences with financial insecurity on campus, from housing issues to the tuition hike that was announced Tuesday — raising next academic year’s tuition by 3.5 percent to $57,256.
Madeline McCue, a junior majoring in international relations and global health, said that amid rising costs, she believes USC should have a stake in its students’ success after they graduate.
“If the University is not adequately preparing you for a job that will get you that kind of income to pay back a student loan, it’s not worth it — quite literally,” McCue said. 
Students and faculty from both campuses spoke about the issue of food insecurity.
“I really hate the fact that we call it food scarcity,” said Mark Malan, a member of the staff assembly and an accounting technician in the Provost’s office. “We have students that would be starving if it were not for the food bank. Putting fancy words on it doesn’t change the fact that these kids don’t have food.” 
At the forum, Malan also spoke about rising costs of housing on and near the University Park Campus.
“[Developers] are going to charge $1,000 per bed … around USC,” Malan said. “And the reason they know they can charge that is because they know what USC Housing is charging for the dorm rooms. We, USC, drive this local housing market.” 
Shany Ebadi, USG’s co-chief diversity officer, said she wished the administration offered immediate responses to people’s concerns. She also said she had hoped for a bigger turnout.
“I think the attendance could have been better,” Ebadi said. “If we are having these discussions there should be much more voices at the table, instead of the government representatives that are already doing this advocacy.”

Rep. Joe Kennedy III  gave students and spectators a glimpse into the emerging political world and what they can do in preparation for the upcoming 2020 presidential elections in an event hosted at Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday.
Nearly 200 students, faculty and staff filled the forum as the Massachusetts congressman arrived at the podium.  The conversation, moderated by Center for Political Future Director Bob Shrum, was hosted in collaboration with the Political Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government, the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and the Dornsife Center for Political Future. 
Kennedy discussed his support of equal rights for all communities and how the idea of equality in America has typically and historically benefitted wealthy, white and Protestant men. 
“So many in our country have fought, and struggled and bled, and some even died to try to make that definition more representative of the people that actually called this nation home,” Kennedy said. “The fact is that even today, 200 and some odd years later that there are still segments of our society, they do not just do it just the same level of federal protection that I do, as a straight white guy.” 
Shrum shifted the topic to the debate on the GOP oversight regarding the  Trump-Russia investigation. Kennedy shared his personal opinions on the case, but said the results of the Robert Mueller investigation, which revealed multiple accounts of collusion in the administration, are more important.  
“I think it was a huge abdication of [the House of Representatives] responsibility … and so, we’re going to step in,” Kennedy said. “The one thing that I know is that Robert Mueller knows more about this than I do. And I think personally that is extremely important to let Mr. Mueller finish that process, to present that information to the attorney general.”
Kennedy also analyzed how the 2016 victory for President Trump has shaped modern politics.
“I think, essentially what Donald Trump has done has been extremely good at creating a reality for our country, where those that ‘have’ are doing extremely well and those that ‘don’t’ are being pitted against each other,” Kennedy said. 
Kennedy believes that, to win in future elections, Democrats need to appeal to the general population by being clearer with their policies and attacking the Republicans’ weak points.
“The question I think Democrats have to be able to articulate clearly and simply is, ‘Why would you prefer a system forced by the President of the United States, where those at the top get everything and those that are struggling and striving are left to fight over the scraps?” he said. 
According to Kennedy, previous presidential candidates have had trouble empathizing with their voters and have disregarded specific groups of voters by ignoring their problems. He said Sen. Elizabeth Warren has worked to counter this by campaigning in less represented states.
“It is easy to project and to dehumanize the other,” Kennedy said. “Elizabeth Warren spent the last couple of days in Mississippi and Alabama, going places that are not exactly on the traditional tour for Democratic candidates for the presidency, but to lean into this and to try to say those voices count.” 
After the conversation, one student asked about how voters can stay unified come the 2020 presidential election. Kennedy said voters need to support candidates who everyone can stand behind.
“What you need to do is have folks that win those nominations with the confidence and the support of the American public,” Kennedy said. “That’s what the system demands, and that’s what we deserve.” 
Junior Briana Miles, director of the Political Student Assembly, helped organize the speaking event. Miles said the organization wanted to host someone from the Democratic Party to discuss the 2020 presidential primary, as 14 candidates have announced their candidacies so far.
“It’s been a very interesting political year, and we wanted to try to get somebody that was in office to get some perspective on what’s happening right now, kind of how the processes are going and what issues they find important to them,” Miles said. “The Democratic primary is very big right now, so we wanted to get a democratic perspective on things are going on.”

Ever since senior Matthew Crane formed a close bond with a trauma surgeon at a local hospital he worked at, he knew he wanted to be a public health professional.
Now, the human biology major and Undergraduate Student Government Speaker Pro Tempore has become the youngest person ever elected as a Los Angeles City Health Commission.
Crane was sworn in on March 11, and will represent the 13th district of Los Angeles.
“I thought what [the trauma surgeon] did was really interesting,” Crane said. “I saw how he took care of the whole community … I thought, ‘That’s what I want to do.’” 
The Los Angeles City Health Commission’s goals are to evaluate the health needs of the city’s population, determine whether these needs are being met and implement cost-effective policies which address them, according to L.A. County Department of Public Health program director Nicole Vick. 
“We provide policy recommendations on everything, from evaluating existing projects to proposing new ideas — trying to stem public health issues where they start,” Crane said. “Many of the things deal with social health disparities and advocacy on behalf of people who might not have as much of a voice in city council.” 
Crane said his experience as a pre-med student, speaker pro tempore in Undergraduate Student Government, director of Emergency Medical Services at USC and president of the American Red Cross chapter at USC motivated him to approach medicine from the perspective of social advocacy. 
“[I] saw a lot of problems with how education and public health was tackled by the campus,” Crane said. “I saw victims of sexual assault from my work [with EMS], and I saw issues of homelessness around USC with the Red Cross. I thought, ‘There’s got to be a better way to do this.’” 
Crane worked with USG Sen. Jillian Halperin, a junior majoring in communication, and other senators to create the Bystander Intervention Training Program, a project that requires at least one executive board member of every registered student organization to undergo training to learn how to intervene in unsafe situations.
“He … chaired [the project] and was really helpful in coordinating with so many different campus partners in making sure that we could get the project funded,” Halperin said. “We really couldn’t have done that without him.” 
Crane said that he often notices parallels between his work experience as a student and his current position as health commissioner, since they both entail serving and advocating for the well-being of specific communities.
“Making the biggest impact on the community is something that I find personally rewarding,” Crane said. “When you look at really big issues — whether it’s homelessness in Los Angeles or sexual assault at USC — these are things that really need to be targeted with policies … that are wide-reaching. I think that public health is the way that you … solve those problems.” 
Vick said she first met Crane when he reached out to her for an internship opportunity after she came to speak at a USC Red Cross chapter meeting in 2017. 
“I’m really happy that he took the initiative to ask,” Vick said. “I did not have a formal intern application … he just asked for the opportunity and we figured it out.” 
As an intern, Crane was the primary author of the commission’s 2018 annual report, which presented and addressed a wide variety of issues facing the L.A. community, ranging from disease outbreaks to public bathroom availability. 
“The report establishes background for a lot of different areas of improvement within Los Angeles — things like sobering centers and public bathroom availability,” Crane said. “It provides a summary of where the issue is at right now, and then it provides policy recommendations.” 
After working on the annual report and reading an article about UC Berkeley students being sworn into commissions, Crane said he was motivated to become a member.
“There were a few vacancies in the health commission,” Crane said. “I thought, ‘I’ll toss my resume in,’ and I got picked.” 
Vick said she has no doubt that Crane will continue to pursue public health advocacy as a commission member with the same passion and drive he had as an intern.
“I think this is going to be an extension of who he has been as an intern — very forward-thinking, anticipatory, coming up with new ideas, always willing to take that extra step,” Vick said. 
Crane said he has a lot to learn from the veterans in his commission and is excited to implement concrete policies that will benefit the community. 
“There’s a lot of adults very experienced in politics [in the commission], and I’m just trying to catch up and learn what political advocacy looks like at that level,” Crane said. 
The commission and Crane are currently focused on drafting a resolution — set to be published next month — concerning health issues impacting citizens on Skid Row.
“There was a recent Typhus outbreak, and right now, that’s a big focus for the city health commission,” Crane said. “We’re drafting a letter to the mayor regarding pest-resistant trash bins and having those made available in Skid Row.” 
Crane will work with the commission over the summer until October, and in Fall 2019, he will attend The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 
“They were my first choice: they’re the No. 1 school for public health,” Crane said. “It was a really great fit at the interview … I’ll be attending there in the fall, pursuing an M.D. and hopefully an M.P.H. [Master of Public Health].” 
Halperin said she’s excited for the next chapter in Crane’s life.
“Whatever he puts his mind to, he’s just going to succeed,” Halperin said. “I can’t believe he’s graduating and moving on, but he’s truly an incredible person and an incredible colleague.”

Over 700 friends, family and community members gathered Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom to honor the life of Victor McElhaney, a senior who died March 10. McElhaney died of a gunshot wound to the head, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office. 
As people entered the auditorium, a slideshow of videos and photos played, set to the jazz tune “Live at the BlackHawk” by Miles Davis. 
In the back of the ballroom, attendees were encouraged to sign a USC flag and write letters to put in a drumstick case for McElhaney’s family. 
McElhaney studied jazz and drumset studies at the Thornton School of Music, and was actively involved in the black community at USC through the Center for Black and Cultural Student Affairs and the organization Brothers Breaking B.R.E.A.D. (Barriers, Regrets, Egos, Animosity and Doubt), which aimed to empower black men on campus. At the beginning of this semester, McElhaney served as the co-president of the organization.
To begin the memorial, several administrators and faculty spoke about McElhaney’s impact on their life. 
“It wasn’t a question of whether Vic wanted to be a leader,” CBCSA Assistant Director Theo Fowles said. “It was a statement that Vic was a leader we needed … With Vic, there were no barriers, there were only intersections.” 
Peter Erskine, the director of drumset studies at the Thornton school, privately taught McElhaney for a year. 
“He was quiet, but he spoke up,” Erskine said. “He was proud, but he was humble. He was serious, but he would smile too.” 
Black Alumni Association Executive Director Michelle Turner announced that BAA would create a student scholarship named and awarded in McElhaney’s honor. 
“He held the idea and concept of community dearly,” Turner said. “He was an exemplar of black pride and excellence.” 
Other faculty and administrators, including Thornton Dean Rob Cutietta, Senior Associate Dean of Religious Life Jim Burklo and McElhaney’s academic advisor, Viet Bui, also spoke.
The memorial also included performances by Thornton faculty and students. 
Kathleen Grace, a Thornton adjunct instructor, performed “This is Always,” by Betty Carter. Grace said Carter was one of McElhaney’s favorite artists. 
“Vic lives on in the sound of every musician he ever played with,” Grace said. 
Thornton jazz studies percussion lecturer Aaron Serfaty led McElhaney’s Jazz Combo class in performing McElhaney’s own arrangement of the Jackson 5 song “Never Can Say Goodbye.” 
“I never can say goodbye,” the song goes. “Even though the pain and heartache / Seem to follow me wherever I go.” 
McElhaney’s parents, Oakland District 3 Councilwoman Lynette Gibson McElhaney and Clarence McElhaney, were at the memorial. Clarence McElhaney spoke briefly about his son. 
“His first drumset, we had to call ‘night-night drums,’ because he would play them through midnight,” Clarence McElhaney said. “His love was for African drums, the root of all American music … [once], he said he played the drums until his ancestors talked to him.” 
Kirk Franklin, a prominent gospel singer, came to the event to speak after being informed that he was one of McElhaney’s musical idols. 
“These are difficult, painful times,” Franklin said. “When you go to the symphony, at the beginning, the musicians are making a bunch of mess … only when the conductor takes the stage, the mess turns into melody … I still believe all of this is happening because the conductor is about to take stage.” 
Students who knew McElhaney were invited to take the stage to talk about their memories of him. 
David “LAMI” Friebe, who served as co-president of BBB with McElhaney and was also a student at Thornton, described how McElhaney changed the culture of the organization through his leadership. 
Friebe said McElhaney organized events like a screening of the film “Moonlight,” and was unafraid to speak out about his beliefs — McElhaney challenged conservative speaker Ben Shapiro during the Q&A portion of Shapiro’s appearance at USC.
“He had so much impact on our organization,” Friebe said. “He pushed me to be the best person I could be.” 
After speaking, Friebe performed his and McElhaney’s band’s original song “The Circle,” which he had performed with McElhaney in an unreleased music video.
Circles were a theme throughout the event. Speakers mentioned the circles of community created around McElhaney, the representation of drums as circles and the circle of life McElhaney was a part of. 
Nia Warren, co-director of the Black Student Assembly, was a childhood friend of McElhaney, whom she reconnected with seven years later when they both ended up at the same university. 
“You were supposed to be a part of my family forever,” Warren said. “No one challenged me the way Vic did.” 
Sarah Toutant, a CBCSA graduate assistant, performed a spoken word poem she wrote, “The Definition of Drums,” at the memorial. 
“You’re probably in this room right now, critiquing this very gathering because we should’ve worn more color or something,” Toutant said in her poem. 
Fowles and Burklo ended the event by encouraging attendees to speak to people in the room outside of their ‘circles’ about their memories and relationships with McElhaney. 
Senior Director of Student Equity and Inclusion Programs Naddia Palacios helped organize the event, with support from CBCSA, BAA, BSA and the Thornton School. She said she served to collect information from the various organizations to create a communal event honoring McElhaney. 
“We wanted to make sure to celebrate him through his music and provide a space for students to come together,” Palacios said.
McElhaney was 21 when he died March 10. He was approached by three to four suspects around 12:24 a.m. during a possible failed robbery attempt on Maple Avenue and Adams Boulevard, the Los Angeles Police Department said. One of the suspects shot McElhaney, and the suspects fled the scene in a vehicle. An LAPD investigation into the matter is ongoing, and no suspects have been arrested. 
Berkeley-based organization Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency created a GoFundMe fundraising page on behalf of McElhaney’s family. As of Tuesday night, the page has raised over $73,000, surpassing its original $30,000 fundraising goal and its $50,000 stretch goal.
“The light Vic brought into this community meant the community was changed forever,” Warren said.

In British English, a lot of words do not mean what they do to Americans. In our dialect, we say “chips” while they say “crisps.” When we say “fries,” they say “chips.”  
Just as there are differences in British and American English, there are also differences in the lived experiences between East Asians in America and East Asians in Britain. Unclever metaphors aside, I had the great privilege of traveling to Europe during spring break and decided to go to London, a city I’ve always wanted to visit. It was an amazing experience to witness the fusion of new and old architecture and historical sights, along with the vibrant nightlife and welcoming people. It was everything I expected from such an iconic city — except that I was one of the only East Asians.
Now, don’t get me wrong. I didn’t expect to come to London and find myself in a city filled with diversity — I mean, this is still Europe we’re talking about. But I also didn’t expect the sheer lack of Asians in a city that takes pride in being a “melting pot” and is home to a thriving Chinatown. Instead, I was greeted with a city that boasted a large assortment of Asian cuisine but not Asian culture. Restaurants focused on serving authentic Asian cuisine were everywhere, with chains such as Wasabi and Itsu being a dime a dozen. But where were the Asians?
The absence of Asians made me concerned with the distinct differences I felt as an East Asian and more specifically as a Chinese person, in London than I do back home in Los Angeles.                                         
Food can serve as an excellent metaphor (I know, enough with the metaphors!) for the immediate cultural differences I felt between the two cities. In London, Asian food seemed mainstream, palatable. Sushi, pad thai, curry — all these commonplace and inoffensive dishes were available for anyone to enjoy. Instead of McDonald’s and Chipotle, they offered Wasabi and Itsu. Truly “authentic” Asian cuisine was much harder to pin down. It felt like instead of options that were true to my heritage, London’s food scene only offered mainstream choices that appealed to the non-Asian majority. To put it bluntly, London felt far more “whitewashed” than my Southern California hometown. 
In California, there are very few popular chain Asian restaurants that haven’t been Americanized. Instead, there is a plethora of authentic Asian restaurants serving food that may be a bit more exotic to the Western eye. But, of course, not to mine; this is the food I grew up with, this food I love to eat. Although the food may not be as mainstream, it still exists as a culture, as a community. Here, Asian food and culture remains distinctly outside of the white mainstream (for the most part, excluding ramen). London and Los Angeles’ different food scenes are reflections of their different demographic makeups as cities. One is more homogenous yet muddled, while the other more exclusionary yet distinct.
Now, it seems pretty obvious that minorities would have different experiences across cities and countries. But these different experiences are so important to the nuances of fairly and authentically representing Asian American identities. 
I spend a lot of time analyzing and dissecting my own Asian identity and how I interact with the world as a result. Yet I am still only able to do so within the extremely narrow scope of my own experience growing up in Southern California. I was blessed to grow up in communities with substantial Asian populations, but even then, I often felt like an outsider.
Considering there are vast differences between growing up in Southern California and growing up in say, the Bay Area, I can’t even fathom what it would be like to live in the deep South or East Coast or any other region for that matter. And especially not in London or other European cities. 
As I continue to explore the intersections of Asian identity, I realize that I’m extremely limited by the restraints of my own experiences. There’s so much variation within the Asian experience that to even begin covering it all would mean living more lives than I am capable of. Visiting London, even for the short time I did, made me realize how it was arrogant of me to talk about “universal themes” of the Asian experience without taking into consideration the true range of identities that exist across the world. 
Though I won’t discount my own views, I hope to be able to experience more of the world — after all, there’s always something to be learned from new experiences.

Once again, USC administrators responded poorly to a scandal that made national headlines. After the FBI announced the indictments of seven USC employees involved in a college admissions bribery  scheme, the president’s office rushed to release a memo to the USC community asserting —underlined — that “USC is a victim” in this fraud “perpetrated against the university.” 
This reaction makes sense from a public relations standpoint: It sends the message that USC is just as upset as everyone else. However, in labeling itself a victim, USC wrongfully denied fault and dismissed the frustration of the actual victims — students who actually earned their place at USC. 
First, it is important to establish that generally, one’s claim to victimhood decreases as their culpability increases. It was USC employees — institutional representatives of the school — who allegedly assisted in fraudulent activities. It was USC that had lax enough procedures that allowed a student to apply and get admitted through USC athletics, although they had never played the sport they claimed to excel in. 
The affidavit highlights multiple letters of concern sent from high school counselors about questionable acceptances. Those letters were dismissed by USC’s senior athletic administrators. Rightfully, the individuals who participated in the cover-up were fired, but to imply that senior associate athletics director Donna Heinel, who allegedly accepted nearly $1.3 million in bribes, wasn’t acting as an arm of the institution is simply false. A rogue arm, sure, but still connected to the body.
There was also negligence on a larger scale. A student fraudulently admitted to the University as a football recruit attended a high school that didn’t even have a football team. The fact that nobody caught that blatant lie indicates that in the best case scenario, there was widespread ignorance. 
USC’s claim of victimhood is based on the argument that, because the highest levels of the institution were deceived by negligent lower levels of the institution, the University is not just innocent of the crime but a victim of that crime. That’s like the assertion that Chipotle was a victim of the norovirus outbreak spread by its food because Chipotle’s employees didn’t tell the company the food was contaminated before it was distributed. 
The problem with this argument is that it assumes the institution is only represented by the Office of the President. It implies that as long as Interim President Wanda Austin wasn’t aware of the fraud, USC committed no wrongdoing. But that contradicts the point of an institutional hierarchy. It’s top-down, with those on top being at least partially responsible for the conduct of the people below them. USC’s claim of victimhood is dishonest — it dodges responsibility and sends a regressive message that the University could not have done anything to prevent this. 
Furthermore, saying the fraud was “perpetrated against the university” is a flat-out lie. This was a crime perpetrated against honest and low-income people. This was a crime intended to steal the actual merit of those without extraordinary means, and carelessly distribute that hard-earned merit to those who deserved none. Today, there is a large number of people who were denied a USC education because the University helped someone steal it. 
USC missed an opportunity to acknowledge and apologize for its role in perpetuating American elitism, choosing instead to deflect blame onto its accomplices. As students, we are calling for a simple recognition of USC’s role in the corruption and an apology to the innocent people it hurt. The recently released plans to mitigate the crisis are promising, and they are the right thing to do. However, they shouldn’t be built on the deceptive notion that USC couldn’t have done better.

Grégoire Bouillier’s “The Mystery Guest” begins like any noir novel — with the ringing of the telephone jolting its owner awake.  
Except the call doesn’t come in the middle of the night during a raging thunderstorm. It comes in the late afternoon on a gloomy, humid Sunday, while the narrator is taking a nap. And the woman on the other end of the phone is not the mysterious femme fatale; it’s Bouillier’s ex-girlfriend from six years ago, who, after four years with her, got up and left without a warning. Also, the book isn’t fiction — it’s a memoir, though Bouillier purposely leaves ambiguous which elements are true and which have been embellished. 
His girlfriend has called to invite him to be the “mystery guest” at the 37th birthday party of Sophie Calle, a French conceptual artist. Between 1980 and 1993, Calle threw birthday parties and invited the same number of guests as the age she was turning, plus one extra stranger to symbolize the upcoming year of her life. Bouillier’s ex-girlfriend is in charge of procuring the mystery guest this year, and he is the first person she thought of. 
Disoriented from his nap and caught completely off-guard by the sound of her voice, Bouillier immediately agrees to attend. After, he is thrown into turmoil. The call was brief and perfunctory, and she has provided only the time, date and address of the party — no explanation, no professions of guilt or sorrow for her disappearance from the relationship six years prior. He then launches into a tortured soliloquy, a private cri de coeur, one that continues straight up to and throughout the party. 
Even though Bouillier’s ex ignores him for the majority of the party, suffice to say that he finds the closure that he’s looking for. And the only clues she gives him are a bouquet of roses and a line from Virginia Woolf’s “Mrs. Dalloway.” I don’t want to spoil it, but the reasoning behind her dramatic exit is quite genius, and I will be deploying her excuse on all the boys I’ve ever ghosted. (Although the book was published in 2004, and the term “ghosting” had not yet entered the cultural lexicon.) 
“The Mystery Guest” has the flavor of Albert Camus’ “The Stranger.” Both are slim volumes, translated from French, that chronicle the inner monologues of bookish, intellectual, somewhat emo Frenchmen who are largely inclined to take a dim view of life. Bouillier identifies heavily with James Joyce’s “Ulysses,” and Ulysses, the NASA space probe sent to orbit the sun. Absurdist themes are overt. For example, Bouillier resolves to bring, as a gift for Calle, an extremely expensive bottle of Margaux that cost more than his rent. Yet, at the party, an attendee blithely informs him that Calle never opens her birthday presents, preferring instead to display them in a cabinet case as vehicles for her art. 
With its noir tropes and manic first-person narration, “The Mystery Guest” also reminds me greatly of Paul Auster’s “New York Trilogy.” It reads like a detective novel, even though the stakes aren’t quite as high as murder. But who says that finding out why someone broke your heart is less important than finding out who killed your brother? Bouillier peppers his memoir with humor and witticisms, but it is a fundamentally vulnerable book detailing a period of deep emotional distress, and his hurt and suffering are palpable. 
But there is a silver lining to this whole affair: Years later, Bouillier met Calle at a bar and became quite close with her. They became so close, in fact, that when Bouillier dumped her via email in 2007, she distributed the letter to 107 women and deemed it an art piece. Rest assured that what goes around comes around. 
“The Mystery Guest” has something for everyone: noir fans, art enthusiasts and, of course, the unceremoniously dumped.

True crime podcasts have been dominating iTunes charts ever since “Serial” first made waves in 2014. But true crime covers only one genre in the vast world of documentary podcasts. Like “Serial,” documentary podcasts feature one story over multiple episodes but don’t limit themselves to a sole murder or criminal investigation. They immerse listeners into an experience brimming with captivating sound design and detailed reporting on topics like California earthquakes or the history of ISIS. Here are four documentary podcasts to start binging today.
Surviving Y2K 
Part of a series that takes deep dives into cultural touchpoints — a person, event or otherwise — “Surviving Y2K” focuses on how entering the new millenium in 2000 impacted populations worldwide.
Host Dan Taberski addresses the Y2K bug everyone thought would plunge the world to its very end, but what stands out about this podcast are the intertwining narratives that came to a head at the millenium. 
Each episode gets closer to the start of the millenium until the clocks finally strike midnight in the fourth of six episodes, uniting the stories of the race to deliver the first baby of the millenium in Utah, a family who moves to Israel and lives by the Bible and a hostage situation in Kansas on New Year’s Eve. 
Woven throughout the narrative is Taberski’s own experience amid Y2K, a personal story filled with emotion. Taberski is what brings this podcast together — a talented storyteller, he effortlessly crafts each sentence with wit and purpose.
The podcast’s production value also can’t be overstated. Each music choice and every bit of sound design is carefully selected to generate tension, empathy and excitement throughout the scenes. 
“Surviving Y2K” is the second season of the “Headlong” series, which started with Taberski’s “Missing Richard Simmons” in 2017. A new season focusing on a different cultural touchpoint is set to be released this spring.
Making Obama 
This podcast reveals just how essential Chicago was to former President Barack Obama’s ascension into political stardom. Produced by Chicago public radio station WBEZ, the six-episode series covers Obama’s life from the time he arrived in Chicago until his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention — years before he ran for president. 
The podcast is brought together by an interview with Obama himself. Host Jenn White’s reporting skills extract details from Obama’s life and the countless other interviews she conducts for the series. She uncovers aspects of Obama’s past you wouldn’t find anywhere else. She illustrates his experience in Chicago by coaxing her interviewees to tell descriptive stories that make the listener feel like they were present in the moment. 
“Making Obama” is by no means a vaulting praise of Obama, as most post-presidency narratives often turn out to be. Throughout the series, he’s portrayed as something of an overly idealistic political novice at the beginning of his career, struggling to find his own voice in a city too cynical to welcome him. 
If anything, the podcast is a vaulting praise of Chicago itself — the community let down its initial guard, and the years Obama spent in Chicago as a community organizer ultimately  shaped him into a winning politician and president of the United States.
The Big One
This podcast from Los Angeles’ own KPCC is particularly attuned to Southern California listeners. Not only does the podcast delve into the scientific backing behind a massive earthquake that could hit California at any moment, but it also acts as a form of service journalism, instructing Angelenos on how they can prepare to survive the impending calamity.
Hosted by KPCC science reporter Josh Margolis, the series opens with an imaginative scenario that should hit close to home for Trojans. He sets the scene: An Angeleno gives their order to a barista when, suddenly, the “big one” hits. 
Even though the series can become muddled with complex scientific concepts, Margolis’ narration paints a vivid picture for the listener, focusing on explaining the tangible effects listeners would feel in the event of an earthquake.
This is bolstered with beautiful, expertly executed sound design in each episode. There’s the use of vibrating string instruments, sound effects like enhanced echoes and soft rumbles, but there’s also moments of extended silence. And they all serve to highlight just how devastating a massive earthquake could be and lend listeners moments to reflect on how they would personally be affected. 
It’s a great podcast for anyone, but it’s almost a necessary listen for Southern Californians — the podcast gives guidance for how to prepare for such an earthquake, explaining the survival tools and emergency plans that’ll make living through a destroyed Los Angeles a little bit easier. 
Caliphate
From the start, The New York Times’ “Caliphate” is both captivating and cinematic. The reporting of seasoned journalist Rukmini Callimachi, who plays more of a main character role than a host as she delves into her reporting process with producer Andy Mills, forms the backbone of the narrative. 
Callimachi explores three related stories in the the 10-episode series: the tale of an escaped ISIS recruit, a look into Mosul — a major Iraqi city held by the Islamic State — and an arresting investigation into ISIS’ practice of sexually enslaving young girls. 
The details are horrific and verge on unbearable, but they present the most honest and unflinching picture of modern terrorism. Callimachi is something of a superwoman in the series; she’s unafraid to confront the most daunting situations in her reporting and is always calm and collected. Yet, as the main voice in the podcast, she’s engaging and emotional, and she explains complex ongoings in the world of ISIS in brilliantly simple ways, such as comparing an ISIS financial ledger to any ordinary American’s credit card statement. 
“Caliphate” is raw and showstopping. Listeners who hear the show while doing chores or other menial tasks will find themselves pausing in their tracks — so deeply engrossed in the spellbinding narrative that they’re pulled away from whatever else they’re doing. 
The documentary series is The New York Times’ first narrative podcast, displaying the capacity the dominant newspaper has to create wonderfully produced, riveting shows rooted in their expert reporters’ years of experience covering a single topic.
