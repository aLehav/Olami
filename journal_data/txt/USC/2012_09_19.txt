Every Tuesday through Thursday morning, USC coach Lane Kiffin meets with media members following football practice, first summarizing the day’s session and then fielding a handful of questions.

But Kiffin abruptly ended his interview on Wednesday after roughly 28 seconds in response to a question about a previously injured player’s return to practice.
“Really good practice today,” said Kiffin to begin the media session at Howard Jones Field. “I thought the offense came out and was really crisp in both the running game and the passing game.”
In response to his opening statement, a reporter asked whether Kiffin thought the improved offensive performance was a “function” of the injured player’s return to practice in preparation for Saturday’s game against California.
“I don’t know,” Kiffin replied.
Midway through the next question about senior safety T.J. McDonald’s pass-rushing role against Stanford last Saturday, Kiffin simply said, “I gotta go,” brushed past a handful of reporters and jogged away.
He did not speak with the media further.
USC instituted a new policy in August preventing credential media members from reporting injury-related news they observe during practice. Citing the competitive disadvantage those reports create, Kiffin has also instructed his players not to comment on their respective injuries.
Last week, Scott Wolf, a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily News, had his USC football media credentials revoked for two weeks after he reported sophomore kicker Andre Heidari had undergone knee surgery and would be sidelined for three weeks.
Heidari had not played in the team’s Sept. 8 game against Syracuse in East Rutherford, N..J.
Upon appeal, the ban was lifted, and the reporter was reinstated two days later.
“I apologize if that was taken the wrong way,” Kiffin said last Thursday following Wolf’s reinstatement. “We viewed it differently. There’s not necessarily a right or wrong. The editors and our people are going to try and get together so you people can do your job the best you can and also for us not [to compromise] a competitive advantage. I know it’s not exactly the best thing for you, but we’re also trying to protect our team, too.”
 
Joey Kaufman contributed to this report.
So how much longer will USC put up with coach Kiffin’s immaturity and arrogance?  Do you have to?  You don’t win respect or games through any means other than poise, humility, and professionalism.  Sponsors and benefactors will eventually figure out he’s not “optimal” for the job…it’s just a matter of an imminent, to-be-determined faux pas to gain national attentio.  Sadly it will also drag SC down until his departure.
[…] is the mysteriously stricken from the record question that causes Kiffin to hightail it? Reports say it was regarding an injured player that returned to practice Wednesday. Kiffin’s added some […]

As the USC players pushed their way through the throng of Cardinal fans on the Stanford Stadium field after the clock hit 0:00 Saturday night, the thousands of Trojan fans who made the trek north to Palo Alto were racing their way to the parking lot as quickly as they could.
Each group was most likely thinking the same thing: How could this happen?
This 2012 version was supposed to be the best team in the nation, the team to put USC back atop its perch. But on that night, USC looked like anything but. The supposedly best offense in college football was beaten down, held to just 14 points and shut out in the second half. A loss like this was unheard of.
Or was it?
As many have correctly pointed out, slip-ups like this have become the norm for top-ranked USC teams. Very rarely do teams go undefeated, and USC, highly-touted though they may be, is no different.
Think back to 2003, when the No. 3 Trojans suffered a week-four loss to California. Or in 2006, when a pair of upsets at Oregon State and UCLA knocked them out of the BCS national title game. The next season, USC was at the receiving end of one of the biggest upsets in college football history when the team lost at home to a struggling Stanford team in former Cardinal coach Jim Harbaugh’s first season.
But it doesn’t stop there. In 2008, USC again lost at Oregon State, its lone blemish that season. And last season, the stunner came in Tempe when the team lost to a 6-7 Arizona State squad.
And what do these teams all have in common? With the exception of last year’s team, which was ineligible to compete in a bowl game, each of the teams that suffered unexpected losses bounced back to win the Rose Bowl. And last season, the Trojans finished ranked No. 6 in the final Associated Press top-25 poll.
The point of all this is simple: One loss does not have to derail a season.  Troy is in peril right now. Everyone is still in a state of shock. But the key is that the people who matter, the players and the coaches, snap out of that haze and refocus in a hurry.
In the past, they have done just that. Former coach Pete Carroll’s success is well documented. But current coach Lane Kiffin, who was part of Carroll’s staff, showed resilience last season in recovering from the early season loss to the Sun Devils. After stumbling through an uninspiring win at home to lowly Arizona, the team rattled off impressive road victories at California and Notre Dame, with both its offense and defense clearly finding their stride after looking inept against Arizona State.
And all this is not taking into consideration the determination of senior quarterback Matt Barkley. Already one of the all-time Trojan greats, Barkley was one of the main reasons the experts picked USC to run the table. Now, after one of the worst games of his career, it will have to be the driving force to right the ship after such a disappointing letdown.
One of the cruxes going into this season was the perceived small margin for error USC had. That margin is now considerably even smaller. And with several Pac-12 teams exceeding preseason expectations, another loss seems like a more imminent threat. But the tough schedule also provides an opportunity for the team to add marquee victories to its BCS resume, as well as regain its confidence when it has been understandably shaken.
Since declaring they had “unfinished business,” Barkley and his teammates have planned on having the perfect season, which included going undefeated en route to the national championship. Now, the plan has changed, but the motivation doesn’t have to. This team still has business to take care of. Every goal set out at the beginning of the season is still attainable, albeit the challenges might now be a little steeper.
But the questions still linger: Will the offensive line improve? Was Barkley merely the victim of a bad night or is it something more? Can the running game re-establish itself after being rendered insignificant?
Time will tell whether or not the Trojans can correct these mistakes. But fans should take comfort in knowing that the program is in the right hands to recover from such a crushing blow.
And come Saturday, against a Cal team fresh off a near upset at Ohio State, we should see answers to these questions.

Every once in a while, an athlete comes along who defies the limits of athletic achievement. An athlete who mesmerizes others in his sport and not only reaches greatness, but blows past it to become something more: legendary. Success comes so easily, it seems like the athlete’s reign of dominance will never end.

Until it does.
This is where the really interesting part begins: How do you replace such a legend?
When superstar goalie Joel Dennerley graduated after last season, the USC men’s water polo team was faced with this question.
Dennerley led the Trojans to the greatest run in NCAA water polo history: four consecutive NCAA championships, three All-America selections, two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year awards and one Peter J. Cutino Award as the nation’s top player — the first time a goalie has ever won the award.
Dennerley is USC’s all-time leader in saves and a national hero in his native Australia, where he was named the Player of the Year by Australia Water Polo Inc. and competed for the country in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
With accolades like that, USC coach Jovan Vavic was faced with one of the biggest challenges of his career in choosing Dennerley’s successor.
But after working through summer camp and early season games, it turns out that the best way to replace a legend might be by committee.
During last weekend’s NorCal tournament, redshirt sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla, 20, and junior goalie James Clark, 21, each played two games.
Both played well, as evidenced by the team’s last two wins of the tournament: a 10-9 victory over No. 4 Stanford with Bonilla playing, and a 7-6 win over No. 2 UCLA in the championship with Clark in the cage.
“We both had a good tournament this weekend,” Bonilla said. “You’re always happy with the wins.”
Vavic was also pleased with the efforts of the young goalies.
“Our goalies were excellent,” he said. “We are fortunate that we can really rely on them extensively.”
So far, everything is at peace. The two compete with each other each day for playing time, but Vavic maintains he isn’t in a hurry to deviate from the two-goalie system.
Each goalie has the pedigree to be a star, Vavic insists. In fact, the Trojans’ 18-year coach believes that his duo might be even more physically gifted than Dennerley.
“They are both long and very quick, and I think that is their biggest strength,” Vavic said of Bonilla and Clark. “They have very strong legs, and I think both of them have stronger legs than [Dennerley]. That allows them to get up higher out of the water and stay up for a longer period of time.”
In addition to their physical strengths, Bonilla and Clark have another thing in common: both have been Dennerley’s back-up.
Bonilla spent two years on the bench for USC, playing sparingly in games, waiting for the opportunity to make a real impact on the team.
And Clark, though only in his first year at USC, is no stranger to backing up the all-time great: he was Dennerley’s backup on the Australian national team this past summer in London.
While each player was an understudy to Dennerley, both took advantage of the opportunity to work alongside one of the world’s best goalies.
“The biggest thing I’ve gathered from [Dennerley] is his dedication and time he puts into the sport,” Clark said. “He shows that, along with the ability, it also takes a lot of time and effort to become not just a good player but a great player.”
Bonilla also developed a great respect for Dennerley’s work ethic and is now fully aware of the task that faces him.
“I’ve got some big shoes to fill,” Bonilla said. “I’ve learned a lot from [Dennerley] the past two years, a lot of preparation techniques. Now I’m just trying to use everything I’ve learned from him and the coaches to play to the best of my abilities.”
Vavic understands that despite his best efforts, Bonilla and Clark are going to face endless comparisons to the Trojan great.
But he praises the two for their patience and insists they are ready to play large roles in this season’s success, likening their situation to one several USC quarterbacks have faced in the past.
“[Bonilla] is in his third year, so he has been really patient in waiting for his opportunity,” Vavic said. “James Clark is a new player for us, so for him this is new territory. If you compare our team with our football team, they had [Carson] Palmer, [Matt] Leinart. They had these great quarterbacks who waited for their opportunity, and we are no different.”
For now, the duo is perfectly content with sharing the role, and Vavic is confident that their time on the bench will pay off.
“We have great players who patiently wait for their opportunity and now they are ready to shine,” Vavic said.

In a battle for L.A. supremacy, No. 2 USC women’s volleyball took down No. 1 UCLA 3-1 at the Galen Center on Wednesday night. Though the Women of Troy started slow out of the gate, they more than made up for it with a blistering fourth set in which they outscored a talented Bruins team 25-17.
Rivalry debut · Freshman Samantha Bricio is officially a veteran after squaring off against No. 1 UCLA and delivering 19 kills on .260 hitting. The 6-foot-2 outside hitter has a wealth of international experience, having competed for Mexico’s Senior National Team. at age 16. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Led by freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who finished with a career-high 19 kills to go along with seven aces, USC dominated every facet of the match. The Women of Troy shined at the net where freshman Alicia Ogoms and sophomore Alexis Olgard used their superior height to control the battle upfront, posting four combined blocks.
“That’s why we inserted [Ogoms] into the lineup,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “I knew we needed size against the Bruins to slow down their big girls — and when I say slow down, I mean that’s all we could do. They’ll be ready next time when we go over there and it should be fun.”
Bricio started out a little cold in the first set with only four kills, but broke out in the second set and stayed hot after that. Whether she was hitting from the outside or from the back row, the Mexico native looked and played like a veteran.
“I was a little nervous, but then I just went out there and starting playing, “ Bricio said. “I felt good because I had the support of my teammates around me.”
Setting her the ball was sophomore Hayley Crone, who did an outstanding job distributing the ball with 53 assists on the night. Like any great setter, Crone fed the hot hand all night, whether it was Bricio, senior Katie Fuller or junior Sara Shaw, and even displayed great court awareness with four dinks for points.
“We played awesome defense, and you really have to give credit to Natalie [Hagglund] for digging all those balls down the line,” Crone said. ”I was able to read the blocks and just put the ball in the spots I needed to.”
USC fell down 12-15 early in the first set, but Crone fed Olgard for an easy kill and the comeback was on. Behind senior opposite Katie Fuller, who had seven kills in the match, the Women of Troy refused to yield and Olgard came away with another big kill to tie the match at 23 apiece. After the two teams traded kills, USC would capitalize on UCLA’s missed opportunities including a hit out of bounds to take the set 28-26.
Maintaining the momentum from the last set, USC jumped out to an early 6-1 lead. Following a UCLA timeout, it turned into the Samantha Bricio show, as the freshman had four kills in a span of seven points to put the Women of Troy up 14-9.
UCLA outside hitter Tabi Love, who was a force all day, took hold of the set with back-to-back kills to keep the Bruins’ hopes alive.
But, Bricio put USC up for good with three successive kills. A Crone-to-Fuller connection ended the set with USC coming out on top 25-20.
“Katie [Fuller] is our workhorse, and if you look it up she actually had more kills than Bricio [she had 21 tying a career high]. Even though she got tired at the end, any time we needed a big hit she was there, “ Haley said.
In the third set, Bricio continued to dominate from the back row early on, but with the score knotted at seven, UCLA seized control of the momentum. Behind the stellar play of Love and fellow senior Rachael Kidder, who had a team-high 18 kills, the Bruins kept a one-point lead all the way to the finish. With USC and UCLA trading kills, mostly from Bricio and Fuller, the momentum stayed with the Bruins. Even after Hayley Crone set a winner over on two to pull USC into a 21-all tie, UCLA’s Love hit three kills in the last six points to push the Bruins to a 26-24 victory.
In the fourth and final set, both teams came out strong with the score tied at five apiece. With Bricio in full force and Fuller starting to heat up again, the Women of Troy forced UCLA to start pressing and the game turned after an early stalemate. Once USC went up 12-7 in the middle of the set, the Bruins couldn’t overcome several unforced errors and the outstanding serves by USC proved too much to handle. A block by Olgard fittingly sealed the match at 25-17.

The USC Marshall School of Business announced Wednesday a new program that will allow a group of 45 undergraduates to earn degrees from three universities and study on three different continents over the course of four years.

The World Bachelor in Business program was created through a partnership between USC, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. Students will spend one full academic year at each of the three universities and may choose one of the schools to spend their fourth year. The program will be available to students who are applying for fall admission but not current students.
HKUST was named the top university in Asia by QS Asian University Rankings, and Bocconi University is internationally renowned for its business and economics programs. In general, the program will focus on world business and communication in multiple languages.
According to John Matsusaka, vice dean for faculty and academic affairs at Marshall, the WBB program is the first of its kind.
“There really is no one in the world doing anything like this, where you can go to three places and get three degrees in the three major economic and cultural zones of the world,” he said.
Matsusaka said the idea for the program was born out of a 2009 conversation about the future of higher education with a friend who worked at Bocconi. Each presented the idea to their own universities, and eventually, the two institutions came together to find an Asian partner.
Once all three schools were onboard, representatives from the universities participated in a series of meetings to outline the details of the program, including admission guidelines, scholarship awards and the process of transferring credits. All the schools have a similar “Western-style” of teaching, according to Matsusaka, which will allow for a seamless transition from school to school for students.
“Students will get three degrees, but no school is compromising,” Matsusaka said. “There is some flexibility, but the entire curriculum will fit together. Part of the reason we wanted to do this is that we wanted to experiment.”
Students who apply to enter the program before their freshman year must be simultaneously accepted to all three universities, which will jointly decide who is admitted to the program.
“There’s a big difference between treading about another country, visiting as a tourist, and actually living there,” Matsusaka said. “There is no substitute for being immersed in the culture, but this experience is not for every student. It’s for a student who’s a bit adventurous, forward-looking and ambitious.”

Experts discussed possible resolutions to the nuclear conflict between the United States and Iran at an event hosted by the USC Center on Public Policy on Wednesday in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

The event, “The Iran Project: A U.S.-Iran Public Diplomacy Road Map,” focused on the challenging diplomacy issues in the context of the current United States-Iran relationship.
The bipartisan panel featured USC Professor Philip Seib and members of The Iran Project, a non-governmental organization that issued a comprehensive report on potential solutions to the conflict between the United States and Iran. Ambassador William H. Leurs, Ambassador Frank G. Wisner and Admiral Eric T. Olson were representatives of the project.
The speakers highlighted some of the key themes of the report, particularly the need for people within the United States to have rational discussions about the United States’ relationship with Iran.
“Politicians and others who are to quick on the draw need a reality check, and that’s what this report provides,” Seib said.
To this end, Wisner encouraged those in attendance to think about Iran in terms of the events that affect the Middle East and how this affects U.S. interests.
“As you begin thinking about Iran, think about it in context,” Wisner said. “We are not just dealing with a nuclear question, or a threat to Israel, we are dealing with a new significant strategic reality with which the United States cannot afford not to be engaged in.”
The Iran Project has worked to find political and diplomatic solutions to the conflict, including working behind the scenes with both governments to promote direct talks and help interpret communications. Members have also engaged in “Track II” diplomacy, in which non-officials work to create dialogue and build trust between the two nations.
A summary of their findings, which is published in the small booklet “Weighing Benefits and Costs of Military Action Against Iran,” lists the pros and cons of military attack against the Iran.
The panel also highlighted national issues in Iran, geographic and economic interests, the United States commitment to Israel and Iran’s ability to impact the U.S. interests.
This region factors into our most important national interest because of its huge and extraordinary holdings of hydrocarbons,” Wisner said.
The panel then shifted to discussing the possibility of military action against Iran. All members were largely opposed to military action; instead, they encouraged diplomacy and respect for each country’s national interest.
“We have to recognize Iran as its own reality — its own government,” Wisner said.
Seib said he hopes students leave the panel with a new appreciation of the complexities of the U.S.-Iran relationship.
“I hope there is a recognition of the complexity of issues concerning Iran specifically, and the questions of war and piece generally,” Seib said.

The freshmen class of 2016 has fewer international students and more females than last year’s class, according to the 2012-13 Freshman Profile and Admission Information, released by USC’s Office of Admissions on Monday.
Other differences between this year’s and past profiles include an increase in applicants, which rose from 37,210 to 46,104 students, as well as a decreased yield, from 34 to 33 percent.
Students and the admissions office attribute the greater number of applicants for spaces in the 2012-13 freshmen class to USC’s transition to the Common Application, an undergraduate college admissions application that gives students one succinct application platform for more than 400 universities.
Kirk Brennan, USC’s dean of Undergraduate Admission, said that the increased applicant pool can be explained by the rising prestige of the university.
“We had more applicants because of a combination of factors,” Brennan said. “USC is earning recognition among students. The university is gaining superstar status.”
Some freshmen, like philosophy, politics and law major Paige Schwimmer, see USC’s reputation as the main cause for the rise in number of applicants.
“It’s everyone’s first time applying to college, so the ease of the Common App versus the old system doesn’t affect us,” Schwimmer said.
The profile also details an increase in the number of high schools represented.
International diversity, however, fell slightly among students in this year’s freshman class. International representation dropped from 15 to 10 percent of the overall incoming class.
“Unfortunately, nobody can deny that the events of April 11 had an impact on our international students,” said Brennan, referring to the off-campus deaths of two USC students in April. “Though these incidents are isolated, they may not seem so to international families.”
Competition might have also been a factor in the smaller amount of international students in the freshman class.
“We compete for some of the top students in the world,” Brennan said.
“USC is becoming more attractive to students, and the university is doing a great job of reaching out to them to self-perpetuate themselves. There is more interest in USC every single year,” said freshman Bob Overing, a communications major.
The admissions office released a statement on their website following the profile, noting that “Most [USC] freshmen come from the top 10 percent of their high school class. USC receives applications from every state in the U.S. and almost one hundred countries, resulting in an unusually bright, talented and diverse student body.”
more chicks, fewer asians? hell yeah

After a rise in emergency medical transports, physical conflicts and loud noise at parties on The Row, the fraternity and sorority presidents on the Inter-Fraternity and Panhellenic Councils voted unanimously to enact a three-week social probation for its chapters, according to IFC President Michael Madden. The ban, effective immediately, is scheduled to end Oct. 7.
Probation · Presidents of fraternities and sororities voted to enact a temporary social probation as they institute new-member education, the Inter-Fraternity and Panhellenic Councils announced Wednesday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
During the probation, the organizations are planning to create new-member programming that focuses on preventing sexual assault, alcohol and physical altercations, Madden said.
“We are looking to partner up with other on-campus organizations and collaborate with them to educate our members,” Madden said.
In a letter to IFC and Panhellenic members, Madden and Panhellenic Council President Megan Lambert wrote that the probation was self-imposed to avoid further sanctions from the university, which expressed concern about recent incidents.
“The administration is considering a zero-tolerance policy regarding our weeknight social events moving forward,” the letter said. “In effort to avoid this outcome, the Greek leadership created proactive measures to address these issues.”
Beth Saul, assistant dean for student affairs and director for fraternity and sorority leadership development and parent programs, said she is hopeful that the probation is effective and the administration does not have to seek further recourse.
“We hope this period will better educate our members about their social responsibility and prevent any future incidents,” Saul wrote in an email.
Saul did not comment about what other actions the university might take should the probation not be successful.
With a large freshman class, Dept. of Public Safety Captain David Carlisle said there has been more activity on The Row this semester.
“This year, there seems to be greater activity on The Row, so we are spending a lot more time up there,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle said there have also been more medical transports to hospitals this year. DPS has recorded more than 20 hospital transports this year compared to 14 at the same point last year, Carlisle said.
The self-imposed ban prohibits all social events except those registered with the university, such as invites, exchanges, philanthropies and registered weekend parties.
“The Presidents voted and agreed to suspend all official social events, both at fraternity houses and at annex houses [half-way houses], for the next three weeks, ending on October 7th,” Madden and Lambert wrote in the letter. “In addition, the presidents voted not to hold off-campus social events, including bar tabs at the 9-0 Bar and Grill.”
Carlisle said that when DPS devotes so many resources to The Row, it distracts from the department’s other security responsibilities.
“DPS would prefer that the leaders of the Greek community police themselves,” Carlisle said. “We would prefer to be reducing theft, reducing robberies and focusing on crime rather than focusing on social events that get out of control on The Row, uninvited guests or underage drinking.”
Both DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department have increased their enforcement of The Row, Madden said.
LAPD’s senior lead officer for the USC area did not respond to a call for comment.
Madden said he is confident that the probation will achieve its goals.
“We are very hopeful and optimistic that we are going to get through this and that the programming is going to be successful,” he said.
There is a reason why guys join frats – it is a way for them to guarantee their terrible, egomaniacal personalities can still yield friends and the endless nights of drunken sorority girls too drunk and ashamed to protest the morning after the party. Congrats parents of 28th St students – your kids will most likely get an STD by Easter!
If we suppose Ras’ observations are correct, several concerns arise. There may be a relatively greater degree of self and other injurious behavior occurring on the Row than elsewhere on campus. If so, what are the implications? Some would argue that personal choice in how to have “fun” needs to be respected.
1.The Row culture does have implication for the university as a whole as this news story indicated. LAPD and university security resources are diverted away from protecting everyone when their presence is disproportionally needed on the Row.
2. A question to consider as USC cracks the ranks of top universities is “is the Row culture at USC in keeping with that at other top universities”? Put another way is it possible the current Row culture will hinder USC’s rise to the top”. The best and the brightest want to have fun, but likely want a lively social Greek scene consistent with the values and personal choices for fun made by those at other top tier universities. 
3. While USC has many clubs and organizations and a beautiful new campus center, other news stories have pointed out the limited programming and use of the campus center for student activities. There needs to be options for students to socialize, eat, relax in the later evening during the week and until the wee hours on weekends.
Two suggestions:
1. A careful review of the Row culture and attempt bring it in line with USC’s current stature if that is deemed necessary and desirable.
2. Establish programming/activities and food/entertainment availability at the campus center to provide an alternative to the Row for week night and weekend socializing on campus for all to enjoy.
Gaye,
Where do you get off?  Your critique of Row culture is getting old.
Someday you may work for me and I will show you how to tie that neck tie just right…
Hey ’48 and SCmom,
You two (or one in the same) are most creative and entertaining. Thanks for helping me illustrate my concerns about the Row and its negative impact on our USC. 
To TrojanSig ’48 especially, Fight On!?
With all due respect SC Mom w/Greek Son…You are starting to sound a lot like a smart(ass) Greek impersonating Church Lady to further snow a bewildered, passive admin the Greeks seem to have over a barrel. Likely lots of laughs and back slapping right now.
It is highly unlikely a nice Church Lady like you would refer to “second and third tier” houses. That kind of stratification in the eyes of the Lord in unnecessary and a true church lady would not want to make someone feel bad. Nope, that is more Row talk. If I am wrong, please pray for me. Fun while it lasted guys, but pretty snarky.
Gabriel,
I can assure you I am real any suggestion I am not is hurtful.  I am aware of the various tiers of the row only through my son.  I can’t tell you which fraternity belongs in what tier other than my sons house is considered the top house and has been for generations.  With a name like Gabriel I would assume you come from a Christian home.  Let me remind you to “Not judge lest you be judged”.
God Bless!
Gabriel,
Let me tell you a thing or two about who built this University.  It wasn’t people like you.  It was fraternity men like John ’55 and yes, yours truly.  Take your Occupy movement to a state funded school and let us do things here the Trojan way.  I also think SC Mom with a Greek Son is right on the money.  I have a strong inclination that her son joined the same great fraternity that I did.  We don’t have to apologize for success.
In hoc signo vinces
You guys are living in a dream world. This has got to be a joke.
Hey Disgusted,
These 2 guys posting are well into their 80’s. Their “war stories” drinking at USC 60+ years ago give a perspective on how their children brought University of Spoiled Children infami to USC, probably from listening to “glory days” stories from parents like this. Well, the herd is thinning, but now we seem to have a current generation of progeny at USC with the same mentality, just morphed to the current “betches” and bro iteration.
The Row is living in a displaced era that ended long ago and does not fit a surging upwardly ranked top 25 university–quite an anachronism! 
Maybe a values and intellect reassignment program might help (sarcasm–in case someone is not aware of gender reassignment programs).
Gabriel,
I see you took out your Thesaurus and found a collection of fancy pants words to weave into your latest scribe.  I may be 80 something, but I will still kick your dandy butt.  You name the place and time. I have had just about enough of you.
I am going to pray that Gabriel finds the truth as he matures and gains respect for those that came before and provided all that is plenty upon this earth.
God Bless!
Mr. ’48,
I want you to know the following letter has been emailed and faxed to various leaders and administrators at USC.  I am deeply sorry for the rudeness and disrespect “Gabriel” has shown to you and other special members of the USC community.  Thank you for your service to USC and our Nation.  God Bless!
Daily Trojan Staff and USC Administrators:
I think you need to be made aware of the malicious poster to your Daily Trojan website.  He goes by the name “Gabriel”.   However, I don’t believe that is his real name.   He has offended not only me and my son (a current student and member of the Greek community) but generations of USC alumni, war veterans and many potential donors to the University.   Much like the man who made the offensive video for which our President blames for much of the unrest in the Middle East, this “Gabriel” has caused irreparable harm to USC through his postings to your website.  I respectfully request you remove all his postings from your site before additional persons see them and become further offended.   I don’t know if it is possible but likely he should be banned from future postings to your site.   I believe in free speech and the unique responsibility our forefathers placed upon us that said speech elevates the human condition for the benefit all.  “Gabriel’s” speech does nothing to elevate but only hurt others.
I want thank you in advance for your prompt action in this matter.   I have also forward this letter to Mr Nikias and Beth Saul both of whom I am familiar with and speak with regularly.   I am sure they will agree upon further review that what I am requesting is not only reasonable but necessary to protect the image of USC on the internet.
Thank you and God Bless!
GFW
Concerned Parent
SC Mom,
We got your latest letter.  Many of us are out of town for the next few weeks at the WCGL conference in Phoenix, so it may be a while before I can issue a formal response.  Rest assured we will investigate.  Offensive and/or hurtful comments have no place in the respectful and tolerant community we are building here at USC.  Thanks again for all you do.
BS from GL
Dear SC Mom,
I most certainly apologize to you and ’48 for assuming from your postings you were not real. An 80 year old man posting he wants to kick someone’s butt and the postings you have provided are well beyond the norm.  My posts, part in jest, are written specifically to protect the image of USC as a rapidly rising university with a clearly articulated vision and plan well on its way to being a top university. A dialogue seems to be needed regarding the activities and role of USC Greek life in furthering this vision,  not impeding it. Events of late on the Row seem to be rekindling and justifying the damaging USC image as a “party school”. Hopefully, the dialogue will move from playful banter to university-wide discussion at all levels.
Gabriel,
I most certainly accept your sincere apology.   I am hopeful that my contacting the University does not lead back to you getting in serious trouble.   They have already informed me they have identified your user ip (whatever that is).  If so, I apologize for what may happen to you.
My father was a severely wounded Korean War Vet and I have the utmost respect for the men and women that protect us daily from the those that wish to harm us.   Those people deserve the respect of all of us for what they have done to keep American free. The World has unfortunately become a dangerous place for Americans and those of us that practice our faith openly.  It is sad but true that words now can invoke violence.  Mocking someone’s faith publicly is also a form of violence for which we all must resist.
I hope that you grow and mature into a forthright man of honor and integrity.  I hope that someday you might meet my son so he might minister to you the faith for which he so strongly believes.  
God Bless!
Dear SCMom,
I am not sure how you see what I wrote as a reflection upon Korean War Veterans. Several posters glorified excessive drinking. I commented upon the negative impact at this point in history of excessive drinking and often associated behaviors on USC students and the university as a whole. USC is undergoing much rapid change in academic stature. What was acceptable, if not desirable, student behavior at one point in history, may no longer be given the direction of USC’s growth, current laws and student health concerns. I expect the majority of alumni, donors and students support and encourage the increasing stature of USC and its student body.
You obviously don’t understand the concept of “quit while your ahead”.
Reading all these comments, it seems time to “proudly” ban together and sing a chorus of University of Spoiled Children with Nikias conducting. 
I think there is a lot more to USC than the out of control Greek social behavior, but that is what overshadow all campus social life. We seem to be heading in the wrong direction. It is no wonder many outside USC don’t recognize us as the accomplished university we claim to be.
To 9-0 Lover:  Let me clarify what I meant about the fake ID’s at the 9-0:
I’m not so sure that they are “fake”, but they are not legit. Let me explain. I know of many kids (I say “kids” because they are still TEENAGERS of 18 and 19 years of age) who have out of state ID’s with their real name and picture, and then a bogus address, etc.  They work under the scanning light, etc.  Even though many of these kids do not even remotely look 21 or 22, they get in because their fake ID’s pass.  Seriously, the 9-0 staff MUST know about this!  Come on!
So to all of you oblivious parents out there of new freshmen and of sophomores (esp if they are in the greek system), take a peek into your kids wallet and I betcha you will find a very impressive looking fake with your kids name and picture!
I, too, am an oldie but goody (I’m in my early 50’s!!)…What I want to ask is “where have all the beer kegs gone”?.  In my day socials revolved around a beer keg and a sticky floor of a rec room.  It was pretty hard to get alcohol poisoning from drinking keg beer.  Today, kids drink the hard stuff with the only goal of getting wasted.   The quicker the better.  Sorority girls do it and the fraternity men provide much of the booze.  Also, seems everyone on that row has a fake ID and the 9-0 is mindfully oblivious.  Someone is going to die on that row from alcohol misuse. SCARY SCARY SCARY.  USC’s problem seems to be worse than the regular college trends.  Every event must include heavy drinking.  Why not have some sober fun events??  Maybe you will even remember who you talked to!  Good Luck USC.  Until the row cleans up it’s act and image, USC will continue to maintain the image of being less interested in academics and more interested in money and socializing.
@ Carolyn:
I happen to know for a fact that the USC administration loves the 9-0 and how well the places is professionally managed.   Anyone who thinks people with fake ids get into 9-0 is simply wrong.    Door staff have some of the most sophisticated id checking equipment on the market.  You can try but you aren’t getting through that door without a valid id!
Ha ha,
Well we now know who work for the 9-0. Ignorance is bliss on the part of the 9-0 and admin!
Simply not true. I know for a fact that many underage students get into the 9-0 regularly with fake ids.
Here, here!
Somebody needs to stand up fraternity men like my son who is a gentleman and not part of these row shenanigans.  My son is a sophomore and joined the top fraternity at USC last year.   The year prior, my son graduated from the best Christian school in Orange County and many of his friends joined the same fraternity who I will not name but I am certain everyone knows.   Coming from a Christian school, he was both unaccustomed and frankly shocked by the behavior of the girls he has met from the apparent top sororities at USC.   From what he has told me, not one of these girls he has met in the last year is the slightest bit a lady.  These girls openly ask for alcohol or drugs and sometimes bring drugs to the fraternity members for their mutual use.   Sex is apparently as causal as handshake for most of these girls.  I am ashamed for these girls and their sororities who apparently support this behavior.  I have had several conversations with Greek Affairs staff at USC regarding my son’s concerns and apparently action is going start taking place in the near future.   Nevertheless, my son and I pray for all members of fraternities and sororities at USC and we hope they find the truth in “His Word” and turn away from this sinful behavior!
Takes 2 to tango. The “men” in the fraternities are just as bad as the sorority girls, if not worse. Tell me, are the frat guys turning down the drugs and sex that the girls are supposedly offering?!? I think not — give me a break. The whole scene on The Row is a disgrace to USC, and both the boys and girls are to blame. Wake up SC Mom!
Sir or Madam:
Yes, I agree it takes two to tango.  However, my son and his close friends in his fraternity are not doing drugs and having sex with random hussie sorority girls.   Not everyone on the row is without morals and character as you imply.   My son knows the Bible cover to cover and can repeat any section you want to hear.   Not only does he know the holy scripture word for word but he knows the meaning of every verse.   We talk often and he tells me of the difficulty in finding a woman of character and true morals in any of the top sororities at USC.
Throughout history men have often did and said terrible things in the interest of attracting sinful women.  This is a fact of life and women of this generation often use their sexuality to get things from men as did Eve temp Adam in the Garden.    These sorority girls have unfortunately turned their souls over to the master of darkness and sin by doing this.   We all must pray that they may find the “Light of Lord” somewhere within their wretched sinful lives and turn away from their sorority masters to find the eternal love that “He” gives upon all that believe!
Oh, those poor, innocent frat boys. What a joke!
You obviously don’t know my son and his friends.  We will pray for you as well Mr. Disgusted.
Hi, as a current student I understand your concern. I would like to say as a Freshman involved in greek I have met both ladies and guys who maintain their religious and moral values. I’ve been to other colleges such as SDSU, UCSB, Berkeley, Boulder, and Chapman. They’re all the same. There are always going to be heavy drinkers, drug users, and promiscuous girls. 
Any college campus is going to have these girls and guys you have described. I am not religious myself, but one of my best friends is. She chose to go to a deeply religious school where she can surround herself by people of similar values. 
College is nothing like high school. Don’t expect your son to be around the same people as he was in high school.
Student,
Thank you for kind words.   I can only hope there are many more sincere young men like yourself on the row.   I’m guessing you are not in son’s fraternity.  If you were, you would likely know him from my descriptions.  This fall, my son started a prayer group in his fraternity and apparently the meetings are well attended by others members of his fraternity.  He hopes to open up the meetings to other Greeks like yourself in the middle and lower tier fraternities in near future.
God Bless!
USC will be forever viewed as a shallow, brash  party school if the “Row loser culture” of excessive alcohol/drug use and promiscuity continues unabated. Hey, if that is what you want for yourself, relocate to a Skid Row.
What surprises me is that students of substance (as opposed to substance abuse) are not raising their voices to create a more substantial atmosphere at USC. More surprising is the seeming weak will of the administration. Anybody home there?
Sorry for partying
Gabe,
If you are attempting some underhanded slap to Pike it isn’t working.   We have a house.   It’s in the process of getting permits right now and it’s gonna be the sickest house on the row.   Way sicker than TKE or Phi Delt and millions more are being dropped by our alumni than those other two combined.   Will let you come by and collect our empty bottles and pick thru the trash when it’s done.
Um? I don’t think so. Pike is middle tier at best and dropping every day.  truth:
Top Tier:
Sig Chi, Lambda, Phi Psi
Upper Middle:
SAE, TKE, AEPi
the rest don’t matter… that means you
Sounds like hippy dippy talk to me.  Let me tell you something. Keep your voices down and get to work.  Stop whining about our great fraternities and start cutting your hair and taking a bath.  Hell, we drank in my day, but we deserved it.  Most of us had just come back from the war.  Boys like Clark Farland never came back, but you don’t hear me asking for USC to do something about it.  Grow up Gabriel.
Totally agree –couldn’t have said it better. If USC wants to continue to raise its reputation in the U.S. and internationally, it needs to address The Row problem once and for all.
Quite frankly, the locals need to get over it. As a recently graduated student, I can firmly say that our “neighbors” are perhaps USC’s biggest detriment towards attracting the best and the brightest. They snatch up the hundreds of jobs USC offers, but still seem more than happy to rape, rob, mug, and stab students as they see fit. Newsflash: when you play a double standard like that, your opinions count for nothing. USC students owe the community nothing. If anything, the “community” owes USC for not pushing harder to gentrify South Central all the way to the Staples Center. Quit while you guys are ahead.
george,
Not only am I a local and have been living in this area since the age of 10 but I am also a student at USC and i can tell YOU george, that i have witnessed first hand how much MY community and “student life” has changed. Its not about extortion. Oh and also, both my parents have been working for USC for TWENTY YEARS! I think I qualify to be tired of you non-locals! Thank you.
@ Grace,
I’m with George, you people with all your complaints about the row are blood sucking liars.   No families live adjacent to the row except for that stupid building USC built for staff on 30th behind Kappa Sig.  That building was built long after the row was here and any SC staff that live there knew what they were getting into.  All other people in surrounding the row are students.   You live either further north of the row or west of Hoover.   Your problem isn’t Greeks but Hipster GDIs who have taken over that area.   We Greeks have nothing to do with the Hipster GDIs and they are there own problem.  Lastly, stay the “F” out of our trash!
Grace,
Sounds like these guys have proven you a liar.  What is clear to me is that you don’t live near the Row.  Neither the Row nor the Greek system is not your real problem.  You are live in another area likely surrounded by SC students away from the Row.  Shutting the Row down will do nothing for you or your imaginary family.  Try latching on to some other issue to benefit your miserable existence living among the scourge of worthless GDIs.
I’m one of those fraternity men from the golden age of the Row and fraternities at SC.   We drank and made merry often and rarely had any problems with anyone.   The problem with these kids today is no one has instructed them how to drink.  Your mealy mouthed baby-boomer parents have ruined this country and your generation.  We had the wisdom of a lot of Korean War vets and even a few WWII guys on the GI bill who knew how drink.  Often an older Vet would sit the pledges down with bottle of Whiskey or Gin and drink shot for shot until it was gone.   No one threw-up, passed out or needed an ambulance and trip to see a doctor at a local hospital.  You kids should be embarrassed by your lack of skill in drinking.   I think it would be to everyone’s benefit to hold classes or some sort of instruction on proper drinking skills.  If you put the word out to older alumni of my generation, you might get a few willing to help teach classes.
Fight-On!
Much thanks to John ’55 for reminding me of the days of old.  As an engineer, we had a small house behind the main fraternity.  There was no alcohol allowed back then in the fraternity house, but a few of us including Bill Shepard, who made a name for himself with apartments in El Paso, and John Friedlander, who worked for Douglas near El Segundo before his untimely pass, enjoyed a drink or two.  My point is holding your liquor takes work.  Commitment.  I wouldn’t dream of getting taken to the hospital over a sour stomach.  If you threw it up you threw it up and then you started again the next day.  Character would solve 90% of the issues we are seeing now.  Not policy.
To anyone living by the row, the row existed long before other residents. This has been going on for decades. Don’t complain when you move into a collegiate area and tell college kids to quiet it down. 
It sucks that some individuals were responsible for ruining these couple of weeks for the rest of the community but the row will rally back as it always has.
While this is an excellent first step toward balancing school and social, as a Theta Alumnae, I can share that much more needs to happen.   Sadly, reality shows like Jersey Shore have “normalized” outrageous behavior including drug and alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity and a wanton lack of respect for others.  We need the pendulum to swing back a little…. and remind ourselves that fraternity and sororities were not originally organized to be about partying, outlandish behavior and trashing frat houses.  For example, my father, an SAE for 65 years who passed away this year, was the consummate fraternity man–charitable, kind, respectful of women, intelligent, honest, generous and a True Gentleman with a jest for live.   He was truly heart-broken that frats had become places to get high, black out, hook up and be anything but a gentleman and was actually very proud that his grandson, a water polo player at USC, didn’t pledge a fraternity.  That’s really sad to me…
I just want to thank that Theta I met at the 9-0 for the hand experience.  I’ll never forget you!
YOLO
It’s about time you guys! I think that this ban should last forever and move ALL future social events to campus from now on. Students don’t realize (fail to acknowledge) that families still reside near and around the row not just college party animals. The partying and the noise is way out of control and quiet frankly I’ve had enough.  I am more concerned about the respect these kids owe our neighborhood! The only time it’s ever quiet around here is during parent week (i wonder why!) but as soon as the parents take off and leave their credit cards it’s all back to wild partying.   USC, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!! Acknowledge that families still live in this area and that we are owed some respect. we have sacrificed our privacy and our peace as USC continues to build new facilities (and fails to provide more parking), our streets are congested and the noise keeps getting louder (not just at night).  I’d like to see the University remind the students to be humble, respectful and courteous. In addition, I feel that parents should be sent a letter or email and should be aware of what is happening and what their kids are doing. Maybe parents need to have a talk with their kids. if you think parent involvement is too much because “you’re an adult”…. Then act like one!
I understand this is college and it’s your time for sex and drugs but I think it’s now way out of control.
 USC, remember the little people, we’re still here.
Grace,
You’re no little person.  We are all tired of you locals extorting SC whenever you get a chance.
George,
The caterpiller is small before he blooms into the butterfly.  The bumblebee is small before he takes flight into blue sky. The lion cub is small before he lets forth with his mighty roar.  But George you are small for evermore.  Rise up I say! small people — here and wide.  Be heard, agitate, educate, organize!  Oppression seems large in the here and now.  But Obama will provide what we need without a bow.

Mad talented — that’s pretty much the only way to describe Woods.
Formed in 2005 in Brooklyn, N.Y., the alternative folk group, made up of solid writers and artistic masters, quickly gained attention for its uniquely lo-fi yet intricate song structures and pensive lyrics. After adding signature jam sessions during its live shows, the jaw-dropping creativity and musical faculty of Woods became promptly known.
Rainy undertones · Though Woods’ Bend Beyond features sunny, cheerful instrumentals, the album boasts dark lyrics and themes. – | Photo courtesy of Force Field PR
The band has long been recognized for the arching sense of immediacy in its records. Its previous albums had a raw, last-minute sound that made the actual recording seem like an afterthought. But for its latest effort released last Tuesday, Bend Beyond, the band has traded in the garage alt-folk for a masterpiece of high-fidelity studio sounds.
As lead singer Jeremy Earl told Pitchfork, “That was always our style: embrace the spontaneous energy of recording a song the minute after it’s written, do the overdubs really fast, mix while recording. For this album, we decided to re-record stuff more.”
That re-recording is evident in Bend Beyond. Rich sounds are seamlessly layered over each other, with a solid rhythm section filling the background with steady poise. And Earl’s truly flawless falsetto vocals take over every song, making for a musical combination that is incredibly easy to listen to.
The title track has long been a jam staple for Woods’ live shows but is much more concise and edited in recording. It’s one thing to have the skill and capacity to be a jam band (especially a good one), but to abridge your jams into a four-minute pop song is a whole other ability, one Woods also masters.
In the deceivingly simple “Cascade,” the band condenses an epic jam into one minute and 55 seconds, all while packing in a tinge of Eastern melody, a guitar yearning to break into distortion and a bass drum that means business. Woods doesn’t seem to believe in filler, instead approaching the album with a mentality both economical and creatively satisfying.
There’s much 1960s influence on the record as well. The poppy first single, “Cali In a Cup,” presents a textbook definition of sunny music. Earl’s vocals are tuned to perfection here, and the harmonica adds a nostalgic vibe of good memories.
Meanwhile, the airy “Wind Was The Wine” and the mysterious “Size Meets The Sound” possess psychedelic undertones so authentic, they almost seem accidentally inspired — this carries through in regards to Earl’s vocals as well.
Earl is often compared to Neil Young in vocal sound, but that overlooks the whole Grateful Dead vibe of the band. Not only does the band jam as well as the Dead (arguably the pioneers of live jamming), but Earl’s vocals bring to mind Jerry Garcia’s soft serenading.
Even the song structures of the album hark back to Dead days; Garcia and his writing partner, Robert Hunter, were known for their juxtaposition of reflective lyrics with poppy melodies, an aspect that Woods has perfected as its own.
As cheery and sunny as the music might be, Bend Beyond flirts with the lyrical dark side. Songs of emotional doom and gloom are sewn together with upbeat, poppy melodies, making for the perfect mix of enchanting dejection. You might even call Woods the Grateful Dead of the 21st century, a gifted psychedelic/alt-country/jam band that dares to be pigeonholed and masquerades profundity under the guise of pop. Not many bands would be able to pull off such a feat, but Woods does it with ease and style.
Production-wise, the dreamy album is crisp, clear and perfectly arranged. The foot-tapper “Find Them Empty” follows the ethereal, melancholy “Back To Stone.” The impossibly poppy “Cali In A Cup” is followed by “Is It Honest,” a song in which Earl makes cussing sound so beautiful that your conservative grandma would be singing along to it.
Moulding inspiration into authenticity, Woods has managed to capture time-honored sounds that garner acclaim while still feeling fresh. The album is a beautiful trip down a memory lane that has yet to exist, and these lush, aural groves are the kind of Woods that you’ll love to get lost in.

Fashion Greek, a customized clothing and official licensed product vendor, opened to the public on Thursday, Sept. 13 with a highly publicized kickoff event that included free dinner, raffle prizes and swag bags filled with t-shirts and mugs. Located across from the West 27th Place Apartments, the shop is a first for the brand, hopefully setting a standard for many more to follow.
Tee time · Fashion Greek promises to elevate the shopping experience near USC’s campus with broad appeal and an eye for customer service. – Yasmin Yeganeh | Daily Trojan
“It was a really nice event,” said Fredel Romano, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I was impressed with their wide selection of clothing options to print on, and I’ll definitely be back.”
Seeking to “rep a higher standard,” Steven Hoel, Mark Yeung, Lauren Turk and the rest of the Fashion Greek team provide high-end, accessible and customizable clothing. The brand’s free-standing location, in a clean yet cool industrial space just one street above the Row, presents plenty of creative possibilities available to the customer.
Hoel’s brainchild, Fashion Greek was a concept without a market; for twenty years, he envisioned a space in which a customers could walk into a store, view the full assortment of clothing alongside a digital catalogue and make their selection. Customers would then wait in an uber-chic lounge while their product was made in-store.
The ultimate manifestation of Hoel’s vision, Fashion Greek, is a quaint, trendy shop with a sleek, modern interior of brick walls, glossed floors and a sandblasted ceiling — a far cry from a space that had previously been utilized as a boxing gym. Drawing inspiration from Urban Outfitters, Hoel says the versatile interior was designed to be flexible, with plenty of racks and drawers that can be adjusted and moved around to accommodate customers.
The clothing, too, is versatile. Besides basic digital printing, Fashion Greek also offers rhinestone application and a diverse selection of hand-stitched Greek letters — their store specialty. The store also features a posh food lounge featuring a community board, free Wi-Fi, kosher sandwiches from nearby Fashion Bistro and other high-quality snacks. Customers can nosh in the lounge while their apparel is being customized.
“We want the store to serve as a hangout zone and [a] respite for students,” Yeung said.
As for choosing USC as the location for Fashion Greek’s first store, Hoel explains that he initially targeted the top-revenue generating schools in California. After discovering that the rent near USC was reasonable (compared to the exorbitant rent prices near UCLA, for example) he settled on the Trojans and Figueroa Corridor.
Proximity to The Row and Greek life are bonus factors, although Yeung insists that those who are not a part of the Greek system should not be deterred.
“Greek is in our name, but we’re open to anyone who wants to make [custom] orders,” he said.
In the coming months, Fashion Greek will strive to become even more actively involved in the USC community, bringing in more clothes in cardinal and gold and sponsoring the Philanthropy Cup. The Cup will award $1,000 each to the philanthropy of the fraternity and sorority that spends the most money at Fashion Greek this year.
“We truly hope to ingrain ourselves in the community, not only through our merchandise but through our charity outreach as well,” Yeung said. “We want to be accessible to every student.”
MacDaddy would be proud.

When my father was born in 1941 Oklahoma, African-Americans could not share water fountains or school pencils with Caucasians, let alone date them.
My, how times have changed.
Though it comes with its own set of problems, interracial dating has become less of a dangerous endeavor and more of — dare I say it? — a normal thing.
As an African-American graduate of a private high school, I have always been around more Caucasians than African-Americans, and my romantic counterparts have reflected that.
Others have had the opposite experience. A white junior majoring in engineering thinks that she is mostly into Asians at USC because she “came from a particularly white, tiny private school.”
“We literally only had two Asians in our entire grade. and they were girls,” she said.
I have never had a problem with dating mostly white guys, and with the exception of a couple of jokes, my parents don’t really care either.
This is certainly a reflection of our modern age. And though some parents might be like my own — wary of welcoming an in-law of another race  — society in the United States fervently frowns upon a parent who refuses to allow their child to cross racial boundaries.
In the case of a junior public relations major with an attraction to blond-haired, blue-eyed cuties, her Indian family is “rather sad, especially if [she doesn’t] have an Indian wedding.”
As of right now, the student’s parents are fine with her decision to date solely white men. She’s not sure, however, how they will take it if and when she seriously settles down with someone of another race.
Some students certainly do meet their future spouses in college, but in this day and age, most don’t get married until age 26 or after. Because of the fact that college is often seen as a time of experimentation and fun, parents of children who tend to date outside their race probably don’t think that it’ll amount to anything.
In reality, though, the kind of people you date in college have a strong significance. As USC Professor of anthropology Erin Moore said, “Dating is that baby step leading to figuring out who you want to marry.”
And though many parents can bite their tongue when their child brings home a boyfriend or girlfriend of a different racial background, the idea of their grandchildren sharing cultural values with those of another race can be disheartening.
“What I’ve noticed is that you don’t really understand your own feelings about things until you are raising your own children,” Moore said. “You think about ‘how am I going to celebrate the holidays?’ Things that are innate in you become issues in a marriage.”
Most college students aren’t looking for partners to settle down with for the rest of their lives. But in a quest for a semi-serious romantic counterpart, you might find that you don’t consciously choose a mate based on their color. It just so happens that your eyes go all Jessica Rabbit for a particular race.
When asked if she was attracted to Mexicans because of the taboo nature of crossing racial lines, a white senior said, “No, I’m just attracted to their tall, dark and naturally handsome good looks.”
And as one white junior puts it, “I’ve learned a lot of Spanish through some of my guys, tried new foods. I think because I am white and do not really like American culture, this part makes it easy for me.”
With students becoming more comfortable with dating outside of their race, an increase in mixed-race populations is inevitable. According to The New York Times, the 2010 U.S. Government Census showed a 134 percent increase in people who identify as multiracial since 2000.
These people will date those of all colors, and in the future, the face of our families will reflect the diversity that our country aims to protect. In a few years, there will be no such as 100 percent black or 100 percent Latino, and this conversation will be nonexistent.
So while bringing home your black boyfriend might not go over as terribly — or hilariously — as on Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, your parents and grandparents might still feel a tinge of disappointment that their grandchildren will not have the same upbringing that you or they had.
But as the years go by, society will change and people will simply adapt — as they always have.
 
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in critical studies. Her column “Lovegame” runs Thursdays.
Yep.
And being a racial “victim” all your life,
fitting into stereotypical behaviors,
& hating + envying others,
will ENSLAVE you forever.
Mixing, listening, including everyone…
Why exclude others ?
But, to be fair, consider what your grandkids could look like…

Before The Devil Wears Prada or Ugly Betty, there was Diana Vreeland: the woman who “created the fashion editor.” She was the Anna Wintour of our grandparents’ generation, taking the helm at Vogue in 1963 after a 25-year tenure at the fashion magazine Harper’s Bazaar.
The biographical documentary Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel aims to paint a portrait of the fashion icon using film clips, magazine pages and recordings from personal interviews. The first film by Lisa Immordino Vreeland, the wife of Diana Vreeland’s grandson, The Eye Has to Travel is nothing if not a sentimental look back at fashion’s glory days: the Belle Époque, the Roaring ’20s and the youth revolt of the 1960s. The viewer is taken on a chronological journey through Vreeland’s lifetime, illustrated by her beautiful, cutting-edge magazine covers and editorial spreads. Watching the film is almost like opening an archive of yesterday’s styles, flipping from page to page, intermittently being swallowed up in a fantasy of feathers, furs and pearls.
For the fashion-obsessed, some of the footage is a dream come true, like being taken inside private fittings with Coco Chanel. Scanning the trajectory of dresses, jewelry and swimwear trends, The Eye Has to Travel boasts a thrilling ride full of fancy. The film depicts the lightheartedness of the industry while recognizing its greater significance.
But the film might fall flat for those less invested in the historic world of fashion, as its purely sequential arrangement fails to give the story dimension.
If today’s editor in chief of Vogue, Anna Wintour, came across as an ice queen in the 2009 Sundance documentary The September Issue (a film to which comparisons are bound to be made) Vreeland shines with a theatrical voice and an electric personality, bringing life to the screen just like she did to magazine pages years before.
But, as in many fashion documentaries, the eccentric quotes make the movie. Vreeland famously announced “The bikini is the biggest thing since the atom bomb” at the time of its creation in 1946 — reflecting the idea the clothing has its own way of conveying that cultural and political climate of its time. And despite her lack of an education, Vreeland had a sincere way of reflecting fashion’s changing styles in her work.
The film highlights some of the most significant turning points in women’s history, following not only the clothing but also the diverse array of women who wore it. A feminist thinker, Vreeland asks the question: “Are women different than they ever were?”
The art of getting dressed and keeping a home might seem frivolous in her early Harper’s Bazaar column titled “Why don’t you …,” but Vreeland, who paved the way for many women in subsequent years, asks the viewer to question the innate power women have to contribute to society.
Both Vreeland and the documentary challenge the audience to look at the form of the ever-evolving woman. It is a film about progress, and it depicts this theme in a way that is vibrant and theatrical, feeling more like a thriller than a textbook.
The film’s strong suit lies in its candid interviews with industry icons, including designers Oscar de la Renta and Diane von Furstenberg. Each segment is cut brilliantly to reflect the persona of the interviewees. Such legends add a modern presence to a documentary that would otherwise be fully composed of vintage footage.
In addition, there are the requisite quips from former assistants and photographers, some of whom refer to her as “threatening” or “difficult.” As the original fashion visionary and purveyor of good taste, Vreeland did have the capacity to make outlandish requests of her staff. The Eye Has to Travel touches on that reputation, but in general paints a glowing picture of the editor as “the empress of fashion.”
Vreeland’s legacy lives on in the form of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, where she spent her final years expanding the museum’s historical fashion exhibits and introducing what is still one of fashion’s most celebrated nights: the annual Costume Institute Gala.
Fitting, considering the Costume Institute continues to push boundaries and provoke conversation among the fashion and art crowds around the world.

Body Language has been unfairly crowned by the press as the next big thing in electronic music.
The group earned rave reviews for its early tour stops and tracks. It has featured in movies such as Black Swan, and stars such as Toro y Moi have produced the group’s music.
Musical meltdown · Despite the group’s intentions to strive for R&B-focused sounds, Body Language’s Grammar misses the mark. – | Photo courtesy of Jonathan Hokklo
 
The group has been remixed by Matt & Kim, drummed for Matthew Dear and written tracks for Passion Pit. The group certainly doesn’t lack for indie cred, although that seems to be the only thing they have in spades. Body Language’s sound, on both its second EP and first album (confusingly, both named Social Studies) as well as its new EP Grammar, seems torn between paths, confused about where to go and what it’s trying to do.
Before this release, Body Language talked about ditching the disco that made it a darling of the press to go for an R&B-focused sound. But the group must have postponed this move, because Grammar is more of a continuation of its previous sound than any sort of change. It’s the same kind of mindless fun, but this time around it feels more mindless than fun.
The EP does not start out on the best foot.  “The First” is filled with soaring harmonies and synths hissing in the background. A woodblock beat, one of the only analog instruments in the mix, disappears after the first chorus, and hearing the same thing looped over and over doesn’t match standard ideas of groundbreaking disco and the song.
“Lose My Head” sounds like somebody trying very hard to make a mindless dance track. The song’s clearly focused on a dance groove with a chorus, but offers nothing else — including proper lyrics or verses. That’s not to say it’s bad; in fact, it’s probably the highlight of the EP. The beat goes on and on while the title is half-sung, half-shrieked over the hypnotizing synth stylings. Unlike the music of other disco artists, including Matthew Dear, there isn’t much below the surface. There’s one verse, one chorus and it’s repeated ad nauseum. Body Language was probably not going for something with depth, and it’s still a funky dance song that’s sure to pack the floors, but the track disappoints if you go in expecting anything more.
The final track takes Body Language to the R&B sound they talked up before the release. “I’m a Mess” is probably more self-descriptive than the band meant it to be. It features the singer settling into a groove while assuring the listener “You don’t need to worry / Without you I’m a mess.” The slow jam certainly sets a loving mood, and features more emotion in those two lines than the rest of the EP, but it feels like too little, too late. It’s a mediocre foray into the R&B world to cap off an EP that promised much more.
The EP puts Body Language in a category of underachievers in the indie world: a group unable to live up to its own hype. Instead of seeing an artist evolve as it’s claiming to, Body Language puts out two more similar tracks and another that feels like a half-effort. Grammar feels like steps backward for the group, and if it does go through their genre switch as planned, it’s going to have to rebuild the praise it received for its disco tunes. The future might still be bright for Body Language, but a bit harder.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s campaign has been littered with its fair share of political blunders. This week, those blunders reached a peak with a video posted on the website of the magazine Mother Jones. The video captured Romney describing the 47 percent of American citizens who receive aid from the government as “victims” who are “dependent upon the government.”
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
First, let’s admit the obvious. Romney made a mistake. No presidential candidate should have to insert his foot in his mouth this frequently, and declaring that a whopping 47 percent of the U.S. population is dependent on government aid fails to recognize retirees with pensions, veterans, students and other demographics who have perfectly acceptable claims to federal aid.
But the video itself, while certainly significant, is nowhere near as disturbing as the context surrounding its publication. Starting with an obscure clip posted to YouTube on May 31, the video was found by a freelance writer, who sent the clip to the Washington bureau chief of Mother Jones, David Corn. Corn then spent the next several weeks convincing the owner of the video to send him the uncut version. The magazine released the first part of the video Monday and is waiting to release part two at some point in the next couple of weeks.
The situation calls attention to some of the major problems with the media in this year’s presidential election. Why did Corn spend so much time pursuing one defamatory video? And why is the magazine waiting to release the video in two parts?
This epitomizes sensationalist journalism, plain and simple. The focus of an election should be on candidates’ genuine policies, plans and decisions, not on a few poorly chosen words. The amount of coverage given to this story is disproportionate to its actual significance in the election.
And though Mother Jones claims that it is releasing the video in two parts so it can give the story adequate coverage, the publication might have an alterior motive. After publishing the first part of the video, Mother Jones received almost 2 million page views in a span of 24 hours — a number twice the previous record. By breaking the video into two parts, they increase their hype and keep people returning to the website at the viewers’ expense.
This election has already become a very negative one in terms of media coverage that has focused more on candidates’ gaffes and flaws than their actual platforms. The candidates themselves are no better — there have been some low blows this year as far as campaign advertisements go. The overwhelming exposure of the Mother Jones video only adds to this mood.
While Romney’s insensitive words are certainly worth noting, that’s as far as our attention to the incident should go. He made a mistake, and will face repercussions for it — this does not mean, however, that it should be one of the most talked-about events of the election. Rather than focusing on insignificant, “controversial” events and blowing them out of proportion, the media should be paying attention to the candidates’ policies, decisions and staff. News outlets should also provide prompt and complete coverage, rather than releasing news strategically to increase a viewer count. And we, as consumers of media, must consider the relevancy and quality of the information we receive.

Our allies and challengers will be listening carefully to our president. Every word a candidate speaks provides, sharpens and confirms our impressions of the candidate. The same is true of the candidates actions. Forcibly cutting the hair of a gay student in prep school? Really, Mr.Romney!
You are correct that the media does take many, many stories and blows them out of proportion (whether its political or otherwise). What I do think is critical here tho is that while many have labeled Romney as the “rich”, pro-high wealth candidate, these sorts of comments are much more than a mistake. They indicate who he really is, and that is very newsworthy. Also, since it is a verbatim audio tape, it is hardly “defamatory”. It is his own words.
“Media must stop focusing on gaffes”
That might be a lot easier if the Governor would quit ‘stepping in it’ near daily.

The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy group dedicated to promoting First Amendment rights at institutions of higher learning, recently rated USC as a “red light university.” In order to be rated as a red light university, a school must have “at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.”
For a university so dedicated to intellectual inquiry and discovery, USC is apparently not too free-speech friendly.
FIRE’s annual report, released this month, listed the top colleges and universities for free speech. They compiled this list after looking at whether or not an institution’s policies restrict free speech and whether the school had recently censored student speech. The top seven schools chosen received a “green light” rating (meaning no university policies seriously impede free speech).
Not one school in California made the top seven cut. In fact, USC is rated as one of the most restrictive universities in an already restrictive state.
If USC is to be an institution that is truly dedicated to intellectual exploration and the betterment of society, the administration must revise its speech-related policies to allow for true on-campus freedom of speech.
Though many of USC’s policies received less than favorable ratings from FIRE, one clause from this year’s SCampus, the university’s student guidebook that provides information on everything from campus safety to plagiarism, is particularly disconcerting. A section called “University Policy on Free Expression and Dissent” offers a definition for “fighting words,” or speech that is “abusive and insulting rather than a communication of ideas” that is used in an abusive manner. USC prohibits “fighting words” in all on-campus activity. According to another SCampus policy, no literature posted or distributed on campus may contain “fighting words.”
These policies broad implications for free speech on campus and have the capacity to effectively stifle any expression that may be considered offensive or not politically correct.
It is nearly impossible to exercise free speech without offending people. The reason why the Founding Fathers thought it so important to protect individuals’ rights to free expression was because they knew that there would always be people who try to restrict speech that they disagree with. As a democracy committed to individual liberties, the Founding Fathers knew that all citizens must be protected from censorship and be allowed to speak their minds.
The case should not be any different at USC nor any other college campus. As academic microcosms representing the best and brightest of America, universities must adhere to the constitutional right to unfettered free speech as fervently as — if not more than — the country as a whole.
This is especially true now.
With the presidential election coming in November, the unrest in the Middle East and the many other controversial issues currently at play in the United States, there will be no shortage of issues for students to get fired up about. The obscurity of the “fighting words” clause could make it against university policy for a Republican to criticize President Barack Obama or a Democrat to vilify Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney if someone were to deem the criticism offensive. Since much of politics can quickly become offensive, or at least controversial, the university’s definition of fighting words does not leave too much room for free expression and debate over the hot-button issues.
Of course, USC doesn’t need to be like Berkeley during the Free Speech Movement era in order to exemplify free speech on college campuses. (Today, FIRE deems Berkeley a “yellow light” institution, meaning it has at least one ambiguous policy that can encourage “administrative abuse and arbitrary application.”) And it is not to say FIRE’s rating indicates administrative intolerance of controversial beliefs or speech at USC. But it would be a major step forward for liberty on campus if the administration were to change such potentially stifling provisions as the “fighting words” clause.
Until then, though, let’s just hope that the administration won’t get in the way of student debate and discussion. College is the time for young people to speak their minds, and we shouldn’t have to worry that expressing our beliefs might break with university policy. Policy should uphold the message that USC itself sends to its students — to be outspoken, ambitious, respectful individuals.
 
Sarah Cueva is a junior majoring in political science and Middle East studies.
The Fighting Words restriction on free speech has been established by the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  The language you report from SCampus is no different than what the Court has said an acceptable limitation.
SomeTHING or someBODY has moved the Daily Trojan (this newspaper) to deny paid advertising space to Bradley Smith, a historical revisionist who wishes to invite open debate of history as it regards the Holocaust of Europe from 1933 to 1945.
Whether you think Smith sincere or a wolf in sheep’s clothing, this practice (presumably a response to pressure exerted through the Hillel Foundation or the Anti-Defamation League) certainly does not comport with the principle of free speech (on the part of advertisers in this case).
So, we (I work with Smith – click my name to visit his site) are relegated to making Comments like this.

Los Angeles is certainly a haven for foodies: Copious restaurants with every kind of taste and style are spread across our grand city. Sure it can get a bit expensive, but if you’re ever down to step away from campus and experience delicious food with your friends or family, then you’ll have no problem finding a place.
But when you’re gluten free, dining out becomes more of a liability than a fun experience. Yes, there are plenty of healthy hipster cafeteria-like places such as M Café, but the idea of sitting down for a gluten-free meal is almost unheard of.
Not so in the indie wonderlands of Seattle and Portland. A quick vacation there this past summer exposed me to the wonders of gluten-free pizza made in a delicious pizzeria, massive gluten-free sections and made-to-order food in supermarkets, as well as gluten-free bread at Subway. Subway.
You would think that L.A. would be at the forefront of crazy dietary fads. If there’s a place that can sell vegan ice cream, there should be more than one gluten-free bakery around.
One should never have to say the words “Seattle and Portland has better food for me,” but unfortunately in this case, they win. L.A. certainly needs to step it up.

Hundreds of protestors converged on the New York Stock Exchange Monday to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the Occupy movement. For many present, the celebration reawakened an energy they had not felt since the protest was officially evicted from New York’s Zuccotti Park last November.
For those of us far from The Big Apple, the anniversary also offers a chance to reevaluate the movement’s success. While Occupy Wall Street may not have produced any direct effect on economic policy, it has contributed to a resurgence in activism which youth should not hesitate to take advantage of.
At the height of its publicity last fall, Occupy was a household name. It spread rapidly from a relatively small contingent of New Yorkers camped out on Wall Street to tens of thousands of demonstrators nationwide, staging actions everywhere from the steps of city halls to college campuses. It was the largest contiguous, long-standing protest this country has seen since the Vietnam War and it motivated many individuals previously unengaged with socioeconomic justice to reconsider our nation’s distribution of wealth.
Occupy has been criticized for never effecting a policy change; however such criticism misses the point. Occupy Wall Street was always intended as a popular awareness movement. It never presented a formal list of demands because it intentionally avoided the hierarchy necessary to generate and deliver those demands.
Regardless, the grievance of Occupy protestors was clear and their message, delivered. Ninety-nine percent is no longer an arbitrary figure; it is an ideology. Meanwhile, those who participated in Occupy gained a fervor that translated into demonstrations for more specific causes. It is no coincidence that Los Angeles, for example, has had a particularly fruitful year for protests—from the largest anti-Walmart demonstration since the store’s opening to the labor rights actions that have taken place on our own campus.
College students have traditionally been the driving force behind activism in the United States, and with the advent of the Occupy Movement, we have the tools to continue in this tradition. Occupy Wall Street prepared America; if we have something to say, more people than ever will perhaps be listening.
