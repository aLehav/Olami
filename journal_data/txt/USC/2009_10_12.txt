Fifteen years ago, Chris Rock got the idea to create a documentary depicting the struggles various hair types pose, and the ramifications of “fashionable” hair styles within the black community. When his daughter asked him, “Daddy, how come I don’t have good hair?” Rock jumped into action to solve the issue for her, but also to initiate a dialogue within society at large.
Rock’s Good Hair shines a light on the absurdity of black hair care through a series of events that reach a climax at the Bronner Bros. International Hair and Beauty Show — the largest convention and competition of black hair products and styling in the world. This show is so ridiculous it cannot be adequately described in words, and is completely worthy of its own documentary. It is the only show of its kind, a place where competing stylists are considered trite if they cut their models’ hair while hanging upside-down.
Air dry · Chris Rock executive produced and co-wrote Good Hair, a new documentary that examines the reasoning behind hair trends in the black community, particularly among women. The documentary features interviews with Maya Angelou, Rev. Al Sharpton and Nia Long, among others. - Photo courtesy of Roadside Attractions
Rock’s documentary intercuts the build up to the Bronner Bros. fiasco with interviews from stylists, product gurus, black celebrities, barber shop patrons and employees. Even Maya Angelou and Rev. Al Sharpton offer their perspectives on the use of relaxers, wigs and weaves. Rock takes us through unexpected territories, including corner store weave shops, Indian Temples and black market merchants.  With comedic expertise, he demonstrates the enormous spectacle black hair styles have become, but, in doing so, also washes over the heart of the issue.
Rock’s comedic approach makes the topic light enough for people of all demographics to watch and enjoy, but the documentary suffers from its reluctancy to approach any sincere depths. In nearly all the moments where the film takes the audience to a point of controversy or poignancy, it backs away. In fact, Rock himself seems to be biting his tongue when discussions of the subject begin to reach touchy levels.
For example, Rock interviews Sharpton, who says he’s been straightening his hair since James Brown got him into it during the Reagan administration (sounds like a hoot already, doesn’t it?). As a black social leader, Sharpton sees no harm in habitually rejecting the natural curl of his hair, but does take issue with the fact that most black hair care establishments are owned by white companies. The problem for Sharpton, then, is not that black people across the country are subjected to the grueling, tedious and painful treatment processes of falsifying their hair for ambiguous motives, but, rather, where the money goes. The reaction shots of Rock in this discussion all show him looking a bit confused, or maybe even mildly startled, yet he never questions Sharpton on this discrepancy.
But there are a few moments where the subtlety of the statements really pays off. Near the end of the film, actress Nia Long tells Rock, “It’s all about working with what you’ve got.”
Rock replies, facetiously, “Or weave in what you don’t.” With complete sincerity, Long agrees, prompting the audience to think critically about the nature of the statement. What message is she sending to all the little black girls across the country? The answer is the same message girls of all races receive everyday through popular media and social networks: It is their duty as females to succumb to social pressures in order to boost their physical appearance.
The overall message of the film was very confusing, and, therefore, ultimately complacent and intellectually frugal. It seemed like Rock had one idea of where he wanted to take his film, and nearly all of his interviewees had another. In short, it seemed like an awfully long journey for such a cookie-cutter answer. True, the subject is enormously complex, combining gender, race and self-esteem issues, but with the quick pace of the film combined with a runtime of only 95 minutes, Good Hair could have easily absorbed another few minutes here and there to add much needed richness to the discussion.
Good Hair is incredibly funny and certainly worth seeing. It does prompt viewers to think, even if just for a moment, about the lengths to which people are willing to go for their appearance.

Fellow students, you can relax. You are no longer responsible for the all-nighters you pulled during midterms. The blame for your procrastination can finally be placed on a greater force than yourself, when you are diagnosed with the hot new disorder you’re guaranteed to have: Internet Addiction Disorder, also known as IAD.
Apparently, IAD is real. Most commonly, the disorder is associated with live gaming, but symptoms include the inability to stop browsing and irritability when you cannot get to a computer — feelings most college students have likely experienced. Internet addiction is linked with ADD, which is understandable because of the web’s fast-paced nature and the plethora of — ooh look, Google changed its logo!
As I was saying, because the Internet offers so much information in such an accessible way, it is a monster that draws out the ADD in all of us. We are then faced with a classic case of the chicken and the egg — is our inability to focus because we are addicted to the Internet, or are we addicted to the Internet because we cannot focus?
Perhaps our attention spans have been shortened by the pure laziness we’ve developed. We’ve let the Internet substitute quick, easy solutions for inconveniences we didn’t know we had. Today, we watch our favorite shows on Hulu and manage our bank accounts without actually stepping foot into a bank.
It seems like only yesterday the Internet was more of a hassle than it was handy, taking forever to load ugly interfaces and useless pages that would have paled in comparison to today’s Wikipedia. Now, the Internet offers us a blissful shopping experience in our underwear, and as soon as we click “Place Order,” we can return to Facebook stalking.
As Rainn Wilson sarcastically tweeted this weekend, “This Internet thing is really catching on.” The Internet has made its mark on almost every industry and individual. In turn, the industries and individuals have made their marks on the Internet, offering their goods and services in online form. As the Internet fills the role of the original mediums it was intended to supplement, it becomes integrated with society, an almost mandatory part of our day-to-day existence.
This is precisely what makes being addicted to the Internet just that much harder — you can’t stop using the Internet just like an alcoholic can’t stop drinking. You would be doing yourself more harm than good, especially if you were enrolled in school.
The nation’s first IAD rehab center, reSTART, tries to help those committed rediscover a balance between the dot-coms and their “real” lives. It seems this balance, however, is already skewed. A New York Times article said we spend 8.5 hours a day looking at screens of some sort, and, with respect to college students, that sounds like an understatement. The question then becomes what is socially mandated digital interaction and what is simply fluff.
Because of the Internet’s inevitable prevalence in our “real” lives, treating IAD as a disease just seems excessive. The Internet is becoming such a dominant way of life that it’s as if we are diagnosing people with a breathing problem. It would probably be more beneficial to simply focus on regulating content, as it is the sites with seemingly no merit that manage to suck the most of my productivity away.
Regulating content could also lessen our desire for instant gratification by helping to put industries back where they belong. The television industry would appreciate being watched as intended — on a television — and the music industry would like it if people stopped stealing its product.
At the end of the day, it’s just an intangible web of zeroes and ones hiding behind a screen. But we become enthralled with that screen, interacting with the binary numbers and viewing their translations as meaningful. We allow these simulated experiences to replace real ones, and suddenly e-zines are replacing magazines, poking on Facebook replaces poking in real life (OK, maybe that is for the better).
Whether or not we are addicted to our screens and what’s behind them is debatable. What is not is the fact that a whole lot of us waste an immeasurable amount of time surfing the net. While this can be justified by pointing fingers at society’s laziness and the crazy social obligations of the new millennium, we’ve got to remember that we shaped this reality and did this to ourselves.
Of course, if fighting the desire to go online for anything and everything someday seems like too much, you can always check yourself into reSTART.
Jen Winston is a junior majoring in communication. Her column, “The Memeing of Life,” runs Tuesdays.
Hey, thanks for writing such an informative article. I was practically unaware of the fact that there is a disease like IAD and a rehab center for it as well. Do agree with you to the fact that internet has grown tremendously in terms of usage and facilities as compared to earlier times, but now we can find anything in the universe on the Internet. But certainly there has to be a limit of using it, and not get addicted to it.

At its first tournament of the preseason, the USC men’s tennis team had an impressive showing at the D’Novo/ITA All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla., with two players reaching the semifinal round in singles competition.
“It was great,” coach Peter Smith said. “We had four people in the main draw, which was the most of any school, and we had two semifinalists — no one was even close to that.”

The Trojans entered the tournament with No. 3 senior Robert Farah, No. 18 sophomore Steve Johnson, No. 49 junior Jaak Poldma and No. 99 sophomore Matt Kecki in the singles draw. Farah and Johnson teamed up in the doubles draw as the No. 3 seed and No. 35 Poldma and Kecki took the courts for doubles as well.
Singles play opened up on Thursday with Farah defeating Alex Stamchev of Auburn 6-2, 6-7, 6-1 and Johnson eliminating No. 8 Jean-Yves Aubone of Florida State with a smooth 6-4, 6-1 victory. Kecki and Poldma were eliminated in the first round by their respective opponents.
In the second round of play, Farah captured another three-set victory over Marek Michalicka of Wisconsin. Johnson matched up with Wisconsin’s Mortiz Baumann, handing him a 7-6 (2), 6-3 decision.
In the round of 16, Farah defeated Oklahoma’s Ionut Beleleu 7-6 (3), 6-4 to push him into the quarterfinal round. Johnson faced off with No. 14 Bradley Klahn of Stanford, who defeated him last spring to capture the Pac-10 singles title. This time around, Johnson walked away with the victory 6-4, 5-7, 7-5.
In the quarterfinals, Farah defeated Michigan’s Jason Jung in straight sets 7-5, 6-3, while Johnson took down Florida’s Alex Lacroix 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
In the semifinal round, Farah took the first set from No. 2 John-Patrick Smith of Tennessee 6-3, but Smith, the eventual tournament winner, rallied back to take the next two sets 6-2, 6-2 and end Farah’s run. Johnson’s run also ended in the semifinal round to Oklahoma’s Andrei Dauescu in a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (0) decision.
Coach Smith was pleased with Farah and Johnson’s performances this weekend.
“I think it shows that Steve and Robert are in really good form,” coach Smith said.
In doubles action, the Trojans did not see the same success; both Trojan pairs were eliminated in the first round. John-Patrick Smith and Boris Conkic of Tennessee, who eliminated Farah and Johnson, won the doubles crown.
“I know we had the potential to win the tournament, and I’m sad it had to end that way,” Farah said.
Overall, however, the senior was happy with his performance this weekend.
“I felt like I did well in singles, and the way I approached competition was good,” Farah said.
In all, the Trojans were satisfied considering it was their first tournament since winning the national championship.
“Let’s face it, the standards for this team are a little higher than for most teams, so doing better than everyone is great, but we have to do as well as we can,” coach Smith said.

Completing one of the most hectic weekends in team history, the USC men’s water polo team captured its seventh-straight SoCal Tournament title with a 7-6 victory over No. 4 California Sunday night to finish a stretch of six games in three days on a high note.
The Trojans (16-1, 3-0), had defeated the Golden Bears in their two previous meetings this season — both by scores of 8-6 — and looked ready to take it to California (11-4) as soon as the two teams got into the pool.
Fast start · Senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz got USC on the board early in the Trojans’ 7-6 victory against Cal in the SoCal Tournament final. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz scored just 27 seconds into the first quarter to put USC up an early goal. The senior’s second goal of the tournament invigorated the Trojan-friendly crowd at UC Irvine’s Anteater Pool, but was quickly equalized 41 seconds later by the strong Bear attack.
Senior drivers Justin Rappel and Matt Sagehorn each added goals for the Trojans before the Bears could score again, which came when Cal sophomore Ivan Rackov converted on a 6-5 advantage with less than three minutes left in the half.
Throughout the first half, the Trojans had multiple scoring opportunities, but stellar defensive plays from Cal’s goalie, sophomore Wil Topen, held the Trojan offense in check.
“For them it was all about taking our two-meter men away from us,” Rappel said.
But the team’s familiarity with the Bears helped them plan for Cal’s strategy.
“Just like us, they have a plan that they use against us, a lot of it is anticipating what they are going to do and plan for that,” Rappel said. “There are definitely tendencies that we can see with them.”
Topen was finally broken again when redshirt junior driver Kyle Sterling netted a shot with 1:19 left in the half to put the Trojans up 4-2.
Coming back from the break, both teams stepped up their defense, holding the quarter scoreless until a second goal from Sterling opened a floodgate.
From the time Sterling scored, with 5:03 remaining in the third quarter, the teams exchanged goals on four consecutive possessions, including senior two-meter Jordan Thompson’s third goal of the tournament, and left the score at 6-4 heading into the final frame.
Sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka’s goal, which proved to be the game-winner, punctuated an otherwise defensive-dominated quarter, as the Trojans were able to hold on for a 7-6 victory.
To get a chance at the Bears on Sunday night, the Trojans had to avenge their only loss of the season in the SoCal tourney’s semifinal against No. 2 UCLA.
The Bruins (12-4), who had beaten the Trojans by one goal three weeks ago, had the favor returned to them in Irvine by the Trojans. Senior two-meter Shea Buckner’s goal with 1:49 left on the clock gave the Trojans a 9-8 victory.
“This time around we just stuck to our game plan more,” Rappel said.
On Saturday, the Trojans breezed through the early portions of the SoCal event, dominating No. 17 Bucknell and No. 6 UC Santa Barbara by a combined score of 38-7. Buckner was the star of the early games, netting six goals in the two victories.
Friday held an unusual event for the Trojans — a home game — and they took full advantage, beating No. 15 Princeton 14-3 for the team’s 35th straight home victory. Krumpholz, last year’s Peter J. Cutino Award winner, shone brightly in McDonald’s Swim Stadium, scoring five of the Trojans’ goals, including four of the Trojans’ seven goals in the second quarter.
The Trojans finished up their daylong home stand with a 9-6 exhibition victory over Golden West College, which is widely considered among the best community college water polo teams in the nation.
Six games in three days is not an easy task, and was a new experience for most of the Trojans, but the exhaustion was worth the trouble.
“It’s always hard to play that many games, but winning helps,” Rappel said.

Following last week’s bye, the No. 6 USC Trojans are on pace to get back two familiar faces on both sides of the ball this week as the team prepares for another tough road game in South Bend, Ind., against No. 25 Notre Dame.
Junior receiver Ronald Johnson and sophomore defensive end Armond Armstead made considerable strides in practice Monday that led coach Pete Carroll to believe both will be available come Saturday’s contest.
Ready to roll · Junior receiver Ronald Johnson hopes get back on the field Saturday after suffering a broken collarbone before the season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Both players suffered injuries in late August and were sidelined for roughly six weeks. Armstead returned to practice last week after breaking his left foot Aug. 20 during a morning practice, and Johnson ­— who first began practicing last Tuesday and participated in the Trojans’ weekend scrimmage — is getting more reps every day as he continues to recover from a broken collarbone he suffered during an Aug. 29 preseason scrimmage.
“It was great that they practiced,” Carroll said. “Armond got a lot of work [Monday]. I put him in a couple spots, and he made it through feeling good, so that’s terrific. Ronald’s back in there. He’s ready to play.”
Carroll said barring an unexpected setback later this week, both players should see be able to jump back on the field in South Bend. However, he wouldn’t comment on how much playing time either player would receive.
While it’s possible Armstead could fill a number of spots on a suddenly injury-ridden USC defensive line, Johnson’s role may not be as large as it was before his injury.
“Right now I’d be thrilled if he plays a lot,” Carroll said. “That’d be great. I don’t care about starting. That’s not a concern at all. It’s just if we can get him in the game plan, and he can contribute and get him playing football again.”
Armstead and Johnson said they’re both ready to get back on the field and help out any way they can for the Trojans.
“Whatever the coaches want me to do, I’m comfortable playing [any position],” Armstead said. “I feel like they’ll get me ready by game time.”
Johnson admitted the coaches would probably take a “conservative” approach with him this weekend, but it all depends on how he practices the rest of the week. He said he is looking forward to being back on the field again, even if his playing time is limited.
“I’m just happy I’m out here,” he said. “I’m just excited to be out here, back again and ready to work hard.”
Johnson’s speed also provides freshman quarterback Matt Barkley with a deep-option receiver other than redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams. Johnson was the Trojans’ third-leading receiver last season with 33 catches for 570 yards and eight touchdowns.
“I just think I will scare the defense a little bit more,” he said. “They have to play honest as far as the run and the pass. So I feel I bring the deep threat.”
Although Johnson will get some time as receiver Saturday, Carroll said the junior will not return kickoffs, as Johnson had done during the past two seasons for USC.
“I think we’ll just wait on that one a little bit,” Carroll said. “We’ve got other guys who are doing a nice job back there, and C.J. [Gable]’s a terrific kickoff returner, so we’ll keep that out of [Johnson’s] duties right now.”

The rivalry is finally back where it belongs.
With both USC and Notre Dame entering Saturday’s game ranked in the top 25, there’s a return to normalcy surrounding the annual intersectional clash. But the renewed sense of relevancy goes beyond the little numbers next to each team’s name.
The Trojans head to South Bend, Ind., riding a seven-game winning streak against the Fighting Irish. And save for the famous “Bush Push” game of 2005, the contests haven’t been close — USC has won the last three contests by a combined score of 120-27.
So despite there being three other games between top 25 teams on Saturday’s slate — including the storied Red River Rivalry between Oklahoma and Texas — the match between USC and Notre Dame could be back in the spotlight.
And as usual, there’s no shortage of story lines.
It’s nearly impossible to exhaust the ways to define the non-conference rivalry. But the game isn’t so much about the Midwest against the West or Catholics against, uh, whatever religion you would ascribe to USC (it seems like football is the denomination of choice here).
Saturday’s game will ultimately be defined by the coaches of the two teams. No two teams in college football may be more representative of their top dogs than USC and Notre Dame.
It’s easy to see how USC takes its cues from Carroll. If you made it out to one of the team’s open practices during the bye week, you could tell that the tempo was dictated by Carroll’s mile-a-minute mind. And you only need to listen to true freshman quarterback Matt Barkley drop a few Carroll-isms in a post-game press conference to see that the star and his coach use essentially the same vocabulary.
But Notre Dame and coach Charlie Weis have also taken on resemblance to each other, mostly because of their polarizing status within college football.
One way or another, everyone has an opinion about Notre Dame, no matter how well the team is performing. Similarly, no one will shrug their shoulders when asked what they think of Weis.
No one will ever mistake Weis for being someone who is concerned with others’ opinions of him. That much was clear when he told his players from the outset that they would have a “decided schematic advantage” every game so long as he was at the helm.
Through the highs of 2005 and the lows of 2007 all the way up to the present, Weis has remained a figure embraced by some and ostracized by others. The vitriol for the head coach has been persistent, as evidenced by a billboard reading, “Best wishes to Coach Charlie Weis for the fifth consecutive year of his college coaching internship” being erected in South Bend before the season began.
It’s hard to tell whether Weis’ players have collectively taken on a similar level of brashness toward their coach because Weis puts his team on a media lockdown that would make the CIA proud. But if quarterback Jimmy Clausen’s garish commitment ceremony in 2006 meant anything, the Fighting Irish aren’t short on confidence.
What Weis has given Notre Dame is an ability to bite back. When former coach Tyrone Willingham was in charge, he was able to generate his fair share of wins, but had the fight of the cartoon “Droopy dog.”
Of course, that style has also come back to bite Weis himself, as the last two years left the Fighting Irish with their tails hanging low. But this year’s team seems to have figured out its bearings — the Fighting Irish have won their last three games in tightly contested matches that could have gone either way.
Weis’ polarizing style is also evident on the recruiting trail. More than a few recruits have told stories of being put off by Weis’ approach — USC linebacker Chris Galippo told the Los Angeles Times that the Notre Dame coach didn’t even shake his hand on his official visit to the school. But Notre Dame’s roster features more than a half-dozen players from California and a few out-of-state targets that USC and Carroll wanted.
With so much at stake, each coach’s ego will be at the forefront of Saturday’s game. A win for Weis would be the signature victory of his career so far. Carroll needs a win to keep his team moving forward, but a loss would rile a USC fan base that has forgotten what it is like to lose to Notre Dame in recent years.
So in the words of a trite action movie star, this one is personal.

On a chilly Sunday evening, an audience filled Bovard Auditorium to the balcony, waiting in deliberate anticipation for a performance noted by The New York Times as being “profound and electrifying” —  quite the compliment. But would the performance live up to the already high expectations?
The performer was critically acclaimed sitar virtuoso Nishat Khan, accompanied by an equally proficient tabla player, Abhijit Banerjee. Khan learned his way around the plucked string  instrument as a disciple of his father, Ustad Imrat Khan, becoming a confident player at the tender age of seven and going on to be one of the most skilled and innovative sitarists ever known.
Melodic rifts · Audiences at Bovard got a taste of traditional Hindustani music Sunday with acclaimed sitarist Nishat Khan’s performance. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
But this likely did not matter to much of the crowd that night. After all, how many people know about Hindustani music or even about the sitar itself? Indeed, the music would have to speak for itself.
The concert began with Khan sitting center stage on an elevated platform, flanked on his right by tablaist Banerjee and on his left by a man quietly strumming the strings of his own sitar. Awash in orange light, the master sitarist plucked a chord, then the same chord again, letting the notes drone through the hushed air of the auditorium. Then, hypnotically again and again. Then, a voice: Khan’s voice reverberated through the air, introducing his partners onstage and offering an explanation of Hindi music characteristics, including the importance of the raga, or melodic mode.
“I wanted to bring this music to you,” Khan said.
The chord, again — except it started to shift, evolving into a melody plucked gently and softly. The lulling continued, seeping the tune with its resonating calm, but the melody grew larger, singing out with wistful vibrato applied with skilled assertion. The tabla soon joined in, first with a couple subtle beats and then with greater assertion, the characteristic scooped pitches forming not only a rhythm but a harmony to the sitar.
For the next two and a half hours, Khan and Banerjee performed with the effortless precision of true masters, captivating the audience with an intensely emotional genre of music. It was fascinating in its execution — both sleepily repetitive and beautiful, yet at times explosive beyond words as Khan riotously fired out licks that would be the envy of any musician. The concert was notable for both its vast differences from, yet pertinent similarities to, Western music. At certain moments Khan was even reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton, throwing his head back rapturously, fingers sprinting across the frets with furious energy.
Much of the music was based upon a cyclical motif, jazz-like in its execution and complexity, and ebbing and flowing at the whim of the performers. Sometimes, the melody even dissolved into surprising abstraction. Other times, the songs slowed as the notes became barely audible, practically whispered by the sitar. Whatever was being played, the crowd hung onto each note at every point in the performance, breaking the quiet only with unrestrained applause when an especially climactic portion of the piece was completed.
Undeniably, Khan’s performance was breathtaking.
The music itself was very much foreign from what you might hear at a mainstream concert. It was a testament to the dynamic performance that people sat so enamored; after all, most Americans are not exactly used to nearly hour-long compositions. But the vast majority of the crowd stayed for the whole show, which was a good thing indeed: Khan and Banerjee truly soared to new musical heights after the intermission, pushing the tempos with machine gun tabla strikes and yelping strings. Khan brought out the vocal chops — a very fine baritone — and the sitar became not just an instrument but the manifestation of emotion itself, dictating stories through the impassioned playing onstage. The show ended with a minute-long standing ovation.
Profound, electric and illuminating. These are only three of the many words that could describe what happened inside Bovard Sunday. More than anything, though, the performance truly expressed an intense fusion of the traditional and the contemporary, Eastern and Western, beauty and chaos. And if the reaction was any indication, the audience was not only impressed but touched by the music presented to them.
So did the performance live up to its hype?
Well, you should have been there.

When a child has a condition and modern medicine offers no relief, some parents turn to faith. Others turn to natural healing. When the Isaacsons discovered their autistic son had a connection with horses, they did both.
The documentary The Horse Boy follows the Isaacsons through Mongolia to visit shaman healers. Although the film has directional flaws, the story is a moving, miraculous look at nature and spirituality.
Horsing around · The Horse Boy follows the Isaacsons’ struggle to raise their autistic son, Rowan. The family travels to Mongolia, where Rowan meets shaman healers and discovers his connection with horses. - Photo courtesy of Justin Jin
Science still does not fully understand autism, but its symptoms are all too real. At 5 years old, Rowan Isaacson has hysterical tantrums, obsessive fixations and no toilet training. His parents, Rupert Isaacson, a former journalist and horse trainer, and Kristin Neff, a psychology professor, feel their lives slipping away into their son’s inconsolable condition.
This is until Rupert discovers the one thing that brings Rowan peace — the neighbor’s gentle old mare. Already fascinated by shamanic healing, he finds the one country where horses and shamanism intersect: Mongolia.
Finding no help in modern medicine or psychology, the Isaacsons plunge into the wilds of the Mongolian steppes, travelling on horseback from shaman to shaman, a local guide as their only link to the natives. Their unbelievable journey changed their lives forever.
Commentary from autism experts pepper the moments not involving shamanic rituals and family drama. Apparently, heavy metals, pesticides and divine destiny all cause autism. Although the expert commentary is interesting, it is not incorporated into the film as well as it could be.
The shamans the family visits give the film a unique spiritual aspect. The film does not explain the nuances of the ceremonies beyond their basis in ancestral spirits, but this choice gives some pleasing mystery to the film. Whether it is holistic healing or fresh Mongolian air, something happens to Rowan. It is fascinating to watch his gradual change, such as when he plays with the guide’s young son.
The Isaacsons are very real and empathetic. Rupert’s mix of sarcasm and hope ease the grind of raising an autistic son, such as tantrums stifled by “Code Brown” toilet humor.
Kristin is not as interesting, but her willingness to throw everything aside, follow her husband into the steppes and participate in shamanic rituals makes her very admirable.
But Rowan is easily the most interesting force of the movie.
Whether in an inconsolable rage or playing with a reindeer, infinite possibility hides behind his big blue eyes. One feels the boy has constructed entire kingdoms for when he disappears inside himself. His connection with animals — rabbits act like stuffed animals in his arms — is fascinating to behold.
The camera is very good at catching the intricacies of Rowan, and the intimacy of the shamanic rituals. Never domineering but always sensitive to tone, director Michel Orion Scott has a very clear understanding of what makes the Isaacson’s story one worth telling. A score by Kim Carroll and Lili Haydn is pleasant accompaniment.
Although The Horse Boy delivers a gripping story, it has a few problems.
The interjections by autism experts do little to contribute to the story and distract the film’s focus. If the director wanted to analyze the effects of autism more, he should have just gone for it instead of peppering the story.
Scott is new to documentaries, and it shows. While he captures many powerful moments, the space between them can resemble a slog through a Mongolian rainstorm. Cranky Rowan and muddy hills are effective the first few times, but grow stale.
The film’s pace slips further in the final third, which weakens the miraculous nature of the film’s climax. The resolution, while fascinating to behold, carries an all-too-sweet taste that does not quite go away when the credits roll. It needed a more deft hand and came up a little short.
Despite suffering from editorial choices, the film’s core — this love-bound, weary-but-still-hopeful family — remains a driving force throughout the film.
The Horse Boy offers a penetrating look into the life of a family with a troubled child. It is not a story of autism, a story of horses or even a story of natural healing, but a combination of all three that delivers a unique portrait of a very special boy.

Once you’re a member of the Hollywood club (or the Washington club, for all intents and purposes), you automatically become a target for public scrutiny. In other words, people can rip apart your wardrobe, demand you go on a diet or place you in an imaginary couple without any of your say.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
If you’re walking around with this big fat bull’s-eye on your forehead with the world ready to shoot at any moment, you should probably learn to refrain from doing a few things. For instance, DUIs are pretty bad. And lying. You also shouldn’t get caught laundering money, doing drugs or saying something you know your mother would not be proud of in the vicinity of an open mic.
But even with the generous amount of public slack given for celebrity mistakes and missteps, there’s one rule that those who make it to the big leagues continue to break: Don’t get caught in a sex scandal.
David Letterman obviously did not get the memo, though his punishment has been fairly lax.
Last week, sexual affairs and a poorly thought-out extortion plot (creatively termed “sextortion” by CNN) were splashed all over late night television.
Letterman was blackmailed by Robert Joel Halderman, a producer for the CBS show 48 Hour Mystery. Halderman asked Letterman to fork over $2 million, or he would reveal all the intimate secrets of the several sexual exploits Letterman had with female staff members.
Instead, Letterman went public and gave Halderman a fake check (which eventually led to his arrest), while the public collectively yawned. In an era when Bill Clinton, wayward priests and Republican congressmen gain substantial media coverage for sexploits, the admission — although serious — was not all that shocking.
Maybe it’s because workplace affairs have become a societal vice that is frowned upon yet accepted. According to Vault.com, an online career site, nearly 8 million people engage in at least one romance with a co-worker, with an estimated 50 percent going unreported. A Letterman staffer told the New York Post that the talk show host had a “restricted” room in the Ed Sullivan Theater equipped with a fold-out couch and a kitchen — perfect for the after-show tryst.
A career expert on the site also said that, given the state of economy, workplace romances are likely to increase, as people are dangerously going to more creative lengths to secure their jobs (the site euphemistically cited flirting).
Still, because of this desperation to keep a job as well as the convenience of a workplace romance, the work environment has become a little distracting. The National Organization of Women chose a different word: toxic.
Letterman is also facing backlash from activist groups. NOW is accusing the funnyman of creating a “toxic, inappropriate and hostile work environment for women and employees.” In NOW’s defense, Letterman’s behavior fits the tired affair cliché: the boss that propositions his subordinates.
His abuse of power helped boost the careers of each of the women to whom he was linked, an obvious no-no. Each of Letterman’s office flings were said to have been given huge financial advantages and promotions. As far as being goal-oriented, I’m sure Monica Lewinsky had big career ambitions too.
Looking at the situation in this way, the comedic host merits a more severe punishment than a public wrist slap.
The fact that (work) vacations with his mistress occurred while he was married makes his behavior even less forgivable. Where Letterman is under fire is the fine line between obliging a young intern seeking a promotion and a serious issue of ethics, abuse and potential sexual harassment. Still, the viewers and Letterman’s home network CBS have come rushing to his support, allowing the funnyman to publicly laugh off his shortcomings.
The affable figure is hard to hold a grudge against, and it seems that the general public has moved on — lamenting only that fear of hypocrisy will remove all womanizer jokes from Letterman’s arsenal.

The days of long lines, liquid bans and pat-downs at airport security may come to an end if a new Homeland Security-funded project, the Future Attribute Screening Technology, is successful.
The security system uses sensors to pick up natural signals emanating from bodies, such as heart rate, eye movement, body temperature and breathing rate. The system can analyze the physiological signs and then determine the likelihood that a passenger will commit acts of violence — a revolutionary attempt to reduce the incidence of racial profiling and screener bias at the airport.
Its creators claim it will help TSA agents decipher which individuals need secondary screening, making the entire security process more time efficient. Preliminary tests in which actors played the roles of regular travelers and terrorists have shown the system picked up which individuals were dangerous and needed extra screening 78 percent of the time.
Project managers hope to raise the percentage after analyzing the results of the first tests and want to have the program running error-free and ready for field testing by 2011.
Because FAST is not based on an individual’s physical appearance, but uses biological factors in making its judgment, every passenger is given equal consideration. This would be a triumph for the screening process, as FAST  attempts to remove any possible bias or racial profiling that might be inherent in the current screening system.
The variety of sensors includes many state of the art devices to gather body signals. An electronic sensory balancing board is used for passengers to stand on while being asked questions by security staff.
The system records the movements made on the board and computes them along with other sensory information for the passenger. Other sensors include thermal devices that measure body heat and eye-safe lasers that gather information on a passenger’s rate of blinking and pupil dilation.
Despite the potential success FAST can bring in terms of airport safety, many have voiced concerns over what they see as an invasion of privacy.
“Nobody has the right to look at my intimate bodily functions, my breathing, my perspiration rate, my heart rate, from afar,” said Joe Stanley of the American Civil Liberties Union in an interview with CNN.
Stanley also noted that FAST could potentially reveal physical flaws or illnesses that passengers would rather keep private.
FAST project manager Robert Burns responded to the privacy concerns by saying that the information gathered is not stored or linked to a specific identity, but rather is only revealed to the screener if the information indicates a high threat level.
“We’re looking at signals you give off naturally,” he said in an interview with CNN. “We’re not asking for any personal information. We’re not asking anything about you.”
The TSA is not the only organization coming up with creative answers to security threats. The Los Angeles Times reported Monday that the Transportation Security Laboratory devotes its time to dreaming up easily hidden explosive devices, and figuring out how to test for them in airports.
Since the attacks of 9/11, terrorists have tried using bombs in shoes — which resulted in the requirement that all passengers take off their shoes to have them X-rayed. Terrorists have also tried to smuggle liquid explosives on planes; now there is  a ban on carrying more than 3 oz. of liquid on board.
It has always been security that has modified itself after a threat was exposed, but finally security is thinking ahead, not in retrospect.
In the case of the TSA, however, the technological developments are doubly impressive for their intent to remove personal bias.
FAST is an innovative program that is fit to combat the threats in the 21st century. Rather than stick to old methods of security investigation that center around the use of outdated metal detectors, old-fashioned pat-downs and racial profiling, the methods FAST uses to pick out threatening passengers are based on scientific and bodily evidence.
Unfortunately, airport security today relies somewhat on arbitrary determinants. FAST, on the other hand, has the capability to judge passengers equally based on natural human functions, creating a more objective approach to safety.
It’s time to take the next step in airport security.

The two-week long Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships at the Riviera Tennis Club came to a close this past weekend with an impressive run from the USC women’s tennis team.
Freshman Danielle Lao debuted in her first tournament with the Women of Troy by cruising through the prequalifying and qualifying rounds to advance to the main draw. In the first round on Oct. 8, Lao kept up the momentum and eliminated Texas’ Aeriel Ellis 7-6 (4), 6-2 for her seventh straight win.
“I didn’t feel much pressure to do well, but I did feel some anxiety representing USC for the first time,” Lao said. “Everyone wants to make a good first impression, and I’m just glad I was able to do that and not let the gravity of the event prevent me from playing well.”
The next day, however, Lao was ousted by Tennessee’s Caitlin Whoriskey in a tough three-set match 4-6, 7-5, 6-1.
Meanwhile, sophomore Alison Ramos shrugged off an early first-round loss in the main draw and rebounded with two straight wins in the consolation bracket. Ramos defeated Tennessee’s Natalie Pluskota 7-6 (5), 6-2 to start things off, then secured a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Northwestern’s Maria Mosolova to reach the semifinals, before being knocked out by Fresno State’s Anastasia Petukhova the next day.
The Women of Troy have almost two weeks to prepare for their next tournament. They will begin play Oct. 22 for the 2009 Wilson/ITA Southwest Regional Championships in San Diego.

There are many reasons to be scared about leaving USC housing and fending for yourself in the scary world of independently owned property. Bed bugs! Long bike rides to campus! Mysterious landlords! The inability to instantly access the candy and condoms bucket!
But conversely, there are many reasons to be excited about leaving the protective bubble of the University-own residence halls and apartments. No obligation to eat at EVK! Mysterious landlords! No one to tease you for accessing the candy and condoms bucket!
By far the biggest advantage of getting a non campus owned place though, is the notable absence of fire drills.
The problem with living in close proximity to 500 other college students is that every other night, one of them will inevitably put a metal dish in the microwave, or light aroma therapy candles next to a stack of Daily Trojans or attempt to barbecue their hamburgers in their living room. At one in the morning.
And then the entire building evacuates to the street, hoping for a glimpse at the indescribably stupid culprit responsible for waking them up. Or at least for a glimpse at someone who jumped out of the shower and is standing around in their towel.
Based on anecdotal experience, Troy Hall and Troy East have experienced this problem twice in the last week. Residents there should be advised to take advantage of the candy and condoms bucket while they still can. And to lay of the aroma therapy.
