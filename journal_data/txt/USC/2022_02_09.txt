Following former Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas’s retirement in January, USC announced a nationwide search for the next DPS chief. Associate Senior Vice President of Safety & Risk Assurance Erroll Southers will lead the process along with a 22-person committee that includes students, faculty, staff, community leaders and Spelman Johnson, an external executive search firm. The main objective for the new chief will be to implement the ONE USC Safety Vision report, which the DPS Community Advisory Board released last semester said Southers during a student media briefing Tuesday. 
“It’s going to be very important that, whoever our candidates are, they know those pillars and they can speak to it with some experience and expertise as it relates to accountability, transparency, alternatives to armed response and community care — all in hopes of reimagining and re-envisioning public safety,” Southers said.
The DPS Chief Search Committee will work throughout the spring semester to have a new chief installed by August. The committee began its process by selecting an executive search firm, which Southers said differs from previous search committee processes, in which a firm was preselected. Next, the committee will host six Community Input Sessions open to members of the University community Feb. 14 through Feb. 26.
Two members of the committee will lead the sessions alongside Southers, and each session will include discussions regarding the qualities attendees wish to see in the next chief, challenges they would like to be addressed and changes they would like to see with diversity and community inclusion. Community members will also have the opportunity to answer these questions while facilitators take notes. Once a researcher gathers all the information from the sessions the committee will use a quantitative analysis of the majority of participants’ desire in a chief to guide their process. 
The committee will then evaluate candidates and choose three finalists, who will attend another round for Community Input Sessions. Here, community members will have the opportunity to ask questions to each finalist and determine which one matches their vision of a DPS chief. Although there are no set deadlines, Southers said he hopes these sessions can take place during the beginning of April, with a candidate being chosen at the end of the month.
Southers said he recognizes that the process to find a new DPS chief will be “challenging.” However, he relies on his previous experience in similar processes, such as his participation in searches for multiple deans, to do an “aggressive and comprehensive search.”
“We have a very good opportunity right now to get the best person in the country,” Southers said.
Southers said the new chief would be someone who knows the University community and embraces it. Southers also looks to ensure that the selected person understands how the campus is different from traditional policing. 
“What’s pressing to the USC community is someone who emphasizes community care over enforcement,” Southers said. “We know that we need someone who is going to be able to embrace this community and someone who’s going to prioritize respect and treating people fairly over any other priorities that they may have.”

In the first in-person senate meeting of the semester, members of the Undergraduate Student Government presented new proposals for long-term advocacy projects such as Tilt Los Angeles, a project incubator program to facilitate a collaborative environment for youth to start their own projects and Suit-Up, which will work to provide professional attire for USC students.  
The meeting began with chief programming officer Jessica Minsol Kim’s presentation of new hires and upcoming events. The programming branch introduced new hires Kayla Parayno, a freshman majoring in health and human sciences, as the new assistant director of the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, and Sandy Zhang, a junior majoring in business administration, as the new assistant director of the Transfer Student Assembly. 
Senator Russell Agustin then shared his progression in his long-term project, Tilt L.A., a collaborative project “between the USC and UCLA student governments” that works to jumpstart social change projects in the community.
“[Tilt] is a program that works to get youth thinking about the problems that they face in their society and their community, and to self innovate problem-solving solutions to these issues,” said Agustin in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Agustin is also working on creating a vegan and vegetarian cookbook for students and staff that he hopes will continue as a “universal cookbook that anyone can add to … like a living document” that will be released on the USG website once available. 
“The mission behind the project was [for] anyone … to dip their toe in a green diet if they wish to do so,” Agustin said. “It’s often that we look at a vegetarian or being a vegan as something that’s not doable … Oftentimes, the hardest part is the first step.”
In addition, Agustin looks to pilot an equipment distribution channel with donations of yoga mats and dumbbells that are “easily transportable to local community centers and local high schools.” Agustin is working with USC’s Recreational Sports Center to plan a shoe drive to collect athletic shoes and distribute them to unhoused or underserved communities in the L.A. area to encourage people to “[practice] a healthy lifestyle.” 
USG also confirmed the nomination of their new academic affairs chair David Mkrtchian, a junior majoring in economics. Mkrtchian previously served as a general member in the Faculty Homies & Academic Resource Spotlight and said he looks forward to create a proposal with student input on General Education reform. 
Senator Hunter Hinson then presented a $7,500 funding proposal for the Suit-Up fund, a project that will provide free business attire to 50 students who demonstrate financial need. 
“It’s important to highlight how USG can buy into already established programs and then influence those programs into the direction of students’ priorities,” Hinson said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Hinson said the program is necessary because of a financial burden on students who want to purchase professional attire for events. In his presentation, Hinson said the program would not affect an individual’s financial aid as an additional cost. 
USG will vote on passing the funding proposal and open it up for debate at the next meeting.

USC and Los Angeles County will not presently remove indoor mask mandates despite California state officials announcing Monday that they will lift the mandate for fully vaccinated individuals Feb. 15.
The University follows the strictest government guidelines — in this case, the L.A. County Department of Public Health’s guidelines. L.A. County will look at metrics, including coronavirus transmission and hospitalizations, to evaluate the mandate,  said Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a student media briefing Tuesday.
“We will need to stay aligned with Los Angeles County because that’s actually what we’re subjected to, but overall, what we’re seeing here on campus, in L.A. County and in the state is really reassuring,”  Van Orman said. “Everything is heading in the right direction.”
The University is still looking into whether they will lift their mask mandate in the future, but it is likely they will remain aligned with L.A. County, Van Orman said.
If hospitalization rates remain below the 2,500 mark for a week, L.A. County will lift the mask mandate for large outdoor events, said L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer at a Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday. 
Coronavirus numbers continue to decrease, with a positivity rate of 3.3% for students and 1.9% for employees compared to 5.73% and 4.72% from last week, respectively. 
“We’re still much higher than we were during the fall semester when we had a peak of less than 100 cases a week and a positivity [rate] much less than 0.5%, but, at this point, we’re cautiously optimistic that those numbers are going to continue to trend down in the right direction,” Van Orman said. 
With multiple large public events held in L.A. including the recent NASCAR Busch Light Clash on Sunday and the Super Bowl next weekend, there is currently some concern surrounding transmission at these events, Van Orman said.
The University intends to encourage students attending the Super Bowl to receive vaccinations and boosters while understanding that the risks are decreased because it is an outdoor event and the omicron surge is at significantly lower levels.
“The guidance we’re really issuing to people relative to the Super Bowl, though, is something between the extreme caution we had a year and a half ago and no caution,” Van Orman said.
USC Student Health also recommends masking indoors, staying home when sick and taking rapid antigen tests before attending large events, such as the Super Bowl. Free rapid antigen tests are available through a federal program that allows every household to order four free rapid tests.
The University has made preparations to ensure adequate housing for students needing to quarantine, despite the influx of travelers for the Super Bowl.
Booster rates are also increasing — with nearly 75% of students having received their shots — contributing to the declining positivity rate. 
“It really reflects the combination of the highly vaccinated population, the boosted population, combined with the testing,” Van Orman said. “We’re really just not seeing significant outbreaks among students.” 
This week, USC will notify students who have not received the booster but are eligible to recieve it about holds on their registrations. Van Orman said the University is “strongly” working on getting students boosted. 
“There’s still a lot of misinformation about boosters — that if you had COVID, you don’t need a booster, or that boosters are dangerous —but there’s really great data that just came out about how protective the boosters were, specifically with omicron,” Van Orman said.

Valentine’s Day: you either love it or hate it. Yet, even if you’ve got a hot date or are swearing off the holiday with some of your closest friends, it’s still possible to engage in some of the charm that Feb 14. offers through film. So, curl up with a box of chocolates, either gifted to you or bought discounted on the 15th, and fall in love with one of these iconic romantic comedies. 
“When Harry Met Sally” — HBO Max
Is it possible for men and women to be just friends? Filmmaker and writer Nora Ephron explores this question in the 1989 classic. Featuring Meg Ryan opposite of Billy Crystal, Harry and Sally find themselves serendipitously crossing paths over 12 years. Their budding friendship appears only natural, as audiences can indulge in the quick banter and quips that flow naturally in this script. “When Harry Met Sally” is notable for setting a new gold standard for the rom-com genre which inspired a plethora of tropes in the genre seen even today (e.g. the rise in the desire for the enemies to lovers trope). Dishing out a realistic view of love and the pain it can sometimes elicit, the film features real stories director Rob Reiner collected from elderly married couples on how they met. 
“Notting Hill” — Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, YouTube
“I’m also just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her.” You may recognize this famous line from the 1999 film featuring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Ringing true to the saying “opposites attract,” the film follows a London bookstore owner who finds himself in a whirlwind relationship with American actress/“It Girl” Anna Scott. And even if Roberts and Grant’s effortless banter isn’t enough to satisfy your romantic appetite, you can indulge in the loveliness the setting “Notting Hill” offers. Despite the abundance of turmoil and slow burn these characters face, there is an inherent charm ingrained deeply into its narrative. “Notting Hill” is sure to become one of the newest additions to your comfort movie list. 
“Crazy Rich Asians” — Hulu
Notable for its all-Asian cast and Katherine Ho’s “Yellow” cover, “Crazy Rich Asians” is one of the few examples in which the film equates the quality of the novel it’s based on. Based on Kevin Kwan’s best-seller, New Yorker Rachel Chu is her boyfriend, Nick Young’s, plus one to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore, where it is revealed that his family is incredibly wealthy (hence the title). 
Constance Wu stars alongside Henry Golding and Awkwafina for the reliable comedic relief. You’ll find yourself swooning (or perhaps even crying) over the wedding scene of this film, featuring immaculate costume design, incredible music and tangible chemistry between the actors. 
“13 Going on 30” — Hulu
“Thirty, flirty and thriving,” is what Jenna Rink, the 13-year-old protagonist of “13 Going On 30” wishes for. Much to her disbelief, she wakes up in a 30-year-old’s body, forcing her to navigate adulthood with the mindset of a 13-year-old. 
Portrayed by Jennifer Garner, Jenna perfectly encapsulates adolescent innocence and begins to explore maturity alongside her best friend, Matt Flamhaff (Mark Ruffalo). 
The film, featuring iconic 2000s trends such as funky fashion styles, alludes to the dangers of getting what one wishes for. Garner playfully crafts a character who strongly despises her young age yet experiences an obscene amount of self-induced doubt and regret regarding wishing her life away. This coy fairytale pulls at the audience’s heartstrings, inducing a strong sense of nostalgia within each viewing. 
“Saving Face” — Amazon Prime Video
Adapted from Maya Hu-Chan’s novel, “Saving Face,” based on Hu-Chan’s coming out experience to her Chinese mother, the film features New Yorker/surgeon extraordinaire Wilhelmina, who fears expressing her sexuality and coming out to her traditional Chinese family. 
This fear is challenged directly in light of meeting Vivian, her future love interest, which Wilhelmina conceals from her own mother, who also is tangled up in her own romantic storyline. Wilhelmina must deal with the gripes of exploring new corners of her identity to stagnate her growth due to her mother’s conservatism. “Saving Face” is recognizable for its all-Asian American cast and as a hallmark in the LGBTQIA+ representation environment.  
“10 Things I Hate About You” — Disney+
Did you ever find reading Shakespeare a drag? Never fear, “10 Things I Hate About You,” the ‘90s rom-com classic, based on “The Taming of the Shrew,” features annoying loveable characters that will make you return to this film for an occasional rewatch. 
Inspired by the Shakespearean story, Kat (Julia Stiles) and Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) clash over their father’s strict romantic rules, leading Bianca to attempt to set Kat up with their high school’s resident bad boy, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). 
This teen comedy features one of the most popular rom-com tropes of all time, a public declaration of love, during which Kat finds herself serenaded on her high school’s football field. Ledger’s dance number during this unforgettable scene concots an undeniable charm, making the film quintessential for your Valentine’s Day viewing.

February 1 marked the beginning of the Lunar New Year, celebrated by Asian families and communities worldwide. For me, it’s a great way to get connected to my roots and to keep traditions alive. 
Unlike the Gregorian calendar, the Lunar New Year is driven by sun and moon phases, signifying the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Each year is celebrated according to a 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac paired with a cycle of five elements: fire, earth, metal, water and wood. The animals are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig.
2022 is the year of the Water Tiger, an animal which symbolizes leadership, courage, strength, power and ambition. The last Water Tiger year occured 60 years ago in 1962, and is characterized by strong interpersonal relationships and a goal of doing what’s best for all, not just oneself.
Different countries celebrate with their own rich traditions, and the celebration usually lasts 16 days. In Vietnam, sticky rice cakes called bánh chung are enjoyed while in Malaysia, yeesang, a dish of vegetables and raw fish, adorn the dinner table. Here in the United States, we celebrate with dragon parades, boat races and fireworks. Red and gold, associated with prosperity, is a common theme in clothing, lanterns and envelopes filled with money given as a sign of luck and good fortune. 
Although there are many wonderful parts of the holiday, my favorite part of the Lunar New Year is the food. 
As a child, my family would go to dim sum on Sundays, and culinary delights ranging from shrimp dumplings to mini egg tarts to char siu bao and shumai would fill my greedy stomach. I recall being eight years old and noticing how important food was in bringing my family together. My family would think of every excuse to fill our dinner table, and Lunar New Year was one of them.
The holiday’s traditional menu is very intentional, offering different dishes that each have their own significance. For instance, Longevity noodles, or chang shou mian, are a fun tradition — longer noodles represent a longer life! The long noodle must be eaten entirely, as legends have it otherwise, a broken noodle means a shorter life.
Steamed whole fish signifies abundance. The word for fish, or “yu,” is the same word for surplus. The new year blessing, “nian nian you yu,” translates to “may you have a surplus (of food and money) every year.”
Chinese dumplings, jiǎo zi, are significant in letting go of the old and bringing in the new. Fried golden spring rolls typically filled with pork, shrimp, vegetables or beef signify gold bars, which is a sign of wealth and prosperity. 
The tray of togetherness is a dish served in a circular tray divided into either six or eight compartments, each representing peace and family harmony. The lucky numbers six and eight signify good fortune. The tray is filled with nuts, chocolate gold coins, fruits, candies and treats to open the year to abundance and bounty, and are offered to welcome friends and family who visit. Its emphasis on connectedness and being surrounded by loved ones embodies the spirit and tradition of the new year.
My tray of togetherness was made by Pearl River Deli in Chinatown and contained six items: fried lotus chips, candied walnuts, mochi filled with peanuts, almond cookies, shortbread and sesame pumpkin brittle. A traditional loose leaf hot green tea from Tea Master in Little Tokyo was the perfect pairing to these amazing treats shared with family, friends and neighbors. In times when I am away from family, it always warms my heart to keep this tradition alive with friends, and it’s always a fun excuse to see each other.
In the spirit of Lunar New Year, regardless of what is at your table, here’s to a celebration of connectedness with each other through traditions new and old. Let’s welcome the Year of the Tiger in all its glory and abundance. Gong Hei Fat Choy!

Happy Valentine’s Day to all, even those without Valentines. Whether you got chocolates, gave chocolates or just bought chocolates (a perfectly valid option), Valentine’s Day is about more than the delicious delicacies. 
Although this year’s Valentine’s Day might look a little different, don’t let masks and coronavirus protocols prevent you from celebrating — whatever that means for you. 
Whether you head out on an incredible date or stay at home with your roommates, the perfect soundtrack elevates every moment. Spend the day relaxing and calming yourself down through an emotional rollercoaster of sweet melodies (while you eat as much chocolate as your heart desires).
“Can’t Help Falling In Love” (Cover by Kina Grannis from “Crazy Rich Asians”)
Picture an aisle filling with water and a beautiful silence before a stunning bride mesmerizes the guests with her graceful walk towards the altar under an array of butterflies and fireflies.
All of this is encapsulated by the soft voice of Kina Grannis and her guitar as she sings her rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling In Love” in the 2018 film “Crazy Rich Asians.”
Use Valentine’s Day as the perfect excuse to express your affections for someone and feel the love Grannis sings about in her version of the classic song. 
Forget what wise men say, it’s absolutely alright to fall in love on Valentine’s Day.
“10,000 Hours” (Dan + Shay, Justin Bieber)
You may only have 24 hours in a day, but you will always have 10,000 hours and 10,000 more in the spectrum of love. 
Affection may be timeless if we don’t hesitate and doubt ourselves before giving up talking to that special someone due to our fear of rejection. Life would be easier if you could casually sing the questions in a gentle, subtle way. That’s what Justin Bieber did with Dan + Shay in this charming serenade. While we, unfortunately, can’t all do the same, pluck up the courage to devote 10,000 hours to being a bolder person and asking that special someone out on a date. 
“It’s You” (Henry)
Ever felt like you’ve met the one? Want to follow your heart and pursue them but are nervous to do it? Henry sings about the captivating bliss of falling in love with his destiny. While he is overwhelmed by his own emotions to fall in love too fast, he calls for the one he calls his own. 
If you feel too caught up in your own emotions on this special day, just remember that Henry wrote a whole song about his destiny and it wasn’t for Valentine’s Day, so pull down the blinds and wear your headphones to listen to this ambient experience of a heartache. And maybe when you are done, reach out to that special someone and ask them on a date. 
“All Of The Stars” (Ed Sheeran from “The Fault In Our Stars”)
A truly picturesque vision of a starry night unfolds through the lyrics of this song. Is this warm embrace of a song enough to make you believe in a brighter tomorrow? Maybe. But it is certainly enough to make you think about falling in love.
Ed Sheeran reminds you of a distant, yet spiritually close, soulmate with whom you can share the same night sky. The night sky stretches across horizons to hold all the scars and nostalgia of a thousand, but returns wondrous gifts to a billion.
“Answer: Love Myself” (BTS)
Don’t have a Valentine? That’s completely fine! Be your own Valentine by loving yourself on this special day. You don’t need validation from others to know your worth. Don’t doubt yourself because you didn’t get a box of chocolates – it’s a marketing scheme preying on low self-esteem. Read into the lyrics of this song because all your flaws and insecurities are your own constellations and everyday, you just have to learn to love yourself. Appreciate your personal being because you are the main character of the film that is life.
“Enchanted” (Taylor Swift)
How can we leave out Taylor Swift on Valentine’s Day? Don’t worry, we won’t. “Enchanted” takes us back to an era of childhood heartbreaks and first greetings. With social media conjuring up new words, we’ve forgotten how exquisite language can penetrate our emotional depths. Swift gracefully sings a nostalgic story of magical first encounters with an elegant choice of words. Let’s hope you can tell your Valentine that “it was enchanting to meet you.”

USC women’s lacrosse will kick off its season with a home game against non-conference San Diego State at 1:00 p.m. Saturday at Soni McAlister Field.
The Trojans ended their last season with a 9-7 record and finished as the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 going into the postseason. Their season ended at the Pac-12 tournament semifinals in a close game, losing 9-8 to Colorado.  Though they did not make it as far as they wanted in the tournament, the team is looking to build off of the momentum they had from their 2021 season, starting this weekend. 
“[The team] has been able to develop such an amazing culture so far and we’ve pushed each other so hard all throughout fall,” graduate midfielder and team captain Kelsey Huff said. “Being able to see all that hard work and blood, sweat and tears pay off is what I’m most excited for.”
The Trojans are led by Head Coach Lindsey Munday, who is currently in her 10th year in charge. This year, she brought on two new assistant coaches to join her staff: Lauren Gunning and Asa Goldstock. Prior to USC, Gunning spent seven seasons as an assistant lacrosse coach at her alma mater UCONN and three seasons as an assistant coach at Cincinnati. Goldstock kicks off her first season coaching after finishing up a goalkeeping career with Syracuse in 2021, leading the team to the NCAA Championship Game. 
USC has graduated 10 women from their 2021 squad including Izzy McMahon, who led in total points for the 2021 season, and Riley Hertford, All-American goalie. Additionally, the Trojans lost three players to the transfer portal. With the loss of several players from their prior season, USC will look for new difference-makers this year. 
For starters, USC will see three new faces at the goalkeeper position: incoming freshman Mia Fleming and two transfers, graduate student Elyse Darcy from Iona and sophomore Kait Devir from Boston College. Graduate student attacker Maggie Root from Maryland Also joins the Trojans from the transfer portal. Several key players are returning to the team as well,  including Huff and Pac-12 Freshman of the Year midfielder Madison Waters. USC also brought in 12 new freshmen this season. 
With around half of their roster composed of new players, this season, USC’s side will need time to settle in and adjust to the roster turnover. The new additions are leaning on veteran players to learn the ropes.  
“It’s been awesome,” Munday said. “The young girls and the transfers have brought their own personality and style. It’s really a good combination of support from the older girls but then the younger players really bringing that intensity and the fun atmosphere to practice and our everyday life on the field.”
Having played in 60 games for the Trojans throughout her career, Huff said that she recognizes what the incoming players have to offer compared to previous seasons.
“I think all the freshmen and transfers have brought so much energy and intensity,” Huff said. “They’re such a high-level class. It’s just going to be an entirely different team dynamic and performance. I’m super excited to let them do their thing.”

February is synonymous with one thing: Valentine’s Day. Whether you have a special someone to share a sushi roll with or your plans involve being snug and alone listening to Mitski, the holiday is one that shows that love is malleable to everyone’s needs. It’s about self-love as much as it is about sharing your admiration for a stranger you just met on Tinder. 
However, or whoever you decide to celebrate with, Dr. Blingspice is here to help you with all your Valentine’s problems, from sex to newfound crushes.
My boyfriend and I are sexually incompatible and it’s causing major issues. I feel like I’ve tried everything to keep it spicy, but he just doesn’t seem interested. What can I do to reinvigorate this area of our relationship?
While sexual compatibility shouldn’t be on the highest pedestal of a relationship, it can still make or break your beloved Valentine’s Day plans. Think about how unhappy a romantic union would be if the only thing your sexual tension and “You look good tonight”’ has amounted to was a brief, anti climactic hug.
To avoid your relationship resulting in cobwebs, confrontation is the only fix. That’s not to say you should tell him he’s an utter disappointment for not pleasuring you, but instead discuss what you are each looking to gain from your sex lives. If it’s a leather kink or bondage that ends up tying the relationship together, then you’ve resolved the problem.
If you don’t find the kink that makes the bed clink, it might be time to reconsider the relationship. Even if the pros of being with your boyfriend outweigh the lack of pleasure you find in sex, the fact that you’re submitting your sexual frustration to random Google Forms makes it clear that it’s a concern. Sexual chemistry isn’t something that can be easily  fabricated, and unless he decides to work with you to find a bond, it might be time to find another Valentine.
I really value my abstinence and want to stay a virgin. How can I avoid sex at USC?
Prudish girl winter participants must overcome their most difficult challenge yet this month. Virgin to a virgin: it’s not that difficult to avoid sex at USC. While it is a relatively attractive student body, and unholy thoughts might come to mind, think about all the excitement you can have doing your course readings instead. Who needs sex when you can read the “Aeneid” instead?
You should be the only person responsible for your sexual journey, and if you choose to spend Valentine’s Day with your fellow virgin sisters at Bible study, there’s no shame in that. The holiday is about love. In the case that you choose to celebrate by loving God and your abstinence or you accidentally succumb to devilish temptations and commit sinful acts, what matters is that your sex life is in your control.
So I recently got out of a relationship, and I am in the healing process, trying to fully understand all that happened in the relationship and how to move forward in a healthy way. But, I’ve rekindled a relationship with an old friend, and I’m confused as to whether or not I want to try and pursue something romantic with them. We have (platonic) plans for Valentine’s Day, but I’m not sure how to proceed!
Out with the old, in with the new. The way you bring in the new, however, is more important than anything, especially considering it’s an old friend.
Step one is to figure out if the interest is mutual. To gauge the feeling, do things that could be questionably perceived as either romantic or platonic. Give them a hug that’s strangely too long to make them overthink. Give them a compliment on their looks that could either be read as hyping a friend up or something to make them blush. 
The goal is to keep the person rolling in bed at night, confused and unsure of where you stand, until they’re forced to confront you to stay sane. Given they bring up the conversation first, you save yourself from any embarrassment if it’s truly meant to be platonic. You’ll also be in full control over the situation and have the ability to decide if you want to pursue a romantic relationship or not. 
Make sure to squeeze in as many mixed signals as you can, and stay as sexy and mysterious as possible.

The name “City of Angels” becomes particularly ironic once you take to the roads as a driver for the first time, or even just observe from the passenger seat. Los Angeles, a city known for its car and driving culture, almost seems to be in total spite of it. The roads, already plagued with potholes and an unforgiving lack of protected left turns, are filled with short-tempered and egotistical drivers. With this comes the occasional driving incident fueled by some neurological or chemical thing in the mind simply called “road rage.”
Road rage can be described as “aggressive driving … like tailgating, weaving and speeding,” according to that green gecko that runs Geico. 
Personally speaking, I believe this form of anger can be derived from a person who decides to forget everything they learned in driving school. However, road rage can come from a generally poor day, traffic delays, resentment of the law or pure disregard for other people.
For those who don’t drive, think of that time when the venom symbiote takes over Tobey Maguire in “Spider-Man 3,” when Peter Parker suddenly becomes a real asshole.
Your foot slowly begins to press further down on the pedal and your grip on the wheel becomes tighter. Your eyes begin blitzing back and forth from mirror to mirror to see where to accelerate toward. The hunkering piece of metal and wires that was once your car becomes a wrecking ball coming ever so close to destruction. The commute transforms into a pursuit of something greater than simply getting from point A to point B — now it’s a test challenging your pride. 
It’s a real, incredibly frightening state of being that is anything but homeostasis.
But, more importantly, this mindset presents a clear and immediate danger to others on the road. Whether we would like to admit it or not, we begin to act irrationally — overreacting to other drivers’ subtle mistakes that we’ve also made before. 
Road rage and reckless driving, which is usually what road rage is constituted as under law, often go hand-in-hand. A person who would rather piss in their bathroom than in the comfort of their own car may begin to drive recklessly, something that may progress to road rage if they encounter traffic or stoppages on the road.
You’re making your way en route to the University when suddenly, another driver zips into your lane, almost dinging your car. You swerve, slam your hand on the horn and get back to your senses. Unscathed physically but angered emotionally, you continue your commute. 
Poof! Two tiny beings pop on your shoulders, and you are presented with two options, of which I will denote as Lewis and Lois — my personal alter egos carried over from “Back in My Day.” 
Lewis urges you to really tap into that anger, derived from a terrible day in class, a bad conversation with a friend or running into an ex. Simply said, floor it. Get in front; brake check them. Then, weave through lanes like your grandmother knitting you a sweater for Christmas as you hightail it out of there.
Lois sits you down for that sort of fatherly chat, insisting you think of what that person might be going through. Patience is a virtue, albeit not commonly practiced, but still one nonetheless. Take it slow a bit, catch your breath, maybe play some tunes to get you back in the right mood.
That’s not to say we’re always perfect, either. Drivers eventually succumb to the Lewis within and take the figurative low road. Honestly, that’s OK. 
However, from a more existential perspective, I, Lois, implore you to think about who or what you make the commute for. Remember the people that you might’ve shared a ride with, the moments of joy and pure euphoria derived from experiences in your car and the people, pets or space waiting for you once you park and get out of the car. I remember the times I spent with my friends in my car. Those recollections of gossip or fun conversation keep me sane and also keep my foot from pressing too hard on the accelerator. Remember, there’s a lot more to life than being able to salvage your pride after someone cuts you off.
Commute safely, besties.

The very first football games were played in front of few spectators and were likely lackluster in their game production capabilities. Today, football game’s offer an immersive experience: From giant jumbotrons featuring fans at random and lively PA announcers entertaining the crowd during lulls in the game, a lot goes into a day at a football stadium. 
But with all the sporting event’s fanfare comes a great deal of energy usage, which can be harmful during a time of extreme climate vulnerability. 
During moments of peak demand on game days in Dallas, the Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium uses 10 megawatts of energy. This fact, uncovered by the Wall Street Journal, went viral in 2013 when the news outlet reported that AT&T Stadium’s energy capacity was three times the size of Liberia’s. 
This might be more math than a sports column should get into, but 10 megawatts is a lot. It’s enough to power about 3,600 homes. This much power makes for a great gameday experience, but what effect does it have on the climate? 
The answer: not a great one. The average American household produces around 16 tons of carbon dioxide per year. This suggests that huge stadiums such as AT&T have the ability to pump out carbon at insanely high rates. 
New venues such as SoFi Stadium, the home of the 2022 Super Bowl, wowed the sports world with their elegant designs and impressive amenities. SoFi also boasts its energy efficiency and environmentally friendly practices.
For instance, the roof of SoFi Stadium — made up of several operable panels — can open to allow free airflow and hot air to escape. This allows the stadium to be at a comfortable temperature even when at capacity. Most stadiums stay cool with energy-consuming air conditioning systems. SoFi figured out a way to cut that cost. 
The gold standard of energy-efficient stadiums is Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena, home of the Seattle Kraken and the Seattle Storm. 
Climate Pledge Arena employs 100% sustainable energy, all electric operations and composting and recycling programs, among other environmentally-friendly practices. Their ice hockey rink is made up of recycled rainwater, captured in a gigantic 15,000 gallon underground cistern. 
The Arena was founded on the principles of The Climate Pledge, an international agreement between 217 businesses to reach net zero carbon by 2040, a mere 19 years from now. 
Now, CPA isn’t perfect. It still contributes to the production of methane and other harmful gasses. It also runs in partnership with Amazon, whose activity produced the equivalent of 60.64 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2020, a 19% increase compared to 2019. Remember, the average American household produces 16 tons per year. But committing to carbon neutrality is really the least that stadiums, organizations and companies can do. 
*steps on soapbox* 
The release of methane and other greenhouse gasses is causing the ozone — the layer of our atmosphere that protects us from the sun and the reason we are alive to read the Daily Trojan today — to deteriorate. Methane can be emitted in thousands of ways: the construction of concrete, the burning of fossil fuels and the powering of an air conditioning system to name a few. 
To preserve the world that we have inhabited for the past two million years or so, we must come up with creative solutions to the climate crisis. Sports arenas present an interesting case study. How can other buildings emulate SoFi’s natural air conditioning system? How can corporations or even towns use water more efficiently, like CPA? 
It’s easy to become jaded about the future of our climate. It’s an inherently negative subject to think about and easy enough to ignore, for now. However, it is perhaps the most important issue we will face in our lifetimes and will affect everyone in ways big or small. 
Stadiums such as SoFi and CPA can start a conversation. Sports must adapt to a changing climate and serve the earth more effectively by taking into consideration their carbon footprint. There are plenty of ways to use clean energy and opportunities to research efficient climate-friendly solutions. 
While achieving net zero emissions is essentially an impossible task, the push for carbon neutrality is vital to slow down the concerning changes in weather and climate patterns. Sports teams, as billion-dollar companies, have a responsibility to their fans, surrounding communities and world to cut back on carbon emissions in any way possible.
