Celebrating a win over UCLA was the best way to spend Thanksgiving weekend. Photo contributed by Alina Tang | Daily Trojan
This Thanksgiving, I chose to stay in Los Angeles instead of going home to Seattle. Though it would have been amazing to see my family and sleep in my own bed for a few days, I felt like I just had to soak up my senior year and experience “College Friendsgiving” for the first and last time.
My Thanksgiving break started out with an impromptu trip to San Diego with a few friends. We got up early Thursday morning to beat the traffic and arrived in Old Town for lunch. By noon, we were seated in Café Coyote, which we later found out was voted The Best Mexican Restaurant in San Diego for the last 15 years. Now I am no food connoisseur, but I can definitely vouch for Café Coyote’s fish tacos, and I recommend it to anyone else visiting the area.
After lunch, my friends and I ventured to La Jolla and enjoyed the light breeze and ocean views. We even walked up to some seals that looked like they were also recovering from a huge meal of fish tacos. I don’t think I have ever stood that close to so many seals. At one point I actually thought one of them would slap me. It was a treat to see them all sprawled together over the rocks, as if they were enjoying the holiday with their family and friends too.
The day concluded with us rushing back to Los Angeles so we could celebrate Thanksgiving properly with a home-cooked meal. We all chipped in and whipped up our best dishes. I baked a salmon using a special recipe my Mom always prepares back home, and my friend, who is a much better cook than I, roasted a turkey and made mashed potatoes. Though the turkey ended up taking four hours, and we didn’t eat it until 11 p.m., I would say it was still a very successful Friendsgiving after all.
However, the best part of my Thanksgiving break came on Saturday at my last undergraduate game day. Since I’ve been in college, USC has not been able to beat UCLA in football. More than ever before, I wanted the Victory Bell to return to where it belongs. So this year, I decided I had to witness the game firsthand. Despite going to a concert the night before, my friends and I dragged ourselves up at 10 a.m. to enjoy our last tailgate on campus. We stopped at multiple tents, caught up with familiar faces and stocked up on as many drinks and snacks before the game started.
Around noon, we spilled into the stadium and snagged a prime location to watch kickoff. The next few hours were incredible, with a bunch of us on the edge of our seats and some of us standing and cheering the whole time. Every time we scored a touchdown, I leapt up and high-fived everyone around me, even strangers. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so excited and giddy, especially around the end of third quarter when we had a significant lead. It started to hit me that we might actually take the win, so my friends and I moved down a few rows in case we were able to storm the field.
When we finally made our last touchdown in the fourth quarter, I knew we had the game in the bag. I could feel my heart swelling with pride and everyone around me feeling the same way. For USC, this season has been anything but smooth, but amid all the detours and setbacks, our team has pulled through. It’s been a crazy roller coaster — a whirlwind of a ride — but the last touchdown was the exhilarating drop that sealed the deal. I feel so blessed to have witnessed such an amazing game with my closest friends — people I’ve known since my freshman year. Though I was hundreds of miles away from home, I’m grateful I was able to celebrate Thanksgiving this way and spend the holiday with my second family — my Trojan family.

At home over Thanksgiving break, freshman blogger Rebecca Katz was able to reunite with her high school friends. Photo contributed by Rebecca Katz | Daily Trojan.
There is a lot of hype over coming home for the first time as a freshman.
Some come back from across the country, excited to finally sleep in their own bed after traveling on two planes, two busses and an Uber.
Some just have a quick (or not so quick due to obscene amounts of traffic) trip down the 10, but no matter where you’re coming from, returning home after three months of college is a little jarring.
Let’s start with the family. While we all like to believe we are full-fledged adults now — that we can come home as late as we please and whip up our own gourmet dinners of cinnamon toast crunch — when we really face the facts we are still just teenagers.
For many of us, our parents still make our dentist appointments for us and no matter how hard we protest, when we come home from college all of the same old rules that we thought we had bid farewell to will apply.
“Text when you leave the house, text when you get to your final destination, text when you’re safe in bed, text the name of every single person you interact with in the next two hours, might as well throw in 17 more texts to let me know you’re still safe in the three mile radius you’ve traveled tonight. Oh, but don’t text while you’re driving … it’s dangerous.”
So we’ve clearly established that all our new, beautiful collegiate freedoms have been ripped away from us. We’re left standing on the street corner, empty-handed — no car, waiting for an Uber to take you to the mall as you text your mom that yes, you are still indeed safe from the last time she asked, approximately 13 minutes ago.
However, the real hype around coming home is seeing your friends, your classmates, having that awkward high school “reunion,” if you can even call it that after only three months apart.
At the inevitable reunion there are the blatantly awkward people who have always been awkward, clinging to their phones in a corner pretending to be engaged in some text while suspiciously looking up every few seconds to see who’s around.
There are the people who are “too cool” now that they’re in college. They come to the party, but then they walk around judging the music and social interactions because yes, frat parties are so much more mature.
There are the people who are way too into it, having consumed far too much alcohol for a high school “reunion,” greeting people a little too loudly and bear hugging everyone they see.
And then there’s you, having a conversation with someone you never thought you’d see again, already having run into two ex-boyfriends, and having asked the question, “How’s college?” approximately 14 times.
It’s been 20 minutes and all you want to do is leave, but leaving will make you seem obnoxious and high maintenance, and you keep hoping the night will somehow turn out to be great.
So coming home is not looking too hot. Between the awkward run-ins with exes and overbearing parents, you’re ready to go back to school, but I think even with all of this there is something comforting in the craziness of home.
When you go away to college, people make it seem like life as you know it is over. While day-to-day life is definitely different, coming home makes you realize that’s not true at all.
You come home and you realize it’s all still there — the best friends, the crazy parents, the high school drama.
Perhaps the only reason it may be weird is because you are able to look at the situation differently, with a new perspective.

Still holding a grudge about my cousin eating the rest of the apple pie. Charlotte Wulff | Daily Trojan
Ever since I started my exchange semester here at USC, I have been super excited to experience a real Thanksgiving with the American branch of my family. After a sketchy Greyhound bus ride to Las Vegas — during which the bus driver and a woman started yelling at each other and security had to escort the woman off the bus — and another day of road tripping with my aunt and uncle, I made it to Wally’s Hot Springs in Nevada.
Based on my first Thanksgiving, this is my reflection on what giving thanks like a real ’Murican is all about.
Thanksgiving is about being with family. Especially when this means squeezing nine people into a two-bedroom cabin. Luckily, my cousin and her husband did not live too far away so they could go home every night and come back the next morning. However, they did grab the opportunity to get a few good nights of sleep by leaving their adorable little kids, who wake up at five in the morning and then want to play, with us in the cabin. We eventually worked out sleeping arrangements, with some minor aggressions, and then had ourselves a grand ol’ time of hanging out together. We retold childhood stories, played guitar and sat outside in the hot springs while it was snowing.
Thanksgiving is about food and drenching everything in cheese. My U.S. family is normally very health-conscious, but one night a year, that all goes out the window. I estimate that at least half my Thanksgiving dinner consisted of food covered in melted cheese, and I had bacon with pretty much every meal. I honestly think that some of my family members were enjoying the mac ‘n cheese and cheesy broccoli more than the impeccably prepared turkey.
Thanksgiving is about being slightly but continuously intoxicated. The trick is to start early (noon at the latest) and spread your drinks over the day to keep your blood-alcohol content in that magical sweet spot where you love everyone and everything but can still stay classy. Our only slip-up was when my cousin’s husband, who used to be a bartender, made us a mixed drink that turned out to be much stronger than it tasted. This resulted in the yelling of a few obscenities and a lot of laughter. He then ate the remaining third of the delicious looking apple pie that my aunt had made and I had not tasted yet while I was gone for half an hour. I still hold a grudge.
Finally, Thanksgiving is about mentioning the pilgrims and Native Americans once, and then wondering whether they ate turkey back in the day and, if not, what they did eat and where the turkey tradition came from (seriously where did it come from?). I expected us to follow a type of ceremony that you see in movies, in which everyone says what they are thankful for. This did not happen. Instead, we just devoured turkey and cheesy things like there was no tomorrow and philosophized about it afterwards.
I spent about four days travelling for three days of family fun and cheese, but it was totally worth it. I have to say though, I am pretty happy to spend some quiet time by myself after this family overload and sleep deprivation. Now, it is nap and detox time.
