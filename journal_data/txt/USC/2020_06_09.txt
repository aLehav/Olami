When 2020 graduate Laura Montilla and her friends joined protesters in downtown Los Angeles, she didn’t expect the long night ahead of her — an experience she would later describe as “inhumane.”
On June 1, Montilla participated in a protest that began at Los Angeles City Hall. According to Montilla, while the protest was initially peaceful, she and her friends found the Los Angeles Police Department cornering the blocks once the updated 5 p.m. curfew had passed.
From May 30 to June 4, L.A. County issued citywide and countywide curfews to “preserve public safety during these hours,” abiding by Government Code Section 8634. Under curfew, residents are ordered to stay off public streets and remain in their homes, while “peace officers, fire fighters and National Guard or other military personnel deployed to the areas” — among others — are exempt from the order. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, the city and county initially imposed a 6 p.m. curfew June 1. At 3:44 p.m., an alert went out on mobile phones noting a change in the citywide curfew to 5 p.m., and the city’s website was updated as well. However, even though L.A. County confirmed on Twitter at 4:24 p.m. that the mobile alert was sent in error, Montilla saw cops jumping on and tasing protesters who were trying to flee shortly after 5 p.m. 
While her friends were able to leave, Montilla found herself zip-tied and caged in with other protesters on a bus. Police searched her belongings, grabbing her crotch and breasts in the process. To Montilla, it was clear the cops had a “lack of protocol” in their arrests at the protests; for the next several hours, she was left with no knowledge of her rights, where she was going and when she could go back home.  
“At that moment, I was like … I’m going to do everything I can to show that I’m compliant and not a threat,” Montilla said. “I was like, surely it won’t be too hard, and I realized that that was not a reality pretty soon.”
Montilla is one of the hundreds of USC students who have participated in demonstrations across the country against police brutality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, as well as one of several who have gotten arrested or detained by police in the process. Due to her interactions with LAPD, Montilla aims to spread awareness about the realities of police brutality. 
“What I experienced is like such a small scale of what the Black community has faced and faces,” Montilla said. “Really what my experience with LAPD showed me was the police I encountered did what they did because they are protected by a system that has no accountability, provides no incentive for law enforcement … and is inherently racist.”
Detained for hours
Cuffed and caged in the dark for hours, Montilla said everyone on the bus was shaken. 
According to Montilla, the bus was parked at a cemetery parking lot for nearly five hours, and throughout that time, people began to experience panic attacks and urinate themselves.
When they were finally let off of the bus at midnight, Montilla, dead phone in hand, found herself abandoned with other young protesters in an unknown neighborhood. She was able to get a ride from a stranger and returned home safely at around 12:40 a.m. 
“I pray no one was kidnapped that night,” Montilla shared on Instagram June 4. The post went viral with more than 400,000 likes, grabbing the attention of thousands of students as well as celebrities like “Riverdale” actress Lili Reinhart, who has been interviewing activists in the Black Lives Matter movement the past week. Montilla went on Reinhart’s Instagram Live on June 6 to talk about the incident.
Fellow 2020 graduate Kayla Soren shared a similar experience in her arrest on the night of the June 2 protest that began in front of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s residence. According to Soren, when the media was present, the police staged a publicity stunt: Cops marched in unison with the Black protesters, concluding the march with a hug between a Black man and a cop.
While the city imposed a 6 p.m. curfew that night, Soren said the police announced that since the demonstration was peaceful, she and the other protesters could stay past 6 p.m. Police and media left the scene, and Soren and her friends continued to demonstrate.
Half an hour later, police returned, outnumbering the protesters nearly 2-to-1, corralling them to gunpoint at Crenshaw Boulevard and West 8th Street. No media was present.
“It was just complete fear-mongering,” Soren said. “The cops just immediately pointed all of their guns to our heads, surrounded us on all sides, didn’t have their body cameras on and were laughing at us.”
That night, Soren was loaded into cages on a bus with her hands zip-tied. According to Soren, some protesters had to burn their own zip-ties with a lighter because they had lost blood circulation. At 1:30 a.m., Soren and her friend were finally let off the bus in San Pedro with a $1,000 citation for violating curfew.
“I still feel lucky because there are other stories that are so much worse, and Black women are definitely treated far worse than I am as a white woman,” Soren said. “Just because the amount of fear and straight up terrorism that I felt from the police, I can’t imagine what it’s like being a Black person in America.”
In Chicago, rising junior Enrique Delgado and his twin brother Eder walked through predominantly Black neighborhoods in an act of solidarity. During the walk, Enrique held a bus sign he found two years ago on which he taped “Black lives matter” on one side and “Fuck 12” on the other. When two patrol cars trailed the two and flashed their lights during their march, Enrique immediately panicked. The precinct was known for violence as well as racial profiling, he said.
While walking home, Enrique and Eder were arrested and held in a jail cell at the nearest police station for 12 hours, including two hours in the interrogation room.
“They seriously kept trying to intimidate us, but we were not having it,” Enrique said. “I don’t know why they kept doing it, like we weren’t going to change our views … They just kept telling us their opinion, which obviously we didn’t care about, and that’s when they put us in holding cells.”
Next steps
When Enrique and Eder were released the following morning, they were notified that they were charged for theft and defacing public property with the bus sign, with bail set at $1,500 each. Although their court date is set for July 28, the two quickly paid it off via crowdfunding.
Even though Enrique grew up frequently witnessing acts of police brutality in his neighborhood, being directly targeted by police was nothing like he had expected. However, Enrique said he and Eder are even more motivated to stand in solidarity with Black lives and continue to join demonstrations.
“There’s probably a little bit of trauma … but at the end of the day, it’s not going to silence us,” Enrique said. “I was thinking of this Mexican revolutionary’s quote: ‘Prefiero morir de pie que vivir de rodillas,’ which means ‘I’d rather [die] on my feet than [live] on my knees.’”
Similarly, Soren and Montilla are doing their part in promoting awareness. Along with joining more demonstrations, Soren has been sharing her experience with family and friends and plans to pitch an editorial to the L.A. Times on police’s presence at protests. 
For Montilla, once she posted on Instagram, several protesters reached out to her with similar experiences with their arrests. Additionally, the University and President Carol Folt reached out to Montilla. On Tuesday, Montilla said she met with Folt again to connect her with her friends at the Black Student Assembly, who have a list of demands for Folt to meet. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Folt said she received thousands of letters about Montilla’s “horrifying” story and reached out to Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas and LAPD Chief Michel Moore to launch an independent investigation into Montilla’s arrest conducted by an inspector general. While details have yet to be finalized, Folt said she is looking to see if she can have the investigations be done “more broadly” and applied to all USC student arrests.
Additionally, Folt contacted the Gould School of Law, which is developing online resources for arrested students.
“All these things take longer than probably they seem like they should, but we want to be able to be resources for people that are arrested,” Folt said. 
Additionally, Montilla is creating a Google form to consolidate protesters’ testimonies as well as a list of legal and mental health resources for support. With this newly established platform on Instagram, Montilla wants to help advocate for defunding the LAPD and supporting Black lives.
“Just to think about my experience as just a small taste of what’s going on is chilling, and I think that it’s really important to stay focused on the Black lives at stake,” Montilla said.

Corporate lawyer Beong-Soo Kim will serve as senior vice president and general counsel of USC starting July 1, President Carol Folt announced Tuesday. 
“Beong’s diverse and high-level legal expertise, mission-driven approach to taking on challenges and commitment to public service made him our clear first choice,” Folt told USC News. “He will be an important addition to the USC leadership team and an asset to our entire university community.”
As chief of the major frauds section in the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles for nearly 10 years, Kim directed investigations into health care fraud, securities and investor fraud, government fraud, theft of intellectual property and embezzlement, leading the nation’s largest federal white-collar prosecution section. 
“It is a privilege to join this remarkable institution, which touches the lives of so many people throughout Southern California and the world,” Kim said to USC News. “USC’s mission has never been more vital and relevant, and I am tremendously excited about working with President Folt and other stakeholders to move that mission forward.” 
After earning his master’s degree from the London School of Economics, Kim worked for the New York City mayor’s office and later on graduated from Harvard Law School in 1999. Following a clerkship at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, Kim returned to Harvard as a teaching fellow.
While Kim attended Harvard, his father’s ties to USC as an alumnus facilitated a connection to the University studying under the late Thornton School of Music professor and famed cellist Eleanore Schoenfeld during high school. Kim also taught at USC in 2007, designing and co-instructing a weekly seminar at the Gould School of Law.
Kim also served as a litigation associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson before moving on to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in L.A. and later serving as partner at Jones Day in L.A. Before his appointment as general counsel of USC, he worked as vice president and assistant general counsel at Kaiser Permanente.
Kim’s search committee comprised Gould School of Law dean Andrew Guzman, Board of Trustee member Oscar Munoz, Ostrow School of Dentistry dean Avishai Sadan, president of faculty of Academic Senate Rebecca Lonergan, Senior Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp.
Former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill general counsel and vice chancellor Mark Merritt served on the search committee and will continue in his role as an adviser to the University, according to Folt. Vice President and Managing General Counsel Stacy Bratcher, who managed the search committee, will now report to Kim.
The USC Office of the General Counsel addresses legal issues related to the University, Keck Medicine of USC and other USC-owned entities.

I want to make something abundantly clear: Black lives matter, unapologetically and unequivocally. 
The fact that this statement remains remotely controversial after the events of the past several weeks, years and centuries is confounding, but nevertheless, it does. 
For swaths of Americans — particularly the more resentful, privileged and light of skin among us — the statement elicits discomfort, collective groans and, in many instances, rage. 
The same could have been said for the NFL. Though the league never verbally excoriated its players, it was still rage that fueled the bulk of the league’s response when the issue reached its last peak in 2017. That’s when players across the league began kneeling during the national anthem and our schmuck-in-chief Donald Trump responded by demanding team owners “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now!”
Within a year, league owners acted and established a policy that all players and team personnel must “show respect for the flag and the anthem” or else risk being fined. The policy was never enforced, but the stance of America’s most popular professional sport was clear. 
That stance changed Friday. 
“We, the NFL, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during a video statement posted to the league’s official Twitter account. “We, the NFL, believe Black lives matter.” 
Goodell’s statement might be empty virtue signaling or a mere performative gesture. Still, it reveals a lot about where the United States is right now. 
For starters, Goodell’s admission of the league’s guilt and condemnation of racism means that Americans’ general attitudes toward race might finally be changing for the first time in a long time. 
If you have a social media account and aren’t a resentful right-winger, you know exactly what I’m talking about. 
I have never seen more white people publicly admitting their guilt and expressing disgust at racism and systematic oppression. I’m not just talking about Jacobin-reading lefties either — they’ve been on this train for a while — I’m talking about very, very white people, the type of white person I know voted for Trump, saying that what’s been done to the United States’ Black community is bullshit and we have to start holding racists accountable for it. 
This isn’t just a hunch; data tells the same story. In 2016, a Reuters poll found that 72% of Americans thought Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling during the national anthem was unpatriotic, and 61% said they didn’t support his protest. Now, new polling shows that a majority of Americans believe that racism and discrimination in the United States is a “big problem” and believe that protesters’ anger is justified. 
In light of these developments and Goodell’s apology, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: After years of feckless conduct, the president just might be in trouble. 
The last time we saw Trump and Goodell’s names in the same headline, the commissioner was metaphorically on his knees, kowtowing to team owners who were more interested in censuring and villainizing their players than supporting them. 
The fact that the commissioner felt safe enough to issue the statement that he did without even consulting team owners means that Trump’s position and the public standing of those who support him is more precarious than ever. 
Think of it this way: When Kaepernick took his kneel-heard-round-the-world in 2016, the ramifications on NFL viewership were so dramatic that the league issued an internal memo addressing the matter. League viewership declined 11% and a Rasmussen study found that nearly one-third of participants were “less likely to watch an NFL game” because of players’ protests. The next season, as players’ protests continued, viewership significantly declined again. 
With that experience in mind, Goodell is basically offering a polite fuck-you to any racist who might threaten to boycott the NFL again. He’s not afraid of the financial consequences this time around, and that’s probably because he doesn’t think he’ll face any this time around. He knows that, as the aforementioned data suggests, American society is less Trump-ish than it was four years ago, and his apology reflects that. 
At the end of the day, I can’t really assign any conclusive moral judgement to Goodell’s apology. Was it a step in the right direction? Yes. Whenever an American institution as prominent as the NFL makes a public about-face like this, it is significant. It forces the NFL’s less savory and more racist contingent to reckon with truths that they previously drowned out with Sunday Night Football and Fox News. 
Still, Goodell’s statement failed to even name Colin Kaepernick and did not address the fact that only four out of the NFL’s 32 head coaches are Black and only two of its 32 general managers are Black. 
These issues will persist unless Goodell follows up his apology with sustained, meaningful engagement and action. I’m talking about big donations, unrelenting public advocacy and continuous support for the league’s politically active players, coaches and personnel. 
In conclusion, I guess the takeaway is this. In recent days and weeks, two four-star generals have expressed withering disapproval of Trump. Hell, Mitt Romney — yes, Mitt Romney — marched with protesters in Washington D.C. and declared “Black lives matter.” Now, the head of the NFL, the embodiment of all things American and bald-eagle-related, has said the same, and I think it’s made several things very clear. 
In the minds of an increasing American majority, Black lives matter. That’s good news for the country and a disastrous development for Trump.

On the morning of Super Bowl LII, the city of Philadelphia took to the streets in anticipation of celebrating who would become the 2018 NFL champion Eagles. It wasn’t the typical procedure of putting up barricades or cleaning the streets for fans — city employees coated light poles with hydraulic fluid to prevent celebrators from climbing them. 
As predicted, the slippery substance proved necessary. After the underdog Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33, the city of Philadelphia flared up as fans flooded the streets in joy. However, byproducts of their enjoyment were destructive acts such as flipping cars, starting fires and vandalizing buildings. 
At the time, media outlets downplayed this destruction. On ABC’s “Good Morning America,” former NFL player and GMA co-host Michael Strahan simply called the fans “rowdy,” softening the extent of the damage they caused to the city. He, alongside the other hosts, were smiling throughout the broadcast, implying that the fans’ actions were acceptable. 
A New York Times piece shared a similar sentiment, using “rowdy” as well as “unruly” to describe the celebrations. News outlet Quartz described the fans’ actions as “all-destructive joy.”
But the violence and chaos that ensued in Philadelphia that night is similar to what is predominantly portrayed of current Black Lives Matter protests in mainstream media. According to USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism assistant professor of professional practice Miki Turner, media outlets have a habit of downplaying the result of chaotic championship celebrations.
“Basically, it was portrayed as a celebration that went awry as opposed to a riot, but in actuality, in the definition of a riot, it was a riot,” Turner said of the 2018 Philadelphia celebrations. “Property was destroyed, there was vandalism, there was looting.” 
The country has witnessed other similar violent and destructive acts occur in some of its major sports cities. But these riots don’t occur in support of diversity in sports, equal pay among male and female athletes or other social issues — instead, fans tear up their town to celebrate a win or mourn a loss.
But these sports riots extend from coast to coast, even in recent history. After the San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2014, fans smashed the windows of police cars and buses as part of a larger scene of vandalism and bonfires. By the end of the night, two people had been shot and one had been stabbed.  
In the past 20 years, Boston has seen riots whenever the Red Sox won the World Series, resulting in fires, flipped cars and fights with police. In 1984 after the Tigers brought home the World Series championship, Detroit faced similar riots as fans looted and burned police vehicles. After the Lakers won the NBA Finals in 2000, fans started fires and damaged police cars. 
During the 2020 protests against police brutality after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, much media coverage has focused on the destruction that ensues. For instance, an NBC News broadcast stated that the “nation erupted into scenes of chaos, violence and widespread destruction,” focusing on the dangers these protests pose to cities across the nation. 
Turner also noted how the circumstances of these riots could cause law enforcement to react differently to different crowds. The San Francisco Police Department reported only a “handful” of arrests after the city’s 2014 celebration. After the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series and chaos ensued, 14 arrests were made in Wrigleyville.
For comparison, 20 people were arrested in San Francisco last Tuesday for violating curfew, and in the last nine days, Chicago has seen more than 2,500 arrests related to civil unrest. 
Turner said that since the current protests are, by nature, in opposition to the police, the authority of police departments to properly handle crowd control is under question — which may only add to the tension.
“Even when it’s just a peaceful situation, the police are on guard,” Turner said of the current protests. “They’ve got their hands on their hips, their hands on their revolvers, because they’re expecting something to pop up.”
Turner, an award-winning photojournalist, also illustrated how the images depicted by the media in these riots differ. 
“Basically, they did a wide shot of the crowd just so you could see how many people were there and then close-ups on people who were just celebrating,” Turner said of the 2018 Philadelphia riots. “[Destruction was] not something that they focused on, and what you saw in Philadelphia is that you saw more context.”
Ali Pearl, a postdoctoral fellow at USC whose research deals with race and culture, discussed the importance of acknowledging the different reasons for violence with sports fans and Black Lives Matter protesters. This context, she said, is key in understanding why sports rioting and protesting against police brutality are two completely different stories despite occasional similar acts of violence.
“I actually understand the impulse toward property destruction when you are protesting police brutality, when you’re protesting injustice, because you’re targeting the material products of a system that maintained inequality,” Pearl said. “When you are just celebrating or lamenting a sports win or loss, I don’t actually understand the impulse toward property destruction in that moment. There’s not a target to that impulse, it’s more of a release of energy.”
Daniel Durbin, a communication professor at USC, echoed that sentiment, adding that there’s not a “larger social picture” behind sports fans’ violent actions.
“Even if you don’t choose to take it up, there’s a moral call to protest or to support [Black Lives Matter] protesters that goes across social and political lines,” Durbin said. “There’s no social or moral imperative to your team winning the Super Bowl or the NBA championship.”
In an academic journal titled Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, researchers analyzed the rhetoric used by mainstream news outlets when covering the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Mo. The journal predominantly found language referring to the lawless nature of the protests, as well as inflammatory quotes from police and an emphasis on the violence that ensued.
The article suggested newsroom diversity could help facilitate unbiased language when covering protests. Sociology and gender studies professor Michael Messner said it comes down to not only increasing newsroom diversity but being receptive as reporters to learning about and covering different communities.
“It’s partly a matter of broadening the attitudes of everybody who’s out there working, doing news,” Messner said. “But I think it’s also important to recognize that we do need to continue to move toward more diversity in the newsroom.”

As a nation, we are at a pivotal moment in history. George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, along with other recent killings of Black individuals — Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade and many, many more — have sparked nationwide and global outrage over a longstanding pattern of brutality against Black people, particularly at the hands of the police. More than 700 protests and counting have erupted across the country in recent weeks, and the rallying cry for justice and change continues to echo across social media. 
During this time, many are asking how they can best be involved. And while there are many paths to allyship, such as joining in the protests, spreading resources, educating oneself, donating and signing petitions, one contribution method that should not be overlooked is supporting Black businesses and creatives. The present economy does not favor Black-owned businesses, as they continuously experience underinvestment, even when the economy is flourishing. Therefore, collectively dedicating spending power to support these individuals and groups can be incredibly impactful. While there are far too many to list, here are 15 businesses and creatives in Los Angeles you can assist through your time, money and dedication.

Cross Colours

The world is on fire, the revolution has begun and history has taken a sharp turn. On May 25, George Floyd was killed in cold blood by a Minneapolis police officer while three more aided and watched, prompting nationwide outrage and protests in all 50 states. As a result, the Black Lives Matter movement is far more visible than it has ever been before; not only is it the driving force behind recent policy change within cities across various states — such as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s recent decision to reduce LAPD funding — but it is also forcing white people to have uncomfortable conversations and face truths they otherwise may never have confronted about racism. It is this shift toward accountability that hits closest to home.
I am a white, privileged female who draws extensively from Black culture every single day of my life — from the music I listen to and the clothes I wear to the slang I use and the people I identify with. I am far from alone in that reality; in fact, many of you reading this probably meet the same criteria. Over the past week, I’ve had many long-winded, awkward conversations on the subject of cultural appropriation and its significance with my white peers — some of them disappointed me, while others outright sickened me. After reflecting on these conversations, I decided that I want to use this platform to send a very clear message to my white readers, colleagues and friends.
Like systemic racism, appropriation of Black culture is so ubiquitous and normalized that most white people can actively engage in it and never, not once in the course of their lives, be forced to confront that fact — not that that’s anything new. The infatuation with Black culture by white people has historical roots; look no further than the whitewashing of the rock ‘n’ roll genre and hip-hop culture, along with other cultural thefts, for evidence. The enduring influence of Black culture in America as well as white people’s enduring exploitation of it is not a matter of opinion — it is fact.
In 2020, white girls in Jordans populate Instagram’s “Explore” page; rap is the No. 1 genre; public figures like the Kardashians and Billie Eilish, among many, many others, successfully exploit Black trends and behaviors (everything from cornrows to use of a “blaccent”) that their very pioneers have been persecuted for embracing. Why? Because the business model is such that Black culture sells when white people hijack it. 
That being said, I’m not here to “whitesplain” cultural appropriation. The point I’m trying to make is that, in the wake of this nationwide call to action, white people are under scrutiny in a way we have never been before — and that has the potential to be a great thing. Right now, the way you choose to approach this issue as a white person (the conversations you do or don’t have, the sacrifices you are willing or unwilling to make) are extremely consequential. With that in mind, I have a few thoughts I want to share.
Popular culture in America today — yes, virtually all of it — is directly rooted in Black culture. Our white privilege cushions us, enabling us to reap its benefits while ignoring its dire realities. To listen to Black artists, wear clothing inspired by Black culture, use slang coined by the Black community, capitalize on traditionally Black beauty trends, to consciously draw on fragments of Black culture for your personal benefit but then stay silent when Black people are being killed is objectively and patently harmful. Your silence is complicity in injustice, in oppression and an ugly confirmation that if given the choice to retain your privilege at the cost of Black lives, you would. 
The most disturbing part of it all is this: I know that white people taking accountability for appropriation tarnishes their “enjoyment” of the very culture they’re exploiting and for that reason, addressing those realities isn’t “fun.” Aside from the obvious fact that curbing systemic racism was never meant to be “fun,” what a small sacrifice to make — what a tiny, insignificant price to pay — to have a part in bringing those oppressed justice. Any who evaluate that tradeoff and choose silence play an active role in the persistence of racism in America.
In that same vein, playing dumb and asking questions like, “So I’m not allowed to wear Jordans or I’m racist?” or making condescending comments such as, “Just because I appreciate Black culture but didn’t post anything doesn’t make me racist” is effectively racial gaslighting. By making those remarks, you are indicating that you understand the dynamic relationship between the variables at hand — Black culture, your exploitation of it and your white privilege — and have chosen to dismiss and trivialize it rather than see it for what you know it to be. You’re not fooling anyone. 
Newsflash: Recognizing your privilege and doing something about it is not meant to be comfortable. In fact, the goal is for you to feel encumbered and burdened, for you to acknowledge your implicit biases and the role you’ve played (whether you realize it or not) in perpetuating racist societal structures and to then actively try to mitigate that effect. This shit is meant to make you think and squirm in your seat. In order for real change to happen, white people must feel uncomfortable. Perhaps that one meager moment of discomfort can lend some insight into how Black people in American feel on a daily basis and have felt for the past four centuries.  
The revolution is happening; we are scorching the earth. Put your delicate feelings aside, and join the fight — we are duty-bound to address our nation’s past sins and continuing injustices and we should never forget it.

Joining the ranks of HBO’s steadily growing slate of socially current television series is Michaela Coel’s “I May Destroy You.” The series premiered Sunday with the first of 12 episodes titled “Eyes Eyes Eyes.” The show centers around Coelas Arabella, a confident twenty-something Londoner with a promising writing career. Her life is seemingly perfect with great friends and burgeoning success until she is drugged and must piece together memories from the night it happened. 
The first episode introduces viewers to Arabella and her eclectic group of friends. When we first meet Arabella, she’s returning from an unproductive stint in Italy that her editors funded, hoping she’d finish a draft of her follow-up to her debut successful novel. In an office in her hometown of London, she struggles to crank out the draft she failed to complete in Italy. Arabella’s Google search of “How to write quickly?” is something any college student scrambling to meet a deadline can relate to. 
Arabella admits temporary defeat after her friend Kwame (Paapa Essiedu), who was keeping her company, ditches her for a last minute date. Arabella sets a timer for an hour in an effort to limit her procrastination and sets out to the bar to meet her other friend, Simon (Aml Ameen) who she’d initially turned down to work on her writing. This is where the mystery of the series begins. 
After a few drinks, what was meant to be a harmless hour of fun with her friends quickly goes awry. The continuity of the episode begins to fragment, audio and visuals are asynchronous and scene cuts are disjointed and abrupt as Arabella stumbles out of the bar and leaves the audience scratching their heads. 
Outside of the engrossing nature of the mystery of the series, Arabella’s addictive dynamics with everyone around her draw the viewer in. From her romantic relationships to encounters with fans of her popular first work “Chronicles of a Fed-Up Millennial,” you find yourself wanting to know more. 
Her relationship with her long-distance Italian boyfriend — who she visits under the guise of writing so her editors pay for the trip — is among the most compelling. The boyfriend, Biagio (Marouane Zotti), is archetypically ‘foreign’ and mysterious. He feigns disinterest as they separate at the beginning, rebuffing her wishes to label their relationship. But as her Uber takes her to the airport, Biagio calls her and says, “Don’t forget the sea, she’s gonna be asking for when you come again,” effectively winning the heart of any viewer previously unimpressed by his aloof attitude. 
“I May Destroy You” is also intriguing in its lack of reference to the diversity of the show. The cast is predominantly Black and also features LGBTQ characters. Some may find it detrimental not to address the representation of the show, while others may find it welcome. It is refreshing to watch a show where a Black protagonist’s primary personality trait is not being Black, and a gay character’s defining characteristic is not being gay. 
“I May Destroy You” seems as though it will approach difficult topics in a manner similar to the graphic and unwavering methods of its network mate, “Euphoria.” At the end of the first episode, as Arabella completes her draft without realizing it, it becomes increasingly clear that she had been drugged at some point the night before, hence the dissonant audio and visuals and abrupt cuts and jumps. (Her editors kindly describe the latter part of the draft she completed in her drugged stupor after somehow making her way back from the bar as “abstract.”) 
The episode concludes with Arabella opening the door to her room and the bang of her doorknob against the wall prompting the recollection of her being sexually assaulted which she only addresses with a “Hmm.” It leaves the audience confused, concerned and curious about the previous night’s events. Then, the screen turns to black and you’re left scrambling for another episode that won’t be released for another week. 
The only pitfall with the episode was a seemingly random background storyline documenting Simon’s failing relationship and his partner’s unsuccessful attempt to spice it up. The storyline, in this individual episode, ends with Simon being a predictably disappointing boyfriend who cheats on his partner. While the storyline may round out as the season progresses, in this episode, it felt like an unnecessary addition that took the focus away from Arabella. Instead, more scenes about Arabella’s time in Italy with Biagio could have  presented a compelling inclusion.  
In spite of this less intriguing storyline, the majority of the episode successfully drew me in and made me yearn to know about Arabella, her friendships and her personality. The cut on her forehead and the unintelligible conclusion to her draft are pieces of the puzzle that the audience and Arabella alike will try to piece together as the series progresses. Coel simultaneously provides the audience with too little, too much and just enough information to not ask but demand the viewer’s attention.

With the recent outrage caused by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd (among countless others), there has been a palpable shift in the United States: These deaths served as the final straw, igniting a revolution against the police brutality and systemic racism that reflects the country’s very foundations. According to USA Today, there are at least 700 cities actively protesting and these demonstrations have flooded the streets in all 50 states.
The Black Lives Matter movement has taken on new mediums, combining in-person activism with social media. The Black community has also called out to all non-Black people to step up as allies during this time — one-liners such as “White silence is violence” have decorated protesters’ posters en masse.
The Black community needs allies committed to the fight for justice; however, as an ally, there is a line to toe between effective and performative allyship … yes, there is such a thing as being a “bad” or “harmful” ally. 
“[Denver School Board Director] Tay Anderson made a good point that has stuck with me: A lot of the violence and vandalism we’ve seen is being done by non-Black people,” Black Colorado activist Jayah Caley said. “It’s counterproductive to our movement.” 
Navigating the Black Lives Matter movement while being non-Black may be difficult, but one of the best ways to prevent unintentional harm is by educating oneself. From reading “How to Be an Antiracist” by Ibram Kendi and watching “13th” on Netflix to actively engaging in difficult conversations about race, there are limitless resources one can use to expand one’s knowledge on systematic oppression and racism. 
“Keep educating yourself, keep asking questions and be willing to listen when you are being corrected,” Caley said. “Take what you’ve learned and share it.”
Caley is correct that one of the most important and beneficial things an ally can do is to listen when they are being corrected. Many non-Black activists are well versed in the workings of the Black Lives Matter movement and the nuances of white allyship — but despite this knowledge and their good intentions, allies must be prepared to accept accountability when they make mistakes. It is equally important that allies do not attempt to educate Black community members about their own oppression — this is the equivalent of a student trying to tell the professor how to teach their class.  
When it comes to virtual activism, social media is being used as a platform for sharing resources, signing petitions, locating donation sites and inciting intellectual discourse. To that end, Black activists have set the example of what one should and should not share as a digital ally. Many Black activists have asked community members to stop sharing the traumatizing videos of the killings of Black people. Instead, allies ought to use their platform to inform their followers on petitions and organizations they can donate to.
Media silence has been seen as one of the most harmful behaviors an ally can engage in. Particularly as a white ally, it is one’s responsibility to leverage one’s privilege to play a role in bringing justice to those who are oppressed. Whether that comes in the form of sharing the link to bail funds or the directions to a Black Lives Matter event, sharing something — anything — is better than sharing nothing, and many Black community members have made it perfectly clear that the message media silence from a white person sends is complicity. 
It is also important to discuss how to be a good ally while protesting and attending Black Lives Matter events. During these events, non-Black attendees should remember that they are guests, not hosts.
Many non-Black allies have made the mistake of making the event about them by leading the marches or chants and by trying to tell Black community members how to organize. The purpose of an ally is to uplift the Black community and to form human barriers between Black protesters and the police — the presence of allies is certainly important, but they should behave accordingly.
There have been “allies” that have taken advantage of the protests, whether by looting for the sake of destruction or attempting to take charge in a tone-deaf demonstration of performative allyship. These digressions can be actively harmful to the goal of the protests — for instance, the looting that occurred during many protests managed to shift the narrative away from Black Lives Matter to the protesters engaged in property destruction.
Given that the United States is undergoing a major cultural shift in which the Black community is at the forefront, it is the duty of allies to engage in verbal and physical action to elevate the voices of this community to the best of their abilities.
Allies ought to use this time to educate themselves, to use their platforms for digital activism with the goal of inciting change and to use their privileged non-Black bodies to protect Black people at protests. They ought not to stay silent, take control or strip the microphone from the Black community. Allies must be cognizant of their role and continue to fight alongside the Black community for justice.

“Sometimes, you need to scorch everything to the ground, and start over. After the burning the soil is richer, and new things can grow.”
In her 2017 novel “Little Fires Everywhere,” Celeste Ng chronicles the intertwining of two families in a “progressive” suburban neighborhood during the ’90s. Recently adapted into a television show starring Reese Witherspoon as Elena Richardson and Kerry Washington as Mia Warren, the franchise tackles themes of adolescence, motherhood and race — and of course, fire. 
Both the racial tensions between white landlord Elena and Black single mother Mia and her daughter Pearl and the show’s symbolic use of fire parallel the contemporary racial climate. 
On May 25, a viral video surfaced of a police officer killing 46-year-old George Floyd in Minneapolis. The officer is seen digging his knee into the neck of Floyd, as Floyd begs, “I can’t breathe. Please, the knee on my neck.” Floyd died shortly after. 
While the coronavirus has only posed a threat since late 2019, the United States has been plagued by racial profiling and police brutality for much longer. This phenomenon cannot be traced to one specific point in time; rather, it reflects the foundations of American society — the same ones that implemented structural racism through slavery and the same ones that provoke us to differentiate between racism and anti-racism. 
According to Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre, “Anti-racism is the active process of identifying and eliminating racism by changing systems, organizational structures, policies and practices and attitudes, so that power is redistributed and shared equitably.” This is distinct from being “not racist,” which translates to being ignorant of the differences between racial groups. Being “not racist” is complicit in white supremacy and is actually racist. 
To contextualize this difference, Elena and her children epitomize the “woke” white person who insists they understand racism but whose perspective merely scrapes the surface: They perceive racism as the mere unfortunate fact that not all races are treated equally — a form of complacency that disregards the complex and nuanced experiences of marginalized communities.  
This lack of robust understanding manifests in the form of comments like, “I don’t see race because everybody should be treated the same.” This white, “progressive” family’s perception of racism starkly contrasts the reality of the United States’ racial environment, highlighted by Warren as its proxy, from her disapproval of the Richardson children’s lavish and privileged lifestyles to her discomfort and nervousness regarding the police. 
In one scene, Pearl and Moody (Elena’s son) are caught trespassing in a junkyard, and a neighborhood watch officer takes them home. Mia chastises Pearl, remarking how she could have died. Elena, overhearing their conversation, chimes in with, “I think you’re overreacting.” 
These interactions are laced with microaggressions and encapsulate the modern binary between racism and anti-racism. Racism does not exclusively pertain to overt acts such as saying the n-word or participating in a white supremacy protest; it also includes covert and subtle forms of prejudice, from microaggressions and supporting the police force in the United States to not using one’s privilege and platform to speak out on social injustices such as the killing of George Floyd. 
If one still denies that police violence is a “person problem” and not a race problem, I want to draw attention to another incident between a white woman and Black man, which occurred May 25 in Central Park. When Amy Cooper had her dog unleashed, against park policy, birdwatcher Chris Cooper (no relation) asked her to leash it. Chris Cooper then started filming the verbal dispute, where Amy Cooper claimed he was threatening her and called 911. “An African American man is threatening me,” she told them.  
While making that phone call, Amy Cooper was fully aware of the implications of calling the police on a Black man. She endangered his life by feeding into the structural racism that killed George Floyd. Her actions reinforce the fact that police brutality is a systemic, embedded issue — and, even more disturbingly, that white people know this and are willing to exploit it for their benefit. 
The paradigm of these killings reveals that justice must be approached systemically or no comprehensive change will ensue. All four officers present at the scene were fired and are now facing charges in George Floyd’s killing, yet this occurred following a viral video and national outrage. Peaceful protests demanding justice were met with tear gas, yet the white supremacists equipped with assault weapons at the Michigan State Capitol were met with silence. Colin Kaepernick sparked controversy by kneeling to peacefully protest systemic oppression, yet George Floyd was killed by the knee of a police officer. 
We must elect officials who will advocate against institutionalized racism and work to reorganize historically discriminatory policies. We must instigate constructive conversations that function to educate each other and thwart overt and covert forms of white supremacy alike. We must act so that we do not need to demand justice for victims like George Floyd ever again. 
Like Ng writes, “Sometimes we need to scorch everything to the ground, and start over.” As we work to subvert oppressive systems of power and ingrained racism, a form of this proposal seems apt.

“Violence is never the answer” is just not the answer anymore. The opinion that violent or disruptive protests are an inappropriate vehicle to incite overdue social change is not the harmless middle ground perspective that people seem to think it is. 
This notion is more relevant than ever in light of the recent Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the disturbing killing of George Floyd, yet another Black victim of police brutality, by Derek Chauvin of the Minneapolis Police Department. These protests strive for anti-racist reform on U.S. law enforcement. 
Based on the historical and sociological contexts that characterize the U.S. cultural landscape, to say that violence and disruption are unwarranted in the fight for the equal protection of Black people in the United States is to effectively will that nothing changes for the Black community. 
In the discussion surrounding the fight for racial justice, the general U.S. public is quick to refer to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as an example of a very successful and, most notably, peaceful activist for Black rights. Even former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee deferred to King in an interview with CNN, criticizing the current Black Lives Matter movement in favor of the civil rights movement, claiming that “[King would] be appalled by the notion that we’re elevating some lives above others” and soon after claiming that the real solution to these kinds of issues is “loving people and treating people with dignity and respect.”
The attempt to discredit Black Lives Matter in the name of pacifism, pointing to more peaceful and successful Black rights movements, would be stronger if there ever actually was such a thing. King’s protests were far from nonviolent. From the Children’s Crusade, in which Black youth shockingly assembled to confront the police violence at their protests, to his own words, “Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed,” King promoted and enacted civil disruption to achieve his ends. In any useful efforts to dismantle the racism entangled in the United States’ very roots, civil disruption and precursors of violence have been a prerequisite. 
Now is no different. To withhold support for disruptive protests is to establish a roadblock on the only historically viable path to justice for Black Americans in this country. 
On a more principled level, one could argue that, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, the medium is the message. There is an inherent link between the character of a message and its vehicle. At this point, criticism of the disruptive nature of the demonstrations is almost inextricably tied to criticism of the plight itself. 
If the systematic oppression of Black people in the United States were not so bad and so persistent and did not cut horizontally across all vertical avenues for peaceful activism, there would be no need for violence and disruption. If a Black person in the United States were not three times more likely to be killed by the police than a white person, despite the disparity in population size favoring white people, then maybe the protesters could afford to ease up a little. If peaceful attempts at protesting police brutality, such as taking a knee during the national anthem on live television, did not get quickly dismissed, classified as unpatriotic and eventually publicly condemned, then maybe the protesters could afford to ease up a little.
If the average American knew enough about the civil rights movement to know that it was not the peaceful perfect wonderland in which existing power structures simply handed over rights to Black people with an “all you had to do was ask” smile and a sudden hankering for justice, then maybe the protesters could afford to ease up a little. 
But they simply cannot afford to ease up, even a little. Black people are and have been dying as a result of police brutality in the United States. The world can stand a few well-insured Targets being destroyed if it means that the systematic targeting and killing of human beings would be lessened. Some might call this radical, but to take it a step further, this country could stand a few uninsured Targets being destroyed if it serviced such a consequential end. This is not to trivialize any violence and disruption that obviously affects innocent bystanders, but painful processes of death and rebirth have always denoted meaningful transformation, including valuable social change. 
In this unfortunate wager, it is important to plant one’s flag firmly in the camp that uses violence to segue into the dawn of a more peaceful era over the status quo, in which senseless violence toward the Black community persists to no end. The piping-hot take that the Black Lives Matter cause is valid but its current disruptive means are not is devoid of actual meaning. Its means are a result of its cause, and to dismiss one is to dismiss them both.

On May 31, President Carol Folt penned a note to the USC community regarding the recent police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as the lynching of Ahmaud Arbery. I don’t know what I expected when I got her Universitywide email, but approximately 400 words later I had learned nothing about how the administration would support Black Trojans. The note was officially addressed to the “Trojan Community,” but given the content of the note, it’s clear that it was written with a sympathetic non-Black audience in mind. And why shouldn’t it? Only 5% of undergraduates, 3% of faculty and 8% of graduate students identify as Black. USC continues to fall short in terms of representation. 
Folt declared that she does not have “the answers” but that “we will seek them together.” It’s a nice message, but it’s one that ignores and erases the actionable demands Black community members have consistently brought to the administration well before the recent protests. This is not a departure from the University’s past rhetoric on the abstract ideal of “change.” As long as I’ve been at USC, the administration has professed a persistent, albeit vague, need and desire to change. We currently have both a President’s Culture Commission and a Working Group on University Culture.
This amounts to the gaslighting of Black Trojans. We are constantly assured that the administration understands our unique struggles, but the University is nowhere to be found when the time to directly support Black Trojans comes. In her note, Folt acknowledges that “this moment is our call to action.” She then calls for continued discussions among the USC community regarding policing, so as to encourage thoughtful debate. There is nothing to debate. Black Trojans are exhausted and demand action.
Ten concrete commitments President Folt can make to support Black Trojans:
1. Commit to admitting more Black students.
2. Commit to spending more resources on outreach to Black high schoolers and Black undergraduates considering graduate studies.
3. Commit to hiring more Black professors and putting more Black professors on tenure-track.
4. Commit to renaming the Von KleinSmid Center. Any name that doesn’t honor a racist. Bonus points if you name it after a Black person.
5. Commit to expanding the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. In terms of resources and physical space.
6. Commit to adding students and community leaders to the USC Board of Trustees. We are sick of a Board made up overwhelmingly of white multi-millionaires, and billionaires, who vote time and again to raise our tuition. If USC is moving into the future, the Board must as well.
7. Commit to divesting from the Los Angeles Police Department.
8. Commit to ensuring non-Black students, staff and faculty undergo racial bias training.
9. Commit to paying all USC employees a living wage and ensuring contractors are being paid a living wage.
10. Commit to listening to Black students, staff, faculty and community members. 
This moment is a call to action. President Folt, I implore you to act.

In the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, almost every organization has released statements of solidarity with the Black community. Some statements express explicit support for Black Lives Matter, while some take on a more palatable stance of standing for equality. 
The resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement prompts us to critically examine our own communities for racial injustice and disproportionate representation. In this vein, sororities and fraternities at USC are among the campus organizations that have released statements. While this may seem like the correct response given the circumstances, words can only do so much. Their statements against racial injustice feel empty and insincere considering the irony that these organizations, specifically Panhellenic and IFC, exist within a glaringly racist institution: Greek life.
Being labeled racist makes people and groups uncomfortable, but in unpacking that discomfort, we must question why it is more offensive for Greek life to be called a racist institution than it is for it to actually be a racist institution. Until the late 20th century, most fraternities and sororities did not accept nonwhite members, which is why Black college students had to create their own Greek organizations. Although fraternities and sororities are not officially segregated anymore, these organizations still employ “legacy” preference in their recruitment, which is an outdated way of keeping the same families — and as a result, the same race — of white people in their rosters. 
Moreover, it is no secret that there is an unofficial but understood hierarchy to these campus organizations. As you go up the “ranks,” the membership is evidently whiter. The explicit and alarming message behind this is that whiteness is what is considered valuable. There are, of course, some people of color in Greek organizations; yet, particularly in organizations that are “higher ranked,” these individuals are often tokenized and serve as examples for the organizations to turn to in an effort to dispel claims of racism. These members typically adhere to the same standards of beauty, stem from the same high-income bracket and wear the same brands of clothes, all while enabling the organizations to give off the facade of diversity. 
Members of Greek life may want to defend their recruitment process for being unbiased, and I would implore them to provide data comparing the demographics of Greek members to the demographics of the student body or even to the demographics of those who undergo the recruitment process. Currently, such data do not exist, but it’s clear to any student that Greek rosters do not reflect the demographics of USC’s student body. Additionally, there is no transparency in the Greek recruitment process. The organizations provide vague statements about potential new members having the right “vibe” or “fit” for their organizations. Yet when the organizations are homogenous to begin with, they are likely to only “vibe” with people similar to them.
Not only are Greek organizations racist, but they are also elitist. Joining Greek life is a form of self-segregation hidden within a thinly veiled ruse of philanthropy. The earliest fraternities were secret societies for the wealthy. Today, the only difference is that they are not secret anymore. In their defense, some may point out that they raise and donate money to their respective philanthropies, but fraternities and sororities still hoard much more wealth than necessary. No other student organization has dues even close to those of Greek organizations, which charge fees far higher than what an average student’s budget allows for. The new-member fees for a sorority at USC, from a document USC Panhellenic released in 2019, ranged from $1,954 to $3,217 for the semester. This is an unnecessarily high cost to join a “philanthropic” organization — perhaps, because it’s less about philanthropy and more about the mansions they inhabit.
Furthermore, these institutions provide professional networks for members that give them lifelong advantages, despite the fact that membership in a Greek organization has no relevance to professional capabilities. This network parallels the Trojan Family network that USC prides itself on, which is likely a reason why fraternities and sororities have been able to thrive within the University for so long. However, when the organizations are made up of the wealthiest and mostly white students, this practice of cronyism only perpetuates race and class division by helping the same group of people maintain their status and denying the possibility of socioeconomic mobility. 
Beyond being harmful to the USC student community, Greek organizations also contribute to the unnecessarily large police presence in the area around USC. Only 22% of USC students are in Greek organizations, yet the Row, lined with its mansions, requires constant patrolling. Beyond gentrifying South Central, USC is also putting its surrounding community at risk by enabling the existence of organizations that increase police presence. As we have all come to know, Black Americans are much more likely to be stopped by police and are twice as likely as white Americans to be killed by police. Latinx Americans are also killed by police at disproportionate rates. An increased police presence caused by the weekly parties hosted by USC’s fraternities only puts people of color at and around USC and South Central at greater risk.
If USC were to put an end to Greek life, it could turn the houses that host these parties on the Row into more student housing. Currently, USC provides a mere two-year housing guarantee to its students. Students are left alone to find housing in the middle of their second year, often forced to deal with corrupt landlords. By turning the current Greek-owned houses into housing available to all students, USC would not only be able to provide more of its students with housing but also put an end to the weekly parties that require increased policing. If USC is really committed to being an equitable institution, then it should take this step in that direction.
President Carol Folt sent out an email to the USC community at the end of last month in which she wrote, “It will be challenging to confront directly issues like racism in our community, but we must.” If this is truly the case, then let us start with our Greek organizations. They create a divide among students and put the greater South Central community at risk. Moreover, if USC wants to rid itself of its “spoiled children” image, especially after its admissions scandal, it cannot associate itself with these elitist organizations. 
Until Greek life is banned at USC, the University is actively endorsing classism and racism. Racism is a violent act, one evidently integral to Greek life. The current moment that we find ourselves in necessitates action that is definitively anti-racist. In engaging in the lengthy, difficult and crucial work of eradicating racism in our communities, it becomes increasingly clear that we must end Greek life.
