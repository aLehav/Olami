On November 9, 2016, I woke up to a house full of somber roommates. I then went to my classes, full of somber classmates and somber professors. Some students missed class, and a few of my professors provided class time to discuss how we were feeling. 
Given the exceptional nature of this year’s political climate, and USC’s responsibility to provide students with the resources they need to succeed, the University’s decision to direct students to events and programs which could help alleviate stress surrounding the inauguration is justified, if not necessary. 
For many students and faculty, these feelings returned during inauguration week, and USC attempted to mitigate them by directing students to programs such as diversity rallies and Mindful USC. On the Wednesday before the inauguration, a group of USC faculty held the Rally for Inclusion and Tolerance. A description of the rally was posted on the official USC Dornsife Events Calendar, which stated  that “a group of USC faculty will hold a rally demonstrating faculty solidarity with students and staff who are feeling vulnerable in the current political climate.” On Inauguration Day, USC students received an email from Provost Michael Quick reminding them of Mindful USC, a program which focuses on stress reduction and being fully present. 
While the timing of Provost Quick’s email and the inclusion of the rally as a campus event make it appear as if like the University is taking a side politically, USC is simply fulfilling its duty to inform students of resources that could be useful to them. 
In a typical election year, holding a rally that seems to assume that students and faculty feel vulnerable due to the election of a certain president would be absurd. If students simply were disappointed that their candidate didn’t win, it would be inappropriate for the University to hold an event that seemed to support this group of students in particular. 
However, this is not a typical election year. Students aren’t just disappointed that their candidate didn’t win; many are fearful and feeling threatened. 
Following the election, over 40 percent of Americans described one of their reactions to Trump’s victory as “afraid.” Of those who voted for Hillary Clinton, this percentage was much higher — 76 percent. And odds are that the majority of USC students fell into this category, since a plurality of young voters chose Clinton. Of course, most USC students wouldn’t need to see the statistics to recognize that the mood of the majority of their classmates after the election — and immediately preceding the inauguration — was generally negative. Ignoring the feelings of these students would be a disservice to the University because they inevitably could impact their performance in the classroom. 
USC is a diverse campus, and it is in the best interest of the individual students and the faculty and the University as a whole for everyone to feel their best. If a large group of students feel upset, then the University has every right to take steps to help students feel more comfortable in order to improve their learning abilities. In terms of the rally, this meant providing a gathering space for students to discuss their feelings in a comfortable environment. 
Similarly, Mindful USC has several programs which are meant to help students manage stress or anxiety to thrive in their learning environment. While the timing of the email definitely suggested that the USC administration was assuming students would need this service around Inauguration Day, this was a way for the University to be proactive in addressing potential issues on campus. 
On a day when many students may be needing the exact services of Mindful USC and other programs, why not send a reminder? Maybe a student feeling particularly down on Inauguration Day who had never heard of Mindful USC decided to sign up after that email and used it as a way to lower post-election stress. Even one student getting valuable services should be enough to look past any potential political connotation of these University reminders. 
USC should put student and faculty needs ahead of fear of a political rebuttal. When a large portion of students feel fearful or stressed, the University should take steps to address the issue. This isn’t crossing the line of political advocacy. It is being proactive in alleviating student stress, which in turn will improve students’ learning environment. If the University had allowed fears of appearing to choose a side politically to stop it from informing students of these programs, it would have deprived students of valuable resources exactly when they needed them.

Lunderful asks my question in a different way. I ask who are these marginalized students? And who is marginalizing them?
Please give me a detailed description of a “marginalized student” at one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  Thanks in advance for thinking deeply.

USC might be picking sides during this contentious time in America. Last week, a description of the Rally for Inclusion and Tolerance was included on the USC Dornsife College Calendar of Events website, where listings for events on campus are published for student and faculty reference. At the rally, two students in attendance hoisted a banner that read “Trojans vs. Trump.” On Inauguration Day, USC distributed an email memorandum reminding students of an initiative aimed at promoting student mental and physical health. The initiative, “Mindful USC,” has been an asset for students over the past two years, and a similar email notification was sent last January. However, in addition to being from the traditional co-chairs of “Mindful USC,” Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni and Professor Allen Weiss, this year’s email was provided by Provost Michael Quick. The inclusion of the University’s highest academic administrator and the substantially longer memorandum suggests that there was an impetus separate from the desire to simply provide a regular notice about a years-old program. 
It is no secret that there are plenty of “Trojans vs. Trump.” Undocumented Trojans, the LGBT community and several other groups of students have valid apprehension in the wake of President Donald Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric and policy goals. It is also likely that there are many people in USC’s administration that share the fears and concerns of students, and from his communications with the USC community since the election, Quick seems to be chief among them. 
However, the University as an organization should not appear to reject one political stance in favor of another. Organizations on campus should be free to bring whomever they want to speak on any issue, but the University should exercise discretion when choosing whether or not to publicize an event or speaker under the USC banner.
It is one thing for student groups to be allowed to peacefully protest on USC’s campus, to form political advocacy groups, offer peer counseling to each other or — if the situation is serious enough — suggest referral to University-sponsored mental health initiatives. It is quite another for the University itself to seemingly endorse and publicize a rally against the President of the United States or to infer that the entire student body needed to be reminded about a mental health initiative on the day the new president was sworn in. The Rally for Inclusion was marketed at the whole student body, and the memorandum was sent to the whole student body — but neither clearly represented the beliefs and needs of the whole student body. In fact, the recognition of the rally against Trump and the timing of the memorandum may have the combined effect of making conservative students who voted for Trump feel a little less welcomed at USC.
The University should act as a facilitator of dialogue and learning, not political advocacy. Regardless of if members of the Trojan community believe that casting a particular vote was the right thing to do, official University action that infers such a belief that is held on a campus-wide scale will overstep the bounds of institutional propriety and can only harm students who likely already fear ostracization.
Individuals should not be subject to restrictions on political expression on campus. There is no doubt that students should engage in political advocacy and do their best to make their voices heard in houses of government the whole world over. Without political pressure and engagement from young adults, the needs of millennials will simply not be represented. Yet, it is emphatically the duty of the University to teach students what they need to know in order to succeed in their chosen fields, not to separately ordain which political opinions are in need of support or rejection. 
Many groups on campus already exist to pursue political ends. In the interest of a balanced education and welcoming campus environment, the University administration should not be among them.

Mac Walsh carries a guitar pick with him wherever he goes. 
Strummin’ away · Sophomore Mac Walsh (above) is a music industry major, but unlike his peers, he makes it a goal to write two songs a day. Walsh published an album in 2015 and released 5 track EP in 2016. Trevor Sochocki | Daily Trojan
He still remembers the one thing that changed his life — a John Mayer concert film that his parents gave to him as an Easter gift. Strumming his guitar, he looks down with a slight, but earnest smile, as if he were holding a newborn baby. He’s a simple guy, and it’s quite clear upon first impression — Mac Walsh lives and breathes music.
Walsh, a sophomore majoring in music industry and English, is one of the many talented student artists who arrived at USC in pursuit of successful music career. But beyond his passion for music, one thing sets him apart from his peers — his uncanny ability to put his heart and emotions into music. 
“It used to be all about the guitar, but songwriting has really grown on me,” he said.
The summer before his senior year of high school, the Kansas City native began to dabble in songwriting. He wrote his first song, “Monster,” as part of his audition for GRAMMY Camp, a five-day music industry camp for young artists. Walsh became one of the few students accepted into this highly selective program. 
“The first song I ever wrote was terrible,” Walsh said, blushing as he recalled his first time writing music. “It was bluesy… but the lyrics were absolutely awful.” 
Despite his reluctance to admit so, that first song became a catalyst for his growth as a musician. And since then, there has been no going back for Walsh. 
Citing some of his inspirations as Bob Dylan, Ed Sheeran and Bon Iver, Walsh involves himself in the musical process everyday. 
However, there is one particular artist that he hopes to emulate one day: John Mayer. Drawing inspiration from both his influences and favorite album Continuum, the singer-songwriter aims to reflect his idols not only in musical style, but also in his creative process.
“When I’m writing new songs, I take little bits and pieces from songs I really like at the time,” Walsh said. “I’m a guitar player first and foremost — I’m not that great of a singer, so I normally write the music out first and lyrics take me a while.”
With a budding career ahead of him, Walsh attributes his greatest learning experiences in the past three years to his friends, family and USC. Since arriving at the University, the singer-songwriter has worked on a variety of projects, including several EPs and a handful of performances — some at Ground Zero’s open mic nights; some with his peers and instructors; and some for his close friends. 
Over the summer, Walsh and his band Williker produced a five-track EP called for good, which was released Nov. 22 on Soundcloud. Walsh cited some common themes in his project: heartbreak, having fun and coming of age. Beyond the bluesy and smooth rock feel of the songs, it became clear that his work was not just any music — it was a genuine reflection of his feelings, his words and his voice.

He knows he’s come a long way, but there is still more work to do. Every night, Walsh sits in bed with a small notebook, jotting down ideas and putting words together. Although he admits that not every piece he has written is perfect, the singer-songwriter still tries his best to write at least two songs a week.
For Walsh, the future seems slightly uncertain and unsettling. At times, it seems as if everything is transparent — he’ll continue to write music, perform with Williker and live his dream as a musician. Other times, the view is muddled and murky. But as an artist, he tries his best to remain optimistic while pursuing a career in the ever-changing music industry. 
“The dream is to become a songwriter full-time,” Walsh said. “But other than that, I want to get into music publishing, working with songwriters, getting their songs out there and fitting them with artists so their great songs can be heard.”
With two years almost completed in Thornton’s music industry program, Walsh continues to find inspiration everyday from fellow artists and musicians at USC. Keeping his goals in mind, Walsh hopes that one day, these dreams will become a reality. 
“Kansas City was great for me, but USC has really helped me grow in my songwriting and where I want to take my musical direction,” he said. 
Though the future is still unclear for the young artist, Walsh will continue to do the things he loves most — strumming his guitar, writing music and playing with his friends. No matter what happens, as long as he has music, Walsh knows that he’ll live a happy life. 
“There’s nothing else in my life that gives me as much purpose as much as music does,” Walsh said, with a wide grin on his face.

On Monday, USC’s nine a cappella groups came together at Tommy’s Place to perform and recruit new members in a captivating concert — All Hail 2017: A Cappella Concert. The event was hosted by USC’s UnderSCore, the school’s musical theatre, community service-based a cappella group.  Groups performed one after another, each unique in their own musical way. Some, such as The Sirens, have performed at Los Angeles Clippers games, others have released their own albums and some have even entered the finals for the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
In front of a full crowd, the Sirens, an all-female a cappella group, kicked off the night with three relatable songs about boy troubles. The Sirens were established in 1997 and have performed all over Los Angeles with a song repertoire from old tunes to pop. The girls have notably performed at a Clippers basketball game and were featured in the Best of Collegiate A Cappella album.
Next were The Trogons, USC’s East Asian a cappella group founded in 2013. These performers focused on songs related to East Asian culture and also performed actual Mandarin songs. Whether it was their rendition of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from Mulan or the mashup of two of the most popular Mandarin songs in the past decade, they certainly brought something new to the night.
Asli Baat, USC’s South Asian a cappella group, serves as another example of diversity within the a capella field on campus. This group combines Western and South Asian music to create a unique balance between American Top 40 songs and Bollywood. On stage, Asli Baat started with Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” before smoothly transitioning to contemporary South Asian music, impressing the crowd in multiple languages.
Troy Tones, a prestigious coed team formed in 2002, pulled off an impressive performance, dedicating its last song to one of its co-founders who happened to be in the audience. The team released 10 tracks on Spotify in December 2015 and pride themselves on spreading their music both on and off campus. Troy Tones’ soloist’s falsetto in the second song blew the crowd away,  and their version of Sia’s “Elastic Heart” captivated the audience.
Overflow, a coed Christian a capella group founded in 2010, warmed up the audience’s hearts with inspiring ballads. The group, which usually performs uplifting ballads and Christian songs, definitely did not disappoint Monday night.
The Sirens is the only all-female a capella group on campus, and The Trojan Men is their all-male counterpart within the a capella scene. Their lively performance engaged the crowd, and the group’s good-natured humor won over the audience. After performing two songs in perfect harmony, the Trojan Men ended their performance with the hilarious “Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf,” a comedy piece. The song caused giggles to erupt across the room and lightened the atmosphere.
The hosts of the event, UnderSCore, transitioned from making jokes about Shrek memes to performing professionally within seconds. Founded in 2013, the group prides itself on its focus on philanthropy and musical theater focus. Dazzling in an ensemble of black and red, UnderSCore delivered with two playful and dynamic arrangements of “Pop” by NSYNC and “Please Don’t Say You Love Me” by Gabrielle Aplin. For their finale, the group impressed audiences with a soulful and theatric performance of “The Room Where it Happens,” a popular track from the renowned musical Hamilton.
Perhaps the most well-known and oldest a capella group on campus, the SoCal VoCals awed the audience with flawless vocals and enthusiastic performance. The group performed for former President Barack Obama last year over winter break at the White House. From the heartfelt “Georgia” to the powerful “Feeling Good” to the upbeat rendition of USC’s alma mater, the SoCal VoCals delivered a thoroughly exciting performance that leaves no doubt to their fame.
To close off the night, Reverse Osmosis blew the crowd away with their three-song performance. This coed group, founded in 2001, has countless accolades and was even featured in a documentary titled Rock and R.O. On Monday night, soloists belted out impossibly high notes, performed with passion and earned loud cheers from the audience.       
All Hail 2017: A Capella Concert served as an event for the various a capella organizations on campus to showcase their talents. However, in order for these groups to keep thriving, they must keep recruiting new members. 
From Tuesday to Thursday, there will be auditions held at different locations for each a capella organization on campus. More information can be found on each group’s website.

In the wake of yesterday morning’s Academy Award nomination announcements, Hollywood celebrates as huge advancements in diversity rocket the movies of 2016 past the #OscarsSoWhite controversy that has plagued the past two years. Historical, revealing, raw — the nominated films starring people of color illuminate, as they always do, the lives and trials of people whose faces are rarely seen on-screen. Individually, each of these films is a work of art, resonating with audiences in its own universal way. In Lion, it is the search for family; in Moonlight, it is a love that sustains an entire life.
Yes, it is a day to celebrate. But part of me wishes I could reach out and take Hollywood’s hand before it starts patting itself on the back too soon. As a screenwriting major and a woman of color concerned with social justice, I am simultaneously giddy for this step forward but wary of the congratulations that come with it. It is an annoying side effect of being an activist, perhaps, that I am never quite happy with the progress the world incrementally offers. Nevertheless, it keeps me fired up — it lets me enjoy the fantastic news while keeping my head in the good fight for the long run.
The short of it is that a fantastic year for minority actors and their films does not heal the wounds from #OscarsSoWhite — not when the film industry’s stubborn homogeneity is one that stretches back a century, once mocked people of color with gross caricatures and continues to stereotype and diminish women and people of color. If Hollywood is an institution, then its flaws are systemic. They are deep grooves cut into stone, ones that cannot be amended by a few good years of motion forward. 
Out of the nine films nominated for Best Picture this year, four star people of color as leads. This is a tremendous stride, one that cannot and should not go by unrecognized. And yet this achievement is also an anomaly — in both the diversity and subject matter of these films. What’s striking about Lion, Moonlight, Fences and Hidden Figures is that three out of four are based in the present day. Hidden Figures, an important and critically acclaimed film about black female mathematicians at NASA, is set in the 1960s. In itself a joyous and universal picture, Hidden Figures also harkens back to a trend of prestigious films made about historical people of color.
In the past decade, roughly 10 films have been nominated for Best Picture starring people of color (rough because I am also counting the Asian American Russell from Up, which is an animated movie — yes, the plight of minorities is that bad in cinema). It goes without saying that these nominated pictures were not the only movies made about people of color in the last 10 years; yet, four of those 10 films (Selma, 12 Years a Slave, Django Unchained and The Help) were about or set during historical events. Obviously, the Academy likes historical drama, but it is curious to me how this genre envelopes practically half of the diverse pictures nominated. Is it easier to applaud minority characters from the past than from the present?
If movies, as works of art, are vessels that help us realize empathy and universal truths, then it is as important to tell stories about people from the present as it is to tell stories about people in the past. It is perhaps easier to watch Hidden Figures and grow angry at the obvious racism and sexism these women had to face than it is to watch Moonlight and fathom the prejudice that still exists in the present. That’s why I’m so happy about this year’s nominations, which include a bit of everything: the past and the present, encompassing diversity in multiple ways. 
As a woman of color, the scripts I write mostly star women of color. Most of them are set in the present, and I’m glad I’m seeing the scope of cinema’s imagination finally extending to minorities in the modern world. My point is not that historical and biopic movies starring people of color are pointless — the opposite, actually. These movies are indescribably valuable in uncovering the role minorities played in building American history. 
But my longing for more grounded, diverse drama has personal roots that I’m sure resonate with young artists all over. The wistfulness I feel toward Hollywood is split between longing to see on-screen Asian American faces like mine and longing to see on-screen stories like the ones I write today. The past is a huge, magnetic cavern to explore, and indeed its stories are worth telling. But imagination is also as expansive as the universe, one that stretches farther and farther away. And what is crucial for artists concerned with diversity is to certainly harvest stories from the past, but also to guide audiences toward picturing a present and future in which minorities and women make greater strides.

Many scientists now believe that the universe is expanding at an accelerating pace, but this phenomenon was first discovered by Adam Riess, a Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist. Riess spoke at Bovard Auditorium on Monday about measurements of distant supernova that led to his discovery as part of the USC Dornsife Irene McCullouch Distinguished Lecture series.
“The reason I got into this field was to answer profound questions like when did the universe begin,” Riess said. “I wanted to devise and perform real science experiments to answer these.”
Riess has held the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorship, the Thomas J. Barber Professorship of Physics and Astronomy and the Krieger-Eisenhower Professorship of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. He is also a senior member of the science staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute.
Along with Brian Schmidt and Saul Perlmutter, Riess received the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for providing evidence that supported the phenomenon. The scientists were also awarded the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and shared the $1 million Shaw Prize in Astronomy in 2006. Along with his other awards, Riess was also honored with the Albert Einstein Medal in 2011 and the 2008 MacArthur Fellowship.
According to Riess, one of the most important unsolved problems in cosmology and astrophysics is understanding the unexplained and mysterious nature of dark energy. While discussing the discovery of the accelerating universe, Riess explained that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it will appear to recede.
“The key is to measure how far away the galaxies are and how fast they recede from us,” Riess said. “In particular, measuring distance is the hardest thing to do in space.”
The distances on earth are measured using various methods such as parallax, lighthouses, foghorns and objects of known size. However, these methods involve human creations, so in space, distance measurement uses the standard candle approach.
“A galaxy has millions of stars that have known luminosity and can be used as standard candles,” Riess said. “When one of these stars explodes, it could be as bright as 4 billion times the luminosity of the sun. In addition, the inverse square law states that intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity.”
The other property that Riess and his team needed to measure is the speed at which the galaxies are rushing away from the earth. They did so by looking at the nature of the light coming from distant objects.
“A supernova emits light at known wavelengths, and because of the expansion of space, the wavelengths are stretched [and] it gets redder,” Riess said. “This redshift measures the apparent recession velocity of the galaxies.”
The Hubble Constant, H0, which is the measured slope or the linear relation between the velocity and distance, gives the present expansion rate of the universe. If the universe would contract instead of expand, then this slope would be negative.
According to Riess, we can measure that expansion rate by using the Hubble Constant. By taking the inverse of the rate, the approximate age of the universe can be calculated.
“It is not very likely to stare at one galaxy and find a supernova,” Riess said. “However, if you stare at 100 galaxies for one year, you are likely to see a supernova, and if you stare at 1,000 galaxies, you will see 10 supernovae in a year.”
Riess studied four supernovae in his thesis. He discovered accelerating expansion and dark energy in 1998 and confirmed it with more distant supernovae from the Hubble telescope. In 2009, they could find tens of supernovae at greater distances.
“The supernovae slowly showed us that the universe was decelerating before it slowly started accelerating,” Riess said. “So we removed both models that we thought we were choosing between and ended up with this new model when the universe began to accelerate five billion years ago.”
The reason for the acceleration of the universe remains unknown. Riess and his team have hypothesized that the source is vacuum energy, also known as the cosmological constant, dynamical dark energy or modified gravity. They also expect to learn more about the nature of dark energy in the next decade from a spate of different measurements, including a refurbished Hubble Space Telescope.

Diversity and Inclusion Training Week started Monday and will continue in a series of seminars, training and exercises throughout the week. 
The purpose of the event is to eliminate unconscious biases and to increase diversity in the workplace. 
In addition, faculty will examine how to better focus on inclusion in teaching in order to engage a diverse student population and provide a safe space for sensitive topics.
“We all have assumptions about what diversity and inclusion are, but may not realize our own behavior or our lack of knowledge could in fact be helping to maintain a less diverse, less inclusive, less respectful place for us to be together in,” said Stephen Smith, co-chair of the Academic Senate’s Campus Climate Committee and an event speaker.
He hopes that the event will have an effect on interactions between students and faculty.
“It will send a very clear message from the University that diversity and inclusion is important to the entire community and that faculty are encouraged to be role models, as well as to know their responsibilities,” Smith said.
During sessions this week, faculty from many departments will present their findings on topics regarding diversity in an effort to educate their audience. 
Sessions include “Strategies for Talking About Race and Racism in the Classroom,” “Implicit Bias Training Workshop,” “Empowering First Generation College Students — Understanding Stereotype Threat Interventions,” “Trans Wellness Panel” and “STEM: Inclusive Engineering for Everyone.”
Through participating in this event, professors all want to increase diversity both on campus and in their specific areas of expertise.
Anthony Maddox, a professor of clinical education and engineering, shared his plans to develop a Center for Engineering in Education to explore the potential impact of teaching engineering at all educational levels with his colleague John Brooks Slaughter.
“Slaughter and I felt that, to some degree, everyone should practice engineering thinking,” Maddox said. “We are committed to creating ways for engineering to be more accessible to people and increase opportunities for them to apply such thinking in life’s activities.” 
He believes that the key to moving forward is not to be afraid of technology, but instead to learn and take advantage of it.
“We believe that through non-formal and informal learning, more people may consider how engineering thinking can improve their lives and offer new perspectives of the increasingly technology-rich world around them,” Maddox said.
Smith, on the other hand, expressed his hope to introduce members of the faculty to the resources of the USC Shoah Foundation, an organization dedicated to gathering experiences of survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides.
“We have 54,000 people in our archive whose personal life histories give insight into human behavior,” Smith said.  “The resources are available in educational settings, from middle school through higher education.  We will use the event to introduce the content to faculty for use in their own classrooms.”
