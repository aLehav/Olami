Amid the fear, caution and social distancing surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, sports fans should be delighted to hear that the world’s most exciting corporate board meeting has been renewed for yet another season.
Yes, the NFL Draft will continue as planned at the end of April and fans will finally have their long-standing need for live entertainment satiated by the most dramatic turn-based strategy game in the world of sports.
The draft — undoubtedly one of the most popular sports events on the annual calendar — has stood as a bastion for the bored sports fan in the spring for decades. Often a means of escape for the lonely football fan or the recovering March Madness addict, the draft offers a three-day journey to a world where it is not the players or coaches but rather front offices and general managers who are scrutinized, second-guessed and exposed for strategical flaws, minor or major. In this facet, the ultimate sports offseason event is simply unsurpassed by its contemporaries in the NBA, NHL and MLB.
Obviously, the context of this year’s extravaganza is distinctly depressing, yet also unique. In many ways, the NFL Draft is the perfect event for the coronavirus-trapped world in which we now live. Aside from iconic “powerhouse” quarantine sports such as marble racing and the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series, the NFL Draft is the perfect enterprise to weather a storm that has otherwise ravaged the rest of the traditional collegiate and professional athletics landscape.
Easily suited to the online-only environment of the quarantined United States while cutting down on arguably cheesy staples such as the backstage draft room, the draft is primed to be as popular as it has ever been despite being conducted from the safety and seclusion of the NFL’s collective couch.
All said, there are plenty of those both within and separate from the NFL that feel that the draft’s continuation is a poor decision on behalf of the league. A few weeks prior, an unnamed NFL executive took umbrage with the concept of the draft taking place as scheduled. Among many issues, they cited the concept that in-person visits, private workouts and pro days all contribute to a team’s preparedness and to do away with such activities puts all teams at risk and a hearty disadvantage compared to years past. This, ultimately, is where the 2020 NFL Draft finds its most compelling showdown.
Who is this year’s draft truly meant to benefit: the teams or the fans?
In a world of isolation, the sports fan has shown to be surprisingly creative and divinely inspired to concoct new ways of self-entertainment. From the aforementioned marble racing — the Marbula One season just concluded with an absolute stunner of a run — to betting on eSports simulations in Madden and NBA 2K, the sports fan has begun to resemble a hermit. While creative, these escapes are clear proof that the average sports fan is going through unprecedented levels of withdrawal. As such, the draft has been tabbed by society to be an event that simply must go on despite the objection of some of its own participants.
Simply put, the League’s premier offseason showcase has been commandeered as a public good in the face of the pandemic. This event is no longer simply about where Tua Tagovailoa will land and how many wideouts are selected in the first round but rather about healing the soul of a wounded nation and providing folks an escape from the mundane and the maddening.
As such, we will watch on proudly at the end of April. As we hold hope for the best for USC’s Michael Pittman Jr. and Austin Jackson — as well as for the fortune of our favorite professional teams — we will collectively enjoy the distraction that the draft provides; however momentary or fleeting, we sports fans will take the opportunity and run with it.
The draft must — and thankfully will — go on, and its healing touch will help a country in quarantine.

Members of the USC Figure Skating Club huddled together on the ice to chant the “SoCal Spell Out” in front of skaters from across the country. It was February 2019 and the club was celebrating a new feat: It had sent a team to compete at every level in the 2019 Ride the Tide event in San Diego.
It was a pivotal moment for the club — it had finally established itself as the legitimate figure skating presence that it has been ever since.
“To me, [the message] was ‘USC is here, and we’re strong, and we’re not going to go anywhere anytime soon,’” said Nicole Wong, a USC alumna who co-founded the club in 2016 and served as club president for the 2018-19 school year.
Wong and fellow alumna Erika Chang-Sing realized they had many friends at USC who were also passionate about skating, so the duo started the club to encourage their peers to keep up with skating in a fun, low-stakes environment.
At first, Wong, Chang-Sing and their friends were the only four skaters at the Pasadena Ice Skating Center each week. Since its inaugural semester, USCFSC has grown to 27 members and has attracted experienced and beginner skaters alike to join its ranks.
Even for those who skated every morning in high school, balancing skating with the demands of college can prove difficult. USCFSC president Zoe Perez, a senior studying history, joined the club in her freshman year to continue the sport she had devoted so much time to in a less competitive environment.
“For me, stopping competing was really hard, and I didn’t want to quit skating cold turkey,” Perez said. “This just seemed like a really low-pressure way to keep the sport in my life.”
Although many members have skated previously, some are relatively new to the ice. Hannah Nowak, a senior studying arts, technology and the business of innovation, joined the club this semester to try something new on campus. An Ohio native, Nowak skated as a child but lost the majority of her skills during her long hiatus from the ice. However, she said she still felt at home in the club despite lacking the decade-long experience of some of her peers.
“I have not met a more welcoming group of people to just be like ‘We don’t care that you suck because you’re great and we want to be your friend,’” Nowak said. “I’m a perfectionist, so not being at their level was a really hard concept for me to get over, but the minute I was there, [I realized] these are nice people who are talented.”
The low-pressure atmosphere of the club also attracts those who followed an unconventional path to competitive skating. Willow Cai, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, had a semester off from high school and taught herself to skate using YouTube videos.
Cai tuned into the 2018 Winter Olympics and was fascinated by the figure skating events, so when she decided to pick up a sport in her free time, she knew she wanted that sport to be skating. The aspiring skater spent five hours a day at her local rink, learning basic techniques before attempting spins and jumps.
Cai decided to continue learning by joining USCFSC during her first semester as a Trojan in 2018.
“I joined the club because I thought I might be able to learn from the other people in the club who have been skating for a much longer time,” she said. “[I like] having people to skate with … and just being able to wear my skating apparel everywhere and be like, ‘My fun fact is I figure skate.’”
Unlike some student organizations at USC, USCFSC welcomes undergraduate and graduate students, allowing for members to get to know people they might not otherwise meet. The club has a booth each semester at the Involvement Fair, where interested students can sign up to skate.
Nathan Dennler, a graduate student studying computer science, brings competitive experience from his high school and undergraduate years to the team.
“I wanted to keep it up and have a way to stay active during grad school doing things that I enjoy,” Dennler said. “It’s also really nice being on a team of people, too, to keep me motivated.”
Members drag themselves out of bed every Wednesday around 4 a.m. to make the 5-6 a.m. time slot at the rink. During this practice, members learn or refine their skills and rehearse programs for upcoming shows and competitions.
The club hosts an annual December showcase at L.A. Live that includes solo and group performances by members across myriad backgrounds and skill sets. Soloists have the opportunity to craft their own routines and select their music. Even if a skater chooses not to perform a solo, they come out on the ice to take a bow as an announcer reads their biography aloud. 
Wong said the club’s first L.A. Live show in 2018 was the moment she realized she had achieved her goal of bringing together a diverse and supportive group with a passion for skating.
“I just remember the whole team coming together and having this massive hug in the middle of the ice when it was over,” Wong said. “Seeing people who were there to support the skaters was so heartwarming because it was the moment when I felt like we had support within our own team and we had support from others.”
Along with their annual showcase, the skaters take part in several competitions each year. In February, the club sent skaters to the Golden Bears Skate in Oakland, Calif., and the Pioneer Open in Denver. Three Trojans medaled at the Golden Bears Skate, while Lillian Zeng, a sophomore majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, took silver at the Pioneer Open.
Even though many members choose to take part in these competitions, the club’s environment is not always so serious. Seasoned skaters carve out time on the ice to help beginners, and the less experienced skaters aren’t afraid to laugh at their mistakes.
“There was this time on the ice where I was trying to record what I was doing and I fell so hard, like I just tripped over myself, and it caused this ripple chain reaction of everyone else behind me,” Nowak said. “They started falling in the middle of their jumps and I caught it all on video and it was hilarious.”
Cai admitted to falling time and time again as she learned to skate, leading her to pick up a new injury seemingly every day. It’s been important for the club to keep the energy light despite any mistakes on the ice, as it takes a lot of resiliency to become a skilled skater.
Wong, who has been skating since she was 4 years old, agreed that skating isn’t always pretty.
“I feel like figure skating is especially one of those things that people look at and they see the dresses and the makeup and the glamor that people associate with figure skating,” Wong said. “It takes a lot more than looking pretty to accomplish things in this sport and train and practice and build the character that you do as a figure skater.”
With skating’s status as a niche sport comes numerous other stereotypes as to what it means to be a skater. While the long hours, early mornings and tough falls that skaters endure tend to be viewed as overly intense by outsiders, USCFSC works to counterbalance the individual pressures of the sport by creating a collaborative, enjoyable environment. The club aims to make members feel as though they are on the same team even though they often compete against each other in competitions.
“Because it’s college, everyone’s super supportive and it’s not as cutthroat as maybe skating is perceived in the media,” Perez said. “We all hang out together, anyone can come to our competitions and shows, so I think it’s fostered a really good environment.”
Wong said some of the club’s most important lessons apply to life off the ice.
“You’re teaching them how to be a part of a community, you’re teaching each other how to be friends and just everything about the culture of the sport is what you’re learning in addition to the technique,” she said.
The community, united by a love for skating, has provided its members a home away from home at USC. Cai, an international student from China, said her skating family has been instrumental in helping her feel at home at USC.
“My first competition in San Diego, I was doing two elements in a team event and I kind of screwed up one of them, but my teammates were super supportive,” Cai said. “They were still cheering when I messed up and made me feel super safe and loved … It felt like I [was] with family which is really comforting for me.”

When you enter an orientation session for the incoming class of School of Cinematic Arts students, the presenter will tell the entire audience, “This is the first day of the rest of your career.”
Around the room may be production, screenwriting or animation and digital arts students, all entering into programs that offer labs, practicals and seminars that directly correlate with the work they may do in the field. But for cinema and media studies students, this message might not seem applicable.
Despite asserting that the major prepares students to work in media and entertainment fields, as a foundation for jobs in talent, management, production, or studio work, the sparse and seemingly impractical coursework for CAMS students reflects otherwise.
In order to aptly prepare CAMS students for post-graduate life and to match the practical rigor that is provided for the other majors within the film school, SCA must offer concentrations that complement incoming students’ interests and bolster their career aspirations.
Currently, the curriculum for CAMS majors follows the same sorts of early requirements that other students in the film school also must complete. But beyond the classic “Introduction to Cinema” and “History of the International Cinema I & II,” the only practice-based course that CAMS majors are required to take is “Cinematic Communication,” better known as 290. 
CAMS students are encouraged to take 290 in the spring semester of their junior year to be with students within their major (instead of with the big production kids). They are met with other CAMS students that are simply trying to get through the course or those that are excited about this type of curriculum and simply waiting to transfer to a different major within the film school. 
Beyond 290, CAMS students are required to complete four upper-division electives, which feature some interesting topics such as “Censorship in Cinema,” “Transmedia Entertainment” and “Practicum in Film/Television Criticism.” But Norris Cinema Theater and SCA 108 are the classrooms loaned out to the more “popular” electives, including “Marvel,” “Hitchcock” and “The Cinema of Quentin Tarantino.” 
While fun and academically stimulating, these electives don’t teach anything practical, such as how to extend undergraduate studies into academia beyond writing a term paper. And even though students can take courses in one of the other programs, they don’t count toward the major, exacerbating students’ course loads and sending them down a rabbit hole of D-clearance and advising check-offs.
While bachelor of arts programs in film studies are rather sparse on the undergraduate and graduate levels, there are other programs in the United States that provide their students with greater structure. The cinema and media studies major at Boston University requires students to complete 11 courses of foundational work with courses focusing on cinema in at least three regions of the world, including Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa and Europe, along with the UnitedStates. At Stanford University, students declare the film and media studies major along with their preferred concentration, either culture and criticism or screenwriting.
At USC, there is an entire faculty at SCA with expertise in fields that cover more than just the basics. The cinema and media studies major could benefit from concentrations in international media, which could function like the international relations major from a bachelor of arts standpoint and require an in-depth historical and linguistic understanding to complement a specific region’s film culture. 
For students interested in academia, there can be a concentration where students are required to take a thesis course or multiple courses that encourage the publishing of academic work and pairs students with a mentor to help gain insight into graduate school and beyond. 
And for those wanting to pursue film criticism, adding more than one elective focusing on the subject and creating writing seminars similar to those in the screenwriting department, where the professor functions more as an editor, can lead a student in the right path. 
Additionally, the film school could partner with more than just the Marshall School of Business to provide students with greater practical opportunities. Along with the business cinematic arts major (which is only open to freshmen, so sorry everybody else), SCA could partner with the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism to create combined majors such as film journalism or public relations for the entertainment industry. Students shouldn’t have to scramble to find the right minor or load up on miscellaneous classes just to find the right fit. 
For a film school that was ranked No. 1 for the seventh year in the row by The Hollywood Reporter, it seems obvious that every student should get the same support — not just those that are going through the same production program as famous alumni and donors once did. 
Now, more than ever, media studies are critical in analyzing the expansion of international content into more mainstream and popular venues in the United States.; it’s inescapable. SCA should be at the forefront in helping their students meet these increasing demands.

Days after public health officials issued warnings to stop nonessential travel and practice social distancing to combat the coronavirus pandemic, college students flocked to the beaches of Miami for spring break and visitors crowded the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. to see the cherry blossoms. “If I get corona, I get corona” was the sentiment behind many people’s decision to brush off public health warnings. 
Many people, especially low-income individuals and essential workers, do not have the option of social distancing. But for those who do and choose not to, the continued dismissal of quarantine policies has been both baffling and frustrating to workers at the frontline battling the pandemic. This dismissive mentality is deeply rooted in neuropsychological factors, which help both elucidate and combat the kind of negligent behavior displayed by spring breakers and cherry blossom tourists.
Mobilizing large groups to take action has posed a challenge long before the current outbreak, and it first made headlines in psychology with the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. Despite plenty of neighbors who heard Genovese screaming as she was attacked outside her apartment, no one intervened or called 911. This group tendency toward inaction is attributed to diffusion of responsibility, a phenomenon where individuals are less likely to act in a group context because they assume that others will shoulder responsibility. However, in a pandemic that can spread through asymptomatic carriers, each individual poses a risk, and it is critical for everyone to take the necessary precautions.
This refusal to take on individual responsibility could also stem in part from optimism bias, first described in the 1980s by psychologist Neil Weinstein as the tendency for people to believe they are less susceptible to potential risks, such as disease, than others. In a survey of 4,348 people in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland conducted in late February this year, half of the respondents believed they were less likely to be infected than the general population.
This sense of invincibility is especially heightened in young adults, like the college students who vacationed in Florida. As Harvard neuroscientist Leah Somerville explains, the frontal lobe, which is responsible for rational thinking and impulse control, is the last part of the brain to fully mature and continues developing into age 30, meaning that the compulsive, emotion-driven parts of the brain often dominate decision-making until then. 
These findings are especially relevant with the coronavirus, which disproportionately harms elderly populations. For young adults who may not believe themselves to be at risk, poor judgment leads them to prioritize trivial matters over the well-being of others and neglect the long-term consequences of their actions.
Until the virus directly affects you, it can be easy to distance yourself from it and operate under a false sense of security. The most prominent example of this came from NBA player Rudy Gobert, who openly mocked the severity of the coronavirus in a press conference, only to be diagnosed with it a few days later. Expressing remorse over his actions, Gobert wrote on Instagram, “I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.”
Looking beyond the role of individual responsibility, social distancing may pose a unique challenge because humans are innately social creatures. In a study conducted in 2015 that simulated social distancing behavior in an epidemic, researchers from the University of Strathclyde found a discrepancy between participants’ intention to practice social distancing and whether or not they actually went through with it; significantly more people intended to socially distance than the number who actually did. As Dr. Wendy L. Patrick, the author of a book on the psychology of attraction, points out, these findings imply that cutting out social contact is aversive to people, even when they are aware of the importance and benefits of doing so.
Furthermore, a study by USC associate professor Sarah Townsend found that surrounding ourselves with those going through the same crisis lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol, indicating that stressful situations like the current pandemic heighten our need for social interaction on a biological level, which can be hard to ignore.
Although carrying on with regularly scheduled plans and going out to see friends may be enjoyable, it can directly put vulnerable populations and the entire health care system at risk. As the number of coronavirus cases rises exponentially and hospitals become overwhelmed, it is crucial for each of us to look at the bigger picture and recognize the role we can play in flattening the curve by engaging in social distancing.

When Zach Mollo, the vice president of engagements of the Rebel, Innovators, Startups and Entrepreneurs consulting club, heard that USC was sending its students home for the semester, the first thing he did was contact the club’s clients to assure them that operations would still continue throughout the semester using online platforms like Zoom and FaceTime.
“Most [RISE members] are still pretty excited about their engagement,” said Mollo, a junior majoring in economics. “The ones we did have to cancel, the people were reassigned to move things around so they can actually participate this semester.” 
As the coronavirus pandemic continues in California and the United States, USC has taken action to mitigate risks, including requesting that students in University-owned housing return home if they are able, while city and state governments have imposed limits on gatherings of 10 or more people. As a result, the various programs, special events, conferences and campus activities organized by USC’s student organizations have been either canceled or moved online. 
Artemis, a multimedia production organization that allows students to explore and create intersectional feminism art, moved its meetings online when the University made classes virtual.
“We’re trying as much as possible to keep meeting as frequently as we would be if we were still back at USC,” said Abigail Swoap, co-president of Artemis. “We’ve organized a weekly Zoom meeting where we use our USC Zoom accounts to just meet online like we would normally.”
As classes moved online, clubs have had to modify their event schedules. The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly postponed or canceled its sponsored events. The assembly was planning to hold an L.A. Live “Mulan” film screening and a heritage festival this semester along with culture nights from member organizations such as the Vietnamese Student Association and the Nikkei Student Union, APASA external community chair Justin Kawaguchi said. 
“A lot of different programming initiatives and events have been planned for the semester [for] the month of the Asian Pacific American Heritage Festival,” said Kawaguchi, a junior majoring in global health. “Because of the movement to go online, all of that has been canceled.” 
Left with additional funds and no events to spend them on, some organizations, like the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, plan to put the money back into the USC community. QuASA executive director Steven Vargas also said the group’s programming events have been canceled, but QuASA is looking to contribute its resources to the mutual aid fund, an initiative announced by Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone during his State of USG address. The student government will provide a $70,000 grant for the USC Student Basic Needs Fund, which assists students experiencing housing or food insecurity resulting from circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Our main thing is that we program events that kind of like put us out for the rest of the semester,” Vargas said. “So what we decided to pivot toward was just providing resources and kind of preparing for next year instead.”
While many organizations have opted to delay events, some chose to move them to a virtual format similar to the way classes are held. The LGBT Resource Center has also moved to provide virtual programming including a digital Queer and Trans People of Color Lounge and QuaTRO, the group’s new remote book club. Other cultural centers, including La CASA, have also moved event and activity offerings online. 
Recruiting schedules for organizations such as the Spirit of Troy, Song Girls and Trojan Dance Crew have also been impacted by the online transition. Dates for recruitment are currently unknown with the Song girls and Spirit of Troy but the Trojan Dance Crew have announced virtual auditions to start April 27. While practicing social distancing, the Song Girls have maintained a virtual practice schedule, and the band continues to practice its classic football anthems. 
The Trojan Marching Band recruitment and the fall marching season remains uncertain until further notice from administration, said Brett Padelford, the band’s public relations director. 
Funding is another issue organizations face as the University combats financial uncertainty. Nathaniel Hyman, co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, said the organization had planned to host a sustainability forum April 30 before it was canceled. He said he was concerned about how USC’s loss of revenue during the coronavirus pandemic would affect the assembly’s funding.
“That email that came out yesterday about the University being in financial dire straits is going to likely impact our capital projects,” Hyman said. “I do not know how that’s going to impact our investment into making University more sustainable.” 
Many organizations have chosen to finish up their last few spring projects and start planning for the fall semester. For RISE, this means reaching out to potential new business contacts to partner with, while Artemis is in the beginning of their application process for new artists to present in the coming semester. 
“Luckily, we finished up with our big project this semester, and now we’re in this phase where we’re starting to look for pitches for new projects that we’ll be working on throughout the summer and next year,” Swoap said.
For organizations like Marshall Student Ambassadors, spring is typically the busiest season because of campus visits from admitted students. MSA, which works with the Marshall School of Business Admissions to provide support to prospective students, had planned to participate in seven admissions events this semester, but the last three moved to a virtual format after the University canceled in-person events.
“We’re just kind of having to double our online efforts just to make sure that admitted students still feel like we’re invested in them even though we can’t have that face-to-face connection,” said MSA social media director Emily Strauss, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Throughout the year, Unruh Associates, an organization focused on civic engagement and bipartisan civil discussion, has transitioned to holding speaker events remotely. The organization has sponsored political discussions on the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates’ campaigns, student forums and debates on current social issues among other events, which the organization has shifted online. 
“One silver lining is that with Zoom, we don’t need to worry about programming issues like classroom space,” said Unruh Associates President Tommy Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in history and international relations. “We can bring in political figures and professionals like Congressman Katie Porter — we’re hoping to bring her on to the [Unruh Associates] because she’s the one that guaranteed free COVID-19 testing.” 
The transition from in-person to virtual meetings presents challenges for some organizations, which have cited issues such as time zone differences, poor internet connection and a lack of motivation to continue club activities in the absence of face-to-face interaction. 
“I think it’s definitely a tough time, and everyone is really worried about just each other, you know, health and safety primarily,” Strauss said. “It seems like everybody has a pretty good attitude about it. You know, everybody understands that it’s kind of a situation that’s out of anyone’s control.”
