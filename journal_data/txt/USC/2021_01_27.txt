It was once known as America’s favorite pastime, but now baseball is sadly becoming an afterthought in the American sports landscape. As faster paced, higher energy sports like basketball and football continue to grow in popularity, baseball is being left behind. 
On Monday morning, the MLB Players Association rejected a proposal from the league to include a universal designated hitter and expand the playoff format. Other ideas circulating included implementing a pitch clock, limiting the number of pitchers to speed up the pace of play and electronic strike zones.
But MLB is focusing on the wrong issues. People aren’t going to start watching baseball because strikes and balls are called by a computer. The bigger issue is that the games are too predictable and don’t have enough action. So, what went wrong, and how does MLB fix it? The best place to start is with the baseball itself, and I’ll explain why.
Total attendance numbers for MLB peaked in 2007 at over 79 million across a whole season. This number has since steadily declined. TV ratings are even worse: average viewership for the World Series has declined precipitously since the 1970s, from 44.2 million in 1978 to a record low 9.8 million viewers in 2020. 
Also concerning is that baseball’s average audience is significantly older than that of other major American sports, and it continues to age. According to Sports Business Journal, the average viewer of nationally televised MLB games was 57 in 2016, up from 52 in 2000. Another jarring figure is that just 7% of MLB’s viewers are under the age of 18. 
The most obvious explanation for this decrease in popularity aligns with younger generations’ seemingly shrinking attention span and demand for a faster pace than the game of baseball currently offers. In contrast, basketball has incredible athletes and non-stop action. Each and every play in football can change the outcome of an entire game. 
The average MLB game in 2019 lasted three hours and ten minutes, a record-high and a full 40 minutes longer than the average game that 44 million fans watched in 1978. 
It might seem intuitive that more offense and particularly more home runs would make baseball more attractive for younger viewers, especially on TV. Well, in 2014, players hit a reasonable total of 4,186 homers. In 2019, that number ballooned to a ridiculous 6,776— shattering the 6,105 homer record set in 2017. Yet the viewership continues to fall, and the increase in home runs is exactly the problem. 
Home runs are supposed to be exciting, right? Not necessarily. There is a concept in baseball called the “Three True Outcomes.” This refers to at-bats that result in home runs, strikeouts or walks. Let’s imagine that 100% of at-bats resulted in one of these three outcomes. It would be boring to anyone, from casual viewers to fanatics and baseball purists. 
In the 1970s, when baseball viewership reached its peak, 23.1% of at-bats were a true outcome. From 2010-2017 (only halfway through the recent explosion of home runs) that number was 30.4%. Home runs and strikeouts per game reached record highs in 2019, and walks per game reached numbers not seen since the steroid era. Sadly, this is what baseball is becoming. Seven guys in the field spend most of the game waiting for someone to hit a home run or walk back to the bench with his head down. 
Small ball is dead. Gone are the days of sacrifice bunts, stolen bases and the very importance of getting on base. It doesn’t matter if you can run or play defense as long as you hit home runs because computers in front offices say that swinging for the fence every pitch generates more runs over time. 
But what if swinging for the fence wasn’t the best approach? There’s another theory that attempts to explain the amount of home runs being hit lately. MLB denies that the baseballs used in games were changed to increase flight and generate more home runs, but a FiveThirtyEight study found that the baseballs made by Rawlings from the 2016 season onwards are slightly lighter and significantly less dense.
Not only are the newer balls lighter and bouncier, but a second FiveThirtyEight study found that baseballs used since the 2016 season also feature lower seams, making them less air resistant. While these changes are very small, they can add up to fly balls traveling as much as 8.6 feet further. The study expected a 25% increase in home runs with these baseballs. The actual increase from 2014-2017 was 46%. 
Whether or not MLB actually participated in changing the baseball to create more home runs in the first place is not relevant. If the baseball can account for over half of the recent increase in home runs, the league should simply deaden the ball to disincentivize this analytics-fueled home run hitting approach that could be turning people away from baseball. 
Lowering the amount of (boring) true outcomes would bring back some variety to the games and would hopefully increase interest in the sport. Former Chicago Cubs executive Theo Epstein put it nicely: “We need to find a way to get more action in the game, get the ball in play more often, allow players to showcase their athleticism some more.” Figure out how to make the game less predictable. Start with the ball.

Through 15 games, USC’s men’s basketball team has been impressive and unbeatable at times. They currently have a record of 12-3, and they are 6-2 in the Pac-12 — good for second in the conference.
Led by dominant freshman forward Evan Mobley, USC has lost only one game in January. The Trojans swept Arizona and Arizona State on the road for the first time in 36 years and went on a six-game winning streak in the same month.
However, as the toughest part of USC’s schedule awaits, there is clearly still some work to be done. If the Trojans want to compete for the Pac-12 title, they must finish the season strong. 
Teamrankings.com, which uses computer simulations to predict March Madness, currently gives USC a 96.6% chance of making the tournament and a 21.3% chance of an automatic bid through winning the Pac-12 tournament. 
With 11 games remaining, these are five of the most important games left for the Trojans to put themselves in a better position in March. 
Away versus UCLA on Mar. 6
Any game against the Trojans’ crosstown rival is an important one, but the importance of this game cannot be understated. 
No. 23 UCLA has the best record in the conference this season. When it comes to talent, the Bruins stack up well against the Trojans and pose a huge threat. The Bruins have an impressive five players averaging double-digit points, with an additional player averaging 9.9 per game. Clearly, they have more than enough depth to compete with USC. 
Sophomore guard Tyger Campbell has been the heart of the Bruins this season, controlling the pace and flow of UCLA’s offense. He leads his team in assists with 6.2 per game and has also put up 11.7 points per game. 
The foursome of Campbell, senior guard Chris Smith and sophomore guards Johnny Juzang and Jaime Jaquez Jr. figures to be a big problem for the Trojans when the two teams face off. 
The road to the Pac-12 championship will surely go through the Bruins. Beating the Bruins on the road in USC’s last game of the season could also boost the Trojans’ seeding prospects as they look ahead to the NCAA Tournament.
Home versus Oregon (Delayed due to the coronavirus)
Prior to their season being put on hold due to a coronavirus outbreak, the Ducks were the best team in the Pac-12. 
They rattled off eight wins in a row early in their schedule, then lost to Colorado and beat Utah before they were forced to quarantine due to NCAA protocols. Their first game back was a loss to bitter rival Oregon State.
It was not an ideal start, but this is still an extremely talented team with a prolific senior guard in Chris Duarte. Duarte has done much of the work for the Ducks this season, averaging 18.4 points per game. 
Outside of Duarte, Oregon also has a pair of playmakers in senior forward Eugene Omoruyi, who is averaging 16.8 points per game, and junior forward Eric Williams Jr., who is averaging 12.3 points per game.
Away versus Colorado on Feb. 25
Colorado was the last team to beat USC before the Trojans’ ensuing six-game win streak. In a game where sophomore guard Ethan Anderson was out, the play of senior guard McKinley Wright was really the difference maker. With Anderson expected to be available this time around, the Trojans will be keen to even up the season series. 
Similar to the aforementioned games against UCLA and Oregon, a win against Colorado might offer the Trojans’ some momentum before the Pac-12 and NCAA Tournament. A loss, however, would most likely result in a lower seed in the tournament — likely making the path towards a national title more difficult. 
Home versus Stanford on Feb. 2
In a bizarre year in college basketball, the Cardinal might be the best worst team in the Pac-12. 
They beat UCLA in a stunner, handled the Washington schools and Arizona but were blown out by Oregon, Colorado and Utah.
It’s this sort of inconsistency that makes this matchup terrifying for the Trojans. Simply put, USC has to take care of business, avoid a trap game and just beat Stanford. A loss to a struggling Stanford team would be a significant blemish on USC’s resume. 
The Cardinals have a fantastic senior forward in Oscar da Silva. Despite his team’s record, Silva has dominated thus far, averaging 19.8 points per game on 60% shooting.
Combine his play with freshman forward Ziaire Williams and senior guard Daejon Davis, who have had double-digit points in almost every game played, and this is a team with the potential to set back USC’s season.
Defeating beatable teams is what the NCAA Tournament seeding committee looks for when deciding the seeds for the tournament. If USC doesn’t get it done against Stanford, they will have given the seeding committee a decent reason to knock the Trojans down a couple seeds come March.
Home versus Oregon State on Jan. 28
Coming off a three-game span where they beat Arizona State, USC and Oregon, the Beavers are rolling. If the Trojans dropped another game to the Beavers — who despite impressive recent performances still sit at No.7 in the conference standings — the loss would give the seeding committee reason to hesitate when evaluating the Trojans’ record. 
Oregon State has the ability to pull off an upset, as evidenced by the fact that they already snapped USC’s win streak last week. Because of USC’s impressive record thus far, a loss likely wouldn’t doom the Trojan’s NCAA Tournament prospects, but still, avenging their previous loss to the Beavers could go a long way in building some momentum heading into February and March.

Being a part of the LGBTQ+ community in a time before 2015 brought pitfalls, and being at USC was no exception. The students of the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work in the 1990s experienced othering throughout their time at USC. 
USC’s part in LGBTQ+ history
Historically, the LGBTQ+ community has faced oppression that still surviving in the present. A timeline provided by the USC LGBTQ+ Student Center looks back at the community’s pivotal moments on campus.  
A year after the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York, USC’s only openly gay member of staff at the time, Director of the Foreign Language Lab Del Whan, started the Gay Liberation Forum. The GLF was the first LGBTQ+ student group; the members were predominantly male with Whan being the only woman member.
In 1971, the Board of Trustees voted to deny the GLF visibility as a student organization. The Academic Senate requested the trustees reconsider their action, but the organization was denied recognition once again. 
The following  year, the GLF pursued legal action against the University. The suit proceeded and in 1975, the Gay Student Union (formerly the GLF) gained recognition from the trustees to be a student organization.
In 1982, the Gay and Lesbian Student Union put on their first Gay Awareness Week, garnering endorsements from Gov. Jerry Brown, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and actresses Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. 
In 1986, the Lambda LGBT Alumni Association, originally unassociated with USC, held their first homecoming festivities at Mudd Hall, but it wasn’t until 1990 that Lambda was officially invited to join the Trojan Family in celebrating homecoming. 
USC created a policy in 1989 for students, staff and faculty who had been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS to be granted access to all normal services, activities and programs and acknowledged that HIV could not be transmitted by casual contact. 
A 50-foot rainbow flag was displayed in front of Bovard Auditorium in 1994 for National Coming Out Week. USC Lambda Alumni Association announced that they would offer a scholarship to openly gay, lesbian or bixsexual graduate or undergraduate students in the fall of the same year. 
Mark DeAngelis was elected as the first openly gay president of the student body at the Marshall School of Business. In 2000, a letter from former USC President Steven Sample titled “Speak Out Against Bigotry and Hatred” was published in the Daily Trojan. It was published as a letter and discussed acceptance for LGBT students. 
The Rainbow Floor, a special interest residential space for LGBTQ+ students, was established in Webb Tower in 2001. The Office for Residential Education provides community programming that allows members to learn about their LGBTQ+ identities. 
The year 2003 bore witness to the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Student Assembly (formerly GLSU) staging a mock gay marriage at Tommy Trojan with 200 guests. 
Lastly, the GLBTA changed their name to the Queer and Ally Student Assembly in 2010. USG passed gender-neutral housing options in 2014 and in 2017 the second-floor restroom in the Student Union became the first gender-neutral restroom on campus. 
The 1990s: Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work
Just as L.A. was rocked by the Northridge earthquake in 1994, Jennifer Van Loy, Debbie Osaki and Lisa Bove were attending USC as graduate students at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.
Both Van Loy and Osaki are members of the LGBTQ+ community who identify as lesbians. While the pair never met during their time at USC, they both felt safe being out in the school. 
“I did not experience stigma there, I felt safe being myself,” Van Loy said. “We’re not the kind of people who go around being really obviously out and talking about it all the time and in your face political about it.” 
Five years before Bove attended USC, she practiced as an ordained minister in the West Hollywood Presbyterian Church. The church was an LGBTQ+-friendly parrish in a largely unaccepting religion at the time, and Bove served as the pastor for the AIDS ministry from 1988-93. 
“Part of the why I chose to get a master’s in social work is I realized after five years or more of fighting with the Presbyterians it was [clear] they weren’t going to become open for a long time,” Bove said. “In fact, they didn’t become open until 2012. I decided I needed to have a career I could make money at.” 
The education at the time amazed Bove. She felt grateful to learn in an open, discrimination-free environment, but USC was far from perfect in regards to celebrating inclusivity. 
“I didn’t feel like the School of Social Work or USC wasn’t a bastion of ‘Oh my god, yes, queer, trans [celebration],’” Bove said. “But it was open, and there was no discrimination so for me that was a huge liberation to be in a place where there wan’t automatically discrimination.”
Learning about relevant social topics and discussing the ways to help society by means of social work led all three women to enjoy their experiences in the graduate program. 
Bove remembers most of the professors being white, with possibly one Latinx female professor and one Black male professor. As far as she can remember, they all identifed as cisgender. 
“During that time I probably did notice a few little things that I thought they should have been more progressive about,” Bove said. “It probably had to do with AIDS because that was the world I came from. I know there was one guy in our class with AIDS or HIV, depending on when it was talked about, but I think they didn’t do much about it. They could have been more progressive about that.” 
One clear memory Bove laughs about often with her best friend, even to this day, happened in one of her classes when one girl shared her engagement story. 
“During one of the classes one of the kind of popular straight girls had gotten engaged over the weekend,” Bove said. “The class stopped. She started telling about the romantic amazing gesture her fiance did and the class was riveted, including the professor.” 
Bove and her friend, who is also gay, sat back in amazement and laughed while 15 minutes of class time were taken up.
“Everything stopped to listen to this great straight romantic engagement,” Bove said. “It was sort of this example to us of, ‘Oh, well, we’re still way in the minority here.’ The whole [education] was geared towards heterosexual life and then gays and lesbians were brought in from time to time.” 
Throughout her time in higher education, Bove and her group of friends used their power as a community to use gay couples as examples in the class. 
“At the beginning I felt this great liberation and diversity because compared to the church it was pretty diverse,” Bove said. “Then as you get into it, you’re like ‘Well, it’s still kind of this old thinking in some ways.’”
Religion and LGBTQ+ Community
While attending USC, Bove did not completely give up preaching. She spent her time working in the United University Church. 
The church is a staple campus building with its slightly dilapidated, faded red brick and ivy growing up the sides. Bove spent 15 hours a week doing a few things for the church. 
Bove remembers leading a group and assisting with worship during her time. Unlike many graduate students in the masters of social work program, Bove did spend some time with undergraduate students.
After a short period at USC, Bove noticed a large difference in excitement toward academia. She loved the conversations the students and professors were having about relevant and current events and the general open mindedness of the school. 
The decision to leave her church in West Hollywood percolated over time after push back from the community. Bove was associate pastor to an openly gay man, and at the time, the two were involved in the larger Presbyterian community. 
“They were terrible … they were very anti-gay,” Bove said. “We would go to these meetings and hear terrible things. We were constantly trying to change the church and bring it up to the modern world.” 
The struggle against anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric within the church continued for five years which pushed Bove to pursue her master’s degree. 
“There was a constant threat in the church world that you could lose your ordination … they could take away all your rights or bring judicial charges against you,” Bove said. “It was kind of this constant fighting with people who weren’t open to gay and lesbian people.” 
Where are they now?
Bove has since returned to the same church in West Hollywood as a leader after having children. 
“When I had kids, I wanted them to be in a gay suppportive church,” Bove said. “There are not tons [of them].” 
The best part of Bove’s degree is that it allows her to work in many different areas. She started off working in child welfare and at the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services. Throughout her career she’s worked with abused neglected children and children with leukemia and lymphoma at a children’s hospital. Working at the children’s hospital led her to where she is now: a medical social worker. 
As for Osaki and Van Loy, the two met on a job at DCFS, and the rest was history. They have two children together and have been married since October 2008.
Osaki is now a therapist at Kaiser who works primarily with adults and some children who have depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. She also works with transgender individuals to help them start to transition medically. 
For four years, Van Loy has been a clinical supervisor to supervise therapists that primarily work with children. 
Bove, Osaki and Van Loy have all maintained a friendship since attending USC. The families go camping together and their children are friends.
Osaki and Van Loy’s daughter, Lindsey, appreciates the welcoming and kind familial environment her moms have created. 
“I think my favorite part about them is they’re very accepting of different people,” she said. “I’ve never felt like I had to hide things from them … they’ve kind of always helped me be very accepting of other people too.”

Catching up with her friend in a coffee shop in As-Suwayda, Syria during an early 1990s summer, then-graduate student Sarah Gualtieri overheard a language she was surprised to hear in the region: Spanish. Thinking that the Spanish speakers were tourists and voicing her thoughts to her friend, Gualtieri was corrected that the “tourists” were in fact Syrians visiting from Venezuela for the season. 
Since then, Gualtieri’s interest in the study of Syrian migration, particularly in connection to Latin America, has only grown. 
Her book “Arab Routes: Pathways to Syrians in California,” which explores the growth of the Syrian American community in Southern California and of Syrians who principally migrated from Latin America, was recently awarded the 2020 Alixa Naff Book Prize in Migration Studies in November. Gualtieri, chair of the Middle East studies department and recently promoted to full professor in American studies and ethnicity, history and Middle East studies, has also explored racial formation and the problematic classification of Arabs in the United States in her book “Between Arab and White: Race and Ethnicity in the Early Syrian American Diaspora.” 
“Arab Routes,” based on personal interviews and archives shared by families Gualtieri interviewed, also looks to unpack and shift the narrative of what it means to be Arab American.
“A lot of the way in which stories of Arab Americans are told is very standard, ‘Well, they came, like so many other immigrants did, to Ellis Island, they congregated in New York and they spread out to other areas, principally in the East Coast and Midwest,’” Gualtieri said. “All that is true, but I really think it’s important for this narrative to also shift out of that location … and to the West Coast to a site I call the Syrian Pacific.”
While attending the University of Chicago for graduate school where she studied Middle East studies followed by Middle East history, Gualtieri’s initial intention was to research and write about the Palestinian women’s movement. She based her master’s thesis on the forms of activism within the movement, particularly with a focus on activism within Chicago, and later began to wonder about other directions she could take her research. 
Taking graduate seminars and courses in Latin American and African American studies and reading works by James Baldwin including his essay “On Being White and Other Lies,” Gualtieri said the classes encouraged her to ask questions about racialization and power — material often overlooked in her Middle East history classes. 
“James Baldwin writes about whiteness as [being a lie] — that immigrants come to the United States and [they] have to really learn about the power of whiteness — why it matters so much, and the way in which it structures hierarchies and systems of oppression, and immigrants have accommodated [that system] and I began to see the ways in which Arab immigrants [in the early 20th century] … pivoted toward whiteness, claimed whiteness and wanted the privileges that whiteness conferred: the right to vote, the right to own property — they wanted those privileges. And at times, they resisted the claims to whiteness.” 
Interested in exploring this tension and inspired by her engagement with scholars in the Latin American and African American studies departments, Gualtieri wrote her dissertation, which would eventually become her first book: “Between Arab and White.” Based on tracking the “process of racialization of Arab immigrants in the United States,” Gualtieri’s first work is what led to her gaining tenure.  
In 2010, a year following the publication of “Between Arab and White,” Gualtieri began a new research endeavor focused on oral histories for “Arab Routes.” Initially looking into the composition of the Syrian and Lebanese community in Los Angeles, Gualtieri’s research took a turning point following an interview with a mother in Brea, Calif. who recounted her parents’ migration journey. 
Migrating to L.A. in the early 20th century and later residing in Boyle Heights, the mother recalled a woman that her family referred to as a “mother’s helper” and with whom her Lebanese father often spoke Spanish. Understanding the father to speak Arabic, Gualtieri was surprised to learn that he spoke Spanish after living several years in Mexico, working alongside other Lebanese immigrants. 
“It came as a surprise to me,” Gualtieri said. “Researchers are always happy when they encounter dimensions of a project that are kind of unexpected and so that was really a moment where I thought, “Ah, I really have to think about this Syrian connection, this sort of … pathway to and from Mexico that Syrians in Los Angeles, had and, in many senses, still have.”
Along with collecting oral histories, Gualtieri engaged in archival work including repositories, naturalization and census records. However, Gualtieri’s research also included an intergenerational component through a concept she calls an “archival transaction.”
Whereas historians would typically request documents from archives that would be brought out in organized boxes, Gualtieri’s historical research would also involve the families — usually intergenerational — she interviewed in the archival process. Often she would leave with a box filled with letters, documents and photographs and visit again at a later date with more items awaiting her. 
“The archive was really co-constituted; it was brought into being through this interaction I had with my interlocutors,” Gualtieri said. “So I think that for me as a historian [it] was very moving and also exciting to think of the ways in which we can think of archives differently … We don’t have to just be constantly going to these big libraries of these already established repositories; there’s a way in which wecan be seeking out archival material in smaller places including people’s basements, or garages.”
However, her work also took her to exploring archives long left untouched. Visiting an Orthodox Church on Temple Street, Gualtieri connected with a member of the congregation who also served as the church’s librarian. She learned from the librarian that she was the first person to access these records for research, despite various community members visiting the church on a weekly basis. 
“I hope the work that I’m doing encourages, especially younger people, to speak to their elders, to ask them about their memories of migration because there will be a moment in which that’s no longer possible,” Gualtieri said. “I just remember that it’s been an experience where I felt very honored to be in that place, but also a little bit sad in the sense that I assumed that there would have been more use of the records.” 
While writing “Arab Routes,” Gualtieri said she looked to write in a more accessible tone where a “wider swath of readers” outside of academia — where academic prose is common in the profession — could approach and engage with her work. She also looked to “translate to the page” the intimacy she had with the families she interviewed and of the stories and memories — often painful — that they shared. 
Along with accessibility, Gualtieri also looked to capture a more personal register in “Arab Routes” to honor the moments that her interviewees shared with her, particularly Arab American women, and to let their stories frame the narrative of the book. 
Researchers and academics will often bring their own personal experiences into their work, Gualtieri said. Writing “Arab Routes,” she faced tremendous grief due to the loss of her partner  to cancer.  As a result, she was unsure whether she would be able to regain her writerly voice. However, vulnerable due to her own loss, Gualtieri said she ended up connecting with the stories of loss that interviewees narrated to her. 
One of the women interviewees, following the recent passing of her grandmother, shared with Gualtieri her personal journey to understand her Arabness. Born in the United States and growing up not speaking Arabic, the women looked to learn more about her family history during this time of mourning. 
“[The women interviewee] began to explore that dimension, actually gave herself permission to explore that dimension of her identity,” Gualtieri said. “I really connected with her about how mourning, loss and grief […] I opened up in [new] ways to interpret stories of migration.”
In February, Gualtieri held a talk in Doheny Memorial Library on “Arab Routes,” three months after the publication of her book. Scheduled for another talk at Rice University in early March, Gualtieri made the last minute decision to cancel the event as the coronavirus pandemic continued to spread nationwide. 
Several months later, Gualtieri said she never would have imagined the state of restricted travel currently in place and where, instead of attending in-person seminars, she would be giving talks remotely to individuals from various parts of the globe. 
“I really miss the dynamic of looking out and seeing people in the audience. Seeing the way they move as they listen to a talk,” Gualtieri said. “As a whole, I would say that the pandemic has really had the effect of shutting me off from the communities that I typically interact with, [with] regard to my research.”
Evelyn Alsultany, associate professor of American studies and ethnicity, remembers the first time she heard about Gualtieri was while attending the Middle East Studies Association Conference in 2002. A graduate student at the time with an interest in understanding Arab Americans in relation to U.S. racial politics, Alsultany attended Gualtieri’s talk looking at the question of whether Arab Americans should be defined as white. This was the first of the association’s talks that involved conversations about Arab Americans and race, Alsultany said. 
As a colleague who read the first chapter of “Arab Routes” before publication, Alsultany said she looks forward to the impact Gualtieri’s works will make in the field of Arab American studies. 
“It’s really exciting that she is helping us understand who Arab Americans are, in these new ways,” Alsultany said. “I have no doubt that in time it will also have a huge impact in the field and how we approach our research and think about Arab Americans.”
Throughout the pandemic, Gualtieri’s “Arab Routes” has received widespread recognition, both on social media and through her recent Alixa Naft award.  
Karen Tongson, a professor of english, gender and sexuality studies, and American studies and ethnicity, congratulated Gualtieri on her promotion to full professor and recent award. Both started as professors at USC in Fall 2005, attending all the new faculty events together and staying friends ever since. Tongson said she’s delighted that Gualtieri was able to honor her book’s “intellectual and personal vision” while working as a professor and during their extensive service hours on USC committees. 
“It’s gratifying all around to hear how much praise she’s been receiving for that book, how well received it’s been by scholars in her field and also really glad that it’s receiving the [accolades] that it deserves in this context,” Tongson said. “I couldn’t be more excited for her, that she could achieve that link.” 
As someone “notoriously shy on social media” and who only created a Twitter account following her publisher’s recommendation, Gualtieri said she’s enjoyed seeing various users interact with “Arab Routes,” even with her limited activity. 
“I’ve seen younger scholars refer to the book and the way it’s opened up new horizons for them in terms of thinking about inter American migration and [about] racial liminality. And I think that’s what someone in my position loves to see is that scholars engage with [my] work and often find ways of describing it [with] a meaning that I had not even seen at first.” 
Surprised at being named as one of the recipients for the Alixa Naff Prize, Gualtieri said the news felt affirming and that she was honored to receive the accolade, which was named after an influential scholar in the field of Arab American Studies. 
“The Mother of Arab American Studies” and daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Alixa Naff is known for driving  across the United States and eastern Canada in her beaten up Volkswagen Beetle in the early 1960s, interviewing and documenting the stories of more than 80 Arab immigrant elders. Collecting newspapers, photographs and recordings, Naff established the Faris and Yamna Naff Arab American Collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. to preserve the stories of Arabic-speaking immigrants. 
“I like the fact that my book has gotten an award that’s named after her,” Gualtieri said. “It’s a way for me to feel connected to this really innovative kind of iconoclastic work that she did so many years ago.”
Reflecting on her recent promotion to full professor — following years in higher education as a tenure track to later tenured professor — Gualtieri said she remembers being inspired by her professional mentors to follow the route of an engaged activist scholar. Having worked on several search committees for departmental hirings, she also believes she was lucky in gaining a job as a young scholar.
Although currently facing a challenging balance of staying at home, parenting her child, teaching and completing administrative tasks as a department chair, Gualtieri continues to engage in archival work and looks to embark on a personal project to understand her family’s connection to the Palestinian solidarity movement.

A lot has happened since the last time I wrote this column. We have a new president, countries around the world began vaccinations against coronavirus and a new semester of school started. If this column was about anything other than esports, I wouldn’t have a hard time deciding what to write about. 
Thankfully, one piece of media has dominated the discussion in the gaming sphere over the past few months. Of course, I am talking about Cyberpunk 2077. 
For those of you not familiar with what I am talking about, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game created by CD Projekt Red, a video game developing company. Inspired by a board game, the game promised a sci-fi open-world filled with realistic artificial intelligence, as well as extensive character customization seldom seen in any other role-playing games. They even had actor Keanu Reeves take part in the project. Naturally, all those things led to the game garnering insane levels of hype. 
It did not take a genius to guess that the game would never be able to live up to its reputation, especially after its various delays. But few thought it would be the disaster that it has become. 
Not only did the game not deliver on various promises, but it was also riddled with glitches and bugs, being declared almost unplayable on consoles after its launch. The issue was so prominent that Sony pulled the game from its digital store and offered refunds. Microsoft soon followed suit. 
In the months since Cyberpunk 2077 was released, gamers have gained more insight into what was going on behind the scenes as the game was being made. Mainly, a divide between the developers, lead executives and the marketing team as to how polished the game actually was. 
In other words, it is a classic cautionary tale against marketing and corporate expectations in video games.
And while Cyberpunk 2077 is far from being the first overhyped game in history, it is perhaps one of the first AAA titles that consistently accumulated hype throughout almost a decade. This means that an accomplished marketing team consistently lied to the public, forcing an entire studio to spend 10 years overworking and sacrificing their health at the risk of losing their jobs. 
But what does this have to do with esports?
Anyone familiar with the video game scene knows the importance of marketing for the survival of esports. Most of the time, players and organizations make a profit thanks to sponsorship and marketing deals, be they for individuals, entire teams or tournaments.  
However, the recent failure of Cyberpunk 2077 shows us how that business model might be unstable, leading to more harm than good. 
Let me explain. Unlike CD Projekt Red, esports athletes and organizations do not produce any new games. As such, they are not at the risk of having to do overtime to fill in the shoes set by the marketing team. However, they are at the hands of their sponsors and investors who, much like the marketing team behind Cyberpunk 2077, are often only looking at the numbers and a return on their investment. This means that human elements have the risk of being ignored in favor of profit. 
In a very simple example, the Vancouver Titans, a team focused on the game Overwatch, dropped its entire roster earlier this year due to coronavirus relocations. Instead of adapting the format to better fit the players’ needs, the companies retained their expectations, forcing teams to take drastic actions to protect their livelihoods. 
These decisions happen behind closed doors, and it takes a massive failure like Cyberpunk 2077 for them to be addressed. But it is not as if they don’t happen. And taking into account how the predominant business model in the industry quite literally gives the sponsors all the power in discussions, it would be foolish to think that it won’t continue. 
As such, the only possible way to avoid such manipulation is to change the business model, even if only partially. 
I don’t pretend to have all the answers. After all, I am not in the industry myself. Maybe some obstacles are only visible once you enter the professional world. But as of right now, it’s clear to me that teams must search for some autonomy from sponsors. And funny enough, I believe the answer is in how small tournaments and athletes make a profit: creating a connection with the community.
If small tournaments thrive by creating an environment where anyone can feel at ease, as I explored in one of my previous columns, who says that esports teams can’t do the same? They could, for example, hold their competitions where people of all skill levels could try for a small cash prize. To attract those of a higher skill level, the teams could host tournaments where the top five players would enter a training camp held by the team to help polish their abilities. 
As I said before, this is far from an exhaustive list of definite answers. But with the start of the new year, it is high time we in the gaming community reflect on our mistakes and work towards stopping similar things from happening again. The story of Cyberpunk 2077 may have been a great cautionary tale for the gaming sphere as a whole, but if we continue to encourage the same habits that led to this disaster, it will certainly not be the last.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team split the difference on the road in the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament at UC Berkeley. With one win and one loss against both No. 5 Cal and No. 3 UCLA, the Trojans had their first taste of the uphill battle to a MPSF Championship title. 
This weekend was the first of three round-robin tournaments that will comprise the participating teams’ seasons while limiting play to games within the Pac-12 only. Despite not playing Stanford, who is tied with USC at No. 1, the Trojans still faced fierce competition as they hoped to improve on their third-place finish in last year’s MPSF tournament.
Without three of the USC’s best offensive weapons and junior drivers, including Hannes Daube, redshirt Marko Vavic and transfer Ashworth Molthen — who is playing overseas to prepare for the Olympics — it was time for the squad’s veterans and newcomers to stand up. 
And stand up they did, with personal records achieved and multiple exceptional debuts.
Competition started bright and early Saturday morning against the Bears, with the Trojans securing a 4-1 lead in the second quarter with help from junior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt, senior driver Jacob Mercep, sophomore driver Marcus Longton and newcomer freshman driver Carson Kranz. USC never gave up their lead, scoring four more in the second half and raking up a .600 shooting percentage for a 9-6 finish against Cal.
Head coach Marko Pintaric noticed the efforts of the players, especially the youngest and newest, stepping up early on and contributing to the Trojan’s offensive drives.
“Carson is a freshman, did a phenomenal job for us, and we already knew that he would play a significant role this season,” Pintaric said. “As a true freshman, he put himself in four games against the top-five ranked opponents [and he held] his ground and [contributed] immediately.”
Saturday’s matchup with UCLA, the second of the day, saw both teams bringing their best offensive efforts to the table, with the Trojans and Bruins each getting perfect shooting percentages. USC edged ahead by capitalizing on 4-5 power plays compared to the Bruins’ .333 conversion percentage, along with making 2-5 penalty shots and allowing none from UCLA. 
Senior 2-meter Wyatt Barker and Kranz showed up again with two and one goals, respectively. In the second quarter, Ehrhardt sent two to the back of the net to gain back control for the Trojans after the Bruins’ jumped out to an early 2-0 lead. Mercep delivered a career-high seven goals to get USC up to 12-7 final score, becoming the 
No. 25 all-time Trojan career scorer with 123 goals in less than three years.
The second day of competition showed the inevitable signs of early-season fatigue, exacerbated by the Trojans only having 10 of their usual 14-player traveling team in attendance due to contact tracing and quarantine restrictions. 
Cal was on the scoreboard quickly Sunday morning with four goals in the first quarter along with two 5-meter penalty shots. Both teams had their chances to score throughout the contest, with USC attempting 30 shots and Berkeley putting up 36. The activity in front of net forced junior goalie Nic Porter to match a career-high 20 saves during the game. Despite USC’s more favorable 0.538 6-on-5 conversion rate, they didn’t earn a chance for penalty shots and couldn’t lock in their defensive effort to answer Cal’s scoring runs that gave the Bears the win, 12-9.
UCLA didn’t let USC’s scoring drives slow down their pace in the last game of the weekend. After the first period ended in a 4-3 Trojan lead, UCLA secured a lasting lead with three straight goals from the field and three 5-meter penalty shots. Kranz and Longton closed the point gap to one goal with help from freshman 2-meter Max Miller and Barker, but UCLA held it down with nine in the first half and two to close the game out, 11-8. 
The coaching staff and the players reviewed the games and are focusing on improving a consistent defensive effort, a principle that has been the thread through the squad at its best, national-title-winning heights.
“We did have a really bad defensive day as a team,” Pintaric said. “We knew what Cal was going to do, considering the way they played us first day … But then again, water polo is a game of inches, and we give up way too many goals, way too many chances, shots in frame — and this is not the way USC plays defense.”
All three teams at the tournament ended the weekend 2-2, illustrating the difficulty of a season-opener after months of adjusted practices and no play. Pintaric credited the tenacity of the players and the expertise of the athletic training staff to get the squad in the best shape possible without overworking them. 
“[It] was to go in cycles to condition players to keep them safe,” Pintaric said. “That was the number one thing; closely monitor our student-athletes, so we bring a physical form to a point that’s set to compete.” 
The second round-robin weekend tournament will be hosted by USC on Feb. 6-7. Competitors and matchups have yet to be determined.

Adapted from a stage play of the same name, “One Night in Miami” reexamines the relationship between four influential men and how a single night’s discussion could make a lasting impact on the world.
The film follows a fictionalized conversation between Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Cassius Clay — who later changed his name to Muhammad Ali — on the night that Clay wins his first world heavyweight championship. 
Expecting a post-fight celebration, they instead discuss the responsibilities that come with being prominent, successful Black men during the Civil Rights movement. An intense debate ensues regarding the most effective way to use their respective platforms in the fight for liberation and whether what they’re doing is enough.
On Monday night, American Cinematheque hosted a virtual Q&A with “One Night in Miami” stars Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, Kingsley Ben-Adir and writer Kemp Powers. They discussed how director Regina King left her unique mark on the film and what it was like for each of the actors to embody such iconic historical figures. 
Praising King in her directorial debut, Powers discussed how although screenwriters are usually removed from the production process, King convinced him to stay attached. 
“I was just trying to answer as many of Regina’s questions as possible hoping that she would come on and direct this film and she was the one who was just like ‘Yeah, I want you to stay involved and be a part of this process,’” Powers said. “She told me that the story resonated to her so strongly because it made her think of so many of the Black men in her life. Her son, her uncles, her father — and that was really powerful.”
Although King is an acclaimed actress, this was her first time directing a feature film. Having only previously dabbled in TV directing, this film presented her with a unique challenge since the majority of it takes place in one room. However, King rose to the occasion, with Oscar buzz already predicting that she will gain a “Best Director” nomination. 
If King wins the award, she will be only the second woman in history to receive the honor, but Powers said that it is precisely her gender that made this film work. 
“I think that this is a very testosterone-filled story and I think it gets balanced and it gets improved by having a Black woman at the helm as the captain of the ship — and that’s exactly what she was,” Powers said.  “I think the end result just wouldn’t be what it is if not for Regina’s really deft hand.” 
Rotten Tomatoes film critic Jacqueline Coley moderated the discussion and commented on the historic and profound impact that King’s success has on how the film industry sees the merit of the female perspective. 
“This film especially proves that female filmmaking does not necessarily always mean putting women as the subject,” Coley said. “It means the female gaze and I think she really exemplifies how the female gaze of filmmaking is remarkable.”  
The four lead actors underwent the monumental task of portraying famous figures each with recognizable mannerisms and dialects. Wanting to do these men justice, they each spent months preparing every detail of their characters.
Eli Goree plays Clay as he wins his first world championship and prepares to convert to Islam. Goree was dedicated to playing this icon perfectly, obsessing over the way he said each word. 
“There is a part where I am looking in the mirror and I say ‘heavyweight champ of the whole world’ and it kept not sounding right, it didn’t sound like him,” Goree said. “It was bothering me and I’d call up my dialect coach and just say champ like 5,000 times on the phone.” 
“Hamilton” breakout star Leslie Odom Jr. not only played the role of famous soul singer Sam Cooke but recorded all-original vocals for the film as well. Cooke’s voice defined a generation of soul music and is instantly recognizable to many fans. Rather than attempting to imitate his voice, Odom Jr. tried to psychologically understand Cooke’s choices about things such as where to take a breath and where not to in order to capture the essence of the song.
Luckily Odom Jr. is a lifelong fan of Cooke and already learned a lot from listening to him. “Singing is an oral tradition and so Sam has been one of my teachers, one of my mentors, for most of my life but I never crawled inside the recordings in the way that I did for this film,” Odom Jr. said. 
The preparation for Ben-Adir’s Malcolm X and Aldis Hodge’s Jim Brown were equally as profound. Ben-Adir tapped into the lesser known personal side of Malcolm, showing him as a man with flaws and struggles as contrasted to the self-assured leader he was in public. 
Hodge’s Brown set the film into motion with a powerful opening scene where he is praised and complemented by a white man in his Georgia hometown, then refused entry to his house due to his race.
Together, these talented men formed an ensemble that accomplished their goal of doing justice to some of the most famous figures in American history. 
“This is not a biopic about any one of these men individually, it’s about a conversation, it is about a relationship,” Hodge said.

At some point or another during the week, I check my email. Instead of the job offers I so desperately need, the Medium Daily Digest waits patiently in my inbox, ready for a quick scroll-through. Under “today’s highlights” is a top story that the algorithm decided I should read: “The Horrifying Murder of Marion Parker.” 
During the weekend, it’s nice to take a load off and catch up on some TV. Sitting in the top-10 U.S. watching rankings this past weekend was “Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer.” 
Jesus, well, how about Twitter? I thank God and Jack Dorsey every day for blessing us with the merciless repetition of whatever “discourse” seems to be on people’s minds that day. This weekend was “women — get a gun.”
I thought this was a line either by the NRA, The Well Armed Woman publication or even from the writers of “Stay Sexy & Don’t Get Murdered: The Definitive How-To Guide” (yes, you might remember Karen and Georgia from their true crime podcast, “My Favorite Murder”).
The deluge of true crime media comes as well-timed as a manifestation. A lot of the marketing to engage with the content, either emphasizing female hosts or inviting you to grab a glass of wine while you listen, is geared toward women. This is unsurprising after Kelli Boling and Kevin Hull of the University of South Carolina found that in 2018, 73% of the audience of true crime podcasts, perhaps the genre’s medium soulmate, are women. 
While being ingested, with hands clutching a blanket and eyes darting around the room, true crime media can start to feel like an addiction. Horror researcher Mathias Clasen argues that the need to feed this fascination can come from dealing with trauma and facing a fear in a safe environment, hell, some survivors of the crimes the genre covers return to it, but is true crime made to accommodate those needs?
“Night Stalker” is the perfect case: I didn’t want to watch the show, but for the column I thought it would help situate my thoughts. I didn’t need to watch more than five seconds to support my argument. 
Instead of a trigger, content or graphic violence warning, “Night Stalker” tries to hook its teeth into you with an old ’80s VCR tape from none other than the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Homicide detective Gil Carrillo, seemingly without interest, recites a warning about a series of home invasions-turned-sexual assaults and murders. He goes into more detail than necessary about how the perpetrator is maiming or killing his victims, but that’s what the people want isn’t it?
The sound of his voice sharpens into the tone of an unrelenting, callous intrusive thought. The video pushes in on his gaze, as if we were supposed to see some hope of humanity in his eyes. 
This is where the imagination comes into conflict with real life. “Night Stalker” goes on to inundate you with crime scene photos, the most graphic I’ve ever seen in a show like this. The detectives and police reviewing the case with evidence or memory at best seem haunted, and at worst, disaffected. The crimes they review tug at the sanctity of your stomach, and a wince rests on your face as the details drag on through as it pleases. 
Either the episode ends or your laptop is slammed shut, and you’re back in your room. While it is very likely that the depiction of Richard Ramirez’s terror tour across California will stay with you through the night, you might feel placated by one of Clasen’s inferences to why you watched. You’re safe, and Karen and Georgia are proud. 
But are you safe? It depends on who you are or what you do. 
Between 1970 and 2009, 22% of confirmed victims of serial killers in the United States were sex workers. In the 2010s, it was 43%. Sex workers make up 0.3% of the population, and take up an enormous part of police indifference and disdain. 
Marginalized groups are also overrepresented in serial killer-victim statistics and case ignorance. Around 13% of the U.S. population is Black, 17% is Latinx, and respectively they comprise 24% and 7% of these victims. In 2019, the Dallas Police Department declined to entertain the LGBTQ+ community’s real fear of a serial killer after the murders of five Black trans women in four years, even while asking the FBI for assistance on the cases. 
The point is, true crime as a whole, as a genre, as an exponentially expanding content industry, has not addressed these points. The stories are generally about white, middle-class women, chosen for the percepted “innocence” and because many true crime media creators are of this socioeconomic status. 
It’s not a representation issue in the way we come to discuss other forms of media. These are real stories of violence, some of which are passed off as parts of a whole because their race, their gender, their orientation are viewed as “others” in a genre about … the most horrific experiences somes humans have ever experienced or witnessed.
It’s also not a solution to say that flooding the already saturated true crime market with specific-to-underrepresented-groups cases will fix this disparity. True crime leans on the accounts of the police and the otherwise apathetic public to push their gore to astounding heights of capital. It needs to hold these same groups accountable for the people they have left and continue to leave behind.

After writing for the Daily Trojan for the past two years, my first editorial remains perhaps my most controversial piece. 
Written in light of Undergraduate Student Government’s announcement of free HIV testing for USC students, the editorial argued that while free HIV testing was a progressive step in the right direction, comprehensive STI testing should be the ultimate goal. On a campus that encourages safe sex practices, it seemed almost contradictory that students still paid out of pocket for routine STI screenings that most health insurance companies do not cover. 
It incited debate on Facebook. I was scrolling through my own feed to stumble upon USC alumni arguing with USC students over the validity of my argument: Does a university really owe its students free STI testing? Of course, these counter arguments were in the same vein as anti-universal health care positions. Where will this money come from? I shouldn’t have to pay for other people to receive health care! I even received an email from a university health center clinician, imploring me to “dig deeper” and “ask more than state an opinion.” 
First and foremost, I stand by my original argument — STI testing remains inaccessible especially to sexual minorities, or people who identify as LGBTQ+. The stigma that accompanies STIs prevents people from receiving the proper treatment, which correlates with several socio-economic trends that demonstrate how LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to lack access to healthcare — especially LGBTQ+ people of color. 
Similarly, sexual minorities encounter a stigma both outside and within their communities. HIV-positive people still experience discrimination, which is exacerbated by misinformation and miseducation. Transgender athletes’ existence remains controversial and plagued by trans-exclusionary radical feminists, also known as TERFs, who want equality for women in sports — but only cisgender women. Ultimately, we must be able to talk about sexual minority stigma in order to address the inequities prompted by it. 
According to a study conducted by the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Davis, sexual minority stigma subjects LGBTQ+ members to “explicit or subtle discrimination, to be marginalized or made virtually invisible by many of society’s institutions, and often vilified.” Society perpetuates this prejudice through the belief that homosexuality is invalid compared to heterosexuality, otherwise known as “heterosexism.” This ideology can be internalized by sexual minorities, who can easily succumb to the negative beliefs held by the majority. We see this same sociological phenomenon with internalized misogyny, internalized racism and any other prejudice that marginalizes a distinct community. 
In fact, another study conducted by the Southern Gerontological Society concluded that sexual minority stigma in healthcare settings — enacted by healthcare providers and internalized by patients — is correlated to higher sexual risk behaviors in HIV-positive gay and bisexual men. The study also found that sexual minority stigma correlated to infrequent healthcare utilization and amplified stress levels in gay and bisexual men, which indicates a lack of willingness to seek routine sexual health testing. 
Ultimately, this study justifies how sexual minority and HIV stigma endangers the health of sexual minorities because partaking in more sexual risk behaviors, not seeking appropriate healthcare services and not receiving appropriate healthcare services heighten their risk of contracting STIs. 
People still insist that sexual minority stigma disappeared when gay marriage was legalized in the United States. Yet we have a newly appointed supreme court justice who framed sexuality as a “preference” in her confirmation hearings, and the official GOP platform still condemns same-sex marriage. 
Furthermore, we consistently subvert transgender people in these conversations. In an op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal, writer Abigail Shrier asserts that President Joe Biden’s executive order to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation “rigs competition by requiring biological boys be allowed to compete against girls.” 
I have several problems with this article, but my main takeaway is that not allowing transgender students to compete with their gender is transphobic. Cisgender women are not being cheated. Transgender athletes do not endure sexual minority stigma and subject themselves to systemic violence to simply win a medal. 
This same transphobic argument about trans women having an unfair hormone advantage is arbitrary; some people, including cis women, naturally have more testosterone levels. According to Dr. Joshua Safer, Executive Director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, “A person’s sex is made up of multiple biological characteristics and they may not all align as typically male or female in a given person…Further, many people who are not trans can have hormones levels outside of the range considered typical of a cis person of their assigned sex.” I ask writers to take one gender studies course before they publish transphobic material that disregards the sex and gender spectrum. 
To diminish this stigma, it is imperative to open the conversation about enacted and internalized sexual minority stigma when discussing any LGBTQ+ related issues. For example, while discussing STI statuses, some people refer to themselves as “clean” when they’re STI negative. When I try to discuss the problem with this, I have been called the “politically correct police.” To be clear, correlating an HIV-negative status to “clean” insinuates that being HIV-positive is “dirty,” thus ostracizing people with an HIV-positive status. 
Ultimately, the sexual minority stigma will continue to spread misinformation and wreak havoc if we do not confront it. As an openly bisexual man, these issues strike a chord with me, and I will strive to educate others and instigate civil discourse in the hopes of expanding health care access and advocating for marginalized groups. In the end, I am simply asking for justice.

It is undeniable that the political merchandise wars have permeated daily life. Beginning as simple spectacles of support, these lawn sign clashes have now escalated; a college student in Washington, DC was beaten at a feminist protest for waving a Trump flag. Yet, why do so many still insist on wearing the infamous red cap, or a pro-choice T-shirt, on college campuses and places where they may perhaps not be accepted?
Many would argue that the choice to wear merchandise is to portray personal values. Prabal Gurung, the American fashion designer who recently dressed Kamala Harris, argued this in the Seattle Times, suggesting that “clothing is our language and our medium for communication.” He points towards his emblazoned “Give a damn” leather tote — these are not polarizing political pieces but an overt expression of the bearer’s values.
Therefore, someone who wears a pro-choice tee on campus is just portraying their faith in freedom of choice, right? Arguably yes, but this line of reasoning becomes blurred when applied to political issues. 
Unfortunately, much of today’s political parties have evolved to represent policies that are directly contradictory to the moral compass of the other side. Rather than serving to represent what the wearer believes in, political merchandise tends to offend those who don’t believe likewise.  
Hence, political merchandise has perhaps become even more powerful than simple depictions of values, as it now represents the uniform of a tribe. Arguably, the Trump flags don’t portray any particular value or belief. Beyond the inconsistencies of his own convictions (in 1999, he declared he was pro-choice, he is now pro-life), his followers are from all walks of life and can believe in any one of his policies. Flying a Trump flag is essentially meaningless in terms of specific values — the owner’s social beliefs could be anything under the right-wing umbrella.  
Thus, rather than the moral convictions, the true reason someone would wear the MAGA with pride is to simply declare themselves a Trump supporter, feeding into the “Cosa Nostra’’ rhetoric of the Trump administration and dividing a nation.
This is not just limited to the Trump tribe. The Biden-Harris merchandise became popular in response to the proliferation of MAGA wares. The most genius of their stock was purely reactive to viral moments of Trump history. Let’s take a look at two favorites — the “Will you shut up, man?” shirts that are essentially time machines to the most interesting, yet chaotic, presidential debate in history, and, of course, the legendary “Truth over Flies” fly swatters. These don’t show any particular values. The Democrats parade this clothing in solidarity for their party, for the tribe to which they belong.
Some may say that wearing tribe colors stems from wanting to represent the values of that political party. Yet, why is the merchandise branded with the divisive “Liberal Privilege,” and not the more accurate policy perspective, “Lower taxation for a better nation?” According to the University of Wisconsin Professor Katherine Cramer, these are needlessly alienating statements that have no policy grounding. They fuel the politics of resentment. 
Moreover, this kind of extreme worship-like support given off by political merchandise is unique to the United States. Elsewhere around the world, it is less common to find individuals portraying their political partisanship in the clothes they wear. It would be bizarre to see an Englishman who supports his prime minister flaunting his support with teacups printed with BoJo’s unique strains of ‘Bushisms’ or a Frenchman who totters around with a beret adorned with Macron’s face. Given the high comedic standards of their current merchandise, it would not take much for the highly paid US presidential campaigns to think of less polarising methods to show support.
This is not to say, however, that all political clothing is evil. From the Gilet Jaunes to the red capes of the Handmaid, protest dressing has shaken beliefs and provoked revolution. Thus, it is not the clothing itself that is harmful. It is the brash misguided messages of the clothing that fails to represent the true values of the wearer. They act as badges of identity, stoking division. Political attire needs to be badges of thought.
In this day and age, it is imperative college campuses retain conversation. They ought to ensure that students are attuned to the other tribes and exit their echo chambers. USC should encourage students to wear political merchandise and show what they believe in. However, they should also ensure that it doesn’t have some lewd comment about Hillary Clinton and Monica Lewinsky or a snide reference to “Trussia.”
