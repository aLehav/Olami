Newly appointed Provost Michael Quick has taken on his appointment by preparing his vision for the upcoming term. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Quick explained how his vision for the university is directly affected by the voice of students and faculty on campus. He stressed the importance of voice and vision — how the two interrelate and how he plans to utilize student and faculty interaction to model various plans and initiatives for the future.
Daily Trojan: How have your other roles at USC prepared you for your role as provost?
Michael Quick: Lots of different roles, right? I was the head of neuroscience graduate program for a while so I started to learn how to work with faculty, work with students, stuff like that. Even before that I was a scientist head of lab, I learned how to manage a budget.  Everything you do in your life is going to train you for the next thing that you do.
Most recently, I was the executive vice provost, which is sort of the number two person in the provost office, and the really great thing — working with former provost Beth Garrett and working with our president — they allowed me to be a part of everything going on. So you sort of learn everything  from hiring faculty or working with other deans on other projects or creating new programs, or student affairs — all of those things just to be a part of it and seeing how other people do it, how other people manage things. Everything you do in life is going to impact you for things you do going forward.”
DT: What kind of specific policies or initiatives do you hope to work on within the next year?
MQ: Certainly in [my time as interim provost], you want to make sure you’re carrying out the vision of the president, etc. and that of course will continue going forward. To be honest, I like the timing of when I was appointed to this position because I think we’re going to really jump in and start working on stuff.
I think there are a number of the things we’ve been doing going forward — we’ve got the big rollout of the new general education program starting in fall, that’s going to be a big deal. We are starting to work on residential education, thinking about what it’s going to be like once we have USC Village in place and how we can enhance the real opportunities and interesting programs, especially at the undergraduate level. We’ve been working all along on these types of things and we are going to continue to do that.
I’m going to work over the next few months talking to students and talking to faculty to get their input on what they feel are critical issues that they think we should go forward with as a university, so that when we hit the fall; we come out really running with sort of a big vision. I have my own ideas of where this university should go, but the great thing about being at a university is the fact that you are surrounded by really smart people all the time … and I want to learn from them, whether that’s students or faculty. Then we’ll put together a real plan for the kinds of things we want to accomplish going forward. So that’s sort of how I’m thinking about the next few months.
DT: How do you plan to engage with students and faculty?
MQ: For engaging with students and faculty, I guess my style is a little bit informal. My guess would be that what I want to do is to get out, as I have been doing, and work with … for example, I want to work with the new Undergraduate Student Government, Rini [Sampath, USG president] and colleagues, and I want to talk to them. But, let’s just get out and talk informally with students [to see] what’s on their mind. Same thing with faculty.
Are there specific things? I don’t want to come out of the gate saying, “I know what’s right for the university.” I want to hear what we can do together. But, I think there’s some really big themes.
I think because there is always a lot of talk about affordability, I want to change that conversation to be about value. What kind of value do we want to deliver as a university? Both out in the world, to make the world a better place, but also, internally. How do we make sure that we are providing value to the career that you want to eventually have? What kind of experiences can we give you on campus that prepare you for that?
Another big issue for us as a university is this issue of access. I am so proud of what this university does in terms of access for underrepresented minorities, first-generation college goers, which I was one, the way we allow so many transfer students to come to this university. We do great stuff and we need to do more of that. So, that is going to be a big theme.
The last thing I would say is, we are a great big university, it’s true. We have everything from the arts, to the social sciences, to the natural sciences, to the clinics, so we should be taking on the big problems of the 21st century. And if we are not doing it, then we are not holding up our end of the bargain as a great private research university.
DT: How can we work to better improve undergraduate and graduate degree programs, and how can we allow the university to lead students to different career paths they may have not had interest in before studying here?
MQ: We are starting to do some new stuff, like with the new general education program, saying that particular classes can count towards the major because right now, in the GE program, they don’t. That allows students to think of their general education program, differently than they used to. We’ve created some really interesting programs like the Iovine Young program, the World Bachelor [in Business] program, so these sort of unique experiences for students. We still need to get better about allowing a lot of interdisciplinary kinds of programs to be put in place and knocking down the kind of bureaucracy around that, so students can try a lot of things.
One of the things that we have been getting ready to roll out, I know under the leadership of Dr. [Gene] Bickers in the undergraduate office, is a career pathway program, so that we can tie student’s academic interests to their long term plans. Of course, as you know, one’s plans, at least mine, changed every 10 minutes. To understand that change and guide students in ways that say, “If you’re really thinking about this kind of career, these are the kinds of academic programs you may want to be thinking about.”
DT: What is your biggest goal for next year?
MQ: We are going to have GE rolling out, we are going to be working on the residential education programs — that is going to be huge. We will do work with the new beds coming in at USC Village, with how we are converting things into what we are calling residential colleges.
I just charged a committee that is going to working on that. That has the opportunity to really transform this university. We are doing a lot of stuff outside of the classrooms, along with inside the classrooms. So that students coming in, will have the opportunity to be a part of a group that is interested in these kinds of things, so those ideas may change and they may do different things, but they will be part of intellectual communities — partly in the resident halls, partly in other things that they do, I think it moves us more towards the idea that we want personalized education.
I think there should be an educational revolution in that we go from what we currently do to personalized education. Every student is going to have the opportunity to have a particular experience sort of tailored for them ,and as we get more data about students and what their interest are, we will be able to craft that.

A USC alumnus is working to reinvent the alarm clock industry through Wakē, a device that provides an individualized wake up call that doesn’t disturb the whole room.
Will Russell, a 2010 graduate of the Viterbi School of  Engineering’s mechanical engineering master’s program,  sought to fix what he saw as a common flaw in alarm clocks — if the alarm goes off in a bedroom, everyone can hear it.
And not everyone is ready to get up.
Wakē (pronounced Wakey), however, seeks to combat this. The device works through a combination of sound and light.  It is mounted above the user’s bed and uses infrared temperature sensor and body-tracking software to find the person its mean to wake up.
Then, when it’s time to rouse the user, a tight burst of light is shot at them, as well as sound in a narrow wave from a parametric speaker. The latter function certifies that only the user who wants to wake up is affected by the sound.
The project is currently being funded by a Kickstarter campaign that was launched last Tuesday. As of Monday night, the product has reached nearly half of its $100,00 goal.
Russell and his team thought about the product 18 months ago and started ordering sensors and parts from SparkFun and DigiKey, two popular electronics retailers that manufactures and sells microcontroller development boards and breakout boards.
“Surprisingly, we got some good results with the IR sensor we found on DigiKey,” Russel said. “It was a matter of time before we found this parametric speaker technology.
Wakē’s Kickstarter, which is asking to fund “some expensive injection mold tooling and buy large batches of parts at affordable prices,” has until May 30 to reach its goal.
Though Russell has graduated and is busy with his product, he said he still he comes back to campus for special events, including career fairs and recruiting events. He also enjoyed his classes at Viterbi.
“I really enjoyed the class space exploration architectures by professor Madhu Thangavelu and spacecraft design with professor Gruntman,” Russell said. “I liked these classes because [they] offered so much variety and possibility.”
Russell advises current students to be entrepreneurs and find a new and innovative way to apply their engineering abilities.
“There is no better time to be an engineer,” Russell said. “There are so many opportunities now from low-cost sensors to the prototyping tools. Don’t feel that the engineering world is confined to your curriculum.’
Russell said applying knowledge learned in the classroom is important in the professional world.
“I tell people that the engineering classes that you take at USC are like the paint,” Russell said. “You’re learning how to make the paint, and it’s up to you to go and make a painting with those colors. If you don’t paint, then all you have is a bunch of colors and you won’t be going anywhere.”
Alex Zhang, a sophomore majoring in engineering commented on his experience with startups programs through the university.
“USC offers a host of incredible startup resources ranging from resourceful classes, funding avenues through pitch competitions and outlets for inspiration by hosting many industry giants such as Mark Cuban and Aaron Levie to name a few,” Zhang said.
He further explained that larger universities make it more difficult to be all-inclusive.
“However, with the university’s very fragmented landscape between schools, it’s often difficult to foster a cohesive community that involves all inputs required to build a business: design, development and business acumen,” Zhang said. “That being said, I believe a community of entrepreneurial spirit has begun to blossom through many of the grassroots movements championed by student organizations and programs because of their genetic cross-disciplinary makeup. The more alignment between our administration and the student-run startup community, the more diverse and thus successful our Trojan startups will become.”

Eighteen students from the Rossier School of Education were selected  as Innovation Scholars to take part in the ASU+GSV Summit, taking place in Scottsdale, Arizona, from April 6 through April 8. Selected students will listen to various keynote speakers discuss their experiences in the workforce.
The selected students represent multiple programs ranging from masters to doctorate degrees in various education fields.
To apply, students had to submit an “elevator pitch” regarding issues of education and change. The students were selected from 80 entries.
Noodle, the company sponsoring the Innovation Scholar program, is providing the winners with complimentary registration, travel and lodging for the summit.
The goal of the summit is to celebrate education innovation including the innovators and entrepreneurs in the education system.
Among the keynote speakers attending the event are founder of the Virgin Group Sir Richard Branson, Chairman, and CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz and U.S Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.
Andrea Kittelson, a USC student completing her doctorate in education, is one of the Innovation Scholars who will be attending the event. The proposal she submitted to earn admittance to the program related to child-parent education programs.
“Several studies show that a school has much less of an impact upon the academic success of a child than a child’s own parents,” Kittelson said. “My proposal is that K-12 schools educate parents and their children side-by-side in classes that are part of an extended day.”
Aside from USC, only four other universities were invited to take part in the offer. USC students will join Innovation Scholars from Harvard, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania and Arizona State University.
USC Rossier faculty Alan Arkatov, Ken Yates and Doug Lynch will join the USC students at the conference.
Doctoral candidate Vance Nichols of the Rossier School discussed Rossier’s participation in the summit.
“I think that Rossier being at this summit speaks volumes. It demonstrates how forward-thinking USC is about education and about meeting the needs of all students, regardless of their backgrounds. That commitment to focusing on all students, not just with equity but with adequacy … that’s the kind of thing that USC Rossier is about, and that’s what you see here.”
Currently in his 32nd year in the education field, Nichols serves as commissioner of the ACSI Regional Accreditation Commission and as chief academic officer of Riverside Christian Schools.
“To join colleagues and other instructors here at the summit is a tremendous honor and a great opportunity to mix with other educators and other innovators to really try to take education to the next level,” he said.

The School of Cinematic Arts will offer a new minor in media and social change starting in the fall of 2015.
The minor will teach students how to make impactful media by studying the professional practices of creating, analyzing and distributing media centered around social change.
Some of the courses offered in the minor include documentary production, writing and social change, nonfiction film and television and gender, sexuality and media.
Michael Taylor, executive director of the Media Institute for Social Change, said that the program’s courses will prepare students to create social change in their fields.
“It’s really to provide an opportunity for students who are interested in media content creation and research to take classes in a focused curriculum on various aspects of media for change,” Taylor said. “Students will gain insight into the professional practices of creating media content and analyzing existing content and learning how they can influence the future by integrating social issues into the work they are doing in related fields.”
Taylor created the minor after students came to him and asked how they could include issues of social change in their fields. Taylor said students wanted to use the social change skills to strengthen their work.
“What became clear to me was that so many students, not just in the School of Cinematic Arts, but from all over the university were starting to realize that media is the language of the 21st century,” Taylor said. “They can better do what they do by learning to speak that language and they can better do what they do in terms of spreading the messages that they want to spread- — having to do with various social issues — by working across disciplines with people from all over campus, and that’s what this minor is really intending to provide for students.”
According to Taylor, the minor strives to bring students from different majors together.
“It’s a pretty broad curriculum that’s really meant to appeal to people across various disciples, because what we are thinking is that by bringing people together from different schools [and] from different programs all around this subject of media and social change, it will enrich everyone’s point of view and everyone will be contributing a slightly different point of view,” Taylor said.
Students will benefit from working with other students with different majors, Taylor said.
“By working across disciplines and learning something about business, something about journalism, something about filmmaking, something about documentary filmmaking, fictional filmmaking, [and] by bringing public policy and sociology and education all together, I think it makes everyone stronger and enriches what everyone does in whatever career path they eventually take.”
Currently, there is a minor in photography and social change offered through Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and a nonprofit social innovation program in the Price School of Public Policy. Both programs are similar to media and social change in that they inspire social change and innovation.

There’s no doubt that the Internet has made way for new possibilities for streaming and distributing media across multiple platforms. School of Cinematic Arts sophomore Daniel Moya is taking these realities and applying them to his debut feature film Rental.
Rental is set in the last movie rental store on Earth and follows Darren, the store clerk, in real time during his last shift at the store as he interacts with customers who are each affected by cinema in different ways. Moya wrote and plans to direct the project, citing his own love of rental stores as inspiration. He also mentions rental stores’ dwindling numbers, as well as the advent of media distribution through smaller screens like computers and phones, as a major part of the message of the movie. “This is about change. Things are changing. [It’s about] letting go of things that you love,” Moya said. “It’s sad because [a video store] was like the middle man between the movie theater and owning a film.”
Moya is skeptical of the effect the Internet will have on the way that we take in movies.
“While it’s convenient, and it’s great for independent film as an option, [accessing film from the Internet] can’t sustain itself because people will lose interest … what makes [film] is the human connection.”
The film takes a look at the interactions people have in a special space like this. “The movie is almost exclusively made up of [Darren’s] interactions with different people. There’s a romance with his co-worker,” Moya said. “If I had to say what the movie is, it’s a romance at the end of the day. Between a lot of different things.”
Moya, along with a handful of friends and collaborators from the film school, plans to shoot his film this summer, but he’s asking the community at large to pitch in to make that happen. The crew has taken to Kickstarter to crowdfund $10,000 in order to begin shooting. As of Monday night, they’re already more than three fourths of the way done, with 17 days still left to raise funds.
“It’s been very humbling that people are responding well,” Moya said. “We’re taking this approach that we’re making it together. It’s for everyone.”
Moya wants to pay tribute to the time when video stores were a significant part of the movie-watching experience. “We’re kind of immortalizing this culture in a romantic way. Rental store culture is already kind of this romanticized version of film appreciation,” Keenan Mosimann, one of the film’s producers, said.
When asked how he brought a team together, Moya cited his work on previous projects with friends as the real indicator for who he wanted to join him on set. Most of the crewmembers for Rental originated from The Origami Team, a group of film students who joined together last year to make several short films for fun. Through countless hours spent working together, Moya knew they’d be the first ones he would ask to help out.
“We’re helping Daniel because we’ve all seen the quality of work that he’s capable of and we all believe in him and we want to help his next project become a reality,” said Elana Zeltser, one of the film’s producers. “And because of The Origami Team, we know we can work well together.”
Carter Feuerhelm, the film’s future director of photography and editor, expressed his enthusiasm in working with Moya.
“I think I’ve worked with Daniel on over a dozen creative ventures at this point, seems like we always turn out something good, something we’re really proud of, and I’m excited to hop on that ship again,” said Feuerhelm.
In terms of logistics, the crew plans to cast real actors around Los Angeles and will shoot at Cinefile Video in Santa Monica starting at the end of May.
“The store has a lot of character,” Zeltzer said. “After we visited I rewrote the script to make sure it went with the store’s layout,” Moya said. “It’s also free press for the store. They deserve it. They hung around.”
In order to film, the team struck a deal with Cinefile and agreed to shoot only at night, after the store closes.
“I think every rental store that exists now should get their own movie,” Moya later joked.
Moya then plans to edit for the rest of the summer, and hopefully be done by the end of the year.
“Carter and I are both going abroad for the spring, so hopefully it’ll be done by then and we’ll send it to festivals. I believe in this story, I want to make the movie and the exposure is an added benefit,” Moya said.

From frat parties to minimum-security prisons, The Mindy Project has pried open the tight bounds of basic cable television. The person to thank for the quick quips and classic histrionics is one of the show’s producers (at times, writer and director), David Stassen, who graduated with an MFA from USC in 2004. In his late 30s, the new father might be expected to look worried, as The Mindy Project has still not been renewed for a fourth season, but he is far from that. Stassen is a passionate Chicago native with an optimism and love for television that is almost contagious.
Prior to Mindy and post-graduation, Stassen began his career editing for ESPN to pay off student loans. After his 9-to-5 day, he would get together with childhood pal and Mindy co-writer Ike Barinholtz to write scripts. Stassen and Barinholtz were hoping to make it big. They met at summer camp at the tender age of 7, went to high school together and became best friends. Stassen attended Northwestern University and Barinholtz attended Boston University for a year before moving to Los Angeles.
“I’ve known him for 30 years. We just have the same sense of humor. All of our comedy experiences were pretty much together. We saw every movie together, every TV show together,” Stassen said.
In 2009, the pair caught a break by selling a movie. Stassen quit his ESPN day job and fully committed to writing. They worked on multiple projects, including a couple television scripts — one of which, an animated sitcom about the Wild West, was piloted by the television network Spike. Mindy Kaling read this script and hired the duo as writers on her show. Soon after, Barinholtz was cast as Morgan, a nurse with a “subservient, but assuming friendship” with Kaling’s character, Mindy Lahiri.
At The Mindy Project, when he’s not in the writer’s room, Stassen serves as an on-set writer during the production of every episode. This concept has been present in other successful comedies such as 30 Rock.
“When production starts, I get set for a shooting day, which is usually 7 a.m. on a Monday until 8 p.m. I’ll watch the rehearsal for every scene and work with the director and actors to have them figure out blocking,” Stassen said. “I’ll try and add physical comedy to scenes if the scene feels kind of flat. You never know from the page [of the script] to shooting how a scene is going actually feel.”
Stassen appreciates this hands-on approach to writing due to the close relationships he has formed with the show’s director of photography, actors and crew. Many shows choose to only have the writer of the episode present to watch the production; however, Stassen believes his presence creates a necessary continuity for the making of each episode.
“Sometimes there’s a bigger problem in the scene where the relationship between two characters might have changed, so the scene doesn’t feel right anymore. We might have to rewrite the scene on the fly in the moment. Being on set, you’re there everyday. It’s your last shot to get it right,” he said.
Though his Second City improv background has groomed him to throw out hilarious lines during shooting, Stassen did admit that Barinholtz and Kaling do improvise much of their dialogue.
“[Barinholtz and Kaling] have really strong improv backgrounds. We’ll open it up after a few takes. We always like to get it scripted first, so we’ll know the story will make sense,” he said. “But then we’ll improvise at the beginning of the scene or the end of the scene, and that’s really fun. Sometimes, the actors start improvising and that will inspire me to think of new jokes.”
The show is most notable for its eccentric characters, one of the  standouts is Morgan.One of his most comedic scenes is in season one, when the Shulman and Associates gang heads to a nightclub to let off steam. While the others are working the dance floor, Morgan, after handing a fellow club-goer a towel in the bathroom, is mistaken as a bathroom attendant. He then slyly slides an empty cup to collect a tip from this stranger. Though an event like this may seem out of the ordinary to a viewer, the idea was taken directly from Stassen’s life.
“I was in New Orleans and handed someone a towel in the bathroom of a bar. And just for kicks, I put a cup out and handed a couple more towels out. People started putting money in there, and I made 30 bucks in 10 minutes,” Stassen said.
Most stories are pitched as a combination of different personal experiences and vast extrapolations. The writing team will take something ordinary like a music festival or birthday party and turn it into an unusual event.
After working long hours, it seems natural that the writers might get sick of one another, but at The Mindy Project, they’ve managed to avoid this through a shared love of snacks.
“Being a comedy writer, food is really important. Every day we want to know, where are we having lunch from? What are the snacks?” Stassen said. “Did somebody send us cupcakes? If anything happens, like Mindy has a blurb in a tiny magazine, somebody sends us cupcakes. That kind of stuff is really fun.”

Grease is one of those musicals that has been etched into the American zeitgeist for decades. If the 1971 original Broadway production (and 15th longest-running Broadway show of all time) by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey didn’t make it into your lexicon by the time you hit puberty, then the 1978 film adaptation starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta definitely cemented itself somewhere in your childhood, not to mention the childhoods of everyone you know.
Therefore, the news that the School of Dramatic Arts would be staging a run of Grease from April 2 to April 12 might have been met with a bit of a groan and perhaps a “Why bother?” The choice to present a musical so famous and ubiquitous within the culture might seem like an odd one, especially because audience members have so much to compare it to. SDA’s version, however, more than lives up to expectations and provides a thrilling, fun ride from beginning to end.
From the very start of the show, its clear there are professionals at play. The set and art direction (by Dreem Qin) are clear and well thought out. The set itself is able to transform easily into the various different locations — high school, prom night, bedroom, living room, diner — with ease and little to no time wasted, which is important to note since so many productions often fall prey to poor timing with scene changes leading to dropped beats and a restless audience.
The director, Jeff Maynard, has clearly put thought into every specific detail, creating a well-oiled machine with few missed moments or awkward pauses. One particular interlude involves the car Grease Lightning as it’s wheeled off stage. Instead of waiting for the vehicle to disappear, Maynard instructed a bunch of his slick, tight-pants-wearing Greaser boys to flip and tumble around the stage in an acrobatic fashion — not only showing the dancers’ exciting and impressive prowess but also proving the director’s clear skill. Another wonderful interlude happens when the set must be changed completely, and Sandy (played by breath-of-fresh-air Sidne Phillips) sings the dazzling “Look at Me I’m Sandra Dee Reprise.” Another song of note is Phillips’ chillingly beautiful “Hopelessly Devoted to You,” which brought countless cries from the audience.
The first act of the musical might belong to the character of Kenickie, however, played by Jackson White. While the rest of the Burger Palace Boys attempt a tough guy swagger or accent (with some good moments but also some misses), White actually inhabits the character of Kenickie, playing the tough and dumb but ultimately likable bad boy with ease and definite talent. White’s commitment to character and love story with Rizzo (a pretty good Perry Mattfeld, who needed just a bit more conviction and stage presence to really sell her character) almost outshined Sandy and Danny Zucko (a manly and fun Austin Humble), the couple we want to root for from the beginning. Sandy and Danny’s time definitely comes by the end of the show, however, with a fun “You’re the One That I Want” that got the entire audience clapping with joy.
In a small role, Bella Hicks as Frenchy not only effectively embraces the character but is also one of the standout dancers of the evening, infecting any ensemble dancing piece with zeal and skill. Outside of the Pink Lady’s group is Shefali Deshpande as Patty — a role with little to no reward in the film adaptation but in this rendition provides a star-making turn for Deshpande, whose voice is not only clear as a bell but also gives the best and the most perfect high-pitched shrieks at the appropriately funny time.
Tucker Aust’s nerdy and awkward Eugene is also another minor character who packs a lot of punch, peppering his too few scenes with great comedic timing. But perhaps the most standout performance of them all is Carter Shults’ in the role of “Teen Angel,” who coaches Frenchy to finally drop out of beauty school and “go back to high school.” Shults’ falsetto reaches incredible heights and then dips into deep lows without a single hitch but with a lot of perfect sass and attitude, bringing to mind a young Neil Patrick Harris if he ever donned a bright white suit and sang among a string of chorus girls dressed like hairdresser angels replete with mauve pink feathered fans that turn into angel wings at just the right moment. Shults’ last high-pitch notes sent the audience into a roar of adulation, effectively bringing the house down and rounding out the middle of the second act.
If there’s anything to be learned from the show it is that there’s just something about a group of girls in period-appropriate flannel pajamas and cotton nightgowns, clutching hairspray cans or, in Rizzo’s case, a bottle of wine as they sing a ballad about boys that still delights and satisfies the viewer. Costume designer Amelia Brookins deserves a lot of credit for the scope and detail of each of the costumes. The Burger Palace Boys uniformity in tight blue Levi’s 501s and various Converse All Stars paired with the infamous greaser leather jackets was not simply classic, but pitch perfect. The ensemble sequences particularly highlighted the brilliance of the costume design, especially on prom night, in which each actor was not only period-appropriate but interesting and different in their own ways.
The musical ran about two hours, and save for the oddly confusing choice of including the song “Magic Changes” early in the first act (that’s thankfully quickly forgotten with a particularly fun version of “Freddy, My Love”), every moment was fun to watch. The show flew by, even if we’d all seen it before.

Lisa Leslie has been named one of the 11 members of the class of 2015 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. She will also be inducted to the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame later this year.
In her tenure as a Trojan (1990-1994), Leslie was a National Player of the Year and an All-American. Following her graduation from USC, Leslie was a three-time WNBA MVP and a four-time Olympic gold medalist.
As the third Women of Troy basketball player to be named to the Hall of Fame, Leslie stands in elite company. Cheryl Miller and Cynthia Cooper, USC’s current women’s basketball coach, are the other former Trojans already in the Hall of Fame. Also in the class of 2015 is former USC men’s basketball coach, George Raveling.
From early on in her basketball career, Leslie made a name for herself. When she first started playing basketball in junior high — at the height of 6-foot-1 — Leslie was a force to be reckoned with. She continued to mature in her play and garner attention from top colleges across the country.
In 1991, her first year at USC, Leslie was named the National Freshman of the Year and helped USC to the Pac-10 title. Leading the country in scoring and rebounding, Leslie was the first rookie of the Pac-10 to be selected for the first team and for NCAA Freshman of the Year.
She carried her outstanding freshman year and continued to dazzle on the court for the Women of Troy the rest of her time in school. Her career at USC was composed of countless accolades as she was a three-time All-American (1992-1994), four-time All-Pac-10 team member (first Pac-10 player to ever do so) and as a senior she was the unanimous 1994 Naismith National Player of the Year.
Her presence is still felt at USC as her retired #33 jersey hangs up in the rafters of the Galen Center. Also, she is still USC’s all-time leading shot blocker (321), No. 3 leading scorer (20.1 ppg), No. 4 rebounder (10.1 rpg), No. 5 in free throws made (461) and No. 8 in all-time steals (228).
On an Olympic stage, Leslie helped the USA capture the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Games, the 2000 Sydney Games, the 2004 Athens Games and the 2008 Beijing Games.
In the WNBA, Leslie was a member of the Los Angeles Sparks for 13 seasons. In 2001 and 2002, Leslie led the Sparks to back-to-back WNBA Championships.
Not only was Leslie the first woman to ever dunk in a professional basketball game, but she also was named to the All-WNBA first team eight times and the second team four times, and was honored as a Western Conference All-Star eight times and received MVP honors several times.
She is still the WNBA’s leader in career rebounds and second in career blocked shots. Her retired #9 uniform — one of two for the Sparks — hangs high in the rafters at the Staples Center to commemorate her legacy with the Sparks.

By the time you are reading this, March Madness will officially be in the books and college basketball will have a new champion after capturing America’s attention for the past few weeks. If you’re like me, and you’re wondering what you’re going to do with your life now that the tournament is over, don’t worry because Monday officially kicked off the 2015 baseball season.
The USC baseball team has experienced success so far this season, and here’s to hoping the Dodgers can experience similar success and finally make it deep into the playoffs. Whether you’re a Dodger fan or not, America’s favorite pastime is back, and there are so many teams to look out for this season.
At the bottom of my list of teams to watch is the Houston Astros. I admit that the only reason the ‘Stros even made the list is because of my personal ties to the team, but things are looking up for them this season, and maybe they won’t finish dead last this year. The recent move to the American League has been anything but easy for Houston, but they’ve added some depth to the bullpen and defense. Second baseman Jose Altuve returns and looks to carry last season’s offensive success into 2015. By putting this team on my list, I mean that they might hit a .500 record this year.
Another team that has been somewhat quiet lately — by their standards, of course — is the New York Yankees. The Yankees are a veteran team that will now be without a captain. The team’s age raises a lot of concerns regarding injury, especially in the pitching rotation. Probably the biggest headline for the Yankees is the return of Alex Rodriguez from a yearlong suspension. I don’t think the Yankees will be a huge threat this season, but they are the Yankees and could definitely prove me wrong.
The Detroit Tigers enter 2015 on the hunt for their              fifth-straight AL Central title. The pitching rotation has taken a blow due to injuries. Even Justin Verlander will be hampered due to a strained tricep. Though the pitching rotation has suffered some blows, the offense should remain strong enough to give the Tigers a chance at the playoffs.
The Pittsburgh Pirates have emerged in the past couple seasons as playoff contenders and look to continue their playoff streak this season. They don’t have quite the potential that they had last season, but if they can successfully overcome injuries they could make a run for the postseason.
The San Diego Padres are definitely a team on the rise, especially after the offseason they had. They added former Dodgers star Matt Kemp on the offense, and closer Craig Kimbrel from the Atlanta Braves. They have to compete in a tough NL West Division against the Dodgers and Giants, but if their offseason additions pan out, they could make a run for the NL West title.
The Los Angeles Angels are a force to be reckoned with, even if they have to play without Josh Hamilton. The combination of reigning American League MVP Mike Trout and Albert Pujols should more than make up for Hamilton’s absence. Their offense will be enough to carry whatever their defense lacks.
The Angels’ crosstown rivals, the Dodgers, look to reclaim their NL West title. The          one-two punch of NL MVP and Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke lead the pitching rotation. Behind them is explosive outfielder Yasiel Puig and new addition Joc Pederson, along with shortstop Jimmy Rollins.
Unfortunately for the Dodgers, the St. Louis Cardinals aren’t going anywhere and seem to be Kershaw’s achilles’ heel. The Cardinals have a dominant offense headlined by Jason Heyward and a bullpen led by Adam Wainwright. The Cardinals have made a strong postseason showing the past few seasons and could finally make the push to the World Series this season.
A record 115 players begin the season on the disabled list, and unfortunately for the reigning champions, Hunter Pence is one of the 115. Their rotation behind Madison Bumgarner is aging quickly, but no one thought the Giants would make it deep into the postseason last year, and they took home the title.
Yesterday was day one of a long season, and as we’ve seen in the past, anything can happen.

The baseball team looks to extend its five-game winning streak Tuesday night against the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos. The Trojans      (25-6, 7-2 Pac-12) benefitted from an offensive outburst this weekend en route to a three-game series sweep on the road against the University of Arizona Wildcats.
In the first game of the series on Thursday, USC and Arizona took a 1-1 tie into the seventh inning, as both Trojan starter Brent Wheatley and Wildcat starter Cody Hamlin shook off early runs and each turned in dominant performances.
The Trojan offense finally broke through in the top of the seventh, however, as a go-ahead triple off the bat of Dante Flores keyed a         three-run outburst to put USC up 4-1.
They would not relinquish the lead as reliever Brooks Kriske earned his second win of the season with 3.1 scoreless innings of relief.
Even though the game represented USC’s first win in Tucson since 2009, the Trojans were far from finished.
On Friday, the Trojans jumped out to such a big lead in the first inning, it was as if the game was over before it really started.
USC exploded for seven runs on eight hits in the top of the first inning, as they knocked out Wildcat starter Robby Medel after only one-third of an inning.
The Trojans never looked back, as small Wildcat rallies were squashed relatively quickly and retaliated with more USC scoring. After Arizona made it 7-2 in the bottom of the third, USC responded with five more runs in the next two innings to push the score to 12-2.
Though the Wildcats touched up reliever Mason Perryman for three runs and scored one off Bernardo Flores, the Trojans scored one more run to account for a final score of 13-6. Flores went 3.1 innings of  one-run ball to earn his first save of the year and guarantee a series win for the Trojans.
The series sweep was far from a guarantee, however, as the Trojans and Wildcats fought in a                  back-and-forth battle in the series finale on Saturday.
After falling into an early 5-1 deficit, USC rallied in the top of the fourth inning to put up seven runs and knock Wildcat starter Tyger Talley out of the game. Arizona clawed its way back from the 8-5 deficit, however.
Arizona and USC traded runs in the bottom of the fourth and top of the fifth to push the game to 9-6, but the Wildcats were able to tie the game with two runs in the seventh and another in the eighth.
With the game deadlocked at 9-9 going into the top of the ninth, the Trojans scrapped together a rally and pushed the go-ahead run across the plate with an infield single off the bat of David Oppenheim.
Saturday’s 10-9 win completed USC’s first series sweep in Tucson since 2001.
“We have more depth this season than we have in a really long time. When one guy isn’t able to get it done, another guy steps up,” head coach Dan Hubbs said when asked what makes this year’s team so much different than in the past.
“This weekend was kind of a microcosm of the entire season. This group is really resilient and they’re older, so they know how to handle adversity. They bring energy every day and they really understand the importance of every game.”
Up next, the Trojans welcome in the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos  (23-7), who handed USC its first loss of the season when they faced off on March 3 in Santa Barbara, winning 3-2.
In their last matchup, the Gauchos held the Trojan offense at bay and were able to capitalize on a ninth inning rally to walk off on an RBI single off the bat of              pinch-hitter Dalton Kelly.
Though it would be easy for USC to focus on the past, Hubbs said the last game is behind them and thinks his team will be able to come out strong against UCSB.
“We didn’t feel like we played our best game the last time, but Santa Barbara is an excellent team,” Hubbs said. “At the end of the day we just want to win the game no matter who we play.”
The Gauchos come into the game riding a wave of momentum, having won six straight and 10 of their last 11 games. The Trojans will be put to the test on Tuesday, as UCSB features a trio of strong hitters who have led the way for them all season.
Outfielders Cameron Newell (.343 batting average) and Andrew Calica (.352 batting average), plus designated hitter Robby Nesovic (.369 batting average) have powered the UCSB offense thus far in the season, and shutting them down will be crucial to the Trojans’ ability to beat them this time around.
“The biggest thing about Santa Barbara is keeping their leadoff guy off base. Calica sets the table really well for them and can run. [Newell and Nesovic] can both hit, but if you look at the game we played in Santa Barbara, [Nesovic] was probably the reason they won,” Hubbs said.
The USC baseball team continues to win and moved all the way up to the No. 7 ranking in the country on Monday. As a team that has projected confidence all season and has openly talked about strong playoff aspirations, their winning ways have solidified their confidence but have not led them to take any opponents for granted.
Hubbs insists this team still has a lot of work to do in order to reach their goal of a College World Series berth.
“If we continue to do what we’re doing, we’ll put ourselves in a position to play in the regionals which is something that hasn’t been done around here in a while,” Hubbs said.

After splitting with conference rivals over the weekend, the men’s volleyball team returns home today for its final                                  nonconference tune-up before the end of the regular season and the start of the postseason.
The No. 7 Trojans (15-8, 13-7 MPSF) maintained their spot in fourth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference standings after beating Stanford but falling to Pepperdine last week. On Tuesday, they host Concordia in a break from MPSF play.
Concordia, which plays in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics rather than the NCAA, will return to the Galen Center for the second-straight year. Though not a conference or NCAA match, it will count as an official match and not a scrimmage or exhibition event.
Concordia (14-10), the No. 6 team in the NAIA, won the NAIA national championship in 2013. This season, against other MPSF opponents in the NCAA, Concordia has defeated unranked UC San Diego (2-23, 0-19 MPSF) and No. 21 Stanford (10-14, 7-11) but has fallen to No. 13 UC Santa Barbara (14-8, 10-8).
Last year, the Trojans took down the Eagles in four sets (27-25, 25-18, 21-25, 25-18). The Trojans celebrated Senior Night that match, honoring the five seniors on the squad. Then-senior opposite Tanner Jansen led the team with 20 kills, 11 digs and four blocks. Though toward the end of the regular season, the Trojans will not be celebrating Senior Night just yet this season, saving that ceremony for the team’s final home game on April 18 against unranked Cal Baptist (6-20, 2-18).
The match today is the only official, organized competition for the team this week. This Saturday, the team will celebrate the program’s alumni with an alumni exhibition match at the Galen Center. Head coach Bill Ferguson said in his weekly media recap that members of the current team would draft two teams of alumni players to compete against each other, then the two alumni teams will join together to compete against the current team.
“I think that’s kind of unique,” he said. “I think most times, a lot of schools just get the alumni to play against the varsity team and that’s it. We want our alumni guys to be able to play and play against each other. By having our guys draft the team, I think it’s really fun and it brings a connection that’s a little bit tighter.”
Ferguson said it’s a great event for the team, especially as they prepare to head into playoffs.
“It’s a very important day for us every year and we’re glad it happens at the end of the year,” he said. “It kind of reinvigorates the alumni, gets some face-to-face contact with our guys, and maybe it’ll spur a few of them on to come to a match or two or a playoff game.”
The Trojans were swept on the road by No. 8 Pepperdine (21-4, 16-4) on April 2  (25-20, 25-14, 25-20), but they came back with a sweep of Stanford the following Saturday (25-23, 25-22, 25-18). The Trojans split with the Waves on the season, having beaten them at home earlier this season in four sets, but swept the Cardinal on the year after also winning in three sets when they hosted Stanford.
Ferguson said that while several different players on the team were hitting for a high percentage, the team didn’t do a good enough job passing and serving to keep up with Pepperdine.
“We were doing some great stuff attacking on the pins,” he said. “Unfortunately…  Pepperdine was just serving great and we were out of system the whole night.”
The Trojans are one of four MPSF teams to have clinched a spot in the conference tournament. The top eight teams in the conference standings of the 12-team conference qualify for the tournament. The winner of the tournament earns an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Three other conferences in the NCAA have automatic qualifiers and there are an additional two at-large bids to the tournament.
The Trojans currently sit behind No. 1 Hawai’i (21-3, 16-2), No. 4 UC Irvine (22-4, 16-3) and Pepperdine in the conference standings. Hawai’i, UC Irvine and Pepperdine have all clinched at least one home match in the MPSF tournament. USC would play its first round match at home if the current standings remained the same at the end of the season, but the Trojans have not guaranteed their spot in the top four yet.
Chasing behind the Trojans are UC Santa Barbara and No. 6 BYU (13-9, 10-8). Though USC has three more wins and one less loss, both could hypothetically still jump the Trojans in the standings with two games at hand. USC split the season series with both the Gauchos and Cougars, but won fewer sets in both pairs of       head-to-head matchups. The Trojans can avoid the tiebreaker, however, and clinch the fourth spot with a season sweep of Cal Baptist next week to close the season.
The Trojans take on Concordia tonight at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.

Trevor Noah was born in South Africa from a black mother from Soweto and a white Swiss father. His parents’ interracial relationship was illegal under apartheid, which made his mixed culture not so popular in his neighborhood. His childhood forced him to coexist with cultures, languages and people entirely different from his own.
Instead of turning prejudice into more prejudice, Noah took what he learned growing up and turned it into intelligent humor.
Noah grew to be one of the most, if not the most, successful and loved comedians in South Africa. He hosted his own show there, Tonight with Trevor Noah, for two years. He has since performed across the world, from Late Show with David Letterman to the Sydney Opera House, was a contributor for Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show in 2012 and got drafted to The Daily Show in December.
On March 30, Trevor Noah was announced as Jon Stewart’s successor for The Daily Show. Though some used the announcement to celebrate his accomplishments and welcome a new, younger voice to The Daily Show, there were others who weren’t as confident in his abilities and took it upon themselves to rummage through his Twitter.
The tweets that they found were not appealing. In fact, they were very offensive. The notion that these tweets make Trevor Noah unqualified for the job, however, is closed-minded.
Noah said in a documentary that throughout his life, he has felt that his mixed race has caused him to be perpetually excluded. He has come to realize that when “you’ve lived everywhere and nowhere, and you’ve been everyone and no one … you can say everything and nothing and that’s really what affects my comedy and everything I say.”
Noah is known for being one of the more tame South African comedians. Kagiso Lediga, a fellow South African comedian told The Atlantic that Noah has “always been the most clean, polite comic on stage. He’s the one you’d take your mom to watch.” He doesn’t target audience members or curse, and mostly mimics to portray, not to ridicule.
As a man from a mixed background in a mixed and formerly legally bigoted country, Noah has an acutely unique perspective on our globalized world. He is known for his ability to speak to the humanity in everyone, to cross lines of race and culture and make any audience laugh.
To look at these few tweets and call him a bigot ignores Noah’s background. It claims, without evidence, that he has not grown as a comedian and person since the tweets were written. There are very few comedians who would be still in business if we deemed them illegitimate when a few unsettling jokes they made in the past didn’t land. Noah is not a bigot. Talking about bigotry and being a bigot are two separate things, and surely an organization as established, not to mention as progressive, as The Daily Show has already vetted him thoroughly in that regard.
If Noah makes lowbrow, humorless jokes on The Daily Show, you can be sure they’ll cut him loose. But that’s not what he’ll do. His international perspective, youth and sensitivity with his audience will skyrocket his success. While he might have never felt a true sense of belonging anywhere, Noah is just what The Daily Show needs. One can only hope Comedy Central can give him the stage he’s been searching for.

For 16 years, comedian Jon Stewart has been a satirical news powerhouse. No one has been able to compete with Stewart’s beat of comedy — not The Onion, not even the guys at Saturday Night Live’s “Weekend Update.” And now, with Stewart’s announcement that he is to leave the show later this year, he passes on the torch to a relatively unknown comedian, Trevor Noah.
Taking a look at Noah’s Twitter feed gives people a clue as to what brand of humor he has in store. His past tweets include misogynistic updates on his weekend, proclaiming, “People are going to get drunk & think I’m sexy! -fat chicks everywhere.” His offensive comments also extend to racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic musings. Though Comedy Central stands by Noah, proclaiming that he “pushes boundaries” and is “provocative,” Noah’s humor is just plain insulting, and thus, the network must reconsider their choice of their new host.
I have the utmost respect for Noah’s field because getting a genuine laugh is one of the hardest things to accomplish. It requires impeccable presentation and erudition. Simply put, comedy is really, really hard. Sometimes, the laugh received depends on the audience’s subjectivity. Comedy, however, does not depend on the ability to be edgy or how much a joke stings.
Too often, we give satirists a “get out of jail free” card because satire is supposedly sprung from intellect. We’re taught in our high school literature classes that irony is the most difficult form of prose to master because it supposedly reveals something about the human condition. When an offensive joke receives backlash, say one that bashes a minority group, there’s still a proportion of the population that gives kudos to the comedian. The excuse is that the comedian is pushing the envelope, and that we need to chill out; it’s all in good fun, and no one is really getting hurt.
Obviously, with the amount of attention Noah is getting, people are, in fact, feeling the burn, and rightfully so. If Noah can be so derogatory on a casual platform such as Twitter, he can’t be expected to treat delicate situations — such as the crisis in the Middle East and the gender wage gap — in a sensitive manner.
There’s a correct way to approach humor, and the past hosts of the Golden Globe awards best illustrate what the way should or shouldn’t be. Ricky Gervais, the host until 2011, targeted everybody in the room by airing their dirty laundry, kicking people while they were down. Gervais received so much backlash that he was removed from the stage the last time he hosted the ceremony. The subsequent hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler achieved acclaim because they didn’t go after individual people. Rather, they facetiously criticized Hollywood, the pretentious film mecca. The duo wasn’t perfect — here’s looking at that Margaret Cho sketch from this year — but they knew not to marginalize people for an aspect of their lives that they could not control. Noah deviates completely from their example through his tweets, which is basically all that people have to go off of at this point. He capitalizes upon human weakness.
The deed is done, and Trevor Noah is set to make young liberals laugh in front of a television screen. But here’s a tip for him: stop making “fat chicks” your punch line.

Last week, the words “Cosmopolitan” and “racist” were hurled around in the same sentence.
In January, Cosmopolitan published an article on its website titled “21 Beauty Trends That Need to Die in 2015.” Initially, the article came and went, until it resurfaced on Twitter late last month. Cosmopolitan was accused of using women of color to illustrate the trends that “need to die,” and only white women to illustrate the new, fashion-forward beauty trends in a series of images titled “Hello Gorgeous.”
Though Cosmopolitan has not removed the article from its website, they have issued a public apology for any offense they might have caused, and — before perusing the article, readers are met with a statement reading: “A note from the editor: This article focuses on beauty trends with images that represent those trends. Some images have been taken out of context, and we apologize for any offense. Celebrating all women is our mission, and we will continue to work hard to do that.”
People have criticized the article as a blatant case of racism with the implication that ethnic diversity is out of fashion, but the issues raised are not so black and white. The article also used white women to embody the trends that “need to die.” In fact, out of the 21 condemned trends, fewer than 10 are portrayed by non-white women. Thus, the media’s focus on the diversity issue in this case misses the point.
The overall lack of diversity in the article, however, is certainly a mistake on the part of Cosmopolitan. As a publication with significant influence over young women and a central force in defining what we consider to be attractive, Cosmopolitan undoubtedly has a responsibility to promote diversity.
The title certainly doesn’t help its case- — “21 Beauty Trends That Need To Die in 2015” is a very aggressive way to start an article. Though a different title probably wouldn’t have stopped the backlash that has arisen, such a provocative title is going to catch people’s attention. It isn’t a far leap for readers to subconsciously equate this hostile language with Cosmopolitan’s attitude toward women of color, so that part is understandable.
But more significantly, the controversy took a long time to attract any attention. Several months elapsed before anyone made a comment on the lack of diversity in this article, then over a matter of days, it became headline news. Surely, if Cosmopolitan was as derogatory as many people are making it out to be, the issue would have garnered attention immediately. Indeed, the reaction on Twitter has been intense. On April 1, @KillioussBey wrote, “Boycott @Cosmopolitan this is downright disgusting.” This message was accompanied by a photo from the article. Even famous faces have chimed in on the controversy, with supermodel Joan Smalls, one of the faces sporting a trend that “needs to die” in the article, calling the article “tasteless” and unfollowed Cosmopolitan. Yet the wrath of this reaction directed at Cosmopolitan is disproportionate to the issue at hand. Yes, the article seemed to have targeted women of color, but it is not a callous example of racism in the modern age.
In the end, the issue is unresolved because at the center of this controversy is the lack of representation in the industry, not just in the magazine. There’s no doubt that Cosmopolitan should take a more active role in celebrating women of color in their articles, but there is a difference between systemic racism and an unintentional lack of diversity. At the end of the day, nobody should feel degraded or insulted because of their race. People should examine the entertainment industry as a whole before pointing their fingers at Cosmopolitan.
As racism continues to be a prevalent issue in American culture, it is more crucial than ever for the media to showcase the beauty of all people, no matter their race. It has to be acknowledged, however, that this issue points to the continuing lack of racial diversity in the fashion and entertainment industry as a whole. Therefore, this incident serves to showcase the need for greater diversity across an entire industry, as opposed to being an isolated incident of racism by one corporation.
The author’s title says the backlash is undeserved, even though the author spends most of this piece explaining how the Cosmopolitan article is indeed flawed for varying sorts of racist insensitivity.  I think that’s basically what the backlash is all about.  It seems that those who are complaining are suggesting that the Cosmopolitan article is another example of “the need for greater diversity across an entire industry”.  There’s a lot of wavering back and forth in this piece but in the end it appears to me that the author agrees with the backlash far more than she disagrees with it.
All of that said, articles like this always serve to remind me how horribly confused most people are with the difference between “racist” and “racial”.  Time and time again, this confusion is demonstrated, typically with political or selfish undertones.  There is a critical distinction that is rarely understood.  Actual racism is of course wrong and immoral by any decent person’s standards, not everything that has a racial component is racist.  There are racial components to many things in life and society.  Take illegal immigration for example.  Identifying the fact that the majority of illegal immigration to U.S. is by Hispanics or Latinos is not racist.  It’s simply identifying a racial component to the illegal immigration debate.  Noting that engineering schools are filled with Asians, that airline pilots are typically caucasion, or that NBA basketball players are predominantly black… are all fair observations to be made.  They identify racial components to the conversation at hand.  Of course the accuracy of a comment can always be challenged, but it is unfair to target people or companies as “racist” when in fact a comment or article or conversation might simply be identifying racial elements.  There’s a huge and important difference.
For full disclosure, I have not read the Cosmopolitan article at issue.  However my guess is that there was nothing racist or insensitive about it.  Cosmopolitan Magazine reports on fashion news and trends, and the fact is that many issues of fashion have racial components because people of certain ethnicity start them, or celebrate their culture through them.  It’s not a good thing that open and sincere discussion can’t include racial components.

Officially defining who gets to be called a person under the law has always been a controversial issue. Arguments over the beginning of personhood have defined the abortion debate. The Citizens United ruling has brought corporate citizenship to the forefront of debate. And now Indiana’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has brought up the question of the legitimacy of religious personhood.
In short, the thing that made Indiana’s RFRA so controversial is that its definition of personhood changes who can file suits about discrimination. If a religious entity, like a church, counts as a person, then that church can go sue an individual, a corporation, the government or another similar party if the religious entity feels as though it has been or is likely to be “substantially burdened” in their practice of their religion by the other party.
This development raised concerns for LGBT activists who pointed out that this would give religious institutions carte blanche to discriminate against LGBT community members while under the protection of the law. The public was enraged, fusing disparate organizations like the NCAA, Wilco and the several states — New York, Connecticut and Washington — together to protest this act. To stave off controversy, Indiana’s RFRA has since been amended to include specific language that bans discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.
Though many organizations, including the ACLU, argue that there is more to be done in Indiana, the controversy has been effectively laid to rest. The debate for LGBT rights has been effectively reignited in the public’s consciousness, but the debate that should gain equal footing should be the debate over the ethics of personhood.
At the heart of Indiana’s RFRA case, controversy was stirred ultimately by the fact that non-humans are increasingly given rights that should be reserved exclusively to persons. In this case, a line in the sand was drawn: Religious entities should not have the same protections against discrimination as natural persons. But it’s time to draw the line in more places. Should religious entities have any rights at all? If yes, which ones? What about corporations? Organizations? Fetuses? These legal distinctions drastically redefine the way that our society functions on under the law.
It’s far beyond time that people — the kind with two arms, two legs and a beating heart — get involved in the debate.

The other day, my friend and I launched into a conversation about the music industry, one that was both enlightening and frustrating to someone hoping to one day work in the business. He advocated for free access to music, a sentiment shared by the majority of our peers, and his arguments ranged from “I refuse to buy into corporate greed” to “art should be made for the sake of artistic expression.”
After pestering him with my argument that we as consumers are obligated to pay for a product that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to create, he finally uttered those magical words that have come to define my generation.
“But if other people pay for it, I don’t think I should have to!”
And there it is.
Born in the 1980s to early 2000s, millennials have become infamous for a crippling sense of entitlement, the mentality that we belong to a higher caste of humanity and deserve things we don’t work for.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why the music industry is screwed. The majority of its key marketing demographic doesn’t want to pay for anything. 
The issue is that even though we love music, there’s this huge discrepancy between our perception regarding the cultural value of music and the financial value of music. Every party, wedding reception, restaurant, gym or department store I have ever been to has played music. Film and television producers use music to bring their works to life. I have never met anyone who didn’t have a favorite band, musician, genre or song.
We all love music in every aspect of our lives. So why does this dichotomy between loving music yet refusing to pay for it exist?
The answer lies in the concept of convenience.
The music industry was booming in the 1980s because if you wanted new music, you had to actually go to a brick-and-mortar record store and buy a physical product. There was a sentimental experience associated with purchasing and listening to music. With the advent of the Internet, however, digital piracy and file sharing have given consumers free and unlimited, albeit illegal, access to music. Now let’s be honest — there’s nothing more convenient than sitting at home, downloading thousands of songs at no cost.
And then, in 2008, two Swedish guys came to the rescue. Or so it seemed.
Hailing from Stockholm, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon founded Spotify, a digital music streaming service that provides users unlimited access to music. The service offers a free-to-consumer model that is funded by advertising revenue and a paid subscription version for $9.99 a month. It’s a music library that’s limitless, interactive, user-friendly and legal. On the surface, Spotify seemed like the knight in shining armor to the music industry.
But they have just one teeny little problem that could potentially wipe out not only their own business, but also the entire music industry as we know it. Spotify is giving the milk away for free, and now nobody wants to buy the cow.
The free-to-consumer ad-revenue model of Spotify was created with the intention of introducing users to the service and ultimately converting them to paying subscribers. But it’s now 2015, seven years since Spotify first launched, and since then, the music industry has continued playing the waiting game, hoping that the Swedish service will figure out how to turn a profit and finally start paying musicians their fair share.
Looking at their financial statements, however, it’s actually the 75 percent of Spotify’s users who don’t pay for their use of the service who are the problem. Until Spotify can generate more profit through paid subscriptions, they can’t afford to pay musicians fair royalty rates.
The “freemium” or low-consumer-cost business structure will continue shrinking the music industry’s aggregate revenue pool, and while it’s hard to see the immediate effects today, the ultimate production of music that we know and love will certainly see creative consequences as a result of the lacking financial support.
In July 2014, Taylor Swift wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal arguing for the financial value of music as an art form. Then, in November 2014, the singer-songwriter made headlines by removing her entire catalogue from Spotify because the service refused to offer her music exclusively to premium subscribers. A longtime advocate of paid music distribution, Swift used her clout as the highest-selling artist of the year to speak for those musicians and songwriters who don’t have the bargaining power to stand up to Spotify.
Yet even with her economic power, Swift alone can’t create any real substantial change on the digital streaming landscape that is threatening the music industry.
Enter music businessman extraordinaire and answerer of the music industry’s prayers, Jay-Z.
Late last month, the hip-hop mogul, after purchasing Swedish music technology company, Aspiro AB, for $54 million, relaunched Tidal, the company’s digital music streaming service. The service gained widespread media attention due to its equity partnerships with 16 of music’s biggest stars, including Madonna, Kanye West, Rihanna and Jack White.
The service, unlike Spotify, offers a limited free-trial period before requiring subscribers to pay for their use of the platform. Tidal currently offers two subscriptions: a standard version for $9.99 and a high-definition sound quality version for $19.99.
Still in its introductory period, Tidal has already received mixed reactions from both consumers and industry experts. Some question whether or not the service will see any financial success or market share gains. Others are criticizing it as being the music industry’s top one percent demanding an even higher paycheck like greedy, overpaid celebrities. At the end of the day, everyone is wondering whether or not Tidal can actually succeed.
The thing is, Tidal doesn’t need to succeed in order to be successful. It’s real purpose is in its name: it’s making waves in the industry, a feat that no other service since Spotify has been able to do. Tidal is revitalizing the conversation about the monetary value of music and by pledging to pay much higher royalty margins than Spotify and its other competitors, it makes the point of saying, “Hey, songwriters. Your music matters, and people should pay you for making it.”
The point isn’t to make Jay-Z or Madonna or Kanye West richer. Tidal is essentially serving as a creative labor union for all musicians, songwriters, and producers — everyone involved in the process of creating music. By gathering music’s elite as spokespeople for the service, Jay-Z is forcing people to listen to Tidal’s message:
Dear consumers, technology companies, and anyone that benefits from the intellectual property of creative thinkers,
Music is valuable, both culturally and monetarily. Let’s start treating it with the respect that it deserves.
Sincerely,
The Music Industry
Music is important. It’s one of the most important forms of art that exists today, and we are the future of this art, the ones responsible for keeping it alive. So let’s be part of the solution, not the problem.
(Reuters) – Shares in music streamer Aspiro, a majority of which was bought earlier this month by hip-hop star Jay-Z, soared on Tuesday to as much as 11 times the price at which remaining shares will be acquired in a compulsory squeeze-out only days away.
In what appeared to reflect investors clamouring too late for a piece of Aspiro’s music streaming service Tidal, the shares were up 938 percent at 11 Swedish crowns just before trading was halted.

A mere 20 minutes away from campus, sitting right on Sunset Boulevard is the small and rustic, yet lively Diablo Taco. A heavy wooden door will open its way to a dungeon-like room with brick walls and a high-top wooden table that crosses the whole restaurant. Food is self-served, with the menu displayed on a huge chalkboard across one of the walls, listing everything from tacos and quesadillas to innovative drinks like popsicle micheladas and house sangria.
Tacos come in single orders, an option that allows you to order different ones and try them all with more convenience. The tacos are plain flour tortillas with different toppings, including shrimp, pork chops and chicken. The taste per se is decent, and they definitely are a little overpriced, given that most of their specialties range from $5 to $7, and taste just as good as any taco truck in L.A. that will charge you barely $2 for just one taco.
If you do decide to go to Diablo Taco for dinner, however, you can’t leave without trying their corn dish, which consists of grilled corn off the cob in a deep bowl accompanied with paprika, cotija cheese and just the right amount of lemon truffle oil to add just the right tinge of sweet and sour.

The best part about Diablo Taco is their innovative micheladas. A michelada is a typical Mexican drink of your choice of beer blended with tomato juice, freshly squeezed lime-juice, spices and the optional hot sauce. The cool thing with Diablo Taco is that they will give you the beer in a glass and the michelada mix in the form of a popsicle. You can eat it, dip it, or let it melt inside your drink, but either way, it’s a great way to enjoy this authentic Latin American drink.

The ambience is also cool. At the entrance, they have loads of board games that you can play with your friends, from Connect Four to Apples to Apples, and even Cards Against Humanity.
The bottom line is that if you’re feeling like treating yourself on a Friday night, Diablo Taco is definitely worth the trip to Silverlake, despite its slightly expensive price range.

When it comes to street food, Armando’s, Amazebowls and the Boba Truck are just a few favorites among USC students. Whether it’s dim sum, burritos or Korean BBQ, you can’t go wrong with the kitchens of the streets — both here in L.A. and the world beyond. Street food vending is a global phenomenon, from bustling night markets to food stand festivals. Fellow Trojans studying abroad took to the local roads for some scrumptious grub, and captured a few shots to commemorate select delicious moments.
