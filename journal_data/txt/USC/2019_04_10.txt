Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams have been enjoying their fair share of success so far this season. The men’s and women’s teams, ranked No. 11 and No. 13 in the nation, respectively, have shown teams across the U.S. that they are a threat. The men’s team is currently second in the Pac-12  only behind UCLA, while the women are third in the conference behind Stanford and Washington.
The men’s team looks to capitalize on its home advantage in each of its four remaining matches. The Trojans are coming off a close 4-3 loss to UCLA last Friday, the end of a brutal four-match road trip over the last two weeks. Nonetheless, the Trojans finished their road trip 3-1, winning their first three matches against Texas, Cal and Stanford. Holding a record of 13-7, the Trojans look to make a statement as they start their last home stand this Friday against Washington.
“Everything is going pretty well,” junior Brandon Holt said. “We started off a little slower than we expected but we’re in the part of the season that counts, so all the other stuff that happened earlier is all behind us and I think we all learned from it pretty well.” 
With seven ranked singles players and one ranked doubles team, the men certainly look like a contender in the Pac-12. With that said, USC knows its best chance of winning the Pac-12 is to win out and hope the Bruins lose at least one match. 
One emerging player for the Trojans is Holt, who was recently ranked the No. 12 singles player in the nation. With one match-clinching singles win against Florida this year and earning an unprecedented two Pac-12 Player of the Week honors this season, Holt looks to carry the team as the season winds down.
“Being around such a great team, such great coaches, I think it gives you the opportunity to grow as a player and a person,” Holt said. “As far as my game goes, I think I improved in every part of my game pretty significantly.”
On the other hand, the Huskies have not had a great season. Currently last place in the Pac-12 with a 6-13 overall record, the Huskies have been struggling in both singles and doubles. With no ranked singles competitors and only one ranked doubles team (the No. 75 team of sophomore Jack Davis and senior Piers Foley), the Huskies are looking to pull a major upset when they take on the Trojans.
The women’s team has been one of the hottest in the nation, winning 12 of its last 14 matches. Holding an overall record of 16-4, the Trojans hope to go into the Pac-12 Championships on a hot streak. However, they will need to bounce back from a tough loss to Pepperdine Tuesday to do so. Head coach Alison Swain and the Trojans look to make a major turnaround when they travel to Seattle for a matchup against the Huskies.
With only three regular season matches left, the Trojans will have to play two of their last three on the road. However, the Trojans appear unfazed by this prospect as they have only two road losses on the season. 
If USC wants any chance of winning the Pac-12 title, it will have to rely on star freshman Salma Ewing. Ranked as the No. 46 singles player in the nation, Ewing has won 19 of 29 singles matches this season. Ewing was on a hot streak before losing this past Tuesday, winning her previous three singles matches. 
“We’re all building so much character and we all have so much heart, so when we go out here and fight together, we’re unbeatable,” Ewing said.
Washington’s women’s team is talented as well. With an overall record of 16-2 and a conference record of 6-1, Washington has been firing on all cylinders this season. This will not be an easy game for the Trojans, who will enter a stadium where the Huskies have lost just one match the entire season. 
The men’s tennis team hosts Washington 3 p.m. Friday, while the women’s team takes on the Huskies 1:30 p.m. Friday in Seattle.

The USC baseball team faced Cal State Fullerton Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field, rallying from behind for a gritty 6-5 victory. In the teams’ first matchup of the season, CSUF emerged victorious, 10-4.
Strong winds for most of the night meant that offense was hard to come by. 
“It’s tough that way and you know that runs will be at a premium,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said in a postgame interview on the team’s Twitter account. “You know, you’re worried that that’s going to be what causes you to lose a game.”
Neither team could get much going during the first three innings. In the first, the Trojans threatened early with a single by sophomore first baseman Jamal O’Guinn. The hit advanced junior left fielder Blake Sabol to third and O’Guinn tacked on a stolen base, but CSUF stranded the runners.
In the second and third innings, neither team could find any momentum. USC’s sophomore pitcher Brian Gursky struck out three batters in the second and pitched out of a second-and-third jam in the third. 
With the game scoreless entering the fourth inning, the Titans finally threatened with a double down the right field line that advanced junior outfielder Isaiah Garcia to third. CSUF freshman catcher Kameron Guangorena followed up with an RBI fielder’s choice to score Garcia. CSUF would come up with another fielder’s choice to push a Titan run across, making the score 2-0. 
Gursky allowed 2 runs on four hits through four innings for USC, striking out four and walking two. 
USC responded in the bottom of the inning with an RBI double to left field by freshman designated hitter Clay Owens, cutting the Titans’ lead in half. 
Sophomore pitcher John Beller came into the game in the fifth inning to relieve Gurksy. CSUF tallied two hits but failed to get back on the scoreboard in the inning, and USC went down in order.
In the sixth, the Titans threatened again with Guangorena advancing to third. However, a diving catch by junior outfielder Brady Shockey saved a run and prevented CSUF from adding to its lead. 
The Titans tacked on 2 insurance runs in the seventh frame. CSUF sophomore infielder Sahid Valenzuela beat the throw on a fielder’s choice to score and expand the Titans’ lead to 2 runs. A sacrifice bunt with two outs scored Garcia to make the game 4-1. 
Beller allowed 2 runs on four hits and two walks, striking out three through 2.2 innings, and freshman pitcher Carson Lambert finished the seventh by forcing a groundout.
Aside from a two-out walk, the Trojans couldn’t find any offense and entered the eighth down by 3 runs. 
Lambert struck out a Titan to start the eighth, but a double and a wild pitch increased the Titans’ lead to 4 runs. USC’s offense had been struggling all night and a loss seemed imminent with only one and a half innings to go, but a leadoff single by sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez sparked a comeback. 
With two more walks, USC loaded the bases with one out. Junior second baseman Tyler Pritchard and redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs hit RBI singles to pull USC within 2 runs with two outs in the inning. 
O’Guinn then delivered a clutch bases-clearing double down the third base line to put the Trojans up 6-5. O’Guinn said he wasn’t trying to do too much at the plate before coming up with the decisive hit. 
“Approach-wise, it’s all just get the next guy up to the plate,” O’Guinn said. “The more guys we get up to the plate, the more runs we score, and that’s how we win games.”
Lambert retired the Titans in order in the ninth inning to secure the victory.
O’Guinn credited the comeback effort to the players on the field, as well as the Trojan dugout. 
“Our bench guys are always loud, rowdy, into the game,” O’Guinn said. “They do just as much off the field as we do on the field so it’s really all in.”
None of USC’s pitchers were particularly dominant on Tuesday night, but they all put up sufficient performances that proved to be just enough to eke out the win. 
O’Guinn and Pritchard each collected multiple hits to contribute to the Trojans’ nine on the game. 
USC will begin a three-game weekend series against Utah on the road Thursday. The Utes have struggled so far this year and enter the series with an 8-18 record overall and an 1-11 mark in Pac-12 play. 
Thursday’s game begins at 5 p.m., and the last two games on Friday and Saturday begin at 10:30 a.m.

In the middle of a sea of Dwyane Wade praise this week, I’m going to try to skirt around the obvious topic of his retirement and focus on perhaps the greatest thing he’s done in the last seven days.
Yeah, he dropped 30 points in his final home game in Miami, but I don’t care about that. What I care about is the statement that Wade made this week, even amid the hype of his retirement, about the importance of showing love and support to his son.
Wade’s 11-year-old son Zion walked in the Miami Beach pride parade over the weekend, decked out in bright yellow and a rainbow unicorn horn. He was accompanied by Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union and his older brother Zaire, who was seen dancing throughout the parade in a rainbow headband.
Due to a pair of road games, Wade wasn’t able to attend the parade, but that didn’t stop him from showing support for his son. Throughout the day, Wade posted pictures of his entire family accompanied with loving captions like, “We support each other with Pride” and “It’s a family thing.”
There have been plenty of rumors surrounding Zion’s identity for some time now. Last month, he walked the runway in Wade’s charity fashion show, which was met with a flurry of criticism and speculation on social media when Wade shared a clip of it on his Instagram. But there is only one part of that video that really mattered — Union on her feet, shouting and hollering the entire time that Zion strutted, struck a pose and sashayed away, and Wade right next to her, cheering and proudly sharing a clip of his son “killin’ it” on the runway.
For those who aren’t LGBTQ+, it might be difficult to understand the full depth of the impact these actions have on Zion’s identity. Sure, everyone understands that it is amazing and important that Wade has acknowledged and accepted his son’s identity. It’s a vital example of a young child coming out to his father and not facing discrimination, intolerance or hate.
When most people consider the “bad” parent of an LGBTQ+ child, they think of violence. Parents who beat their children, who kill their children, who throw them out on the street or ship them away to camps. These are the parents who come to mind, of course, but this proclivity toward labeling “bad” parents as the violent and hateful ones often excludes the much wider swath of parents who damage their children simply by not accepting them.
There are plenty of ways that parents of LGBTQ+ children mute their kids’ identities. There are parents who refuse to let their children buy the clothes, wear the makeup, listen to the music, join the school clubs and watch the TV shows they love. There are parents who ignore it, hoping that silence might help make the truth go away. There are parents who say their child is too young and naive to have any idea what their sexuality might be or what their future might hold. 
And then, at the other end of the spectrum, there’s Dwyane Wade, putting his kid in a rainbow unicorn horn and telling the whole world that he’s proud of his son’s identity. Not despite his gayness, but because of it, because that part of his son’s identity makes him the whole human being that he is today.
Words can’t describe what these choices will do for Zion. Most LGBTQ+ kids grow up feeling scared either on some level or all the time. Scared that someone will find out. 
Wade is effectively doing what every parent hopes to do — he’s getting rid of the fear in his son’s life. He’s taking care of the monster hiding under the bed or, pardon the pun, in the closet. He certainly can’t remove homophobia or bigotry from Zion’s life, and at some point — if he hasn’t already — he will be forced to face a moment when he can’t shield his son from the hate of the world. 
But Wade is doing the most any parent can. He’s giving his son a safe place to rely on, a set of arms to always fall into and the guarantee that no matter how mean and horrible the world becomes, he will always have love to come home to at the end of the day.
I’m not an NBA fan, so I’m not the right person to write about Wade as a basketball player. I know that he’s a legend and that his presence will be sorely missed in the NBA. I know that what he’s done for the game is going to live on long past the end of his career.
But what I wish I could tell him instead is that his retirement will usher in the most important part of his life — the part where he gets to be a parent, first, every day. 
I’m sure it won’t be perfect. It’s hard to be a celebrity parent and even harder to be the celebrity parent of an LGBTQ+ son who has to come out under public scrutiny. None of that will be easy for Wade. But so far, I have to say, he’s getting everything right.

Aside from being a popular beach destination, Santa Monica is also home to several cafes ideal for a post-sunbathing cooldown, a sun-kissed study spot or a quick caffeine fix. Prices run slightly cheaper than downtown, and many have a stunning ocean view. Here’s a short list of coffeeshops for your next venture to the coastal city.
Bluestone Lane
631 Wilshire Blvd.
Santa Monica, CA 90401
Hours: 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily
The Grind: An Australian coffee shop, Bluestone Lane has slowly opened locations along the East and West Coasts, rivaling Blue Bottle in its international presence. It offers coffee bean subscriptions online, and is known for its “flat whites,” served in iconic blue cups.
The Cream: Bluestone is much more than a coffee shop — its menu includes cocktails and beers as well as a variety of toasts. The front outdoor seating features a wall that displays rows of potted plants, and its location next to a park also provides a burst of greenery.
The Roast: Though the cafe’s light wood furnishings lend it an open atmosphere, its backless benches can get very uncomfortable after a few hours. The table and chair height ratios aren’t ergonomically conducive, either, and regulars can be seen hunched over laptops.
Sidecar Doughnuts & Coffee
631 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90401
Hours: Monday — Thursday: 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.Friday — Saturday: 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Sunday: 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The Grind: More of a donut shop than a cafe, Sidecar offers fresh and novel offerings all day, changing their menu up regularly. Donuts are baked throughout the day in small batches. Beyond standard coffee offerings, the beverage menu is limited, but on the cheaper end — a latte runs only $4.25 here.
The Cream: Nothing goes better with a strong cup of black coffee than a freshly baked donut. Sidecar also excels in presentation — its bright white donut boxes are ornamented with its logo in gold calligraphy. Donuts ordered “for dine-in” are laid on asymmetrical white plates.
The Roast: Because of the nature of small batch baking, some donuts don’t quite hit baking standards, and some customers are served slightly under or over baked donuts. However, the staff is very accommodating, and subpar donuts are readily replaced with new ones.

Mental health is often regarded as a taboo topic — there’s not only a stigma surrounding the validity of mental illnesses and the value of therapy, but also many difficulties that can come with having conversations about wellness. Podcasts, however, offer an intimate space for personal storytelling and open discussion. These four audio shows serve to normalize mental health and teach lessons about improving wellness in daily life. 

Terrible, Thanks for Asking 
Nora McInerny knows what it is like to deal with grief. In late 2014, she miscarried her second child. Just five days later, her father died of cancer. And six weeks after that, her husband also lost his battle to cancer. 
Her podcast “Terrible, Thanks for Asking” starts with her personal story of loss and mourning as she approaches the two-year anniversary of her husband’s death in 2016. She talks about raising a son who will grow up without any memories of his father, the confusing process of finding love after loss and how grief brought laughter as often as  it brought tears. 
In each episode, McInerny explores a guest’s experience with trauma, mental illness or loss through narrative storytelling and interviews. McInerny’s writing is earnest and perceptive, but she also brings levity and hope to every conversation — as much as the episodes are about dealing with intense emotions and experiences, they’re also about finding support, community and happiness beyond those experiences. 
The podcast isn’t afraid to find the intersections between mental health issues and conversations in the national news. Most recently, it featured a three-episode arc about the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Penn., which discussed how tragedy affects a community. 

The Hilarious World of Depression
In the cold open for every episode of “The Hilarious World of Depression,” host John Moe asks his comedian guests, “Is depression funny?” 
His guest on the first episode — Peter Sagal, host of the NPR news comedy quiz show “Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me” — answers in a way that effectively sums up the conceit of Moe’s podcast: “I think it’s funny in the way that death is funny in that it’s not, but you cope with it by laughing.”
Moe, a humorist and depressive himself, interviews a comedian who has been dealing with depression on each episode. Comedians are storytellers at heart. The ability to find humor in mental health issues, especially given their negative stigma, is vital to advancing conversations surrounding depression that provide positive tools for support and encouragement. 
Mental health can often be something of an enigma, and “The Hilarious World of Depression” serves to make it less mysterious by exploring individual experiences in ways that are approachable and honest. 
The podcast can be comforting for those dealing with depression, but it’s perhaps even more important for individuals to best understand what their depressed friends or colleagues are going through. 

Invisibilia
This NPR podcast, hosted by psychology reporters Alix Spiegel and Hanna Rosin, approaches mental health and human behavior from a scientific perspective. “Invisibilia,” Latin for “invisible things,” dives headfirst into the often frustratingly invisible aspects of mental health by marrying fascinating human stories with logic-based brain science. 
The stories “Invisibilia” tells often feel like they’re taken from a science fiction novel — on the episode “Fearless,” the hosts explore the case of a woman who, psychologically, cannot feel fear. On the episode “The Remote Control Brain,” they chronicle the tale of a woman who was part of a psychiatric trial where doctors implanted a device in her brain to help her moderate her severe mental illness, giving her the ability to control her mood at any time with the click of a button. 
While the stories are often at the edge of human possibility and scientific wonder, they have implications for daily life. “Fearless” offers approaches to removing fear from one’s own life, while “The Remote Control Brain” discusses simple ways individuals can manage their  daily mood. 
The audio format serves “Invisibilia” well — through artistic sound design, Rosin and Spiegel are able to give life to those “invisible things.”

Happier with Gretchen Rubin
Mental health is about more than just dealing with anxiety, depression or other illnesses. “Happier” offers everyday self-care and mindfulness strategies aimed at increasing happiness. Host Gretchen Rubin is an expert in human happiness — she’s written multiple books on the topic and brings a humor and clarity to wellness communication that makes her a perfect podcast host. 
The podcast is refreshingly simple — each episode is a conversation between Rubin and her sister Elizabeth Craft, with segments like “Try This at Home” and “Happiness Hack.” 
Rubin and Craft share the kind of chemistry that only exists between sisters, and both have a sense of childlike enthusiasm that bolsters the show. Because “Happier” forgoes the sometimes pedantic and overly produced nature of many podcasts today, just listening to the relaxing, slow-paced show is a form of mindful self-care on its own. 
The atmosphere of simplicity the show creates carries into its content — “Happier” never asks you to make major life changes or present grand gestures. It’s all about incorporating self-awareness through effortless practices, like allowing oneself to enjoy moments of complete silence or taking time to delete apps from your phone that are more detrimental than beneficial.

I am writing this to honor Nipsey Hussle, the entrepreneur and rapper who was murdered last week outside of his clothing shop The Marathon Clothing in South Los Angeles. 
Hussle first opened Marathon Clothing with plans to expand across the country. Recognizing that black culture is one of the most profitable in this country — whose benefits are most often reaped by white people — he had plans to vertically integrate hip-hop to inspire artists to follow suit and gain more control over their content.
The moment I heard he had died, I, like many others, was stunned. I thought to myself — Here was someone who was dedicating his life to serving others. Someone who had stayed in his community after finding success. Here was someone who was doing this for the culture, who was leading the next wave of black entrepreneurs and innovators. 
Hussle was a role model. Too often, rappers get rich and leave; they sell out to the mainstream and let white people in suits make billions off black culture.
Hussle was against that — he was for the culture.
“He was a protector and wanted us to be our best at all times,” his longtime girlfriend Lauren London told the Los Angeles Times. “He was a truth seeker and a truth speaker.” 
Nipsey Hussle opened The Marathon Store in June 17 2017. Fans had lined up around the shop and Big Boy from REAL 92.3 hosted the event. I remember seeing the photos in XXL magazine of Nipsey smiling as he used big ceremonial scissors to cut the red ribbon.
“The whole city’s going to be out,” Hussle said in an interview with Power 106. “We’re going to have jumpers for the kids — games, giveaways. It’s going to be like a carnival on Crenshaw and Slauson.” 
Hussle considered The Marathon to be a “smartstore” because of its various technological accomplishments including a smartphone app, which allowed for customers to access exclusive content. The app was designed by a 20-year-old named Iddris Sandu, who Hussle had met in Starbucks. 
“My daughter tells me to pull into Starbucks on the way to the movie,” he said in an interview with Billboard magazine. “I’m thinking, ‘They got snacks at the movie theatre,’ but she’s telling me she wants a Unicorn frap, so I’m like, ‘OK, fine.’ [There,] we met Iddris.” 
The two spoke about the ways in which they could fuse technology into a brick-and-mortar shop. This was the future of retail, they believed. 
This was the future of hip-hop. 
“It was crazy and by chance,” Hussle said in the same interview. “But I don’t think it was on accident.”
It took three weeks for Sandu to build the app. Later, Hussle named him the store’s chief technology officer. 
Hussle wanted to combine physical and digital spaces to create a unique experience for his customers. He wanted to open “smartstores” across the country, in places like New York and San Francisco; each location holding a different retail philosophy, each providing a one-of-a-kind experience for their communities. In curtailing the middleman distributors such as iTunes and YouTube, Hussle and his co-owners would be able to profit from their own products and their exclusive content.
“The goal is to be an urban Sanrio,” he told Billboard. “Sanrio is a $5 billion-dollar company. These are content characters that exist in the screen first, and real world products were created around it … We haven’t seen that in hip-hop. We haven’t seen someone create a real world place where the brand lives and there’s products.” 
In other words, Hussle was the future of hip-hop. The business of black music, though rooted in our artistic abilities, has always been exploited and used to generate profit for those who are outside of our community. Hussle wanted our communities to reap the benefits of our culture. He was a black entrepreneur with a clear vision of the future, whose innovative ideas had the potential to change the hip hop industry; whose innovative ideas could have changed the world. 
“We want to be able to deliver our products that we own 100% to a retail experience we curate and control in an environment that is strategically designed to create an experience that’s engineered,” he told Billboard. “This is us trying to disrupt retail, create theme park for the brand … I think we’re in the process of seeing technology integrated with everything … We want to be one of the leaders.”
My favorite thing about Nipsey Hussle was that he always made sure to add his community into the narratives of his dreams. There was a quality about him, where no matter how successful he became, one could always see that he would never leave black people behind. He was the image of the modern day black entrepreneur who was doing everything right — doing everything we’ve always told young black children to do. 
To grow up, and to dream. 
His memorial will be held Thursday morning at the Staples Center.

In contrast to other private universities, USC upholds transfer applicants, particularly those from community colleges, as an integral part of its admissions process. The nearly 1,500 transfer students bring diverse sets backgrounds and experiences that enrich the University’s academic environment to campus. 
Though USC’s emphasis on admitting transfer students is commendable and should serve as a blueprint for other private institutions, the University still needs to make a concerted effort to prioritize first-generation college students and other structurally disadvantaged communities in the transfer admissions process.
In the 2018 admissions cycle, USC accepted 2,338 transfer applicants, 1,448 of whom enrolled at the University for the Fall 2018 semester. This pool of transfer applicants  encompassed about 22% of students USC admitted during the cycle and just under 30% of the total new enrollees last fall. Forty nine percent of 2018’s class of transfer students comprised students from California Community Colleges. These 1,448 transfer student enrollees represent 330 different prior institutions.
Granted, comparable private research institutions have not prioritized transfer student admission as much as USC has. Last year, Stanford University admitted a total of 20 transfer students to campus, according to its admissions data. Although Stanford already admits fewer students each year than USC does, transfers only comprised 1% of Stanford’s admitted student pool — compared to the 22% admitted to USC. Ivy League schools are particularly stingy when it comes to admitting transfer applicants. Last year, Princeton University granted admission to 13 transfer applicants after two decades of not accepting a single one. Harvard, Brown and Dartmouth each enrolled fewer than 100 transfer students last fall.
Criticism of USC’s comparatively generous transfer admissions policy primarily stems from the fact that the University only admits a large pool of transfer applicants as a means of artificially deflating its first-year admissions rate — the only metric of selectivity taken into account by U.S. News & World Report and other high-profile college ranking publications. USC limits the number of spots designated for incoming freshmen and keeps about one-third of the available spots open for a large group of transfer students.
But a close look at the statistics reveals that admitted transfer students have qualifications comparable with the rest of the student body, demonstrating their potential to successfully transition into USC academic life. 
The mean GPA of transfer student enrollees is 3.7 average for college-level course work. As a point of comparison, the mid-50% GPA of first-year student enrollees is 3.7 to 3.97 for high school-level course work. Although USC’s 24% admission rate for transfer students in 2018 was markedly higher than its 13% admission rate for first-year students during the same admissions cycle, the 24% transfer admissions rate is lower than the general admissions rates of Wake Forest University, Boston College and University of Rochester.
According to USC’s annual reports, transfer students thrive academically after they arrive at USC. The USC transfer student graduation rate is 92% — the same as the graduation rate of rest of the student body.
But the University’s divergent, paradigm-shattering transfer admissions process must aspire to carry a higher purpose than merely filling spots with academically competent students and lowering admission rates on paper. 
USC can do more to ensure that the transfer admissions process lives up to the vision laid out in a Washington Post editorial by former USC President C. L. Max Nikias that the University should “[offer] a second chance to community college graduates” to render it “a place for the most talented, whoever they are and wherever they may come from, to come together and cultivate their strengths.”
The first-generation college student transfer acceptance rate has declined from 44% in 2013 to 28% in 2018. Legacy students outnumber first-generation students within the Fall 2018 transfer class, 30% to 28%. The primary function of USC’s transfer admissions process must be to provide opportunities for students who, due to socioeconomic factors or other extenuating circumstances, were not ideal candidates coming out of high school. With necessary reforms, USC can cement its status as a top-tier private research university leading efforts to reduce inequality and expand opportunity through transfer admissions.

Vagrants, tramps and hobos — when it comes to labeling the over 52,000 people across Los Angeles County who lack access to stable housing, stigmatizing and dehumanizing rhetoric never fails to publicly manifest itself, whether in town halls or even in the halls of seats of power.
But these past years provide hope that a silent majority doesn’t want to criminalize homelessness or vilify those experiencing poverty and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. With the passage of Proposition HHH, a 2016 ballot measure approved by over 75% of voters that would generate $1.2 billion to pay for affordable housing construction coupled with the accompanying Measure H, which provides funding for ongoing services, Angelenos twice signaled their financial commitment to helping those worst hit by this severe housing crisis. And even with a rejuvenated Not In My Backyard movement, a recent United Way of Greater Los Angeles survey found 69% of respondents support permanent supportive housing in their communities.
But L.A. would be delusional if it believed that a few elections could turn the tide in the humanitarian crisis for those who are forced to live in the streets. The roots of both the problem and the solution lie in language, which forms ideologies that inform policy.
Our fundamental framing, and implicit diagnosis, of homelessness remains as broken as the systems which are set in place to exacerbate housing insecurity. Most dialogue centers around terms such as “the homeless” and “homeless people,” phrases which both recognize the difference before the person and treat entire populations as monoliths in a dehumanizing fashion.
The University of Maryland recommends, “instead of calling someone ‘homeless,’ you would refer to them as ‘a person experiencing homelessness.” This is called person-first language.’ This reframing not only reaffirms human dignity but also addresses homelessness as situational rather than as a defining condition.
Ultimately, homelessness represents a state of being that any American can experience. A 2017 study by Zillow, an online real estate database company, reported that a 5% rise in rent could translate into 2,000 more Angelenos living on the streets, revealing the precarious financial situation of thousands in L.A. Nationally, the Federal Reserve Board found that four in 10 Americans couldn’t come up with $400 in an unexpected emergency, meaning that a hospital bill or rent spike could potentially push millions of Americans from homes to the streets.
At any given time, 552,830 Americans experience homelessness. Each year, because of the broken social safety net, health care, veteran services, mental health and foster youth systems, countless individuals and families bounce from homes to shelters or to the streets, with thousands stuck in a cycle of unstable housing for prolonged periods of time, now referred to as the experience of chronic homelessness, raising the question of why we condemn vulnerable populations instead of the public policies that have and continue to fail them.
The responsibility then falls onto each member of the community to refuse to minimize the moral urgency of homelessness and to equip themselves with the vocabulary to support people and policies that move people that are experiencing homelessness into homes. Words matter and inclusivity matters. Movements arose to change the narratives surrounding disability and immigration — it’s time to reframe the dialogue on homelessness.

Actress and assistant professor Alexandra Billings announced on March 13 via Instagram the launch of a scholarship for LGBTQ+ students applying to the School of Dramatic Arts. 
“I am overwhelmed and profoundly moved by this honor,” Billings wrote in her Instagram post. “As a 56-year-old mixed-race trans woman living with AIDS since the mid-1980s and having survived on the streets of Chicago as a sex worker, a heroin addict and being homeless for almost a year and a half, this sits in a place in my spirit that is truly humbling.”
Billings, who has been acting for over 40 years and has performed in live productions and is known for her guest appearances on “How To Get Away With Murder” and “Grey’s Anatomy.” She also played Davina on the Golden Globe-winning show “Transparent.” According to the SDA website, Billings is also one of the first transgender actresses to play a transgender character on television. She has been recognized with five After Dark Awards and the Rainbow Spirit Award.
According to its fundraising website, Billings hopes the scholarship will send a message to the LGBTQ+ community that they belong at USC.
“[This scholarship] sends a clear message that the LGBT community is here and that they matter,” the fundraising website read. “It reaches out to young LGBT Americans searching for artistic expansion.”
Yahm Steinberg, a freshman majoring in theatre who identifies as pansexual, said she believes this scholarship will help queer members of the theater community feel validated. 
In 2018, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation  found that 8.8% of regular television characters identified as LGBTQ+.
“Even if you’re not gay, [you’re] being exposed to stories of people who are,” Kleinberg said. “Gay people are forced to conform to heteronormativity all the time, and I think it’s really cool that [this scholarship] is starting to break that idea [and] celebrate people in [these] communities.” 
Billings is hosting a fundraising show May 1 at the Bing Theatre called “I’m Still Queer: A TransAmerican Cabaret.” At the time of publication, the scholarship has raised more than $10,000.
Samantha Ruzon, a freshman majoring in theatre and political science, said she is worried about students applying to the scholarship who have not yet come out as part of the LGBTQ+ community. 
“That’s the difficult thing,” Ruzon said. “If [the student] gets [the scholarship], they shouldn’t have to advertise that.” 
SDA Dean David Bridel said the cabaret concert is the most fitting way to fundraise for this scholarship because of Billing’s background performing in cabarets.
“In addition to being a passionate advocate for the LGBT community, Alexandra Billings is one of the country’s great cabaret performers,” Bridel wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It is especially fitting that [SDA] should choose to present her work in this format, as cabaret has always been a place to give voice to individuals and communities who have a vital message for society.”

Attorney and USC professor Jonathan Kotler filed a suit Tuesday against the California Department of Motor Vehicles after his personalized license plate application was denied over fears that the acronym could carry racist connotations.
According to the complaint obtained by the Daily Trojan, Kotler, an associate professor of journalism at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, applied for a vanity plate with the acronym “COYW,” which stands for “Come on You Whites.” He said the phrase is a reference to his favorite British soccer team Fulham FC, which is nicknamed the Whites. 
Kotler is getting represented by attorney Wen Fa of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit that defends and promotes civil liberties, according to its website.
“Kotler applied for a license plate … and the Department of Motor Vehicles denied the license plate because it was offensive and had racial connotations,” Wa said. “Kotler submitted a bunch of documents that showed the slogan was a commonly used slogan by NBC, by the team, and had no racial connotations whatsoever.”
California DMV director Kathleen Webb is named as a defendant in the complaint, which alleges the department violated Kotler’s civil rights and that the decision was “absurd,” “unfair” and “biased.”
“I think this case highlights arbitrary government action, and when you give the government broad authority to ban things it deems offensive, it is going to make decisions that are arbitrary, biased and wrong,” Wa said. 
Kotler, a trial and appellate attorney who argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in the City of Riverside v. Rivera case, believes the DMV’s decision is a violation of the First amendment, Wa said. 
“Kotler is someone who wants to stand up for his constitutional rights, his First amendments of free speech,” Wa said. “And frankly, he doesn’t think that the department should falsely accuse him of being a racist just because he wants to support a soccer team.”
According to the complaint, California law allows individuals to submit applications for “special interest” license plates. However, the DMV may refuse to issue a license plate that may carry connotations that are offensive or indecent. 
According to UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, in an interview with LA Magazine, the DMV decision discriminates against speech based on viewpoint. Volokh said banning vulgarities is viewpoint neutral, but banning offensive material is viewpoint based.
“Those criteria include a configuration containing ‘an insulting or degrading term,’ a configuration with a term considered ‘repulsive,’ or a configuration with ‘a negative connotation to a specific group,’ the complaint read.

The Undergraduate Student Government proposed the creation of an ad hoc committee to redesign the organization’s current logo in Tuesday’s Senate meeting, due to its similarity to a neo-Nazi party logo. 
According to USG Senior Director of Communications Truman Fritz, former co-Chief Diversity Officer Shany Ebadi noted that the current USG logo is similar to the logo of The Third Path, a German far-right group founded in 2013. The current USG logo was introduced between 2005 and 2006, according to Fritz.
“As a diverse and inclusive organization, we want to stray as far away from that as possible,” said Fritz, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It’s totally counterintuitive to our mission now as representatives of this 20,000 [person] undergraduate student body who’s made up of all these different communities.”
During the meeting, the second of the new USG administration, Fritz proposed the creation of the committee, which would include President Trenton Stone, Vice President Mahin Tahsin, Chief Diversity Officer Jeffrey Cho, Fritz and several members of the USG marketing and graphics teams. 
In the proposal, Fritz presented a potential timeline for the redesign process if the Senate were to approve of the committee’s creation. According to Fritz, the USG graphics team has already created multiple redesign proposals. Fritz intends for the proposed committee to finalize marketing orders for items that will include the new logo.
“We’re going to be thinking about themes, thinking about ideas, thinking about what we want the logo to represent within the organization and how it comes into this whole expansion of our visual identity,” Fritz said.
Fritz said the logo redesign proposal comes with USG’s broader initiative to rebrand its image and expand communication to get more students involved with USG and its various initiatives. 
Later, Stone announced Nillani Anandakugan, who previously served as the co-director of elections & recruitment, as his candidate for the chief of staff position. According to Stone, Dylan Field, the assistant director of elections and recruitment in 2018-19, was the original choice for the chief of staff position but turned it down due to other time commitments.
Senators will vote on Anandakugan’s hiring in addition to the logo redesign committee proposal next Tuesday.
“I’m just really honored that Trenton, Mahin [and] the rest of the [executives] thought of me as someone who could take on this position,” said Anandakugan, a junior majoring in global health and environmental science and health. “Dylan really had this great vision of what he imagined for advocacy, and I hope I can do just as well.”
Cho was also unanimously voted as USG’s new chief diversity officer for the 2019-20 term.

“Fuller House” actress Lori Loughlin and 15 other parents involved in the college admissions bribery scheme now face new charges, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Tuesday. Over two dozen lawyers who represent some of the parents named in the investigation wrote a letter to a U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts claiming the court used improper “judge shopping” techniques to impact the cases.
Thirteen of the 16 parents were indicted in relation with USC for with conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering conspiracy after allegedly paying bribes to help their children cheat on college entrance exams and falsely pose as athletic recruits to universities like USC, UCLA, Yale and Stanford University. 
Parents allegedly sent payments through businessman William “Rick” Singer’s Edge College & Career Network and some transferred money into the United States from outside, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Singer pleaded guilty in federal court March 12.
Bill McGlashan, who tried to pay for his son’s admission into USC as a fake football recruit, is one of the parents named in the second indictment. In his March 29 hearing, McGlashan’s attorneys presented documents saying that McGlashan’s son withdrew his college applications as he is still in high school. 
“The Prosecutor’s case against Mr. McGlashan is deeply flawed and ignores important exculpatory facts,” McGlashan’s lawyer John Hueston wrote in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to presenting his side of the story.” 
The parents were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Those charged may be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, and parents may have to pay up to $500,000 in fines depending on the federal district court judge, according to the press release.
Earlier Tuesday, 27 lawyers representing parents named in the investigation who have not pleaded guilty sent a letter to Chief Judge Patti Saris in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. The court subverted the random judge selection process by assigning all of the indicted parents to a case where a judge was already assigned.
The lawyers also wrote that each defendant should individually be assigned to a judge rather than being grouped with the same judge. 
“The prosecutor’s charging plan, if permitted, would do severe and lasting damage to the district’s random assignment system,” the lawyers wrote. “Prosecutors who seek to evade the district’s assignment system by joining more than a dozen new defendants into a previously returned indictment that happened to be assigned to a district judge that the prosecutors prefer should not be rewarded.” 
While the lawyers asked Saris to have their clients randomly assigned, the prosecutors assigned the 16 parents facing the second indictment to an already pending case presided by Judge Nathaniel Gorton shortly after the letter was sent. 
U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling responded to Saris, calling the defense lawyers’ concerns “inappropriate and disingenuous.” Lelling wrote that because all of the parents worked with Singer in the alleged scheme, placing them as co-conspirators in the indictments and under one judge is routine practice. 
While the lawyers wrote in their letter that they “deeply respect” Gorton, Lelling wrote that they likely are challenging the selection because they want a more favorable judge. 
“What counsel fail to say — but of course mean — is that they want a different judge because they perceive Judge Gorton as imposing longer sentences in criminal cases than other judges in this district,” Lelling wrote. “If this matter had been drawn to a judge viewed as more favorable to the defense, counsel would not have sent the letter.”       
The second indictment comes a day after two USC parents and 11 other parents agreed to plead guilty for their alleged involvement in the college bribery scheme. According to the press release, an arraignment date has not been set.

Each one of USC’s 19,000 undergraduates has a story to tell. The Daily Trojan, USC’s independent student newspaper, recently spoke with three of them — an aspiring lawyer and DREAMer, a self-made engineer from Côte d’Ivoire and a first-generation screenwriter — in the wake of the college admissions scandal.
Over the last two years, USC has been in the national spotlight, most recently with its heavy involvement in the alleged bribery scheme. This revelation failed to surprise yet hurt students, and journalists across the country have rarely hesitated to label us the “University of Spoiled Children.” 
The New York Times is no different.
On April 3, The Times published an article titled “What’s Life Like as a Student at U.S.C.? Depends on the Size of Your Bank Account,” written by USC alumna and former Daily Trojan editor-in-chief Jennifer Medina. In the article, Medina incorporated interviews with four students from varying economic backgrounds to “show how difficult it is to navigate a university that tries to be a home for all.” 
Medina’s superficial attempt to portray USC’s economic inequality failed to include any students who overcame some of the steepest possible challenges — hunger and homelessness, to name a few — to attend USC. And since Medina chose to quote three students from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism — the same school she attended and has guest lectured at — it’s no wonder her article barely scratched the surface of students’ realities.
The generalizations presented in this article are damaging. Making assumptions about an entire University, one with 4,000 Pell Grant recipients and students from over 130 countries, only reinforces the harmful stereotypes that isolate marginalized students in the first place.
Medina repeatedly acknowledged that USC is not unique in its economic disparities. And it’s true — according to data the Times published, when compared to its peer institutions, USC lands right in the middle. Fourteen percent of students at USC are from the top 1%, placing it 34th on a list of 65 elite public and private institutions.
If USC is not unique in this regard, why write the article in the first place?
USC’s myriad scandals have, for many, illuminated the underlying corruption that has plagued this campus for too long. But USC is also 47,500 students large, and the exorbitant wealth that made the scheme possible is only reflective of the select families who engaged in the crimes. 
But that is not what Medina gleaned from her reporting. She did not incorporate any knowledge of USC today, perhaps only backing her reporting with her experiences as a Trojan over 15 years ago, and it showed. 
USC is not perfect. There is class disparity, a lack of resources for marginalized students and continuous mistrust of senior administrators. But a shallow report that further imposes stereotypes that are not unique to USC keeps us from moving toward the change so many of us desire. 
“And yet, as the bribery cases have made clear, the campus remains a place of pervasive wealth, where celebrity, money and status are still a part of daily life,” Medina wrote. 
What daily life? What celebrities? For many USC students, “daily life” includes going to class, working a full-time job, attending extracurriculars and making time for recreation — let alone three meals a day. 
What’s life like as a student at USC? This is what life is like.

You’re in line at Trader Joe’s, admiring all the lovely sustainable goods you’ve purchased. The cashier scans your sustainably-crafted bottle of wine, vegan cream cheese and organic grapes. You can’t wait to wrap your leftovers in your new beeswax cloth because you’re too #woke to use tupperware or cling wrap. 
“Do you need a bag?” the Hawaiian shirt-wearing cashier asks you. 
Well, do you? Do you take a paper bag? Or do you desperately try to shove your purchases into your already-overfilled backpack? 
In a perfect world — or at least my perfect world — I can fit everything I bought into my backpack. But, there are times when my appetite outweighs my need to go bagless, and I give in. I feel guilty — sometimes so much so that I’ll buy a Trader Joe’s tote on the spot. I could always use more totes. Sometimes I opt for the paper bag and still feel guilty. At least I feel a bit better knowing I paid a good $0.10 for that paper bag. And hey, it’s a paper bag, which we all agreed is better for the environment than plastic, right?
Maybe not. 
California was the first state to enact a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, and issued a 10-cent fee for reusable plastic and paper bags. 
The logic behind this was to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable bags when shopping, reducing the amount of single-use plastic bags, and in turn decreasing our collective carbon footprint. 
I’m not going to make an argument that single-use plastic bags are the way to go. But I am going to offer some interesting facts that certainly shocked my environmental heart.
In 2007, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom conducted an exhaustive study trying to answer the question, “Paper or plastic?” It offered some surprising results. 
The study compared different types of plastic bags, including single-use and reinforced plastic bags that are meant to be reused, as well as paper bags and cotton bags. 
The study found that paper bags would have to be reused three times to ensure that they have a lower global warming potential than a single-use plastic bag that is not reused at all. On the other hand, cotton bags would have to be reused 131 times. 
Suddenly, having nearly 40 totes feels very wasteful and bad for the environment. 
This isn’t to say that you should toss your totes and start using single-use plastic bags. Plastic bags are still awful for the environment. Most recycling facilities can’t handle the small bags because they clog up the plant’s machinery. The main problem with plastic bags is that they often float out of proper waste streams and into nature, mainly the ocean, because of their lightness. 
In November, a dead sperm whale washed ashore in Indonesia. As National Geographic reported, the whale “had consumed a horrifying collection of plastic trash, including 115 drinking cups, 25 plastic bags, plastic bottles, two flip-flops and a bag containing more than 1,000 pieces of string.”
The main consideration in the debate of paper, plastic or cotton bags is to reuse whichever bag as much as possible. Plastic bags can be used as trash can liners. Unbleached paper bags can be recycled or composted, since they’re made out of organic materials. Cotton bags can be reused for purposes other than carrying groceries. 
Remembering to bring a bag with you wherever you go — be it paper, plastic or cotton — is critical to reducing our environmental impact. Better yet, buy in bulk and shop less!

USC beach volleyball is looking to capitalize on its successful season when it faces two dominant opponents in No. 9 Long Beach State and Pepperdine at home Thursday.
The Trojans are coming off a successful run in the Pac-12 North Invitational last Sunday. USC defeated No. 12 Cal, No. 20 Stanford, No. 1 UCLA and Washington to finish 4-0 in the tournament. The victory over the Bruins was especially noteworthy, as USC handed UCLA its first loss of the season.
“We were prepared and came in with a lot of knowledge on the other teams,” head coach Anna Collier said. “We had a good beat on them and what we were going to try to accomplish.”
USC has been successful at the top court, as senior Abril Bustamante and sophomore Tina Graudina consistently outplayed opponents in the recent invitational. The duo will look to carry over its strong play into Thursday’s matchups, although the Trojans are hoping for consistency from all teammates as these games may be decided by narrow margins.
“We really want to nail down the basics,” senior Terese Cannon said. “[These games] are our last opportunity to prove ourselves before the Pac-12 championship.”
Long Beach State will come into this contest with a two-game winning streak as it easily defeated CSUN and UC Davis. The team swept both opponents and remains the ninth-best team in the nation. However, the Trojans have defeated Long Beach State in all of their past six matchups.
As the fifth-ranked team, Pepperdine will prove to be even more of a test for the Trojans. The Waves defeated Stanford and USC in their most recent games, bringing its overall record to 16-6. The Trojans and Waves are currently split in the season series at 1-1, and both games have been decided by one set. This final matchup will be a major benchmark for the squad as Pepperdine is projected to be the toughest opponent that the Trojans will face for the remainder of the regular season.
With only four total games remaining, the Trojans look to finish the season strong before competing in the playoffs. USC will take on the 49ers at 1 p.m. and the Waves at 3 p.m. Thursday.

For many college students, four years of school can seem to fly by quickly. For student-athletes, grueling workouts, travel and the rigors of competing at the Division I level can make it go by even quicker. In this series, the Daily Trojan sits down with senior athletes playing various sports at USC to discuss their experience over the past four years, from their athletic life to their academic life. This week’s senior is Abril Bustamante, a captain on the women’s beach volleyball team and an All-American. 
Q: What is your favorite memory at USC?
There’s definitely so many to choose from. I have to say without a doubt my sophomore year, winning the national championship. That was just insane because it was 13-15 in the third set. Nerves were up. It was a close game, and just the energy … It was so exciting, it was unreal.
I remember we all raced down to the ocean … We all dove in. I remember just feeling so happy. The happiest I’ve ever felt. The team was awesome. We had a great coaching staff, great everything. It was just a perfect end to a perfect year.
Q: Do you have any regrets from the past four years?
There are definitely games I wish I would have won, or maybe change in that moment. But looking back and seeing where I am now, I don’t think there’s anything I would change because I am here, and I’m happy with the way college has gone so far and my experience. Even the losses have set me up for the future. Learning for them, I’ve learned more from the losses than anything else. 
Q: What’s one thing about beach volleyball that most people don’t know?
That in college it’s not played with bathing suits? I don’t know. The question I get asked a lot is if we play 6-on-6 and it’s just doubles, so maybe that. 
Q: What’s next for you?
Next year, I’m going to graduate school. After that, I don’t know. I’m taking it one day at a time for now. 
Q: Do you have any advice for freshman athletes?
I would tell them to make a lot of friends, don’t be afraid to make mistakes or ask for help, and just to try to live without regrets. The worst thing is you wish you could’ve done more, or you wish you could’ve changed things. 
Q: What have you had to sacrifice in order to be a student-athlete? 
Definitely family time. There’s times where I’ve wanted to go home and see my family and I can’t because I have practices. Friend get-togethers, just little things, even missing classes for athletic events. It’s definitely a lot of sacrifices. But at the end of the day, looking back at four years, everything I’ve done has been worth it. I would take nothing back and I would do it all over again if I could.  
Q: What is your schedule like?
Now that I’m a second semester senior, my classload is pretty light, which is awesome. I wake up really early. I’ll either do some homework in the morning, or I’ll go straight to Galen Center. 11 a.m. to 12 p.m., we’ll either have weights or conditioning at McKay Center. Around 12:30 p.m., we’ll start practice until 3 p.m. After practice, we’ll do either some rehab or just hang out. I also go to bed pretty early — like, very, very early.

No scandals. That should be the primary job requirement for the athletic director of the University of Southern California. He or she can be a member of the Trojan Family or have never set foot on Trousdale Parkway. They just need to avoid the dreaded “s-word” that seems to plague the University at every turn. 
Yet under Athletic Director Lynn Swann, who took up the mantle from Pat Haden in April 2016, there’s been scandal after scandal after scandal in USC Athletics — and few victories to match. 
Last fall, USC football’s downward spiral culminated in the program’s first losing season since 2000. Even the undermanned, bowl-banned Trojans under Lane Kiffin never finished worse than a 7-6 record. Yet, Swann voiced his support for Helton following the trainwreck of the season, likely saving face after extending Helton’s contract until 2023 the previous offseason. 
The athletics department looked to be righting the ship, making a move to hire wunderkind Kliff Kingsbury as offensive coordinator. But of course, all those glitters would never coach for the cardinal and gold. Kingsbury left quickly after to become the Arizona Cardinals’ head coach. The Cardinals only had to pay USC a $150,000 buyout to land Kingsbury. I’d like to think they asked Swann, “Cash or check?” 
In 2017, USC basketball embarrassingly lost in the second round of the National Invitational Tournament. This was perhaps understandable, as the team was coming off as a major snub from the NCAA Tournament. But this season, USC missed the tournament for the second consecutive year with no argument for getting to the Big Dance. And not to mention — former assistant coach Tony Bland pled guilty to bribery and wire fraud in January, basically admitting he facilitated payments to recruits. The NCAA has yet to punish schools involved in that scandal, but they will. And when they do? Yeesh. 
Of course, USC football and basketball don’t make up the entire athletic department (even though they bring in most of the dough). USC’s men’s and women’s water polo teams have been the crown jewels of Swann’s tenure. The women’s team has won two of the last three national championships and the men’s team took one home last fall. 
But in March, the water polo program went from national powerhouse to national embarrassment. Legendary coach Jovan Vavic (of both the men’s and women’s teams) was indicted for allegedly taking bribes to lie about recruits in the now-infamous, Aunt Becky Admissions Scandal. The school fired Vavic immediately, ending his 16-time national championship tenure. So much for Swann’s crown jewel.
Not all of the aforementioned scandals or mishaps are directly Swann’s fault. But he certainly bears responsibility for the admissions disaster. His department clearly lacked oversight over athlete admissions and failed to properly vet recruits. Swann’s response to the scandal was more uninspiring than a Steve Sarkisian speech at a booster event. 
“I think everybody was blindsided by this,” Swann said to the Los Angeles Times. “The fact that it was a senior member of the staff and also our men’s and women’s head water polo coach. … These are people that have been here a long time and people who had been here during difficult times. Everyone was completely shocked, caught offguard and taken by surprise.”
Everyone was also shocked, caught offguard and taken by surprise when they found out Swann still had a job in the wake of recent events. (Also why use basically the same, identical and alike phrase three times in a row? I mean it’s not like he was trying to reach a word count, but I digress.) 
When Swann took over after Haden’s resignation in 2016, the program had successfully moved beyond NCAA sanctions stemming from the Reggie Bush, pay-for-play scandal. At the time, the program’s biggest embarrassment was retaining Sarkesian after he spoke drunkenly at that booster event in August 2016. Now the department is staring sanctions straight in the face, from multiple incidents, and they’ve almost all happened under Swann’s purview. 
Swann also told the Times that he wanted to be USC’s athletic director for the next 10 years. For an administrator whose hardly gone 10 minutes without a public relations nightmare, I’d pump the brakes a bit.

After the final buzzer of every USC lacrosse game — home or away — dozens of children flock to Katie DeFeo, a sophomore attacker on the women’s lacrosse team. The catch: DeFeo rarely steps on the field.
Sidelined during her sophomore year of high school due to injury, DeFeo looked for ways to impact her team off the field. Filming on the GoPro her parents gave her for her 16th birthday, DeFeo made a commemorative video of her team’s state championship victory — and the rest was history. 
In high school, DeFeo continued making videos for her lacrosse team and other sports at her school while playing basketball and lacrosse. She is the all-time assist leader at Severna Park High School, a top ranked lacrosse program in Maryland.
Her first video in college, “A day in the life of USC Lacrosse,” went viral, garnering over 384,000 views on YouTube. DeFeo recognized that there was an eager group of viewers who wanted  to know what it’s like to be a student-athlete. 
“I remember searching YouTube late at night when I was in sixth or seventh grade trying to find videos like a day in the life of any college program, and I couldn’t,” DeFeo said. 
DeFeo didn’t originally intend to start a weekly vlog.
“It was going to be just one — a day in the life of our team,” DeFeo said. “The video took off, then we thought we should do a gameday video and a road trip experience. 
After teammate Amanda “Flay” Flayhan suffered a season-ending ACL injury in the 2018 season, DeFeo made videos to boost Flayhan’s mood.  
“After my injury, Katie turned the vlogs into a thing to make me laugh, get me off the couch and do something fun,” Flayhan said. 
These videos were the start of DeFeo’s growth as a social media personality. 
“We kind of used the vlog in a way to comfort her and have fun, and then we put it on the internet,” DeFeo said.
From there, DeFeo began releasing weekly videos focused on the team, her experience as a student-athlete and her life.
Just a month after she began posting videos about USC lacrosse, DeFeo started getting recognized in the street. Standing at 6-foot-3 and most often sporting some sort of Boston Celtics shirt, she’s hard to miss.
DeFeo’s teammates have also gained some fame. Working as a youth lacrosse coach over the summer, Flayhan noticed a change.
“I’d be shaking hands with the other team, seventh grade girls, and they would be star struck and say, ‘OMG! You’re Flay from the vlogs.’ It was crazy! I felt like I was a star,” Flayhan said.
DeFeo’s YouTube channel now has over 50,000 subscribers, nearly 150 videos and over 5 million total views, making her one of the most recognizable names in lacrosse.
DeFeo is comfortable discussing her role on the team as someone who doesn’t see consistent minutes.
“Not everybody can touch the field, and I know that,” DeFeo said. “Something that’s cool about our team is that everybody makes an impact. Our coach really emphasizes every single person in the locker room contributes whether we win or lose, and I truly, truly buy in and believe that.”
DeFeo’s teammates also acknowledge the dedication she puts into her channel day in and day out.
“Katie’s one of the hardest working and most dedicated people on this team,” junior attacker Izzy McMahon said. “The vlogs are her thing and even though she doesn’t see the field too much, it’s the attitude she brings to practice everyday and the amazing energy she gives us that I appreciate the most.” 
DeFeo also spends lots of her time talking and taking pictures with fans she meets. 
“Katie loves vlogging more than anything else,” Flayhan said. “She genuinely wants to give back and loves the kids.” 
Her channel is one of the most popular lacrosse related channels on YouTube rivaling her biggest personal influence, professional lacrosse star Paul Rabil. Rabil recently started his own Professional Lacrosse League and is one of the best players in the world. His videos have a total of 26 million views.
“Paul is a great inspiration in my life,” DeFeo said. “I admire the way he translated his success in athletics into becoming a media and marketing personality.”
Rabil inspired one of the quirkier aspects of DeFeo’s channel: She constantly reminds you to subscribe to the channel during her videos. DeFeo and guests on the videos scream, “Subscribe!” into the camera while a box with the subscriber count flashes on the screen and audio of a punch plays.
DeFeo’s popularity will no doubt help the growth of the already fastest growing sport in America.  Lacrosse’s  participation rate has grown over 226% since the inception of Division I lacrosse in 2001.
Flayhan and McMahon were the two teammates who gravitated toward the camera the most, but many other members of the lacrosse team have helped out with the videos. 
Kerrigan Miller, a former No. 1 high school recruit, filmed videos for a series called “KT vs.” where DeFeo swaps sports with other USC athletes. Even though Miller never appeared on camera, her humorous commentary from behind the camera added an unexpected enjoyable element to the videos that fans love. 
One of the guest athletes on “KT vs.,” USC volleyball player Victoria Garrick, launched her own YouTube channel, inspired by her appearance on DeFeo’s video. Now, Garrick’s following has grown to almost the same size as DeFeo’s. 
DeFeo’s social circle also includes USC basketball starting guard Jonah Mathews. Mathews has appeared in numerous vlogs and DeFeo constantly shouts him out on her social media accounts. 
“Katie’s so friendly and outgoing and people tend to gravitate toward someone who’s always positive and supportive,” Mathews said. “She has supported me from the day we met. She texts me after my games no matter the outcome telling me to keep going … To have someone like that in your corner is special and important.”
Mathews was surprised by the size of DeFeo’s fanbase after appearing in a few videos.
“When me and Katie filmed my first highlight video, I knew that she had a big following, but when we filmed our first vlog, I didn’t know it was that big,” Mathews said. “Being in one of her videos, I gained a lot of friends and fans.” 
Without knowing it, DeFeo became the standard for a college-athlete YouTuber. There is a large population of young athletes, who desire the inside scoop YouTubers can give them about what life is like playing a sport in college. 
Many young athletes desire the inside scoop that college athletes can share online. DeFeo’s videos detail her life as a student athlete, showing USC’s athlete laundry loop, private athletic dining hall and athlete-only study lounges.
Although most of DeFeo’s fan base consists of lacrosse players, her channel has a much further reach than just people interested in lacrosse.
Isabella Shadle, a high school student from Dallas, is a Katie DeFeo fan. 
“I found Katie’s videos while I was searching for sports documentaries because I wanted to make one for my soccer team. The first video I watched was her ‘Fhockumentary,’ and I watched it like 20 times,” Shadle said. “I continue to follow her because I don’t know as many people who are as funny and passionate as her, so it’s very entertaining.” 
While DeFeo’s fanbase spans across the U.S., many of them are on the East Coast, where lacrosse is more popular. Being in L.A. gives DeFeo the ability to reach a whole new fanbase and help lacrosse gain traction on the West Coast. 
Balancing school, lacrosse and YouTube — in no particular order —  presents its challenges. During the season, DeFeo has 20 hours of lacrosse a week, a full 16-credit course load and weekend away games.
“The videos become my side-hobby, with the amount of time I can dedicate to them, but at the same time I’m really trying to use my platform to get somewhere,” DeFeo said. 
Even though DeFeo began making videos for personal memories, once her videos started getting attention, her fans took over as the motivation for creating videos. 
“I like to call them viewers because I can’t believe I really have fans,” DeFeo said. 
But she does have fans, and she’s barely getting started. 
“I have no idea what my future holds, but I know it involves my fans, my YouTube channel, and lacrosse,” she said.

California has survived on a number of familiar stories. There is the story of James Marshall and the Gold Rush. There is the story of the doomed Donner Party from which Californians have extracted the lesson that it is distinctly possible for all people to betray their own blood. From parents, there are the cautionary tales of earthquakes and the Santa Anas, the warnings that when they come — and they will — the tree will collapse on the sedan, the mind will be shocked to flash point. 
“We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” 
This is the first sentence of Joan Didion’s seminal essay “The White Album,” which borrows its title from The Beatles’ experimental record. It remains one of the most iconic openings of any American essay. Just as striking, however, is what Didion adds in the following paragraph as a caveat: “Or at least we do for a while.”
What Didion is hinting at are the troubled terms of our existence. She writes, “We live entirely … by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the ‘ideas’ with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.” 
But what if we cannot draw cogent connections in our lives, and what if the “disparate images” we see do not lend themselves to any “narrative lines” we know? At what point do our stories — the ones we make to comfort ourselves — desert us?
“The White Album” — spanning nearly 40 pages and written over a 10-year period from 1968 to 1978 — undertakes the task of trying to make sense of 1960s America, a time in history devoid of any intelligible zeitgeist. It was a period when Didion herself reported, mostly from California, not a cohesive narrative but “flash pictures in variable sequence, images with no ‘meaning’ beyond their temporary arrangement, not a movie but a cutting room experience.”
Now, over 40 years since its publication, Didion’s essay has been reincarnated. Lars Jan, visual artist and director of Early Morning Opera, has adapted “The White Album” into a breathtaking theatrical piece. The West Coast portion of the tour opened at UCLA’s Ralph Freud Playhouse and ran from April 5 to 7. 
Like Didion’s essay, Jan’s production resists the enterprise of traditional storytelling. Jan presents the fractured stills captured in “The White Album” — Didion’s interviews with Linda Kasabian, her reportage of the Black Panther Party, her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and many beside — as a kaleidoscope of haunting images that appear “more electrical than ethical.” Jan stages fragmented vignettes that arrange themselves not into a puzzle, but into a handful of glass shards with no corresponding edges. 
In an era when “fake news” has become a fixture of our lives, where senselessness often offers itself as the only explanation for things, “The White Album” proves to be a timeless and timely piece. It is the very incomprehensibility of life on which both Didion’s essay and Jan’s performance are predicated.
To capture the “cutting room experience” Didion describes in her essay, Jan’s “White Album” relies on some unusual artistic choices. First, there are two audiences in the theater during the performance: an “outer” audience that spectates from traditional seating, and an “inner,” college-aged audience that sits onstage witnessing the mayhem unfold and partaking in it themselves. 
Dominating the stage is a large rectangular house; its all-white interior, frequently colored by flashes of neon light, can be seen through tall glass panels. Within this structure, the piece establishes many different settings. The audience, always engaged, is transported from the office of Didion’s psychiatrist to The Doors’ recording studio on Sunset Boulevard, from a party with Janis Joplin to a Students for a Democratic Society meeting at San Francisco State University.
Leading performer, Mia Barron, who is also Jan’s co-creator, achieves the impressive feat of reciting nearly the entirety of “The White Album” as one of the show’s sole narrators.
Clad in a white long-sleeve shirt and tan halter skirt — with a middle-part dividing her brown hair — Barron convincingly plays the role of Didion herself. She delivers Didion’s famous anecdotes with a cool, sinistral energy, and she eerily conjures a woman who, despite being named a Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year in 1968, was also characterized by a psychiatrist as having a “fundamentally pessimistic, fatalistic and depressive view of the world around her.”
Barron succeeds in depicting both a woman and an era experiencing bizarre and occasionally violent events. The murder trial of the Ferguson brothers, the nurse who watched as Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton bled to death, the stranger who showed up at Didion’s home on Franklin Avenue, empty-handed but still offering “Chicken Delight” — these comprised a montage of scenes which, to Didion, meant nothing and everything.
“I believe this to be an authentically senseless chain of correspondences,” Didion admits, “but in the jingle-jangle morning of that summer it made as much sense as anything else did.” 
Following the staged performance, both inner and outer audiences are merged into one. There is no longer distinction between cast and audience, director and usher, as all are open to partake in a discussion. 
“I lived through all of this,” one woman stood up and affirmed at the production I attended, “and nothing really made sense then. It doesn’t really make sense now.”
Many often misread Didion’s essay as one of sheer cynicism. Jan’s production reminds us that “The White Album” is not a project of senselessness, but a project about senselessness. Yes, Didion elucidates the horror of disorder, of being unable to find “the sermon in the suicide, the social or moral lesson in the murder of five,” but she provides hope that a life can still be manageable and fulfilling amid such chaos.
In his director’s note, Jan contends that by “laying bare the near breakdown of her coping mechanism,” Didion has distilled the nonsense of her life into “one of the most illuminating stories of all.” He has reproduced this frightening affect with his stunning stage adaptation.
Midway through the performance, Barron emerges from the dark; she is suddenly atop the glass house. Fog clouds her facial features, and she stands stiffly, arms by her side, as a hazy light emanates from behind her. Staring blankly forward, she seems confused, frightened even, and she is paralyzed by the accounts she has just detailed. She has lived through these accounts onstage.
“There were rumors. There were stories. Everything was unmentionable,” she rattles off, holding a pause and then continuing. “But nothing was unimaginable.” 
“Everything was unmentionable,” Barron says. “But nothing was unimaginable.”
Therein lies the difference, and therein lies the hope.

Some time ago, I embarked on a well-intentioned — albeit short lived — self-improvement kick that led me to attempt a keto diet, start journaling nightly and download a helpful but insulting app that monitored and restricted my daily social media usage. But since I am equal parts insatiable art lover and shameless Instagram addict, I quickly fell (no, leaped) off the wagon with that last one. With Instagram’s eye-catching aesthetics and creative content niches, I simply couldn’t stay away. And evidently, neither can its upward of 1 billion monthly active users. 
It was perhaps inevitable, then, that Instagram would shake up visual culture by introducing a language of images that inflates our notions of reality in unprecedented ways. Every post, every pictorial representation, is a miniature piece of the world — of someone’s life — that anyone can manufacture, acquire and disseminate.  
“The most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise,” Susan Sontag writes in her seminal essay collection “On Photography,” “is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads — as an anthology of images.” 
With Instagram, the anthology of the world through images is not only in our heads — it’s literally in our hands and invariably on our minds. In turn, the visual code Instagram creates affects the way we act and conduct ourselves in cultural contexts. It effectively rewires our minds to make us believe that we must participate in Instagram’s artificial image mass, that we must buy into the multimodal myth of its methods. 
I recently started thinking critically about how completely Instagram has brainwashed me and others into believing photo-ops and subsequent likes are what make visual experiences worth living. I stalked my own feed and considered each individual image I’d posted — had I done it for the memories or for the digital attention it wrought? I came up with an ambiguous answer that led me to further question my own social media practices and intentions. 
There are countless times I’ve directed good-natured friends to capture different angles until I’m satisfied and sufficiently assured I got the shot that will reap the most Instagram likes. As much as I hate to admit it, the prospect of Instagram-fueled validation looms in the back of my mind like a raincloud — during nights out with friends, while exploring Los Angeles, when traveling abroad. I know I’m not alone, either. 
We’ve all been conditioned by the ubiquity of Instagram’s game of numbers and system of superficial substantiation to believe that contemporary visual culture has a right to co-opt our human experiences as commodities. More than that, we are all eager and complacent participants because Instagram’s visual cache accommodates the instant gratification and addictive euphoria it knows we seek. 
Recently, anti-Instagram movements have popped up all over the globe as counters to the phenomenon of photo-tourism. It’s not hard to see why photography and tourism go hand in hand so neatly but Sontag explains it best: “Photographs will offer indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had.” 
Naturally, complaints about travelers — drawn to remote or extraordinary locations usually for the sole purpose of documenting and flaunting their experiences — blatantly disrespecting local environments in their attempts to secure the perfect shot abound. 
As people flocked to capture views that would allow them to reasonably employ Ralph Waldo Emerson quotes as captions, traffic on secluded trails eroded environments and taxed national park resources. Tourism boards have launched anti-Instagram campaigns to discourage photography and geotagging, and even Instagram accounts (like the satirical @joshuatreehatesyou,) routinely condemn other users for impudent posts. 
It’s this visceral hunger for visual mastery and manufactured self-representation — borne of human nature but bred by Instagram culture — that draws people in droves to take photos in front of the Mona Lisa or gallivant through the Louvre courtyard without stopping to consider the hallowed history of the institution and the masterpieces it holds. 
It’s what compels Instagrammers to trample fields of ultra-rare poppies in pursuit of the perfect, bohemian shot and treat living things as no more than photoshoot backdrops. It’s what spurs the South African government to prohibit photographers from geotagging safari routes following a surge in rhino poaching. It’s what induces Auschwitz Memorial visitors to stage abhorrent photo shoots on the very railways that hauled over 1 million people to their deaths. 
At the same time, taking and sharing photographs as moments has become indispensable to the way we experience the world. I’m not saying Instagram and its nefarious agenda should be eradicated; on the contrary, the possibilities the platform presents for image-sharing and global connection are monumental. 
I just think that we all (myself included) should vow to be more aware of how our vanity-driven actions impact natural landscapes or historical sites and adjust our shallow intentions when it comes to photo-taking and memory-making. Change starts with being cognizant of the social media culture we have inadvertently been absorbed into and taking steps to resist letting comments and clicks dictate our self-value. 
How many likes is a patch of dead wildflowers or the desecrated site of Holocaust victims worth? Try this Instagram aesthetic for a change: Don’t be a dick to nature or history. I promise life is still worth living when you aren’t doing it for the likes and when photography is made a perfunctory affair. Just ask Susan Sontag.

The Thornton School of Music Concert Jazz Orchestra went retro at its Jazz Night on Monday. Its pieces transported the audience to grassy plains, underground caverns, ghostly manors and roads of rainbows, with one mustachioed plumber tying them all together.
Led by director Jason Goldman, an assistant professor of jazz studies at Thornton, the group sought to bring audiences into its concerts through a unique choice of theme. 
“Me, being the geek that I am, thought, ‘Man, it’d be cool to do a concert of video games!’” Goldman said. “This year, I thought we would have a focus on games with Mario in them since there are so many games to choose from. Plus, everyone knows Mario.”
The concert began with the bombastic opening theme from “Super Smash Bros. Melee,” complete with rapid drum riffs and fanfare blasts working in tandem to capture the spirit of the breakneck brawler game.
The ensemble continued with covers of tracks from other “Mario” titles. The tropical “Delfino Plaza” from “Super Mario Sunshine” was led by a soft piano carrying the main melody, while the cheery yet eerie “Ghost House” theme from “Super Mario World” filled the theater with low reverberations, the once gentle piano now playing a spine-tingling tune.
Freshman Peter No, who is majoring in film and television production,  was keen to the CJO’s cover of “Rainbow Road” from “Super Mario Kart.” The arrangement, which fittingly opened with a stoplight countdown and the whirs of go-kart engines, utilized a prominent flute and an overwhelming crescendo from the wind section to rework the tension of the precarious racer into a calmer groove.
“I could feel my heart pound as I listened to the familiar yet unfamiliar melodies in my head,” No said. “I really loved how the orchestra brought elements of the original game into their performance. From the beginning countdown to the satisfying completion of the finish line, I felt like the game had come to life.”
Drummer Suraj Partha, a senior majoring in jazz studies, noted how nostalgia was a key factor in bringing the “Mario” songs to the stage. 
“I was really excited when I heard we were going to play songs from the ‘Mario’ series,” Partha said. “It’s amazing how lasting and relevant that music is, just how many themes we could recognize and play in a modern jazz context. The music is timeless, really.”
The grand finale comprised the famous “Underground Theme,” combining songs from “Super Mario Bros.” and “Super Mario Bros. 2” to create an ominous tune filled with moving saxophones and intertwining harmonies. 
“It gave me so much nostalgia,” said Blair Evans, a freshman majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and cultures. “I was listening to this song all over again, but with its own sort of individuality that made it seem like new.”
To Goldman, one of the perks of working with “Mario” songs and other popular video game themes comes from reimagination. 
“We don’t want to play it exactly as it appears in the game a lot of the time, plus the orchestration in a game is often much different from a jazz band,” he said. “One of the goals of arrangers is to take a song’s main theme and develop their own ideas and concepts around that theme. It’s really part of the fun.”
Partha similarly noted that freedom with established themes made the arrangements stand out.
“The student arrangers are very talented in that they can take the essence of the song and mess around with it,” Partha said. “They can play with different styles — say, play some sections in mambo or rock-funk — and that’s why it’s a testament to how good the original game songs are. They can still work in all these different settings; different composers and arrangers can still take those themes and put a new take on them.”
