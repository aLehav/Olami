Flora Laney Thornton, a renowned philanthropist and music enthusiast who gave her name to the Thornton School of Music, died May 7 of pulmonary disease. She was 96.
High notes · Many said Thornton, who performed in two Broadway musicals in the 1930s, had an infectious love of music and saw her own passion mimicked by USC students who benefited from her donations. -  Photo courtesy of Steve Cohn, USC 
Thornton was known for her lifelong passion for the arts and played a vibrant role in the Los Angeles cultural community.
“She was a culture-classy, artistic woman that you would expect to find in old Hollywood movies,” said Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta. “She was one of the most fascinating people I’ve ever met.”
Friends described Thornton as passionate, timeless and elegant.
“She was dignified and classic with a great sense of humor,” said former Thornton Dean Larry Livingston.
“She was really one of the classiest ladies,” said Thornton Director of Development Abel Delgado. “She was extremely beautiful and well-dressed at all times.”
In 1999, Thornton donated $25 million to the USC endowment that benefits student scholarships and facility funds. Thornton’s modesty almost hindered the naming of the music school, but after some convincing from the university, Thornton accepted the honor of having her name represent the school, Cutietta said.
Thornton’s generosity and love for the school was unique, Livingston said.
“She was one of those donors from heaven,” he said. “She was very empathetic to the mission of our school.”
As an honorary member of the Board of Trustees and a member of the Keck School’s Board of Overseers, Thornton attended regular meetings at the university. Although Thornton’s health weakened in recent years, Cutietta said, she remained a visible figure in university life.
“What was amazing is that even in her 90s, she was present at everything,”  Delgado said. “She wasn’t just a person who was involved in giving, she came to everything — and I mean everything.”
In addition to regular meetings at the university, supporting the Los Angeles Opera, funding cancer research and contributing to a number of charities, Thornton often attended student performances on campus.
“She loved watching the students,” Cutietta said. “She gave money to help young people.”
“She saw in our students a young version of her when she first moved to New York and tried to make it in her career,” Livingston said of Thornton, who performed in two Broadway musicals in the 1930s in New York City.
In February 2006, Thornton donated another $5 million to the music school for new facilities the school desperately needed, Cutietta said. The music school plans to name its new garden in honor of Thornton.
“She was a lover of the arts. She was really passionate about education. She was really passionate about the students,” Delgado said.
In fall 2009, Thornton donated the lead gift to help commemorate the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the music school.
“I really believe that the reason behind [her involvement] was her love for the school. It was her school and she just loved coming,” Delgado said.
Thornton is survived by her second husband, Eric Small, sons Charles and Laney, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

More than 10,000 graduates were honored Friday as the university celebrated its 127th annual commencement ceremony with an address from outgoing president Steven B. Sample, who encouraged graduates to strive for a more fulfilling life by achieving more than professional success.
One last speech · In his final commencement address to the graduating class of 2010, President Steven B. Sample stresses the importance of character and encourages graduates to evaluate their relationships with money, children and God.  - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan 
“In the final analysis, what determines a person’s ultimate success is not so much his professional abilities or political brilliance as it is his character,” Sample said.
Sample advised graduates to ask themselves three questions as they looked toward their future: how they felt about money, how they felt about children and how they felt about God.
“If you should be so fortunate as to find answers for yourself to these three questions, you will almost certainly gain a better understanding of the meaning of life, of your place in the universe and of how you might live in productive peace and harmony with your fellow human beings,” Sample said. “And that, after all, is what living well is all about.”
Although some students initially expressed disappointment that Sample — who, after serving as the university’s president since 1991, will step down from the post in August — was selected as USC’s commencement speaker, many who graduated Friday said his speech was inspiring and a good cap to the ceremonies.
“I think he did a wonderful job,” said Erin Greene, who majored in international relations. “He encouraged us to consider important questions we all need to ask ourselves.”
Not all students were satisfied, however. Jeremy Allen, who majored in fine arts, said the speech didn’t measure up to Sample’s accomplishments.
“I really like Sample, but I thought the speech was underwhelming,” Allen said. “I expected something a little more inspirational.”
Also recognized for their accomplishments Friday were five honorary degree recipients, including former Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton, noted scientist Ting-Kai Li, conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen and past president of Botswana Festus G. Mogae.
Three students were also recognized for their work in the university’s main commencement ceremony: valedictorian Liana Ching, who majored in chemical engineering, and salutatorians Natasha Naik, who majored in biomedical engineering, and Lisa Werth, who majored in biological sciences.
Overall, students said the ceremony was a fitting end to their college careers, and that Sample’s speech was an appropriate send-off.
“He was able to summarize how he was able to run the university,” Greene said. “[Sample] gave us a model of how to lead.”

The USC track and field team had a solid showing at the conference championships, winning six titles on the last day of competition.
The men entered Sunday’s events in fourth place and had 40 points, while the women sat in seventh and had 17 points.
“I thought our men did just about everything they could possibly do in terms of maximizing our potential,” said Ron Allice, director of the USC track and field team.
The men finished with 156 points, 64 points ahead of the third-place Stanford Cardinal. That was the most points any team had ever earned at the conference championships without winning first place, according to Allice.
Many Trojans won individual titles throughout the weekend. Senior Ahmad Rashad earned himself two after finishing first in both the 100- and 200-meter dashes. This was the third time he won the two races, after winning both during his freshman and junior seasons.
“The reason he didn’t do it his sophomore year was he was injured,” Allice said of Rashad. “Outside of that, he has dominated his conference throughout his entire career.”
Rashad became the first Pac-10 male athlete to win both of these races three times. In fact, nobody had won either race three times, let alone both.
Senior Manjula Wijesekara, senior Aven Wright and sophomore Joey Hughes also won individual titles in the high jump, triple jump and 400-meter dash, respectively. With a time of 45.16, Hughes now holds the seventh-best time in USC history. This win capped off what was a very busy weekend for him.
“To run two [4×100] relays, a [4×400] relay, two 200-[meter dashes] and two 400-[meter dashes] in two days is a Herculean effort,” said Allice.
Some of the highlights for the women included when freshman Lauren Chambers took second place in the hammer competition and redshirt sophomore Lauren Guerrieri finished second in the women’s discus.
One unfortunate moment for the women occurred during the 4×400 relay. The team consisted of seniors Elizabeth Olear, Myra Hasson and Shalina Clark, as well as sophomore Dalilah Muhammad.
The team finished third in the relay but was later disqualified because Hasson was not present for her race on Saturday. While this was because of a clerical error, the disqualification nonetheless cost the women six points. They finished the weekend only half a point behind the third place Arizona Sun Devils.
While the infraction kept her from medaling in the relay final, Muhammad did earn second place in the women’s 400-meter intermediate hurdles for the second straight year, earning eight points for her team.
Now that the conference championships are over, the Trojans can look ahead to NCAA regionals at the end of the month, followed by the NCAA championships in June. But Allice stresses that success last weekend does not guarantee victories in upcoming tournaments.
“You can be the best in America and not get through it,” Allice said. “You gotta line up and be ready on that day, and if you’re not ready on that day, you won’t be moving on.”

With final exams in the classroom finished for the semester, the No. 10 USC men’s golf team is gearing up for its biggest tests of the season on the golf course.
The Trojans have only two tournaments remaining on the schedule: this week’s NCAA regional championships at the Gold Mountain Golf Club in Bremerton, Wash., and, if they qualify, the NCAA championships in early June.
“The great thing now is that we don’t have to worry about going to class or exams or writing a paper,” junior Matt Giles said. “Our sole focus is our games and getting ready for the tournament. It’s an advantage we have over other schools that haven’t finished yet.”
In order to move on to the NCAA championships, the Trojans will need to finish in the top five of their 13-team regional.
“I like where we ended up,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “We played the course earlier this year and it’s a good, difficult golf course. I think we have a team that plays well on tough courses.”
All five of the Trojans starters this week played at the Gold Mountain course in September at the Fall Preview, where USC finished in seventh place.
The Trojans are seeded second in the regional, behind host and Pac-10 champion No. 4 Washington. Big Ten champion No. 11 Illinois, No. 25 Oregon State and San Diego are among the other favorites in the packed region.
The Trojans top performer of the season, freshman T.J. Vogel, will lead USC’s contingent in Washington. Vogel, who has finished no lower than a tie for 22nd in his last five tournaments, was named the Pac-10 Co-freshman of the Year last week.
Vogel finished in a tie for 27th at 9 over par at the Fall Preview in September.
Giles, a junior and two-time All-American, was USC’s highest finisher at the Pac-10 championships, placing in a tie for 10th. His score of 12 over par at the Fall Preview earned him a tie for 36th.
“My game is looking pretty good,” Giles said. “I’ve had a few days to tidy some things up and I’m looking forward to getting into it.”
Sophomore Steve Lim, a second team All-Pac-10 performer, finished in a tie for 26th at last month’s Pac-10 championships and tied for 32nd at 11 over par at the Fall Preview.
Lim’s performance at the NCAA West Regional last season, where he shot a final round 66 to help the Trojans squeak into the NCAA championships by one shot, showed this year’s freshmen what a rookie can accomplish in the postseason.
Freshman Martin Trainer has been a solid contributor for the Trojans all season and his best finish came on the Gold Mountain course, where he shot 6 over par to place in a tie for 12th at the Fall Preview.
“The course sets up really well for me and our team because we strike it well,” Trainer said. “It’s tough to get the ball on the green and it’s tough to get up and down. It’s a great track.”
Freshman Sam Smith claimed the fifth and final spot in the USC lineup with a strong showing at the Pac-10 championships. Playing for the first time since early March, Smith finished in a tie for 20th, the third-best finish by a Trojan.
Smith tied for 43rd at 14 over par at the Fall Preview.
With three freshmen and no seniors, USC is one of the younger teams in the field.
Trainer said he and the other freshmen have looked to Giles, the Trojans’ most experienced postseason player, to be a certifiable leader.
“Matt has a lot of good advice,” Trainer said. “He’s done this twice now and he has a lot of good pointers.”
Zambri said his players make up for their lack of experience with a unique calmness under pressure.
“I think it’s less about their age and more about who they are,” Zambri said. “I just think they’re a real professional young group and I’ll take that any day.”
The tournament begins Thursday and concludes with the final round Saturday.

After winning the NCAA Central Region  championship on May 8, the women’s golf team will test its momentum at this week’s NCAA championships in North Carolina, with play beginning Tuesday and going through Friday.
This is the 13th straight year the No. 3 team has advanced to the national championship under coach Andrea Gaston, though she treats every year as a new challenge.
“I don’t take the 13 years for granted because, especially now,  I see a lot more competitiveness across the country,” Gaston said.
Led by three All-Americans, senior Belen Mozo, junior Lizette Salas and sophomore Jennifer Song, the team will vie for its third national title and its second in three years.
Song, who is ranked second in the nation overall, looks to be a key player for the Women of Troy after winning two tournaments and placing in the top three in three other tournaments during the 2009-2010 season. She also spent time on the LPGA circuit while in college, where she competed in the Kraft Nabisco National Championship and placed 21st overall.
“She does have the ability to rise and she’s shown that by playing in the Nabisco championship,” Gaston said. “She always has a goal of what she’s trying to accomplish.”
The No. 10 Salas placed in the top six four times in her last six events of the season, including second place at the Central Region championship, where she finished two strokes behind the leader.
Though hampered by injuries during the season, Mozo ranks 34th in the nation and third for the Women of Troy. She also earned 2010 All-Pac-10 honorable mention honors.
Joining Mozo in the All-Pac-10 honorable mention category was freshman Cyna Rodriguez. The newcomer, from the Philippines, finished 10th at the Pac-10 championship and 16th at Central Region. Gaston welcomed Rodriguez and said she has kept the team’s spirits high throughout the season.
“She really enjoys the team aspect of golf,” Gaston said.  “Keeping her loose and having her have fun is good.”
With classes out of session for the year, the team is usually much more focused and ready to compete after the spring semester ends.
“We’re through all the finals and we can come here and focus on golf,” Gaston said.
The Women of Troy will play with No. 26 South Carolina and No. 4 Arizona in the first two rounds of the tournament.
Across town, the top-seeded UCLA Bruins go into the tournament as another legitimate contender. Golf publications across the nation unanimously rank the Bruins as the No. 1 team in the country.
Despite the higher stakes and a shot at bragging rights, Gaston said the team should walk away satisfied no matter the eventual outcome.
“This is a culmination of a great year,” Gaston said.  “We want to enjoy the championship and making it this far.”

As I’ve walked around the USC campus the past few days, I have seen nothing but tears, last minute photo ops and heartfelt goodbyes.
I get that graduation represents some sense of finality — the light at the end of the tunnel for college students. But for those who fear that an exit from the university’s pearly gates will be more than just a temporary goodbye, rest assured there is one potential departure from these friendly confines that will hardly warrant the type of emotions typically the norm this time of year.
When students take their final strides on the worn path of this memory-filled institution, odds are they stop by Tommy Trojan, the Leavey Library fountain, the Finger Fountain or the hollowed grounds of the Los Angeles Coliseum. Yet, I for one can no longer imagine many students making the fateful walk out toward the direction of a once-notorious campus mainstay, Dedeaux Field.
While a visit to the home of the USC baseball team is a history lesson regardless of the time of year, the sights and sounds of the storied program these days (yes, even more storied than the beloved football program), appear to be a few shades darker than when Chad Kreuter first stepped onto the scene.
In summer 2006, Athletic Director Mike Garrett handed over a university treasure to Kreuter, a former big league catcher for 16 years, in the hopes that a man who had spent his life’s work on a baseball diamond could over time mature into a figure that would uphold the national pastime as a staple in USC’s ever-evolving athletic tradition.
Though it’s easy to play the cynic in this story of deterioration, watching the transformation of a national powerhouse-turned-Pac-10-conference-afterthought is hard to bear, even for someone who wasn’t present to witness the golden years of Mike Gillespie, USC’s tried-and-true coach before Kreuter.
In some respects it’s hard to blame Kreuter, seeing as he’s not only the son-in-law of Gillespie but also the man chosen to fill his irreplaceable shoes in the dugout. Even the most skeptical of people, if logical, understand you don’t just replace a man whose 20-year career in Cardinal and Gold was paved with four College World Series appearances, a .618 winning percentage and a National Championship in 1998.
Yet when you take over the post of a prestigious athletic program where consistency and on-field excellence are not just gold standards but a way of life, ultimately winning is what defines you as a coach. For Kreuter, it has been a four-year stint defined by the bottom line — one that reads doughnut holes across the board where conference titles and regional banners once stood.
While the former Dodgers catcher had familiarity both with managing a team and the USC program itself before he became the fourth manager in school history, it didn’t take long to realize he was in over his head.
In his first year, USC finished with an underwhelming 27-29 record, a meager eight wins in the Pac-10 and an unprecedented losing record at home (12-16). It would be the first time since 1923 that the program posted back-to-back losing seasons.
Although the first years in college as a student or a coach can be rough, Kreuter’s early slump was a telling sign that this was likely not a match made in heaven. In his second season, led by crafty left-hander Tommy Milone and shortstop Grant Green, USC produced a 28-28 record, a tie for 6th in the Pac-10 and a campaign that ended well short of a regional appearance.
Last season, despite a cavalcade of potential pro prospects — Green, right-hander Brad Boxberger and catcher/pitcher Robert Stock — and a home schedule more befitting of a school that plays for a second tier conference, another .500 and a losing record in the Pac-10 should have raised a red flag in Garrett’s office that a shakeup needed to be made.
But the 2010 season, one which on paper seemed like an absolute  must-win year for the team, doesn’t need any summaries to capture its essence. The stench (23-28, 5-16, after this weekend’s sweep at the hands of crosstown rival UCLA) is obvious, the unfulfilled expectations apparent, and the likely end of a disappointing era looms nearer and nearer with each passing day.
I don’t like to be the bearer of bad news, but let’s face it: The writing has been on the wall for some time now — at least on the one I’m staring at.  
This is not a criticism of Chad Kreuter, the man, the father or the former player. I do not consider myself of the ilk to stand before anyone and act as if I can comprehend the pressures of coaching at this university.
I believe at his core, the USC skipper takes pride in his team’s performance, the way the members represent the university inside the white lines and how much preparation it takes to maintain a program like the one he took over in 2006.
However, I was once told that history only remembers the brilliant failures and brilliant successes of an individual’s life, and despite what looked to be a recipe for success when the initial hire was made (former catcher-turned-manager a la Joe Torre and Mike Scioscia), if Kreuter, the coach, were to have graduated this past weekend, I can guarantee it wouldn’t haven’t been with high regards.
While it is safe to say this program is surrounded by an experienced coaching staff, a well-regarded media relations team and several highly touted ballplayers  — sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa, sophomore outfielder/pitcher Alex Sherrod and redshirt sophomore right-hander Andrew Triggs just to name a few) the role of a coach is not only to recruit and nurture this talent on an individual level but to harness the strengths of the whole when the lights turn on from February through June. And in this area, quite simply he has missed the mark.
Goodbyes can be painful, emotional and in some cases life-altering, but when I look at the impending future of Kreuter and USC baseball, parting ways seems mutually beneficial anyway you slice it. This program is bigger than any one player, coach or athletic director, and to dismiss the consistent pattern of on-field futility over the past few years is to disgrace the legacies of those who have come before.
Sometimes saying goodbye is hard, but I’d like to believe making the right decision trumps the emotion behind an unavoidable departure.

When USC coach Chad Kreuter jogged to the pitcher’s mound with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning Sunday afternoon, he wanted reliever Chad Smith to relax. He also wanted to assure the sophomore he could get UCLA left fielder Cody Keefer out by pitching him low and outside.
Up and down · Freshman designated hitter Cade Kreuter hit a solo homer in Sunday’s 2-1 loss to UCLA but also struck out twice on the day. -  Courtesy USC Sports Information 
Apparently, Smith did not listen.
Two pitches after the meeting, Smith shook off sophomore catcher Kevin Roundtree and went against the coaching staff’s pitch selection, choosing to throw an inside fastball. Keefer turned on the pitch and lined it over the right field wall for a walk-off, two-run home run that gave the Bruins (37-11, 13-8) a 2-1 victory and series sweep of USC (23-28, 5-16) at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
“We’re baffled as a coaching staff,” Kreuter said. “That was a pitch he should have never thrown. That’s a cardinal sin. You don’t throw [inside] with the winning run at the plate with two out in the ninth inning.”
Kreuter placed blame on both Smith and Roundtree for not following the instructions he imparted during the mound visit.
“They have to trust that we’ve got a good scouting report,” Kreuter said. “We chart all the pitches and see what we’ve got guys out on. That should not have happened. It just shouldn’t have happened.”
Up until the final pitch of the game, the only scoring occurred in the fourth inning when freshman Cade Kreuter launched a 1-0 fastball from Rob Rasmussen over the left-centerfield fence for a home run.
Rasmussen allowed only six hits while striking out eight batters in seven innings, but senior starting pitcher Kevin Couture’s second consecutive strong performance had USC on the verge of salvaging one win against its rivals before Keefer’s homer.
“Couture went through a rut [earlier in the season] where everyone was hitting everything off him, but today he pitched to the corners and kept the ball down probably the best he has all year,” coach Kreuter said. “I’m extremely proud of him.”
Couture threw five scoreless innings while allowing only two hits Sunday, following a six inning outing against Long Beach State. He gave up only two runs on six hits in the Wednesday night start against the Dirtbags.
But Couture didn’t get a win in either game as limited run support and bullpen woes haunted the Trojans.
Against Long Beach, USC managed only four hits and one run – a line drive home run by senior outfielder Mike O’Neill.
In the series against their crosstown rival, USC was outscored 30-10 with seven of those runs coming Friday night. Despite roughing up Bruins’ ace Gerrit Cole for five runs in five innings Friday night, the Trojans fell 13-7. Sophomore slugger Ricky Oropesa knocked four hits in the series opener and drove in four runs, including two on a towering home run that bounced off the Gifford Hitting Facility beyond the right field wall.
But USC couldn’t overcome a short outing by sophomore starter Ben Mount (three innings pitched, three earned runs) and six runs allowed by the bullpen.
It was more of the same Saturday. Junior starter Chris Mezger was knocked around for 10 hits and eight runs – six earned – in only four and  one-third innings pitched; the bullpen allowed an additional seven runs; and the offense was unable to string together hits, leaving 15 men on base and scoring only two runs.
All of which made Sunday’s heartbreaking loss even more devastating.
“That hurts because it’s stolen away from you with two outs in the ninth,” coach Kreuter said. “There’s more disappointment because we had the game won.”
Prior to the current four-game losing streak, USC had won six of seven, including two of three from Arizona, who was nationally ranked No. 19 at the time. Kreuter hoped his team would carry the momentum of a three-game sweep of Utah into the games against Long Beach and UCLA.
The Trojans are now buried at the bottom of the Pac-10 conference standings. Sitting three and one-half games behind the next closest team with only six conference games remaining, USC will need help to avoid finishing last in the conference for the second time in Kreuter’s four-year tenure — and only the third time in the last 80 years.

Instead of partaking in Friday’s commencement ceremonies and celebrating the end of their scholastic careers, USC seniors Tumua Anae, Kami Craig, Forel Davies, Alexandra Kiss and Kally Lucas had their own kind of celebration over the weekend.
Celebration · USC’s women’s water polo squad took home the 2010 NCAA title after beating Stanford 10-9 on Sunday. After the clock ran out on the victory, coach Jovan Vavic jumped into the pool with his players to celebrate the victory. -  Courtesy USC Sports Information 
Looking to overcome previous postseason failures, USC’s veteran core found itself in San Diego, participating in the NCAA water polo championships with the hope of possibly earning that ever-elusive national title. But unlike in past seasons, the No. 2 seeded USC women’s water polo team (25-3) got over the hump at last — defeating No. 1 seeded Stanford by a score of 10-9 to become NCAA champions.
“I can’t believe I’m even holding this trophy in my hands,” said Craig, a senior two-meter, who was named tournament MVP. “A lot of effort went into it this. It was about time.”
This season’s surreal finish comes after postseason glory had eluded the Women of Troy in years past. During the two seasons prior to 2010, USC had been eliminated by crosstown rival UCLA in the national championship game, but this time around it was USC that came out on top.
“It was honestly one of the best feelings in the world and the best part about it is I am doing it with my best friends,” said Lucas, a fellow senior. “This is my last water polo game ever and to go out with a win is so exciting for me.”
But as Craig previously noted, edging Stanford, a team that had already defeated the Women of Troy twice this season, and taking home the title would take a tremendous effort. But it was a collective effort, as USC saw seven different players get the ball past Stanford goalie Amber Oland.
Lucas, junior two-meter Kristen Dronberger and  freshman two-meter Patricia Jancso each added two goals apiece, as Kiss, Craig and fellow teammates Joelle Bekhazi, a junior driver, and Dominique Sardo, a freshman driver, each contributed one goal.
“This was a 100 percent team effort,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “We had so many players play well. Our seniors played a great game. They played with lots of fire, lots of heart. I am so happy to see them end their careers with a win.”
Before being able to celebrate, however, the Women of Troy were forced to focus on stopping the Cardinal’s second half surge. Holding a 6-3 halftime lead, Vavic’s bunch slowly watched Stanford open the third quarter on fire, as driver Kim Kreuger got a lob shot past Anae just 48 seconds in, lowering the deficit to two. A minute later, Stanford would then cut the USC lead to just one following a goal from driver Kelly Eaton.
With their lead suddenly in flux, the Women of Troy would elevate their play on both ends of the pool. The defense, forced to stop a potent Stanford offense threatening to thwart the team’s title hopes, shut down the Cardinal when it mattered most, creating a pile of Stanford turnovers. On the offensive end, USC took advantage of those miscues, scoring four consecutive goals to build a nearly insurmountable 10-6 lead midway through the 4th quarter.
“We needed to stay and play a smart game,” Anae said. “We still had a few minutes left so our focus was on defense and patience on offense. You don’t want to back down, but you don’t want to start playing bad water polo.”
USC was tested in a similar manner the day before during its semifinal matchup against Loyola Marymount. Holding a narrow 7-6 lead during the early stages of the final period, the Women of Troy, having already defeated Marist 20-5 in the opening round, reeled off three consecutive goals to punch their ticket to the championship game.
“I’ve got to say that LMU improved from the beginning of the season to the NCAAs,” Vavic noted. “If they were not tired, tonight could have been a different game.”
Nonetheless, USC got the job done, capturing its third women’s water polo championship in school history and eighth championship overall for Vavic, who also led the men’s team to the title in the fall.
“I swear, I was as excited for this finish and for this championship as I was for the first one,” Vavic added. “[Winning] just doesn’t get old. In some ways, I was even more excited for this, because we waited for so long.”

System falters
I am extremely disappointed in the university’s failure to communicate with students, faculty and staff on Tuesday, April 27, while the school was on lockdown following a bomb threat to Leavey Library.
The lives of all members of the Trojan Family are endangered when critical emergency information is not disseminated in a timely fashion. As of 3 p.m., I had not received a single notification regarding the incident. Furthermore, there was nothing listed on the USC website home page or on the Emergency Information Page regarding the incident. When I visited the website on April 27, it stated that the site was last updated on March 15, 2010.
This lack of information not only caused my colleagues and I to be mildly inconvenienced but created chaos as people attempted to leave campus in their vehicles, unaware that the gates surrounding campus would be locked.
The lack of information caused students and visitors alike to swarm the area hoping to gather information, likely making the job of the safety officials more difficult as they had to deal with the crowds rather than investigate the threat.
A simple e-mail sent to the entire USC community acknowledging the lockdown would have alleviated the fear, chaos and inconvenience experienced by all. I know this is something USC has the means to do, as, just that day, I received an e-mail sent to all students regarding purchasing fall football tickets.
To be fair, I have heard in several news reports that a Trojans Alert was sent out regarding the situation. However, as a graduate student I have never had the opportunity to sign up for such a service. Trojans Alert and similar services only serve their purpose when all community members are made aware of their existence.
While helicopters hovering overhead were likely broadcasting information across Los Angeles, those of us on campus were not informed about what was taking place just a few feet away. In the future, I hope that a school-wide e-mail, website updates and a comprehensive emergency notification system are all used to alert us when there is an emergency taking place.
Thankfully, the incident was merely a scare. I hate to think what the result would have been if, God forbid, there were an actual bomb on or near campus and students, faculty, and staff were not given the information necessary to keep themselves safe and allow law enforcement officials to do their job in the most effective manner possible.

In “The Farting Rapist,” Alexandra Lydon’s eight-page nonfiction account of a night in Ireland gone horribly awry, the author alternately refers to the titular antagonist as “[her] very own Daniel Day-Lewis lookalike,” “a flatulent Trekkie” and “an assumed member of the IRA.” What she doesn’t do, however, is play the victim, despite her potentially traumatic near-rape experience while vacationing with her friend Laura Kindred.

“[It] was actually a dark moment,” Lydon said. “But when my mind now goes to that night or that man, what I see is a theatre full of people laughing and an almost cartoon-like recreation of the event.”
Forging smiles from tears and manufacturing laughter from misery, embarrassment and despair requires a complex narrative alchemy that is easy for no one and evades many would-be writers altogether, but with Worst Laid Plans: When Bad Sex Happens to Good People, Lydon asked her contributors to do just that by submitting brief anecdotes of the most intimate nature — personal stories of their sexual misadventures.
The collection of bad sex horror stories published earlier this month by Abrams Image represents only the most recent incarnation of an idea conceived by Lydon and Kindred in the aftermath of the events described “The Farting Rapist.”
“In an attempt to lighten the mood and shift our focus, we found ourselves telling each other stories of previous bad sexual experiences we both had and making each other laugh,” Lydon said. “It was simple but oddly effective.”
In a flash of drunken inspiration the following night as Lydon and Kindred were walking home from a pub, they had the idea of repurposing their morning-after stories as material for a staged show. Because of the pair’s ties to the comedy community, including college friends and future contributors Erin Pineda, Casey Wilson, June Raphael, Tymberlee Hill and Matt McConkey, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre eventually came to house the show, which had been running for almost two years before Lydon and Kindred were contacted about adapting the show into a book.
The bulk of the material in Worst Laid Plans: When Bad Sex Happens to Good People came from an open call for submissions specifically intended for the book. Lydon estimated that only 30 percent of the book’s material came from workshopped monologues taken from the Upright Citizens Brigade show Worst Laid Plans: True Stories of Terrible Sex, which is still running in New York and Los Angeles and has featured the likes of actress Janeane Garofalo and Saturday Night Live alumna Amy Poehler.
Predictably, some of the contributors’ sexcapades transitioned from the stage to the page better than others, and according to Lydon — along with Kindred, one of the collection’s only two editors — the implicit humor in more than a few stories would’ve suffered a loss in translation had they been forcibly adapted into book format.
Lydon said she and Kindred enjoyed an unusually permissive working relationship with their publisher, Abrams Image.
“They allowed us to publish the kind of book we wanted to,” she said. “There really wasn’t any drastic censoring — thank God, because the raw details and uncensored truth is what makes these stories so appealing.”
Lydon cited the variety of stories included as contributing to the richness of the overall collection.
“There are some that take on more of a psycho-sexual (if you will) journey through an occurrence and are more delicate and narrative with their delivery, while others can be a little more … to the point,” she said. “That’s the beauty of this compilation, though. You can go from one story that talks about the emotional complications of being a virgin mime to a story of a drugged encounter with a little person to a crassly descriptive threesome with neighbors.”
Of the book’s 37 pieces, only 36 are of the short story ilk — a sonnet scribed by contributor Eric W. Pearson wraps up the text proper before a ridiculously funny glossary of lewd colloquialisms and sexual slang. The unorthodox inclusion of a crossword puzzle to test comprehension of the terms defined in the glossary only contributes to collection’s quirky charm.
Beyond their comedic value, Lydon recognizes the value of post-coital discourse as therapy. Even regarding contributors like “Security guard, female,” “The Flying Buttress” and “Jane Doe” who chose to remain anonymous, she doesn’t believe that they’re missing out on the full cathartic experience of owning up to their embarrassment by way of an honest byline.
“I think it’s cathartic no matter how you frame or sign it,” Lydon said. “I can understand the need that some of our contributors had to remain ‘pseudonymous.’ It’s one thing to perform a monologue one night in a small comedy theatre in [New York or Los Angeles], it’s another to have it in print for life, with your name on it.”
Lydon admitted to initial reluctance to credit herself for “The Farting Rapist” when the book went to print.
“I had my doubts about having my name on my story, but at the end of the day I thought ‘What do I have to lose? It’s the truth,’” Lydon said. “And it’s not like any of us are alone.”

LCD Soundsystem, the gargantuan punk-dance-pop project of James Murphy, has been a highly dependable source of tunes that blur the line between innovation and accessibility. Over eight years and throughout two albums, Murphy has operated in this area as an antihero of hip. On This Is Happening, his third and allegedly last album as LCD Soundsystem, Murphy succeeds in blurring those boundaries more fantastically than ever before. This Is Happening represents the culmination of Murphy’s artistic work thus far, his artistic pinnacle; and if it is indeed his last, well, there isn’t a better way to leave.
Even without this knowledge, the album would still sound like a farewell, a fact of which Murphy is undoubtedly aware. The album standout “All I Want” is the aural manifestation of fleeting moments, and it is simultaneously beautiful and heartbreaking.
Murphy tears through “All I Want” with a heroic finality. The chorus All I want is your pity / All I want is your bitter tears is a throwaway, a lovely little nothing that is wisely awash with screechy guitars and poppy keys. But when Murphy promises, From now on, I’m someone different / Because it’s no fun to be predicting, the massive scale of the album up to that point feels justified and frighteningly definitive, as if this is the last song you’ll ever hear.
Though “All I Want” is only the halfway mark of this album, it’s still a hugely important moment in the album’s progression. The song marks the first time it really, truly hits listeners: This is happening.
Murphy has always been very self-aware, and the album title’s reflexivity is pertinent in more ways than one. On first listen, the album seems to fly by the skin of its teeth, an immediate and affecting portrait for the now generation. Left behind piano flubs and uncut comments begin and end some tracks, giving the feel of a tossed off accidental masterpiece in the vein of Skip Spence’s OAR, an album essentially summed up by Murphy’s title.
Murphy is too meticulous for that, and This Is Happening is also an apt, bittersweet moniker for the carefully crafted career retrospective album that he’s created.
From the tongue-in-cheek earworm “Drunk Girls” to the overtly Daft Punk-y “One Touch,” Murphy hits all the familiar bases, but he really is covering new ground here. Lyrically and thematically, This Is Happening is a distinct departure from the first two albums. Paranoia, sass and — for the first time — personal detachment are the sensations driven home in these highly danceable tunes. Surely the recording of the album in Los Angeles, away from Murphy’s native New Jersey, was an influence, but there is more going on than that.
This is happening. This could be the last audible document of James Murphy’s genius by way of LCD Soundsystem, and it’s clear he knows it just as well as everyone else.
It’s hard to keep that nagging sensation separate from the listening process when it so obviously affected the recording. It is easy, however, to say that any and all effects are positive. Murphy’s strength, since the opening volleys of “Losing My Edge,” has been his honesty — about music, himself and everyone else. And through pulsing rhythms, ’70s-style guitar and incredibly adept vocals, sincerity shines through on all tracks. This isn’t just a goodbye letter; it’s a “Dear John.” Murphy is saying everything he’s ever wanted to say and it is absolutely liberating to hear it.
If this is indeed the end, and if the love he takes is equal to the love he makes, this album alone earns him a lifetime supply. It is an astonishing, danceable and heartfelt finale to a short but infinitely impressive catalogue of a band that nobody saw coming, and it is an absolute blast to listen to anywhere, anytime.
Considering the consistently supreme quality of his work, this won’t be the last to be heard from James Murphy — it’s just the best so far.

Ten years ago this month, Ridley Scott’s Gladiator, that year’s Academy Award winner for best picture, first appeared in theaters. So if Friday’s release of Robin Hood — another action-adventure period piece starring notoriously temperamental Australian thespian Russell Crowe, with Scott again at the directorial helm — awakens in you an uneasy sense of decadal déjà vu, it’s not without cause.
The film offers audiences insight into the backstory of the famed British rogue bent on the redistribution of wealth. When Robin Longstride (Crowe), a skillful common archer in King Richard the Lionheart’s army, is asked by the king for his frank opinion of the unpopular religious crusades from which they had just returned, Robin answers the king the only way he knows how: with unfailing honesty. Clapped in the stocks as a reward for his truthfulness, he and his men miss out on the battle that takes the king’s life, but are freed in time to witness a French ambush that ends in the death of the knights bringing news of his demise back to London.
Armed with the conviction that the only thing distinguishing a common archer from a man of nobility is his clothing, Robin adopts the vestments and identity of Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge), whose dying request was that Robin return a sword taken in spite long ago to Robert’s father, Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow).
Once in Nottingham, Robin finds he must commit himself even further to the ruse to protect the now-widowed Marion (Cate Blanchett) from the threat of losing the Loxley family’s land when the aging Walter dies.
Scott, whose directorial credits run the gamut from the 1979 sci-fi horror flick Alien to 1991’s girl-power western Thelma & Louise, has increasingly tended toward historical pictures in recent years. Since his 1977 debut The Duellists, set during the Napoleonic wars, he appears to have only grown more interested in perfecting his approach to period dramas.
Though Robin Hood’s startlingly beautiful cinematography and impeccable costumes could be quickly chalked up to the natural beauty of the British geography and the established talent of Scott’s frequent collaborator, costume designer Janty Yates, it would be a mistake to forget that Scott has made a career out of his uncompromising eye for detail. Scott’s films provide an immersive, total experience precisely because he is so unwilling to spare any expense in transporting audiences to faraway lands, as they would have appeared long ago. For this painstaking attention to detail, which is patently evident in Robin Hood, the name Scott has made for himself as a consummate and meticulous filmmaker is well deserved.
Robin Hood marks Scott and Crowe’s fifth collaboration to date, the first being 2000’s Gladiator, a favorite of critics and moviegoers alike, and the second being A Good Year in 2006, roundly dismissed as a flop. Scott’s eagerness to work with Crowe is surely a product of the actor’s famously intense approach to his trade — his process is said to resemble Robert DeNiro’s “method acting” tactic of embodying his character around the clock, on and off set.
When an actor experiences the level of success in a particular genre that Crowe has enjoyed in historical epics, he forever runs the risk of being typecast. In the case of Robin Hood, however, the very decision to cast Crowe as the outlaw hero was enough to defy expectations. Conventionally imagined as charismatic, svelte and light-of-foot — perhaps charming, even, as far as bandits go — Robin Hood experiences a total reinvention with Crowe’s gruff, intensely physical interpretation of the legend.
Crowe’s portrayal flies in the face of audience expectations established by the likes of cinema legends Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn and marks an altogether different treatment from Kevin Costner’s essentially same role in 1991’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, in which Costner gives a more traditional performance as a seductive lady-killer of a bandit.
After experiencing Scott’s vision of 20th-century England, it’s clear that only a performance like the intensely physical and hyper-masculine one Crowe gives as Robin would fit with the brutish world presented by the veteran director in Robin Hood.
Blanchett’s Marion is similarly rough around the edges, a far cry from the definitively feminine Maid Marians popularized in contemporary lore by the pretty she-fox in Disney’s 1973 animated feature Robin Hood and Audrey Hepburn in 1976’s Robin and Marian, in which Hepburn starred opposite quintessential man’s-man, Sean Connery.
Another safe casting choice in the realm of historical dramas, Blanchett has already earned an Academy Award for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese’s period piece The Aviator (2004) and has garnered international acclaim for her performance as the queen of England in 1998’s Elizabeth and its sequel nine years later, Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
In all of these, Blanchett portrays unequivocally strong women. And given Scott’s history of directing talented actresses in films — such as Alien and Thelma & Louise — that highlight their female characters’ power, it was only a matter of time until the two collaborated.
From her character’s outspoken opposition to the crown’s unfair taxation to her muted, practically unreadable reaction to news of her husband’s death, Blanchett’s Marion is a stoic anti-damsel whose impenetrable shell Robin is only able to break into after proving himself with acts of bravery, chivalry and vigilante heroism spread throughout many months in his role as surrogate husband.
If only to see the unlikely evolution of an amorous dynamic between the similarly steely characters of Robin and Marion, Robin Hood is worth watching. Solid performances by William Hurt and Max von Sydow round out the film, but they only complement — without overshadowing — the centerpiece performances by the Australian-born Crowe and Blanchett.

Last week, thousands of proud seniors braved the intense California sun and the earliest Friday morning wake-up call since their freshman year general education classes to participate in the university’s 127th annual commencement ceremony.
Graduate students who received their postgraduate honors joined them.
Thomas Curry | Summer Trojan
Also in attendance were five honorary degree recipients — William J. Bratton, John Hood, Ting-Kai Li, Festus G. Mogae and Esa-Pekka Salonen — each of whom was recognized for his contributions to society.
After exhausting all possible photo combinations of the “Fight on” sign and awkward shoulder-to-shoulder hugs, a new crowd left campus toting degrees from the University of Southern California, just like the 126 classes before them.
What a missed opportunity.
Despite all of the pomp and circumstance involved in the commencement ceremony, the graduation took a decidedly conservative stance in response to calls to recognize a marginalized student group.
In April, the Japanese American Citizens League passed a resolution urging USC to award honorary degrees to American-born Japanese former students. The gesture would recognize those students forced to discontinue their studies because of government-mandated internment during World War II.
USC did not.
To be fair, the university has recognized these Nisei students in the past, having awarded them honorary alumni status during an Asian Pacific Alumni Association gala in 2008. But why the reluctance to go the extra step?
In 2009, the University of California Board of Regents voted to suspend a long-standing ban on the awarding of honorary degrees with the intention of recognizing the Nisei scholars. Accordingly, UCLA awarded 48 honorary degrees to their former students during a special ceremony on campus Saturday.
It appears there is a legitimate case to make for the Nisei scholars.
USC’s first listed criterion for awarding an honorary degree is “to honor individuals who have distinguished themselves through extraordinary achievements in scholarship, the professions, or other creative activities, but who may not be widely known by the general public.”
While it was Executive Order 9066 that mandated all Japanese American citizens be sent to internment camps, there were additional obstacles for such students at USC — the only West Coast university that refused to release their academic transcripts.
Despite this, the group of roughly 130 students went on to demonstrate courage, faithfulness and loyalty in their lives, as recognized during the honorary alumni ceremony.
It’s reassuring that the University Honorary Degrees Committee and Board of Trustees are so tight-fisted with the conferral of these doctorates. Though others in the realm of postsecondary academia have been much more liberal with such honors (see Dr. Kermit the Frog, Southampton College ’96) exclusivity validates and preserves the value of such an honor.
It seems fitting, however, to exercise some degree of liberty with regard to the honorary degree policy; if there ever were an exception, wouldn’t this group be a compelling candidate?
It’s hard to imagine that anything similar could take place in today’s society, much less with the diversity present on campus today. But while the current administration is not directly responsible for anything that took place over a half-century ago, they had the opportunity to right the wrongs done upon these members of the Trojan Family with a symbolic gesture befitting of the recipients.
An honorary degree in itself is not going to serve as a mea culpa on behalf of the university. To think otherwise would be insulting.
But, it is increasingly obvious that the Nisei scholars are as deserving to be degree holding members of the Trojan Family as any of the recent graduates.
The Board of Trustees needs to reconsider its stance on awarding honorary degrees to a group that has been waiting to commence for far too long.
Soojin Yoon is a senior majoring in public relations. 
Very well-written. A tad bit verbose, but very lucid, effective writing on a very complex issue.
As a third generation Trojan alumnus whose parents attended our University during WWII, I say to the author of this articulate editorial: “Amen” and “Fight On!”
