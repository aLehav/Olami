Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences hosted the “2016 Presidential Election Conference” on Tuesday, bringing notable strategists, political consultants, journalists and professors to campus to sum up and debate the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election. 
The last panel of the conference featured Joel Benenson, a pollster for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s chief campaign strategist in the 2016 race; Alex Castellanos, a political consultant for President-elect Donald J. Trump; Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant for Jeb Bush’s campaign; Bill Carrick, a political consultant and strategist; and professors of political science and communication Diana Mutz and Lynn Vavreck, who teach at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Los Angeles, respectively.
Discussion focused on the strengths and flaws of the candidates and their campaigns, as well as concerns regarding the future of political parties, Congress and the presidency as a whole.
“People tend to vote for what they perceive they did not get the last time because every four years they get to pick something,” Murphy said. “The biggest driver is partisanship; most of the people who voted for Trump did so because he was the Republican.” 
Murphy said that they did the same for Clinton because she was a Democrat. He also said the divide between the politicians in Washington, D.C. and the people who felt that their wages were stagnating contributed to the election of Donald Trump.
“A guy comes along who’s famous for being on television and getting stuff done. A guy who wrote a book called The Art of the Deal,” Murphy said. “A guy totally divorced from politics. President Obama was perceived as gridlocked, and by many voters [this was seen as a] weakness.”
Benenson emphasized the flaws of both political parties and the need to modernize the system post-election through taking into account the needs of the citizens, strengthening democracy and the economy.
“There was something very different at work in this election. Democrats, as a party, even though we won the popular vote six out of seven times, can’t just be a presidential party,” Benenson said. “We have to do more work in some states where we actually have a much better message for economically disadvantaged people, including white voters and voters of color.”
Benenson added that the Republican party was also going to be tested, especially with a future Trump presidency and Republican-majority House of Representatives and Senate.
“They are going to be under a microscope. [Trump’s] going to have to show leadership in a way he has not done so at all in his campaign,” Benenson said. “He needs to speak out earlier and sooner.”
Castellanos discussed the lack of civilian trust in the government. 
“What are people actually dissatisfied with? Maybe it’s the product they’re buying with their votes that’s not working to the degree that they have paid for and invested in,” Castellanos said. “What if big structures can’t keep up with a dynamic and changing society, and what if we need others tools in our toolbox to govern ourselves other than the big factory in Washington?”
Mutz echoed Castellanos’ sentiments, citing evidence from her population-based survey experiments.
“What people are responding to is not political differences, issue differences, ideological differences; what they’re responding to is the tone,” Mutz said. “They are mad that nothing is coming out of Washington because nobody can agree on anything.”

Undergraduate Student Government Senators passed the Sanctuary Campus resolution at the USG meeting on Tuesday, with all but one senator voting yes. The resolution called on the administration to protect and support USC’s undocumented students, staff and their families by not sending information about their immigration status to government officials. 
Sen. Leena Danpour, who voted against the resolution, raised concerns about the effect that the resolution as is would have on University funds, due to President-elect Donald Trump’s statement that cities that declared themselves sanctuaries would not receive federal funds. Speaker Paul Samaha, however, responded that over 200 universities, many of which are public and therefore rely largely on federal funding, have already declared themselves sanctuary campuses and have not seen their support withdrawn. 
Following this vote, Treasurer Christian Edwards gave an update on the funding branch of USG, highlighting organizations that were utilizing their funds to put on events, such as Troy Camp, Commedus Interruptus and Corpus Callosum. So far, the funding branch has allocated around $142,000 to member organizations out of approximately $353,000, which is around 40 percent of the budget. According to Edwards, this is because the spring semester usually has more expenses than the fall semester.
Sen. Daniel Million then gave an update about his past and present projects, starting with the Trojan Family Welcome Back Festival in the beginning of the year. 
“The purpose of this was to bring our community together and showcase the different cultures at USC,” Million said. 
Million said he is also interested in finding a more accessible zero percent interest emergency loan system for students who need to take out loans during the school year, and in passing a resolution to make printing free on campus.
Million also mentioned that he is working with the Global Leadership Connection high school conference, which he was involved with in high school. The conference promotes leadership development in high school students, and Million, a first-generation college student, believes this program helped in his path toward college. He wants to implement a mentorship program with USC students and students from nearby high schools.
Sen. Alanna Schenk also gave a presentation on her project to create a housing index of University-owned and non-University-owned housing, and working with the head of USC Hospitality to create a cooking series to help students who can’t afford to buy all their meals but also don’t know how to cook. Another of her projects has been to help “rebrand” veterans and debunk any misconceptions through Veterans Awareness Week. Schenk is also looking into getting a widget on the MyUSC homepage for veterans called VETSC, similar to the one for international students. 
Sen. Daniel Newman focused on two initiatives this semester, which he said was so he could put in his full effort and make greater progress than what would have been made on many smaller projects. His first initiative was to make spring admits feel more welcome on campus. For example, spring admits who moved to the University Gateway apartments in the fall to be closer to the USC community are being penalized by not having priority for the USC Village next year because they are not currently in USC Housing. 
“A lot of spring admits don’t feel like Trojans until they get to campus in the spring,” Newman said. “Something I’ve really been working on is making them feel like they’re at home when they get that letter in the mail.” 
Newman is also continuing to follow through on his initiative to make USC smoke- and tobacco-free. The proposal has been passed by the necessary bodies to be seriously considered by the administration, and Newman hopes it will come to fruition.
Program Board Executive Director Krystal Chavez then proposed a bylaw amendment that would formalize a process for changing the name of an assembly in program board. This was prompted by the Women’s Student Assembly’s desire to change its name to the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment.
“We want to change our name to make it more inclusive and more accurate based on the work that we do,” said Vanessa Diaz, the director of WSA. “We want to make our organization more welcoming to people who are gender nonconforming and [for] men, because feminism is for everyone.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Alanna Schenk organized a career fair for veterans. Schenk did not work on the career fair; that was the Veterans Resource Center.
Be careful what you wish for. You stand to lose federal funding.You stand to lose donors. Hell, you might not have enough money to put clothes on Tommy Trojan.
What a total bunch of rubbish.  What a largely meaningless, self-serving, and generally ignorant group.  
On the issue of sanctuary cities … never mind the possibility of losing federal funding – it’s simply the WRONG thing to do.  We are a nation of laws, and a vote to protect those who are not in compliance is preposterous.  It’s a particularly shameful position to take on a university campus, where so many students legally attend under the provisions of student visas.  What a rude and disgusting and non-inclusive message you are sending legal immigrants and students.
On the issue of the Women’s Assembly changing its name … Whatever!  Do what makes you feel warm & fuzzy inside, but just know that there are two genders according to science.  Know that gender is not fluid, nor a state of mind.  Know that people whose behaviour or appearance does not “conform” to their gender is fine, but does not change their gender.  Know that women’s “empowerment” is fine …but deconstructing, redefining, or otherwise rendering what it means to be a woman as indistinguishable from what it means to be a man, is damaging and certainly not “empowering”.
It’s literally sad to see the increasing amount of time students spend doing anything but learning.  They just think they know everything already I guess.  I worry about how utterly unprepared so many will be when life & truth hit them down the road.
Stupid students denying the US Constitution.
Sanctuary campus?
Stupid leftist post modern secularists without a clue of what it means to work in real life.

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanShaping faith · Diane Winston, an associate professor at the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism and the Knight Center Chair in Media & Religion, spoke on modern perceptions of religion Tuesday.
Speakers evaluated the portrayal of religion in the media and how this has shaped the public’s view on different denominations at the final panel event in the “Race, Faith, and Violence” series Tuesday evening at the University Club. 
The semester-long series of speaker events was hosted by the USC Caruso Catholic Center in partnership with the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, and featured visiting scholars Rabbi Reuven Firestone, a Regenstein professor in medieval Judaism as well as a member of the School of Religion faculty; Amir Hussain, a professor who teaches courses on Islam and world religions at Loyola Marymount University; and Pim Valkenberg, a professor of religion and culture at the Catholic University of America. 
Tuesday’s event, “Perception and Reality: Religion in the 21st Century,” focused on the three major global religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Hussain explained that “legacy media,” which includes traditional outlets such as newspapers, radio and TV stations, will find an “enemy” for America to see. Hussain said that right now, this group is the Muslim community, but that negative news reporting against Muslims is not a unique occurrence, as it has happened all throughout history.
“It’s melodrama, and melodrama means good guys and bad guys,” Hussain said. 
Diane Winston, an associate professor of media and religion at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said that there is little interest in concepts like balance and democracy because media focuses on what gets the most attention. Moderate people, she said, are just as religious as extremists, but it is the extremists who are being reported by the media.
“Most of the time when ‘legacy media’ reports on religion, it’s in the terms of conflict,” Winston said. “If it’s not sensational and scandalous, then it’s about how people are opposing each other.”
Firestone added that people’s perceptions of media outlets are shaped by their coverage of religion as well. He talked about how, when he speaks to his Israeli friends about The New York Times, they believe the newspaper to be very pro-Palestinian. However, when he speaks to his Palestinian friends, they believe The New York Times to be a very pro-Israeli establishment.
“The media is certainly distorting, whether it’s intending to or not, our vision of religious communities,” Firestone said. “In the minds of people, what we see and read we interpret in ways that we are all programmed to interpret. It has meaning to us, and that affects the way we look at the world around us, and it’s hard to transcend this.”
Valkenberg added that the idea of perception and reality is a bit more complicated, because every take on reality is situational. This plays into the idea that because the American society has a secular overlay, there is a price for a lack of religious literacy from reporting staffs within news outlets. Their perceptions of different religious communities are not necessarily the same realities that the religious communities live in.
“Hussain explained that “legacy media,” which includes traditional outlets such as newspapers, radio and TV stations, will find an “enemy” for America to see. Hussain said that right now, this group is the Muslim community, but that negative news reporting against Muslims is not a unique occurrence, as it has happened all throughout history.”

Now why might that be?  Well it might be because Islam is negative in so many ways.  Today there are 56 OIC members, and in each country we can see Islam’s deleterious impact.  Misogyny, no free press, no religious freedom, no freedom of speech.  A barbaric and cruel Sharia law where hands are cut off, gays are hung, women are stoned to death.  A non-functioning society where scientific research is all but nothing, inventions are all but non-existent.
Other than this and a thousand other defects it is little wonder Islam has been looked down upon since its inception.

6.  Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria on Islam
“I am afraid that God has sent these men to lay waste the world”.
7. Gregory Palamus of Thessalonica on Islam
“For these impious people, hated by God and infamous, boast of having got the better of the Romans by their love of God…they live by the bow, the sword and debauchery, finding pleasure in taking slaves, devoting themselves to murder, pillage, spoil and not only do they commit these crimes, but even – what an aberration – they believe that God approves of them. This is what I think of them, now that I know precisely about their way of life.”

In a time and society in which a college degree is highly valued — and almost required in order to obtain a job — many high school graduates aim to head off to higher education institutions all over the country. Many students coming from affluent or educated environments and backgrounds expect and yield to the same idea of attending a college and obtaining a degree. However, that is not the case for all high school seniors in the country, and their stances are often ignored — despite their number being much larger than their college-educated counterparts (only one out of three people in America hold bachelor’s or higher degrees). The choice not to pursue a college degree often a financial one; the economic burden of paying for higher education might seem to outweigh the benefits of earning the degree. While the financial burden is a valid concern, the problem extends much further than that. Many of these students are not even exposed to what a college education offers in the first place — even to those who are not the most academically inclined.
USC hosts many community engagement programs, such as Kicks for Kids, Joint Educational Project and Trojan Youth Soccer League. These programs bring younger students directly from the surrounding community and allow them to interact with USC students to foster a learning and enriching experience. There are numerous other projects and programs that are affiliated with the University that aim to reach out to adjacent schools, such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative. I think that these programs are necessary across many college campuses in the country. By directly exposing students to the many different resources and opportunities that the college experience offers, it creates motivation and incentive for the students to spend their next four years there. By allowing students to incorporate themselves into the school academically as well as physically by being on campus, college seems to be a more tangible and realistic goal for students.
One of the primary reasons for the small rate of high school seniors going to college in the United States is due to the financial costs of the private and public universities. USC is no stranger to high costs; the cost of attendance is around $70,000 this year. While the price tag is daunting, USC offers a wide range of merit scholarships; around a quarter of the freshmen class in 2014 were recipients of such scholarships. Around two-thirds of the student population are offered and accept and financial aid from USC. The need-blind admission process also allows the students to apply to the school without being worried about the cost of attendance as a possible hindrance to gaining admittance to the university. The Neighborhood Initiative (despite its premature beginnings in sixth grade) is a prime example of this financial assistance that USC offers to the underprivileged students in the neighborhood; upon the completion of the program and admittance into the university, the students are given a full scholarship during their four years at USC. The financial aid that this program rewards to its scholars is life-changing, as it offers a four-year college education for free. 
 The demographics of USC do not reflect that of the surrounding community; On top of that, the selectivity of the school as well as its financial costs create an invisible wall of “elite” students versus the local students. But this wall is created by a lack of communication and stereotypes. By engaging in these programs, the students living near USC can catch glimpses of a college life as a student. By allowing students to familiarize themselves with the college, it becomes natural for them to attend a college, if not USC. It is up to our community to ensure our gates are not walls between ourselves and the community. It’s time to foster an ultimate transition from high school to college.

As someone who’s dedicated more than a little time to pontificating about how conservatives need to change up their economic and social messages to be competitive in the future, the 2016 Republican wave was a shock for me. It’s forcing me to reconsider a lot of what I thought before the election. Nowadays, the market for reformish ideas on the center-right would appear to be slimmer than it was on Nov. 7th.
With Donald Trump in the White House and Republican majorities in the House, the Senate and the statehouses, many will come to the conclusion that Republicans won this election because of their ideas and innate appeal among the electorate. By that line of thinking, the new Republican majority, led by Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will more likely than not believe they have a mandate to do what they’ve been promising to do — roll back government regulations and transfer programs, cut taxes on the rich and on corporations, repeal and replace Obamacare and more. The conservative agenda post-Obama has been articulated throughout the Obama presidency, and it will now get its day in the sun.
I don’t particularly like this agenda, and of course I have my own 10-point plan for GOP policy reform I’d be pushing if I were in any place to push it. But my own personal preferences are not my only reservation with the current GOP majority’s agenda.
The big thing is, there’s a lot of room for policy overreach on the Ryan-McConnell side, and a lot of room for buffoonery and incompetence on the Trump side. The last time an incompetent Republican President and supply-side Republican Congress tried to slash the safety net, cut back critical sector regulations and lower taxes on the very wealthy was back under President Bush, and the experiment did not go well — most of the plans failed, and the Republicans lost Congress shortly thereafter. There’s no reason to expect, should the GOP push through such an agenda now, that the same won’t happen again.
I fully expect the GOP — the Ryan-McConnell side, at least — to overplay their policy hand, sensing a mandate that isn’t there. If that happens, it’ll get a well-deserved whooping from the Democrats in 2018 and 2020, the big question being what the now-distraught Democratic Party has evolved into by then.
Meanwhile, as The New York Times columnist David Brooks noted, President Trump will more likely than not stumble and tweet his way into an impeachment-worthy scandal of some sort, if his inexperience and incompetence don’t destroy his reputation first. Ironically, Trump’s probably the most “moderate” Republican on economics in power today, opposing entitlement cuts and supporting massive spending increases in infrastructure and the like. We have yet to see whether those initiatives will overpower the Ryan-McConnell ones, but it’s not too far out there to assume Trump might soon eliminate any presidential efficacy he might presently enjoy.
So on both ends, the house of cards that is the Ryan-McConnell-Trump Republican majority in government rests on shaky foundations, and will likely collapse sooner rather than later at the hands of the same angry voters who delivered it. I’ve gotten most of my predictions wrong these past few years, of course, but given the President-elect’s ego and Congress’ ideological disposition to destroy rather than to create, I have a good feeling about this one.
The question is, what comes next?
A lot of the answer to that rests on the question of where the Democrats go from here. If they reform their center and start doing well in the Heartland, we might see a Bill Clinton-like resurgence. If they push further and further left economically and culturally, as many of their activists are suggesting they do, there will be a wide-open space in the political center, between the white nationalism of Trump, the supply-side priesthood of Ryan, and the progressive,  soft socialism of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. 
That space in the center, historically contested, could be fertile ground for new, reform-oriented conservatives and centrists to make headway. I’m not talking about Reformicons, those East Coast policy wonks who present a warmed-over Reaganism of funding gimmicks and tax contraptions. Their ideas are OK, but it seems that whoever exploits the gap will have to take the basics of the Trump equation — anti-elitism, economic nationalism, government reformism — soften them, expand their appeal to nonwhite population, and build on the ashes of Trump and Ryan from there. Governor-Elect Eric Greitens of Missouri, a Democrat-turned-Republican who ran on a reformist message, might be one candidate to lead this sort of charge.
The contours of such a new center/center-right are at best hazy and speculative right now, and won’t materialize unless the current GOP majority fails miserably. Assuming that that will happen, here’s to hoping some reform-minded anti-Trump Republicans get together in the coming months and plot next steps to build a shadow conservatism for these dark days. When the house of cards comes tumbling down, their time will come.

And what about the Democratic party, which lost everything so badly with a candidate who was corrupt to her very core?  Look at the man they are about to anoint DNC chair, a radical, anti-Semite named Keith Ellison.
Trump has his share of flaws, but you totally ignore the flaws of Mrs Clinton.
There are good and bad theories posited in this article.  We don’t yet know if a Trump administration ultimately will be positive or negative, but the overwhelming reality is that the Democrats did not loose because their “message” wasn’t heard loudly or broadly enough… They lost because their message was soundly rejected.  Much of America… indeed, roughly half, is sick and tired of the leftist rhetoric that has reached all-time madness.  Americans are sick of illegal immigration, particularly Democrats’ love affair with illegals, and their outright support of them (…drivers licenses, health benefits, sanctuary cities etc).  Americans are sick of hearing elected officials like Governor Brown and Mayor Garcetti proudly saying the illegals “can now come out of the shadows” and “drive to their jobs”.  Americans are sick of the double standard applied:  One set of standards for illegals who wish to drive, or attend college… and another for citizens or legal immigrants.  
Beyond all of that, Americans are sick and tired of the celebration of so-called “transgenders”, people who clearly have a sad but very real mental disorder – because not identifying with your gender is indeed a disorder.  Americans are sick of Democrats’ wholesale abandonment of science in their suggestion that gender is “fluid” or a “state of mind”.  Americans are sick of the willful confusion between sexuality and gender, whereby sexuality occurs across a spectrum, but gender is indeed binary.  Americans are sick of being told that their colleagues can use whatever bathroom they “identify” with, and that the rest of us must just deal with it.
In short, Americans are sick of being told they are xenophobic if they want immigration enforced.. or ignorant and sexist if they’re not buying into the transgender lie … or homophobic if they believe marriage is something straight people do by definition.  Americans are sick of being marginalized by these labels.  They are sick of the Democrats have shifted from a message of “tolerance and acceptance” to one of “promotion and celebration”.
This election represents a pendulum shift.  Democrats have moved us too far to the left over the last several years, and for better or worse, Trump was the mouthpiece that represented a shift back to the right.  And let’s be clear, there is nothing “alt right” about the above.  These positions are easily held by fair minded, loving and intelligent Americans who are ready for a return to thoughtful and reasoned thinking.
My, my, kids are so naive.   If anytning, conservative Republicans think Trump will be too moderate.  Name calling is an attack the Left n uses when they don’t have any basis for commentary.  Give this Admin a chance. The last time the GOP dominated like this was during the Reagan years and the economy was comp,e tell energized, UT it took 2 yrs to do it, considering the economy under Carter was in little to no growth mode, like the Obama yrs, 2 high from a GDP perspective are the worse 8 yrs since 1929.
Trump won because most Americans want smaller governemnt,  lower taxes, a thriving economy, better healthcare than the garbage of the ACA.  The overwhelming and dominant win by the GOP over the federal, state and local elections is due to the fact that liberal economics and governemnt policies do not work, are destructive to everyday American citizens, and we’re very concerned about where the Democratic Party and leadership wanted to take us; the future of our country down a road that we do not want to travel on.  
The Dem Party has become the New American Socialist Party with  POTUS who is aligned with the alt-left and the terrorist organization known as the Muslim Brotherhood.   Just look at what is happening in Europe, and 3ven in Dearborn MI.  This isn’t a passive refuge problem. It is a designed plan of invasion by the Islamic jihad to take over any lqnd, country, governemnt, locality and make it theire.  There is no merging of cultures or assimilation into the host country’s society.  It is like a virus and a very nasty virus.
These are reasons why the Dems lost.

Whether it’s moving to Los Angeles without a car, graduating high school early to move to New York or being dumped by a boy, Anna Kendrick is nothing short of entertaining in her first novel, Scrappy Little Nobody.
Scrappy Little Nobody is a collection of charming autobiographical essays by Academy Award-nominated actress Anna Kendrick, best known for her roles in films such as Up in the Air and Pitch Perfect. The autobiographical accounts recall Kendrick’s life from her early childhood to present day. Kendrick’s work reflects the sentiments of an awkward teenager (and adult) who begins to adjust to her life as an actress in Hollywood. 
The memoir takes readers through Kendrick’s life in her voice — the teenage years she spent acting and singing on Broadway, being socially awkward and attempting to fit with classmates in school and colleagues in Hollywood. Kendrick shares poignant and humorous stories in an insightful and mildly sarcastic manner. 
Kendrick makes jabs at herself, making references to experiences of being the smallest kid in her class, looking too young for her age, dealing with unrequited crushes, being bullied by other females and trying to make it in Los Angeles while her friends were in college. Chapter headings like “I’m not kool” and “I am a very very small weirdo” are successfully on-brand with her signature “cute quirky girl” personality, but could feel a bit overdone at times. 
Yes, Kendrick is intelligent, talented and beautiful, but it seems as though she tries a little too hard to downplay it by repetitively underscoring her awkward personality. It may seem as if she really wants to seem to be relatable, but in reality, being an A-list movie star who has been on Broadway and makes tons of money doesn’t exempt her from being an ordinary person with problems and quirks. 
Photo from Anna KendrickAnna’s antics · Academy and Tony Award-nominated actress Anna Kendrick’s first novel Scrappy Little Nobody brings her sharp wit and winningly wry observations to the page, recounting the many extraordinary, embarrassing and irreplaceable moments along her road to success.
Those who want to gift this book to their little cousins who are fans of Pitch Perfect should probably think twice due to the amount of profanity in this book. Kendrick gives fascinating and entertaining details of her romantic relationships and sexual encounters. She provides references of one of her ex-boyfriends, who said that she was too “eager and ready” and that these things were a “turn-off.” Her honest sentiments about being an inexperienced lover are refreshing and sweet, referring to the time she clumsily tried to make breakfast for a boy that she was seeing. 
Similar to bestsellers like Amy Poelher’s Yes Please and Mindy Kaling’s Why Not Me?, Scrappy Little Nobody is very conversational in style. Kendrick’s work is similar to reading a series of blog posts compiled into a novel. She delves more into personal analysis rather than her experiences on movie sets, making it clear that this novel is about who she is as a person and not her fame. 
She’s a “nobody” because no one knows her true identity. She’s “scrappy” because she’s feisty and is a force to be reckoned with even though she is awkward and small. A combination between personal and humorous, Scrappy Little Nobody is the kind of lighthearted reading that makes readers feel like they’re talking to an old friend. Overall, Kendrick’s memoir is a true reflection of her personality — witty and self-deprecating, but still vibrant and refreshing.

With finals week approaching, the USC community offers a wide range of interactive de-stressing activities for the student body. One organization in particular, Students with Fisher, is attempting to foster a connection with students and the USC Fisher Museum of Art through a De-Stress Craft Fair on Friday.
Hosted at the Fisher Museum Courtyard in Harris Hall, the event will allow students to engage in crafts and other artistic activities from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. Food will be provided, and students are encouraged to explore their artistic abilities through activities like making cards and sock monkeys.
Catherine Mai, the president of Students with Fisher, said that as a student with a passion for art, she hopes these events will provide exposure for the Fisher Museum and the amazing artwork it exhibits. 
“Most people don’t know much about the museum, and that’s what I’m trying to break,” she said. “By bringing people into fairs and festivals like this, we hope they will be exposed to Fisher and will want to learn more about it.”
Students with Fisher hosts occasional events, such as movie nights to an annual spring Celebration of the Arts, in attempt to engage students with the organization’s artistic endeavors. For this fair, the group aims to spread the joy that comes with creating crafts in a community environment. 
Students with Fisher will provide materials for students to create their own personal de-stress kit from the Health Center, alongside sock monkeys and cards. They are also bringing some nostalgic childhood crafts to the table, with coloring pages and crafting flowers from recycled paper. 
Outside student organizations are also invited to partner up with Students with Fisher to come up with a table activity during the fair. Many of the craft activities require inexpensive materials but are enjoyable, especially when done in a group. 
Overall, Students with Fisher hopes the fair will stimulate interest with the Fisher Museum’s art exhibitions and create a longstanding relationship with the student body. 
“The exhibits Fisher puts on every semester are amazing, and it really acknowledges art that USC students wouldn’t see at other museums around here,” Mai said. The De-Stress Craft Fair serves as an additional incentive for students to get their hands dirty with their own art, even just for a couple hours. 
Earlier in the fall semester, the Fisher Museum exhibited Latin American works in its Cuba exhibition, illustrating its dedication in presenting multicultural contemporary art pieces to the USC audience. It has also hosted a Roski Annual Student Exhibition in May 2016 to showcase the creativity and talent of the student body, regardless of an individual’s major. 
Currently, an exhibition titled A Generosity of Spirit: Celebrating the Gift of Eugene Rogolsky, MD is on display at Fisher, presenting an immersive collection of works by both amateur and professional artists. Students are encouraged to visit the exhibition shortly after their time at the De-Stress Craft Fair, as the museum is open from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.

Photo from WurstkücheBratwurst · Wurstküche is a German restaurant with Eastern European influences. Located in the Arts District, it is known for its sausage dishes.
I call my mom in Kansas City around the same time every day, a ritual we’ve developed over the past four years to bridge the 1,500 mile distance and time zone change between us. Our daily conversations are often bookended by her concerns about my well-being. “Are you eating enough? Make sure you’re getting enough sleep!”
Lately, perhaps with my own graduation looming, her words during our check-ins have become more wistful, even a little apologetic. “I wish I could have given you more experiences. I wish I could have taken you around the world,” she said to me recently.
Her remarks aren’t warranted. What I lacked in vacations to unfamiliar places was made up in frequent trips to local museums, galleries and libraries. Even now, I feel perfectly content with my childhood experiences, though I look forward to filling out my passport with an abundance of different stamps in the future. 
But, without fail, she will then paint a picture of a trip we will take to Prague, Czech Republic. Just like the fascination Paris holds over me, Prague has the same effect on my mom. She describes a city soaked in rich history, with its distinctive baroque architecture and medieval Astronomical Clock and Old Town Square. Even the modern buildings pay an homage to the Prague’s foundations with inspirational reverence. Through seeking and parsing through any information she can get on the city, my mom’s conclusion is that mystique and magic occupy every corner of the stone-lined streets. Seeing this through her wanderlust lens, I can’t help but feel a little bit moony as well. 
When soundbites of our daily dialogue played through my mind earlier this week while I was in line at Wurstküche, I dismissed it as random and nothing significant. The anticipation of going home before break always makes me miss the Midwest more than usual.
Upon closer look, however, whispers of eastern European influence preside over the restaurant. The location in the Art District might wrap Wurstküche in modern eccentricity, but the deep mahogany wood decor enveloping the restaurant is a nod to Luxembourg Bohemia. 
This is the case for Wurstküche’s menu as well. I sat down at the restaurant’s communal-style dining benches with the kielbasa, a Polish pork and beef sausage dressed with onions and mustard. With side order of twice-fried fries complemented by the cheese and walnut dipping sauce, the only thing to complete my spread was the fruli ale, a Belgian strawberry beer. The experience may not have been strictly Praguer, but the restaurant paid homage to the city’s traditional atmosphere.
In typical L.A. fusion fashion, and staying true to the Arts District’s tendencies to experiment, there are out-of-the-ordinary menu items labeled “exotic.” I wasn’t brave enough to try the rattlesnake and rabbit or the pheasant options, but my friends said these items had a delectable gaminess. The owners of the restaurant weren’t shy with their “gourmet” editions either — other intriguing menu options included the Austin blues and mango jalapeno sausages. 
Los Angeles, specifically my time at Wurstküche, helped me see the poetry in my mom’s vision. It’s essential to make the most of your surroundings, but it’s even more important to actually carry out an obscure dream.
During that call to my mom that night, I thanked her for all she had done for me over the years, optimizing the resources around her to expand my horizons. When she started apologizing again, I told her we should finally make concrete plans to go to Prague. Now, it’s looking like our passports will feature one more stamp come this summer.

Brain Chin | Daily TrojanTrojan honor roll · Junior three-way player Adoree’ Jackson is one of four players who were named to the All-Pac-12 First Team. Jackson was also named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year.
Tuesday morning, the Pac-12 Conference released its all-conference football awards and four Trojans earned first-team all-conference honors. Selections included junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson earning Defensive Player of the Year and redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold being recognized as the Freshman Offensive Player of the Year.
Jackson’s 51 tackles, four interceptions, 11 pass breakups and two fumble recoveries on defense earned him recognition as one of three finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back. 
Jackson is also one of four finalists for the Paul Hornung Award honoring the nation’s most versatile player thanks to an exceptional three-way performance this season with 19 punt returns for 302 yards (15.9 average) and two touchdowns, and 22 kick returns for 671 yards (30.5 average) and two touchdowns.
While his offensive role was diminished in 2016, Jackson still rushed for 49 yards on five carries and caught a 52-yard touchdown pass against Notre Dame last Saturday.
In that 45-27 win, Jackson had a historic day by collecting 291 all-purpose yards and also scoring on a 55-yard punt return and a 97-yard kick return. 
Along with Jackson becoming the first Trojan to win the Defensive Player of the year since linebacker Rey Maualuga in 2008, Darnold is the first Trojan since Matt Leinart to throw multiple touchdown passes in eight-straight games this season.
Darnold took over for Max Browne in week four against Utah, and has since rallied USC to a 9-3 overall record thanks to his 213-of-313 passing for 2,633 yards and a USC freshman-record 26 touchdowns with just eight interceptions. 
On the ground, Darnold rushed for 230 yards and two touchdowns, the most in a season by a USC quarterback since Reggie Perry tallied 254 yards in 1991. 
Joining Jackson on the Pac-12 First Team are redshirt senior offensive tackles Zach Banner and Chad Wheeler.
In terms of the Pac-12 second team, junior offensive guard Damien Mama, junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and sophomore running back Ronald Jones II were named along with defensive players sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith and redshirt senior defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu. 
After a win in the season finale sealed the Colorado’s fate as the Pac-12 South Champs, USC’s place as the 11th-best team in the new College Football Playoff rankings secures the Trojans a place in one of the New Year’s six bowl games. 
If Colorado loses in the Pac-12 Championship game, USC could secure a spot in the Cotton Bowl against the undefeated Western Michigan Broncos or even in the Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines if the Washington Huskies make their way into the College Football Playoff.
Washington and Colorado will battle for Pac-12 supremacy Friday at 6 p.m. in Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium.

Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanThrow it down · Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton is a spark off the bench for the Trojans and leads the Pac-12 in steals with 18 this year.
After three home games last week, USC (6-0) tips-off against the University of San Diego Toreros (2-4) at the Jenny Craig Pavilion in San Diego on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
The Trojans are off to their best start since the 2000-01 season (8-0), and their success can be attributed to their depth. Five players are averaging double digits, and freshman guard De’Anthony Melton is scoring 9.7 points per game. 
At times, Melton has looked like USC’s best player. Despite coming off the bench every game, he has been on the court at the end of every close contest. His crucial steal with 10 seconds to play at Texas A&M sealed the Trojan’s third victory of the young season. Three games later, Melton is the Pac-12 leader in steals with 18 on the season. Additionally, the 6-foot-4 guard is shooting a team-high 56 percent from the floor and 33 percent from three. He is also averaging 5.8 rebounds per game, third on the team, and 3.3 assists per game, second on the team.
Other newcomers have stepped up too. Louisville transfer, redshirt sophomore Shaqquan Aaron is second on the team in scoring and fourth in field goal percentage. Freshman Jonah Mathews, albeit streaky at times, has shown glimpses of stellar all-around basketball. He is only shooting 27.8 percent from 3 this far, but he will certainly raise that number as he continues to adjust to the collegiate level. Nonetheless, he is third on the team in assists with 12, and he is second on the team in assists-per-40-minutes with 5.1. Like Matthews, freshman forward Nick Rakocevic is also contributing 5 points per game. He adds 3.7 rebounds per contest and leads the team in rebounds-per-40-minutes with 10.7.
Head coach Andy Enfield has been able to play all 13 men on the roster this season, and he has eight in the rotation. No one plays more than captains junior guard Jordan McLaughlin (32.7 mpg) and sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright (30.0 mpg), so everyone should have fresh legs come conference play. 
Another good sign for the Trojans last week was that their offense came to life. The team had been shooting under 30 percent from behind the arc in their first three games, but USC shot 44 percent from downtown last week, making 37 3s. Boatwright’s return has certainly aided the Trojans. After two rough games versus Texas A&M and New Orleans, Boatwright averaged 19 points versus SMU and UCSB, making nine of 18 3s. 
In just their second true road game of the season, the Trojans will be targets of another trap game. The Toreros will be prepared for USC after a challenging schedule so far that included match-ups versus UCLA and Samford. The team can stretch the floor very well with three players shooting above 45 percent from 3. Senior forward Brett Bailey leads the Toreros in scoring at 17.5 points per game. In USD’s most recent game, a home loss to New Mexico State, Bailey posted 24 points, nine rebounds and a career-high seven assists. Sophomore guard Olin Carter III is second on the team in scoring at 16.0 points per game. Bailey and Carter have scored roughly 48 percent of their team’s points this season, so if USC can shut them down, they will make winning on the road a whole lot easier.
Last year, USC and USD met at the Galen Center in the Trojans home opener. USC won 83-45. Now, they try to sweep the home-and-home series and go 6-0 all-time versus the Toreros and 7-0 on the season.

I still have lingering disappointment from the 2006 Rose Bowl. I probably always will, as will any lifelong USC football fan. With maybe the best team ever in college football, USC couldn’t cap its reign of dominance with the national championship it deserved. The loss almost overshadowed the previous two national championships.
But it was OK, I told myself then. The Trojans would be back in the championship game. They would redeem that loss to Texas. Pete Carroll would cap off his USC dynasty with that one extra national title it deserved.
But he didn’t. The Trojans would still be the dominant team in the then-Pac-10 for the next three years. They would convincingly beat three different Big Ten foes at the end of those seasons, winning three more Rose Bowls. But midseason upsets during all three of those years knocked USC out of the national championship game. The Trojans’ 2008 loss at Oregon State on a Thursday night stings almost as much as the Texas loss — Jacquizz Rodgers triggers almost as many nightmares as Vince Young.
Then the dynasty collapsed. Pete Carroll left for the Seattle Seahawks. The NCAA sanctions hit. Oregon earned the next two national championship bids in the conference. Stanford beat the Trojans four times in a row. The Trojans had an exceptional 10-2 season in 2011, but were still ineligible for the postseason. They came into 2012 hyped as the preseason No. 1 team. They ended the season with a loss to Georgia Tech in the Sun Bowl. Then came the airport tarmac firing, the fan favorite quitting before a bowl game, the substance abuse dismissal and a beleaguered athletic director concluding a national search in his final, legacy-defining move by just letting the interim guy keep his job. 
And so the Clay Helton era began. 
It’s been discussed countless times if USC football could get back to where it once was under Helton. I’ve gone back and forth on it. His promotion felt rushed, the usual USC swagger Trojans had going into big games was nowhere to be seen and the pummeling by the Crimson Tide was more humbling than anyone could have guessed. 
My concern was that USC might float just above average for the next several years, but never get back to an elite status. Helton was safe. He wouldn’t have off-the-field issues. He wouldn’t overlook those overmatched Thursday night opponents. There would always be some natural draw for local stars to come play college football in the Coliseum. The Trojans would never be bad.
But there were legitimate doubts that Helton would ever be able to join the ranks of the elites like Alabama’s Nick Saban or Ohio State’s Urban Meyer. Could he excite recruits to play for him as well as former USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron — who, for the record, finally earned a full-time promotion with a big time program at LSU — could? Could he embody the swagger of Carroll? The more existential question, though, was could Helton make up for all the time that was lost and the damage that was done by so much instability? 
The answer that we’ve gotten so far in his first full season has been a resounding yes. The Trojans feel invincible again. Kirk Herbstreit called USC the one other team in college football besides Alabama that no one wants to play. The Big Ten could throw Wisconsin, Penn State, Michigan or Ohio State at us in the Rose Bowl, and I would be confident as ever in the Trojans to win. 
Meanwhile, for the other strongest programs in the Pac-12, it appears that they’ve missed their shot to take a hold of the conference. My concern going into the season was that the period of instability would have cost USC its chance to ever dominate the conference again, but that does not appear to be the case at all. 
Stanford did fairly and squarely beat the Trojans this year, but I have little doubt how that rematch would go if it were the Cardinal playing the redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold-led Trojans for the Pac-12 Championship game. It’s still to be seen if the Ducks’ precipitous fall this year from the top of the pack is just an aberration or the closing of their window of opportunity with former quarterback Marcus Mariota and former head coach Chip Kelly, but Oregon looks years away from really competing with USC. The Bruins had a nice three-year stint with the Victory Bell, and the injury to quarterback Josh Rosen proved to be crippling for the team, but UCLA still hasn’t been to a Rose Bowl since USC’s last appearance in 2009, and won’t make any bowl this year.
Emerging from this wild and crazy 2016 Pac-12 season are Washington in the North Division and Colorado in the South, both teams USC beat. Both have come closer to winless seasons in conference — Colorado was 1-8 in 2012 Pac-12 play, Washington lost all nine conference games in 2008 — than a Rose Bowl in recent memory. USC beat both this season, and I’m highly skeptical as to whether either will ever be favored in a matchup against the Trojans for the foreseeable future.
The adoption of the College Football Playoff before the 2014 season came eight years too late for Trojan fans. I’m still convinced the 2006, 2007 and especially the 2008 teams would have competed for the national championship if a four-team playoff had existed then. The three early losses this year are probably too many to justify putting the Trojans ahead of a two-loss Big Ten or Big 12 team in the CFP if regular season games are supposed to mean anything for leagues going forward. 
But USC football is back. The center of attention in the program isn’t the head coach — Helton is perfectly happy with junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who treated fans to three highlight touchdowns against Notre Dame, being the star of the show. Darnold looks and plays more like a bruising linebacker than the prototypical USC quarterback, but he will be on every Heisman shortlist next year if he maintains his strong numbers.
I’ve gotten to cover this team during not its most successful four-year period ever, but arguably its craziest and most interesting. The odds look very good that, after a seven-season hiatus, the team will be right back where it belongs on Jan. 1 — well, the Rose Bowl Game is actually Jan. 2 because New Year’s Day is a Sunday, but same thing. And by next year, the Trojans should be playing in their first ever College Football Playoff.

With the women’s basketball team coming off a big tournament victory in Alaska last week, the Women of Troy look to continue their winning streak, but will have to do so without the help of redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams after a season ending ACL tear in her left knee. While USC (5-1) defeated Long Beach State on Sunday, it was clear that the loss of Adams on the court was felt.
“She’s our glue,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “She’s a leader. She can shoot, penetrate and pass. It’s a huge loss for us.”
After losing Adams for the second part of the season last year because of injury and academic ineligibility, the team struggled to fill the void that she left. They went from being 12-0 with her in the starting lineup to end the season 19-13. This season though, Cooper-Dyke believes in the team’s ability to bounce back and succeed.
“Someone is going to have to step up their game,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It could be a combination of players, but I think we have the talent to do it. We are just young in some areas.”
The answer might be found in freshman guard Minyon Moore, who is leading the team with 17 steals this season and averaging 14.2 points and 5.2 assists per game. Moore has continually improved her game since the beginning of the season, whether it be her power in driving to the hoop, handling the ball with precision or coming in clutch with a 3-pointer. 
“I love the energy that Minyon brings when she comes in the game both offensively and defensively,” Cooper-Dyke said. “She really gives us a spark. I love what she is doing. She is a freshman and she is going to have some ups and downs, but I don’t allow her to use that as an excuse. I want her to not be satisfied with where she is, but to continue to get better.”
USC will need Moore as they head to No. 25 Texas A&M to take on the Aggies (5-0) this Wednesday. The Trojans have not defeated them since the 1980-1981 season. This year will be no easier than any previous ones, as the undefeated Aggies’ are led by guard Dani Williams, who is averaging 20 points per game, and forward Anriel Howard, averaging 12.8 rebounds per game. It will take a team effort to come out on top before heading to play Sacramento State on Saturday.
“We just have to stay focused in all aspects of our lives right now,” junior forward Kristen Simon said.

As the semester begins to wind down, I’ve taken some time off of writing weekly articles for this column. And I wanted to return with this piece… to simply talk. 
The last few weeks have been hard. Donald Trump’s win was very frustrating for me. My school workload picked up, and I’ve been so exhausted running between accomplishing the things I have to get done, being an adult, etc. However, in this chaotic mess, I’ve learned a lot… 
I’ll list it below and I hope some of you take something away from it: 
I hope you all are finishing off the semester strong. Looking forward to your questions next semester. But for now, have a good holiday season with your family!

USC students enjoyed a night of holiday spirit, free food and musical performances in Alumni Park at the Undergraduate Student Government’s Festival of Trees on Monday evening. The event featured the lighting of 15 miniature Douglas Fir trees that represented different organizations within USG. 
Organizers hoped to provide a space to celebrate the holidays and help alleviate the stress that many students face with the onset of finals. Kathryn Kelly, USG director of marketing, created the event after getting the idea from student exchange with Utah State University.
“We have a bunch of student organizations decorating the trees so it represents their organization, their mission and basically how they’re involved on campus,” Kelly said. “We have a lot of fun things to hopefully give students a break on finals week.”   
The organizations represented included the Environmental Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Latina/o Student Assembly, QuASA, Concerts Committee, Black Student Assembly, Residential Student Government, Office of Religious Life, Graduate Student Government, USC Helenes, Undergraduate Student Government and Troy Camp.     
Cindy Pineda, the executive director of the Latina/o Student Assembly, said that it was important that their culture was represented in the Festival of Trees. 
“We want to make a presence here and ensure that we do have a community,” Pineda said as she and her assistant director decorated their trees with traditional poinsettia flowers and gold ribbons. “Within our community and assembly, we are able to show some of our culture.”
The Office of Religious Life reached out to the USC Interfaith Council so that they would be more representative of all religions. Their tree included references to the major religions at USC on paper chains. 
Marla Ross, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science who helped decorate the Troy Camp tree, was excited about the holiday spirit. 
“It’s very festive, especially for people who don’t go home for the holidays, and I’m glad that we get to have a tree, because it’s an organization that means a lot to us,” Ross said. 
Students who attended the event could participate in numerous activities including a bounce house, do-it-yourself crafts, cookie decorating, a photo booth and a screening of Elf. They also lined up for free holiday mugs, sprinkles cupcakes and hot chocolate.
Senior Advisor of the USG Executive Board Riyana Chakraborty, a senior majoring in international relations and global business, said that this was one of the best USG events she’s been to.
“I think this event is one of USG’s finest, to be quite honest, and I’ve attended a lot of events hosted by USG,” Riana said. “I think it’s really special that they’re incorporating the holiday spirit.”
Many attendees agreed that the event accurately portrayed the holiday spirit, including freshman neuroscience major Dominic Mogue. 
“This event has been great. It’s so festive. I’m having so much fun,” Mogue said. “The highlight was definitely hearing ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You,’ because that’s my favorite Christmas song.”
A group of three freshman architecture students all enjoyed different aspects of the Festival of Trees and were glad they were able to come together.
“I really like the Christmas trees because they are beautiful and magical,” Virginia Leopard said. “I liked that they were real because they smelled really good.” She also enjoyed the bounce house, free food and Christmas music. 
Mary Perez, the second of the three, loved the bounce house because “[She] was with [her] two best friends,” she said, much to the celebration of the other two. But Charlene Ko thought waiting in line was the highlight of the event.
“Even though we had to wait, it was fun, because we were waiting with friends,” Ko said.
Erin McCeormick, a master’s student in social work, appreciated one tree in particular.
“I think my favorite is the one with the Chinese lanterns and the snowflakes on it,” McCeormick said, even though she missed most of the event. “If I had the chance I would go to every part of this event next year.”
Students can stop by on their way to class to see the trees, which will be on display until Dec. 2.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanDifficult choices · Michael Hutchings considered quitting football after his father’s death during his freshman year, but decided against it.
Senior Michael Hutchings has two favorite memories from four years as a Trojan. One at the beginning, one at the end.
His first came in November of his freshman year, when a team in transition with a new head coach and something to prove knocked off No. 5 Stanford in front of a sold-out home crowd. The team rallied, former quarterback Cody Kessler threw a key touchdown and a defense-heavy game ended in a 20-17 victory. 
The stadium shook with cheers as the final whistle blew. Fans streamed over the barricades and onto the field, with cell phones held high to record the madness. Hutchings didn’t start, didn’t record a single tackle all game. But standing on the grass of the Coliseum in the middle of the crowd, he felt like he’d finally made it.
A month and 29 days later, he felt as if his world was flipping on its head. 
He’d lost his father, his idol, the man he was named for, to a battle with pancreatic cancer that didn’t last half of a year. His father, who watched film and scouted opponents, who called him before each game to give him a rundown of suggestions and who taught him to love football.
His dad only saw him play a handful of USC games. He was hospitalized soon after moving Hutchings into his dorm. By New Year’s, he was too weak to open presents for his birthday. He died on a January afternoon, two weeks after turning 49.
It was a loss that Hutchings couldn’t shake. For him, football and family were intertwined, inseparable. Without his dad, Hutchings wasn’t sure what was left to love about the sport.
“It was hard,” Hutchings said. “It was easy to feel like there wasn’t much to keep playing for.”
He started skipping team meetings and coming to practices late. Clay Helton, an interim coach at the time, was told to keep an eye on him. For awhile, Hutchings considered just quitting football entirely.
Hutchings isn’t sure why he stayed. But he did, grinding through practices, staying steady through every head coach replacement and front page scandal. It wasn’t easy, he said, but it was worth it. The whole team took each season one practice at a time. They trusted in the future, that a season would come when it all would fall into place.
In 2016, Hutchings decided that this season, his last season, was the year. As a sophomore, he fell to second string and spent two years clawing his way back into the team’s rotation. But as a senior, he felt ready to leave an impression that wouldn’t fade easily.
“I had one year left and I didn’t have anything to lose,” Hutchings said. “I knew I wasn’t going to get any days back. There was no next year. I gave everything I had each day.”
The difference was noticeable to Hutchings almost immediately. He attacked every practice at spring camp and approached the locker room just as fervently, making sure to connect with each of his teammates.
In August, Hutchings was named a captain alongside Max Browne, Zach Banner and Adoree’ Jackson. A bright red “C” emblazoned his jersey as he started every single game, tying for the second most total tackles for the team. And through a shaky start and a roller coaster finish to his final season, Hutchings focused on being there for his teammates every game, every practice and every day.
It was a year to be proud of, a year with nothing to lose and everything to gain. And Hutchings made the most of it. Until this year, his father’s death was a weight, hanging heavily. But now, it’s a constant motivation.
“It made me grow off the field a tremendous amount,” Hutchings said. “It made me look at sports, look at football in a different way. I look at it as more of a privilege. It helped me grow to take a step back and appreciate everything that was in front of me.”
This year was a turning point for Hutchings. It brought him to his second greatest memory — Saturday’s game against Notre Dame — and the most recent, its vibrance still fading after a few days. 
He’s not sure what it was about the game, whether it was the pelting rain or the roaring student section or Jackson’s leap over a defender to sprint into the end zone. He recorded five total tackles, but Hutchings’ stats weren’t his focus at the end of the day.
It was something about the energy, the way his teammates grinned and laughed and hugged each other after every play. The sideline brimmed with excitement, and Hutchings fed off of it. It took until later, after the game ended and the locker room cleared out, that the weight of his final game in his home field sunk in.
“After, when everything was all done, it settled in that it was my last game,” Hutchings said. “Afterwards it hit me hard. This team, it means a lot to all of us. I’ve grown so much as a part of it and when you look back, it just means a lot more than you can say.”
Part of that has to do with Helton, a man Hutchings has known since he was 14, since he first considered putting on a USC jersey. He praises the head coach for his fierce loyalty and his determination to support and connect with each of his players.
But most of what Hutchings will take away from USC has nothing to do with post-game statistics or highlight reels. It’s the teammates, he says, the friends who have become close to brothers. He respects his teammates, looks up to them and learns from them.
“You’re just around all these guys who set great work ethics and great examples,” Hutchings said. “The game provides so much more than just playing. You learn to appreciate people a lot more and know that your problems aren’t the biggest. The fun, the team that I had during this time — that’s what I’ll take away.”
Hutchings likes to think that his greatest memory at USC isn’t made just yet. There’s one game left — the unannounced bowl game, a final chance for every senior to make their mark on the team.
After that, he’ll graduate in the spring, along with 13 other seniors on the team. He’s not sure what will happen then, what will come next.
But Hutchings know one thing for sure. 
In a few weeks, he’ll put on a jersey labeled “19” on the back and “C” on the chest. He’ll think about his dad, about the advice he would give if he could, and he’ll look for his mom in the stands. He’ll dance with his teammates on the field, cheer from the sidelines and throw hard hits when he can.
He’ll play as a Trojan, one last time. And for now, that’s the only thing Hutchings wants to worry about.
What an awesome story about an awesome Trojan.  Fight on!

Photo from Warp RecordsInto my mind · You’re Dead! is the fifth studio album by American music producer Flying Lotus. Each subsequent full-length album that Flying Lotus has released starts with a personal connection.
During my freshman year in college, Flying Lotus, one of my all-time favorite artists, dropped his best album to date. My first semester in college wasn’t the best, but this album was a nice way to cap it all off, even if I didn’t get a chance to listen to it until the semester was nearly over. As I looked at the lineup of guest artists and collaborators who would make for one hell of a misfit comedy movie, I sat in the furthest outdoor lounge of Parkside Arts and Humanities all alone on a cold December night and listened to this album in one sitting.
You’re Dead! is a conglomerate of multiple genres and aspects of music. There’s no way to put this album in a single category, but if I had to give a quick description of it, it’s a modern avant-garde electronic music album. The wide range of sounds that come from this album are nearly unparalleled, and I’m positive that there’s something for everyone in this outing from Flying Lotus.
In some moments, it’s avant-garde. The first two tracks, “Theme” and “Tesla,” are atmospheric, with instruments and sound effects that transition into Thundercat hammering away at notes on a bass with no clear direction, and the only sense of order is a frantic drum line in the background. In other moments, it’s Flying Lotus’ version of funk. “Fkn Dead” and “Siren Song” have the traditional elements of a jumping bass line psychedelic guitar that are characteristic of funk, but they also have the spacey and out-of-this-world nuance that is characteristic of Fly Lo. Sometimes it’s new-age rap; Snoop Dogg and Captain Murphy (Flying Lotus’ alter ego) make appearances on this album. On “Dead Man’s Tetris,” the two rap a couple of morbid and eerie bars with an equally off-putting hook over a beat that sounds like a remixed version of something you’d hear on an old-school NES game.
This was also my first true introduction into a concept album. Every single track is a small part of the larger overall themes that stem from death and the afterlife. Despite there not being too many actual spoken words on this album, it’s one of the deepest and well thought out projects from any artist in any medium. Every single track, every single instrument, every single sound effect that is played on this album is an exploration into the unknown and the existential. It dares to explore the question of “What happens when you die?” in addition to the possibility of life after death. It’s that deep.
Everything you need to know about this album can be summed up in one of the greatest songs Flying Lotus has ever put out: “Never Catch Me.” If anyone is looking for an example of music transcending its limitations, it’s right here. Insightful lyrics from one of the greatest artists of our generation, Kendrick Lamar, a showcase of prolific talent from Thundercat and prophetic production from Flying Lotus make for the best song of You’re Dead! and possibly Flying Lotus’ career. If you listen closely and intently enough, you can chart the process of Flying Lotus taking you through the experience of dying, death and being reborn again. If you don’t, it’s still a kick-ass song to play at anytime.
After listening to it for the second time, I knew that it was my personal favorite album of the year, something I still stand by today. I also texted my good friend Billy if he had listened to it yet, and despite being 4 a.m. in the Midwest, we had a good conversation about our love for this landmark in music.
When I went back home to Michigan for a week that winter, I stayed with Billy and remedied my homesickness. One night, his dad took us out to a Mexican restaurant in Detroit, and we listened to this album there and back. What I find interesting about this album is that I’m not specifically taken back to the moment where I first heard it or the place where I most remember listening to it. When I play this album, I’m not taken back to Parkside or the backseat of Billy’s dad’s Ford Escape. Every time I listen to this album, I make a new memory of the experience I have listening to it with a fresh set of ears, and that’s something truly special.

Photo from Design for AmericaShape the world · The Design for America team at USC is divided into different social groups like Team Education and Team Mobility.
“Everything that we see around us started with an idea.” This maxim guides Michelle Whang in her involvement with Design for America, a national organization that utilizes design to find solutions to problems facing society. With 36 American university branches, DFA helps USC students make  a positive impact on the surrounding community. Recent student projects focus on a spate of issues including the environment, art education and fostering conversations about gender in elementary and high school classrooms. 
This week, the DFA is hosting an upcoming Open Studio Night to highlight the past semester’s accomplishments and to recruit for the spring semester.
The Daily Trojan recently spoke with Whang, a member of DFA’s Team Mobility and Team Education, and Faith Wang, DFA’s Chief Financial Officer and Co-External Events Coordinator, about their work in the organization.
DT: What inspired you to get involved in DFA? 
MW:  I was inspired to get involved with DFA because I wanted to make a change outside of the classroom. I wanted to break out of the safe bubble surrounding me and step out to see real-world issues and learn about how I can play my part and give back to my community.
DT: Describe, in your own words, what the mission of DFA is. 
FW: Design for America aims to tackle problems and social issues in our community with human centered impact design. This means we focus on our users by working with them every step of the way, from defining our problem and gaining user insights, to building and testing our prototypes.
DT: What are your own interests in design?
FW: Design can be applied to so much. I’m excited to apply design to service projects I may be involved with in the future. DFA Nationals hosts a design workshop in China, and I’d love to someday volunteer there to teach design thinking in Chinese. 
DT: Name and describe some projects that you have personally worked on.
MW:  In Team Education, we believe that with proper education, there is no limit to a child’s potential. Through our product “The Dashboard,” we hope to provide a platform for students to intrinsically motivate themselves to achieve more by documenting their educational journeys in a holistic, visually aesthetic online portfolio. 
In Team Mobility, sponsored by Fiat Chrysler, we are working on creating a solution to combat the first-mile, last-mile problem. Los Angeles is very spread out and metro stops are infrequent, which leads to many low-income citizens not having convenient access to the metro. For these low-income citizens who may not own cars, smartphones or credit cards, we have set out to create a seamless, inexpensive form of transportation to take users exactly where they need to go at a very low cost.

For these low-income citizens who may not own cars, smartphones or credit cards, we have set out to create a seamless, inexpensive form of transportation to take users exactly where they need to go at a very low cost. We have developed an on-demand ride-sharing service for low-income people in Los Angeles that provides short rides to and from metro stations.
FW: My first semester at DFA I was on Team Mental Health, where my team and I built a card game that promoted healthy and positive discussion to tackle depression. Last semester, I worked on a project that ran an Instagram page, @authentic.la, an educational page about gentrification in downtown Los Angeles. In addition, we brought an art installation downtown where we were able to discuss with people from all walks of life their favorite memories in downtown Los Angeles.
DFA’s Open Studio Night will be held from 8 to 10 p.m. on Nov. 30 in URC 108.

With a new hairdo and without ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid at his side, The Weeknd released Starboy, an album that surpassed all expectations and revamped the genre of R&B after Beauty Behind the Madness.
With Starboy, The Weeknd completely entered the mainstream, taking his fans by surprise with an upbeat album unlike ever before. With the drop of the lead single “Starboy,” listeners became weary as the song featured beats and melodies mostly associated with pop music. Despite this, The Weeknd created an album different from his first few records: Trilogy and Kiss Land. Those featured a sexy, alternative R&B vibe that remains in but with higher beats. He was still able to maintain his general style and tone. 
As a whole, the album shows similarities with The Weeknd’s hit single from his previous album, “Can’t Feel My Face” in that although it continues to be R&B, it has pop features that make the music easier to listen to.
The album’s lyrics continue to highlight The Weeknd’s life filled with lust, sex and money. The sexually explicit lyrics featured on the album continue to be a symbol for The Weeknd. An example of this would be “Ordinary Life,” which epitomizes the sensual tone in Tesfaye’s music.
Aside from the recurring erotic lyrics, Starboy features music that is radio and dance ready like ‘Rockin’” and “Secrets” which almost sound like a mixture of retro ’80s beats and modern EDM, ready to be remixed. Singles “Starboy” and “I Feel it Coming” feature electronic music duo Daft Punk that provide an easy listen to The Weeknd’s commonly mysterious melodies and lyrics.
Photo from XO RecordsStar-studded · Starboy incorporates themes of the extravagance associated with the celebrity lifestyle, as well as discussing how the spotlight can make an entertainer fragile. “Starboy” was released on Sept. 22, following the announcement of the album and its accompanying artwork a day earlier.
Though The Weeknd does attempt to make his music more upbeat in Starboy, he still includes a few tunes with that aforementioned mystery and gloom, especially with the two tracks on the album that feature Lana Del Rey — the queen of mystery and gloom. The song “Party Monster” was co-written by Del Rey and features her vocals toward the end of the track, repeating the word “paranoid” and ending the song with a soft “you’re paranoid.” The two-minute interlude called “Stargirl Interlude” breaks the album up, setting the second half for a more indie-infused R&B, not seen as much in the first half of the album. Undoubtedly, featuring Lana Del Rey reminds the listener that yes, this is still The Weeknd.
Starboy also features rapper Future in both “Six Feet Under” and “All I Know” and rap icon Kendrick Lamar in “Sidewalks.” “Sidewalks” references The Weeknd’s humble beginnings in Toronto after dropping out of high school and building his way to being one of the most sought after singers currently in music. He also calls out one of his own first producers with the lyrics, “‘Cause too many people think they made me / Well, if they really made me then replace me.” Featuring Kendrick Lamar on “Sidewalks” diversified the record vocally, as Lamar’s commanding tone completely contrasted with The Weeknd’s smooth, seductive voice. “Sidewalks” is one of the best tracks on the album.
Overall, Starboy proved The Weeknd’s versatility and willingness to expand his audiences to more than alternative R&B listeners. In this effort, he created a record that stayed true to his style, while still opening the door to the mainstream. Starboy is not as strong as his last album, Beauty Behind The Madness, which directly reflected The Weeknd’s style while still having some of the greatest radio hits like “The Hills” and “In The Night.”

Adoree’ Jackson was just having fun.
Before fielding a Notre Dame punt late in the first half with USC ahead by a field goal, the junior turned to pump up the crowd — soaking wet from a steady rain — waving his arms and igniting a roar from the drenched faithful.
A few seconds later, Jackson was gone, taking the punt on a bounce, finding a seam and bursting through it for a 55-yard touchdown to grab control of the game for his team.
“I was being aggressive the whole game,” Jackson said.
He was just getting started.
Jackson finished with three touchdowns in Saturday’s 45-27 win over Notre Dame, scoring on a punt return, a kick return and on offense — each one equally spectacular. The multi-faceted performance from the versatile junior etched his name into some conversations for the Heisman Trophy and — if he chooses to turn pro following the season — ensured that he left the Coliseum with a bang in his potential final home game.
“We have this creature here to the right of me, doing a kick return, punt return and a catch for a touchdown,” head coach Clay Helton said. “He just looked like something … he’s a superhero figure. I don’t even know.”
Even in games where he doesn’t have a flashy moment, Jackson arguably still works harder than any other player on the field. Primarily a cornerback and the team’s most athletic defensive player, he is usually matched up against the opponent’s best wide receiver. He returns all punts and kicks, making him an integral part of the special teams’ unit. And he occasionally appears on offense, either as a decoy or for a specially designed play meant to gain big yardage.
“I think he’s the best overall football player in the country,” redshirt junior defensive back Chris Hawkins said.
Redshirt sophomore defensive back Ajene Harris, who returned an interception for a touchdown in the win, echoed that sentiment.
“Everything he does is just like a ‘wow’ to everybody,” Harris said. “I don’t know if there’s something he can’t do, to be honest with you.”
It would be hard-pressed to find another player who excels at so many parts of the game as Jackson, and his versatility was on full display on Saturday. His 52-yard scamper down the left sideline in the third quarter on a screen pass blew the game open, but it was his 97-yard kick return for a touchdown later in the quarter that officially turned a sloppy afternoon into “The Adoree’ Game.”
“I felt bad for the people blocking on that play,” Hawkins said, “because they don’t really get to see what he did in real time.”
It probably took watching a replay for everyone else to fully appreciate the return as well. Taking the kickoff from inside his own 5-yard line, Jackson broke a couple of tackles, sped upfield and leapt over Notre Dame placekicker John Chereson before running into the end zone.
Jackson called the leap “instinct.”
“I did it in high school before,” he said. “I know kickers always hit low and try to get you out to the sideline. As soon as he came to me, I was just timing it up and I was able to hurdle him.”
Too tired to land a front flip after scoring, Jackson said he settled on mimicking the Heisman pose. That probably worked out for the best, because Jackson may have an outside chance at claiming college football’s most prestigious award. Though Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson remains the clear favorite, Jackson might earn a trip to New York for the ceremony, and he can thank his outburst on Saturday for the invite.
“He’s the best player I know in the whole country,” junior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu said.  “Best player, hands down. You witnessed it right there. No player has ever hurdled over a guy and scored — that I know of.”
Nwosu was quickly reminded of the last USC player to leap over a defender and score: Reggie Bush, who hurdled UCLA’s Marcus Cassel in the regular season finale in 2005 to help send the then-No. 1 Trojans to the national championship. Though he eventually forfeited the trophy, Bush went on to win the Heisman that year.
“Turn the 2 upside down and it’s a 5 Now,” Jackson tweeted after the game, referring to jersey numbers and placing side-by-side images of the two leaps.
“Young Bull,” Bush responded, with a bull emoji.
 Jackson might not win the Heisman, but he has won over a fair share of hearts at USC. Through three tumultuous seasons, Jackson has been a stalwart on defense and a game-changer both on offense and special teams. And if Saturday was his last USC game at the Coliseum, he could not have scripted his day any better.
As the game finished up and a majority of players departed for the locker room, Jackson ran toward the USC student section and climbed onto a ladder in front of the marching band to lead “Conquest.” He jubilantly stabbed the sword in the air, and when it was over, turned to the crowd, which responded with chants of, “One more year! One more year!”
Upon hearing it, Jackson paused and nodded his head before rocking back and forth and doing a mini-dance to the chant’s rhythm. Then, he climbed down and headed for the tunnel, unsure of if this would be the final time he would make that trek in a USC jersey.
Jackson did admit the chants made it harder for him to leave.
“It’s one of those feelings you can’t describe,” he said. “The crowd was loud. This game was the most fun game I’ve ever been a part of. Just hearing them scream and everything throughout the game, it was a feeling that was unbelievable.”
But will the “feeling” be worth another season at USC? Only time will tell.

Dialing it up from 3-point range was the mantra for the men’s basketball team this past weekend, as it defeated both SMU and UC Santa Barbara in a pair of games at the Galen Center. 
With a hard fought 78-73 win over SMU on Friday night and a 96-72 victory against visiting UC Santa Barbara (0-5) Sunday, the Trojans improved to 6-0 on the season — the best start for the team since the 2000-2001 season, when the team started 8-0.
In both its victories, USC shot a combined 26-of-59 (44 percent) from behind the 3-point line. In Sunday’s victory, the Trojan offense was dominated by shooting three-point field goals — 35 of USC’s 61 shots attempted against UC Santa Barbara came from beyond the 3-point line. 
“We were just playing with the flow of the game. If we’re knocking down three’s, we’re going to keep shooting them,” said junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who was 3-for-3 from 3-point range against UC Santa Barbara Sunday. “[UC Santa Barbara] was playing a lot of zone defense tonight, and we were able to hit our shots; we just try to play fast and unselfish basketball.”
Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright shot 9-of-18 from beyond the arc over the two games this weekend. In both Friday and Sunday’s games, Boatwright was the leading scorer for USC, recording game-highs in scoring against SMU and UC Santa Barbara with 17 and 21 points, respectively. 
“He was much more fluid tonight. He was quicker with his decision-making. He shot the ball well,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He’s getting back to where he needs to be.” 
In Sunday’s victory against the Gauchos, sophomore forward Chimezie Metu filled the stat sheet, recording 15 points, five rebounds, three blocks and three assists. Metu — who struggled as a free throw shooter in his freshman season, but has shown consistent improvement as a sophomore — went 7-of-8 from the foul line against UC Santa Barbara Sunday. 
As has become routine early on this season, USC’s freshmen performed well throughout the weekend. 
On Friday against SMU, freshman guard De’Anthony Melton scored a career-high 15 points, reeled in a team-high six rebounds and recorded five assists. 
Melton followed that performance up on Sunday against Santa Barbara by scoring six points, recording five assists and grabbing three rebounds. Melton also had four steals on Sunday — he currently leads the Pac-12 in steals with 18 so far this season.
“Anytime you can generate steals or blocked shots it can lead to good opportunities in transition,” Enfield said. “When [Melton] is able to create those opportunities, you see our offense flowing at a much more efficient rate.” 
Freshman guard Jonah Mathews also recorded a career-high 14 points on 3-of-4 shooting from the field against SMU; he went 7-of-10 from the free throw line. 
On Sunday, freshman forward Niko Rakocevic scored 6 of his 8 points late in the second half, as the Trojans widened their lead on Santa Barbara. Rakocevic pulled in four rebounds Sunday and recorded a blocked shot. 
Scoring surges in the second half were essential for the Trojans in both of their victories this weekend. 
After ending the first half against SMU with a slim 28-27 lead, USC went on an 11-0 second half run that eventually led it to victory. Against UC Santa Barbara, USC outscored the Guachos 53-34 in the second half to put the contest out of reach. 
As it built its lead in the second half against Santa Barbara, USC outrebounded the Gauchos by a margin of 21-12 to close out the game.
Sunday’s game against UC Santa Barbara closed out a three-game home stand for the Trojans, who will now hit the road to take on the University of San Diego at Jenny Craig Pavilion on Wednesday.

College football is obsessed with records. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it isn’t a good one either. At times, it can cloud someone’s vision and allow one to overlook the talent and current play of a team just because of its record. Other times, focusing on records completely makes sense. 
I know what you’re thinking; she’s probably talking about USC. I am, but Penn State also falls into the same discussion. After beating Michigan this past Saturday, it seems like Ohio State is a lock for the playoff. Last week, both the AP and the College Football Playoff rankings mirrored each other. This week, the AP has Ohio State sitting at No. 2, so one could reasonably guess that the Buckeyes will hold that spot for the CFP.
So that looks good for the Big Ten, right? Wrong. The Big Ten is in an interesting situation. The Buckeyes are sitting at No. 2 in the nation with an 11-1 overall record, so that means they’re playing in the conference championship, right? Wrong, again. 
Facing off for the conference title for the Big Ten will be Penn State and Wisconsin. Both teams are sitting at 10-2, and Penn State has a bit of an advantage with its win over Ohio State thanks to a blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown toward the end of the fourth quarter. The CFP Committee always talks about how they like conference champions, but with Ohio State as the likely candidate for the second spot in the playoff, that goes against what they typically like. If Penn State ends up beating Wisconsin, they will have a viable shot at the playoff, because Ohio State’s only loss was at the hand of the Nittany Lions. It’s a mess, and the committee could have one heck of a headache going into the release of its rankings on Sunday. While a 11-2 conference champion looks great and is more or less a dream team for the committee based on rankings alone, it isn’t really better than an 11-1 team with quality wins throughout the season. 
What makes this whole Big Ten debacle even more interesting is that the first protocol — according to the CFP committee selection protocol — is winning a conference championship. The other three are strength of schedule, head-to-head competition (if possible) and outcomes of common opponents (without considering margin of victory). Looking at the committee’s protocol from their standpoint, a Wisconsin win will make their lives easier. 
Now, what about USC? Its chances of making the playoff are virtually impossible. Just imagine how many people would freak out if a three-loss team made it to the playoff. While the Trojans won’t see themselves playing in one of the semifinals, they could still see themselves playing at the Rose Bowl, somewhere they haven’t played since 2009. USC has played in the most Rose Bowls (33) and has won the most Rose Bowls (24) of any college program. With the Trojans back in the national discussion and a number of analysts, such as Kirk Herbstreit, saying that USC is the one team that no one wants to play right now, other than Alabama. He also made the argument that if the CFP is looking for the best teams that USC should be higher. Vegas even has the Trojans as the No. 3 team in the country. 
The Trojans’ success makes the case that the playoff should be expanded. An expansion would allow for teams like USC that started their season rough but have completely flipped the script to close out the year. The Trojans that upset No. 4 Washington 26-13 and have handily outscored their rivals 81-41 are nowhere near the team that started its season 1-3 with losses to Alabama, Stanford and Utah. If the committee wants the best teams playing for a championship, a team like USC fits the bill. Through their eight-game win streak, the Trojans have beaten everyone except Colorado by double digits. 
A surging USC team following a shaky start brings back memories of Pete Carroll’s 2002 Trojans. That season, USC started out 3-2, but finished 11-2 on the back of senior quarterback Carson Palmer. Palmer performed so well that he caught national attention and won the Heisman Trophy, USC’s first quarterback to do so. The Trojans finished No. 5 in the BCS and beat No. 3 Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 38-17. There are a number of similarities between the 2002 season and this season, such as dominating victories over UCLA and Notre Dame and a quarterback garnering national attention. 
If the similarities continue, the Trojans could see themselves in the Rose Bowl instead of the Orange Bowl. On top of it, USC would set a foundation for national championships for years to come, cementing it as a national powerhouse once again.
