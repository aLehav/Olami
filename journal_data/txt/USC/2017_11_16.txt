At USC, non-U.S. citizens don’t qualify for financial aid. 
Xiaoyue Zhang, assistant director of the International Student Assembly, is concerned that this reality might stunt economic diversity at the University — peculiarly, all while boosting its racial diversity. 
It’s a concern that seems to undress the prevalent notion that diversity on college campuses is a monolithic goal, that racial diversity neatly equates to economic diversity and vice versa. Policy at USC around financial resources for non-U.S. citizens poses new questions about the intersectionality of diversity, and how to measure USC’s progress in opening up its campus to as many different students as possible.
Racially, but not economically diverse?
Zhang thinks that though the  population of international students at USC has positively contributed to racial diversity at USC, it has also helped the University retain its reputation for economic privilege and elitism.
“While USC talks about its diversity, a lot of people just say it’s a university of spoiled children,” Zhang said. “In terms of country representation or the amount of international students on campus, I would say USC is diverse. But if you separate it in terms of lower income and high income, medium income, it’s not diverse at all for international students.”
And yet, the U.S. News and World Report’s 2018 rankings released in September offered another perspective. The report ranked USC fourth in economic diversity among national universities, which measured economic diversity in terms of the percentage of undergraduate students receiving Pell grants.
USC’s fourth-place ranking in economic diversity is comparable to its eighth place in ethnic diversity alongside UC Berkeley, which ranks second in economic diversity, and Harvard University, which ranks fifth in economic diversity. USC’s racial and ethnic breakdowns were also an acknowledged factor in The Wall Street Journal’s 2016 decision to rank USC as the 15th best college in the nation. 
These numbers paint a bright picture of inclusivity at the University — but this may be an incomplete one.
The effect of financial aid
A plurality of USC’s student body attends the University with the help of federal and university financial aid. 
Statistics from the 2015-2016 academic year show that 59 percent of all undergraduate students received an average of $35,059 in financial aid. Half of USC’s undergraduate student body applied for financial aid, and of the University’s 2,948 full-time freshman students enrolled in Fall 2015, 1,880 — more than half — received federal work-study, grants, loans and scholarships. 
USC offered grants, loans and scholarships to 1,776 members of the Fall 2015 freshman class. The University’s Fall 2017 freshman class consists of 17 percent first-generation students; this statistic falls just below Stanford’s 18 percent and UCLA’s 21 percent. 
But not everyone is included in these numbers.
According to the University’s financial aid website, international students are not given need-based financial aid. Instead, international students are only eligible for merit-based scholarships and can apply for on-campus or off-campus jobs (not work-study). 
USC’s policy is different from those of other American universities like the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Amherst College, Yale University and Harvard University, which offer financial aid packages as needed to any students who are admitted.
According to numbers reported by Harvard University, its international student body receives as much financial aid as its domestic student body. Amherst College does not offer merit-based scholarships and operates solely through a need-based system which applies to its international student body as well. 
Kirk Brennan, director of undergraduate admissions, said that admissions for international students at USC cannot be completely need-blind, as federal policy requires international applicants to apply for F1 student visas. This process requires proof that these applicants can afford to attend university for a year in the United States with their own income or with scholarships and aid from the university they will attend. Brennan said that  in turn, USC must consider whether or not international applicants can obtain the visa, or what their financial needs are to obtain the visa and attend the University. 
“They will often mention in the application, ‘Hey, I’ve got $40,000, I need, $20,000, or $30,000 more in assistance,’” Brennan said. “So, sometimes they’ll get that number in the form of a scholarship, and if they don’t, then it is difficult to still offer admission to a student if we know they can’t even get a visa to attend here.”
But Brennan said that international applicants who have not demonstrated financial ability to attend USC may still be admitted. 
“Sometimes we want to simply make them that offer, and hope that they can somehow make up the difference,” Brennan said. “Sometimes we feel that they should know we really want them, but know that we may not be able to enroll them given that environment.” 
Other universities are able to offer more comprehensive financial aid packages to international applicants and instate need-blind admissions practices for them, Brennan conceded. But USC does not have the same resources as these institutions, he said, and part of this is because of the economically diverse backgrounds of the students that USC admits.
“Other schools have resources to provide need-based financial aid to more students than we do,” Brennan said. “I think we have very sound, fair financial aid policies at USC, but some schools have more wealth per student, and they’re able to share that more broadly with incoming students, and can consider international students in that way.”
Ultimately, Brennan said that in its international recruitment process, USC clearly publicizes options for merit scholarships, on- and off-campus work and other resources available to international students with financial need.
And yet, Zhang remains skeptical. She acknowledged the resources that are available to students on paper, but is adamant that in practice, these resources just aren’t enough. To Zhang, it’s simple: The University is hurting itself by maintaining a non-inclusive financial aid system that may prohibit qualified international students from attending.
“The tuition prevents some better, more qualified students who can’t afford it from coming here,” Zhang said. 
A close connection
To Tim Brunold, dean of undergraduate admissions at USC, accessibility to higher education is an intersectional issue. 
“In the United States, wealth inequality continues to increase, largely along racial lines, and as such, we know that expanding educational access and improving racial and ethnic diversity tends to result in increased economic diversity, and vice versa,” Brunold said.
Kameron Hurt, a pre-college admissions specialist at USC’s Center for Black Culture and Student Affairs, spoke of diversity on college campuses as a microcosm of broader national political dialogues — namely, concerns that the discussion around race, gender and “identity politics” hurts low-income white communities. 
While Hurt acknowledged that universities like USC should work on opening its doors to low-income white families, he questioned how discussion of racial diversity could even be separated from discussion of economic diversity at all.
“We should work on expanding poor, white access to this school, but at the same time we have to understand that however hard we work on that, we have to work really, really hard on boosting the numbers of poor minorities,” Hurt said. 
Yet, Hurt said that racial diversity complements economic diversity generally.
“I think they should really go hand-in-hand, because as you increase that economic diversity, you’re going to look back and notice that you’re recruiting more and more people of color,” Hurt said. “As you increase the economic diversity, there will be a correlation with racial diversity.”
Jonathan Wang, director of USC’s Asian Pacific American Student Services, is skeptical of the potential consequences of suggesting that students of color are monolithic, and all come from low-income backgrounds. According to Wang, USC and other universities are populated with students who are middle-class or wealthy, but still have unique needs on the basis of their racial identity that must also be met.
“We have students who are both well-off and students of color,” Wang said. “But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t serve them in the same way we serve students who are not students of color and who are of low socioeconomic status.”
To Wang, this could be summed up in two questions. 
“When we just focus on students of color who are low-income, does that mean we negate students of color who are not low-income? Does that negate students who are low-income but not students of color?”

An overlooked group
According to Wang, students of color come from diverse economic backgrounds. Students of color who are not low-income and low-income white students exist at the University, advocates argue, and both have significant needs.
But undocumented students constitute a unique group in the discussion on the relationship between racial and economic diversity. Many are students of color, and many shoulder the economic barriers that come with lack of citizenship. 
Undocumented students are ineligible to receive federal financial aid, and according to the College Board, in most states, they are also ineligible to receive state financial aid. Every year, 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high school, according to the most recent data from the advocacy group Educators for Fair Consideration, but only 10,000 of them graduate from college.
On top of the financial barriers posed from lack of financial aid and scholarships that only consider U.S. citizens, legal barriers such as the threat of deportation also threaten this community’s access to higher education. 
According to Sonia Chavez-Meza, director of cultural affairs of the Latinx Student Assembly and a student worker at El Centro Chicano, these policies are not the only barrier for undocumented students seeking higher education. 
The stigma surrounding undocumented people in U.S. colleges prevents circulation of crucial information about available resources, such as merit-based scholarships from private organizations. Chavez-Meza said that even El Centro Chicano, which was created to offer Latinx students resources, doesn’t have experts specifically to help undocumented students procure financial aid. Instead, she thinks undocumented students are often left to fend for themselves.
“A lot of the resources are really scattered and put together by other students from their hard work and real effort, rather than the University,” Chavez-Meza said. “I don’t know what sort of aid they give. I know for a lot of colleges the requirements are high GPA, and being a U.S. citizen, so if you’re undocumented you couldn’t really apply for a lot of scholarships.”
Some advocates have a solution
“I don’t know what sort of aid USC gives to undocumented students,” Chavez-Meza said. “I know for a lot of colleges the requirements are high GPA, and being a U.S. citizen, so if you’re undocumented you couldn’t really apply for a lot of scholarships.”
Chavez-Meza thinks that a lack of awareness about what is available to undocumented students may be a problem in itself, like legal and financial barriers to access. But unlike those, this problem has a clear solution. 
To her, that means opening up an undocumented student resource center at USC or, at the very least, publishing visible, accessible informational pages on the University’s website specifically dedicated to financial and legal resources for undocumented students. 
Until USC formally establishes one, she is concerned that economic barriers on the basis of students’ race and nationality will continue to stint campus diversity.
On his website, USC Provost Michael Quick lists contact information for offices that students with financial need or situations affected by changes in state and federal policy can reach out to. Some of these offices include the Gould Law Immigration Clinic, the Financial Aid Office and Office of Religious Life. Vanessa Gomez Brake, associate dean of religious life at USC, believes these different resources are enough to meet student needs.
“While we do not have a resource center for undocumented students, USC has taken a strong stand in support of all students and staff members, regardless of immigration status or their nation of origin,” Brake said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “As the point person for immigrant and international students, I support students one-on-one in navigating our campuses many resources.”
Resources on campus
Kameron Hurt of CBCSA said he believes “welcoming diversity” is more than accepting certain numbers of poor or minority students — it’s ensuring they have the resources to graduate and have a positive academic experience throughout their years at USC. 
“Saying that the school appreciates and welcomes diversity is one thing,” Hurt said. “But then, if you’re not able to meet the needs of that diversity, of those people beyond just letting them into the school, then allowing them to continue and flourish at the school would be actually welcoming diversity.”
He hopes to see more interaction between administration and the different, student-run cultural assemblies that host events catered to their respective groups. On top of this, Hurt believes the University must widen access to not only financial aid and scholarships, but also everyday living necessities such as textbooks and food in Los Angeles, a city that Business Insider ranked the second most expensive in the country in 2016.
Hurt believes that diversity requires resources, focus and attention to be upheld. But Brunold views diversity as a crucial resource to the student body in itself.
“A heterogeneous academic environment provides improved opportunities for meaningful discourse, expanded learning and creative problem solving,” Brunold said. “Diversity is absolutely critical.”
Jonathan Wang of APASS agreed that diverse college campuses not only have more to offer, but also prepare students for the challenges and experiences of real life in ways that campuses lacking in diversity simply can’t.
“I think campus would be very boring if everyone were the same, if we only took one type of student from one background,” Wang said. “It would be just a very homogenous campus that wouldn’t challenge us to meet the demands and needs of our society.”
When Hurt visits local, predominantly black and Latinx schools around USC to engage with students and help them see themselves at USC, he finds himself thinking about the future. 
To Hurt, USC has more power than it realizes in expanding racial and economic diversity and empowering low-income and minority individuals not only on its campus, but also in society at large. But according to him, the University must either actively choose to be a part of this large-scale reform, or continue to maintain an existing status quo of inequality.
“We know that getting a degree from USC has a high correlation with economic success afterward, a higher chance of getting recruited by a job, connections,” Hurt said. “If we continue to only extend those connections to the families that already have connections and are already wealthy, then we’re just going to perpetuate the same cycles instead of helping to actually uplift those in need.”

Students, staff and faculty gathered in front of Tommy Trojan, holding posters bearing slogans that decried racism, bigotry and xenophobia. Impassioned speeches were met with raucous applause. The crowd sang and chanted together in a show of solidarity with marginalized communities, a rallying cry that echoed not only at USC, but also across college campuses nationwide. 
In the midst of a contentious political climate, protests and demonstrations organized by college students have been cropping up more than ever. With the recent violence that erupted at UC Berkeley over the invitation of alt-right speakers, student activism has been thrust into the national spotlight, and plenty of media attention has been focused on the question: To what extent should students be allowed to exercise their political freedoms on campus? 
USC, however, does not seem to possess a robust culture of student activism comparable to that of other college campuses across the nation. Although student activism does exist at USC, it occurs only in small pockets, and it has not flourished with nearly the same scale and intensity as other campuses such as UC Berkeley. 
Amanda Chan, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and economics, is involved with USC Students for Justice in Palestine and Young Democratic Socialists of America. She attributed the disparity partly to the difference between public and private universities, where private schools are held less accountable for their practices and are allowed a greater degree of carte blanche. 
“USC tries to be apolitical; that’s how the culture is,” Chan said. “Because we’re a private school, students tend to be more conservative. It’s more focused on career goals and building your brand.” 
Rini Sampath, a USC alumna and former student body president, believes that there is no incentive for USC to actively work toward change if there is no external pressure. In 2015, Sampath found herself surrounded by a media maelstrom when another USC student hurled a racial epithet at her. Instead of staying quiet about her experience, however, she chose to speak out, garnering national attention and leading to a widespread demand for change by the student body.  
“There’s a problem at USC where the pressure is put on through negative media attention and that typically is what leads to lasting change,” Sampath said. “If there isn’t any, there is no initiative taken to remedy the problems. Or, there are situations where there is negative media attention, yet steps to address the issue still aren’t taken.” 
Sampath said the USC administration prioritizes fundraising and financial gain over community improvements and therefore remains complacent about students’ concerns.
“At the end of the day, nothing will seriously change because it’s not hurting the institution where it matters, which is the the administrators,” Sampath said. “As long as administrators bring in billions of dollars, it’s difficult to really push them to create change because it’s not affecting them.”
In a statement, Monique Allard, the associate vice provost for student engagement, reaffirmed USC’s commitment to supporting students’ advocacy efforts and creating a culture of mutual respect. 
“USC is committed to fostering a learning environment where free inquiry and expression are encouraged and celebrated, and for which all its members share responsibility,” Allard wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Student Affairs wholeheartedly supports student voice and student advocacy.” 
But student activists looking to hold a protest must follow a series of steps, which student activists believe USC makes deliberately confusing and complex.
David Delgado, a senior majoring in gender studies and theatre, is involved with SCALE, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
“Most organization is in a public place because you want to show people what you’re doing, like a rally,” Delgado said. “And in USC’s policies, if you want to do that, you need to reserve that space nearly a month in advance, which isn’t a sustainable model. You have to rent out the facility, you have to fill out the paperwork, you have to have a student adviser on the premises, you have to pay for amplified sound.”  
 According to the USC student handbook, SCampus, students must reserve the venue where they wish to hold a protest through Trojan Event Services, which issues permits at its own discretion.
Students also need to complete an Outdoor Event Questionnaire and a USC Event Permit Application at least two weeks in advance and schedule a meeting with the director of campus activities. Any flyers and posters also have to be approved beforehand.

Lynn Wang, a senior majoring in environmental studies, also believes that the lack of transparency from the administration and its refusal to acknowledge campus issues discourages students from voicing their discontent. 
“USC has very restrictive policies on what student activists can and cannot do, which severely hinders our actions,” Wang said. “They’re also very quick to shut down actions that don’t fit into what is allowed. They have very, very tight regulations, so it takes an absurd amount of planning to pull something off.” 
After attempting to speak with the administration about their concerns and being denied an audience, student activists said that they felt that their efforts were futile and that their voices are being ignored. Delgado agreed that USC’s administration has been vague and obscure when dealing with the demands of student protesters, sometimes even retracting their promises.  Open forums were held with Provost Michael Quick and Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, but according to Delgado, they did not provide direct answers or solutions, and he felt that attention soon tapered off. 
“As soon as the pressure died down, those meetings stopped happening,” Delgado said. “If the University was actually interested in hearing student voices, they would make changes without having hundreds of students knocking at their doors.” 
In order for USC to improve in dealing with student activists and assist in promoting a more welcoming environment for advocacy, Wang believes that the most basic effort that the University can put forth is to keep its word. 
“It would be nice if they committed to the things they promised to us rather than reneging,” Wang said. “We in the activist community have agreed that USC is so focused on its image that the only way to bring accountability is to name and shame.” 
Allard encouraged students interested in making a difference on campus to get involved with student government and the local community. 
“In regards to helping students make change, I again encourage interested students to work with their respective student governments to express their interests, and join the student government advocacy efforts,” Allard wrote. 
The phrase “champagne socialism” comes to mind.

6:00 a.m. weight training sessions. 8:30 a.m. class. 12:00 p.m. lunch. 2:30 p.m. watching film. 3:30 p.m. practice.
This schedule sounds standard for an NCAA student-athlete, but what about for a high schooler? 
Elite athletic departments like USC are utilizing intense high school athletics to find top recruits around the country. 
For redshirt junior baseball player Angelo Armenta, the college-like atmosphere of his high school propelled him to the Division I level.
“I think it was good because we did a lot of morning lifts, it wasn’t really like high school, it was more like college-based practices and stuff,” Armenta said. “We would lift in the morning, we would practice for a couple hours and everything was really organized and the coaches were pretty on top of their stuff.”
Along with the advanced training of athletes, the connections that high schools develop with universities can impact where athletes play at the next level. Connections are nothing new for the Trojan Family, and athletics are no different. For sophomore linebacker Oluwole Betiku, who grew up in Nigeria, the connections brought him to USC. Betiku is one of nine current football players who attended Junipero Serra High School, also known as Gardena Serra, in Gardena, Calif.
 “Man, it’s like a lot of players from there go to USC and the players who go to USC make it to the NFL and they get a good education, too,” Betiku said. “You just hear good stories about the program, so being at Serra and seeing those guys come back all the time and hearing their stories just makes you want to be a Trojan also.”
High schools are putting more money into their facilities, resources toward preparing their students in the classroom and hours into training them on the field, but producing successful athletes on a large scale requires one thing — money.
USC recruits athletes globally, but has established pipeline schools within the area. The three high schools with the most athletes at USC currently are all private, extending the University’s exclusivity. 
The USC Athletic Department declined to comment for this story.
Establishing a pipeline
For USC, California is the big-picture pipeline. Nearly 70 percent of domestic student-athletes hail from the Golden State, compared with only 42 percent of the admitted freshman class of 2017.
 Armenta and Betiku come from Loyola High School and Gardena Serra High School, respectively. Loyola and Gardena Serra are the second- and third-most represented high schools among athletes, with Loyola producing 10 and Gardena Serra nine. The only high school with more athletes at USC is Mater Dei High School, in Santa Ana, Calif., which has 19. 
USC isn’t targeting these schools because they are private, but because they produce nationally acclaimed athletes. The schools have the resources to produce these athletes because of their money.

“Private schools, not that they have limitless resources, but we don’t have to worry about getting a bus for the team or other things that a lot of public schools have to scrape by with,” said Chris O’Donnell, athletic director at Loyola High School. “A lot of private schools don’t struggle for the basics. We may have to decide what to concentrate our resources on, but it’s not the basics.”
Founded in 1865 — 15 years before USC — Loyola is the oldest high school in Los Angeles. The Jesuit, all-boys school boasts on its website that 100 percent of its graduates pursue higher education. Similar to the lifelong loyalty that Trojan alumni show, at Loyola, there is a tradition of legacy.
 “I was pretty much going to go there no matter what unless I didn’t get in,” Armenta said. “My dad went there too. So that was basically why I was going to go there. There’s a lot of grandparents and dads that go there.”
 O’Donnell said such stories  aren’t unusual, adding that alumni have called him and said they plan to move back to Los Angeles from the East Coast so that their sons can attend the school.
An advantage private schools have is  that they can pull students from all over without worrying about the boundaries of a school district. Loyola serves over 200 ZIP codes, according to its website.
“Mira Costa [High School] only gets students from a small area,” O’Donnell said. “We get students from a large area of ZIP codes so we can get the best of the best. If we were a local school, we would be limited to the people who lived around us.”
Advantages on and off the field
While the top three schools are all private, they are followed by Mira Costa,  in Manhattan Beach, Calif. There are currently eight student-athletes at USC  from Mira Costa.
Although it is a public school, the affluent community that Mira Costa serves has allowed it to provide services and facilities reminiscent of a private academy. The school recently passed a $39 million bond that will create a new facility for gymnasium sports and training facilities, in addition to a $6 million synthetic turf field.
“When the community is putting $39 million into the gym and $6 million into the field, the argument is that we have to do our job with the athletes as well,” said Glenn Marx, the athletic director at Mira Costa. “The reason is, you are competing with the private schools in affluent areas. People who move into our community are affluent and we want them to feel that they can stay local and get a good education at our public school.”
In addition to the athletic facilities, student-athletes have more resources on the academic side to help them get to college. At Mira Costa, Marx and vice principal Stephanie Hall head up a College Recruiting Advisory Program. The program focuses on making sure that the athletes are meeting all of their core class requirements to qualify for college on top of advising them on some of the trickier aspects of the recruiting process, such as visiting campuses and managing offers.
This contributes to the success of student-athletes coming out of Mira Costa, but Marx also says it has a lot to do with the community and family life.
“Because of the affluent community, there is a desire for kids to go to college and keep up their grades and go to a school like USC,” Marx said. “It’s a combination of the affluent community — kids are more likely to take AP classes and get tutors — and the facilities, which enhance performance along with the influence of the club circuit.”
At a private school,  those things are taken for granted. For Loyola, athletics isn’t the main focus, though it comes along with having wealthy and talented students from across Los Angeles.
“Having scholarship athletes is not the main course of the meal, but it is a spice that makes the meal taste that much better,” O’Donnell said. “Not that we don’t want our athletes recruited — it just isn’t the end-all-be-all. We want them to get better and get into college. If they can get into a college that they want to because of their athletics, that’s what we want. And if they get money on top of that, it’s even better.”
Loyola has 11 counselors who help guide students through the college application process.
“We put a lot of effort into our kids going to college and where they are going to college,” O’Donnell said.
The resources that private schools can put into their students don’t stop in the classroom. Armenta said he  played on teams outside of school that were organized by his high school coaches.
“Our coaches had connections so they would hook us up with travel teams, club teams, so we would get extra work on the weekend,” Armenta said. “We’d face different players who were going to go to the next level on the weekends, so it was good to prepare us for college.”
Administrators said that generally those who can afford  a private school can afford club teams and private coaching. It speaks to the advantage that athletes from wealthy backgrounds have in their early playing days.
“If they can afford $20,000 tuition, they can probably afford private hitting coaches, trainers and afford travel ball,” O’Donnell said.
This all contributes to the likelihood that these athletes will have the opportunity to go on to play in college. Not only is there advanced training, but there are also extra opportunities to earn a scholarship.
“We had a club team run by a different coach,” Armenta said. “We went to Arizona for the Junior Olympics. We played there to get looked at by college coaches. We’d have practices with college coaches there so they could see us. Just more exposure, basically.”
All in the family
For many high school athletes, playing at the collegiate level is on their mind from the time they get their varsity letters. However, for Betiku, the dream of playing football for USC came from an entirely different place.
“Honestly, just looking at a program, an education and what the school had to offer besides football, I just felt like USC was the best place for me to develop as a person, as a man,” Betiku said. “Coming from Nigeria, going to a good school like this was just a dream, something that I never saw happening.”
Betiku didn’t step onto a football field until his sophomore year of high school. Under the guidance of former NFL player and guardian LaVar Arrington, however, Betiku received top-notch coaching both at home and at school. The draw to USC made sense for him and he was exposed to it early and often in his playing career. Throngs of Serra players have gone on to become Trojans, such as Deontay Burnett, Rasheem Green and John Houston Jr., whom Betiku played with in high school.
“My senior year I would always come here to hang out with them every other weekend,” Betiku said. “I already had a feel for the team and the guys who are around.”
The sentiment was the same for Armenta, who was able to connect with former teammates who went on to play at USC, such as former Trojan Corey Dempster.
“He told me what to expect and I was prepared more because of that,” Armenta said.
These connections can be invaluable for creating lasting relationships between USC and the high schools it recruits from.

Despite pulling athletes from 38 states, USC has 340 student-athletes from California. Five of the top-10 represented high schools are private. The advantages of attending a private high school are significant, but attending a public school in a wealthy neighborhood adds up to a lot of the same resources. Armenta says there is a clear advantage in going to a private school, if you use of all the extra resources that are available.
“It helps a lot being from a private school,” Armenta said. “You have more resources, but once you get here [USC], it’s just the same.”
Money and power follow Cardinal and Gold in the classroom and on the field. Athletes come from everywhere and USC finds top-notch talent regardless of what neighborhood a kid grew up in. 
However, as far as patterns over time are concerned, affluency leads to success, and it starts well before anyone steps on campus.

Ashley Chen, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, submitted her college applications in Fall 2016 alongside hundreds of thousands of other students. But as she filled out her Free Application for Federal Student Aid, she realized it would reflect her family’s financial standing inaccurately. Chen’s father had lost his job, but her application could not reflect this change until the following year. 
Thomas McWhorter, USC’s dean of financial aid, said the University takes special circumstances like Chen’s into account. But when she petitioned the financial aid office, she said she was awarded more unsubsidized loans, increasing the debts she would accumulate upon graduation. Chen is a recipient of the Presidential Scholarship, a half-tuition merit scholarship, but said her family is still stretched financially by having to pay for her tuition.  
“Savings aren’t going to last forever,” Chen said. “I’m just really worried about what’s gonna happen next year. I know tuition is only going to hike and even though the merit scholarship will continue to be 50 percent every year, it’s still growing.”

As USC works to provide aid and scholarships for low-income students, those in the middle of the socioeconomic spectrum are suffering. Chen said she was frustrated with the University’s financial aid office and became even more upset when she saw the events it was hosting, particularly USC Village’s donor gala. 
“When they had the evening gala in the Village … I just could not believe how much money they spent just on the light show,” Chen said. “And I understand it’s for the donors, the donors must have donated many, many times more than that, but the money that they are donating is for the students … not for USC to set up extravagant events for them.”
At the same time, McWhorter said the University meets 100 percent of demonstrated need with a generous $330 million in financial aid. He said the financial aid office wants to help, and encourages students to come in and talk to them if they feel their need isn’t being met. 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 64 percent of full-time beginning undergraduate students at USC received some form of financial aid in the 2015-16 academic year, either through scholarships or federal grants. 
For upper-middle income ($75,000 to $100,000) students who do qualify for federal need-based financial aid, USC’s estimated net price for the 2016-17 year is $28,010, a decrease of 13.8 percent over the last four years. 
The University even boasts lower average student debt after college than the national average. 2016 graduates left with $22,375 in average debt, according to the U.S. Department of Education, while, nationally, college graduates had an average of $37,172 in student debt, according to The Wall Street Journal.

But students like Chen — who don’t qualify for any need-based aid — can still fall through cracks in the system, where what’s considered demonstrated need might not match a family’s realistic need. 
“They call it the middle-class squeeze, so basically, some of the students won’t be qualifying for the federal Pell grant won’t be qualifying for the state grants, so that means that their families are [paying] a larger share,” said Tatiana Melguizo, an associate professor at the Rossier School of Education who specializes in the economics of higher education. 
One such student is Lauren Oberreiter, a freshman majoring in international relations and global business. Although Oberreiter received approximately $15,000 in merit aid from the University, she didn’t receive any need-based financial aid, and even with her family’s contribution, she estimates that she will graduate with about $80,000 in student debt. 
“My parents have saved up about $125,000 for me,” Oberreiter said. “Anything past that is past what they can realistically afford with mortgages, other things [and] they have to save for their retirement.”

Another such student is senior Karlee Hormell majoring in music industry. Hormell’s parents had to mortgage their home for her to attend USC since she was not awarded any financial aid. 
“It puts a lot of strain on my family’s financial situation,” Hormell said. “[Mortgaging the house] was not something that was planned for me to go to school. If I were to attend another university that costs a lot less, we would never have had to do that, so that was specific to USC and not receiving financial aid.”
Hormell submitted a FAFSA application her freshman year, and despite her family living on a single salary, she was not granted any aid. 
“There’s a lot more to a story than what you see on paper. And I think that’s what gets lost in the FAFSA system,” Hormell said. “By putting dollar amounts on students, on people, and what that looks like in reality, I would just say there is more to the story than what they require.” 
Melguizo says there are ways that private institutions like USC can better aid students like Oberreiter, Chen and Hormell. 
“One thing that universities like USC have is that they have the freedom to ask for more financial information, so they can get a much better sense of the financial reality of a family,” Melguizo said. “This student will be really penalized in UCLA, that has to go through the federal mandate, but I think USC has the resources to really study the characteristics of the family.” 
But it’s unclear if that is actually happening. When Oberreiter went to USC’s financial aid office, she said they told her that on paper, she was a millionaire without even knowing it. Because of her family’s assets and savings, her family’s expected contribution for college was $91,000 a year, according to FAFSA calculations.

“[They] said, we get that your family isn’t millionaires, you don’t have access to all that money, but because of the way that it reads, we just can’t offer you any assistance in that way,” Oberreiter explained. 
McWhorter said the financial aid office considers these assets to ensure an equitable distribution of funding. Some factors USC uses that aren’t considered under federal methodology include home and business equity and tax adjustments that reduce a family’s reported income.
“As an example, some families may choose to place family savings in investment accounts or college saving plans over time, while others may choose to invest in the family home or their business,” McWhorter said. “Due to the amount of University resources committed to need-based grants, and because of the similar financial strength of such families, we include these assets in the evaluation of a student’s eligibility for need-based aid.”
In some ways, Oberreiter understands this point of view — she thinks middle-class families have just as much of a responsibility as the University does in paying for college tuition. 
“It sucks, but I don’t think it’s unmanageable. If I had to pay for all of USC, if my parents hadn’t saved any money, that would be unmanageable, and I would not be here,” Oberreiter said. 
Melguizo also said that there are other options that make college more affordable for middle-class families, even if they didn’t think ahead to save for college.
“Middle-class families have a lot of what we call social and cultural capital, and they’re very good at navigating very complex financial aid systems, so that’s something that they clearly have in their advantage,” Melguizo said.
Melguizo cited parental involvement and transferring from a community college as two examples of social and cultural capital. Ultimately, Melguizo doesn’t see the middle class squeeze as the biggest problem in college affordability. 
“I don’t personally think there’s such a big squeeze — I think that the fact that university costs are out of control is something that affects everyone, and in some cases, it might affect even more low-income students,” Melguizo said. “As a policymaker, I would be making sure that those extra dollars support the populations of students that would benefit more from that support.”

Organizers said they reached out to people from different disciplines to form the USC team that faced UCLA in a mapathon on Wednesday at the Polymathic Lab in Leavey Library. Photo courtesy of Andy Rutkowski.
The first mapathon competition between USC and UCLA took place on Wednesday at the Polymathic Innovation Lab in Leavey Library. Its goal was to assist the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team by examining satellite images and identifying geographic features and infrastructure, building data that other humanitarian groups can use to do their work on the ground. 
 Librarian Andy Rutkowski said the lab had previously held a mapathon to provide data for the Red Cross to determine where aid could be delivered in Puerto Rico after a devastating hurricane struck the island in September. Rutkowski initially reached out to the Spatial Sciences Institute to recruit members for their first mapathon to address the immediate damage caused by Hurricane Maria.
 “We were doing the building outlines” at the Puerto Rico mapathon, Rutkowski said. “A lot of that work was being done for the Red Cross so they would know where to set up for each station, where people live or where infrastructure would be.”
 This is the first time USC and UCLA competed against each other to determine who can map the greatest number of features. Rutkowski and UCLA GIS Coordinator Yoh Kawano of the Institute for Digital Research and Education spearheaded the initiative.
 In addition to the Polymathic Innovation Lab and Spatial Sciences Institute, members of SC Mappers and the USC mapathon team supported the event. Seniors Natalie Milistein, Precious Nwaoha and Alex Chen all volunteered to help Rutkowski run the event and attract campus attention through social media and a booth stationed outside of Leavey Library.
 Chen, the vice president of SC Mappers, said the event appealed not only to students interested in geodesign, but also those across all academic disciplines. Chen added that he was particularly drawn to humanitarian mapping because of its potential to effect real change. 
“I feel like it really exemplifies that, whatever your skill set or background, you still have some capacity to … do something to improve a lot of other people around you — not just in your community, but around the world,” Chen said.
 USC and UCLA were not the only institutions working on the humanitarian mapping event. According to Rutkowski, over 150 mapathons occurred all across the country and world during the event. During Wednesday’s mapathon, students collaborated on projects from around the world including Mexico, Colombia, Mali and the Philippines. 
Milistein said that through the humanitarian mapping, she was able to “organize change to help underserved communities” — and the prospect of working across environments to form relationships with institutions across the world was a common sentiment. Rutkowski called it “transformative.”
“Being connected to the space, our lived environment … I feel like something like this has such a positive impact, contributing information and data so people can know they are doing great work, great humanitarian work,” Rutkowski said.

A Dornsife course titled “Global Governance and Health: From Global to Local, will be led by Institute for Global Health Associate Director Heather Wipfli, who also developed the curriculum. Photo by Riya Goel | Daily Trojan
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will offer a new course in international relations that focuses on global governance and health in Summer 2018. 
The course is part of the Problems Without Passports program, which utilizes problem-based learning strategies for students studying societal problems in a foreign country. The class, titled “Global Governance and Health: From Global to Local,” will allow undergraduate students to travel to Switzerland and Uganda in a three-week trip led by Heather Wipfli, associate director of the USC Institute for Global Health and the course’s developer. 
“I’m always telling students they need to go to Uganda and they need to go to Switzerland, and they really need to have the experience of both programs, [so] the intention is to provide undergraduate students with these experiences in global health and specifically in global health governance,” Wipfli said. 
For several years, Wipfli has taken her graduate students to Geneva, Switzerland for the World Health Assembly, where World Health Organization members discuss and finalize major health policy decisions. On a separate trip, Wipfli led other graduate students to Uganda to do more community-based learning and attend specialists’ briefings from government and health professional agencies to better understand the influence of these health initiatives on rural communities.
To give college students a better look at global health governance and its significant impact, Wipfli combined these two graduate-level courses into one undergraduate program where students can travel to both Switzerland and Uganda in one trip.
“The model of [the Problems Without Passports] courses allowed me to go ahead and think big [to] develop the comprehensive approach to the program,” Wipfli said. “Students will have the opportunity of being at the United Nations level to walking and experiencing very rural, basic health delivery all in one go.”
Wipfli said that the course is especially fitting for students majoring in global health and international relations, as well as those on pre-medical or pre-law tracks and want to witness health care on an international scope. According to Wipfli, many study abroad programs focused on health sciences mainly consist of clinical work. However, she hopes that the course will expose students to the diplomacy and negotiation aspects in health care. 
“We discuss U.S. policy, and then we go to Geneva and see how the U.S. policies are discussed and presented, and then we go and see how their aid delivers on the ground,” Wipfli said. “You can see the president’s plan for African relief. You can follow it all the way from our local Congress through Geneva all the way down to Uganda.”
Alumna Sandra Najuna, who serves as a project coordinator for the USC Institute for Global Health, has worked alongside Wipfli on both trips to Switzerland and Uganda. She said that combining the two into one program provides not only a bigger picture of the implementation of global health but also a more holistic and comprehensive view of it. 
“When you start at the World Health Assembly and see how plastic and almost boring the discussions are — everyone is just agreeing with the other countries — you can then filter it down to the ground and see how everything flows in a more positive way,” Najuna said. “You see how the World Health Assembly has almost nothing to do with what is on the ground.”
Through this course, Wipfli hopes students gain a greater sense of awareness and appreciation for the complexities of global health on the international level, especially the policy frameworks used to address health issues. 
“I just hope that they come away with a true passion for the work and understand the overriding spirit and culture that permeates global health at all levels, like one of partnership, of collaboration, of humanity,” Wipfli said. “That’s something that is present at all levels, so I hope they come away with that.”

The Graduate Student Government sent a letter to the United States Congress on Wednesday expressing graduate students’ concerns about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the latest Republican-sponsored bill proposed to modify the existing tax code. 
The letter, which garnered more than 450 signatures, was a direct response to several provisions in the proposed bill, including one that would repeal the graduate and professional students’ tax-free tuition income. Instead, the stipend students receive from working at universities would be taxed as regular income — creating a situation where students can “barely survive on their stipends,” the letter stated.
“We stand together and urge your opposition to the provisions in this bill that impact members of the higher education community,” GSG said in the statement, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan. “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has many provisions that not only adversely impact universities, but graduate and doctoral students specifically.”
The letter addressed House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.
GSG also coordinated phone banking efforts on Wednesday to congressional representatives to voice its opposition to the bill. 
There were key provisions up for repeal in the bill, the letter noted, that GSG felt would adversely impact USC and its students.
“[The bill] will also make it difficult for universities to recruit graduate-professional students,” the letter said. “Ultimately, this hinders the progress of research and innovation at our institutions of higher learning.”
Undergraduate and graduate students can also currently receive up to $5,250 in tax-free income from an employer that can be applied to educational funding. The proposed policy will repeal that provision, which GSG argues will limit the educational and professional growth of employees and students.
The letter also expressed concerns about other provisions being considered for repeal, such as the student loan interest deduction and Hope Scholarship Tax Credit, and the creation of a tax on universities’ endowments.
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on its version of the bill this week, according to POLITICO. The Senate, which created its own tax plan, elected to keep tax-free tuition income.
GSG did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Associate head men’s basketball coach Tony Bland had been charged with bribery and fraud last September. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Associate head men’s basketball coach Tony Bland pleaded not guilty to four charges on Wednesday after being arrested in an FBI bribery and corruption case in September.
The arraignment took place in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, a week after Bland was indicted on charges that include bribery and wire fraud, along with seven other men.
Bland along with Lamont Evans, an assistant coach at Oklahoma State, entered a not guilty plea on Wednesday, a day after Auburn’s Chuck Person and Arizona’s Emanuel “Book” Richardson did the same. 
Bland allegedly took bribes from would-be sports agent Christian Dawkins and financial adviser Munish Sood and helped facilitate payments to two USC players or recruits that amounted to $9,000 in total. 
Dawkins also pleaded not guilty on Tuesday, as well as Adidas executive Merl Code.
Bland’s attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, called the case “a waste of government resources” in an interview with the Los Angeles Times and said he did not know what the evidence was.
USC held sophomore guard  De’Anthony Melton out of the team’s first two games, releasing a statement that there were eligibility concerns surrounding the sophomore guard. Melton’s attorney, though, denied any wrongdoing and said that multiple investigations had cleared Melton. 
Though some coaches from other schools involved in the investigation have been fired, Lichtman said that USC has treated Bland well.
 “USC has been incredibly decent to him,” Lichtman said to the Times. “I don’t think the schools are following each other in lock step.”
