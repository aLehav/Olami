On Tuesday, Annenberg’s School of Journalism and the Center on Communication Leadership & Policy hosted “Spotlight on Hollywood: Women and Entertainment Journalism,” a series of conversations focusing on women and leadership in journalism.
Girl power · Journalist Mary Murphy, one of the four on Tuesday afternoon’s panel, discussed the role and influence of entertainment journalism in the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The discussions explored the journalism under news media, the transformation of journalism caused by the digital age and issues of news’ accuracy and reliability.
“The biggest thing I [learned] is the blurring between the real entertainment news versus the influence corporations have over the news,” said Ron Rothstein, a USC alumnus in attendance.
Panelists discussed their experiences working for various publications and how they found their voices among editors.
Jen Garcia, a senior writer at People Magazine, said that she did find a voice as the youngest editor, but always had to fight for her stories.
“Editors do respect people who speak up,” added Kasia Anderson, a former editor at Truthdig and The Wrap. “[If] you speak up, editors do respect the credible reasons behind that.”
“Even though they were all from different companies, they all seemed to agree on most things,” said Barbara Estrada, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “Most of the people there worked for newspapers or magazines and they all seemed to agree that journalism has evolved from what it was 10, 20 years ago.”
Panelists also discussed hiring practices. Vice President and Managing Editor of Variety Kristen Wilder said she cares most about whether an applicant is a good writer.
“While I’m hiring new intern or entry level positions, I want [the person] to be a journalist that can write well, clearly and accurately and spell your words right,” Wilder said. “If you are passionate about telling the truth, finally one day you will bring it into publication.”
Event organizer Liz Krane said that even though the event was a late addition after a panel about sports journalism was cancelled, it went off “without a hitch” and brought an important perspective to attendees.
“I thought that was really good to hear that they are frustrated also. It’s not just people reading magazines and being frustrated with the fact that Justin Bieber is everywhere as opposed to more important news,” Krane said. “It’s just good to hear that that’s a real thing that they deal with but at the same time it’s still possible to push for a story that you’re really interested in.”
Krane said the best part of the panel was getting advice from actual professionals in journalism.
“I think it was Mary [Murphy] who said editors really like it if you speak up for yourself, that was my favorite bit of advice,” Krane said.
Estrada said she hopes to work in the entertainment industry and had the chance to ask panelists for advice on how to break into the industry.
“They said just get experience, it doesn’t have to be somewhere that’s nationally known, it can be somewhere small or local, you can just work your way up,” Estrada said. “Get involved in anything else related to journalism on campus to help you build a strong profile, people already know that you have experience.”

Don Mitchell, distinguished professor of geography at Syracuse University and recipient of  MacArthur and Guggenheim Fellowships, spoke to USC students and faculty on the creation and significance of public space, specifically its role in relation to the homeless, minorities and protesters.
In his talk, “People’s Park Again: The Ongoing History of the End of Public Space,” Mitchell examined changes in public space. The professor argued that since there is not a concrete definition of public space, the majority of the intellectual community tends to define public space in terms of what it is not.
“An image or a shared understanding of … what public space is … is mostly assumed,” Mitchell said. “The image [of public space] appears to be one of … relatively open access [and] little capital control over the full functioning of the space; light policing.”
While Mitchell says there is much debate over which modern spaces, such as malls or campuses, constitute public space, he turns to urban theorist Mike Davis’ definition of public space.
“Public space is the space where changes in the city [are] fought out.”
Such conflicts are evidenced by demonstrations of urban unrest in public spaces.
“Public space is a space of conflict and is essential to the creation and resolution of conflict,” Mitchell said.
He turned to the examples of the necessity of public space in civil rights protests and gay pride parades.
“Public space is a space for organizing and protesting … [and is] essential for political people,” Mitchell said.
Minority groups as political actors in public spaces further emphasize this point and bring forward new questions about what exactly public space is.
“The increased presence of women, of gays, of minorities in public space … raised, in new ways, the question of who public space is for,” Mitchell said. “[Their] insistence on being present and visible in public space forced dominant society to confront its exclusions.”
Mitchell explains the similar function of homelessness in cities in relation to public space.
“The crisis of homelessness, which many interpreted to be a crisis of public space … [forces] the question of public space; what it was for, who belonged in it and who didn’t,” Mitchell said.
In fact, the professor claimed that homelessness is central to understanding the conflicts of public space, and it was actually what led him to researching this field originally.
“As a college student at San Diego State, I was so pissed off at the world around me,” Mitchell said. “Seeing the homeless just lying there on the streets … so unjust … I have an anger and passion about the issue that never left.”
It was his work on homelessness that led him to examine public space and its relationship to homelessness in communities.
Mitchell explained that states approach the issue of the homeless in public spaces as a matter of health, sanitation and safety.
“Homeless people’s use and occupation of public space is seen as necessarily detrimental to order,” Mitchell said. “Homeless people either directly ruined or lead to the ruin of public space, in this argument.”
As a result, new laws regulating quality of life emerged.
“Quality of life laws developed to govern homeless people’s use of public space, or perhaps to remove them altogether.”
Mitchell warns that this could become the worst-case scenario of what could happen with new public space regulations.
“The worst thing that could happen … [would be] the clearing out of homeless people who have nowhere else to go.”
Mitchell says that individuals can take action in or outside of activist groups.
“[It is important to] find ways to work in solidarity with people who have no other place to be but in public.”
He also argues that while housing is often regarded as the solution to homelessness, it is not enough.
“Being outside in public spaces is valuable to the homeless, as it is to us.”
Mitchell also encourages individuals to find opportunities to transform spaces, such as malls or chain restaurants, into public spaces.
Mitchell points to a growing conflict in Queens, N.Y. between McDonald’s and the elderly Korean immigrant population who buy a cup of coffee and then sit at McDonald’s for the day, which turns the fast-food eatery into a “public space.”
“Personally, the thing that I do is try to learn and explain … to understand and to research,” Mitchell said.

The USG Senate meeting on Tuesday night featured presentations from USG’s University Affairs Committee and Arts Committee.
Director of University Affairs Andrew Menard updated USG Senators on several projects to improve the quality of USC student life, both on and off campus.
University Affairs successfully reinstated a bus transportation service to LA Live for USC students. Though feedback has been positive, the committee wants to make sure students are aware of the service so that funding continues.
“This is really big to publicize — if we don’t get people going, we might lose it,” Menard said. “Most of the feedback has been really good, but it’s important to get the word out.”
In addition to reinstating the shuttle service, University Affairs had success in improving dorms on campus. So far, printers have been installed in Fluor, Parkside, New, North and Pardee for students to use.
The committee is looking forward to further dorm renovations scheduled for summer of 2014.
“We’re getting new flooring in Troy, as well as soundproof windows in New, North and Marks,” Menard said.
University Affairs is focused on more immediate goals as well. Over the course of the semester, University Affairs plans on improving Campus Cruiser’s operating system, as well as extending hours for the Farmer’s Market on McCarthy Quad.
After University Affairs presented, Fabiola Avina, director of USG’s Performing Arts Committee, gave a presentation to announce upcoming events her organization is sponsoring. These events include a visit by transgender performer Rebecca King, as well as the highly-anticipated USC Arts Week.
“USC Arts Week is our biggest initiative this semester,” Avina said.
Arts Week starts the week of March 31, and will include programs that showcase the artistic talents and interests of USC students.

On a cold, cloudy Friday night, a single high-strung Japanese rock band set the glistening crowd at Club Nokia ablaze. The crowd itself was ready to spontaneously combust on its own as it anxiously sat 20 minutes in anticipatory fervor. Fans waited at least three hours ahead of time to ensure a guaranteed spot in the mosh pit.

For the disappointed fans that were cut off from entering the first floor of Club Nokia, the second floor held a slightly promising aerial view of the band. Normally the second floor provides a better angle of the performer; however the venue filled up all the way to the far sides of the second floor, which blocks out half of the stage from sight. As the lights dimmed and darkness obscured the stage like an invisible black curtain, angry grumbles and excited shrill voices were drowned out by a wave of ear-numbing cheering and whistling.
One by one, the band took its place on the stage under a veil of shadows as the speakers thundered with the heavy bass of the introductory song. Prepared with horns and fist pumps, the crowd uncontrollably cheered when lead singer Taka sprang out on the stage edge to greet the sold out venue. To return the crowd’s enthusiastic cheering, ONE OK ROCK launched a flood of violent sound on the welcoming Los Angeles crowd. The band did not hold back; members gave their A-gameby opening the show with two of their most intense, head banging numbers which transformed the already restless full house into a fist-pumping goliath. For the next two hours, Club Nokia shook harder than a building undergoing liquefaction during an earthquake.
ONE OK ROCK’s discography includes many songs that combine both English and Japanese lyrics but, interestingly, the group’s style can be described as a blend of rock and post hardcore with a hint of screamo. During the band’s introduction, each member spoke in English, but eventually admitted they could only speak the English lines they had rehearsed beforehand. Even so, they wooed the crowd by showing off their knowledge of English innuendo by tastefully sliding in a “that’s what she said” joke before returning to their performance.
According to Taka, the band is known as ONE OK ROCK in the United States, whereas in Japan, it is known as One O’ Clock. The name refers to the time the band used to practice on weekends. The band noted that in the Japanese language, l’s and r’s sound the same, so they changed the “o’clock” to “o’crock” which later became the pun: “ok rock.” Anytime they ask, “What time is it?” the crowd is expected to say “one o’ clock!”
Surprisingly, the band felt comfortable with the Southern California crowd as all but one member donned casual clothing. Ryota, the group’s bassist, wore nothing but a low hanging pair of sweatpants and graced the crowd with his chiseled upper body. On the other hand, the band’s leader and guitarist, Toru, wore a conservative collared long sleeve T-shirt, black jeans and leather loafers. No matter what they wore, they all danced around the stage, encouraging a fervent continuation of high energy in the crowd. With high jumps off small stage step ladders with intermittent back and forth dashing, the band owned the stage as if it were their own garage practice room in Japan.
Friday’s concert marks one of the many Japanese musical performances in Los Angeles over the past six months. The sold out concert holds a promising outlook for future and upcoming Asian performers as more international artists play at bigger venues to larger crowds. Prior to ONE OK ROCK, Dir En Grey and Back-On both saw a huge crowd turnout that propelled a massive push to bring more Asian musicians to America. Another popular Japanese artist, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, is coming back for her second LA concert on Sunday Feb. 16.
The diverse age, gender and cultural turnout at these concerts exemplify the need for more visibility of international musicians as they prove to be just as popular as domestic musicians. Furthermore, these concerts provide an opportunity for fans of all backgrounds to come out and support their favorite band. An especially devoted fan held up Mexico’s national flag throughout the concert. A young boy intensely cheered with his mother on the edge of their seats on the second floor. He eventually ran out of steam, however. By the time the encore rolled around, he was lying exhausted as his mother still swayed left and right with her son in her arms.
Pleasing both old fans and new fans alike, the band played songs from their first massively successful album, “Niche Syndrome,” to their newest album, “Jinsei×Boku=.” But during one of the slower songs called “Be the light,” hardcore fans stuck out their lighters and joined in with the cellphone lit light show. This caused a small scuffle between the fans and security as more than one person had to be escorted out for unruly conduct. Aside from this minor blemish, the crowd engaged in no other extreme action other than mirroring the band’s head banging and hair flipping maneuvers.
In comparison to previous Japanese rock performers, ONE OK ROCK’s kickback song “The Beginning” was a surprise as the crowd expected to hear another body thrashing song before the night ended. Understandably, this last song was used to bring the concert to a full circle as the band intends on coming back to Los Angeles and that this show was only “The Beginning.” Of course, that was not their last song. The crowd relentlessly yelled “encore” in both English and Japanese until oscillated cheers reverberated throughout one’s veins. After the world’s longest minute, ONE OK ROCK jumped out of the sides and triumphantly waved their welcoming banner, full of well wishes by their endearing fans.
As homage to the many great rock bands before them, the band closed the night with their slow power ballad, “Wherever You Are.” The song promised the crowd that the band will return to Los Angeles in the future but until then, they will “always be by [our] side.” In the final chorus of the song, Taka showed off his singing prowess one last time as he tightly clenched his microphone and bellowed out a mighty “I love you L.A.!” while holding his F-sharp note for a lengthy 10 seconds. Strangers and friends alike put their hands up to the ceiling one last time and joined as a single entity that waved farewell like a parent to a child who is leaving for a bright, prospective future.
Even though the show ended on a subdued song that left the crowd waving their hands high to the strum of the electric guitars, exhausted fans jumped and wailed at the night sky. Some mustered up energy from their depleted bodies to push and shove to form a line in front of the merchandise booth. Overall, the show left fans wondering how they just spent two hours continuously jiving to one of the best rock concerts of their lives.

March Madness is right around the corner. Guess who won’t be participating? If you guessed “The USC men’s basketball team for the third year in a row,” pat yourself on the back. If you haven’t heard, Trojan basketball has been in a bit of a slump as of late.
Running point · USC head coach Andy Enfield’s presence has already been felt on the recruiting trail, even as the Trojans struggle on the court. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The common thing to say in this situation is, “We’re just not a basketball school.” Oh, Trojan faithful. There are no “basketball schools” or “football schools” — thinking only makes them so. And Trojan roundball fans have probably been doing a lot of thinking, especially after another letdown against “that other school across town” last Saturday.
At the root of this thinking is recruiting. USC dashed the Bruins’ hopes in football recruiting last week with the addition of two five-star recruits in the eleventh hour. Consensus national top-10 recruit Adoree’ Jackson in particular was clear in saying that a certain running back during the Pete Carroll era (the one not named Lendale White) was influential in his decision to don the cardinal and gold. And why wouldn’t it? USC has a star-studded pedigree to rest its laurels upon during the football recruiting process.
To most people, this “pedigree” could similarly be applied to UCLA basketball. For every Troy Polamalu, Brian Cushing and Clay Matthews the Trojans send to the NFL, UCLA sends a Kevin Love or Russell Westbrook to the NBA. The reason this analogy seems tenuous is because it is: The vast majority of blue chip basketball recruits stick around for one or two years before leaving for the NBA, whereas in football, players are required to stay at least three years.
This essentially leaves each basketball program at the mercy of a recruiting carousel: Each year a roster is filled out with veteran players and, depending on the program, a couple of young “blue chip” recruits to lead the pack — unless you’re Kansas or Duke, in which case you’re “at the mercy” of a constant blue chip recruit carousel.
USC has its own top-flight player in the 2014 recruiting class in Jordan McLaughlin of Etiwanda High School in Etiwanda, Calif. The point guard is nationally ranked as the sixth best at the position by ESPN, and received offers from Kansas, Indiana, and “that one basketball school across town.”
McLaughlin turned down all of those schools and is officially signed to play for USC head coach Andy Enfield and the Trojans beginning next season.
Considering this result, creating a program of top recruits in basketball seems slightly less complicated than the process for building a football team insofar as that it relies heavily on the potential minutes provided for the recruit to showcase his skills before moving on to the NBA. USC’s relative dearth of top-shelf talent allows recruits to showcase their abilities to NBA scouts relatively unobstructed.
Enfield’s coaching style in his tenure with Florida Gulf Coast has already made an impact in the recruiting arena: He signed nationally ranked power forward prospect Malik Price-Martin despite offers from more “basketball-focused” schools closer to home including Louisville, Kansas State and Memphis. Price-Martin cited Enfield’s wide-open style of play as the reason for choosing the Trojans.
Similar to how the Trojan football program’s pedigree precedes it, Enfield’s reputation and coaching style also precede him. The former maestro of “Dunk City” can parlay USC’s vast resources and impressive facilities to coax recruits into “buying into” the Trojan Family. The signing of Price-Martin and McLaughlin are both steps in the right direction for USC to rise to national prominence as a basketball program.
The short tenure of basketball recruits also translates to a shorter timetable for a turnaround. Regardless of human resources, it will be on the Trojans to return to winning ways beginning next season. Enfield’s one-year probationary period is coming to a close, and the Trojans will be expected not only to be competitive in games — which they’ve managed to do all season — but to actually win games, and land an NCAA Tournament bid.
All things considered, it’s been another “rebuilding” year for the first full season after the Kevin O’Neill era, one that Andy Enfield will certainly remember. And despite the consensus focusing on USC’s shortcomings in basketball this year, it only stands to reason that it will get better from here.

Usc needs a young super star that dos it all. San pedro high school has one this kid does it all. He can turn a program around. Let the highlights of him speak for it self. Go quincythomas 2012/2013 san pedro high. Highlights
The Trojans have a # of good players themselves in the NBA right now. O.J. Mayo at Dallas,
Taj Gibson with the Bulls, Nikola Vucevic with Orlando, Nick Young with the Lakers, and the
very hot Demar DeRozan at Toronto. A good starting five although no bench at all.
Personally thinking Coach Enfield has not justice with the team this season especially in the
Pac-12. A 7’2 center in Oraby has not been utilized enough in the offense that still focuses on
“Dunk City” baloney. His halftime adjustments have been mediocre to non-existent for almost
the entire season up to this point. Talk about recruiting, the team has the Ca. Gatorade Player
of the Year in Roschon Prince who is languishing on the bench recently. Where is the development
of him and also Jovanovich this far into the season.
Steve made excellent points.  It is one thing to be shoot across the sky for a single season, coming out of a crap conference and surprising people with an unusual style. It is another thing to deal with a deep conference that looks at what you do and adjusts to it.  
USC has 6 players in the NBA now (Steve left out Dedmon I think because he isn’t starting) and that is the same last year as Georgetown, Ohio St.. Syracuse and more than Louisville, LSU, Marquette, Wake Forest, Colorado, Memphis, UNLV, Michigan, Michigan St and all but a few teams in America.  And until the sanction mess USC was going to the tourney as much as anyone for a stretch, and recruiting outstanding classes (several players in the NBA now were signed to SC before sanctions led them off to UA and other schools).  With those players we released we would be in the top 10 in players in the NBA, never mind the loss of players in subsequent years.    
SC has not had a problem in being a hoops school or a recruiting school. I just dunno if Andy Enfield was the right man though I like him a lot.

It seems that championships have become par for the course for the USC women’s golf team, and this week’s Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge proved to be no exception.

Sophomore Annie Park coasted to her fifth career individual title yesterday while her team survived some late struggles to claim yet another victory in Palos Verdes, Calif. The Women of Troy extended their school-record winning streak to eight events, including five straight wins to begin the 2013-2014 campaign. This tournament, which ran from Sunday to Tuesday, was the team’s first event after their winter hiatus.
Though this type of success can lead to overconfidence, senior Sophia Popov is well aware that continuing to win will not come without hard work and commitment.
“We [worked] extremely hard over winter break, and really looked forward to this first event,” Popov said. “We are hoping to keep the momentum we established in fall to help us not only succeed at this event, but also for the rest of spring season and all the way up to nationals.”
USC finished the tournament at 14-over, a collegiate course record, even after their worst round of the tournament. The team’s four qualifiers combined for a 15-over during yesterday’s action. No. 5 Duke made up 10 strokes on the Women of Troy but could not close the gap any further, ending the tournament in second place at 21-over. No. 7 Arizona State took third at 23-over, while No. 2 UCLA and No. 11 Washington tied for fourth at 29-over. The four Pac-12 rivals, along with the Blue Devils, figure to battle for the national title come May.
Head coach Andrea Gaston was proud of her team’s success, but knows yesterday’s round could have been much smoother.
“Obviously we were happy to have a cushion since we didn’t play as well today,” Gaston said. “There were some hard hole locations that cost us a few shots today. Duke played really well and really pressed us down the stretch. Thank goodness they ran out of holes.”
On the individual side, Park dominated the scoreboard during the first two rounds, shooting consecutive 4-under 67s in what were often windy conditions. The Levittown, N.Y. native took a comfortable lead into yesterday’s third round, and weathered a disastrous back nine that included five bogeys on her way to victory. Park ended the day with a solid 2-over 73, raising her tournament total to 6-under. Haley Davis of Baylor finished in second place at 1-over, followed by Duke’s Yiu Liu, Arizona State’s Noemi Jimenez, Oklahoma’s Alexandra Kaui, UCLA’s Bronte Law and Florida’s Sarah Schober at 2-over.
Popov, whose school record for wins was tied by Park yesterday, fired a team-low 1-over 72 in the third round to finish with a three-day total of 4-over. Popov’s score tied her for 10th place with Arizona State’s Monica Vaughn.
Sophomore Kyung Kim, who came into the day expecting to compete with Park for the individual crown, struggled throughout the third round and finished with a disappointing 5-over 79. Kim’s worst round in a USC uniform only bumped her into a 12th-place tie, an indicator of the course’s difficulty. Rounding out USC’s qualifiers was freshman Karen Chung, who finished the tournament at 14-over.
The Women of Troy now head to the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, La., which is set to begin Feb. 23.
The team will hope to continue their incredible run of success as they move into the heart of the 2014 schedule, and all signs point toward this goal being accomplished. The team returned their entire lineup from their 2013 NCAA championship-winning season, and is the favorite to recapture that crown.
Still, Popov is seasoned enough to know that nothing is a foregone conclusion.
“Our team is in great shape,” the senior said. “There are a lot of top-ranked schools that are going to try to make it as hard as possible for us.”
Gaston echoed her senior leader’s sentiments.
“[Assistant coach] Justin [Silverstein] and I are proud of the team’s eighth victory in a row, something we don’t take for granted,” Gaston said. “At the same time, a day like today reminds us that we have to get back to work to help each of our players get better prepared for our next tournament.”

Another year older, another year wiser. That is the supposed mantra propelling the USC baseball team into the 2014 season, one in which they hope to fare better than the disappointing 20-36 overall record they posted last year with a .500 winning percentage in the Pac-12 conference.

This year, USC head coach Dan Hubbs is prepared to make the necessary changes to turn the team around.
Hubbs made his debut during the 2013 season after former head coach Frank Cruz was fired for violating NCAA regulations regarding the amount of time players can spend participating in activities under the supervision of the coaching staff.
Much of the inaugural season for Hubbs involved experimenting with and searching for a winning formula. The lineup, rotation and bullpen were subject to change as player performances fluctuated and freshmen were inserted into tough spots. This season will be different, Hubbs claims.
“You’ll see a more stable lineup this year as opposed to last year where guys were flying in and out of the lineup,” he said. “We’ll see more stable roles on the staff whereas every time we looked down at the bullpen [last season] we were figuring out who was going to be able to step in and do something.”
Hubbs is taking his knowledge from last year and applying it to this year’s strategies. Some of his pitchers progressed last season while the development of others stagnated. Hubbs will prioritize the seven to 10 pitchers on the mound who have demonstrated improvement; five or six will barely pitch.
Similarly, Hubbs said that 13 or 14 position players will get the majority of at-bats. The other players who don’t get starting time will have to work hard to earn pinch running or defensive replacement roles from their teammates who have already won jobs on the field.
Though Hubbs vows to cement his players into certain roles, many positions remain open and will be finalized in the first few weeks as he figures out how to fill holes left by last year’s departures.
The Trojans lost outfielder Greg Zebrack and infielders Adam Landecker and James Roberts to graduation, but the team added nine true freshmen. A young team last year remains a young team this year, with 24 underclassmen compared to 11 upperclassmen.
“We’re young in age, but we have more experience now,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Last year we were young in age, with zero experience all across the board.”
The majority of the Trojan team is in the sophomore class. Hubbs said those 13 players went through growing pains last year, but that he expects them to have outgrown their inconsistencies.
Some players won’t have the luxury of enough time to make that leap. A few freshmen have landed spots in the lineup including Frankie Rios, who will play shortstop, and Jeremy Martinez, who will be in the lineup either behind the plate or as designated hitter.
A couple of returning players have locked in their roles. Seniors Dante Flores and Kevin Swick will man the infield at second and third, respectively. Last year’s freshmen standouts in Timmy Robinson and Vahn Bozoian will likely return to center and right field, respectively.
There’s a lot of competition everywhere else. Sophomore infielder Blake Lacey will start the season out with a back injury, leaving the Trojans thin in the middle of the diamond. The jobs at first and left field remain open.
Though the competition is stiff, the players aren’t feeling the pressure to outperform each other.
“There doesn’t seem to be a worry of, ‘Hey, this guy is competing for my spot,’” Hubbs said. “It’s just, ‘Hey, we want to be the best team we can be.’ So how are we going to help each other out to get there?”
One clear way to accomplish this goal will be boosting offensive performance.
Scoring runs was one of the primary difficulties for an offense that tied for fifth in team batting average, but ranked tenth in RBIs and runs scored, and tied for last in wins in conference rankings last season. The problem wasn’t hitting; it was scoring.
Hubbs said that last year’s assistant coach Matt Curtis, who has since assumed offensive coach duties, and assistant coach Vinny Lopez have helped with plate approach, recognizing strengths and instituting plans for each player.
Hubbs also attributed some of the team’s offensive woes to young players trying to achieve too much at the plate in high-pressure situations. He is confident that the team has developed new strategies that prepare them to drive in runs in a variety of ways, instead of last year’s tried tactic: waiting for the elusive big hit.
“I think our short game is better in terms of our bunting and our ability to manufacture runs this year,” Hubbs said. “I think we’re much more prepared to score those runs that we had out there last year.”
The Trojans will have a chance to prove their head coach right when they open the season against the Northwestern Wildcats at Dedeaux Field on Friday. It’s a long trip for Northwestern, but not one that’s unprecedented.
“I don’t think it’s unusual for a cold weather school to want to come to a warm weather climate,” Hubbs said. “They obviously haven’t been outdoors much with the weather back in the Midwest but I think they’re going to be a good opponent.”
Though Hubbs recognizes the talent that the team in purple possesses, he recites a familiar phrase: the team plays against itself, not against its opponents.
“We’re looking to sustain a level of play and an expectation of play throughout the season that becomes a part of our identity,” Hubbs said. “Rather than, ‘Hey USC played really well today’ … I don’t think that should be a surprise to anybody when last year I felt it really was.”
Junior Wyatt Strahan will start Opening Day, followed by senior Bob Wheatley on Saturday. Hubbs said he hadn’t decided Sunday’s pitcher because he’s still toying with who he wants as closer.
The first game of the season starts at 6 p.m. this Friday.

Ground Zero is a hidden gem of the USC campus. Located in the corner of campus, and surrounded by freshman dorms, it is easy to miss. Recently, Ground Zero Performance Café at USC has begun serving a variety of new items. Aside from their classic milkshakes, Ground Zero has always sold a variety of baked goods and beverages.
Zero to hero · USC’s on-campus dining options just got better with the addition of new menu items at Ground Zero Performance Café. The café now carries food options from several local eateries. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
Ground Zero now has bagels from Brooklyn Bagel Bakery, baked goods from Bittersweet Treats, and cookies and bars from Action Cookie. The bagels and baked goods are in a refrigerated display case to the left of the counter, whereas the cookies and bars are on the counter next to the cashier.
Opened in November 2012, Bittersweet Treats, also known as Bittersweet LA, is based in Pasadena, Calif. — 15 miles northeast of USC. Over the past year, it has developed a reputation for being a homely dessert shop and bakery with enough variety to please nearly anyone, and has already become one of the more popular and well-known bakeries in the L.A, area.
Ground Zero currently has Bittersweet’s caramel cake, chocolate crunch cake, brownies, blonde brownies, “whoopie pies” and cupcakes. Whoopie pies are a red, heart-shaped cupcake with frosting sandwiched in the middle, whereas the caramel cake is, as the name indicates, a sweet, caramel-flavored cake, baked in an attractive pinwheel mold.
The highlight of the Bittersweet Treats items, however, is definitely the chocolate crunch cake. The chocolate crunch cake is taller than its width, and is covered in a thick layer of light meringue. The filling consists of multiple layers of chocolate cake and frosting, with a rich chocolate taste that is not too sweet, and contains the crunchy texture that is its namesake.
The brownies are also solid, both literally and figuratively. They consist of the bitter taste of cocoa intermingling with the sweet taste of sugar, solidified into a dense square of moist brownie. The chocolaty, chewy consistency of the semisweet brownie makes it a winner. At the time of writing, Ground Zero currently has no lemon bars.
The bagels are from Brooklyn Bagel Bakery, a family-run bakery that was, ironically enough, founded and based in Los Angeles. Located in between Historic Filipinotown and North Westlake, Brooklyn Bagel Bakery has been in Los Angeles for over 60 years now.
Ground Zero stocks plain bagels, 9-grain bagels, pizza bagels and “everything” bagels. All flavors besides the plain cost $2.50 with the plain bagel being $2. Cream cheese is an extra $0.25. The bagels are nothing special, just your standard flavors with the exception of the pizza bagel. Not too dry, with just the right density and consistency, the bagels at Ground Zero are what bagels should always taste like.
Though Ground Zero is better known as a place to watch SComedy and live music performances -— not to mention a place get late-night milkshakes — the bagels should definitely encourage more people to come buy breakfast and coffee there in the morning as well.
Lastly, the items from Action Bar are chocolate chip cookies and “California Power Bars.” The chocolate chip cookies are your standard well-baked chocolate chip cookies. Chewy with semisweet chocolate chips, it’s a large circle of sugary, chocolaty goodness. On the other hand, the California Power Bar is anything but standard. A quick glance at the ingredients list on the back reveals everything from the standard rolled oats and a variety of tree nuts to more bizzare ingredients, such as pinto beans, roasted yam and ground coconut. The resulting combination of ingredients, however, still results in a filling and tasty power-bar that is also vegan and gluten-free.
For a student who typically only makes quick trips to Ground Zero, the new baked goods definitely add some variety to the menu. No item costs more than $4.50 and nearly every item is a solid choice. The addition of bagels definitely adds some much-needed variety to what was otherwise a fairly limited morning menu, which was previously limited to scones and coffee or tea. The brownies and other desserts add another option for students who dislike milkshakes, while the power bar is a convenient option for students cramming for upcoming midterms or looking for a small meal in between classes.

The second Annual LA Bacon Festival that kindly reminds patrons to “Get your Lipitor ready” took place this past Saturday at the Petersen Automotive Museum -— by the time I found out about it, I was too late to purchase tickets. As a self-proclaimed foodie and bacon lover, I failed all that I stood for by not attending this sold-out bacon extravaganza. Luckily, there’s always next year — but looking over everything I missed makes my mouth water.
“Featuring dozens of restaurants and bakeries, the event will pay homage to all things bacon, presented in both sweet and savory dishes,” the festival website said. Both the general and the VIP admission included tasting of the participating businesses’ signature dishes and access to explore the Petersen Car Museum. The VIP admission also included cocktail tastings, admission an hour earlier and some surprise, bacon-filled perks. Admission was limited and sold out in advance. In other words, I completely missed out on a great culinary experience.
This mishap of events got me thinking — what about all of the other young foodies out there, do they know about these things? Are they as tuned in as I am? Then it hit me — I should tell the world of all the great food-lover happenings that take place throughout Southern California. Thus, I have compiled a list of the most important food festivals in SoCal, starting with Valentine’s Day.
Valentine’s Day has to be one of the busiest times of the year for restaurants, caterers, bakeries, jewelry stores and maybe even credit card bills — but one thing remains true: It celebrates love. As a single lady, I will be celebrating my love of food starting at the Riverside County Fair & National Date Festival, which celebrates the date — the fruit, that is. The festival starts Feb. 14 and ends on Feb. 23 in Indio, Calif.
There are a whole slew of foodie festivals that take place in SoCal, but unfortunately many of them require people of “proper age.” On tap for March is the Ultimate Beerfest to take place in the beautiful Pasadena Convention Center on March 15. This International Beer Expo “is the largest international consumer beer expo in North America,” according to the festival’s website. “The expo features exhibitors from around the world including: breweries, homebrew equipment and supplies, beer sampling and a consumer’s choice beer competition. The Ultimate Beerfest International Beer Expo puts everything from the world of beer all under one roof.”
Tomatomania! To take place from March 21-23 in Encino, Calif.; March 29-30 in La Canada Flintridge, Calif., and April 5-6 in Claremont, Calif., and Westwood, Calif., is the world’s largest and “most fun” heirloom tomato seedling sale.
Come April, the Scandinavian Festival of Southern California will happen at the Kingsmen Park at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, Calif., where “both days of the festival are filled with music, dancing, food, lectures, demonstration, vendors and activities for young and old alike.” Also according to the festival website, “the Viking Encampment and Sami Village will once again be present.”
Locals in Southern California probably know about The Original Renaissance Pleasure Faire that happens every year, which offers no secrets or surprises as to what this event has to offer. When I was a middle school student, I had a classic, wacky science teacher who made costumes, acted and worked some of the venues at the fair — which might explain a lot about how she taught her class. The Original Renaissance Pleasure Faire has two things that I am very fond of: giant turkey legs and silly people. The blend is perfect for a lovely trip to good ol’ Irwindale and is around long enough (Saturdays and Sundays, April 5-May 18) that you can plan to go with friends and family.
Summer-time means a couple of things for USC students: internships, summer jobs, maybe some tanning — but also summer school. When planning to stay in SoCal, fun is an essential that should be included and a daytrip to my hometown is necessary. The Watermelon Festival will take place at the Rose Bowl from July 26-27 and will feature an “evening of good food, amazing live music, contests, games, exciting activities, demonstrations and of course free, all-you-can-eat watermelon,” according to the festival’s website. This festival is a good way to promote and support local agriculture and cool down from a long week of studying.
Festivals are great, but they are even better when food is involved. So this year, make sure to spend lots of time eating and really enjoying what this beautiful world has to offer.

Get ready to head-bang and thrash in some mosh pits as Cathercist comes to the Whiskey a Go Go in West Hollywood this Saturday.
Oh my mosh · Cathercist, founded in 2010, prepares for their tour across the country, in an attempt to gain a more widespread following. The band will perform for the first time in Los Angeles this Saturday. – Photo courtesy of Festivals for All
Though the quintet is considered a hard rock and metal band by most, lead guitarist Taylor Roberts said that it is more of an amalgamation of different musical influences.
“We’re too hard to be hard rock but we’re not hard enough to be metal, so we’re kind of a nice little in-between,” Roberts said. “We hate labeling the genre that we’re in. We play music and we like to have a good time.”
The name “Cathercist” comes from a play on the word “catharsis,” which Roberts defines as the purging of emotions through music or an action.
“There were a bunch of other bands called Catharsis out there, and we were like, ‘We really love the meaning of the name,’” Roberts said.”
So they tweaked the wording, and while no other group can lay claim to it, Roberts said the name is often taken not-so-seriously.
“It’s really opened us up to a lot of medical jokes,” Roberts said. “It’s both a blessing and a curse. We actually invite people nowadays to see who can come up with the funniest play off of our name. It used to bother us at first, but now we’re like, ‘What can you come up with? How can you top what we already know?’ It’s almost like a game at this point. You’ve got to be able to laugh at yourselves.”
Despite Roberts and bass player Hollis Godsey hailing from Mississippi and the other three members from Mobile, Ala., the band doesn’t incorporate its Southern roots into its sound.
“We’re all huge fans of modern rock and metal — not huge Skynyrd fans or anything like that,” Roberts said. “I think the fact that we are from the South makes us want to not sound like we’re from the South. Not that we’re ashamed of that, but we want to represent our own brand. In our area, we’re really some of the hardest bands out there. It almost kind of pushes us away from a Southern feel.”
The band officially formed in 2010. Before that, Roberts and lead vocalist Zack Sawyer would play shows together, and members would drift in and out — their guitarist left due to military obligations, for example, and rejoined last year.
It wasn’t until four years ago that they pinned down official members, and three years ago that they released their debut album, The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer. Their second album, As Hope Expires came out May 25 of last year. Roberts said the second record was much more representative of the group as a whole, as it drew upon their shared ideas and inspirations.
“The first record was mainly myself and Zack, and on this last record, it was more of a collective effort,” Roberts said. “Everyone pitches ideas, everyone helps, everyone writes, and so it was different in the fact that it wasn’t just two people converging on ideas — it was five people.”
Though the collaboration was different, the recording process behind both records was the same.
“We did both albums in a week, which we really hated, but at the time, we were all still working 9-5 jobs, and we can only carve out a week of time before we get fired,” Roberts said. “I feel like both records were really rushed, and the next one we do, I’d definitely like to take two or three weeks to record 10-12 songs, and then spend months on pre-production prior to that, as opposed to going in there guns blazing, and saying, ‘Well, I hope we get this done.’”
Despite their own youth, with band members ranging from 20 to 24-years-old, Roberts said they don’t necessarily have a specific demographic they try to target.
“We have people who like us from ages 12 to 60 and everywhere in between,” Roberts said.
Cathercist does a lot of touring — the tour the band is on right now, which takes them to the Whiskey a Go Go, will last for another three weeks.
“We’re going everywhere from Mississippi to Cali, up to Minnesota and Wisconsin, all throughout West Virginia and everything else like that,” Roberts said. “We’re trying to maintain ourselves on the national circuit as opposed to the regional thing. We try to keep busy because in this business, if you stop playing or you go away even for a month, you’re almost irrelevant.”
Roberts said there are both ups and downsides to being on the road.
“I love the fact that music is taking me places that I would have probably never gotten the chance to go,” Roberts said. “I would have been stuck at home working a 9-5 job, scrounging for money to be able to go to some of these places, and now we’re getting paid to do this … My least favorite part is probably travel time. Sometimes tensions boil up because you’re stuck in a van with four other dudes. It gets kind of trying sometimes.”
Despite having so much experience with live shows, the band has never performed in California, let alone Los Angeles, and is looking forward to the change of pace at the renowned Whiskey a Go Go nightclub.
“It’s a legendary place, and just to be on the same stage as some of the greats is really cool,” Roberts said. “I’m really hoping people are going to be drunk as s**t and going nuts and excited to be at a rock and metal show. I don’t know what my expectations are — a mosh pit here and there, and people going crazy.”

Vergara vs. California, a case currently being argued in an L.A. courthouse, could reshape the relationship between students, teachers and schools. The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of nine students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, seeks to revamp the teacher dismissal and tenure process in the district, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The nation’s second largest school district presently has several policies in place that make the process of becoming a tenured teacher much easier than firing one. Tenure, the process of giving a teacher a permanent post in a school, was originally intended for professors in schools of higher education but expanded to include teachers in public schools. In addition, the lawsuit seeks to eliminate the “last hired, first fired” policy which states that in cases when the school district seeks to lay off teachers, the most recently hired teachers will go first.
Today, approximately 2.3 million public school teachers in the United States have tenure, according to Time. Though tenure does not guarantee a lifetime of employment, it makes it more difficult for the school district to fire an incompetent teacher. The plaintiff’s argument largely focuses on the disadvantage tenure creates for students in low-income and failing schools. They argue that those students already have a small teaching pool and any ineffective faculty further disrupts the already difficult learning process many students face.
L.A. schools Superintendent John Deasy is a proponent for the reformation of tenure laws. He testified that the time frame for granting tenure is not long enough to see how effective and fit a teacher is in the classroom. The California Teachers’ Association has pushed back by saying that eliminating tenure laws will not address the root of the problem, which lies with the school districts.
The public debate surrounding tenure and job security has been taking place for years. The media and protests, such as the 2010 Waiting for Superman that focuses on the U.S. education system and the 2012 teachers’ strike in Chicago that drew nationwide attention and affected more than 350,000 kids, helped progress the conversation. Eventually, however, the excitement of it faded away.
This court case, which is in its third week of trial, has the power to really change the tide in the conversation and create a definitive — and divisive — ruling on tenure, at least here in Los Angeles. According to the LAUSD official website, the school district boasts approximately 640,000 students enrolled in K-12 at 115 campuses across the city.
Though teachers have limited power and should be compensated for their hard work, the status quo should be improved. More efficient incentives can be made.
Tenure should not be handed out so easily. There is no doubt that being a teacher is an incredibly rewarding position, but also one of the most draining career paths a person could choose. Yet this does not equate to immunity.
In several other public service positions, such as the police department and fire department, accountability to constituents is a necessity to keep the system functional. In the same way, teachers must constantly be evaluated and kept on their toes because their jobs will inevitably shape the minds of the country’s future leaders.
Within U.S. schools, like with many other institutions, there is inequality. Teachers, just like any other profession, like to have job security. Students, as with any other step in their young lives, need the knowledge that comes through teachers and a solid education. By extending the average amount of time it takes for a teacher to gain tenure, the nation can fulfill its promise to students that the best experience in school can be afforded to them — regardless of economic background.
The most important decision that can come from this case is the decision to move forward and seek reform. The judge’s ruling either in favor or opposition to California teacher tenure should not discourage teachers, parents and school districts from trying to find a way to improve their students’ learning experience by providing them with the most qualified instructors possible.

On Sept. 18, Scots will have the opportunity to make history by deciding whether or not to sever its 307-year union with the United Kingdom and become independent, according to The New York Times. Though U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron recently said that an independent Scotland would weaken Great Britain as a whole, such a historic move would strengthen Scottish interests.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
Independence would give Scotland the opportunity to focus on its own national issues. Though Great Britain does provide a sense of security and stability for Scotland, that does not distract from the fact that Scottish interests are always secondary to the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. For example, the Scottish government is strongly opposed to the bedroom tax (a housing tax) claiming that it disproportionately affects Scots. Scotland’s share of claimants affected by the bedroom tax is around 16 percent compared with Great Britain’s population share of 8.6 percent. Furthermore, 79 percent of households in Scotland affected contain an adult who has a recognized disability, compared to 63 percent in Great Britain. An independent Scotland would provide Scots with a stronger voice locally, more political freedom and a more democratic parliament.
Scots would also have more control over their oil reserves, and newfound control over Scotland’s defense and foreign policy. With the additional power gained from independence, Scotland can strengthen its cultural identity.
There is, however, concern about the viability of an independent Scotland. It is unknown if an independent Scotland will have trouble dealing with major economic or military problems, and without the backing of Westminster, there would be less security. Yet Scotland leaving the auspices of the United Kingdom is like a teenager moving out of the parent’s house — risky, but necessary for a better future.
Assumptions of failure without a unified four-country United Kingdom are grounded in pessimism. Smaller countries such as Denmark rank higher than the United Kingdom on multiple rankings, such as poverty level and political liberties. Danes are completely fine. There should be no doubt that Scotland cannot do the same.
Great Britain’s opposition toward Scottish independence is understandable. Without Scotland, it would be face new problems about borders and income. It’s estimated that Great Britain would lose 90 percent of the North Sea’s oil, according to the Guardian. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s economy would be slightly affected, particularly when it comes to goods such as oil and whisky.
If Scotland were to leave the United Kingdom, it would weaken the sterling and leave Scotland’s share of the United Kingdom’s debt in limbo. Thus, Scotland is highly likely to continue the use of the pound instead of developing its own currency or switching to the Euro. Considering the negative impact on British interests likely to occur with Scottish independence, Britain will most likely allow Scotland to maintain the sterling as its currency to lessen its own economic problems and uncertainties in lieu of Scotland agreeing to pay its fair share of debt.
Scotland has already been politically autonomous from the United Kingdom, so independence is a logical next step. In addition to enjoying their own sense of strong national identity, Scots have their own national flag and Parliament. At the regional level, Scotland is already very autonomous. Since referendum elections in 1999, Scotland has been ruled under regional assemblies, thus having autonomous rule over regional taxation, education and economic planning.
The current referendum is this generation’s opportunity to take a stand for Scotland’s independence. Most Scots already agree that the Scottish Parliament should have greater autonomy over its financial and legal powers. As an independent nation, Scotland’s economy and social policies could ultimately flourish. Independence does not need to mean severing its ties from England completely. Rather, it would give Scotland the opportunity to control its own destiny and grow to its full potential — alongside its neighbors.
A “yes” vote on the referendum would only be the first step — Scots would still have to deal with issues regarding how to divide the North Sea oil fields, the share of the U.K. debt, defense, currency and more. But such a vote is necessary in ensuring that Scotland receives the autonomy and recognition it ultimately deserves.

The Olympics are often seen as a time of international unity, when countries can set aside their differences in order to celebrate humanity’s greatest athletic achievements. Unfortunately, the Olympics just as often evoke both blatant and subtle forms of political posturing that highlight cultural differences rather than commonalities. In the buildup to and commencement of this year’s Winter Olympics in Sochi, everything from terrorist threats to internet memes featuring Russia’s unpreparedness have distracted from the games’ intended message. But perhaps the spirit of the Olympics is too platitudinous to be realistic, or even relevant.

One need only look to two singer/rapper superstars from different sides of the pond to realize just how different “similar” countries and cultures are, even in our globalized age.
Similarities between Drake, 27, and Stromae, 28, begin in their childhoods. Both had white mothers and black fathers who were relatively absent. Both grew up just across the border from the countries in which they are most popular. Stromae, or Paul van Haver, is from French-speaking Belgium and Drake hails from Toronto, although his father lived in Memphis.
In the last five years, both have developed into dynamic artists who are challenging the conventions of popular music, with their unique integration of rapping and singing. They also bring an unprecedented level of introspection and sophistication to the top of the charts. And, interestingly, their most recent album covers are eerily alike.
Despite their similar demographics, their musical differences come out in the different cultural norms and realities of their countries of origin. Stromae’s music contains significant African influences, which is likely because the black community in Western Europe is largely composed of recent immigrants. Drake, on the other hand, is a product of America’s proud hip-hop and R&B legacies. Stromae employs elements of house, which Drake almost religiously shies away from, which could be attributable to the genre’s prominence in Europe.
The differences are driven further through their aesthetics. Although handsome, Stromae is very skinny, and almost waifish. He often wears bow ties, and other clothes that might be described as “nerdy” in the US.

Drake, on the other hand, is the definition of a male sex symbol. Everything from his lyrics to his portrayal in media and his highly publicized romantic exploits corroborate his sexualized persona. Drake reeks of a uniquely American vision of “cool,” as evidenced by his Instagram which features photos of himself in exclusive clubs with his elite clique of friends, like Johnny Manziel and Nicki Minaj. Stromae’s Instagram is quirky rather than cool — a recent post shows his legs from the knee down in green tights and felt shoes.
Green tights aren’t cool or edgy in America, and as it happens, neither is socially conscious pop music. Stromae’s most critically acclaimed song, “Papaoutai,” is a more redemptive exploration of a real socio-cultural issue than anything Drake has ever released. Drake is unique among American rappers for his sensitivity, but only within his own life, not the larger issues of our world.
In this era of hyper-globalization, we are often reminded of how different we are in more subtle ways. Stromae and Drake remind us that the US and Western Europe are still fundamentally unique cultural universes.
And even in spite of international rhetoric during the Olympics, our cultural output suggests that we are still deeply proud of our differences.

I really enjoyed this article on Stromae and Drake, mostly because I really like seeing Americans take a liking to Stromae and his music. I think his lyrics are so beautiful and that he sings about the things we really should be talking about. Hopefully, Stromae will get some more exposure over here and plan a US tour!
