Somini Sengupta, a Hearst visiting executive in residence at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has worked at the New York Times for 20 years, the past several of which at the climate desk as the international climate correspondent. From her coverage of the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, to profiling youth climate activist Greta Thunberg, Sengupta is a media professional incomparably versed in global climate politics — offering an international, analytical perspective. The Daily Trojan spoke with Sengupta Thursday about the present and future of climate change and its subsequent media coverage.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: In my own coverage of environmental issues, I always try to tie up my stories with a neat resolution or call to action, but when it comes to climate, things aren’t always that clear-cut. So how do you strike a balance between ambivalence and positivity in your own reporting?
Somini Sengupta: My goal is to help my readers understand the world better and to hold the powerful to account … Hopefully, I’ve explained something that matters to my readers and moved them, surprised them, made them angry. Not every story does all those things. So every story serves a slightly different purpose. Part of my job as a reporter is to show my readers, to show the general public, what people are doing to solve problems. That could involve activists who are marching, that could be lawyers who are taking companies to court, that could be economists who are studying the impacts. Broadly speaking, that could be researchers, scientists, who are telling us what has already happened because of historic emissions and what is projected to happen. 
DT: Speaking of climate change, a good graph, chart or photo can make climate change phenomena feel a lot less abstract. So what would you consider a good climate change visual, and what traits would something like that include?
SS: That’s really mind-blowing, and hopefully easy to grasp. Hopefully, easier to grasp through visuals than through words … So we always discuss among colleagues: what’s the best way to tell this story? 
DT: When you reported from Glasgow last November, you called COP26 the ultimate platform for global collective action. How much of the action took place  was actually outside of the plenaries and diplomatic sessions, and how did you see youth activism playing a role? 
SS: There were negotiations inside, there was advocacy inside, there was advocacy outside. I think I wrote the Monday after the negotiations concluded that, now, it was really up to what happens in government legislatures around the country, what happens on the streets of those big polluter countries, how much pressure lawmakers in those countries face. And, by those countries, I will tell you the three most important countries are China, the United States and the countries of the European Union, because those are, by far, the three largest emitters — historically and currently … Expect a lot of litigation in the coming months and years, both against governments on the legal claim that they are violating the rights of their citizens and against companies for the pollution that they have already caused. 
DT: Can you speak a little bit about the amount of empathy that it takes to translate something from science to a story? How do you weave a compelling narrative that gets people to care about something that might not yet directly impact them?
SS: It’s hard to imagine a person who is not directly impacted by global warming already. It really truly is, but I think you’ve raised a really important word in the craft of journalism, and that is to mobilize empathy. Part of my job is to step into the shoes of others and listen to their stories, write about their experiences and bring that to life — make that relatable to someone who lives a very different life …. You want your readers to be able to relate to the place or the people you’re writing about in some way. 
DT: Do you think it’s more important to reach as many people as possible, or do you have a particular audience or public in mind with your work?
SS: Especially when it comes to climate change, I think it’s everyone’s business. So I’d like to expand my audience as much as possible, and also I like to help people understand who don’t think of themselves as interested in climate change or who don’t think of themselves as environmentalists … It’s important to tell the climate story in so many different ways because it’s really not an environmental story; it’s much broader. It’s a human story. It’s changing the human condition. 
DT: One thing that I think about a lot is the intersectionality of climate change and how it exacerbates lots of systemic issues that are far outside the realm of just the environment. How do you attempt to incorporate all of this into your work? Do you ever struggle with the sheer vastness of it?
SS: Absolutely. Every story doesn’t have to incorporate the sheer vastness of it. In fact, if it does, it’s not really a story, right? … We write very different kinds of stories. We write stories about scientific research. We write stories about a debate that’s happening over a particular public policy. We write stories about interesting people who are doing really cool things. We write stories about efforts underway to address climate change, including to adapt to climate change. 
DT: How do you maintain your mental health when you’re dealing with heavy topics?
SS: Journalists in various fields cover heavy topics that can be a lot because our job is to bear witness … My job, many times, is to bear witness to the suffering of others, and you carry that with you. So I think it’s really important to do three things: Always know why you’re doing this — what is your purpose? … Two, be with your people. Find people whose company you enjoy … Find people who get you, who know what you’re doing. 
We have some choices about how we want to show up for ourselves, for our communities, for the natural world that we are a part of … Even if you can’t solve all the problems of the world yourself … Part of finding your purpose is really trying to figure out, “What am I good at? What’s my role in making a difference in whatever way I want to?”
DT: Are there any pressing issues that we should be paying attention to that aren’t necessarily getting significant media coverage?
SS: In the months ahead, what journalists and citizens’ groups in general could be paying attention to are all these “net zero promises.” Because we’ve seen, in the last year or two, a real acceleration of all kinds of promises from companies, governments and organizations to be carbon neutral or net zero. There’s not really an agreement about what that means — how do you get there? How much are you doing? … Particularly in the United States because we’re a big economy and we have a big climate footprint.

Olympic track athlete, USC alumna and social activist Allyson Felix will deliver the address for the upcoming 139th commencement ceremony, the University announced Thursday.
Felix had a widely successful career as a track and field athlete. Track & Field News named her the High School Athlete of the Year in 2003, and while attending USC, she earned her first Olympic medal: a silver in the 200-meter dash at the 2004 Athens games. After graduating in 2008, she brought home 10 more, including seven gold, for a total of 11 Olympic medals. 
“Allyson has already inspired the world as a runner and used her platform to push for women’s health and women’s rights,” President Carol Folt said in a press release. 
Her most recent resurgence to the international spotlight came in 2019, when she began speaking out publicly about the athletic industry’s maltreatment of pregnant athletes. Her op-ed for the New York Times published that May accused her sponsor, Nike, of threatening pay cuts and refusing to waive financial punishment for substandard performance, and called for better treatment of working mothers in and out of the athletic industry. Public outcry after the op-ed’s publication culminated in a congressional inquiry, and Nike later revised its maternity policy to guarantee athletes’ pay as well as additional maternity protections.
Since then, Felix has ended her contract with Nike and became the first sponsored athlete for Athleta, a women’s apparel brand. In 2021, she launched her own women’s lifestyle brand, Saysh, which she announced via an Instagram post showing her medals and C-section scar.
Felix is now retired, last appearing at the Tokyo Olympics.

After multiple online learning extensions, USC students and faculty returned to the classroom Jan. 24 for the second in-person semester since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. In a series of interviews with the Daily Trojan, professors, staff and teacher assistants expressed varying degrees of approval, dismay, and concern about the return to in-person classes. 
John Vidale, a Dornsife College Letters, Arts and Sciences professor of geophysics and seismology, expressed concerns about the University’s timing because of the omicron surge’s trajectory and said that, “ideally,” instruction should have returned two weeks later than it did.
“It’s unfortunate that [the return was Jan. 24], but they had to pick a date a while ago, and they’ve changed it a couple of times,” Vidale said. “So it’s a little risky, but actually, a lot of us are pretty enthused.”
Vidale also said planning involves an inevitable amount of extrapolation, and that maintaining scheduling credibility and adjusting the in-person start is difficult. Ultimately, Vidale said, the return is the “right thing given the circumstances.”
The Keck School of Medicine of USC Chief Mental Health and Wellness Officer Dr. Steven Siegel said he is “entirely on board” with the current in-person plan. Siegel cited concerns about the pandemic’s challenges for new staff members who have not had the chance to “support each other” over the last “18 to 20 months.” 
“Not only are we stressed by the risks to our health, but we don’t have the comfort of each other’s company,” Siegel said.
Sociology professor Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo said she is “delighted to be back on campus” after nearly 20 months away. Hondagneu-Sotelo, who only teaches during the spring semester, spoke positively about the University’s coronavirus procedures. 
“As one of the older people on campus — I’m 64 years old — I know I’m at higher risk than our 20 year olds,” Hondegneu-Sotelo said. “But honestly, with vaccination, boosters, masks — and I hope USC did make changes to our air ventilation systems in our classrooms — all of those things give me a sense of security.”
Because of high case numbers compared to last semester, and for personal comfort and pedagogical benefits, both Vidale and Hondagneu-Sotelo opted to return to in-person instruction with hybrid classrooms. Both professors, however, questioned the hybrid modality’s adaptability in settings outside their own — such as “language, theatre, music [and] hands-on labs,” Vidale said.
Hybrid options have not been afforded to everyone, however. Some staff members said they received mixed messages from the University both before the fall semester and for the spring semester’s in-person return. 
Initially, staff were instructed to submit requests of accommodation to the deans’ office in August, which offered from one to five days of hybrid work. These accommodations were promptly rescinded in an email released Sept. 8, reinstating a full five-day on-site schedule by Sept. 15 as sponsored by the Provost’s office. A staff member who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation and maintaining their employment said the University’s messaging felt “patronizing.”
“We were working the whole time,” they said, “We were not on some sort of extended leave or vacation or anything the last two years and getting paid for it.”
Another staff member, who also requested anonymity for fear of retaliation in their workplace, spoke to the University policy’s discrepancy between expectations for staff and those for faculty. 
“At the end of the day, we all work for USC,” they said. “We want to all be treated fairly and equally and safely”. 
The disparity also demonstrates the “hierarchy” and “old boys’ club” that exists in University leadership, the second staff member said, something meant to be the “antithesis to what USC and the Trojan Family stands for.”
For some faculty and staff, contention remains from last semester over the lack of transparency from University officials. After the University failed to disclose modeling calculations for the Jan. 24 return, Hondagneu-Sotelo said the absence of “reassuring evidence of the HVAC systems, the HEPA filters,” concerned her.
“USC is a wonderful university in many aspects. But transparency? Gets a C minus from me,” Hondagneu-Sotelo said. 
Emily Warren, a doctoral student studying the history of premodern Japanese food and a TA, said she questions the benchmark the school uses to derive its data. 
“I don’t know what the data looks like that the University’s banking its calculations on,” Warren said. “I don’t know if we’re privy to that as students, or which faculty are privy to that information.”
Warren said she is also greatly concerned about the flexibility and channels for coping offered by the University toward staff caring for immunocompromised individuals.“I just would like to be reassured from the University that those people do have the wider support and flexibility,” Warren said. 
The staff members interviewed anonymously said the limited flexibility they’ve been allotted this semester can be “solved through hybrid work.” Coronavirus state-mandated sick hours that expired in September 2021 did not roll over, according to Cal Matters. At present, staff who care for ill family members or who become sick themselves need to pull days from standard sick leave. To decrease the incentive for staff to come into work sick, one staff member said they’d like to see the University offer extended hours for employees affected by the coronavirus.
“Having that safety net of the extra hours would be something that USC could look into reinstating despite what the state legislature says: Let’s do something not just because we’re told we have to,” the staff member said. “This is where you could have some olive branch to employees … Let’s reinforce that idea of community.”

The Conference of Champions has recently been anything but.
Four teams have a losing record. Three teams haven’t won a game on the road. One team, Utah, had lost 10 games in a row but got its first win since December on Thursday.
However, those lackluster stats don’t matter if the conference can send an ample amount of teams to the NCAA Tournament. If five Pac-12 teams sneak into the Big Dance, the conference will look fairly competitive in the overall college basketball landscape.
Now, five teams isn’t much to write home about. For comparison, the Big 12 sent seven teams in the 2021 NCAA Tournament alone, a feat the Pac-12 has not matched since 2016. Still, five is a step in the right direction, given the conference sent just three teams to two of the last three NCAA Tournaments.
The conference’s top teams  seem locked for the tournament. UCLA (16-3), Arizona (18-2) and USC (19-3) could all make the NCAA Tournament even if they decided to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas instead of playing out the rest of the regular season. The Bruins and Wildcats could even find themselves as one of the top seeds in the entire bracket.
The rest of the Pac-12 field is a bit murkier. Oregon (14-7) looks like it has set itself apart from the rest of the pack with recent wins at UCLA, at USC and a 28-point bludgeoning against rival Washington. The Ducks are only held back by their initial 6-6 start, but the team could still coast to a tournament berth if it continues its strong play for the remainder of the season. 
The fifth tournament spot is where the Pac-12 will have to hope one of its teams has a strong end of the season to enter the tournament as one of the last teams selected. There are quite a few programs vying for this spot, but let’s narrow it down to the most likely candidates: Washington State, Colorado, Stanford and Washington.
Let’s get the Huskies out of the way. Washington is 12-8, ranked 141 in Ken Pomeroy’s ratings and does not have a single quad 1 win to its name (The KenPom ratings rank teams based on offensive and defensive efficiency, and quadrant wins show how strong a win was, with quad 1 being considered a very strong win because of how good the opponent is). 
Washington is not the team to bet on to round out the Pac-12’s wealth of teams in the NCAA Tournament, but, with upcoming games against Arizona, USC and UCLA, the Huskies will have plenty of opportunities to improve their resume. If Washington can win just two of those games in that three-game stretch, the Huskies may put themselves right into the bubble conversation. Oh, and Washington has the conference’s leading scorer, too.
Stanford is another unlikely candidate for the tournament, but the Cardinal is worth mentioning because Stanford has the most quad 1 wins among all Pac-12 teams. Now, two of its four quad 1 wins came against USC, but they count all the same. That schedule’s strength is likely to get the Cardinal some respect when it’s time to decide on the NCAA Tournament’s slate of teams.
A team to bet on to make the cut is Colorado. The Buffaloes may not be that great of a team (and the analytics show that with the team ranked at 97th in KenPom), but Colorado has one of the easiest schedules imaginable. 
Remember the four teams in the Pac-12 with a losing record? 
The Buffaloes play six of its final eight games against those teams. Colorado currently sits at 13-9 but could easily end the season with 10 losses or less and put themselves squarely in the bubble discussion.
But, at this point, the favorite in the Pac-12’s fifth bid to the NCAA Tournament should be Washington State. 
 Aside from the Cougars’ strength of schedule, the analytics love the Cougars, with KenPom ranking them 33rd and the NET rankings boasting at 38th. These analytics are crucial pieces of the puzzle that put teams into the NCAA Tournament, and they look favorably upon Wazzu. The Cougars slightly derailed Colorado’s chances of a tournament berth as well after the Cougars throttled the Buffaloes 70-43.
The main hurdle for Washington State to overcome is its brutal schedule to close out the season. Opposite of Colorado’s luck, the Cougars face the four best teams in the Pac-12 five more times before the season ends. This stretch could either build Washington State’s resume up or shatter the Cougars’ hopes of a tournament berth.
See how it’s not too hard to come up with five Pac-12 teams that can crack the NCAA Tournament? 
I didn’t even mention that a random sixth team might win thePac-12 Tournament to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. That would be on brand for the Pac-12 and good for the conference — two things that often do not go hand in hand.
So there’s a chance the conference isn’t as lost as it seemed just a couple of months ago.

The Trojans, despite losing again to Stanford last week, have a relatively successful away record, winning five of their six conference games outside of Galen Center. After the narrow 58-53 victory over Arizona State Thursday, USC will look to finish the Arizona road trip unscathed. 
The Wildcats boast a 7-1 conference record marked with an unbeaten home streak as they remain undefeated in Tucson after four matchups. Arizona started the Pac-12 season on prolific form, quickly managing a 6-0 start before losing against the Bruins 75-59 on the road last Tuesday. 
Arizona’s sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin will look to return to form after an efficient game against Arizona State last Saturday. Mathurin had 14 points, but was 0-for-8 from three and 5-for-16 from the field, a far cry from his conference averages of 17.2 points and 45.7% and 36% from the field and 3-point respectively. 
Junior center Christian Koloko performed well off the bench in the Wildcats’ win over Arizona State, posting up a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds. Koloko averages 13 points and 7.5 rebounds this conference season. 
With the key road matchup ahead, Head Coach Andy Enfield praised USC’s performances away from Galen Center. 
“Arizona is obviously ahead of us in the standings and they are extremely good at home,” said Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We have been good on the road … We have to continue to handle the adversity when we travel, and I think our guys have done a great job so far.” 
The Trojans’ inefficient performances from beyond the arc have contributed to their losses this conference season, as they have scored at a 35% clip from 3-point field goals, compared to the more efficient 40% performances from their opponents. 
Volume 3-point shooters junior guard Boogie Ellis and senior guard Drew Peterson hope to impress from distance. Both have maintained a 39% and 57% rate, respectively, this conference season. 
Mobile junior forward Isaiah Mobley currently leads USC in points and rebounds per game. The 6-foot-10 forward averages 14.7 points and 7.5 rebounds per game on 44% from the field in conference play.
Mobley put up 24 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 0 turnovers while shooting 9-for-21 from the field in USC’s victory over UC Berkeley last Saturday. Mobley will look to continue performing as a ball-playing power forward/center. 
Despite not brandishing the most captivating stats, captain and junior guard Ethan Anderson contributed to USC’s victory over Cal with 5 assists — the highest among all players Saturday evening, without conceding turnovers.
Enfield praised Anderson’s playmaking attributes and defensive focus in USC’s home victory against Cal. 
“[Anderson] has always been very good defensively, very tough,” Enfield said. “He played a very smart floor game; he got us into some offensive sets when we needed to … Five assists with no turnovers and good defense will help you win a lot of games.” 
The Trojans will face off against the Wildcats in Tucson to cap off the Arizona road trip. Tip-off is Saturday at 2 p.m.

USC is set to host UC Berkeley Friday in its first and only matchup against the Golden Bears this season. The Trojans are in the middle of a four-game losing streak after playing UCLA twice and Oregon, Oregon State.
USC is 2-6 against conference opponents and 9-9 on the season overall, having won the last three matchups against Cal. The Trojans have a two-game homestand this weekend with an opportunity to get back in the win column.
“We had a team meeting where we discussed what’s been happening as far as the games go,” said senior guard Desiree Caldwell in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We decided it’s time to come together and really lock in on this upcoming weekend.”
USC looks to play a much cleaner game against the Golden Bears compared to its play against Oregon. The Trojans shot just 26.3% from the field and 23.5% from the 3-point line. USC also committed 17 turnovers compared to 10 for the Ducks, while also getting out rebounded 42 to 32. 
The game ended in an 80-48 loss, the largest this season for the Trojans.
Throughout the past four games, shooting has proved to be a prevalent issue for USC, with a field goal percentage of 32.8% and just 21.7% from three.
“We need to make sure that we just make shots against zone,” Caldwell said. “We struggled against Oregon and Oregon State with their zones, so we know that upcoming teams will probably zone us as well, so we’re just prepping for that.”
The Trojans will face a Cal team battling through some rust. The Golden Bears have not played a game since Jan. 21 after having their last three games scheduled before Friday’s matchup postponed.
Since the beginning of January, Cal has had seven games postponed and come into this matchup having only played two games. The Golden Bears’ 9-5 record is good for 11th in the Pac-12. 
A matchup to look forward to in this game is between USC sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins and Cal freshman guard Jayda Curry. 
Jenkins is the leading scorer for the Trojans, averaging 13.4 points and 6.1 rebounds per game on 54.4% shooting from the field and 45.5% from beyond the arc. Jenkins has proven a threat to scoring the ball from the perimeter, making shots from the mid range area and finishing shots at the basket to provide consistent scoring for the Trojans’ offense.
On the other end, Curry averages 20.3 points per game on 42.3% shooting from the field. She is the highest scoring freshman in the country, coming off a season high 30-point performance in the team’s last game against No. 2 Stanford.
Friday night’s game will also be Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb’s first opportunity to coach against her former school — she served as the head coach of the Golden Bears women’s basketball team from 2012 to 2019.
“Lindsay … had a historic legacy [at Cal],” Caldwell said. “We’re excited to go ahead and get a win while she’s wearing a Trojan uniform.”
The two-game homestand for USC begins Friday at 7 p.m.

The coronavirus has completely ravaged the country, creating an environment that’s hardly conducive to teaching. The surge of the omicron variant further threatens the viability of in-person classes and social events. It’s paramount that USC develops a more propitious hybrid format so students can still receive adequate educational experience online. 
My fall semester classes offered a Zoom option, but the online setting was fraught with issues. Some professors forgot to send the Zoom link while others wouldn’t check the chat, and online students couldn’t participate in discussion. Some professors even admitted that online students would be at an inherent disadvantage as they wouldn’t be able to see the classroom’s whiteboard. So while the nascence of a hybrid learning environment was a step in the right direction, many Zoom classes only offered a marginal facsimile of in-person classes. 
This spring semester, I’ve continued to see a lack of uniformity across my classes. There is no consensus on how or if professors will allow students to Zoom into class or any general improvements in the online format. Considering the fact that, as of Jan. 30, Los Angeles County reported 16,757 new coronavirus cases, it would behoove USC to enforce consistent hybrid learning options. 
Only one of my four classes this semester offers a Zoom option (upon request) and many of the professors have shared that, if we get sick, it is incumbent upon us to find notes from a peer – they will not offer a Zoom alternative nor a recording of the lecture. The ramifications of this are severe. 
First and foremost, the absence of a Zoom option only heightens anxiety during these already stress-inducing times. In the unfortunate event that I get sick with the coronavirus and need to quarantine, it would be unconscionably difficult to keep up with my academics. I’d have to teach myself material and rely on my peers to supply me with information or class notes. Moreover, if students don’t have an alternative Zoom option, they may feel compelled — most especially as we near midterm season — to attend class even if they feel sick.  
It is also important to note that this disjointed teaching philosophy is infused with ableist ideology. As Daily Trojan wellness & outreach director and staff writer Matthew Eck articulated, “students who do not feel comfortable returning to class for in-person instruction — including immunocompromised students and others with disabilities — must choose between risking their health to take classes in person or pausing their studies.” USC must recognize its ableist tendencies and implore teachers to adopt a supplementary Zoom option. 
While professors each have their own philosophies and teaching values, it is critical that there is a level of agreement regarding Zoom options. 
While most of my professors do not offer online alternatives, some of my peers can choose whether or not they wish to attend class in person. This variance in learning options is inherently unfair for students who may get sick or exposed and who are in jeopardy of falling behind simply because of their particular classes. 
Teaching an in-person class while simultaneously catering to online students is undeniably challenging. While it’s understandable that this teaching format is less than ideal, it is USC’s responsibility to prepare professors so they can offer students a better learning experience during what amounts to be our new normal.

Coming off of two dominant wins last weekend, No. 1 USC faces off against two ranked opponents this weekend — No. 8 Fresno State and No. 11 San Jose State. 
The Trojans have never lost to either team, being 1-0 against the Bulldogs and 42-0 against the Spartans. USC will also face off against UCLA in a scrimmage match shortly after the San Jose State game.
The Trojans will look to maintain their perfect record and continue their title defense. Head Coach Marko Pintaric said he believes it will be a tough road but that the key to the team’s success this year will be consistency.
“Our biggest challenge is, again, being consistent because we did graduate a lot of upperclassmen last season,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There’s no lack of talent on paper, but again we need to train together more and more and play together as a team. I think we will perform more consistently … I can see that it’s upward progress.”
The Trojans had 16 different players finding the back of the net in the two first games of the season. 
Joining the goal effort in her first game in nearly two years was redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns, who comes back to USC after training with the Australian National Team. 
Kearns has some familiarity with the players on the team, having practiced with them and played with some of them back in 2019 but is still trying to mesh together with the team.
“It’s definitely a work in progress with me not being here for two years,” Kearns said. “It’s almost an entirely different team, but having the girls that I did play with in 2019 helped me slide right back into the team.”
Kearns already has 10 goals on the season. In her 2019 freshman season, Kearns scored 5 goals against Fresno State and will look to repeat such an effort this weekend.
Although the game this weekend against the Bruins will be a scrimmage, it can prepare the Trojans for their later season matchups. It will be a unique experience to play crosstown rivals and the No. 3 ranked team so early in the season. 
Senior utility Claire Haas said she believes the scrimmage will help the team improve as they begin the young season.
“It will definitely show us what we need to work on early, so that we can continue to work on it when we play them next in April,” Haas said. “I think it’ll be a really good show of where we’re at as a team.”
Learning from mistakes early can help USC in its quest to repeat as national champions. The Trojans won their seventh national championship last season. They would be the first team since Stanford from 2014-2015 to repeat as the national champions.
“At the end of the day, we’re just playing for each other,” Haas said. “Winning a natty would mean a lot to our seniors graduating this year and the girls who just got back from the Olympics.”
USC hosts Fresno State Friday at 5 p.m. and will head to Westwood for the UCLA Mini Invite against San Jose State Saturday at 10:20 a.m. The Trojans will conclude the weekend with a scrimmage against UCLA on Saturday at 2:20 p.m.

In the South, we have a word to describe folks who prevail despite all odds: gumption. It is high praise and a respectful nod to the person it is being addressed to. Gumption is more than just prevailing, it is about prevailing with spirit. As such, gumption is a quality that the United Mine Workers of America striking against Warrior Met Coal possess in abundance. February marks the 10th month that Alabama-based miners have been on strike. In the new year, they continue to carry on a struggle that is inspiring, yet bleak at times. 
When I say bleak, I’m using it to refer to how little traction the strike has seemingly gained among media outlets, as well as liberal and progressive communities who seem more inclined to support a broader range of unions. 
Coal mining is a sensitive topic depending on which way you cut it. For those employed in the mines, coal mining is a job and a lifeline that pays. For those that consider themselves more environmentally inclined, coal mining might seem like pure, environmental evil in the form of a dark lump. Someone with the latter mindset might not know what to do when they’re faced with the prospect of having to support all labor strikes, including those in more environmentally harmful industries such as coal.
The answer, as you’ll come to find, is actually quite simple. Support all labor strikes, especially those in industries that have had a negative impact on the environment. This isn’t a statement that should make labor-respecting environmentalists gasp with shock. Quite frankly, this is just common sense. 
Labor movements are the greatest tool the working class has to move and shake up industries and institutions of power. In 2021 alone, the United States saw workers quit at record rates. Meanwhile, labor strikes culminated in October and November. All this was in response to economic issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which did the job of exposing just how unfairly American workers have been treated. Workers are fed up with being fed up. Workers have made it clear that going “back to normal” is not an option when the “normal” state was a period of time in which workers were paid unfairly, treated poorly or disrespected by their employers.
Coal mining strikes occupy a forgotten lobe in the American mind. The Battle of Blair Mountain, a coal strike that took place in West Virginia in 1921, remains the largest labor uprising in U.S. history. Today, it is nearly forgotten history. Like Blair Mountain, coal is also slipping away. 
However, we shouldn’t let the coal industry’s decline threaten the well-being of those who have relied on it to make a living. They deserve a “just transition,” as Jeff Turrentine puts it in his article with the Natural Resources Defense Council. A just transition means phasing out coal jobs and phasing in clean energy jobs or jobs within other sectors. It is an investment that the United Mine Workers of America, like those striking against Warrior Met Coal, understands is needed. That is why they support President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which essentially phases out coal completely by making a $555 billion investment in clean energy over the next decade. 
A person’s support of fair labor practices seems to hinge on some kind of moralistic, black-and-white view of the world without a care in the world for things such as nuance and gradual transitions. Whether or not a person decides to support a labor strike in an environmentally gray industry shouldn’t be left to a simple series of yes-or-no questions where sensitivity to the environment is the end-all be-all factor. 
This much is clear: Coal miners and their unions want a “just transition.” However, transitions can take years, if not decades. What Alabama coal miners need is for us to stand in solidarity during a time of great uncertainty. They need us to stand up against an industry that has taken advantage of them and their labor for decades. The path towards a “just transition” starts with unconditional solidarity.

Walking into the School of Cinematic Arts building for class last semester, I’d immediately catch sight of the giant “Kung Fu Panda” statue in the foyer. As I walked through the hallway, I’d gaze at the towering figure of Po, the panda protagonist, and be reminded of why I came to USC: to become the prophesized Dragon Warrior. 
Jokes aside, seeing Po did provide a sense of belonging for me. Whenever I felt insecure about my writing abilities or questioned myself in general, I would look at the statue on my way to class and think about my goal of telling stories about China and Chinese culture. I’d spin my own prophecies of who I wanted to be in the future. For me, this panda statue became a guiding force in my quest to represent myself as a Chinese storyteller. 
Perhaps, contrary to my investment in the “Kung Fu Panda” series, I don’t possess any kung fu skills whatsoever and am, consequently, no Dragon Warrior. Yet I would also argue that Po is more than just his “destiny.” 
Throughout the “Kung Fu Panda” series, Po looks to discover who he is both as and beyond being the legendary hero destined to save China. At the beginning of the first film, Po is a martial arts enthusiast eager to find out who the legendary Dragon Warrior will be, only to discover that it’s himself and that the label comes with its challenges.
As expected of an animated series, Po grapples with physical threats to the peace of China that he must battle with epic kung fu fight sequences. Also present, however, is Po’s initial struggle of not conforming to the expectations placed upon the Dragon Warrior. 
Later, his status as the esteemed Dragon Warrior leads Po astray emotionally; he doesn’t really know who he is beyond the label. Po’s constantly underestimated by his opponents and those around him, yet he ultimately defeats them with more than a mastery of kung fu but a mastery of self as he finds out more about his background. 
I’ve already written briefly about “Kung Fu Panda” in a longer feature article about Chinese representation in animation, but I think the series is worth speaking about in-depth. Particularly during the Lunar New Year celebration, I want to think about what it means to tell a Chinese story thoughtfully and artistically. Most of all, I’m reflecting more on what it means for a story to be authentically Chinese.
A 2008 New York Times article by Richard Bernstein cites Chinese sources praising the first “Kung Fu Panda” film. These sources expressed that the film largely captured Chinese cultural elements and themes that appealed to the majority of Chinese audiences. According to the China Daily, “Kung Fu Panda 2” integrated cultural imagery such as dan dan noodles and Qingcheng Mountain characteristic of the city of Chengdu, which the DreamWorks Animation team visited during a cultural research trip. 
All of this is to say that, at least from my perspective, Chinese culture is presented insightfully and with care in this series. Watching the films, it’s clear that Chinese national identity is represented in the food, the setting and the characters. It’s easy to stereotype such elements from a Western point of view, but I never got the sense that the “Kung Fu Panda” franchise negatively stereotyped Chinese culture. To me, Po’s story simply felt like a story employing Chinese elements in a way that didn’t seek to diminish or degrade Chinese identity. It was a story of appreciation.
Silliness aside, there’s a lot to love about the franchise. At the heart of the story, there’s a great inspirational core about becoming who you were born to be. All of that is rendered with China as the backdrop, where Po, the “hero” of the story, isn’t a “hero” purely because he’s a kung fu master. He’s a hero because he doesn’t let others tell him he can’t be one. 
I guess the reason why I love “Kung Fu Panda” so much is because I could relate to Po, who doesn’t quite fit in and is just trying to figure that out — you don’t have to be a Dragon Warrior to struggle with insecurities about your abilities. So, while I could argue that “Kung Fu Panda” is incredible because of its universality, there’s something to be said about a story that respects Chinese culture and values storytelling about China. There’s something significant in that, when animators create a story about belonging, it is destined wholeheartedly for its culture and audience. 
I wish everyone a happy Lunar New Year.

Few authors possess a gift for storytelling like Hanya Yanagihara — her writing ranges in multitudes, flowing with a lyricism that can coddle your heart in its palm one second and mutilate it within its grip the next. In other words, her novels are an emotional rollercoaster not for the faint of heart nor literary adrenaline celibates.   
It sounds melodramatic, but reading is believing in the case of a Yanagihara novel. Her debut novel and anthropological testament “The People in the Trees” introduced her as a magazine editor and author who does not shy away from experimental story structure. She crafted the novel like a pseudo-memoir, unreliably narrated by a scientist who discovers an anti-aging elixir on a remote island and consequently instigates the West’s colonization of its Indigenous community. 
Yanagihara’s third novel, “To Paradise,” released last month to widespread anticipation. Like her debut novel, “To Paradise” reiterates themes such as colonialism and an unconventional story structure, with three different novellas composing one book. However, the novel holds its own as a poignant, incomparable Yanagihara novel.  
“To Paradise” takes the reader through three generations of America, spanning from a parallel dimensional 19th century to the 20th century at the height of the AIDS epidemic to a dystopian 21st century ridden by rapidly evolving viruses. Themes of class, race, longing, disability and intergenerational relations lace them together, along with reincarnations of main characters in each of the three stories. 
In its first story, “Washington Square,” Yanagihara imagines an alternate post-Civil War America with normalized homosexuality and arranged marriages. The protagonist, David, grapples with his suffocating family legacy and finding a suitable husband in New York, or the “Free States.” When his grandfather finally arranges a marriage for him, he simultaneously meets and falls in love with a less wealthy man. 
David then finds himself face-to-face with a rather seen-it-before qualm: Does he settle for the older, renowned Massachusetts farmer, or does he risk his family’s reputation for his star-crossed lover? Although it promotes a romance trope on its surface, Yanagihara laces perplexity into it: paradise is subjective, and achieving it is not as simple as “following one’s destiny,” but instead involves waging sacrifices and one’s moral compass.  
The middle story, “Lipo-Wao-Nahele,” fast forwards to the pinnacle of America’s AIDS epidemic. Our protagonist, David, shifts to a young, New York transplant from Hawaii. The novella’s first half chronicles his coming to terms with his partner and his community of older, gay men diagnosed with HIV and AIDS.
The second half chronicles a letter from David’s father who recounts their tormented relationship on a plantation in Hawaii and what ultimately drove them apart. Ultimately, the novella revisits this idea of subjective freedom and how it can bring people together — or tear them apart. 
The concluding and longest story, “Zone Eight,” depicts a dystopian America in 2093, half a century after a flurry of viruses swept across the nation and decimated its population. At first glance, the reader may think “Not another story about a pandemic, have we not had enough?” 
However, Yanagihara positions the epidemics as a backdrop against a story of our new David’s coming of age, his turmoil with his fathers, his involvement in an insurgency and the birth of his daughter. In a parallel storyline 20 years later, his daughter navigates the totalitarian society with a disability after nearly dying from one of the viruses as a baby. A stunning conclusion to a monstrosity of a novel, “Zone Eight” leaves readers struggling with an existential question: Is paradise even feasible after all?  
After its release, however, the novel polarized critics and readers — many commending the novel for its daring concept matter and others panning it for its incoherence and as a lackluster follow-up to “A Little Life,” a 2015 National Book Awards finalist. 
The two novels maintain significant similarities — they both portray Yanagihara’s masterful control of her prose and unreal understanding of the human condition, which allows her to construct a psychological realism so vivid that the reader finds themselves losing track of time while wandering through its characters’ psyches. In “To Paradise,” the emotional investment that drove readers in “A Little Life” persists.  
But they also contain their differences. “A Little Life” borders a 21st-century Shakespearean tragedy on steroids. Its artistry was not only a surreal task for Yanagihara to execute, but also a near-impossible art for the reader to enjoy unless they could handle insanely triggering topics, such as physical, verbal and sexual assault, suicide and self-harm. On the other hand, “To Paradise” shines in a new light through a less traumatic, more idiosyncratic lens, which readers should not hesitate trying on for size.   
We can appreciate another addition to Yanagihara’s transcendent collection, but we must not pit her rarities — standalone masterpieces in and of themselves — against each other. “To Paradise” is far from lackluster; instead, it is a triumph of literature that, despite challenging our concept of freedom, certainly succeeds in taking readers to its own literary paradise.
