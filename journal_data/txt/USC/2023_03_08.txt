The trial for suspended Los Angeles City councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas began Tuesday morning at the First Street United States Courthouse. The L.A. politician faces federal corruption and bribery charges in relation to former Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Dean Marilyn Flynn.
At the meeting, the government and defense questioned prospective jurors for the trial, which is expected to continue until April 6. Jury selection will likely be more challenging than usual because of Ridley-Thomas’ high profile status.
District Judge Dale Fischer clarified to prospective jurors that in order to ensure an impartial trial, they were to disclose everything they know about the councilmember or any potential connection they may have that could pose a conflict of interest. Within the first few moments, one person disclosed that a close family member spoke highly of Ridley-Thomas. 
Ridley-Thomas was indicted on these charges because the prosecution alleges he conspired with Flynn to introduce, vote on and encourage others to pass bills favorable to the school in exchange for benefits for his son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas.
The indictment alleges that Sebastian Ridley-Thomas was to receive admission to a master’s program in Dworak-Peck, a full tuition scholarship and a position as a professor while enrolled in the program. University policy prohibits faculty from being degree candidates in their own department to avoid conflicts of interest.
Additionally, the charges allege Mark Ridley-Thomas intended to use the School of Social Work to funnel a $100,000 donation to his son’s nonprofit organization. University policies prohibit schools to accept and use donations in this manner.
“When the university learned in the summer of 2018 about the $100,000 payment referenced in the indictment, we disclosed the issue to the U.S. Attorney’s Office and have fully cooperated with them ever since,” wrote the University in a statement to the Daily Trojan Tuesday, declining to comment further because USC is “not a party to this matter.”
Ridley-Thomas faces one count of conspiracy, one count of bribery, two counts of mail fraud, and 15 counts of wire fraud. If found guilty of all charges, he could face a maximum sentence of 355 years, although this is unlikely. The defendant has pleaded not guilty to all charges, garnering support from his community and donors who have helped him fund a high-profile legal team.

Now in the final stretch of the current Undergraduate Student Government administration, senators introduced a slew of new changes to the organization’s bylaws and election procedures in Tuesday night’s Senate meeting in the vast draft of omnibus Senate Bill 142-47, which will be finalized and voted on by March 27. 
One of the more prominent changes in the bill was ranked-choice voting, a policy point that parliamentary secretary David Martinez initially drafted in January, citing the fact that multiple presidential candidates have yielded voting results that did not reflect a majority of the student body. This trend continued in this year’s election, where the winning candidates received 38% of the total votes cast. Martinez, the author of the bill, said that ranked-choice voting will be implemented for the 2024 election. 
In a ranked-choice voting system, voters arrange candidates in order of preference. If a candidate obtains a simple majority of the vote, then that candidate wins. In the case of no candidate gaining a majority of the vote, then the candidate with the least amount of votes is dropped and their votes are redistributed according to their voters’ preferences. 
Other changes proposed in the bill include increased transparency for registered student organizations and clubs requesting USG funding through “memos of understanding.” This proposal comes on the heels of the Senate’s Feb. 8 meeting, where various clubs voiced their frustrations at the lack of transparency and clarity regarding the process to apply for funding — which delayed the trial period of the University’s new First Generation Student Assembly and led to the denial of funds for several clubs, including Model United Nations. 
“If we did their allocations process [on] a normal timeline, then they don’t have enough time to plan their budget,” Martinez said. “What this would do is make it so the funding for those outside organizations gets decided a year in advance so that they know that their money is secure.”
Hunter Hinson, chair of the Affordability and Basic Needs Committee, said in his update that the committee has ordered two medical supply vending machines that are set to arrive in four to six weeks. One will be placed at the Physical Education Building, and the other at Dauterive Hall. 
“USG [will] hopefully subsidize prices with Plan B being somewhere around $5,” Hinson said. “It would contain over-the-counter medication, antigen services, clinical products and condoms.” 
Students from the Slavic Cultural Club also came to the meeting with a proposal to begin their own student assembly, saying they had raised $1,000 for Ukraine war relief last semester and are currently in the process of raising more than $3,000 this year. In addition to fundraising, club members created the initiative “United for Ukraine,” where they drew attention to cyberattacks on the Ukrainian government and the damaging effects of Russian war propaganda — drawing the attention of the Ukrainian government’s Ministry of Digital Transformation.
“It’s been over a year since the work has been happening, and I believe that it’s vital that we take action and have a statement of support for our entire Slavic community here on campus,” said George Kapitan, president of SCC.

USC Village welcomed Pizza Please to its collection of restaurants Monday. Pizza Please arrives at a time when there are currently no other pizza options at the Village, barring other mobile pizza operations.
Co-owners Corey Printup and Nick Crews said they were excited to open their new business venture. While neither are alumni, Printup said they are somewhat familiar with USC and the surrounding area due to their ownership of Stout Burgers & Beer. The idea for the parlor came after an examination of the available dining options in the area made them think “more contemporary” options were missing.
“We scoured the area and looked at different styles of food available that would resonate with the students here as well as residents that live in the area,” Printup said.
Pizza Please curates a trendy vibe while maintaining a traditional atmosphere, complete with exposed brick, string lights and five flat screen televisions. Things like “speed of service” were large factors in the planning and operation of Pizza Please due to students’ tight deadlines and class schedules, Printup said.
“[We’re] making sure, if you guys got a tight deadline or you gotta get from this class to the next, you don’t wait a long time to grab food,” said Printup. “And that it also tastes good.”
Pizza Please will offer “classic, New York-style pizza,” Crews said, and he believes there’s a need for the classic meals — including pizza, wings, salad, sandwiches, and more — on the campus in a fun environment. Printup and Crews’ experience as restaurateurs gives them the confidence to operate their businesses at the Village.
“What’s unique is [that] we’re restaurateurs that operate multiple locations in eighteen different brands across the country,” Crews said. “We’re bringing the best practices from those different brands to execute one of our newest proprietary brands.”
Brian Wilson, executive director of real estate development and leasing for the University, said the restaurant will have a “soft opening” with limited hours and a limited menu options until full operations start.This soft opening will last about a week. After that, Pizza Please will keep the 11 a.m. opening time, yet will close at 10 p.m., 11 p.m., or even later “depending on the traffic of the crowd,” Printup said. Full operation will also expand Pizza Please’s menu and allow it to change with the feedback and input they receive.
“Pizza Please is committed to using fresh, high quality ingredients and intends to appeal to a wide demographic audience,” Wilson said. “Their menu will adapt to the community they serve, with a menu evolving to suit the tastes of their guests.”
Pizza Please, as described by its owners, is “an approachable place” with the goal for students to hang out and grab a bite after class and stick around. With a retro, 90’s vibe, as Printup said, Pizza Please is a spot “where you can hang, gather and chill.”
Kera McKeon, a senior majoring in writing for screen and television, said the price of a slice – which is $3 – will fill a hole that USC has in terms of food pricing.
“Based off the pricing [Pizza Please] is going to fill a hole that the Village really needed, which is a place that you could eat and genuinely go because you’re like, ‘I’ve got a break in between classes and I need to eat something right now that isn’t going to cost $20 for some artisanal L.A. bullshit,’” McKeon said.
McKeon also compared the mobile Stellar Pizza and the Campus Center’s Slice Shop, neither of which she said she recommends.
“[Stellar Pizza] is $7 for a whole pizza,” McKeon said. “That was $7 for a reason. It tasted like the ingredients combined technically would have made a pizza, but what we were eating did not taste like pizza. I was not a fan of that. Slice in the Campus Center is just way too expensive.”
The new establishment is located between City Tacos and Mobility Hub. This places the shop in the footprint of the now-closed Rance’s Chicago Pizza, which closed in September 2019 after failure to pay rent.
This previous tenant left amid legal proceedings about the restaurant’s lack of ability to accept dining dollars and USC’s alleged lack of communication about the Village Dining Hall. The co-owner of now-closed Rance’s Chicago Pizza – Aaron Tofani, who is also a Price School of Public Policy alum – said in an interview with the Daily Trojan September 2019 that Rance’s “had no choice but to close.”
“[We’re] looking forward to being part of the USC community,” Printup and Crews said. “We’re open to feedback and input and want to be welcomed with open arms.”

Blvk H3ro, born Hervin Augustus Bailey Jr., appeared on the radar in 2016 with a rich seven-song project titled “The H3rb Connoisseur.” Since then, H3ro received his first GRAMMY nomination and performed at major reggae-centric festivals such as Belgium’s “Reggae Geel” and Goldenvoice’s “California Vibrations Music Festival.” It was here where the Daily Trojan spoke with H3ro. 
The interview started half an hour late, but not without reason. He had spent the morning conversing with a woman at the local Starbucks. If H3ro’s easy, lighthearted energy isn’t enough to show how personable he was, there’s something quite special about the way he takes up space. Throughout the interview, he’d smile at his team who had come along, and spoke as if talking to an old friend. 
Daily  Trojan: Would you say that H3ro is the same person as Hervin? Or do you think they are different identities?
Blvk H3ro: H3ro and Hervin is the same person. If my real name was cool, if my real name wasn’t an old man’s name from 1942, I would have used it. But God gave me the name. At one of the lowest points of my life, I was trying to pursue my passion and my family couldn’t understand. My friends couldn’t understand. I was alone. And I heard a voice say “you’re a hero.” … And once I got that name, it all made sense. I’m always kind of unhappy when I meet somebody that I look up to and they don’t match their music. I’ve made it my mission to remain grounded, remain rooted [and] remain humble as much as I can, so that everyone can have a conversation with me.
DT: You’re originally from Waterford, and there have been some other artists that have come out of Waterford. Who would you say is an inspiration to your music?
BH: Vybz Kartel, for sure. It’s so crazy, my mom and his mom were close. My mom was a seamstress, so she used to make clothes for people who go to church. So she used to go to church at the time and I used to ride my bicycle and deliver the clothes to Kartel’s mom … He’s one of my biggest inspirations for his work ethic. His lyrical ability and his defiance of everything from not being able to tour, to not be able to do something … When I walk and someone sees me, and they know I’m Jamaican, they say I’m like Kartel … I’d [also] say that Michael Jackson is probably my favorite artist of all time. From his falsettos to his business acumen to everything.
DT: After working at the National Commercial Bank for three years, you experienced being unhoused. That period was also when you began your music career, how did that happen?
BH: It’s hard to explain. There’s this [book and television] series called “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” and I like that series because that’s what life is. Instead of unfortunate, they were fortunate events that seemed unfortunate at first … I met a producer while working at the bank … and the first week of meeting him changed my life. I went to studio and freestyled for the first time. I didn’t know these things were in me. It lit the fire that led me to having this conversation to you.
DT: Would you say there’s a throughline from your first EP to your most recent album?
BH: My ability to be fearless and brave. I’m the only reggae artist who kind of really does everything. I have dancehall records, reggae records, bashment records, EDM records, pop records and R&B records … When it comes time to do my thing, I pull from every single one of those and make the best music possible … I think it’s my bravery to never be placed in a box that has remained the same.
DT: So you recently received your first GRAMMY nomination for “Neva Bow Down” with Rocky Dawuni. How did that happen?
BH: As Africans, that connection just happened through always putting in the work. When I went on my first U.S. tour last year in 2022, we just met along the way in L.A., I think in Venice, if I’m not mistaken. When he called me, I didn’t know what the record was. I didn’t know if one of my producers produced it. I went in there and just liked the record. If I don’t like it, I can’t do it … I went in and put it together on the spot. We made the record, left, and I went about my day like it was nothing. And a couple of months later, we find out it’s nominated. I couldn’t even believe it, I thought people were pranking me … And I’m in a category where I made the first reggae artist to ever be nominated for the global category. 
DT: What’s next for Blvk H3ro?
BH: God has just given me a bit of his plan. So, at this point, it’s just a series of fortunate events … I would have never guessed the GRAMMYs nomination, I would have never guessed the S.O.B. headlining show, I would have never guessed performing at Cali Vibes. I would have never guessed that I’d tell you this was the plan. So, what’s next is music for sure. I’m working on my first studio album, powered by Delicious Vinyl Island. The team is ready, I’m ready and I think musically, it’s going to be a statement.

Zaid Hassan, Sahil Rustami and Charlie McCollum — all seniors majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production — sat in Biriyani Kabob House in mid-November in downtown Los Angeles, awaiting a decision that would shape their foreseeable future. They had been one of the 10 teams in their cohort to pitch their short film to the faculty at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts with hopes for $10,000 in funding. Even with the high stakes, the team knew the final decision wouldn’t impact them — they believed in the story behind their short film “Sultana.”
“We were willing to go down fighting to the last second to make sure this film got made,” said Zaid Hassan, director of the short film. “We were like, ‘if this doesn’t get selected … we’re gonna get funding for it ourselves.”
But they did get selected, and now the almost five-month-long project is set to hit Norris Theater May 11. “Sultana” is based on the true story of the first woman Indian ruler, Razia Sultana, and follows her rise of power with themes of family, identity and culture embedded throughout the film.
Even now, everyone behind the film recalls the moment they were picked for funding with a note of wonder. Not only is it one of the four films selected by USC out of top directors, producers and writers — it’s also the first Muslim senior thesis film the University selected for funding. 
“To have this be the first Muslim film, and centered around a woman for an undergraduate thesis–I hope—sets a precedent for more stories like this to be told,” said producer Melanie An, who joined the project after it had been approved for funding. 
Screenwriter Sahil Rustami, said the team discovered their film was the first short to be funded when they found a worker for SCA’s archives.
“She searched every thesis that’s been made at SCA and put in a bunch of key words and was like, ‘yeah, you’re the first,” Rustami said.
Screenwriter Sahil Rustami didn’t intend to spearhead a big breakthrough. He had wanted to write about a strong female lead, and after searching the web for inspiration, he stumbled across Razia Sultana. Mesmerized by her life and rise to power, he dove into Wikipedia, and after hours of research, he knew it was exactly what he wanted to write about.
“I was like, ‘This is the coolest thing ever. Why have I never learned about it? Why does no one I know know about it?’” Rustami said.
With a little bit of a calling mixed in with deadline pressure, he wrote the first draft in three hours. The script, Hassan said, went through “20 to 30” rewrites and continued to change all the way up to post-production.
Hassan wanted to pair up with Rustami immediately. He was initially worried that he wouldn’t be able to relate to any of the scripts that he was required to choose from. Then, at the bottom of the list, he saw “Sultanta.” 
“I read the script and I was like, okay, this is a crazy script,” he said. “But also it was a script I could make.”
Their next step was to look for a producer. There were no Muslim producers in their cohort, so instead they searched for someone who was dedicated to the story. They were lucky enough to find Charlie McCollum. From trying biriyani kabobs to visiting the local mosque, he fully devoted himself to learning about the culture.
“I was just lucky to be a part of a team that was willing to answer [my questions] and had full faith in me to help their vision for this story get told,” McCollum said. “It’s been great to just see the story take off. It’s bigger than us … it’s definitely bigger than me.”
Pieces of South Asian and Islamic culture are weaved throughout the short film, including Islamic verses, cultural clothing and scenes where characters speak Urdu. But creating a period piece — a film not set in modern times — was no easy feat. The group realized the boundaries of their vision when critics met them with skepticism. 
“It was so amazing and such an eye opening experience,” said Rustami  in regards to being chosen as a thesis film and receiving support. “But with that came a lot of downsides, too, in that a lot of people kind of were doubting us, who were calling the project very ambitious, and we were just held to a much higher scrutiny because no one had ever seen anything like it before.”
But this has only motivated the team to push forward. While the film includes representation, their mission is to properly portray the universal human experience and to create a film that teaches its audience as much as it gives them something to relate to. To McCollum, letting the story reach others is the most important part.
“The power of films in general is making people more interested in a subject they wouldn’t be able to experience on their own,” McCollum said.
“By the end of it, we’re going to be able to get the vision across,” Hassan said. Then he smiled: “Yeah, that’s the most exciting thing about it.”

Walkout or drop out!
East Los Angeles is composed of the largest Chicano population in the nation. In the late 1960s, Chicano students from schools on the East side of Los Angeles made up nearly 75% of the student population. These local institutions served the Mexican barrios — the Mexican portions of town — of L.A. Still, Chicano students faced academic inequity, resulting in an estimated 60% dropout rate among Mexican Americans. Even for those who graduated, the reading level within the community was as low as an eighth grade level. 
In addition, these institutions could have only one counselor for a student body of roughly 4,000, depending on the school. Students complained they were being steered toward vocational and domestic training rather than pushed for academics and college preparation. Some schools even prohibited speaking Spanish on school grounds. The prohibition of speaking Spanish in the classrooms took this expression away from students and dismissed their language. It was reported that if students were caught speaking Spanish, they would be spanked. 
Chicanos demanded that their language, history, and culture not be dismissed but reflected in their schools’ curricula. At the beginning of March 1968, Chicano students could either walk out and demand change within the district or watch the walkouts occur — known as the East L.A. Walkouts or Chicano Blowouts. With the Chicano students being at a massive low in college representation, students demanded change. 
The question remains, how did over 15,000 students across seven high schools reach the point where no teachers or administration were aware of their planning and managed to do so simultaneously? 
Sal Castro was a Mexican American social studies teacher at Belmont High School, where he organized students to go on strike and take their demands to the school board. He recalls in one instant seeing a school bus pick up around 25 seniors to take them to the local city college for college credit; none were Mexican American. 
Castro began to notice further the lack of representation in education for Mexican Americans and the lack of college preparatory resources for the population. The student government at Belmont did not have any Chicanos holding a position. For this reason, Castro began to search for students interested in running for their student government; he also requested that students speak a little Spanish at the assembly. 
After this request was followed through with at the assembly, the school lashed out. Ultimately, the school-wide meeting ended once the selected student spoke Spanish. Castro was suspended from Belmont the next day and transferred to Lincoln High School. 
Transferring high schools was different from the ending Castro had in mind. Castro had gone to UCLA to discuss with the United Mexican American Students, who needed their help. From there, he started gathering students from different East Los Angeles high schools to teach them their history and useful college information, subsequently encouraging students to apply to UC schools. 
Students from Belmont High School, Theodore Roosevelt High School, James A. Garfield High School, Woodrow Wilson High School (now El Sereno Middle School) and Abraham Lincoln High School had planned their walkout with the help of Garfield High alumni Carlos Montes, a member of the Brown Berets — a Chicano organization modeled after the Black Panther Party created for combating police brutality, racism and education, job and housing equality. 
Montes was an East Los Angeles College student, and on the morning of the walk, he drove to Lincoln High School and banged on lockers to encourage students to walk out.
The East Los Angeles students were inspired by the simultaneously-occurring Civil Rights Movement. The marches and protests inspired students to take it to the school board. However, all 39 requests were rejected after the walkouts because of insufficient funds. Graduation rates did increase after the blowout. Schools began to integrate bilingual programs. Chicano Studies classes and majors were incorporated into the college curriculum. 
Spanish is no longer prohibited, and the history, culture, and language are being taught. The walkout is said to have had no immediate effect; it eventually influenced the demands for proper education for Chicanos and all Latines. In addition, Belmont High School integrated a middle school named Sal Castro — the educator fired from the same institution in 1967. 
An influential part of Chicano history, the walkouts represented a young group’s commitment to the Chicano identity, which continued to grow afterward. These walkouts expanded nationally — however, the fight is not over.

With Black History Month officially concluded, Women’s History Month is currently in full swing. As a Black woman, one may think that this time of year must be exceptionally empowering and enriching for me: two consecutive months centered around the histories of my identities.
However, it feels as though for each respective month I am forced to shed one experience in order to give proper “attention” to others. But rather than being heard, it feels like I’m too woman to be Black, too Black to be a woman. 
Pinpointing this specific experience has been in the works since the ‘70s with Black critical race theorists and feminists like Audre Lorde, Kimberlé Crenshaw and bell hooks. Thinkers were beginning to realize that the ascension of feminist dialogues and gender studies tended to only detail the experience of one demographic of women: upper-class white women. 
When conversations around womanness became increasingly academic, it became inaccessible to lower-class women of color. Furthermore, because of this and the discussion being centered around power in terms of a generic “women are not equal to men” framework, feminism quickly became — and at times still appears to be — a conversation reserved for the women with the most resources. 
Yes, privilege exists in oppressed groups. Sounds paradoxical, doesn’t it? 
Responsively, dialogues about women subordination became simplified, general and diluted with the intention of being able to include all women — think about surface-level white feminist initiatives like “free the nipple,” yoga obsessions and body hair positivity dominating women’s issues. But it does quite the opposite.
Instead, we get an essentialized definition of what it means to be a woman, which further marginalizes the experiences of women who have more pressing issues than how men react to their armpit hair. Those who do not and cannot fit into the outlined “feminist” standards because of other identifiers like race, class and sexuality are often ignored. 
My identity, however, is cumulative. It cannot be isolated. I am a Black woman; I cannot shed my womanness in the same sense that I cannot shed my Blackness. As Crenshaw coined, it is an example of intersectionality. Consequently, the way in which I navigate the world and the way the world navigates around me, is a result of both simultaneously. 
This, then, is precisely how misogynoir works: the subordinations and prejudices against Black women specifically. The term itself is still fresh, coined in 2010 by scholar and activist Moya Bailey, but its definition has been manifesting for centuries. 
One of the main outlines of misogynoir is that Black women tend to have a limited, set amount of containers they are expected to fit into, many of which have origins from slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
Some of the most recognizable stereotyped containers include the mammy figure: a matronly, submissive Black woman often depicted with a low education whose sole purpose is to be a caretaker like Hattie McDaniels’ role as Mammy from “Gone with the Wind.” 
Then there’s the Jezebel: a typically light skinned, promiscuous and sexual Black woman, often the mistress. Both Halle Berry and Dorothy Dandridge are notorious for taking these roles. Another popular, more modern typecast is the sassy, loud, often dark-skinned role, more often than not a side character. Think Dijonay from “The Proud Family,” or Brenda Meeks in the “Scary Movie” franchise. 
Growing up and seeing these as the sole depictions of Black women in the media I consumed was disheartening in a way that I could not yet articulate. It was not just sexism, nor racism with the stereotyping and typecasting — it was a combination of both to caricaturize Black women. 
Senior contributor of Forbes, Janice Gassam Asare details how the effects of misogynoir cause Black women to be ignored and further marginalized. 
“Black women and girls who share experiences of abuse, trauma, and assault are largely shunned, criticized and ignored,” Asare writes. “If those in positions of power and privilege are not shielded from misogynoir (read: Megan Thee Stallion), then what protections do Black women who are not in positions of power and privilege actually have?”
Though I can acknowledge that we are moving in the right direction with more accurate diversity in the media. More texts from Black women are being published, respected and overall being given more mindfulness when it comes to these issues. However, in general, we still have a long way to go before Black women are acknowledged, accepted and integrated holistically. 
It starts with listening. 
While I find myself often educating and detailing my experiences through my creative projects, it is not the job nor sole responsibility of the Black community to do so. Us existing is enough. Us speaking is enough. Listen.

Mindful gardening has allowed me to become more patient and kind. Mindful gardening is the process of being fully present mentally in the garden to bring about a greater connection with one’s mind, body and spirit. My garden is a sanctuary where I can rest and recharge my batteries, a place where I can connect with nature to cultivate a healthy mind while feeling at ease. Becoming familiar with mindfulness is exceptionally important because of its benefits regarding self-control, improved concentration and mental clarity, and the ability to relate to others and yourself with kindness, acceptance, and compassion. 
Soil is proven to improve one’s mood because the bacteria in the ground stimulate parts of the brain that produce serotonin, which helps us feel happier and calmer. Gardening is even better at reducing cortisol levels than reading a book. 
As college students, we may not always have access to a vast garden where we can grow various plants, fruits or vegetables. While it would be great to maximize a harvest, mindful gardening focuses more on intentionally slowing down. Acquiring a couple of house plants in pots, a small herb garden or one raised bed, depending on your space, is perfect for those craving peace and restoration. 
“Mindfulness is the quality of being present and fully engaging with whatever we’re doing at the moment — free from distraction or judgment, and aware of our thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them,” according to an article in Headspace, a mindfulness app. 
One way this could be done is by activating each of your five senses. I like to start with hearing and use this opportunity to note any sounds in my environment. I pay attention to simple things like cars passing by, neighbors talking or birds chirping in the trees. After a few minutes, I will begin cleaning up my plants by cutting dead leaves, leveling the soil and wiping down my terracotta pots. I then focus on my sense of smell by sniffing my herbs and flower plants while noting any earthy, sweet or savory notes.
Regarding sight, I will focus on a plant, look at the colors, and note its veins and leaf textures. I will also use this time to see if any pests have invaded. With regards to taste, this one depends on if you have any edible plants. I will often pick off a piece of leaf and slowly enjoy its flavor. All in all, the length of the process varies on how much time I have. I usually aim for 10-20 minutes three times a week. Every time I finish a session of mindful gardening, I find that my nervous system is much calmer than when I initially started. Excellent house plants include: 
Pothos Collection: 
There are fifteen species of Pothos worldwide, all of which make excellent houseplants for gardeners at all levels with their attractive vine and heart-shaped leaves. Whether you get a golden pothos or a marble queen pothos, any variation can be grown either in or out of soil or in water. This is done through the process of propagation. Propagating is when you cut off pieces of the plant at the node and put it in water. It eventually grows roots and then you can replant it and create more plants. 
Pothos plants require bright, indirect or low light. Furthermore, they are also natural air purifiers that remove harmful pollutants and gasses. Pothos makes a great beginner plant because it is low maintenance and forgiving.  They also grow very fast at approximately 12-18 inches every month so long as they are provided with the optimal conditions of temperature, watering and lighting. Since they grow this quickly, they make great plants to propagate so you can eventually create a lot of plants. 
Snake Plant:
This is a great beginner plant, known for being low-maintenance and can handle a relatively large amount of neglect. They make great indoor plants because they purify the air by removing formaldehyde, xylene and nitrogen oxides from the air. Interestingly, they also produce oxygen at night while taking in carbon dioxide, improving air quality. Looking at the plant’s symbolism, they are often associated with persistence and happiness and interestingly, when looking at Feng-Shui (an ancient practice of arranging pieces in the home to promote a more balanced and harmonious relationship with the natural world) has been used to symbolize good luck. Snake Plants do not require a lot of water, something to note about this plant is that the soil must dry out completely to prevent overwatering and, subsequently, root rot. They thrive with any light level varying from low to high. That being said they tend to grow quicker in bright light. Under ample conditions, they tend to grow up to 12 feet tall. 
Peace Lily: 
These gorgeous green, flowering plants are excellent for beginners since they can survive watering mistakes and will inform their owners when something is wrong. For example, when they need water or are not getting enough sunlight, they will droop — but within two hours of being watered or receiving more sunshine, they will perk up. These plants like to be watered about once a week and prefer soil that dries out slightly between waterings. In terms of sunlight, they prefer low to bright indirect sunlight, making them the perfect fit for brightening up a dark corner. This plant can grow between 1 to 4 feet tall and wide but has been known to grow up to 6 feet. These are excellent air purifiers since they neutralize toxic gasses such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde.
All in all, I hope you decide to practice mindful gardening in an effort to find more love and kindness in your life.

Senior guard Boogie Ellis smiled from ear-to-ear as he hoisted the sword of victory after USC just defeated their crosstown rivals, the then-ranked No. 8 UCLA Bruins in Januray, behind an at-the-time career-high 31 points from the San Diego native. Ellis also contributed 6 assists, 4 rebounds, a steal and a block: a stat-stuffing performance to propel the team to victory. Head Coach Andy Enfield put it best when he simply said: “When he gets it going, he’s really hard to guard,” in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.
It hasn’t been difficult to see that Ellis has been hard to guard all season long. He’s averaging career-highs in nearly every statistical category, as well as leading the Trojans in points per game. Ellis has scored 15 or more points in 20 different games so far this season. He is also second on the team in assists per game and steals per game. 
Ellis credited his successful season to his progressive mentality.
“I just believe in myself, trust in my work [and have] confidence in myself,” Ellis said. “I try to get better every year. I feel like I got better from my freshman year to sophomore year, junior year to senior year. I’m just all about getting better.”
It’s not hard to tell that redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan is happy to have such a talented player running point for him and his squad. 
“He’s great. He makes the right passes, he’s a great knockdown 3-point shooter, he keeps the tempo up and he makes really smart decisions,” Morgan said. “I love playing with him.”
Morgan, who is in his second year playing with Ellis, has seen firsthand the huge step Ellis has taken in his time with the Trojans and acknowledged his hard work. 
“One thing we’re all super proud of is that he’s been getting better and better,” Morgan said.
Although he’s been one of the Pac-12’s best players this season, college basketball hasn’t been an easy road for Ellis. Coming out of Mission Bay High School in San Diego, Ellis initially committed to Duke before decommitting and committing to Memphis. In his first season at Memphis, Ellis struggled to live up to his top-50 recruitment status, and ultimately found himself losing minutes. 
“Going into college was my first time really going through adversity as a top player in the country,” Ellis said. “High school was really easy, but getting to college was kind of tough, it took me a while to adjust.” 
And just like he said he would, Ellis trusted himself and improved — perhaps with help from a change of scenery. He officially transferred to USC in April 2021, and he’s stepped up in a big way since arriving in South Central. He showed flashes of his impressive skill set at Memphis, but as a Trojan, those flashes have become consistent and Ellis’ is putting his true capabilities on full display every time he steps onto the court.
Ellis has noticed the differences in the culture at USC compared to other programs he has been a part of. 
“It’s definitely a great place. It’s a family-oriented place,” Ellis said. “All the coaches want to see you win, they want to see you get better. They put you first and your game first, so I really respect that.”
With the recent signing of top-ranked guards for both the men’s and women’s teams and the recent success of transfer players such as Ellis, Drew Peterson and Joshua Morgan, it’s clear that the culture of USC basketball is something that many players want to be a part of and can succeed in.
 “Coach Andy [Enfield] is doing a great job with the culture here, and I would tell anybody that has the opportunity to come to USC that they should come here for sure,” Ellis said. 
Ellis is noticeably quiet and pensive, at least off the court. On the court, he has been touted as a vocal leader by his teammates, not to mention he’ll also break you down on defense and let you hear it after he drains a 30-foot three-pointer in your face. Freshman guard Oziyah Sellers has learned a lot from his veteran guard counterpart. 
“Being a freshman, early on coming in, he’s taught me a lot,” Sellers said. “He’s been a true leader this year for me, [and] he’s shown me how to be more of a leader.” 
Trojan fans should be very excited for their young, up-and-coming guards with the mentorship and guidance that they’re receiving from one of the nation’s most skilled guards.
USC basketball has been an underdog before and thrived under that title, reaching the Elite Eight in the 2021 NCAA Tournament as a No. 6 seed. It seems as if the team has proved itself to be dangerous at its fullest potential and Ellis has proved himself to be a legitimate NBA talent. However, Ellis told the L.A. Times “we still have more to prove.” 
The soft spoken senior once again kept it simple when talking about his goals for the rest of the season. 
“I don’t really have goals for myself. I really believe that if you win and you continue to do what you do, you’ll be rewarded [individually],.” Ellis said.
Ellis’ team-first and “work hard and you will be rewarded” mentalities have worked well, as both he and the team are trending upward. 
With a name as smooth as his game, it’s undeniable that the legend of Boogie Ellis will live on far past his years at USC. Wherever he ends up, it’s safe to say that Ellis will always have fans in L.A. Ellis cracked a smile as he said what wants to be remembered most for as a Trojan.
“Buckets. For sure,” he said.
Buckets will be greatly appreciated as the Trojans play behind their star guard in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals Thursday at 8:30 p.m. against the winner of Arizona State and Oregon State’s Wednesday night matchup.

Watching Trinity Rodman score goals is kind of like watching her dad’s famous clip from “The Last Dance” (2020), where he explains how he rebounded so proficiently. It’s just a series of onomatopoeia, but somehow it makes perfect sense. 
“Boom, uh. Click, go back this way. Boom, here, here. Click and go that way.”
Rodman receives the ball in some positions where you would never expect her to score, but she does anyway.
And yes, in case you were still wondering, Trinity Rodman’s father is Dennis Rodman, the five-time NBA champion who became a cult hero for the Chicago Bulls during their second three-peat of the ‘90s. 
The athletic talent clearly passed from father to daughter. Rodman has developed the pure ball-striking prowess and electric dribbling that sometimes just can’t be taught — it’s innate.
Rodman had such prodigious talent that she never even had to play a match in college before the NWSL’s Washington Spirit drafted her with the second overall pick in 2021. Rodman had committed to play for the Washington State Cougars but her freshman season was canceled due to the pandemic.
In her debut season, at just 18 years old, Rodman scored 6 goals and provided 5 assists in 22 matches, helping the Spirit win the NWSL title. She even scored the second goal of their semifinal match against the OL Reign.
After her rookie year, the Spirit were so assured of her talent that they gave her a four-year, $1.1 million contract that reportedly made her the league’s highest-paid player. 
The Spirit struggled to defend their title in 2022, placing second to last in the league. Naturally, Rodman’s numbers dropped off, but her talent isn’t up for debate. Rodman is a dribbling machine who can kickstart attacks all on her own. 
Do yourself a favor and look up some of her highlights. One thing you should immediately notice is how comfortable she looks with the ball at her feet. When Rodman has possession, the defense should be terrified. She has an arsenal of moves, from little flicks and turns to more overt displays of confidence like the Cristiano Ronaldo chop move — where a player looks fully committed to running one way before cutting hard in the opposite direction.
Even though Rodman and the Spirit didn’t play well in 2022, the numbers still back up her dribbling ability. Per FBref, in the last year, she averaged 5.03 progressive carries per 90 minutes. Progressive carries measure the number of times a player receives the ball and dribbles it at least 10 yards closer to the opponent’s goal, as long as the sequence ends in the attacking half. That ranks in the 89th percentile among players in the top eight women’s soccer leagues. She also has 1.92 successful take-ons per 90 minutes, meaning she dribbles past almost two players per game. 
Despite her team struggling offensively in 2022 — the Spirit only scored 26 goals in 22 games — Rodman worked hard defensively. She averaged over 2.5 tackles, 1.5 interceptions and 2.21 blocks per match, all of which ranked in the 93rd percentile or better among players who play a similar position to Rodman. Her commitment to the defensive side of the game shows a team-oriented mentality and a grittiness that her dad would surely appreciate. 
Looking forward to the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup and beyond, Rodman will play a huge role in future USWNT squads. Alongside the Portland Thorns FC’s Sophia Smith and the Chicago Red Stars’ Mallory Swanson, the United States Women’s National Team has a trio of dynamic, positionally-flexible young attackers with speed and technique to match it.
Rodman made her USWNT debut at the 2022 SheBelieves Cup and has since made 15 appearances, scoring 2 goals and adding 3 assists for USWNT. She is in the running for a roster spot for the World Cup in New Zealand and Australia and given her age, she could lock down her place for a decade or more. 
Rodman also has admirable off-the-field interests. In partnership with her sponsor Adidas, she authored a children’s book called “Wake Up and Kick It.” Rodman hopes it will encourage kids to be ambitious with their dreams.
“I’m excited for this book to inspire the next generation to go out and achieve their goals and dreams, proving that nothing is out of reach if you are willing to work for it,” Rodman said in an interview with Adidas.
Rodman has the talent and mindset to dominate the NWSL and women’s soccer for years to come.
