Throughout the summer USC Facility Management Services finished 51 construction projects, ranging from office renovations to utility updates. Twenty-two of them were labeled “capital construction projects.”
Fenced off · More than 51 construction projects were completed over the course of the summer. The fences along Child’s Way will remain up until the project is completed, at the end of August. Finished projects include the renovation of 31 classrooms on campus. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
As planned, the only summer construction project that will not be completed by the start of classes is the underground utility replacement and paving of Child’s Way. The project is expected to be completed by the end of August, said Joe Back, associate senior vice president of Campus Development and Facilities Management.
Consequently, the red fencing on Child’s Way between Hahn Plaza and Pardee Plaza will remain until the completion of the Child’s Way project at the end of August. The project will replace sewage lines underneath the street.
As part of a four-year plan to upgrade all classrooms on campus, 31 classrooms this summer received a technological upgrade, including LCD projectors and display panels as well as updated audio-visual features. New walls and carpet were also added to improve acoustics in the classrooms.
Other projects this summer included the replacement of ceiling tiles throughout the Lyon Center, which resulted in its temporary shutdown from Aug. 2 to Aug. 4; an upgrade of the steam system at the Education Library and major renovations in the Seeley G. Mudd Hall Auditorium, the Social Science Building’s basement, the Von KleinSmid Center’s east wing and Waite Phillips Hall.
Other long-term capital construction projects are on schedule for completion, Back said.
This includes the new Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann Student Health Center, scheduled to be completed by fall 2012; the John McKay Center, which should be ready to house athletic offices by Summer 2012; the Brain and Creativity Institute, which is also slated for completion in Summer 2012; and the University Club at Stoops Hall, which should be finished by April or May 2012.

Two alleged gang members were sentenced
Aug. 11 in the non-fatal shooting of USC track star Bryshon Nellum.
Travon Reed of Los Angeles and Horasio Kimbrough of Inglewood were sentenced to 15 years each for the shooting, which occurred outside of Leonardo’s Club and Restaurant on Vermont Avenue and 28th Street. Both pleaded no contest to attempted murder.
Nellum, 19 at the time of the shooting, was walking out of Leonardo’s Club and Restaurant, where he had attended a Halloween party, when he was shot in both thighs and one hamstring.
According to prosecutors, Reed and Kimbrough mistook Nellum for a rival gang member.
Throughout the course of the trial, Nellum’s family and lawyers maintained he was not involved in any gang related activities and had no known enemies.
At the time of the shooting Nellum was the fastest 19-and-under 400-meter sprinter in the world, USC’s Director of track and field, Ron Allice, said.
Prior to attending USC, Nellum, a 2007 graduate of Long Beach Polytechnic High School, held the nationwide high school record for the 200- and 400-meter sprints. Nellum was also named Gatorade National Boys Track and Field Athlete of the Year for the 2006-2007 academic year.
Nellum was the first athlete ever to win two California state titles two straight years in the 200- and 400-meter race.
Following the shooting, Nellum underwent surgery at California Hospital Medical Center and physical therapy.
Nellum later returned as a sprinter on the track and field team.
15 years for attempted murder is a joke. This is a shame, an innocent student gets shot and the thugs plead no contest to attempted murder. Attempted Murder! the failed attempt to KILL a person!!!!! 
Give these thugs 50 years!
It’s stories like this one that call out for maximum sentencing with no plea deals……personally, I’d like to see these guys executed in public….which would happen if this happened in a Muslim theocracy.
Only 15 years!!!?

The USC Graduate School moved into its new offices Aug. 11 after two months of renovations during the summer.
The renovation aimed to manipulate office space to better accommodate graduate school staff and provide better services for students,Vice Provost for Planning and Budget, Robert Cooper, said.
Office space · The USC Graduate School moved into its newly renovated office in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall 315 on Aug. 11. During the summer, the office was temporarily located in The Lot. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The creation of more alcoves and the relocation of the office’s entrance will contribute to a quieter atmosphere in the office, Cooper said.
“[It will] provide a quiet workspace for staff and graduate students who work in the office,” Cooper said.
Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management, also said that the office’s new layout provides for a more efficient work environment.
“The office layout was revised to create more offices and a conference room was added,” Back said. “The entry location was changed to be more convenient. The remodeled area also got new carpet and paint.”
Funding for the project, which began in June, came from the general fund, Cooper said.
Because of the renovations, the Graduate School moved to The Lot — a temporary structure built as a food court during construction of the campus center in 2008 — during the week of June 13.
During the office’s temporary move, there was no reduction in services for graduate students, Cooper said. The graduate school office re-opened at its permanent location, Grace Ford Salvatori Hall 315, on Aug. 11.
The Lot will now be used as “surge space” until summer 2012, Back said.
“Surge space is space that is generally not assigned on a permanent basis and is available for temporary assignment in order to perform renovation or maintenance work in [a] permanent location,” Back said.
Cooper said the university plans to remove The Lot next summer.
“Next summer, at the same time that the new addition to Seeley G. Mudd is done, [The Lot] will be taken down,” Cooper said.
The addition will house the new Brain and Creativity Institute, which is already under construction.

For most students, the days and weeks before move-in day of freshman year are filled with a mix of anxiety and excitement, as they prepare to leave home, usually for the first time — and begin a new period of their life. And when that trip to college includes a flight halfway around the world that will end in a place and culture totally foreign, the experience can be especially daunting.
For Vignesh Balasubramanian, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, the process was daunting even before he boarded his 20-hour flight from India to Los Angeles. After Balasubramanian was accepted to USC, he had to interview with an immigration officer and prove he would be able to finance his education just to be granted a visa.
“[The process] was very uncertain,” Balasubramanian said. “It’s just very cumbersome. There’s a lot of paper work and there are always a ton of questions. It’s just very tedious. It’s a pain.”

That’s just the start of the uncertainty for many international students, a number of whom are the first in their families to study in the United States. Nationally and at USC, the number of international students has grown significantly in the past 20 years.
“I had this notion that … I wanted to come to some place different,” Balasubramanian said. “The best place to be is in the U.S. for cutting edge science and technology.”
So, for the sake of his education, Balasubramanian, like many others, left home and ventured to Los Angeles.
“There was definitely cultural shock,” he said. “The way people speak is very different. We’re not as loud and outgoing as Americans are. I did miss things about my culture.”
Balasubramanian said it took him a few weeks to get used to the way people speak, but he feels that was his only real challenge in adjusting to life in another country and culture.
For students who might have more trouble with the task, student groups play a large role in helping to ease the adjustment.
Shiven Gandhi former president of the Association of Indian Students — which is one of the most highly represented countries at USC — helps acclimate to Los Angeles and to college life.
AIS provides Indian students with help finding housing, understanding fundamental California law, opening a bank account and other necessities, and creates a community for those who might feel strange in their new country.
AIS also offers accommodation services, which place students into a house for a few days at no cost while they look for another place to stay. Last year, Gandhi said, AIS placed 180 students with volunteer hosts.
“For most of the students it’s their first time leaving their parents and first time moving out and staying alone, so with these services they are more accustomed to the U.S. culture and how to become adjusted to the education system,” Gandhi said.
AIS also celebrates many of the festivals that take place in India, to help students feel more at home and to stay in touch with their own culture.
The Office of International Services offers help to international students, and Tony Tambascia, director of OIS, said other programs like the American Language Institute and academic units and administrative departments on campus also do their part to ensure international students thrive.
“Given that many international students are quite far from home, and are often living in the U.S. for the first time, it’s understandable that it might take a little time to adjust to being in a new environment,” Tambascia wrote in an email. “The good news is there are many resources at USC to help students … We are here to do all we can to help international students to be successful and make the most of their time at USC.”
As for Balasubramanian, he said it took some getting used to, but he’s now accustomed to his new American way of life.
“The best way to deal with it is acceptance,” he said. “That was the way I dealt with it, got used to it and accepted the fact that it’s not going to be the same.”

USC offers its ever-growing international student population of non-native English speakers resources and learning opportunities to boost their English fluency and prepare them for a top-tier university education in the United States.
The American Language Institute at the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences provides a range of English language classes, testing services and training opportunities.
Operating independently of other linguistics and languages programs within USC Dornsife, ALI provides services catered toward non-native English speakers.
Design by Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
According to Jim Valentine, director of ALI, the institute focuses largely on improving oral and written English skills.
“I would say writing and oral skills, a half-and-half division, are the largest issues for [non-native English speakers],” Valentine said.
Valentine notes, however, incoming international students’ English-speaking skills are improving.
“We’re seeing better levels of preparation, and in general, quite impressive levels of fluency,” he said.
For students who need more assistance with speaking English and perform poorly on the International Student English Exam, ALI offers courses that fulfill USC English language requirements. ALI classes are also availible to all USC students who want to improve their English language skills.
Unique initiatives such as the ALI’s International Teaching Assistant program offer non-native English speaking teaching assistants, through collaboration with undergraduate students, the opportunity to improve their English skills and get acquainted with American culture.
Graduate students who want to become ITAs are paired with native English-speaking undergraduate student consultants from diverse backgrounds.
“We mainly focus on public speaking and also how to communicate with undergraduate students,” said Tony Hsieh, a senior double majoring in music and cinema production and a former undergraduate student consultant. “One part is teaching them how to lecture and give them confidence and the other is to show them student life.”
Through weekly interactions, the student consultants are able to pass on linguistic knowledge and cultural awareness to their older peers.
“We take them out to restaurants, go to movies with other ITAs, etc.,” Hsieh said. “It’s important for them to know how to connect with undergraduate students that they’ll be teaching.”
Woojoo Lee, an ITA from Korea, has found the program beneficial.
“It’s always hard to teach in English, [the ITA program] gives us a chance to speak in and practice English,” Lee said. “Usually we have casual conversation, and sometimes I give him some class materials and he corrects my pronunciation.”
The program also reciprocally provides value to the undergraduates who work with future ITAs.
“Our [ITA] program creates one-on-one situations where
undergrads benefit not only from teaching, but can also learn about the TA’s culture,” said Valentine. “It’s a really exciting program.”

Eleven percent of USC’s incoming class of 2015 is international students, a 1 percent increase from the class of 2014, making USC’s student body one of the most diverse in the country.
USC Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold attributes the growing international student population to an increase in financial resources and the implementation of new recruiting practices.
“USC has always had international admissions officers,” Brunold said, “but in the past six to seven years we really started to hold more [SCend offs] and attend more college fairs overseas.”
USC has also made an effort in the last few years to station recruiters across the globe who are culturally sensitive to the country they are working in,  Brunold said.
The focus of international recruitment efforts is currently in East Asia, but India is next.  Brunold said USC is currently searching for a new officer of admissions to bridge the gap between America and India, one of the most populous countries in the world.
Despite an increase in resources, the international student recruitment process is largely the same as that for prospective American students.
“The fact that they are international students doesn’t affect the traditional recruitment process,” Brunold said. “The strategy abroad does not significantly change for international students compared to domestic students — they have the same needs.”
Just like any American high school, USC sends admission officers abroad to visit high schools, present in seminars and appear in college fairs. In China alone, USC admissions representatives visited more than 80 high schools during the 2010-2011 academic year.
Interviews, although not required, are conducted in person overseas except in situations where prospective international students are unable to travel to regional admissions representatives.
Brunold said modern methods of communication like Skype have been used to conduct interviews, but he contends that face-to-face interviews are more effective.
“Human involvement adds value to the process,” Brunold said.
Though the Internet has altered the way in which universities are able to reach out to prospective international students, many international students at USC, including Seokyoon Nam, a freshman majoring in philosophy, made their college decision based on recommendations from friends.
“The Internet did not play too much [of a] role in my application,” Nam said. “I decided to apply to USC because of some [of my] friends who were attending USC recommended it to me … and my research was done mostly through phone calls to my friends.”
One fundamental difference between international student admissions and domestic student admissions is that need-based aid is not available for international students.
“Applicants may get confused because, while USC is need-blind in the admissions process, international students must provide proof of financial support [when they apply],” Brunold said.
This is because for international students to attend school in the United States they are required to complete an I-20 form, which affirms that a student can financially support himself or herself for the upcoming academic year. If a student fails to meet the requirements of the I-20, he or she will not be permitted to enter the country.
Some merit-based scholarships are, however, available for international students.

Interfraternity Council leadership reminded presidents during their annual retreat that last year’s social prohibition on The Row still stands, IFC President Pat Lauer said.
Party off · The social prohibition placed on Interfraternity Council member fraternities remains from a string of events in 2010-2011. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Lauer reminded presidents of the ban at their retreat Aug. 6 and Aug. 7.
“We heard from the administration that if there were any incidents like there were last year it would jeopardize having recruitment altogether,” Lauer said. “We all decided that we didn’t want that to happen.”
What the university community has generally called “Pre-Rush” parties, which take place before recruitment, are not allowed this semester because they take place on weekday nights, prohibited by the current ban.
Lauer said no exact date had been set to lift the ban, nor had specific provisions for lifting the ban been set. He said he heard that the ban would be lifted around the first week of September.
“We’re still working with the vice president’s office to see what we have to do on our part to ensure that social events are safe,” Lauer said. “We want to start the first weeks off with no alcoholic incidents.”
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson placed The Row on social prohibition in April for the second time during the 2010-2011 school year after several negative events took place within the Greek community.
Last year, a misogynistic email sent on the Kappa Sigma fraternity listserv and photos of a suspended Kappa Sigma appearing to have sex on a USC rooftop spread virally.
The Row was first shut down Aug. 30, after 16 IFC chapters were cited for prohibited parties. Eight students were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.
The ban was lifted two weeks later after all 16 fraternities met with the Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards committee and agreed to enforce rules that had been violated that Monday.
Fraternities agreed not to let alcoholic beverages outside the house, have large groups of people congregate or play loud music. Sorority presidents signed a letter about preventing irresponsible drinking.
DChi you knowww
Am I understanding this correctly? The “Row” has always been and remains all about alcohol consumption? I’m a third generation Trojan alumnus, and no stranger to alcohol; yet, I thought our alma mater was all about education not inebriation. Then again, 28th Street has never been and is not now part of University Park, technically nor sociologically speaking.
Back when I was on the Row (’48 to ’52) chasing skirts, we had lots of men who came back from WWII and Korea on the GI Bill.  They knew how to drink and didn’t need an ambulance or ride to the hospital after couple of beers like today’s kids.   If you didn’t know how to drink, those older experienced guys sat you down and taught you how to drink without making a mess of yourself.   We took care of our own and led the university unlike today where the university leads the Row.  Sad to see today’s Greek generation can do anything right!
 Who raised this current group of pansies?  Oh yeah, those wacky free-love 60s and 70s dirt-bags…
I have fond memories of my time at SC and on the Row in my fraternity who I shall not name here.  We were gentlemen drinkers who served our country and knew our limits and took care of fraternity and the younger members who had not see action in War as I did.   It’s true we GI Boys knew how to drink and shared that knowledge with the younger members.  Often a bottle was purchased of whiskey, bourbon or sometimes gin just for the purposes of training the pledges on the proper way to consume and enjoy adult beverages.   There were no drugs around (except the Mexican gardeners that moved the lawns on campus smoked marijuana occasionally) so we did not worry about people mixing things like today.  Pledges were given a small glass and drank without ice cubes or mixers as only sissy boys drank fancy mixed drinks.   We were men and no one wanted to be considered a sissy in those days.  Seems everyone is a sissy today.
As a student who was also on the row during my 4 years, I can tell you that the people getting taken to the hospital were predominantly underage freshman girls who were not “taught how to drink” by parents or “older experienced guys,” unless they were clearly being taken advantage of. However, I do agree that our country has been raising a bunch of wusses who have been rewarded for losing their entire lives so that their feelings don’t get hurt. But in this case, it’s a pretty irrelevant argument. I can’t really blame anyone for not teaching their daughters how to properly binge drink before college. The only person to blame when a girl needs to be taken to the hospital for alcohol reasons is the girl and the friends she’s with. You can’t drink heavily without being smart about it.
You also can’t blame today’s Greek generation for not being able to do anything right, blame the PC society that we live in now. They’re doing everything they’ve been doing for decades, it’s just that university presidents and whatnot need to get off their high horses and stop acting like the Row doesn’t exist predominantly to party. They either need to accept it or get rid of it. Pussyfooting around clearly isn’t working. And since I’m guessing a large amount of money is coming from alumni who were Greek, there’s no way they could afford to get rid of it.
Excellent points ’11.   However you failed to mention the “sissification” of the beverages served to these binge drinkers.   All the sweet mixers high in carbs hide the true flavor of the beverage from the “transport”.   Maybe if they could taste the alcohol, they wouldn’t over consume and we would all be better off.  Before you start talking about closing the row, I would start by banning mixers and any sugary frozen drinks used to hide the alcohol from the under experienced drinker.
These rules may apply to all the other fraternities at USC, but Sigma Chi lives by its own rules.  We will have social, because social is what we are all about.  If people can’t handle alcohol its not our fault, they need to learn how to drink.
I’m sure your president is thrilled by your public comment.
Nothing more to say!

Although USC boasts a vibrant Greek community, only a small portion of the Greek system is comprised of international students.
Of the 1,833 undergraduate international students at USC, only 105 were involved in the Greek system last year, according to Beth Saul, assistant dean of student affairs and director for Office of Fraternity and Sorority Leadership and Parent Programs.
Overall more than 2,600 out of the nearly 17,000 undergraduate students at USC were involved in Greek life last year.
Design by Kathryn Mock | Daily Trojan
An international student at USC is therefore three times less likely to join a fraternity or sorority at USC than an American student.
“We are making efforts to reach out to international students that want to go Greek,” Saul said.
Although the number of international students involved in Greek life is proportionately small, Saul notes the number of international students joining the Greek system at USC is increasing yearly.
Compared to the 2008-2009 academic year, the number of international students involved in Greek life rose 7 percent during the 2010-2011 academic year, according to Saul.
The Greek community has made a concerted effort in the past few years to reach out to international students especially during international student orientation.
“We had a Greek life info session during international orientation session last year and it was very successful, so we decided to have one again this year,”
Saul said.
Some students, however, including Alexander Silkin, a junior from Russia majoring in computer science and a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, found the Greek life session during international student orientation discouraging.
“For international students, at one time during orientation there was a one-hour seminar and I just decided to go to the Greek seminar,” Silkin said. “It wasn’t particularly helpful, so I think that really turns people off.”
Raymond Carlos, the associate director of the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership, notes the low number of international students involved in Greek life can be attributed to people’s association with the word “Greek.”
“The fact that we call it Greek life may just sound different to other people,” Carlos said. “People may not be familiar with what we mean by Greek.”
Silkin, who lived for several years in Hong Kong, concurs with this analysis, noting that the Greek system is a foreign concept for many Asians.
“Even though I basically lived in Hong Kong, even though it’s Asia, it’s very western so it wasn’t hard for me to adjust, but I think people coming straight from Asia would find it hard to fit [into the Greek system],” Silkin said.
As an American citizen who grew up  in London, Christopher McMahon, a junior majoring in business and cinematic arts, understands how international students are not culturally aware of Greek life.
“I can see why there isn’t much of an international population, just because it’s a strange concept,” McMahon said. “There really isn’t a good way to understand what [fraternities and sororities] are if you’re not brought up knowing what they are.”
McMahon said he believes the best way to increase the international population in the Greek system is through word of mouth.
“Once you get more [international students] into the system, they start talking to their friends and other peers that are overseas, then you get that rollover effect, that initial push,” McMahon said.

What exactly is “underrepresented”?  The percentages don’t match up between the Greek community and the general USC community.  OK, so what?  That’s how the world works.  Pick two groups of people, compare them with some criteria, analyze the differences.  Doesn’t mean anything.  CORRELATION DOESN”T EQUAL CAUSATION.
Foreign students are foreign, thus have no idea of what Greek life even is, as noted in the article.
Keep on slandering the Greek community, Daily Trojan!  Sorry Greek life isn’t for you, but stop trying to impose your viewpoints on everyone else.  Thanks.
ATO took a whole bunch of Euro trash last year only to have them leave after one year.
What’s “Euro trash?” please define it.
A human sub-phylum characterized by its apparent affluence, worldliness, social affectation and addiction to fashion. Males are characterized by a semi-slovenly appearance (including half-shaven faces), greasy hair, rib-hugging shirts, tight jeans and loafers worn without socks. Women are easily distinguished by anorexia, over-bleached hair, gaudy jewelry, plastic surgery (particularly breast-enlargement) and their attachment to the male species. Both sexes greet each other with “air kisses,” immediately speak of their last trip (often Paris, Rome, Majorca), spend hours at “see-and-be-seen” restaurants and exhibit a world-weariness and pained sense of iron
Or Simply find yourself a mirror
That kind of attitude is what discourages many people from joining the Greek system (both American and international). Greek life is a way for Americans to continue their American high school experience, full of drama and pointless popularity contests, something many international kids either did not experience before or would not want to repeat again.

USC has enrolled more international students than any other U.S. university since 2001, and this year’s freshman class is the most international in the school’s history.
The trend in part represents a growing worldwide interest in U.S. higher education — in 2009 international students made up 3.6 percent of all U.S. college students, up from 2.9 percent in 1989 — and in part is the result of USC’s intense focus on becoming a global university.
That focus began with former President Steven B. Sample, who strove to make USC a strong presence in the Pacific Rim and helped form the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. Sample believed having a strong international population on campus could improve the experience for both international and domestic students by bringing different cultures, strengths and viewpoints together. That vision has continued under President C. L. Max Nikias.
USC is not alone in its quest to become a more global university, but as the numbers show, it has so far been the most successful. Anthony Bailey, associate provost for global initiatives, attributes this to USC’s generally high place in the rankings, like those done by U.S. News & World Report, the availability of professional programs, and USC’s location in the heart of Los Angeles.
Bailey specifically points to the Marshall School of Business and the Viterbi School of Engineering as academic units that draw a lot of international students. According to the Institute of International Education, the most popular fields of study for international students are business and engineering, and not all universities offer undergraduate business or engineering majors.
Pei-Hsuan Chu, director of USC’s Taiwan office, added that reputation and the strong alumni network also influence students’ desire to come to USC.
USC has also taken a fairly original approach to growing its international presence. The university currently has six international offices — in China, India, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan and Hong Kong— that work to develop academic and research partnerships abroad and interact with current and prospective students from those countries. Bailey said although many universities have learning centers in other countries to support students studying abroad, USC is one of few universities with such robust offices around the globe.
The international offices support the efforts of the Admissions Office — which has three full-time officers who recruit internationally — and the graduate schools in recruiting students and helping them learn more about the university. The offices can also help allay the concerns of international students, which typically center on safety and the cost of tuition, as international students are not eligible for need-based financial aid.
More critically, however, they help USC develop strong ties around the world, which leads to the continued growth in the international population at USC.
“I don’t think the school is saying we want to bring in more international students, it’s that USC has strong roots around the world, in Asia in particular,” Bailey said.
As the number of international students grows, some in the education community have raised concerns that many international students do not stay — the criticism is that students are coming to the United States to get an education, but then not using their education to benefit the country.
“Most of the graduates from Korea return to Korea,” said Steven Lee, director of USC’s South Korea office. “Career opportunities for these graduates are much better in Korea.”
Representatives from the Taiwan and Hong Kong offices echoed this sentiment, saying that especially in recent years, more graduates are returning home to find work. The tough U.S. job market is in part to blame, as well as the complicated process of getting a work visa to stay in the country.
Roy Choi, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, said he hopes to stay in the United States but noted that it could be complicated by paperwork.
Even if international graduates do leave the United States, Bailey said he does not think this is a problem. The goal, he noted, is not just to benefit the United States economically but to support a “cross-pollination of perspectives.”
“International students benefit us even when they go home because they’re the ones who help provide global ties and understanding and promote global peace,” Bailey said.
USC hopes to continue its quest toward globalization, both by bringing international students to campus and by growing the university’s presence abroad. There are currently plans to open an office in Brazil, and there is talk of offices in Singapore and Beijing, Bailey said. He added that administrators are also discussing the idea of a “global campus,” though the notion has yet to take a concrete form.

It was frustrating to read this article and have no facts or figures cited to back up the assertions.  How many/what percent of this year’s class are international students?  What is USC’s US News and World Report’s ranking?  Without the facts it’s hard to give the assertions made any credibility.

It is a widely accepted fact that USC has one of the most ethnically diverse student bodies because of high recruitment of international students.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
USC has the most international students of any university in the country. These students allow the rest of the student body to be welcomed into a world of different cultures in an equally diverse city. The experience of being a student in such a melting pot of an institution is more than eye-opening.
In a nutshell, the benefits of internationalism outweigh the costs.
Yet, the perception that many international students seem to be tucked away in Parkside International Residential College is an unfortunate truth.
International students are left to integrate themselves into the community without much help from the administration. The university must set up cultural, academic and social programs aimed to integrate the domestic and international communities.
Although this kind of forced integration and interaction can oftentimes prove counterproductive to integration, it just might be what’s best for international students.
Parkside can quickly become a comfort zone for students who might feel overwhelmed by moving to a new country — students are often placed in apartments with those with whom they share similar interests.
International culture often flourishes at Parkside, but unfortunately does not include students who could benefit from experiencing the truly diverse student population at USC.
The argument that Parkside is a bubble is flawed as it could be that there is no bubble whatsoever — perhaps students simply aren’t interested
in integrating.
It seems as if the rest of the student body is content to let international students flourish in the southwest corner of campus.
It’s time that more students mingle with each other while still placing an emphasis on making international students feel comfortable and at home.
To promote cross-cultural mingling, Parkside should be more open to the rest of the student body. Parkside functions as a great community for international students to be surrounded by people who are going through similar experiences — being in a new country, on studying in a language that they might not be as comfortable with.
But the Parkside residences should make more of an effort as well by hosting more visible events on that corner of campus. Parkside puts on a variety of popular events, including the International House of Fashion, but why stop there?
Another avenue for fully integrating international students into USC culture would be to create a club that seeks to bridge the cultural disparities between the growing international presence and domestic Trojans.
Orientation sessions do not suffice, considering there is are separate sessions for international students.
Rather than this division, actively bringing international students and newly accepted students together can be a positive way to promote conversation.
Furthermore, the most important questions regarding international students are: What do they want? Do they feel as if they are being left out? And if so, what can we do to change that?
We can’t hope to know unless we do more to open the lines of conversation among the entirety of the student population.
Conversation is the most productive way in which to accommodate all students, and the university and the student body need to begin placing a heavier emphasis on tying together the various cultures at USC. Hosting open forums — sanctioned by USG — in Bovard Auditorium, would be a good start.
There are always more opportunities than we realize to understand the various cultures brought to USC’s campus, but it requires some work.
Perhaps events that showcase the cultures represented in Parkside would be a start toward gaining more understanding of the students that make up our student body, or even events that give a more nuanced understanding of American culture.
We need compromise and representation from both sides, for the benefits of doing so would lead to a greater understanding of the world, both within and outside the walls of USC campus.
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English literature. 
This past Saturday, three friends, former colleagues, and sister Trojans reunited: two born in Korea, one born in China and one born in SF.  We became friends at USC, and have shared our lives off and on for the past 40 years.  I have learned so much from these women, and how to support others through tough times.
I highly encourage students to look around and make new friends.  Learn and grow with each other; remain friends for a lifetime.  My life has been enriched by former Trojans from the U.S., Sri Lanka, China, India and Korea.  This time of one’s life is for exploration and experiences, and thus finding ways to mix and mingle makes so much sense.
Very well put . this article is great in fact I am going through hard time trying to convivne my son to Stay at USC he wants to go back to India He does not like the fact that he is isolated at Parkside building he wants to interact with the other student . not only international students. He wants to learn the way other local students think and have fun. please do something for this nonsence of isolating INTERNATIONAL sstudents to stop. thanks Mellissa.

In recent years, USC has made monumental accomplishments and, as a result, has risen in multiple rankings.
During the precipitous rise, USC has also seen its profile grow internationally. The international population at USC has never been larger, and foreign recruitment is among the university’s top priorities.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Though the presence of international students on campus enriches the student experience, the individualism of the international students is oftentimes lost, leaving them to become isolated while being lumped together by the university.
Before visiting USC’s campus for the first time the international composition of the student body did not seem to be a factor in deciding which college I would go to.
The variety of cultures and nations represented around campus, however, was immediately impressive. In short, there is a very international feel to the campus, and the value of being in such a diverse environment was apparent.
That being said, USC’s constant focus on international students runs the risk of distracting from students’ accomplishments.
In pushing for a student body composed of more foreign students, less focus could be placed on an admitted student’s qualifications and more on what country appears under the citizenship section in their official documentation. Though the latter is
important, actual achievements should be given more attention than should something that is beyond students’ control: their birthplace.
Once international students come to USC, however, it seems that many can become isolated and almost forgotten by the rest of the student body.
Parkside International Residential College can seem like its own country at times with its location in a corner of campus that is far from where many social activities take place, like McCarthy Quad and The Row.
The name International Residence College can also cause concerns among the rest of the student body, who might feel the hall is mostly international. This only serves to defeat the purpose of an increasing international presence at our school.
Instead of encouraging assimilation and cross-cultural friendships, Parkside IRC’s set up attracts more foreigners by showing them an internationally tailored side of campus.
This could potentially make it somewhat more difficult for students to make more friends, both international and domestic, in those crucial first weeks of school.
After zealously recruiting international students to gain recognition and prestige, more focus should be placed on these students before they become just another number in USC’s demographic reports.
Though USC has an uncanny ability to make prospective international students feel welcome, we need to do more to promote intercultural interaction among foreign students who do commit.
A university is supposed to expand people’s minds and give them a more tolerant, educated world view; furthermore, USC has a specific dedication to globalization and creating worldly members of society.
The university’s current inaction could create a microcosm of foreign students who don’t really have an impetus to step out of their comfort zones further or to challenge themselves socially or culturally. International students have Parkside and exclusively international student unions, and many stick together as a result.
But international students don’t come to USC to have their homes recreated for them. They come to really experience studying in America and gain a greater understanding of other cultures.
No matter how many foreign nationals commit to being Trojans, the relative isolation the international student
community sometimes seems to prevent them from fully experiencing what it is like to live and learn at USC.
That is not to say international and domestic students alike don’t benefit greatly from the increasing international presence on our campus. USC has done, and will continue to do, an excellent job in bringing more international students to our campus.
But it wouldn’t hurt to reconsider how we do that and what we do once these students officially become a part of the Trojan Family.

The University Park campus might seem oasis-like with its towering palm trees, sparkling fountains and perfectly manicured expanses of flowers and lush grass. But don’t let this paradise in the city-scape of Los Angeles fool you; USC is, at the end of the day, a business — a very big business.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
University revenues totaled a whopping $3.13 billion in fiscal year 2010, against $2.7 billion of expenses for a $430 million profit in fiscal 2010, according to the university.
Like any effective business, USC needs to adapt to changing times to maintain a competitive advantage, and to continue expanding.
By putting more emphasis on recruiting overseas, USC is increasing profits while expanding our global brand and prestige.
In turn, this leads to more international revenue streams, keeping the university highly profitable and successful.
Giving to USC in 2010 accounted for just under $500 million and fiscal year 2011 has been a record year for donations, with the largest gift in the school’s history — a $200 million donation from Dana and David Dornsife last March. Giving is critical to the university — providing a source of funding for long-range ventures and expansion.
Giving has generally come from local and regional sources, with 73 percent of alumni residing somewhere within the Golden State. But with an upsurge this year in geographic diversity on campus — this year’s freshman class is the most international in the school’s history — comes an entirely new set of international financial ties among the university, incoming Trojans and their families.
A large proportion of these students come from nations with dynamic economies greatly outperforming that of the United States.
China’s economy is charging ahead, along with an array of other Asian nations; these nations are just developing a middle class and making the quantum leap from exclusively manufacturing to a more diversified economy.
South America is undergoing a renaissance, with Brazil emerging as a leader in commodities like oil while also beginning to follow through on its aspirations of positioning itself as a global cultural and technological leader.
Canada, is undergoing a housing boom and is working feverishly to manage the escalation in prices so boom turns to long-term boon and not devastating bust.
Even Europe’s battle-weary common currency, despite crisis after crisis, is still worth 30-50 percent more than our ailing dollar.
If USC is looking to grow the amount of charitable giving it receives each year, it needs to look where the global economic action is — outside the United States — and to the newest, international members of the Trojan Family.
That this incoming class is the most international is evidence alone of not only the growing global wealth but also of the place USC holds as a truly international campus.
Furthermore, USC’s array of study abroad and research programs in nations like China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, among others serve to bolster a global Trojan presence.
USC’s global profile is very evident and growing only faster annually; it’s why the school has been able to draw such a truly global and diverse student body.
But USC must leverage its major international exposure and newfound global ties on campus, converting academic ties into
financial ones.
Admitting the largest number of incoming international students in the university’s history isn’t just good for academics — it’s the
savviest business decision USC could make in the face of a weakening U.S. economy.
It might very well be a business development opportunity that does not present itself twice.

Where does that $430 million in profits go?  As a ‘non-profit’, my guess is that the money isn’t technically ‘profits’, but something else.  Does the money go back into the endowment?
I’d love some info on this if anyone has some.

When someone mentions USC, most people think football, game day, athletic and academic excellence and the Trojan Family. For international students hailing from outside of the United States, however, the avid USC sports culture might not ring so many bells.
Last fall, USC’s international student enrollment rose to an all-time high of 6,944 students. International students make up nearly 19 percent of overall student enrollment, yet can easily be lost when it comes to one of the most integral parts to the Trojan experience: football.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
“USC football doesn’t really get most international kids pumped up mainly because they haven’t seen it before or understand the rules of the game,” said Shiladitya Mukherjee, a senior from India majoring in  mechanical engineering. “However, I do think that the tailgates and the pre-game atmosphere contribute to the making international kids feel part of the Trojan Family.”
The American collegiate football culture at USC is unique in its ability to bring students, faculty and alumni together and runs parallel to the incomparably strong Trojan network, which links students to valuable connections via alumni and a strong sense of community.
Orientation sessions and school-run programs often fall short in truly integrating foreign students into the USC community.
Capitalizing on the football atmosphere USC is so well-known for would foster better international integration and could launch USC to an overall higher level of  quality.
The university should make an effort to integrate foreign students into the football scene by offering an informational workshop at international student orientation. By doing this, international students unfamiliar with the sport will be more able to understand and truly enjoy and immerse themselves in the USC football experience, and more importantly, the USC
experience.
Student organizations are also a great forum for integration through interaction with American students, who might be more knowledgeable about USC sports.
“There are quite a number of international student clubs and organizations that really help students ease into the culture at USC while giving them a taste of home at the same time,” Mukherjee said.
USC and California have a lot to gain from assuming a leadership role when it comes to being innovative in welcoming more international
students.
So much of USC life is shaped and defined by athletics. There couldn’t be a better, stronger, more interactive space than the USC sports culture with which we could increase international integration.

As students bike past the flag-filled Von KleinSmid Center, nearly crashing with someone from a country on the other side of the world, it’s becoming nearly impossible to ignore USC’s rapidly expanding global brand.
With an exponentially expanding international family, USC instills a sense of global citizenship in students that encourages them to reach outside the United States and make vital international connections that will further future careers.
Regardless of major, students come into contact with from across the globe and collaborate academically, socially and professionally.
The growing international  population and renowned diversity are just part of what makes USC special and expands the Trojan Family well beyond state boundaries.
According to the Office of Admission, traditionally about 30 percent of accepted international students choose to come to USC, but this semester USC expects 45 percent of those students to arrive. The drastic change reveals a significant increase in USC’s attractiveness abroad.
Recognizing that a global outlook expands students’ minds and academic horizons, USC has hosted several events overseas, such as the USC Global Conference taking place in Hong Kong in October, to attract international students and increase the university’s relevance abroad.
In recent years, USC has focused heavily on recruiting students from Southeast Asia and countries on the Pacific Rim.
An amplified Trojan presence in China — with the establishment of the USC U.S.-China Institute in 2006 — has helped increase the Chinese presence at USC, so much so that this semester USC will host more international students from mainland China than from any other country, with India at a close second.
USC also has offices in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Mexico, with plans to strengthen ties in Brazil and India.
USC’s international prominence, world-class faculty and high-performing students have helped elevate the university in the U.S. News and World Report’s rankings to
No. 23 in the nation, two spots ahead of UCLA and one behind UC Berkeley.
Just as USC embraces students from foreign lands, USC encourages current students to expand their horizons off campus and explore new countries.
With study abroad programs in six continents focusing on all fields of study, Trojans can become international students themselves, absorb foreign culture and return to USC and share their global experiences with other students.
By possessing such strong international ties USC prompts its students to strive to become “global scholars.”
Students are encouraged to learn a second language, incorporate a global perspective in their studies, participate in international clubs and campaigns, and simply observe the diversity on campus.
Not only do President C. L. Max Nikias’ trips abroad give USC a larger worldwide profile, but they also build the foundation for international projects where USC students can help a country better serve its citizens through medical, technological, commercial or some other form of research.
With a global perspective in class, dozens of internationally focused clubs, global research opportunities, and exciting study abroad programs, USC students gain vital exposure to other countries and cultures in an increasingly globalized world.
The university’s historically high acceptance of international students goes hand-in-hand with the university’s evolving mission to transform high school graduates into global scholars with the knowledge and contacts to change the world.
If that means USC must look outside of California to fill its classrooms, so be it.

Attached to admission to USC is a sense of pride, international student or otherwise.
USC Admissions is holding perspective students to higher standards and because of that, admission to USC is often the result of hard work, tenacity and courage.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
It seems reasonable enough that doing a good job should be rewarded: A lot of time put into studying should produce good grades, as training hard should produce better athletes. Admission to USC should be no different, but expectation is, as they say, often the root of all heartache.
Expectation becomes an especially dangerous liability when it comes not from the result of an action, but simply from a state of
being.
Orientation and Welcome Week both reinforce the idea of the Trojan Family for good reason. USC alumni are a formidable force, and students are integrated into the family quickly.
But placing such an emphasis on this aspect of identity isn’t particularly helpful for students who haven’t yet completed their first semester at USC.
Emphasizing the concept of family suggests a comforting sense of security, and opportunity for even a troubled student to return to loving arms.
On the other hand, it allows some students to believe after having conquered the hill of undergraduate admission they are now licensed to be lazy under the net of Trojan “family support.”
Though the concept of the Trojan Family is fantastic for students who endured similar struggles together, it also contributes to the list of deserved benefits under entitlement, that need not be earned by hard work but simply latently gained and in this case by self-definition.
This sort of entitlement can manifest itself through even the smallest items.
Anybody who has lived in a dorm is familiar with the condom bucket, or, in some cases, the ambiguous candy-condom bucket.
With this continuous supply of condoms, many students feel they deserve these contraceptives, and feel short-changed when the bucket isn’t filled in a timely manner to suit their needs, rather then appreciating the university for doing them a service by making free and conveniently placed condoms accessible.
Though the students and staff who participate in Orientation programs and Welcome Week programs deserve commendation for their active dedication to their school, and recognition for their talent and character, I cannot help but think the images of USC we present to incoming students do little to nothing to combat the label “University of Spoiled Children” given to us by our rivals.
Now of course, this can also be interpreted as a great compliment, and we can just as easily call those labeling us jealous or angry.
But the connotation of “spoiled” is often born not from envy of nice facilities, but from the attitudes of entitlement many students come to display.
Students privileged enough to attend USC should be sure to remember what they are given is not a right but a fortunate culmination of a number of events.
The privileges of being a member of the Trojan Family are not to be taken for granted.

We live in an increasingly globalized world.
Generation Z has created an interconnected society, and people will point to Twitter, Facebook and Google-Plus.
USC is making a transition from a primarily Californian school to one that has the largest international student body in the nation.
There are many positive aspects to the ever-growing international population at USC: We can share experiences with people from completely different backgrounds, learn from each other and collaboratively shape USC into the place we want it to be. There is a lot to be said for the value of diversity, for the value of becoming a global scholar.
This international influx benefits the student body and the university as a whole. It can boost the university in future rankings and firmly entrench USC as one of the top academic institutions in the country, led by a in president with an international perspective and an eye toward the future.
With the increased international presence among the student body, the curriculum should extend to become more global in focus. Though the current general education program does emphasize learning about cultures from around the world, there is still a heavy American focus.
As USC grows and broadens its horizons, so too will its classes. Through knowledge inside the classroom, students will be able to understand each other outside the classroom and truly become a cohesive student body.
Ideally, USC will become a beacon for diversity — a place where people from various cultures live, study and grow together.
But there is still work to be done. It’s never a seamless transition from living in one country and moving to another. Barriers do exist, and the collaborative spirit that has permeated in society should be embraced on campus.
The domestic community can make an effort of inclusion, or the international community could be the one to take that step.
Either way, despite difficulties that inherently exist when cultures mix, it’s clear USC is taking a positive step by bringing in its most international class yet.
I could not be more pleased with USC embracing diversity, and the Daily Trojan acknowledging the global community of Generation Z. There is unlimited potential for USC and the next generation in this space. 
Keep up the inspiring efforts to make USC a “beacon of diversity.”
Best,

“I can haz cheezburger?”
It was the meme that launched a million cat jokes. Once upon a time, someone decided to slap this grammatically challenged sentence onto a picture of a fat gray cat.
From that day forth, one of the Internet’s most popular jokes — the lolcat — was born.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
Memes are hard to take seriously. Most students use them to avoid their work.
According to Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, a meme is a cultural idea that repeats itself like a gene. Sometimes it repeats perfectly; sometimes it mutates into different variations.
Nevertheless, in all their ridiculousness, memes manage to do something extraordinary. They make humor cross cultural boundaries. They make people all over the world laugh at the same stupid stuff.
Although the original lolcat featured one cat with one misspelled phrase, there are now thousands of different cats with different misspelled phrases floating around the Internet. The lolcat spread, mutated and spread some more.
Everyone from journalists to politicians to academics has waxed poetic about the Internet’s ability to foster cooperation.
Though experts normally focus on things like information access and global fundraising, the silly jokes that show up on our Facebook newsfeeds are far more influential than abstract concepts.
Internet memes are examples of multicultural cooperation so simple, barely anyone thinks of them in such lofty terms.
Even as the global economy slides and countries peek at each other with increasing suspicion, a big chunk of us still laugh at the same jokes. We even work together to produce them.
Culture is so important in humor because nearly all jokes concern one of four primary social drives: affiliation, dominance, sex and novelty, according to Dutch psychologist Gert Jan Hofstede. We all want to have friends, feel powerful, attract people and experience new things. Most societies require us to cover up these urges with logic; jokes help us reveal them in an non-intimidating manner.
But the fourth drive, novelty, is different. Novel jokes appeal to what’s ridiculous and unexpected.
Those who want their jokes to become popular have a strong incentive to appeal to novelty. The more ridiculous something is, the more likely it is to be considered ridiculous all around the globe.
That’s what memes tap into: Our desire to see something so bizarre, it would make anyone laugh. In other words, if you want to get famous on the Internet, you’d better put your culture aside and figure out what’s funny to the rest of the world.
For example, consider the Swedish version of the lolcat. It’s a picture of a man with a horse’s head, captioned with “snel hest,” a misspelling of “snall hast” (Swedish for “nice horse”). People outside of Sweden might not understand the caption, but the idea that it’s strange for humans to have animal heads is pretty universal.
One Japanese meme started with a videogame glitch that made characters look like they were pulling crazy dance moves.
First, someone set the dancing to a song and uploaded the clip on YouTube.
Then, someone made an animated version. Finally, people have imitated the dance in real life. One of these people wears a horse mask.
Coincidence? I think not.
Makers of memes face a challenge: creating something that taps into our common sense of humor — a significant and underrated part of our common humanity.
How often are we asked to forget cultural assumptions for the sake of something as simple as a joke?
Memes are kind of beautiful that way. They should give us all comfort that — if nothing else — we can put our differences aside long enough to laugh at stupid cats.

The USC student body serves as a reflection of surrounding Los Angeles.  A diverse group of students and citizens crowd a specific area and represent their individual ethnic backgrounds, while also bringing a newfound eclectic mix of culture to their community as a whole. As a result, specific enclaves are reinvented with unique, internationally-infused identities.
This incoming freshman class has the highest international student body that USC has ever seen.  From this, a few questions come to light: Why is USC becoming increasingly more diverse, how can we connect this newfound diversity to L.A. culture and what does L.A. culture offer in the promise of exploring these new cultures that USC students have been exposed to?
You’ve heard it time and time again that Los Angeles is a melting pot of different cultures.  USC and Los Angeles serve as magnets to different cultures in hopes of newfound opportunities, whether it is school, work or an exciting new adventure.  As a result of these pursuits, Los Angeles has undergone an ethnic makeover, redefining both its image and the ongoings of its residents.
To understand the newfound meaning of Los Angeles’ identity, we have to study these multifarious backgrounds of our citizens.  With USC becoming increasingly more eclectic and, as a result, synonymous with Los Angeles, there’s all the more reason to explore Los Angeles to further familiarize ourselves with the city and school we’ve come to know and love.
The best way to accustom oneself with the Los Angeles and USC cultures we’re immersed in is to explore all components of lifestyle: film, music, events, books, games, night life, food and the like.
As with any new adventure, you have to dive in head first, releasing all inhibitions in order to gain the full experience. You have to eat, sleep and breathe Los Angeles to even begin to get a grasp of what this dynamic and charismatic city has to offer — and even that doesn’t begin to cover it.
Do as the locals do: Let your taste buds explore the multiethnic cuisine from practically every corner of the world, listen to the eccentric and diversified soundtracks representative of a mélange of different cultures and witness the vast assortment of art, expressive of every kind of individual ideal, that you can find widely dispersed throughout the city.
This issue delves specifically into the various methods of discovering Los Angeles.  Take for instance, the ethnic eateries that are worth your while, be they taco trucks or Korean barbecue, local shops and music festivals that are sure to entertain and tourist hot spots that won’t let you down.
Exploring the international culture of Los Angeles is practically a rite of passage for USC students.  How could you not be curious about your surrounding area especially when it’s as eclectic and diverse as Los Angeles?   Investigating the USC area is to have a worldly understanding that goes beyond the city.  You’ll become a more cultured individual in the process of perusing all that your newfound home has to offer, and of course while having a fabulous, wonderful and adventurous time.
Sounds like a promising year.

A rebound shot in the 40th minute, from 20 yards out — for the lead.
Amy Rodriguez is used to scoring. She scored 31 goals while at USC from 2005-2008 —fourth on the school’s all-time list. She scored 17 goals in 70 appearances on the international circuit.

But this goal was particularly timely. It didn’t just cushion a lead. It didn’t come in the waning minutes of a blowout. Instead, it put the U.S. women’s national soccer team up 1-0 over Italy in a qualifying match last November, propelling the United States to an eventual 2-0 victory over the Italians and a berth in the 2011 FIFA World Cup.
“The shot was deflected, there was a scramble in the box and I just got a foot on it,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez has had a flair for finding the net — she remains among the best scorers in women’s soccer today.
In the last three years alone, she has become USC’s first soccer medalist, earning a gold medal while playing for the United States in the 2008 Olympic Games, starting four of five games and scoring against New Zealand in group play and going No. 1 overall to the Boston Breakers in the 2009 Women’s Professional Soccer draft.
“That’s expected of her,” said Ali Khosroshahin, who coached Rodriguez for two seasons at USC. “She’s always had a great attitude; a willingness to work and learn.”
Yet, despite her offensive prowess and experience playing for the national team, the 5-foot-4 forward underwent her fair share of growing pains during last month’s World Cup.
Through five tournament games, all of which she started, Rodriguez was held scoreless, failing to connect on any of her nine shots — three of which were on goal.
“I did feel my performance was solid, very consistent,” Rodriguez said. “Yeah, I wish I would have put a goal up on the scoreboard for my team, but we won every game I played in.”
Although failing to score, she still had plenty of opportunities. Her ratio of shots on goal was 33.3 percent, good for third best among the team’s starters.
“Amy created some opportunities for herself and for her teammates,” Khosroshahin said. “She wasn’t able to capitalize on those opportunities for herself, but Amy’s a strong player and gets better as the game goes on.”
She didn’t, however, get that chance.
In the moments prior to the United States’ championship match against Japan on July 17, coach Pia Sundhage announced that Megan Rapinoe — not Rodriguez — would start in the final at forward, marking the first time she had not started all tournament.
“I was so excited to be in the World Cup final that I think it didn’t matter that I was sitting on the bench,” Rodriguez said.  “When the time came and if the coach needed me, I was going to be ready.”
But that time never came.
Although FIFA rules allow teams to make three substitutions per game, Sundhage opted to make just two.
In the 45th minute, Alex Morgan entered the game at forward for an injured Lauren Cheney, and in the 114th, Tobin Heath came in for Rapinoe. Rodriguez, who had scored three goals in the team’s previous three games against Japan, never left the bench.
“I think, when a player has that kind of a streak going on, you give her a few minutes, especially when they got into overtime and had a sub left,” Khosroshahin said. “But then again, I’m not there. It’s not my decision.”
With Rodriguez stuck on the sidelines, the United States squandered its lead not once but twice.
Following a goal from Morgan in the 69th minute, Japan’s Aye Miyama scored from five yards out, tying the game at one, after the United States failed to clear the ball in front of its own goal. Thirteen minutes after an Abby Wambach goal gave the United States a 2-1 lead, Homare Sawa flicked in a corner kick to knot the game at two.
Eventually, Japan won 3-1 on penalty kicks.
“We gave it all that we could,” Rodriguez said. “And on that day, it just wasn’t enough. But credit Japan. They played very well and have excellent P.K. shooters.”
For Rodriguez this is just the beginning. At age 24, she will likely play in at least one, possibly even two more World Cups, plus the 2012 or 2016 Olympics.
“She is only going to get better,” Khosroshahin said. “We haven’t seen the best of her. I think she’s going to be playing for a very long time.”

Welcome Week is a time of new beginnings, a time to meet your peers and immerse yourself in the Trojan lifestyle, a time to truly become one of the family. To do so, multiple activities are lined up for you to familiarize yourself with your fellow students and with USC. There’s one event in particular that stands out: the highly anticipated Welcome Week concert.
Headliners · Canadian indie-pop group Tokyo Police Club will headline the Welcome Week concert, jump-starting the fall semester with an evening sure to be filled with energy and high-spirited tunes. - Photo courtesy of Canvas Media
On Saturday at 7 p.m. in McCarthy Quad, you can look forward to a carnival put on by Program Board fully equipped with games and food trucks, followed by Y Luv, Pepper Rabbit and headliner Tokyo Police Club.
Y LUV
Y LUV, comprised of Freddy Janney (vocals, guitar), Sam Nardella (guitar, backup vocals), Luke Hanna (bass, backup vocals) and Marcello Dubaz (drums), will make an electrifying appearance at this year’s Welcome Week concert.
One of the most exciting appeals of Y LUV is that it is a variegated crew of fellow Trojans. Janney, Hanna, and Dubaz graduated last spring, and Nardella is a graduate of the class of 2010. Musically speaking, Y LUV emits pure, sonic energy and successfully puts its own original spin on familiar rock influences and sounds, like those of Arctic Monkeys, Kings of Leon and Bloc Party.
Pepper Rabbit
New Orleans natives, Pepper Rabbit, is an experimental duo (Xander Singh and Luc Laurent) that has been making itself known in Los Angeles.  With two albums and a handful of national tours under the group’s belt, Pepper Rabbit is proving it is not your typical, run-of-the-mill indie, hipster group.
Pepper Rabbit still has a peculiar creativity and audacity, however, that makes it an intriguing band to listen to.  Its sound, especially from the newer album, Red Velvet Snow Ball, semi-adheres to a generic pop music structure embellished with psychedelic motifs, multi-layered loops and a wide array of instruments — including everything from synths to ukuleles.
Pepper Rabbit is sure to be a new and enthralling experience.  For a preview of its music, check out the debut album Beauregard and the group’s latest, Red Velvet Snow Ball.
Tokyo Police Club
On top of Degrassi and Drake, Canada can add another sure-to-be hit to its extensive resume, Tokyo Police Club. This indie pop group comprised of Graham Wright (keys, percussion), Greg Alsop (drums), Josh Hook (guitar) and David Monks (vocals, bass) emerged in 2005, gaining instant notoriety and popularity.
Beginning its EP A Lesson in Crime, with its hit song “Smith,” Tokyo Police club got its name on the map. Immediate success spurred the full-length album Egg Shell, released in April 2008. Then came the sold-out tours in Los Angeles, Toronto and New York, along with late-night talk show appearances, including The Late Show with David Letterman.
Monks prefers not to label the group’s sound, stating, “There’s really not one thing to sum it up. Musically, we didn’t follow any kind of framework or preferred kind of song. Any direction we went is a direction that just felt fun.”
Whether you’re a dedicated fan or you haven’t even heard of them, Tokyo  Police Club has an undeniably catchy quality sure to leave you humming and tapping your feet along. Ring in the school year the right way with this fun, light summer concert.

Marcus Allen was a bruising running back with a nose for the end zone. His running style allowed him to become the first player in NCAA history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season and win the Heisman Trophy in 1981.
Prior to being honored by the Harold Pump Foundation, Allen spoke with the Daily Trojan about the current athletes playing his old position at his alma mater.

Daily Trojan: How would your coach, John Robinson, have handled the Marc Tyler situation?
Allen: John was a great teacher, motivator and psychologist. John would have been stern, and yet tried to sit down with Marc to really take a look at the things that happened and why they happened. If he wants to have a bright future, these things can no longer happen. I have talked to his dad, [former UCLA and NFL running back] Wendell, and he is very disappointed but loves his son.
One of the things our society deals with is drinking. I thank god I never did, but that is one of the challenges for our youth. Alcohol clearly ruled the day. I like Marc a lot. I think he is a very good person. He has made some bad choices, but we all have.
DT: What do you expect from the rest of USC’s running backs?
Allen: Playing tailback, even though years have gone by and other positions have been highlighted, we always felt that the running back is the biggest single key to our success at USC. At the end of the day, you have to stop with all of the fast-break football and settle down to play a half-court football game.
If you cannot run the ball, if you cannot convert on third and short, fourth and goal, third and goal or even second and goal, you are in deep trouble. It is such a critical part of football. When it is all said and done, and all the fancy stuff is out the window, you have to bear down and hit the other guy in the mouth, and hit him in the mouth again and again. That is the essence of football, and that is what I hope we get back to.

What a difference a year makes.
Last summer it became a daily ritual to digest a smattering of national headlines regarding USC football along with my morning cereal. This summer, however, it seems the only buzz surrounding the team is senior tailback Marc Tyler’s well-documented night on the town.
Though some teams would do just about anything to get a 10-second spot on Highlight Express, the silence could not have come at a better time for the Trojans.
With the NCAA squashing its appeal, USC finally ended a 19-month media field day that vilified the program and made it seem like a thousand student agents lie in wait outside of practice each day to woo players with various improper benefits.
Now, without any legal battles or investigations pending, the team is left with just its season to focus on, which for the first time in a long time contains traces of consistency from the year prior.
If this doesn’t seem like a huge development to you, then consider this:
The team has already spent a year adjusting to coach Lane Kiffin and his staff. A harsh realization for many USC fans last season was that no amount of talent could make up for a lack of experience and comfort within a system — a truth that was especially obvious on defense. Now, not only do returning players have in-game reps from last season to build on, cornerback Nickell Robey and now-defensive end Devon Kennard, have had an entire offseason to prime their wheels.
Assistant head coach Monte Kiffin is sitting on a wealth of young talent for the second year in a row. But for the first time, he’s not playing catch-up to prepare his players for the fall. This should pay dividends, especially early in the season.
But even more so, this is the first season in recent memory where the annual revolving door that is graduation and the NFL draft didn’t completely decimate the Trojans on either side of the ball. This isn’t 2009 when the Trojans had to replace their entire linebacker core in All-Americans Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews and Rey Maualuga. The defense will have seven starters, the most it’s had in the last three years. The offense, though slightly fresher, returns with its key players in tow, including the dynamic tandem of junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods.
Never mind that there won’t be a bowl game to play — everyone who isn’t a new student has dealt with that reality already — and forget that the team can’t win a Pac-12 championship. These things won’t prevent a player from doing everything in his power to win a game.
“There is a lot of build up before the season about no bowl games,” Kiffin said. “But once you get going, you’re in practices and you’re walking down that Coliseum and getting ready to play, I really don’t think they think much about that.”
The talent has been put in place by Kiffin and his staff. And thanks to the end of the media hype, there should no longer be anything hindering the team’s mental preparation.
Of course, as with any season, there are a lot of “ifs” that will determine the ultimate success of the team. But compared to last year, the magnitude and weight of these “ifs” are much smaller. The 2010 Trojans dealt with almost every distraction imaginable and still were just a few mistakes, blown plays and ill-timed penalties away from recording a 10-win season. The current squad has had a year to get accustomed to the unstable environment they play in, and now that the hoopla of past transgressions has died down, it will be easier to move forward.
For the time being, embrace the silence a long, hot summer has brought to USC. If the Trojans continue to mature the way they have over the past year, there will be more than enough headlines to take in once the team hits the field.

The starting tailback job at USC comes with some hefty expectations and a whole lot of history. Five Trojans have won the Heisman Trophy at the position, earning USC the nickname “Tailback U.”
Opportunity · After a tumultuous freshman year in which he was suspended on two seperate occasions, sophomore tailback Dillon Baxter could start in the Trojans’ season opener against Minnesota on Sept. 3. - Daily Trojan file photo
The job was supposed to be senior Marc Tyler’s this year, but USC is looking to other players to step up after coach Lane Kiffin suspended Tyler from the season opener against Minnesota.
Tyler was suspended after comments he made in an interview with TMZ, when he implied that USC paid its players. The Trojans’ leading rusher last season with 913 yards and nine touchdowns, Tyler has been barred from team practices, workouts and meetings but has been working out alone at Heritage Hall, Kiffin said.
“He may never be back,” Kiffin said at Pac-12 media day in late July. “We would hope that he’s back. That would mean he’s got everything in order.”
USC’s running back stable is deep and talented, but none of the others quite have the size the 230-pound Tyler offers.
Speedy redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan appears to be one of the leading candidates to start the opener based on carries in practice.
Morgan spent last season recovering from a torn ACL suffered during his senior year of high school. Though he didn’t log any game action in 2010, Morgan still impressed the coaching staff enough to win an award given to the team’s best offensive player in practice last season.
“I just want to get better so the coaches don’t have to worry about me as much,” Morgan said. “I want to be one of those guys that they know is going to do the right thing.”
Morgan’s speed — he won the California state title in the 110-meter hurdles in high school — is his greatest asset, but the coaches expect him to do a better job in securing the ball to avoid fumbles.
Sophomore Dillon Baxter returns after one of the most talked-about freshman seasons in school history. Unfortunately for Baxter, the talk centered on what he did off the field — he was suspended for last year’s opener at Hawaii for a violation of team rules and held out of a Nov. 20 game at Oregon State for contact with an agent — rather than what he accomplished on it — 59 carries for 252 yards.
Kiffin has been impressed with what he’s seen so far from Baxter, noting on the first day of camp he came back “bigger, faster and stronger than he was” and that “he’s a different guy, attitude-wise.”
Baxter also said he is focusing on getting up the field quicker, rather than “dancing” behind the line of scrimmage.
“I have too much speed so I’ve got to get somewhere soon,” Baxter said. “I guess it’s better to just cut up and make moves later.”
Junior Curtis McNeal is the elder statesman of the group, but has only carried the ball six times during his Trojan career. Generously listed at 5-foot-7, McNeal’s bruising running style defies stereotypes about his small frame.
“I run the ball hard every time,” McNeal said. “Every time I get a chance to knock somebody out, I knock them out.”
McNeal missed all of last season because he was academically ineligible, but Kiffin announced last week McNeal would be eligible this fall.
“You just don’t know,” McNeal said about his excitement to play again this year. “Once I figured it out and got a hold of everything, I was just like, ‘Yes, I can finally just focus on football.’”
The chase to replace Tyler for the opener was expected to be a three-way race until true freshman Amir Carlisle turned heads on the first day of fall practice with his big play potential.
Carlisle, a high school All-American at Kings Academy in Northern California, rushed for 2,110 yards and 28 touchdowns during his senior season.
Kiffin and quarterback Matt Barkley routinely listed Carlisle’s name first when asked which freshmen impressed them early in USC’s fall camp.
“Amir’s standing out,” Kiffin said after one practice. “He continues to every day.”
Despite the dog-eat-dog nature of the competition, the running backs insist they have stayed close as a group.
“We all hang out on our off time,” Morgan said. “We even still talk to Marc. He texts me every day and we talk. He tells me how he’s doing and I tell him what we’re doing out here.”

Masked by a genuine humbleness in tone, there lies an air of confidence in the voice of junior safety T.J. McDonald.
Mr. Dependable · Junior safety T.J. McDonald will be asked to anchor a secondary that struggled mightily in its first year under coach Lane Kiffin. - Daily Trojan file photo
It takes no longer than 10 seconds into a conversation with him to understand if things are to turn around for USC assistant coach Monte Kiffin’s defensive unit in 2011, it will most certainly start with McDonald’s youthful optimism and lead-by-example mentality.
Last year’s defensive ineptitude (USC gave up 400 yards and 26.7 points per game) is quite possibly out of sight, out of mind for the second-year starting safety.
“It’s the best defense I have been a part of in my three years,” McDonald said about this year’s defense. “Looking back on my freshman year, we had Taylor Mays, Malcolm Smith, Will Thomas and Josh Pinkard. And to be honest we have those same caliber players right here this year. People think it’s just about me, it’s not.”
His sentiments seem genuine. If there’s anything you should know about the captain of the secondary, it’s that he chooses his words carefully.
Some lead by chanting and yelling during team huddles, but McDonald, who led the team with 89 tackles in 2010, chooses to back up his calculated statements with game-changing hits and a knack for hunting down ball carriers.
“Anyone can be a vocal guy, but I try to make sure I’m saying something by my actions on the field,” McDonald said. “I sort of became a leader last year, by the way I studied the game, the fact that I was never satisfied and always wanted more.”
It’s no wonder McDonald feels a natural inclination to lead. His father, six-time NFL Pro Bowler Tim McDonald, was an All-American safety for the Trojans in 1986 and went on to play 13 seasons professionally. Though it would be easy to hide in the shadow of his father’s success, the Fresno, Calif. native admits honoring the family name serves as motivation, not as a distraction.
“My father’s the guy who taught me the game of football, and also the one who instilled in me an appreciation for the game,” McDonald said. “I want this so bad because I consider myself round two of the McDonald family legacy at USC. I have big shoes to fill, and I’m not going to fill those just by showing up.”
Those big shoes don’t apply to just his surname. USC’s current star safety falls in a long line of other talented Trojans who have made a name for themselves at the position — former teammate Taylor Mays, 2010 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu and Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott to name a few.
But don’t expect McDonald to shy away from the limelight that comes with playing the position at USC, either.
“If you don’t have the confidence to believe that you are one of the best safeties in the nation, you’re not in the right area of work,” McDonald said. “With all due respect to everyone else, I am not out here to be the best safety on my team or in the conference, I am here to be the best in the country.”
Although McDonald glows about the night-and-day transformation the defense has undergone over the last eight months, the disappointment from last year’s season, the worst statistically since 1955, is still readily noticeable.
“I know the entire defense came out playing hard with a chip on our shoulder,” McDonald said. “It was an experience that was probably needed. And because of it, our team chemistry is now to the point where we have become brothers out here. It might sound cliché, but we have become a real family.”
As a sense of the unknown continues to envelop the so-called family, while it prepares this fall at Howard Jones Field, Kiffin believes McDonald’s team-first attitude is not lost on his teammates.
“He’s so important to our defense because of those leadership skills,” Kiffin said. “He leads in ways you can’t see on the field, both in the weight room and during off-season conditioning drills. His teammates pick up on that.”
Despite the mounting pressure for the junior to lead a defense out of its recent futile past, McDonald enters 2011 with a necessary dose of swagger and unwavering self-assurance.
“Wherever the ball goes, I am going to be there,” McDonald said.

Football is fast approaching, and there is, as always, plenty of NCAA administrative nonsense to gripe about. This season, USC will reprise its role as the governing body’s redheaded stepchild, sheltered from postseason play and short a handful of scholarships. Meanwhile, the NCAA continues to sniff out problems at North Carolina, Ohio State and Oregon, causing fans to wonder whether they await USC-esque sanctions as well.
Amidst the controversy, it seems there should be a more fitting way to handle these nagging issues beyond the standard procedure of enforcement, coincided with dolling out myriad penalties lacking in consistency. In many ways, it’s getting a little tiresome.
The way violations are reported now lacks transparency. On most occasions, someone with knowledge leaks key information to the media, causing the NCAA to act on the information in turn. There has to be something more practical, and accordingly, it is now an appropriate time to try a system of amnesty for the nation’s college athletic programs.
In brief, amnesty would be a pardon for offenses, allowing schools to come forward to the NCAA with known violations at the cost of only a reprimand — basically serving as a get-out-of-jail-free card.
There is already some sense of amnesty, as when programs openly report secondary violations, they face virtually no repercussions from the NCAA, but the goal for instituting amnesty would be for major missteps: things like a lack of institutional control or a failure to monitor.
Such a provision would promote transparency between the NCAA and its member schools and dissuade the underhanded tactic of selling out violators.
For USC, a lack of transparency remains an issue that hits particularly close to home. While the NCAA hardly hesitated to slap the Trojans with the infamous lack of institutional control penalty, seemingly less “controlled” predicaments at North Carolina and Ohio State have managed to evade a similar daunting fate — at least for now. A sufficient explanation to anyone has yet to be issued.
The NCAA has often been quick to point out that enforcement is not a criminal proceeding; it has failed, however, to explain exactly how penalties are doled out. Is it based on past precedent, certain guidelines or is the Committee on Infractions given carte-blanche to sanction institutions on a whim?
We’ve yet to be given clarification in this regard, even 14 months removed from the actual rendered decision, so to some degree, at least amnesty would remove the ever-so-thick curtain that stands between the NCAA and the general public.
Though it would promote openness (heck, call it the NCAA’s own version glasnost), it’d serve as only a temporary fix. Once the provision was enacted, it’d be reasonable to assume schools that have historically sidestepped NCAA bylaws would quickly use the safety net to take advantage of the system. After a few years, wouldn’t we be facing this current predicament yet again?
Yet, the concept of transparency might be sufficient enough to at least warrant some consideration from the NCAA. It isn’t perfect, but what exactly is?
USC has experienced firsthand the damage the NCAA hammer can impose. Because of sanctions, USC will not be able to maximize scholarship offerings until the 2015 season. The program, at least according to some experts, won’t be at full strength until 2017 or maybe even 2018. You could say it’s been dealt an unfavorable hand.
So why not give a school that’s so great for the sport a chance to come clean and avoid ruin?
Amnesty could, as a result, be a good-faith gesture on the part of the NCAA to smooth over relations with its member schools and shed the perception that it is a ruthless dictator.
It might not be effective enforcement, but it could at least provide some clarity and uniformity to an already muddied process.

“So why not give a school that’s so great for the sport a chance to come clean and avoid ruin?”
It already exists:  it is called self-investigating, self-sanctioning, and public disclosure. Schools that choose this course — as USC failed to choose for 5 years — are not given harsh sanctions, are not ruined.  Schools that follow USC’s lead in denial deserve whatever penalties they reap, are not worthy of amnesty. 
“…a good-faith gesture on the part of the NCAA to smooth over relations with its member schools and shed the perception that it is a ruthless dictator.”
Whose perception?  The perception of heavily sanctioned schools?  Trojans’ perception. What is the compelling reason to smooth over a relationship with a school that caused the strain in the first place? The NCAA strikes most as a just, voluntary organization which USC is free to quit.  The Trojans could start their own organization that gives amnesty to cheaters.  That is sure to lure schools from coast to coast, all the schools that share this perception you speak of.  Lead the way, Daily Trojan.

With games in Las Vegas, Minnesota and Washington, the USC men’s basketball team has the opportunity to travel the country this season. The sightseeing highlight of the year, however, will take place in South America.
Experience · Senior guard Jio Fontan, one of two returning starters, averaged 10.5 points per game in 2011, his first season with the Trojans. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan
Every four years, the NCAA allows basketball teams to travel to a foreign country to compete against local teams, in addition to 10 extra days of practice.
This year USC coach Kevin O’Neill and his squad will travel to Brazil for a series of preseason exhibition games over 10 days in Rio de Janeiro, as well as Sao Paolo.
“I am really excited to get out there and see another part of the world,” USC senior guard Jio Fontan said.
The Trojans return just two starters, Fontan and sophomore guard Maurice Jones, from last year’s team, which fell to Virginia Commonwealth in the First Four round of the NCAA tournament in March.
As a result, for such an inexperienced group of players, it is advantageous to have 10 extra days of practice in August as opposed to waiting for the traditional opening of practice in mid-October.
“We are getting to know each other, and the younger guys are getting the jitters out of the way,” Fontan said. “They are getting their first practices a little earlier in the year so they know what to expect when the season starts.”
To best prepare his team for the regular season, O’Neill wanted to schedule games against the top teams available in Brazil.
“We hope that the competition is pro-level teams,” O’Neill said. “That is what we asked for. We had the choice of playing first or second level teams, and we wanted to play the highest level teams.”
With 10 days together in an unfamiliar environment, Fontan also looks forward to bonding with his teammates and developing some cohesiveness.
“There are going to be a lot more face-to-face conversations, being social with each other,” Fontan said. “It is a great way to start the season, and to build team chemistry.”
Some coaches initiate special rules on foreign trips — such as forbidding text messaging — to encourage players to interact with each other, but O’Neill allows his team greater freedom off the court.
“I don’t have any rules like that,” O’Neill said. “They can talk to whoever they want as long as they play hard.”
USC will count heavily on an influx of transfers — junior guard Greg Allen (Navarro College), junior center James Blasczyk (Texas A&M), sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon (Antelope Valley College) and junior forward Aaron Fuller (Iowa).
The Trojans also add freshman guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley, in addition to sophomore forward Evan Smith, who returns after redshirting last season because of a shoulder injury.
“We are all [O’Neill] recruits,” Fontan said. “It is a new era, and we are having a great time.”
The last time the Trojans traveled abroad was to Mexico in 2007 with a squad led by guards Dwight Lewis and O.J. Mayo, as well as center Taj Gibson.
The Trojans open the 2011-2012 season at home against Cal State Northridge on Nov. 11.
“We are a hard playing group,” O’Neill said. “We are deeper and more athletic. We have a lot of guys with a lot to prove. I like our attitude, our team play, how we share the ball and that we play together on both ends.”

Not everyone has forgotten about Reggie Bush.
Senior Peter Yobo, a Ghana native and a walk-on for the USC football team, had dreamed about attending USC since he was a teenager.
“When I was in high school … I was watching ESPN in Ghana and I saw a clip of USC, a highlight of Reggie Bush, the fans and the excitement,” Yobo said. “Ever since then, I was excited and I knew I wanted to go to USC.”
Yobo’s dream came true when he transferred to USC from San Jose State University in 2010.
Before donning the cardinal and gold, he decided to start up an organization called iStandAbove, which focuses on empowering youth worldwide.
The organization teaches three core values: leadership, teamwork and creativity.  This will ultimately help them come to the realization that they can achieve their dreams.
“What made me want to start up that organization came from my experiences from Ghana,” Yobo said. “If you surround yourself with the right resources, you can achieve whatever you want.”
And that’s exactly what Yobo did.
Rather than just settling at San Jose State, Yobo used the work ethic and discipline his parents instilled in him at a young age to achieve his ultimate goal of attending his dream school after two years.
“My whole family emulates hard work and being disciplined,” Yobo said. “I stuck to school only, hit my books, made sure I had great grades and transferred over.”
Once at USC, Yobo took advantage of every opportunity the university offered.
He walked onto the football team in fall 2010, and despite not having any experience playing the sport, coach Lane Kiffin and staff still gave him a chance.
They gave him a chance to prove himself, to show that he belonged.
“I never thought or dreamed of playing football,” Yobo said. “Just the fact that the coaches would take someone who hasn’t played at all and get me to a level where I’m at right now, it shows how good of a school it really is.”
The old stereotype refers to USC as just a football school, but there is so much more than just sports at this university.
Embracing everything the Trojan Family stands for, Yobo immersed himself in the community and culture of the school, joining the track and field team and becoming an active member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.
USC has provided the resources and opportunities Yobo imagined when coming to USC. Getting involved around campus, meeting new people and forming relationships have been more than he could ask for.
“At USC, my interactions with people, through the networking, people being there when you need help, people always want to see you succeed and be a better person,” Yobo said. “Just those things are enough.”
But Yobo is not doing all this for his own benefit.
He knows he’s setting an example for his younger sister back home, as well as others in Ghana, who might not be afforded the opportunity to experience what he has in the United States.
Transferring to USC and starting his iStandAbove organization has given him a platform to use and be a voice for youth and his country.
“There’s a lot of [people] outside and they feel I’m not good enough to do this or I’m too little to do this,” Yobo said. “But knowing you can stand above any stumbling block that you face in life, you can overcome it and turn it into a stepping stone.”
Being a role model for his family and fellow citizens back home by attending one of the premier universities in the United States has given Yobo the motivation and courage to make a difference.
“I’m here, but I never dreamed of being here,” Yobo said. “ It just shows that hard work does pay off. Always look up, expect more for yourself and never settle for less.”

When NCAA sanctions initially fell on USC, coach Lane Kiffin was fond of telling reporters wondering about the decline of the program that “USC is still USC.” Although last year’s 8-5 record might have failed to illustrate Kiffin’s point, the Trojans’ success in recruiting — Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com ranked the program’s 2011 class No. 4 nationally — has not halted.
Surprise · Although just a freshman, tailback Amir Carlisle has impressed coaches in fall camp thus far and could start for the Trojans. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Now, with fall camp in full swing, here are five incoming freshmen to keep an eye on this season.
 
1.) Amir Carlisle: Tailback
Carlisle, a four-star recruit from Santa Clara, Calif. has surprised coaches and teammates as the early freshman standout in fall practice. The 5-foot-10 speedster, who averaged 10 yards per carry during his career at Kings Academy, drew praise from Kiffin early on for his work ethic and maturity, as well as his explosiveness.
Senior middle linebacker Chris Galippo and junior quarterback Matt Barkley have also remarked that Carlisle’s play reminds them of sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who earned Pac-10 Player of the Year honors a season ago.
“I love his attitude of working hard,” Barkley said. “It’s kind of similar how Robert approached fall camp last year — just putting his head down and working.”
With senior tailback Marc Tyler suspended indefinitely, Carlisle will compete with sophomore Dillon Baxter, junior Curtis McNeal and freshman D.J. Morgan for the starting role.
 
2.) Lamar Dawson: Linebacker
Aside from the jerseys draping the Peristyle end of the Coliseum, there is no player number as important in USC football lore as the mythical No. 55. Typically given to a standout linebacker, it has been worn by the likes of Junior Seau, Chris Claiborne and Keith Rivers, most recently.
With that kind of history behind the number, it was understandably big news when Dawson was given the No. 55 jersey before playing in a single game for the Trojans. Dawson, a four-star prospect from Danville, Ky., is expected to potentially start at outside linebacker for the Trojans. He has been known for his hard hitting and ability to stuff the run with his huge size at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds.
In assistant coach Monte Kiffin’s complex defensive scheme, Dawson will have a steep learning curve ahead of him, but following the graduation of Michael Morgan, he also has every opportunity to earn significant playing time.
 
3.) George Farmer: Wide receiver
Farmer has drawn comparisons to Woods since he first committed to USC in December of 2010, and not just because he was Woods’ teammate at Gardena Serra High School. At 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, he was considered to be a bigger, faster and stronger version of Woods coming out of high school.
As USC’s only consensus five-star recruit, he is Barkley’s roommate for fall camp and the third-year signal caller has already raved about the freshman’s determination to learn the Trojans’ offense quickly.
If Farmer develops the route-running skills and awareness that defined Woods’ first season, he could end up starting opposite his old teammate come September.
 
4.) Andre Heidari: Kicker
Heidari is unique because as the only scholarship kicker recruited by a USC program that historically has preferred walk-ons in recent years. In all fairness, it is unlikely that he will produce electrifying highlights like Woods did in his first season.
Though Woods left fans breathless last season, Heidari’s predecessor Joe Houston made them hold their breath whenever he lined up for field goals. Houston was 10-of-16 on field goal attempts for a lackluster 62 percent.
Those numbers are even more alarming when considering the fact that three of USC’s five losses in 2010 were decided by less than three points. So Heidari, a Bakersfield, Calif. native — the only scholarship kicker on the roster — will have the chance to make good on his billing as one of the top kicking prospects in his class.
 
5.) Aundrey Walker: Right Guard/Right Tackle
One of the biggest concerns for the Trojans heading into the 2011 season is the offensive line. The unit only boasts two players with significant starting experience in junior center Khaled Holmes and junior left tackle Matt Kalil. As a result, USC will have to fill both guard spots and the critical right tackle position.
Walker, a four-star prospect from Cleveland, Ohio, enters camp as the Trojan’s most esteemed offensive line recruit, and at 6-foot-6 and 375 pounds, he has the size to justify the hype. Considered an option at right tackle, the solid play of sophomore tackle Kevin Graf during camp might mean Walker will end up at guard or in some sort of rotation.

With 11 national championships and six Heisman Trophy winners, USC has become synonymous with football, and for good reason. The football program, however, can sometimes cast its Coliseum-sized shadow over the other members of what is one of the country’s deepest and most successful athletic programs.
The “other” USC sports teams have combined for 93 NCAA titles —  17 since the turn of the millennium. The men’s water polo and tennis teams will be going for their respective fourth straight national championships this academic year.
Here’s a look at the top Trojan athletes who will be playing their trade away from the gridiron this fall:
 
Joel Dennerly: Men’s Water Polo
Since Joel Dennerly took over between the pipes for USC as a freshman in the fall of 2008, the Trojans have won three straight national championships. Coincidence? The numbers and accolades suggest otherwise.
His 641 career saves place him second on USC’s all-time list — 34 shy of Kevin Stringer’s record — with his senior season still to play.
Dennerly’s stellar junior campaign earned him Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year honors as well as a selection to the All-America first team.
He’ll bring even more experience to USC this fall, having appeared in three matches for his native Australia at the recently completed World Aquatics Championship in Shanghai, piling up 17 saves on 28 shots.
 
Peter Kurzeka: Men’s Water Polo
While Dennerly was tending the Trojans’ net, senior driver Peter Kurzeka has spent his past three seasons piling up goals — 100 of them to be exact.
Kurzeka’s 41 goals in 2010 were the second most on the team but it was the timing of some of those scores that set him apart.
He was named the NCAA Tournament MVP after scoring the game-winning goal in USC’s 12-10 overtime win over Cal in last year’s national title game.
Kurzeka, a first-team All-America selection, is one of only three seniors on USC’s squad, which will begin its quest for a historic four-peat at the UC Irvine Invitational in early September.
 
Alex Jupiter: Women’s Volleyball
In 2010, the Paris-born outside hitter Jupiter led the Women of Troy to their first NCAA Final Four appearance since 2007 and earned first team All-American honors for her play.
Jupiter led USC in kills and points last year and returns this fall for her senior season.
Jupiter has several career USC records in her sights. She is 395 kills shy of Jennifer Kessy’s all-time mark of 1,799 — Jupiter has posted more than 500 kills in each of the last two seasons. She also sits second in school history with 1,636 career points — only 24 away from breaking Keao Burdine’s record.
 
Falyn Fonoimoana: Women’s Volleyball
As if Jupiter weren’t enough for opposing defenses to contend with, outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana established herself as one of the conference’s top attackers in her freshman season.
The 6-foot-4 Hermosa Beach native finished second on the team in kills and points, earning recognition as the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
She didn’t shrink from the spotlight either, coming up huge in USC’s upset of No. 3 Stanford in last year’s regional final, assuring the Women of Troy a place in the Final Four.
Fonoimoana posted season-highs in kills (25) and digs (14) in the match, and was named MVP of the Dayton Regional.
Fonoimoana returns for the 2011 season along with the rest of USC’s starting seven. The Women of Troy will play their home opener on Sept. 9 against UCLA.
 
Sophia Popov: Women’s Golf
You’d think that as a freshman from Germany, Sophia Popov would have needed some time to settle into the rhythm of American culture and the stresses of university life before really lighting up the college golf landscape.
Well, think again. Popov won three tournaments in her first year as a Trojan — including the Pac-10 individual championship — and helped lead USC to its fourth Pac-10 team title in program history. For her efforts, Popov was named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.
She’s had a busy summer too, making the cut and finishing 67th at the Women’s British Open, the second highest amateur finisher at the event.
Martin Trainer: Men’s Golf
Not to be outdone by its female counterparts, the USC men’s golf team also claimed the Pac-10 team and individual titles last season, with Martin Trainer winning the latter.
The junior strung together four top-seven finishes near the end of last season and led the team with a 72.46 stroke average.
His performance at last year’s Pac-10 championships also earned him an exemption into the PGA Tour’s Reno-Tahoe Open, where he made the cut and finished in a tie for 71st at 3-over-par.
So, at the beginning of another sure to be football-filled fall, it’s worth recognizing some of USC’s sports stars not named Barkley, McDonald or Woods.

USC women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin makes the team’s goal very clear at the beginning of the season.
“At USC, the goal is to win a national championship,” Khosroshahin said. “Whenever I see [Athletic Director] Pat Haden he says to me ‘What are you doing today to help us win the national championship?’”
The Women of Troy won the national championship in 2007, Khosroshahin’s first year with the program. Only fifth-year senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval remains from that squad, and the rest of the current team is eager to share in the excitement.
“We want to win a national championship, but in order to get there, we need to come together as a team,” Sandoval said.
Standing between USC and its goal is one of the nation’s most difficult nonconference schedules, which includes a game against every team in the grueling new Pac-12 and, of course, a 64-team, single-elimination tournament that will crown the NCAA champion.
The Women of Troy bowed out of the tournament in the second round last year, taking a 4-0 loss to eventual champion Notre Dame on a frigid afternoon in South Bend, Ind. It was USC’s second consecutive year failing to make it out of the opening weekend, after losing to Oklahoma State on penalty kicks in the opening round in 2009.
USC will get a chance for revenge against Oklahoma State this year when it hosts the Cowgirls and the Texas Longhorns in the Trojan Invitational on Sept. 9 and 11 at McAlister Field. The tournament is the centerpiece of a nonconference schedule that includes the likes of San Diego, Illinois and Portland. Oklahoma State finished last season ranked No. 5 in the nation, and Portland finished at No. 8 after spending most of the season ranked No. 2.
Illinois and San Diego finished just outside the top-25, but the Women of Troy still have those games circled. The Torero’s swept a home-and-home series from USC last year, leaving a very bitter taste.
It’s the Fighting Illini who will be looking for revenge when the Women of Troy visit Champaign, Ill., on Nov. 2. USC bested Illinois 3-1 in last year’s opening round of the NCAA tournament.
It gets no easier for the Women of Troy as they enter the Pac-12 conference. Last season as the Pac-10, the conference garnered  seven NCAA tournament berths and finished with four ranked teams. Although every team in the conference plays each other once, almost all of USC’s marquee games come on the road. The team will play at perennial powerhouses Stanford and California and will travel to Seattle for the Women of Troy’s matchup with Washington, which finished last season ranked No. 15. Finally, the team will end its season against UCLA in Westwood.
“I haven’t really taken notice of the other teams joining the Pac-12,” Sandoval said. “But I think our team is a lot better than last year, so I think we have a really good shot at taking conference.”
The Women of Troy figure to be a more experienced team in general this year. They lost three starters, but the team features an incoming freshman class that could make an immediate impact.
Of his incoming class, Khosroshahin and many others mentioned forward Jessica Musmanno out of New Jersey as a player he thinks could contribute from day one.
“The freshmen are catching up really fast,” Sandoval said. “But the older players are doing a really good job of relating our experience to them.”
The Women of Troy had a standout freshman forward last year, too.  Sophomore Autumn Altamirano finished second on the team in goals and scored the most dramatic goal of the season in the 86th minute to give USC a 1-0 win over UCLA at the Coliseum.
Altamirano is just one of a very deep sophomore class that also includes forward Elizabeth Eddy (five goals last season) and goalkeeper Shelby Church (played every minute in goal last season), among others.
Still, Khosroshahin does expect to see some improvement from what was already a very solid class.
“There was a lot of inconsistency last year in terms of understanding the game plan,” Khosroshahin said. “Our game plan is hard to understand at first, but we do expect more consistency in general this year.”
And the Women of Troy will need consistency from the whole team — not just their sophomore class — if they want to make a deep tournament run and reach their ultimate goal of a national championship.

With no scholarship kickers or punters and a lack of emphasis during practice, USC’s special teams have been largely unremarkable in recent years. But following the hire of Fresno State’s John Baxter as associate head coach and special teams coordinator in March 2010, many of the unit’s issues were shored up — at least to some degree — last season.
Head start · Freshman placekicker Andre Heidari, taking over for the graduated Joe Houston, arrived as an early enrollee for spring practice. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
In 2010, USC blocked nine field goals and extra point attempts, a significant improvement in production for a team that blocked just two in the season prior.
“This is where we improved the most the year before we got here to last year,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Perhaps most notably, during a Nov. 6 contest at home against Arizona State, with USC trailing by four points with 6:59 remaining in the fourth quarter, then-freshman cornerback Torin Harris returned a blocked extra point attempt for two points, cutting the deficit in half. The Trojans eventually secured a 34-33 victory on a late field goal from kicker Joe Houston.
Subsequently, the Trojans hope that upward trend continues in 2011.
“It’s a big part of who we are,” Baxter said. “The bottom line is: the ball gets kicked, we’re trying to block it. We can’t emphasize it more than we do.”
Baxter’s newly implemented schemes were fruitful in other areas of special teams as well a season ago. In the return game, the Trojans averaged 14.6 yards per return on punts, good for seventh nationally, and 24.5 yards per return on kickoffs, 17th nationally.
But punt returner Ronald Johnson, who returned an 89-yard punt for a touchdown in the team’s season opener against Hawaii, has graduated, meaning either junior tailback Curtis McNeal, sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey or sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods will take over return duties.
USC must also replace its kicker and punter from 2011 in Houston and Jacob Harfman.
Baxter, however, remains unfazed, citing the group’s cohesiveness.
“The biggest thing is the team chemistry right now,” Baxter, the second-year coordinator, said. “This team and this unit has really bought into doing things the Trojan way. The older guys have done a lot of things to help the younger guys.”
And some of them are young.
In the kicking game, USC is expected to rely on two true freshmen in kicker Andre Heidari and punter Kris Albarado.
“Obviously our specialists are new, so that’s a big challenge,” Baxter said.
Statistically, field goal kicking has been one of USC’s weakest areas in recent years. Over the last three seasons, it has converted just 31 of its 46 attempts.
In 2010, Houston, though making good on 10 of his 16 attempts, struggled particularly early, missing four of his first six attempts of the season, including a late 40-yard field goal against Washington on Oct. 2. USC wound up losing by a score of 32-31.
As a result, much is expected of Heidari, who was ranked as the No. 2 overall kicker in the class of 2011 by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com.
The Bakersfield, Calif. native, who has shown the ability to put the ball through the uprights from 50 yards out, arrived in the spring and could potentially serve as an upgrade despite his age.
“There’s a lot that goes into being familiar and comfortable with your surroundings,” Baxter said. “[Heidari] being here early has helped a lot.”
Additionally, freshman Kris Albarado, a two-star prospect from Lake Charles, looks to take over punting duties for the recently graduated Harfman, who finished with an average of 41.1 yards per punt.
As a senior at St. Louis High School, Albarado averaged 45.3 yards on 24 punts with a long of 65 yards.

The old adage “defense wins championships” certainly holds true, but after the NCAA ruled USC would not be bowl-eligible for at least another year, a BCS national championship is out of the question.
Experience · Returning for a fifth season, senior Chris Galippo will be the vocal leader on defense playing middle linebacker this year. - Daily Trojan file photo
This, however, has not deterred the players one bit.
“[The NCAA ruling is] something we can’t control and we need to accept what we got,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “They never said we couldn’t win every game, so that’s our goal.”
One year removed from a new coaching staff and the famed Tampa 2 defense, devised by assistant coach Monte Kiffin, USC understands it must get better — a lot better.
Statistically, the Trojans surrendered 400 yards per game, which was the worst mark since the school began keeping track in 1955, and allowed opposing offenses to score almost 27 points per contest, which was the second worst mark in school history.
Another glaring weakness was the failure to stop teams on third down, as USC allowed teams almost a 44 percent conversion rate.
“On defense, we have to improve everywhere,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said at Pac-12 media day. “There’s a lot of areas to address, specifically on our back end, two-minute defense and explosive plays.”
Despite its struggles just a year ago, nine key players, seven of whom were starters, return on defense. Anchoring the secondary will be junior safety T.J. McDonald, who led the team in tackles last year and was named a preseason All-American candidate.
Returning with McDonald in the backfield will be Robey, who started all 13 games at cornerback as a true freshman last year.
“We have a whole new fire to us that we didn’t have in the past,” McDonald said. “We’re motivated and we have a chip on our shoulder, so we’ll be ready to play.”
With McDonald and Robey anchoring the secondary, fifth-year senior linebacker Chris Galippo returns to stabilize a linebacker unit that lost Malcolm Smith and Michael Morgan to the NFL.
Last year, Galippo starred on special teams, but this year, he will be the leader of the front-seven at middle linebacker.
“I mean, obviously, the ‘mic’ linebacker is forced to be the most vocal guy on defense,” Galippo said. “So, it’s a good thing I’m naturally pretty outgoing and loud. But you know, you gotta get everyone lined up and you really have to understand the concepts and the schemes.”
Galippo’s move to middle linebacker allows junior Devon Kennard to play his natural position at defensive end, where he starred in high school. Kennard, along with juniors Wes Horton and Nick Perry, form a talented trio the coaching staff believes can be very special.
“Our defensive line has potential to be a very strong group,” Kiffin said at Pac-12 media day. “As you look at the conference, it’s more important not to have big linebackers, but to have fast defensive ends. With [Devon Kennard], Wes Horton and Nick Perry, that’s three premier defensive ends right there.”
With Kennard, Horton and Perry at the ends, senior defensive tackles DaJohn Harris and Armond Armstead return to form a very experienced group up front.
The front-seven will be looking to improve upon last season, where they allowed 140.5 yards on the ground and 4.4 yards per carry, the worst YPC allowed by a USC defense since 1991.
The coaching staff has focused on stopping the run, putting more pressure on the quarterback and forcing turnovers in the off-season.
“We’ve always emphasized [turnovers],” Galippo said. “But we’ve emphasized it more from a player’s perspective. The leaders are doing a good job of making sure they take initiative, getting strip attempts and running to the football.”
This year, without having to deal with a no-tackling policy in practice and a new defensive system, the team is optimistic.
“We’re getting better and better each day,” Robey said. “We’re getting closer as a unit. It’s an important year for us to see how much work we’ve put in and how much we’ve improved [from last season].”

Suffice to say, 2010 wasn’t a banner year for USC.
Finishing the season at 8-5 overall, the Trojans posted fewer than nine wins for the first time since 2001, during then-coach Pete Carroll’s inaugural season in Los Angeles.
Cream of the crop · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley, a Heisman Trophy candidate, will lead an offensive unit featuring multiple talented tailbacks and wide receivers. He hopes to build on an impressive sophomore campaign in which he threw for 2,791 yards and 26 touchdowns. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Yet, such struggles did not fall at the feet of an offense that ranked No. 26 nationally in total yards per game and No. 37 in points per game, averaging more than four touchdowns a game.
Subsequently, with five returning starters, including junior quarterback Matt Barkley, and a highly regarded incoming recruiting class of 30 freshmen, USC figures to be even more dynamic come Sept. 3 against Minnesota, the team’s season opener.
“We know more about our roster,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Going into the second season is going to really help us figure out where to put everybody into place.”
Though the program has largely attracted negative headlines in the wake of NCAA sanctions levied in June 2010, its mainstay in Barkley, who tossed 26 touchdowns in 2010, once again lines up under center and figures to be among the best nationally.
“He can have one of those seasons like we’ve seen before here with Carson [Palmer], [Matt] Leinart, John David [Booty] and Mark Sanchez,” Kiffin said. “I think Matt [Barkley] is on schedule to be in the Heisman conversation.”
Despite his pedigree, interceptions have proven to be cause for concern — at least in the past. Among Pac-10 quarterbacks in 2010, Barkley’s 12 interceptions were the second highest, behind Washington State’s Jeff Tuel, who threw 16. And in the previous season, as a freshman, he threw 14 interceptions in comparison to just 15 touchdowns.
“I just need to move the ball and be efficient,” Barkley said. “We have a ton of skill guys. I’m not going to try and be Superman and force things because we have athletes who can do that.”
And the Trojans, unquestionably, have athletes.
Highlighting arguably the Pac-12’s deepest receiving core is sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who earned Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors a year ago after hauling in 65 catches for 792 yards and six touchdowns. Woods isn’t alone.
A flurry of wideouts, freshmen George Farmer and Kyle Prater, as well as junior Brice Butler, have all been either five-or-four-star prospects coming out of high school. Largely unproven, yes, but talented nonetheless.
“I have quite the arsenal at my disposal this year,” Barkley said with a widening grin. “We have all this skill, but I think we’ll finally turn that into production. We have a special group on our hands.”
Similarly, the team’s tailbacks are equally talented but, following the indefinite suspension of senior tailback Marc Tyler after comments made in a TMZ video in mid-July, are inexperienced as well.
Of the team’s three primary returners sophomore Dillon Baxter, junior Curtis McNeal and freshman D.J. Morgan, only Baxter logged carries in 2010, as McNeal was academically ineligible and Morgan missed the entire season after undergoing surgery for a torn ACL.
 
As a result, the team has relied heavily on freshman Amir Carlisle so far during fall camp.
“Amir’s standing out,” Kiffin said earlier this month. “We don’t have any issues about playing freshmen if they’re the best guy.”
Though depth might not be a factor on the perimeter, in the trenches at least there appear to be some serious concerns regarding depth and experience.
Junior center Khaled Holmes and junior left tackle Matt Kalil are the only two returning starters from last season, and Holmes is already moving from right guard to center.
“A lot of those new guys are going to have to be plugged in,” Kiffin said.
As a result, the offensive line could be rounded out by a particularly young group with junior Jeremy Galten at right guard, sophomore Kevin Graf at right tackle and sophomore John Martinez at left guard. If injuries pile up, incoming freshman Aundrey Walker could also be plugged in at right guard or right tackle.
Nonetheless, with Barkley taking snaps and a ton of offensive weapons still on the roster, the Trojans — at least now — insist they can take the next step in a highly competitive Pac-12.
“Ultimately it’s about wins and losses,” Barkley said. “We had a couple of losses that year riding the line.  I think by reversing those and winning more games this year, we’ll be set.”
Because of a two-year postseason ban, the Trojans will not be able to participate in the conference’s inaugural championship game should they finish first in the South division.
Despite being sanctioned, USC was picked to win the division in the annual preseason media poll.
This could be the best team since Turd roamed the sidelines with Coaching Master McKay.  I can’t wait for that opening kickoff.  Our guys are pumped and focused.  It will be a beautiful, exciting season.
Wait, what did Barkley say in that TMZ video?
Let me guess – something to the effect of “ucla sucks?”

As culturally diverse as USC’s student body is, many students fail to recognize and appreciate the international food court located just across the street from USC’s campus, on Hoover Street and Jefferson Boulevard.
Food court · The University Village’s wide selection of food shops offer students and customers alike top-notch, multicultural repasts. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Hidden within the shabby depths of the University Village is a treasure trove of delicious and affordable eateries. The selections are endless, as the U.V.’s international food court has an assemblage of restaurants, which all have their own expansive menus.
Take advantage of the U.V.’s food court, as USC will soon start to renovate the U.V. and neighboring university-owned property — expect some of the eateries to vacate circa 2013.
These are among the hidden treats found a five-minute walk away:
Nahm San
Located in the middle of the food court is Nahm San, a luncheonette that serves traditional Korean barbecue in vast quantities and reasonable prices.
The Bibimbap combo not only comes with a superb rendition of the signature Korean dish, but also comes with a small side of soup and veggies. The bibimbap’s vegetables are fresh and crunchy, and the meat options are all tenderly delicious. With the option of adding an egg and Nahm San’s special gochujang, this bibimbap is a surefire hit.
Nahm San also offers tantalizing dishes with its chicken and beef, fried egg and spicy beef noodle soup dishes.
Thai Trio
Next to Nahm San is Thai Trio. As the name implies, Thai Trio serves its own respective array of customary Thai repasts.
If you are looking for a good noodle dish, try Thai Trio’s Pad See Ew — with chicken, shrimp or both. Thai Trio’s kitchen does an excellent job of preparing the rice noodles, and the Chinese broccoli and chicken combination successfully complements the noodles, rounding out the dish to create a meal that is truly sufficient for the stomach and satisfying for the palette.
Thai Trio also has great crispy, crunchy egg rolls that are worth a try, and, while you’re there, don’t forget to try the Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee — both are superb-yet-unique drinks.
Corcovado
One of the U.V.’s newer food joints is Corcovado, a Brazilian grill that serves a gallimaufry of meat skewers and veggie-oriented sides.
Corcovado charges by the pound. It would behoove students to be conscientious of this when perusing the vast, buffet-style assortment of victuals; it is easy to get carried away.
The chicken breast wrapped in bacon is an utter delight with its crispy exterior and succulent interior, but if you want to be more daring, try the Brazilian sausage, as it will most assuredly be a new experience.
If you like Corcovado, pick up one of its meal cards. After 10 meals, you get one pound of meat for free.
Manna
Back to the Oriental hub of the food court — amid Thai Trio and Nahm San — is Manna, a sushi bar that offers fresh and delectable Japanese cuisine.
Like Nahm San, Manna has multiple options that supply a lot of food for affordable prices. One of the best frugal-but-appetizing options on the menu is the Salmon Plate, which comes with fresh  grilled teriyaki salmon, vegetable brochette, Asian coleslaw, tossed green salad and a small side of rice.
Manna offers the same plate with teriyaki chicken and has a wide variety of sushi rolls, including the notorious Dragon Roll.
Sandwich Island
If you aren’t in the mood for international cuisine, the U.V. also has an American deli counter that serves home-style sandwiches.
Situated near the back entrance of the food court is Sandwich Island, a family-run, classier version of Subway. Unlike Subway, Sandwich Island has meat, fish, fruits and vegetables that redefine “eating fresh.”
The service is also something to brag about, compared to the monotonous, conveyer-belt-like experience you get at the Subway just around the corner.
There are no limits with Sandwich Island; anything on its menu is subject to your own, personal experimentation. Try a pastrami sandwich topped with melted Swiss cheese and jalapeños, or perhaps a tuna sandwich with crisp tomatoes and lettuce.
The U.V.’s food court is also home to Kabob Master (Mediterranean), Cilantro (Mexican), Taste of India (Indian), Health Hut (Salads), Mongo Fresh (Mongolian), Viztango Café (Italian), Bamboo Express (Chinese) and a Boba teahouse.

Located in the heart of South Los Angeles is USC’s expansive, private-yet-integrated campus, a beloved, didactic home to almost 40,000 students. USC, a school that stands as a miniature facsimile of the vast metropolis that surrounds it, also stands as one of the fountainheads of international education.
Main stage · Bovard Auditorium, home of USC’s Visions and Voices program, will offer a plethora of multicultural performances and presentations throughout the Fall semester — many of which are free with student ID. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Filled with various ethnic groups, cultures and languages, Los Angeles is a bustling hub of multiculturalism that never fails to offer its residents a generous smorgasbord of multicultural satisfaction.
Much like Los Angeles, USC is a cultural mosaic, as it, too, is a more condensed haven for international immigrants and their respective cultures. Around campus, it is not difficult to notice and feel the multiculturalism that pervades USC’s dining halls, food courts, dorms, classrooms and curriculum, media-outlets, faculty and alumni that are all present on campus any given day.
What makes USC’s cultural mosaic possible is the university’s ability to support international cultures — that is, cultures that exist between two or more nations. At USC, it is the allure, exoticism and mystique of certain cultures (Thai, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, etc.) that allow them to coexist, rather than assimilate to the sometimes-overwhelming sense of American patriotism that is also easily noticeable on campus.
USC’s renowned multiculturalism effected international and cultural diversity over past decades, and this year specifically. USC’s freshman class is making its university debut as the most internationally diverse class in the history of the Trojan tradition.
A strong multicultural presence on a campus like as USC creates a vast number of niches that can be explored in various arenas, including extracurricular clubs and fraternities, some of which focus on particular cultures or demographics, such as the Multi/Interracial College Students and Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc. International food courts on and off campus are examples of international gastronomy making itself known at USC. And in the classroom, not only will students meet and interact with fellow pupils from other countries and cultures, but students will also have the chance to enroll in international or cultural-oriented classes. These are just a few of the ways USC has been serving students as a pioneering multicultural university for many years.
Some aspects of USC’s diverse student population are hard to ignore. This can either make it easy for new students to find their place at USC, as there are a near-infinite number of cultural gems, outlets and activities to discover and get involved with, or, such an immense diversity can make students feel even more lost, in an ever-growing sea of concentrated cultures that can be sensory overload. After all, USC is a lot to take in, especially if you are unfamiliar with Los Angeles.
With cultural stimuli bombarding the student body’s senses, it is imperative to recognize and to take advantage of the most influential aspects of culture at USC and the platforms through which culture makes itself readily available to students. This upcoming semester new and returning students can look forward to an influx of exceptional international artists, concerts, video games, restaurants, classes and productions at USC.
For the fall semester, and throughout the year, Visions and Voices will put on a number of exciting international-themed presentations, such as Pika Pika. There will be myriad foreign films released, many of which will be screened at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts (typically free with reservation and student ID). And although the University Village, across the street on Jefferson Boulevard, will start renovating circa 2013 (as part of USC’s strategic plan), there is still ample time to indulge in the international food courts, some new and some old, that serve traditional, foreign cuisine.
Culture is what makes USC what it is, a snapshot of Los Angeles or Los Angeles’ salad-bowl-type concoction of heterogeneous ingredients in the form of multiculturalism; our school is a diverse community of brilliant individuals coming to learn, grow and achieve — the gateway to the real world, be it for a student from Sri Lanka or a student from Pasadena.

With the school year starting again, most students are leaving home and traveling long distances to reach Los Angeles and USC. But for students who make up the university’s ever-growing international population, that distance is far greater, making it even more difficult to stay in touch with family and friends.
Worldwide · Social networking tools like facebook allow students, parents and friends from around the globe to stay interconnected. - Photo illustration by Carlo Acenas
In today’s world, however, keeping in contact with friends is a lot easier thanks to the Internet. Instead of dealing with calling and long distance rates or waiting multiple days via snail mail, students use social media. It’s quick, it’s easy and it’s far cheaper than once-traditional methods.
Blogs, social networking sites and video chat programs can give instant updates on life at college and at home.
Batuhan Akdeniz, a junior industrial and systems engineering major from Istanbul, Turkey, said social media helps him stay aware of current events in his home country, even when he is thousands of miles away.
“[My friends and I] usually talk about the soccer game results and when someone shares a funny video or something important that is happening in Turkey,” he said. “It is weird that we learn [news] before even some people in Turkey.”
There are problems, however, when it comes to using social media. Although college students are more than skilled with tools like Facebook or Skype, that does not mean others, especially older family members, are as adept.
Emilie Mateu, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, has struggled with technical difficulties.
“My whole dad’s side is from France and they are all still over there,” Mateu said. “They are from a really small, old fashioned town and being from a much older generation, my grandparents aren’t familiar with computers, Skype, Facebook, etcetera.”
But even with technology knowledge gaps, social media still makes communication easier, and for many students, can help them share their lives at college as it happens.
“[My family and I] used to talk to them about once a week by phone but a computer has completely changed the way we keep in touch — which has been great for them,” Mateu said. “They can kind of get a glimpse of the parts of our lives that they aren’t here for.”
Aside from international-based students, there are also a handful of students that study abroad and encounter similar problems. Melinda Amato, a senior studying sociology, is spending the fall semester in Chile. She had to work with her friends and family to set up communication before she left, and is using more than just chat programs to share her
experiences.
“My grandmother does not have a computer but she goes over to my aunt’s house so she can Skype me from there,” she said. “My friends and I set specific times to Skype in advance. I also keep a blog so that I can have all my stories and pictures in one place for my friends and family.”
Not all students come from countries where familiar Western social media sites are available, and even if they are, they might be heavily censored by the country’s government, or blocked altogether.
Youli Zheng, a junior majoring in communication, has to deal with such censorship to talk to her family in China.
“Most social media sites in the States — Facebook and Twitter — are blocked in China,” Zheng said. “I usually just use Chinese version of these sites to follow what my friends back home have been doing.”
Of course, busy class schedules and time zone differences can make reaching out to people overseas difficult, but not impossible. For some, like Mateu, the difference isn’t so big as to limit the amount of time they can talk with friends, but for others it can cause some problems.
Akdeniz found himself somewhat limited thanks to the time zone.
“I video chat with my family once a week because of the time difference, which is 10 hours,” Akdeniz said. “It is mostly in the mornings or very late at night.”
Using social media is not the same as being in a room, interacting face-to-face with a friend or family member, but it is close. And the tools involved to chat with people around the world are getting easier to use, which is good news for USC students and families alike.

College is full of new experiences and, for some students, that includes cooking. Students stuck in dorms might think they are limited to Everybody’s Kitchen and Carl’s Jr., but plenty of tasty, healthy meals can be made from the comfort of every student’s microwave —  without the help of Lean Cuisine or Stouffer’s.
Those who can’t boil water, much less in a microwave, read on for a crash course in becoming a dorm room top chef.
 
Curry in a Mega Hurry
Adapted from The Food Network.
Ingredients
• 2 chicken breasts or 4 chicken thighs, cut into large cubes (replace with garbanzo beans for a veggie option, but cut cooking time by 3/4)
• 1 1/2 tablespoons butter or cooking oil (extra virgin coconut is even better)
• 1 tablespoon curry paste
• 1/4 bunch of cilantro
• 1/2 medium onion, sliced
• Salt and pepper (to taste)
• 2 tablespoons chicken broth or water with powdered chicken flavor
• 1/4 teaspoon curry powder (optional)
• 1 can coconut milk (optional for a wetter curry)
• 1 Ziploc steam bag (optional)
Add curry paste and butter /oil to a large bowl or steamer bag. Microwave for 30 seconds, until the paste and oil have melted.
Add all ingredients except for cilantro and optional coconut milk. If using a bowl, cover in Saran wrap. Cook on medium for eight minutes or on high for six. Medium is better but not all microwaves have that option.
If using a bowl, add coconut milk (optional) and cilantro. If using a bag and coconut milk, remove chicken from the bag and place in a large bowl with the coconut milk and cilantro.
Microwave another two to four minutes. Check chicken to be sure it’s no longer pink (salmonella is not a fun reason for missing class).
Let set for two minutes before taking out. Serve over rice with some veggies.
Serves two.
Italian Egg Scramble
Ingredients
• 2 eggs or 1/2 cup liquid eggs (like Reddi Whites)
• 3 pepperonis or 1 pre-cooked Italian sausage
• Pinch each of basil, oregano and thyme, or an Italian-blend spice mix
• Salt and pepper (to taste)
• 2 tablespoons pasta sauce
• A handful of your favorite veggies, such as red bell peppers, onion, broccoli or spinach
• 2-3 teaspoons cheese, preferably parmesan
 
Take a coffee mug or bowl and spray with non-stick cooking spray, or grease with some melted butter or cooking oil.
Add all ingredients except for the pasta sauce and parmesan. Microwave for 45 seconds.
Remove and stir. Microwave for another 45 seconds.
Remove and scoop out onto a plate. Break up with a spoon if desired, and top with sauce and cheese.
Serves one.
Blitzed Bibimbap
Ingredients
• 1 serving of microwave rice
• Handful of each of the following (it’s OK if you do not have all of them): matchstick carrots, spinach, shitake mushrooms, bean sprouts
• 2-3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
• 1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)
• Soy sauce (to taste)
• 1 soft-boiled egg or poached egg
• A dollop of gochujang  (a spicy and sweet Korean chili paste found in Asian grocery stores)
 
If you have a microwave egg cooker, cook egg. If not, hold off on the egg.
Prepare rice according to instructions on package. Place a serving in a good-sized bowl. Cover to keep warm.
If you prefer cooked vegetables, add veggies to a bowl drizzled with sesame oil. Microwave for about 45 seconds. Skip this step if you prefer raw vegetables.
If not using an egg cooker, take a glass and fill with water. Add a little vinegar and a pinch of salt. Crack open and add the egg, careful not to break the yoke. Gently pierce the yoke (don’t tear) with the tine of a fork. Microwave one minute. Immediately remove and place on some paper towels to dry.
Add vegetables to the rice bowl, drizzle with any remaining sesame oil and add soy sauce and gochujang to taste. Add egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Dig in with a spoon.
Serves one.
