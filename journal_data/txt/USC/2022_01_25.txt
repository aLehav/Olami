USC will establish an Advisory Committee of Jewish Life and ensure Jewish representation in the University’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, President Carol Folt announced in a Jan. 13 email to the “USC Jewish community and supporters.”
The announcement follows months of faculty open letters, accusations of antisemitism and “racial & ethnic harassment” toward a Palestinian student that highlights persistent conflict on college campuses across the country, including navigating free speech issues, protecting students with various identities and disputes surrounding Israel and Palestine. 
At USC, the most recent controversy stems from civil engineering major Yasmeen Mashayekh’s tweets last spring and summer that included statements such as “I want to kill every motherfucking Zionist,” “I fucking love hamas” and “yel3an el yahood,” — which directly translates to “curse the Jews” — though Mashayekh later on Twitter said she referred to the “apartheid regime” and that yel3an means a “request for God to cast judgment,” rather than “curse.”
Mashayekh deleted the tweets before the beginning of the fall semester, but they came onto professors’ radars in late November after outside organizations, such as Canary Mission, shared screenshots. At that time, the University had not yet publicly addressed the tweets. 
More than 60 faculty members signed an open letter Dec. 1 addressed to Folt, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski and Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso, demanding the University “publicly and explicitly rebuke” Mashayekh’s tweets and writing that unrebuked expressions of antisemitism and zionophobia on campus are “alienating, hurtful, and depressing.” 
Mashayekh and online supporters circulated a letter addressed to Folt and Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos on Dec. 2, writing that “the language of the oppressed towards their oppressor is a form of personal resistance” against “colonial violence,” and urging the University to “stand in support of an oppressed student.”
In a Dec. 3 response to the faculty open letter, Folt and Zukoski wrote that the University discovered Mashayekh’s tweets over the summer and subsequently removed her from a Viterbi paid mentoring position. They also wrote that Mashayekh is not a “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Senator” as the faculty letter suggests, and that she is instead a DEI Senator of the Viterbi Graduate Student Association, a student elected position.
Since Dec. 3, University officials — from Folt and Zukoski to Caruso — have released a total of eight statements condemning antisemitism on campus located on the “We are SC” website under a new tab published Dec. 31 titled “Addressing Antisemitism.” The first four messages respond to the Dec. 1 letter, the next two address USC’s inclusion in the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s “Anti-Semitic 2021 Top Ten List” and the last two discuss the University’s new initiatives dedicated to combating antisemitism.
Critical of the University’s response, lack of support
In an interview with the Daily Trojan Jan. 6, Folt said the University is dedicated to supporting the campus’ Jewish community, citing the new Jewish Life advisory committee and conversations with USC Hillel. She also said that many of the demands she’s received about social media posts have come from outside sources who “don’t really know what it’s like on our campus,” rather than students.
Mashayekh wrote on Twitter that she and her family have received death threats as a result of online harassment, as well as an FBI visit.
“Today my mom received a phone call from someone threatening to kill me, her and my entire family because of my tweets; the person claimed to know where I live. I do not feel safe on campus. This school has done nothing but cater to my oppressor,” wrote Mashayekh in a Dec. 14 Tweet.
Mashayekh did not respond to multiple interview requests from the Daily Trojan.
Emad Askar, who graduated from USC in 2021 and is a past member of Students for Justice in Palestine, said the University has not properly supported Palestinian students, nor allowed for their recognition on campus. To Askar, it is “preposterous” that a girl tweeting “I want to kill Zionists” is inappropriate. 
“You have every right as an oppressed group to violently rebel against your oppressor,” Askar said.
To the professors who penned the letter, the initial University response to Mashayekh’s tweets did not move beyond empty statements and platitudes, failing to address “hate speech” that they said makes some Jewish students feel unsafe on campus.
“You address hate speech with a speech that debunks it, that tells that ‘No, we don’t want to kill all Zionist students,’ and Zionist students are welcome on campus,” said Hanna Reisler, a chemistry professor. “We didn’t hear it. That has not been yet articulated.”
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Reisler wrote that she will now serve on the new advisory committee of Jewish Life. 
Jacob Miller, a senior majoring in biochemistry and co-president of USC Hillel, said that, while he generally feels supported as a Jewish student on campus, he’s experienced “microaggressions” in classrooms and that “current instances on social media” made him feel unsafe on campus.
“I think when these things happen, it’s really hurtful as a Jewish student, and, oftentimes, students feel unsafe on campus,” Miller said.  
Addressing concerns about the University’s inadequate support of Palestinian students, Folt said “it’s a real problem if we try to put those in opposition.”
“I think someone can be very strongly wanting to have non-antisemitic behavior and very strongly not wanting Islamophobic behavior, and I absolutely believe most people are there,” Folt said. “We don’t want to be a part of a narrative that creates those as opposition.”
Askar, though, said that framing the issue as a “conflict” falsely implies that Zionist students equally struggle on campus when they have the “overwhelming support of the school [and] of the United States.”
While a student at USC, Askar said he unsuccessfully petitioned to hang a Palestinian flag outside the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs, which, to him, showed the lack of recognition Palestinian students receive from USC administration.
“[University administration] will cut off any progress by not even letting there be the representation of putting a piece of cloth on a building that people, half the time, don’t even look up and notice,” Askar said. “But it means that much to us because we’ve gotten so little in our life.”Not an isolated incident
The University has dealt with controversy surrounding Israel and Palestine before the outcry that followed Mashayekh’s tweets. Last May, the Gender Studies Department endorsed a statement on Solidarity with Palestinian Feminist Collective calling for “feminists everywhere to speak up, organize, and join the struggle for Palestinian liberation.” 
On Aug. 8, a similar group of professors published an open letter to Folt, Caruso and Zukoski that expressed “objection and dismay” at the department’s “one-sided position” on a “complex issue as the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.”
Department chair for the Gender Studies Department Karen Tongson wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan Aug. 26 that the department’s endorsement “came with the consent of a clear majority of individual faculty members exercising their academic freedom,” and is not a reflection of the University’s views. In Summer 2020, former Undergraduate Student Government vice president Rose Ritch’s resignation followed allegations of complicity with former USG President Truman Fritz’s history of racial misconduct and microaggressions. 
After Ritch said she faced harassment because of her Zionist identity, Folt released a message Aug. 6 condemning antisemetism on campus and attacks against Ritch’s “Zionist identities.” Faculty penned an open letter in support of Rose and Zionist students Aug. 30.  
The student who pushed for Ritch’s impeachment, Abeer Tijani, faced online harassment from similar outside sources such as StopAntisemetism.org. Dean of Religious and Spiritual Life Varun Soni and former Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp wrote a letter Aug. 24 condemning “online hate and harassment” that targeted “Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Black, and other students.”
During that summer, USG senator Isabel Washington also resigned after her past anti-Palestinian comments such as “IF YOUR BITCH I[S] FROM PALESTINE I PULL UP IN MY TANK” and “Imagine being pro palestine lmfao” surfaced. Nathaniel Manor, who would have succeeded Washington after her resignation, did not because of similar anti-Palestinian rhetoric on his TikTok.    
Dedicating resources and moving forward
Amr Shabaik, the civil rights managing attorney at the Council on American-Islamic Relations Los Angeles — an organization that wrote a 2020 letter to Folt because of a “conflation between anti-Zionism and antisemitism” in her letter regarding Ritch’s resignation — said that antisemitism, Islamophobia and harassment against Palestinian students are all “very real issues” that need to be addressed. 
However, more resources are often devoted to combating antisemitism than to Islamophobia and preventing the harassment of Palestinian students, who are often targeted online as a result of their advocacy, Shabaik said. 
“It’s important for schools to recognize that. To recognize the real harassment and discrimination,” said Shabaik in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “To make sure and ensure that those students feel like they have a place where they will be protected, and won’t be forced to deal with outside pressures, or to deal with issues that could affect their livelihood or their careers or their safety.”
To address both antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus, Folt said she tasked Soni with creating a working group to submit a report with concrete recommendations on addressing those two issues last January. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Soni said the recommendations include creating kosher and halal food stations in dining halls, adding antisemitism and Islamophiaba training modules to student orientations, reviewing holy day policies to better accommodate students and hiring additional staff to oversee Muslim and Jewish life. The group is currently working on implementing those recommendations, he said. 
The recommendations also found that “so much” of what students consider antisemitic or Islamophobic on campus stems from the “Israel Palestine debate,” Soni said. Social media and student privacy laws, as well as diverse opinions within each community, further complicate these issues, which, Soni said, extend beyond USC. 
“It’s not a USC challenge. These are global challenges,” Soni said. “These are national challenges, and they’re reflected on virtually every college campus and university campus in the country.”Bella Durgin-Johnson contributed to this report.

The new year brings many things — one of them being new music from the artists we love. Despite not even being a month into 2022, everyone from Halsey to Mitski have fed us well with a plethora of tracks to satisfy our tastes. 
“People disappear here” – Halsey 
Freshly into 2022, American singer-songwriter Halsey kicked off the year by releasing an extended version of their album, “If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power.” With an original, one-of-a-kind film experience of the same name that is currently streaming on HBO Max, they have certainly cemented themselves as one of the most bold and innovative artists in pop music today.
Although the original album was released last August, this new edition features two additional tracks, titled “People disappear here” and “Nightmare – Reprise,” for a total of 16 songs. The former is hauntingly beautiful, juxtaposing a steady drumline with soft, lyrically intense vocals per Halsey’s unique, individualistic style. 
“Watercolor Eyes” (From “Euphoria” An HBO Max Original Series) – Lana Del Rey
Lana Del Rey’s delicate and sensitive, moody yet steady, and above all else — ethereal — new single appears on the soundtrack for critically-acclaimed television series “Euphoria”’s second season.
Similar to the artist’s other tracks, this song sounds wistful and reflective with lyrics such as “Your love stings like blood and a lemon / Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?” I found the beat drop in the pre-chorus along with the lyrics to follow, “Young love don’t always last forever / Wild horses can’t keep us together,” to be especially captivating. Overall, the song’s unique and gentle sound makes it a worthwhile listen. 
“Jigsaw” – Conan Gray
Gen Z pop sensation Conan Gray rang in the year with a new solo titled “Jigsaw,” and the contrasting elements of the song fit together like a puzzle. Gray is no stranger to giving the audience something completely different, yet equally wonderful, with iconic previous tracks such as “Heather” and “Maniac.” This new release also follows a similar formula, mixing jarring metallic sounds and bright electric guitar for effective, seamless transitions. Gray makes it work, and that experimentation is what makes the three-minute song special. 
“Rhapsody – Wild: 7 Virtuoso Etudes After Gershwin: No. 4, Embraceable You” – Martin James Bartlett 
Whether you’re a genuine classical music admirer or just turn to it for background music while studying, British classical pianist Martin James Bartlett’s recording of Earl Wild’s “Virtuoso Etudes After Gershwin: No.4, Embraceable You,” written based on George Gershwin’s composition of the same name, is a must-not-miss piece. As the keys of the piano are pressed, one can feel the delicacy with which Bartlett plays. The recording’s smooth dynamic shifts and discernible harmonies make for a beautiful song. 
“It’s All Coming Back To Me Now” – Céline Dion
Yes, this list is meant to highlight more recent releases of music, and yes, Céline Dion’s rendition of the famous ballad (first recorded by girl group Pandora’s Box) was released in 1996, which would certainly classify it as not recent. However, this heart-wrenching ballad has once again become popularized due to TikTok, where content from talented covers to dramatic yet amusing reenactments of the chorus are bound to pop up within a few scrolls on your For You page.
This isn’t the first time that TikTok has revived a song for a new generation of listeners — rock song “Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)” released by Edison Lighthouse in 1970 has also picked up a new group of listeners thanks to the social media powerhouse. Countless oldies have been revived thanks to TikTok’s reach, which is certainly a positive aspect of the app’s popularity. If you didn’t get a chance to listen to “It’s All Coming Back To Me Now” in 1996, now is the time to give Dion’s powerful and breathtaking vocal range a listen or two. 
“Love Me More” – Mitski
The term “Laurel Hell” hails from the Southern Appalachians in the United States, referring to areas where laurel bushes grow into wide, dense thickets. It also happens to be the title of the upcoming sixth studio album scheduled for release on Feb. 4 by Japanese American indie rock musician Mitski.
Four singles from this upcoming album were released in early January, including “Love Me More,” “Heat Lightning,” “The Only Heartbreaker” and “Working for the Knife.” Each song sounds more precise and vulnerable than the last, so much so that I’ve found myself consistently increasing the volume while listening. Feeling the emotion in her voice, I have to keep checking the decibel count on my headphones to make sure that Mitski and I aren’t barreling toward eventual hearing damage. My personal favorite is “Heat Lightning,” but all four tracks are definitely worth a listen.

Dylan J. Locke was inspired to establish a theatre company dedicated to uplifting creative, multicultural students after a formative conversation with a friend in the dining hall freshman year. 
When discussing a recent audition, Locke’s friend expressed concern about not being cast in her dream role since she was an underrepresented minority in the arts. The director, producer, choreographer and every other high-powered position in the School of Dramatic Arts production was white, so she felt unsure how she would fit into their vision and as it turns out, she didn’t. 
“The only people of color who got into the play were in the ensemble, and I think that was the moment when I said, ‘Why not us? Why can’t we create the opportunities for ourselves instead of waiting for permission?’” said Locke, a 2021 graduate who majored in theatre.
In 2018, he established Modern Minority Theatre Co., SDA’s newest independent student production company. Its purpose is to empower marginalized, creative voices within the student population.
What started as a group of only a couple of students has grown into a successful and influential organization with over a dozen involved executive members. At its various community events, Modern Minority Theatre often hosts over 100 attendees.
The club organizes conversations with guest speakers from the industry, student panels, film festivals, songwriting workshops and more, all promoting the inclusion of Black, Indigenous and people of color in the performing arts. 
“Through our full-length productions, play readings, and community events, we strive to build an affinity group for minority artists and those passionate about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the entertainment industry,” according to the group’s website. 
Jeniffer Velazquez, a junior majoring in theatre and political science, met Locke at her freshman year involvement fair and immediately knew she wanted to be involved in Modern Minority Theatre. 
“As a Latina woman who had come from this predominantly white high school, it was something that was really interesting to me and something that I was definitely seeking,” Velazquez said. 
As a new member of Modern Minority Theatre, in 2019, she participated in their show, “Water by the Spoonful,” and has since become the organization’s graphics chair, running its social media pages.
“I would say that this has been my homebase club on campus. Especially as a student in SDA, I feel like everyone has their homebase independent student company,” Velazquez said. “The best thing is that all the people there are equally as passionate about this issue as I am.” 
Arie Abija, a senior majoring in theatre production, is Modern Minority Theatre’s current president. Ironically, looking toward the future, Abija actually hopes for the organization’s dissolution. 
“Oddly enough, I feel like my ultimate desire for the club is that it wouldn’t be necessary. Hypothetically, it would need to dissolve because all of the underrepresented groups would be represented fairly,” Abija said.
Locke agrees with this long-term goal and supports the idea that Modern Minority Theatre was founded in hopes of eventually disbanding the organization. 
“The goal for Modern Minority when I was there was always that if we could reach our own obsolescence, that would be the most amazing thing ever,” Locke said. “Where an organization dedicated to empowering artists of color was not needed but existed as a really nice conscious community but not necessarily on a student organization level.” 
In the short term, though, Modern Minority Theatre is thriving and actively planning for this upcoming year. This semester, the group is looking forward to its 24-hour Theatre Festival, where students will write and perform plays in one day, in February and Songwriter Showcase in April. The Songwriter Showcase is a collaboration with another student company, Off the Record, which elevates marginalized voices in musical theatre. 
“It’s the only club that I’m involved in that has people from a lot of different backgrounds, not just specifically one minority group or one affinity group … I feel like I’ve learned so much and had my perspective changed with so many things because I’m just around all these different people,” Abija said.

I have come to terms with a cruel reality: A column talking about issues pertaining to older adults in a publication geared toward college-aged individuals presents issues of irrelevancy.
While I contemplated this when pitching my column three semesters ago, I found it reasonable to simply give it a try — what’s the worst that could happen? 
Well, for one, nobody reading the column in the first place was probably an issue that should have been seen in hindsight, and certainly, my responsibilities for editing articles and now managing new columnist applications certainly do not help that journalistic imposter syndrome. 
There are plenty of rising and returning columnists who may make much better use of this space I’m currently occupying on whatever media you use to consume the Daily Trojan. Not that I’m necessarily being ousted out of this position, but maybe I’m just a bit too old school for the Dr. Blingspices, Eck’s Factors and Trojan Psyches that hold the spot for your favorite column. 
The gerontologist in me winces at the very thought of this column ending. However, it seems only fitting now to analyze my thought process as we discuss retirement on a much more grandiose scale — rather than from just a college column. 
Retirement can be an incredibly daunting and misconstrued word. In a seemingly good context, many people wish to retire early, leaving their work behind usually because of financial freedom. On the other hand, retirement often gets thrown around in the aging world as people become older and either save enough money to retire or are forced to retire. 
The recent pandemic, however, has forced many into an early retirement given the constraints on health and financial amenities. 
Regardless, let’s just focus on the attitude toward older people retiring at this point in time instead of the what-ifs — as my brain would say after breaking up with my ex. Retiring this column partly resembles some of the thoughts that many older people may feel as we enter the third year of the pandemic and deal with a major labor crisis. 
Some older adults may feel pushed out by employers who hold younger, more tech-savvy applicants in higher regard. Some may feel that their position has changed to not value their skillset but rather solely rely on their experience, becoming more of a sage mentor that’ll eventually be ousted off the show to let the main character thrive. 
Many companies may push diversity, equity and inclusion programs but fail to consider how age in the workplace can play a role in improving workplace chemistry or provide value to the quality of work. Especially considering the remote office, minor tech problems may be seen as incompetency or the inability to learn from the end of an employer. Therefore, retirement from that perspective looks like you’re being shipped off in a casket, being told that your body or skill set are no longer valued. 
These feelings of being disposable or replaceable are also not limited to old age. Without getting incredibly sentimental, those feelings can last entire lifetimes, especially for those who may feel like they aren’t contributing enough or experiencing imposter syndrome. Certainly, I do not want to come off as if I am asking for the retirement age to be pushed to beyond triple digits. Rather, I implore you to holistically look at this period of “retirement” as what many people may already see it as: an opportunity to relax and pick up new hobbies. Regardless, some older adults continue to work or volunteer into their late 80s and 90s, actively engaging with members of their local community. 
As college students, the nature of the hustle and grind culture perpetuated by social media and age-based stereotypes (getting married, having kids, planning to retire at specific ages) beats us down. We want to retire early because it feels like we’ve won the rat race that is part of the capitalist machine. If we retire late, we may see it as finishing last in a race or even developing a sense of FOMO from being unable to do what our friends or idols do at a certain age. Tearing apart the stereotype that working into old age translates to you screwing up at the beginning or tripping along the way encourages older people to return to the workplace as well. 
I’ll pop off my soapbox one last time. But before I forget, I’ll just combine my usual quirks into this last part. When you, the inquisitive reader, read this column for what it’s worth — thank you, by the way — ask yourself, “What do I want to reflect back on when I say, ‘Back in my day…’?”
Lois Angelo is a junior writing about the intersections of gerontology and social issues in his column, “Back in My Day.” He is also the managing editor at the Daily Trojan.

For most, Jan. 1 is the epitome of a fresh start — “new year, new me” — a phrase routinely hashed out during the first weeks of the year, demonstrating the ambitious strides many take for self-improvement. Whether that be exercising, maintaining healthy relationships or stopping procrastination, many people approach the new year with aspirations for change. 
New Year’s resolutions serve as an ideal starting point for many who want a clean slate, and what better way to track progress than starting on day one? But instead of placing emphasis on the new year and associating January with extreme improvement, we should encourage a culture of steady betterment regardless of the date. 
A prime example of this is the aim to become healthier through exercise or weight loss, which tops the chart for one of the most popular goals Americans hold every year, according to a study conducted by Finder. What starts, for many, as drastic alterations to current lifestyles for quick results can turn into a slippery slope of burnout that culminates in complete abandonment of the resolution. 
Many of these goals are intrinsically tied to our identity as students and the collegiate lifestyle. We often lose weight or exercise to improve our appearance in order to impress our peers, or set up study methods for academic-related goals. These goals are intentionally set to help us succeed for the upcoming semester. 
Though these aren’t inherently bad and can actually prove extremely beneficial for self-improvement, following the traditional format of New Year’s resolutions is discouraging in the long run. 
The day most people gave up on their New Year’s resolutions was Jan. 19, according to a survey conducted by Strava, to the point where Strava coined the day as “Quitter’s Day.” With most resolutions lasting only 19 days, the evident problem is that resolutions are not a sustainable form of creating lasting change. 
Instead of placing so much importance and emphasis on their goals from day one, students must allow for bumps in the road. Especially with a whole semester ahead filled with midterms and finals, college students need greater motivators besides caffeine to fuel their goals. 
For many, losing grip on the steam that drove their initial motivation can be extremely demotivating and can leave an individual dissatisfied with what should have been ideally a perfectly clean record in 2022. 
Instead of attempting to stick with extreme habits and repeating “new year, new me,” it should be encouraged to start on our resolutions whenever possible — whether that’s in the middle of the semester or right before finals. 
Achieving perfection is impossible and students should not take extreme measures to stick to their resolutions. The trajectory of growth does not always manifest itself as a linear form, and self-improvement cannot be solely reserved for January. 
With January coming to a close, students should keep this in mind as they begin to pick up pace this upcoming semester. With greater external conflicts such as the continual rage of the pandemic and its variants, we should adopt a more forgiving mindset toward ourselves as we carry on through this perpetual marathon toward betterment.
