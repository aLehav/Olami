A crowd of students watched as Cassandra Davis, a representative of the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, held up two identical jars, one with several moon jellyfish and the other with a plastic bag. Davis said that though humans could tell the two jars apart, on the open ocean it might not be so easy for the sea turtles that may confuse the plastic with their prey.
“They’re going to be drifting along, often in the same currents,” Davis said. “When they are out in the ocean current, they look and act like jellies. It’s easy to see the confusion when you hold them side by side.” 
 The demonstration took place at the Plastic Bag Ban Summit, hosted in the Trojan Ballroom on Wednesday afternoon by the Benioff Ocean Initiative at UC Santa Barbara in conjunction with the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The summit included a panel discussion on the ways plastic waste manifests in the ocean ecosystem and its impact on humans, as well as what actions need to be taken to address the pollution.
The Aquarium of the Pacific is hoping to raise awareness by using the jars to demonstrate just how easy it is for marine life to become confused and ingest plastic. Davis said that even if the sea turtles do not directly eat the plastic, the jellies on which they feed may. The plastic, and the chemicals from it, stay in the system of the jellyfish, then travel up the food chain until they reach the animals at the top.
This makes humans vulnerable as well, Davis said. Most plastic remains in the stomach of fish, posing a threat to people who consume this part of the fish. Furthermore, schooling fish, like sardines, are caught and ground into feed for domesticated animals, making it possible for the plastic contaminants to enter the human body through chicken. 
Jennifer Brandon, a Ph.D. candidate who is researching microplastics through the SCRIPPS Institute of Oceanography, said that one of the biggest misconceptions about plastic waste pollution in the ocean is that it takes the form of a large island of trash in the middle of the ocean. The reality is that garbage patches, which tend to occur at convergence points of major currents, only consist of a few large pieces of plastic waste. The rest is what has been called “microplastic.”
“Most of the plastic in the ocean is very small,” Brandon said. “Ninety percent are smaller than a quarter of an inch, but we started to realize that these pieces are even more dangerous. They are much harder to clean up and much easier to eat.”
Brandon said that an increasing number of bottom-feeders have been found with plastic in their stomachs, which can impact predators at the top of the food chain. Studies conducted by the SCRIPPS Ocean Institute have found that about 34 percent of gooseneck barnacles examined had plastic in their guts. In South America, these organisms are considered a delicacy, creating a direct path for plastic to be ingested by humans.
Other studies have been conducted on copepods, one of the most abundant organisms in the world. In an experimental setting, they have been proven to eat plastic, and Brandon said that because they are one of the key building blocks for the entire oceanic food chain, the implications could be devastating.
According to Brandon, plastic smaller than one-third of a millimeter across escapes most nets, making it difficult to measure how much of it is actually in the ocean. Because of the tendency for plastic to break down into infinitely smaller pieces, it is possible that this form of plastic, called “nanoplastic,” is the most prevalent. 
Roland Geyer, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, said that there are also studies being conducted to determine which countries contribute most to the plastic problem. 
“Out of the top 20 countries, 18 are South Asian,” Geyer said. “This is because they have high a population density along with recent economic development, so they use a lot more plastic, especially in packaging. They also don’t have the infrastructure to deal with plastic waste. It’s the perfect storm.” 
The United States also appears in the top 20, due to its large population and coastal areas. Panelists agreed that California has pioneered the way for increased environmental regulation, inspiring the laws of other states as well as across the globe, but said that issues in combatting plastic pollution still remain. 
For example, plastics are currently manufactured to withstand whatever they are being used for, making it very difficult to dispose of them properly. To address this problem, panelists emphasized that the solution may need to come from the industries that manufacture plastics, rather than relying on the government.
Interesting. But what does ‘summit’ mean? Who was there, and what are they at the top of (except the food chain)?

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanEducational review · U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. held a roundtable discussion about various issues in the educational system at USC Rossier School of Education on Wednesday. afternoon.
U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. visited USC’s Rossier School of Education Wednesday to discuss issues facing the nation’s education system, such as inadequate teacher preparation and lack of diversity,
The roundtable discussion also included Karen Symms Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School of Education, Ted Mitchell, under secretary of education and multiple Los Angeles Unified School District teachers.
The roundtable began with panelists pointing out holes in a federal education bill passed by the Senate on Dec. 9 2015, which gave significant power to states and local districts. While the legislation’s goal was to increase innovation by allowing the local governments to pinpoint issues within their community, many believe that state governments are still not doing enough. For example, King explained that the teachers are often not adequately prepared for the challenges associated with diverse classrooms.
“Historically, information collected with teacher preparation programs has been at a surface level,” King said. “We haven’t necessarily gotten the information that teacher preparation programs need for continuous improvement.” 
Several teachers explained that the main difficulties stem from a broken system of supply and demand. Educators often want to teach in “easier,” or more appealing settings, as they do not have a strong support system or safety net after completing training. 
As a result, public school systems end up lacking teachers willing to teach STEM and higher-level courses, and have an overabundance of teachers willing to teach first through fifth grade. 
Teachers are also less willing to teach in low-income neighborhoods, leading to a deficit of teachers in areas like downtown Los Angeles. 
“We have significant equity gaps around access to effective teachers,” King said. “Too often, it’s our low income students and students of color, our English learners who have the least access to effective teachers even though they need that the most.”
Mitchell said that the Department of Education planned this trip to Los Angeles because California is the most populated state in the country, and he hopes that understanding California’s educational system will help the federal government be more responsive to educational needs in different states.
“We are in California because one in 10 teachers in America teach in the state of the California, so getting it right is a big deal,” Mitchell said. “Not only because of the numbers, but also because America is always being invented day in and day out in the state of California, whether that’s technology, demographics or cultural expression.”
Gallagher said that the Department of Education hopes to further use technology to collect data that will support teachers. She emphasized that data is important because it starts conversations, and when it is sent back to states, governmental organizations are able to be more responsive to state educational needs. 
“We need to have principals. We need to have current teachers working with us so that we get feedback on our students and graduates,” Gallagher said. “And that’s where the data piece is so important. LAUSD and USC have data about the effectiveness of our graduates, and we know what they see we need to do more. Data is a way to start that conversation.”
I am sorry, but I’m going to totally disagree with this “blame inequality” i.e. victimology stuff. This is getting ridiculous and out of hand. 
There is a night & day difference between the culture, attitudes, level of effort, and so on between students in the inner city versus those from the suburb. My friend who subbed for both LAUSD and high schools in the suburb told me about his experience. The students from the inner city do not have the drive, culture, motivation, etc. to want to excel academically. That is not the teacher or administration’s responsibility. The liberal mentality of “everyone is supposed to accommodate me” does not engender character growth.

For anyone looking for mystery, murder, free food and a chance to channel their inner Sherlock Holmes, look no further. Undergraduate Student Government’s Special Events Committee will present a USC Murder Mystery Dinner this Friday in the Trojan Grand Ballroom. 
The Murder Mystery Dinner will be an immersive experience for attendees, similar to a game of Clue. Attendees are asked to dress up in cocktail or Halloween attire to add a sense of realism to the evening as they take on new identities.
The night will begin with mocktails and transition to a complimentary three-course dinner. Throughout the night, various murders will occur and guests will have to work together to figure out who the murderer is by gathering clues. Once the clues are gathered, attendees will have to decide if it was indeed Mr. Green in the study with the candlestick.
“It’s something that has never happened on a large scale at USC before, and it’s a great opportunity for students to socialize and meet new people in an unconventional way,” said Executive Director Gisella Tan. “It is also a fun and a rare opportunity for students to roleplay and dress up.”
SEC has hired a production company called Keith and Margo’s Murder Mystery Dinner, who will have professional undercover actors interacting with the attendees. These hidden actors will facilitate the investigation by interrogating audience members and helping them find clues in order to solve the mystery. 
The company specializes in mysterious dinner theatre. It has worked at weekly dinners, private parties, corporate events and more. Keith and Margo’s Murder Mystery Dinner also offers weekly performances at Matteo’s Restaurant in West L.A. 
The Special Events Committee has organized a variety of events for students, such as the Zombie Run and the Welcome Back Comedy Show. The committee aims to create exciting events for students who are seeking fun beyond conventional events, such as concerts or festivals.
“We really hope students get out of their comfort zone with their new identities and just have a great time,” Tan said. 
SEC’s Murder Mystery Dinner will take place Oct. 14 at 6 p.m. in the Trojan Grand Ballroom. The event is RSVP only, and while the event has reached its maximum capacity, some spots may open up.

As fall comes into full swing, chunkier fashion pieces, such as leather boots and wool sweaters, are being resurrected from closets. Even though Los Angeles weather — which barely drops below 60 degrees at night — doesn’t necessarily insinuate the need to wear thermal garments, keeping up with fall fashion is paramount (to most fashion-savvy Californians). While the quality and warmth of products is vital, wearing dead animal skin as a fashion statement is cruel and harmful. So, here are reasons you should “wear your own skin, not animals” this fall. Special thanks to peta2 for the extensive knowledge I accumulated about the animal skins industries for our Skins campaign this past summer on the Vans Warped Tour. 
In recent years, fur has become less socially accepted. Nevertheless, fur products are still on the market. Before purchasing a fur-trimmed parka, keep in mind that regardless of what the label reads, the jacket could be made out of rabbit, beaver, fox, mink, dog, cat, raccoon fur or any combination of said furs. These animals, among other furry creatures, are killed in the most inhumane ways for their fur, such as neck-breaking or drowning, according to peta2. 
After being skinned for their fur, their carcasses are often dumped into landfills. Aside from the evident animal exploitation, fur is up to 10 times more harmful to the environment to produce than a faux-fur item, according to a 2013 CE Delft (an environmental consultant) study. Additionally, the chemicals used to prevent animals’ flesh from rotting after being turned into a coat or trim are highly toxic and carcinogenic. 
Consider returning your recently purchased leather jacket, purse or belt. Every year, “the global leather industry slaughters more than a billion animals,” according to peta2. Goats, pigs, sheep, lambs, horses, deer, kangaroos, snakes, alligators and elephants are all exploited for their skins. Perhaps even more alarming is that in China, the world’s largest exporter of leather, producers skin an estimated 2 million dogs and cats every year. These skins are often not labeled or deliberately mislabeled in order to keep consumers in the dark. 
Furthermore, in India — one of the largest leather manufacturers in the world — cows are marched to slaughter for days without food or water. Those who collapse from exhaustion have chili peppers and tobacco rubbed into their eyes and their tails broken in order to keep them moving, said peta2. Animal skin is turned into finished leather using a variety of dangerous substances that harm the workers and the environment, such as mineral salts, formaldehyde, coal-tar derivatives, various oils and dyes, chromium and sulfuric acid.
As the world’s top wool exporter, Australia produces about 90 percent of all merino wool. In wool factories, the deplorable conditions create sheep and maggot infestation. To prevent flystrike, Australian ranchers often perform a barbaric procedure on sheep called “mulesing.” During this procedure, ranchers carve huge chunks of skin and flesh from the animals’ backsides or attach vise-like clamps to their flesh until they die. Usually done without any painkillers or anesthetics and deprived of food and water before being sheared, the sheep endure unnecessary pain until they are too weak to resist. 
Since shearers are usually paid by the volume and not by the hour, fast, rough work is encouraged. This leads to severe cuts on the sheep’s bodies. Workers don’t give sheep any painkillers before sewing up the gaping, bloody wounds caused by shearing. The sheep’s exploitation doesn’t end at the accumulation of their skin. Once the sheep are no longer wanted, the ranchers sell them for slaughter. 
These cruel practices are unfortunately not exclusive to fur, leather and wool. A variety of other animal-derived industries, such as exotic-skins, angora, down, suede, silk and cashmere exploit animals, the environment, and the workers for the sake of fashion. 
Fortunately, there are many cruelty-free fashion alternatives at many retailers in Los Angeles and online, where a cornucopia of vegan fashion awaits. MooShoes, for instance, is an all-vegan leather goods store located in Silver Lake. 
Dr. Martens, famous for their iconic heavy-duty boots, makes multiple vegan leather shoes. My faux-leather boots have already lasted me three years of everyday wear. Online stores such as Matt & Nat, Luca Chiara, Vegetaryn, bead & reel and jeane & jax exclusively offer vegan fashion. Additionally, retailers, such as Urban Outfitters and Free People, offer a multitude of vegan clothing options. If you’re into secondhand shopping, like me, make sure to read the label. As long as there are no animal products listed, you’re good to go.
Ethical consumerism has never been so fashionable. The alternatives, cheaper than their animal-product counterparts, more sustainable for the environment, and more compassionate towards animals and workers, make alternating faux leather for leather almost unquestionable. While fashion is an important part of our lives, being an advocate for faux products will allow you to be comfortable in your own skin, embrace self-love and respect and spread the message of compassion toward animals to those around you.

Great article, thanks for sharing. We are proud to carry 3000+ animal-free items.
Thanks for promoting animal-friendly fashions!
Great article! Rabbit fur is for rabbits, snakeskin is for snakes, cow hide is for cows, etc. Humans have plenty of stylish and humane vegan options to choose from.
I agree 100 percent.  With all the fabulous choices available, why would anyone drape their bodies in the skins of slaughtered animals?
“their carcasses are often dumped into landfills” – yes, to be turned into fertilizer which is then used on the vegetables we eat. “according to a 2013 CE Delft” – this report was commissioned by an animal rights group and is not a reliable source of information. “The alternatives, cheaper than their animal-product counterparts, more sustainable for the environment” – do you actually understand what the word sustainable means? The majority of faux products are not sustainable, they are made from petroleum by products and are neither biodegradable nor renewable. They are doing irreparable harm to our planet, and are way worse for the planet than real skins or furs. You live in California so you are right, you probably don’t need fur. But for those of us living in cities that get cold, fur and leather is way WAY better than that fake stuff made from petrol.
Love this article. I’m a proud faux fabric fashionista!
I completely agree – there’s no reason to support violence against animals when cozy, cool, and cruelty-free options are plentiful.

The USC women’s golf team is making an early-season splash, ranked No. 3 and coming off a season-opening victory at the ANNIKA intercollegiate. The Trojans prepare for the Stanford Intercollegiate, which begins on Friday. 
The team is coming off its 20th consecutive season reaching the NCAA championship and 11th straight year finishing in the top 5. The Trojans have won the ANNIKA two years in a row and it is their third season opening victory in the last four years. They erased a 13-stroke deficit in the final round to emerge victorious behind a career best event by redshirt senior Victoria Morgan, who finished a team best 8th place with a 7-under at 209.
“My game has come a long way over the last few years,” said Morgan, who originally joined the program as a walk-on. “More recently, we’ve put in a lot of work on my short game, so I’m excited to see that pay off under pressure just like the full-swing changes have.” 
In their second tournament at the Windy City Collegiate Classic in Chicago, the team placed third, only 5 strokes behind first place Georgia. Seniors Gabriella Then and Karen Chung finished in the top 10, tied for fourth and ninth, respectively, with freshman Allisen Corpuz and sophomore Robynn Ree finishing in the top 20, tied for 16th. 
Individually, the Trojans have put together quite a team. Senior Tiffany Chan competed in the Rio Olympics for Hong Kong as well as being named an All-American last season. Ree was also named an All-American last year. Freshman Allisen Corpuz is a three-time AJGA All-American. 
“Our team has an unreal amount of depth and talent,” Morgan said. “I’m excited to watch all of them tee it up. It could be a big year for us. We definitely have our eyes set on a national championship.”
Chan, Then and Chung will miss this week’s match at Stanford to compete in the second stage of the LPGA’s Q School.

This weekend, the women’s volleyball team will travel to Oregon to play both the Oregon Ducks and the Oregon State Beavers. On Friday, the team will face Oregon for their first match back since their tough loss to Arizona. 
The Trojans appeared to be missing focus and concentration against Arizona, who swept them 3-0 last week. While talented, USC is young and its inexperience has been a hindrance at times. Senior libero Taylor Whittingham is a superb defensive backbone — just three digs away from being fifth all time at USC in career digs — but if the communication between her and the other players on the court is missing, it is difficult for the team to have a solid chance on the offensive front. 
Head coach Mick Haley said the mistakes are fixable. 
“We didn’t play all that badly,” he said. “If we raise our game in a couple of areas and don’t make timely errors like we did — like a serving error at a real critical time — those kinds of things take the wind out of your sails.”
Oregon is ranked No. 16, with a 12-3 record and coming off a sweep of No. 10 Washington State, holding them to 10 and 14 points, respectively, in the last two sets.
“They’re playing at really the highest level you can play,” Haley said on Oregon’s success thus far. 
Though Oregon will be a tough opponent, the Trojans are 5-0 on the road this season. This is unusual, as typically teams prefer having the homecourt advantage, regardless of the sport — USC is 6-6 at home. 
“It might be that when you’re on the road, you have less distractions,” Haley said. “You have everyone together you can stay focused.” 
Freshman Khalia Lanier continues to stand out, with eight double-doubles for the season. She was instrumental in the win over Arizona State, with a career high of 22 kills during the match. So far, she is the only freshman to make top 10 in the Pac-12 conference in two categories: kills and points per set. With small tweaks in their game, the Trojans should see more success this weekend.
“We want to focus on the things that can help us a little bit better,” Haley said. “Serving, for sure, better passing, and our defense starts at the net, so our net blocking.” 
Oregon State is 8-9 on the season and 1-5 in conference play. Key players for the Beavers include junior outside hitter Mary-Kate Marshall, sophomore libero Kayla Ellis and redshirt sophomore setter and outside hitter McKenna Hollingsworth. 
“They continue to get better and better,” Haley said. “They’re only 1-5 in the conference, but we’ve been watching and they’re playing better each time. They’ll be at home on Sunday, and we can’t have a let down.” 
Both games will be televised on the Pac-12 Network. 
The recruiting has suffered the last few years since Bricio came on board. Some good players have left, academic problems,
and injuries. Two mediocre assistants does not help matters. Losing focus this far into the season is all on the coaches
especially getting swept at home. The team has been swept at least four times at home which is unacceptable . When UC
Irvine beats you 3 – 0 on your home floor it will be a very long season ahead which has proven out.

Deep into the weekly slug of college football, the routine has become monotonous. We have the weeklong predictions and analysis after nightly practices leading up to a full day dedicated to a game that lasts more than three hours. But luckily, we have a reprieve coming.
Football season is filled with lots and lots of great things — weekend road trips, the Fight Song being seared into your memory and the camaraderie that comes from 70,000 people joining forces in the Coliseum chanting “We are ’SC.” 
Basketball season is quickly approaching however, and with it a break from the tiresome routine of football season. Sure, USC doesn’t have the reputation for being a basketball school, but last year the team did well enough to garner large crowds at their conference home games.
With basketball comes as many exciting opportunities as football season does, including a more personal experience with DJ Malski, the ability to make signs that are throwing major shade and of course the slam dunks that make your head spin.
Basketball’s official season begins around the country this weekend as Midnight Madness takes the scene. Oh, what I would give to have Midnight Madness at USC. Ok, fine. We have our version of it, though Trojan Tip-Off just doesn’t compare to Kentucky’s Big Blue Madness — but I would hardly expect it to.
Midnight Madness is a long-standing tradition in the college basketball world originating from the time when teams would practice together for the first official time at the earliest possible date. Since then, it has become more of a celebratory kickoff to the season, but it still includes drills, practices and scrimmages for both the men’s and women’s teams for many schools, including at USC. 
At Kentucky, students and fans camp out to get tickets for the event, which begins at 7 p.m. on Oct. 14. USC’s event is scheduled for Oct. 22, a Saturday, beginning at noon. Of course, this is the football team’s bye week so maybe students will still be interested in meeting the teams? Who knows? Why not capitalize on last year’s hype and start this season off with a bang by doing a real Midnight Madness event?
Needless to say, with the “official” start of the basketball season less than two days away around the country, it should be a hopeful time for USC fans. After being a consistent cellar team in the Pac-12, USC had a breakout year, losing only two games at the Galen Center and being selected to the NCAA tournament (the best sports tournament in the world) for the first time since 2011.
A young team, the Trojans bring back three starters from the tournament, but also return their most dynamic bench players. Despite an early exit in the tournament and a lot still to prove to critics around the country, I believe in this team.
Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu was named a breakout player of the upcoming year by Fan Rag Sports. Metu averaged 6.4 points and 3.6 rebounds per game while consistently being good for at least one highlight reel play each game — either an eye-popping dunk on offense or a stalwart block on defense.
Metu is just one of several players who contributed to what was an exceptionally explosive USC team. Sophomore guard Bennie Boatwright, junior guard Elijah Stewart and redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron could regularly be seen competing in a dunk contest during warm-ups for fans who were lucky enough to come to the games early. Expect the same thing this year.
With another year of experience under their belt and with a taste of what success can bring after a disappointing end to the season, the men’s basketball team should be ready to take the next step and consistently compete at a high level.
Even though the football team has turned it around, no end-of-the-season result will ever appease the ravenous football fans of USC. For the basketball team though, things are different, and the genuine enthusiasm for the team that is shown by people who really care should be cherished.
The fact that the football team is suffering a dramatic and rough year only opens the door for the basketball team to make a greater impact, especially if they can capture the same energetic, and plain old-fun playing style that they had last year. I guess we’ll find out when the clock strikes midnight — or rather — noon.

Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanCatch me if you can · Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has frustrated opposing defenses with his scrambling ability. Head coach Clay Helton attributed some of his elusiveness to practicing against good players.
The sense of deflation that followed the Trojans during their slow season opening is nowhere to be found now, as players took to Howard Jones Field on Wednesday looking to keep moving up with a win over Arizona in Tucson this weekend.
Winging It
Head coach Clay Helton continued to discuss the playmaking ability of redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold, as the mobile signal caller has impressed with his ability to invent while scrambling since taking over the starting job.
“That’s something that comes when you have an athletic kid back there who can move around and create,” Helton said, speaking about Darnold’s improvised fumble-touchdown last weekend. “We’ve created some first downs because of it.”
If USC looks comfortable when things break down in-game, it’s because the Trojans get a great deal of practice on scramble drills during the week. Helton credited the defense’s ability to get pressure on Darnold as the reason the young quarterback has quickly learned to remain productive on the run.
“It comes about when you’re going good [players] on good [players],” Helton said. “We’re getting them naturally, and he’s doing a really nice job of maneuvering around in the pocket and knowing when to break contain.”
A Wrinkle in the Pass Rush
Another freshman making strides as the season progresses is defensive end Oluwole Betiku Jr., who head coach Clay Helton said would take on an increased role in the coming weeks.
“We’re playing these teams that … could play anywhere from 80-100 plays in a game. We need that third-down pass rush, and [Betiku] gives it to us,” he said. “We saw the light click on for him over the last two weeks, and we’ve decided to pull the trigger and allow him to help us on third down — and he’ll mix in hopefully on some special teams.”
And while the Trojan coaching staff hopes Betiku will terrorize whichever quarterback starts for Arizona on Saturday, Helton insisted the young lineman would be eased into the game plan.
“Even though he looks like a 30-year-old man, he’s a true freshman, and he’s learning a pro-style system with [defensive coordinator] Clancy [Pendergast],” Helton laughed. “We haven’t given him the entire package — he’s not entirely ready for first and second down — but to be able to cut him loose … we think is advantageous.”
No Surprises
Though the Trojans are unsure who will be at quarterback for the Wildcats, they have been dissecting Arizona’s offensive tendencies throughout the week to prepare defensively. But whether it’s Brandon Dawkins or Khalil Tate under center this weekend, USC knows it will be up against a speed demon.
“Electric,” Helton said of both players. “These two guys are elite runners in our mind.”
Not only are Wildcat quarterbacks fast, but they also aren’t afraid to show it, as Arizona is only behind Heisman candidate Lamar Jackson and Louisville in team quarterback rushing yards. This creates many big-play opportunities, which Pendergast was on-guard for during practice.
“They’re very unique in the way they use their run-pass options with the vertical passing game, which obviously gives people a lot of problems, and they execute very well,” he said. “They’re very high-level, they’ve been in that system for a few years now, and they know it well, and you can see by the way they execute.”

This election year marks the longest list of state propositions on a single ballot since March 2000. It is accompanied by a 224-page voter guide, pertaining to 17 different complex initiatives. Only 42 percent of registered California voters cast a ballot back in 2014 on the last ballot measures.  It’s no secret that this presidential election is casting a shadow over immediate issues that Californians face.  These ballot measures will constitute the most pressing questions that confront Californians on Nov. 8.  Simply voting in the  presidential election will not be enough. Politics often seems impersonal, overwhelming and distant for voters of all stripes and ages.  Yet for a number of reasons, these ballot measures represent an authentic and powerful means for citizens to change their lives and state.
Only Californians, not the entire nation, determine the result. Because they’re voting in a state projected to go to Hillary Clinton in a landslide victory, many Californians feel that their votes will not  make a difference this election;  but in terms of these ballots measures, nothing could be further from the truth. 
A simple majority of California voters hold the power to, for example, legalize marijuana and to change the prices of prescription drugs.  No primaries, no nation-wide election, no electoral college; just Californians voting for issues that matter to Californians.
 This is a direct referendum, not a vote to decide who will make these decisions.  In most elections, especially this presidential one, voters cast their ballots for men and women who they believe and hope will represent them and their needs.  But for a myriad of reasons, inaction often prevails, leading to a growing sense of frustration for many voters who see seats of government as homes of gridlock and partisanship.  Yet voters can find some solace on Nov. 8 because through marking 17 boxes they can register their opinions and send a message to Sacramento.
These measures are unique to California and thus will have a greater effect on residents than other elections — local, state or national — would have.  Covering topics from plastic bags to ammunition, these 17 proposals will impact the prison system, tax rates and almost everything in between.
Everyone has a stake in these measures.  For many students, marijuana legalization dominates the conversation.  Clocking in at a 35-year-high, roughly one in 17 college students in the U.S. smokes marijuana on a daily or near-daily basis.  The question becomes whether or not legalization will lead to a spike in usage, whether a tax on it could adequately fund awareness programs and if this law could reduce prison populations.  Some question whether this legalization would have much of an effect at all.
Another initiative seeks to essentially abolish the death penalty and replace it with life sentences while another seeks to expedite the execution process.  A particularly ambitious measure would borrow $9 billion in school bonds to invest in in K-12 schools and community colleges. A health-focused initiative calls for a price ceiling to cap the costs of prescription drugs while another seeks to prevent funds from being diverted from Medi-Cal, which provides free or low-cost health coverage for children and adults struggling to reach ends meet.  And interestingly, another polls voters on whether or not they want Californian lawmakers to repeal Citizens United, a national finance ruling that enables companies and unions to devote unlimited resources to fund federal campaigns.  Even though this initiative merely represents a glorified opinion poll, it could have national implications if Californians vote to repeal it and Californian lawmakers strive to achieve this at a federal level.
Students must cultivate awareness of the issues and motivation to register opinions.  Californians face 17 additional decisions on Nov. 8 and they owe it to themselves and to their state to research the initiatives and play an active role in shaping their communities through political participation.

While Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dismissed it as “locker room banter,” people across social media were quick to call out the dangerous nature of the now infamous Trump tapes, in which Trump, among other things, discusses kissing and grabbing women “by the p—y.” After the tape was released, one Twitter user, first introduced by The New York Times, Kelly Oxford, asked people to share their first experiences of sexual assault using the hashtag #notokay. The parallels between these stories and what Trump boasts about on the recording are undeniable. In fact, Oxford was able to use Trump’s exact language when describing her own first encounter with sexual assault — she was only 12 when a man grabbed her “by the p—y.”
 Actress and poet Amber Tamblyn was also inspired by Trump’s hateful rhetoric and took to Instagram before the debate on Sunday night. She captioned a photo of Trump with her own experience of being assaulted in public by an abusive ex. These stories show that Trump’s “locker room banter” is far from abstract. Rather, it is a horrifying and traumatic reality for too many. 
 After the leaked tapes, many members of the GOP began to distance themselves from Trump. In fact, many members of the party, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, have called for the presidential candidate to quit the race. Others, like Sen. John McCain, have disavowed Trump and said they refused to vote for him in the election. Even those who continue to support Trump for president have released statements distancing themselves from his lewd remarks. Trump’s own running mate, Mike Pence, said he was “offended by the words and actions” in the Trump video and said he “cannot defend them.”
 Despite the GOP’s outrage, I would encourage those Republicans who are condemning Trump’s comments to read the responses to Oxford’s #notokay hashtag and to actively interrogate their own complicity in rape culture. Rape culture, which is the cultural normalization of sexual violence, is much bigger than the Trump recording. In fact, some of the very same Republicans who condemn Trump promote rape culture in the legislation they propose.
 Pence may now try to take the moral high road and claim Trump’s comments are unacceptable, but don’t forget that he himself attempted to redefine rape in a 2012 Senate bill he co-sponsored. In the bill, federal funding for abortion would only be made available to women who suffered “forcible rape.” Pence’s track record for reproductive rights is abysmal to say the least.
 The outrage over Trump’s tape cannot be limited to outrage over the use of the word “p—y.” The tapes are abhorrent because they show Trump advocating for sexual assault. He demeans women and laughs about violating a woman’s autonomy. So if the GOP is going to disown Trump over these tapes — and not for the hundreds of other sexist, racist, Islamophobic and xenophobic comments he has made in the past — then the GOP must begin to take rape culture seriously.
 Trump’s comments have already mobilized thousands of women to share their story. At the peak of the #notokay hashtag, Kelly Oxford was receiving two stories of sexual assault every second. This conversation cannot stop at a hashtag. Trump’s dangerous comments should mobilize serious conversation in the home, in universities and in the halls of Congress.

Trump = horrible words.  Hillary = horrible actions.

This week’s series of poems are about finding forgiveness after betrayal. The first poem talks about the betrayal of being pulled in and pushed out of a relationship. As the poems progress, it discusses inner conflictions that have stemmed from the emotions of anger and sadness associated with the betrayal.
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
“IDENTITIES” is about the struggle of portraying my true identity. There are times when I constantly wonder if I am truly portraying who I actually am to others, or if the person they see when they look at me isn’t who I really am. I questioned how to be myself. While I struggled with these emotions of anger and sadness, some bad memories surfaced.
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
“Why I Don’t Play Patty Cake Anymore” is about one of these memories when people judged and bullied me for playing patty cake, a game traditionally geared toward girls, when I was five years old. It was difficult for me to understand who I was because I was being told by others who they thought I was.
Steven Vargas | Daily Trojan
The last few poems are about finally getting over the feelings and searching for forgiveness. I stepped back and realized I couldn’t forget about the people I care about in my life. I forgave and continued.
