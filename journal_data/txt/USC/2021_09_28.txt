Men’s tennis wrapped up a competitive weekend at the Southern Intercollegiate Championship in Athens, Ga. The Trojans started the tournament Friday against Ohio State University, then played against University of Texas Saturday and University of Georgia Sunday. 
“Our guys did a good job,” said head coach Brett Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Overall, we competed really hard and every day was different in regards to us growing, and that was one of our goals.” 
The Trojans earned three singles wins Friday against Ohio State as No. 68 junior Stefan Dostanic upset No. 20 graduate student Matej Vocel 7-6 (5), 6-4, freshman Peter Makk defeated sophomore JJ Tracy 6-1, 7-6 (4) and junior Ryder Jackson beat sophomore Lancelot Carnello 6-4, 1-6, 6-1. This is Dostanic’s second week in a row coming away with tournament victories. 
“Stefan is just really trying to come into his own in trying to solidify himself as a top player in the country,” Masi said. “I think he’s trying to take over for some players before him, like Brandon [Holt] and Daniel [Cukierman], … and try to make his mark and show he can compete at that level.”  
USC, however, did not manage any doubles wins on Friday as Ohio State junior Robert Cash and Vocel beat Dostanic and Makk 8-4. Junior Cannon Kingsley and JJ Tracy got the victory over the USC duo of senior Bradley Frye and sophomore Lodewijk Weststrate 8-7 (5), and junior Justin Boulais and Lancelot Carnello beat USC graduate students Paul Barretto and Jackson 8-4. USC finished with a 3-3 record in singles and an 0-3 record in doubles. 
The Trojans earned two singles wins against Texas on Saturday as Dostanic upset No. 58 junior Siem Woldeab 7-5, 7-5 and Barretto defeated junior Eshan Talluri 6-2, 6-2. The Trojans bounced back from their struggles in Friday’s doubles on Saturday, earning wins in all three of their doubles matches against Texas. Frye and Makk beat Woldeab and senior Cleeve Harper 8-6. Barretto and Dostanic beat sophomore Micah Braswell and junior Evin McDonald 8-4, and Jackson and junior Samuel Rubell defeated Talluri and senior Nevin Arimilli 8-5. USC finished its play against Texas with a 2-4 record in singles and a perfect 3-0 in doubles. 
“We said we [needed] to come out with a little bit more energy and fire [the next day],” Masi said. “We lost to Texas last year in two matches 4-3, they ended our season so there’s also a little more incentive when we go out there and play those guys.” 
On Sunday, the Trojans closed out the tournament with two wins in singles and one win in doubles against Georgia. Makk got an upset win for the Trojans defeating No. 23 graduate student Hamish Stewart 3-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 in three sets. 
“I think he just stayed level headed, stayed in the moment, and competed throughout the entire match,” Masi said. “He was changing his game plan when he needed to and made the necessary adjustments at the right time to get himself over the hump.”
Jackson beat junior Erik Grevelius 6-4, 6-2 getting USC its second singles win. In doubles, Barretto and Jackson beat Grevelius and senior Blake Croyder 8-6 to close out the tournament. USC finished its play Sunday against Georgia, going 2-3 in singles and 1-2 in doubles. 
The Trojans wrapped up the tournament with a 7-10 record in singles and a 4-5 record in doubles. 
“I think all the guys saw certain things they needed to improve on whether it’s mentally, physically or tactically … and we can get to work on some of those things,” Masi said. 
USC will travel to Tulsa, Okla. for the St. Francis Health System ITA Men’s All-American Championships beginning Friday.

It’s no surprise that there’s a huge learning curve in the National Football League, particularly at the quarterback position. Learning completely different offensive systems, struggling to find chemistry with an entirely new group of receivers and running backs and competing against the best defensive players in the world takes more than a few weeks of adjustment. 
Rookie starting quarterbacks struggling out of the gate isn’t a new phenomenon and certainly isn’t indicative of the rest of their careers. Peyton Manning, who is one of the best quarterbacks of all time, threw more interceptions, 28, than touchdowns, 26, his rookie year. But for teams whose fans are growing more and more impatient, it’s about time we start asking some tough questions. 
What’s going on with Trevor Lawrence? 
Trevor Lawrence has had a disappointing start to his NFL career, but the Jacksonville Jaguars have historically not been the best place for a young quarterback to learn the position. In fact, Blake Bortles is probably the best quarterback to come out of Jacksonville, and he is currently a free agent. Since his departure, Jacksonville hasn’t been able to figure out its quarterback situation.
Lawrence had a great college career, dominating his freshman season and bringing a national championship to Clemson University. With only four interceptions and 30 touchdowns, Lawrence’s decision-making abilities and arm strength quickly shot his name to the top of the draft board. 
But so far, he has struggled to find his footing in the league. Through three games, Lawrence has a completion rate of only 54% and has thrown a whopping seven interceptions with only five touchdowns. The Jaguars are 0-3 and will be lucky to throw together a few wins this season. 
Calling Lawrence a “bust” at this point would be foolish. The Jaguars’ offense desperately needs improvement in the tackle and tight end positions. Combined with a subpar defense, Lawrence doesn’t have the elite weapons he was used to at Clemson. However, Lawrence’s decision-making has been a red flag at times. 
Most of Lawrence’s interceptions have come within the pocket and without overwhelming pressure from the opposition’s defensive line. He has simply missed his targets time and time again, delivering some highly questionable passes. Lawrence will have to deliver his throws more quickly in order to catch defenses off guard. 
Jacksonville’s new head coach and Ohio State University legend, Urban Meyer, might not be the best fit for Lawrence or even the NFL. Going from the college game to the pros is a tall order. Despite being a master recruiter, Meyer has produced very few NFL-caliber quarterbacks. Cardale Jones, J.T. Barrett and Dwayne Haskins are just a few of the Ohio State flops in the NFL. While Meyer and Lawrence will have a grace period of a few years, Jaguars’ fans have been waiting too long to be disappointed yet again. 
When will the Bears invest in protecting Justin Fields? 
The Bears have frankly been a mess under head coach Matt Nagy’s control. After going 12-4 in Nagy’s first season, which was more of a byproduct of Chicago’s dominant defense than the mediocre Mitchell Trubisky-led offense, the Bears have only disappointed. Trubisky fell off, Chicago’s defense clearly peaked in 2018, and the play calling has been questionable. 
Enter Justin Fields. Wait, I mean Andy Dalton. 
The decision to start Andy Dalton over the Bears’ first round quarterback was controversial and boring — fans wanted to see their new quarterback, who showed his toughness on a national stage last year after fighting through a rib injury to win the Sugar Bowl with Ohio State. 
After seeing Fields play so far this year, Nagy might have been on to something by starting the 11-year veteran Dalton, who is now recovering from a knee injury after going down in Week 2. 
In his first NFL start Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, Fields went 6 of 20 for 68 yards with one interception. He was also sacked nine times for an overall loss of 67 yards. Thus, as a team, the Chicago Bears gained a single yard in their passing game. Oof. 
To be fair, the Browns have one of the better defensive units in the league, led by one of the premier defensive ends in Myles Garrett. Additionally, the Bears have a subpar offensive line which perhaps contributed to the fact that Fields was sacked nine times this Sunday. 
The Bears simply must upgrade their entire offense in order to complement Fields’ play style. A better offensive line, particularly against the pass rush, is a must for the Bears. Chicago gave up so much for linebacker Khalil Mack, who solidified the teams’ defense as one of the best in the league a couple years ago. Now, the Bears are running out of time to take advantage of the remainder of their defense’s prime.

No. 1 USC put its unbeaten record to the test this weekend in the MPSF Invitational Tournament as the team faced off against some of the best ranked teams in the country. The Trojans improved their record to 10-0 on the season and were a force to be reckoned with throughout the tournament. USC beat No. 7 UC Davis, No. 3 Stanford and hosts No. 3 Cal to capture the title.
USC went into the invitational as one of the favorites to win, as it received a first-round bye along with No. 1 UCLA. USC took on UC Davis for a second straight week and won 13-8. Seven different Trojans scored in the match. USC finished on Saturday with a much closer game against Stanford, winning 15-8. The Trojans took control with four stretches of scoring two or more goals in short succession. The Trojans picked up their first win against Stanford since 2019, snapping a three-game losing streak against the Cardinal. USC finished having never trailed, heading into the title match against California.
The Trojans stormed out of the gates quickly in the title match as redshirt junior driver Ashworth Molthen scored within 18 seconds, and fellow redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube scored three minutes later to grow the lead to 2-0. The Golden Bears scored twice before the Trojans would find the back of the net again. Molthen helped answer back to grab USC one more goal before halftime, but Cal followed suit as the game deadlocked at 3-3 at the half. 
Head coach Marko Pintaric was pleased with the team’s overall performance in the first half.
“Our defense really stood up in preventing Cal from scoring,” Pintaric said. “We just [needed] to keep up the intensity and the offense will come, and pretty much just stick to the game plan.”
USC was able to hang on to a one-goal lead entering the final quarter of play as Molthen got his hat-trick scoring with just four seconds remaining in the third quarter to make it 8-7. A mere 41 seconds after seeing Cal tie it up again, the Trojans went on a 4-1 run for the next three and a half minutes to take a 12-9 lead. USC would then surrender two quick goals, but, after that, the Trojans’ defense held strong thanks in part to senior goalkeeper Nic Porter. Porter had 14 total saves, including huge power play saves down the stretch and two clutch saves in the final minute to stop the Golden Bears from forcing overtime.
The Trojans came away victorious, defeating California by a score of 12-11. 
Despite the win, Pintaric said he feels the team has to improve on putting the easy opportunities away.
“That kind of allows the opponent to stay close to us,” Pintaric said. “This is something that we are constantly addressing, and constantly working on … To win high importance water polo games, you have to put those opportunities away.”
Having made it through half of the season, the Trojans are looking to ride their hot streak into the NCAA tournament where they hope to reclaim their crown as champions.
The Trojans have only one game next week as they host No. 8 Pacific at 1 p.m. Saturday at Uytengsu.

When Marshall Amaya and Jonathan Laifman took the course “Fundamentals of the U.S. Legal System” together last year, the classmates’ interest in the law field amid a lack of available resources inspired them to create their own undergraduate law review journal. Designed to allow for critical analysis of legal topics, Trojan Review will launch within the next two semesters and provide opportunities for students interested in the legal field. 
Amaya, a junior majoring in economics, said that he and Laifman found their class with professor Donald Scotten to be “engaging and very inspiring.” Both he and Laifman, a senior majoring in physics, also noticed how other students in their class had an interest in law and discovered that further guidance or resources could lead them to develop great argumentation and research in the field.
“Jonathan and I both realized that there wasn’t exactly a publication on campus that really helps guide undergraduates to start developing legal research to understand the nuances of legal writing,” Amaya said. “We wanted to provide a pre-law organization that helped make law school accessible.” 
Amaya first approached Scotten with the idea to start an undergraduate law journal in Fall 2020, and later teamed up with Laifman to begin planning in Spring 2021. Scotten, the vice dean for administration of the Gould School of Law and faculty advisor for the Trojan Review, served as a “helpful guide and established the direction of the law review,” Amaya said. 
“[Amaya and Laifman] came to me with the idea,” Scotten said. “I told them that my job is to assist them and support them, and provide help where they need it … I really wanted it to be their organization in terms of how it was created and restructured and run, because it was their brainchild.”
Along with Scotten, Amaya and Laifman created a one-unit course offered through the Gould School of Law this semester temporarily named “LAW 490: Directed Research,” in which students will contribute to the Trojan Review and be encouraged to be well-versed in legal writing. In the future, Amaya said the course will likely change its name to “LAW 490: Trojan Review.”
“By the end of the course, they’ll be asked to start brainstorming their own ideas of perhaps a topic that they’d like to explore, that they’re intellectually curious about,” Amaya said. “Further down the line, they can start doing the research and writing and drafting and hopefully be published down the line in the Trojan Review.” 
At the moment, Trojan Review does not have an official executive board, and intends to adapt its structure once there is a growth in membership. Excluding Amaya and Laifman, the review has at least 21 members. 
Amaya said that the journal will allow students to analyze certain cases or a specific legal issue in the essays they publish. However, the journal currently has no definite limits on the subject matter it will publish.
“I’m not sure if it’s possible to say what will be included and what won’t be just because we don’t know if each issue will have a theme to it or a topic to it,” Amaya said. “They will consist of articles that pertain to the law in one way or another.”
While in the future they intend to narrow down the ideas and topics covered in the Trojan Review, Laifman said that the journal intends to feature publications from students, professors and law professionals. Besides publishing online, Trojan Review may also begin a podcast where law students, law firm officials, clerks, and judges would have the opportunity to discuss different legal issues or their professions. 
Scotten said that the presence of Trojan Review fills a gap at the University and expands into students’ other fields of study. 
“[The Trojan Review] fills a space where it allows undergraduate students to write in the field of law, but not really law as an independent discipline, but law as an interdisciplinary study where they bring in their knowledge from other areas,” Scotten said. “Long story short, it gives undergraduate students an opportunity to really do research, not only in their field, but to expand in their field to really see what interfaces intersect with their studies.”
One of the primary demographics of the law review is undergraduate students looking for an outlet to demonstrate their research and explore their interest in the law field. Laifman considers the law review as a staple of any law school throughout the nation.
“The real mission, though, comes down to [recognizing that] there is a gap in the USC community, and that people who are interested in law had very few avenues to go down,” Laifman said. “There was a pre-law fraternity, there was a mock trial and now the [moot] court, but in terms of academic work, there wasn’t any real guidance.”
The status of the Trojan Review remains in its early stages with no official staff being designated as of yet. As with other organizations, Trojan Review must be approved and recognized by the Undergraduate Student Government before its official launch. 
Students interested in joining Trojan Review can contact Amaya or Laifman directly, or fill out the interest form located on the journal’s official website. 
“I think the one thing is to underline how unique it is to have an undergraduate law review,” Laifman said. “There are colleges around that have it, but for how central it is to the law school experience and how ubiquitous it is throughout all law schools … this is really something that would be great for USC students, because it’s going to be an amazing opportunity to prepare them for law school.”

The BTS Meal — a novel collaboration between K-pop’s poster child, BTS, and American fast food’s timeless older brother, McDonald’s — launched in the United States May 26 and consisted of 10 chicken nuggets, two sauces, medium fries and a medium coke. 
One might dismiss the BTS Meal as a cheesy marketing tactic to sell pre-existing menu items at a higher markup. Upon closer inspection, however, this glorified Korean 10-piece meal combo signals much more than just flavors of chili and cajun. McDonald’s BTS Meal is a unique tale of fans, the music industry and globalization.
Within the last year, BTS took the Western market by storm. Their English hit single, “Butter,” set five new Guinness World Records, surpassing “Dynamite” for the most views on a music video premiere on YouTube — 3.9 million concurrent viewers. Several months ago, BTS made Grammy history by being the first K-pop group nominated for best pop duo/performance group. They were also the first K-pop group to debut at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100. 
Of course, the fans — called ARMY — are the drivers of BTS’s worldwide success. But how did an authentically K-pop act manage to grab the spotlight in a particular sounding American hip-hop market? I’m not a K-pop expert, so I decided to turn to Victoria Chan, music lover and fellow writer at Daily Trojan, who has followed BTS since its early eras. 
According to Chan, BTS’s music is catchy, but it isn’t the main ingredient behind the group’s success.
“What makes BTS different from American artists is the personal connection they create with the fans,” Chan said. “If you’ve seen them on Korean variety shows and interviews, they’re super authentic, humble and extremely funny. You can just watch a clip of them on YouTube or on TV and immediately feel happier.” 
Other BTS listeners’ experiences support Victoria’s perspective. In an SF GATE interview, psychiatric nurse practitioner Carolain Peregrino noted BTS’ impact on helping her clients  cope with depression and balance negative emotions.
“[In ARMY], you start to meet other people online who actually were saved by BTS, and they talk about it. ‘They saved me from depression.’ ‘My daughter had cancer and they saved me,’” Peregrino said.
This message of positivity and vulnerability is clearly visible in the album names and their songs’ lyrics. The BTS Meal practically solidified their brand as a household name among Western audiences.
The BTS Meal was actually so successful that a secondary “drop” market was created for it. The demand for the meal was so high that several McDonald’s in Indonesia had to temporarily close down. On eBay, people sold BTS Meal bags and sauces for more than double the original price. According to Business Insider, customers purchased listings for these bags and sauces at more than $44. 
Worldwide, hardcore fans preserved their meal bags by framing them, turning them into phone cases and housing decor and even creating clothes with them. Economically, the BTS Meal is a unique example of a cheap, disposable product becoming a luxury item over a short period of time. 
From a marketing perspective, some argue that the BTS meal even redefined fast food marketing, by showing audiences that even global pop stars can enjoy nuggets and sweet chili sauce once in a while. The collaboration itself was McDonald’s first international marketing campaign and a symbol for globalization and the interconnectedness of both food and music. 
Furthermore, McDonald’s became the essential face of celebrity partnerships: They used celebritism to increase the perceived value of food, and they used food to create a more personal connection to the artist: “If this is Saweetie’s go-to order, you can BET that I am ordering this too!”
Considering the global dominance of BTS, some argue that BTS — and K-pop as a whole — could be losing its roots. Some die-hard fans claim that, in their quest to break into the Western market, BTS abandoned the “K” in K-pop. Indeed, they sung their two latest most popular hits, “Butter” and “Dynamite,” completely in English, which challenges the boundaries of whether they qualify as “Korean pop” or just “pop.” 
“While BTS has remained authentic and humble throughout the years, their sound has noticeably changed,” Chan said. “The beat and production of many [of their] songs are more similar to Western pop music.” There is much debate regarding whether or not BTS is vying too heavily for white validation.
While the K-pop genre isn’t purely Korean, I believe the Westernization of BTS’s music isn’t necessarily a negative thing. For one, it is undeniable that K-pop’s reach drastically expanded before “Dynamite” and “Butter.” I wouldn’t have enjoyed annoying my friends by terribly singing some of their iconic songs if it were not for my introduction to BTS through “Dynamite.” 
Secondly, music in every country borrows from each other. No genre is completely pure. Rock music borrows from African American gospel music, modern hip-hop borrows from Latin rhythms and even English baroque music borrows from Roman compositions. Music is a medium that evolves while maintaining its roots.
Although the BTS Meal situated BTS as the undisputed global leader in the Korean music industry, their spot at the top is constantly challenged by other, newer groups in the industry. Victoria believes that in 10 years, its members may go on to pursue solo careers. 
While their popularity will not last forever, BTS impacted the global music industry by making strides for Asian representation in Western markets. They’ve broken records, established a global legacy and will continue to be appreciated — or criticized — by listeners. Thirty years later, the BTS Meal might even be a luxury K-pop artifact.

German-Iraqi electronic music producer Alexander Ridha’s, also known as Boys Noize’s, signature brand of twisted techno and acidic dance music has always been a force to be reckoned with in the sphere of popular music. His newest album, “+/-” (pronounced “Polarity”), is perhaps the most impressive addition to his resume. Released on his own label, Boysnoize Records, the album explores Ridha’s understanding of duality across 15 tracks by employing sonically polarized sounds, ranging from gritty house to atmospheric and soulful electronic. In doing so, Ridha cements his place as a peerless frontrunner in EDM, pushing the genre’s boundaries to incredibly innovative extremes.
Describing his life as an up-and-coming DJ in Berlin, Ridha in an interview with Billboard said, “Every Sunday night, I would play from 2:00 ‘til 5:00 in the morning, go home, take a shower, go to school on Monday morning.” This dichotomy clearly informs the sound of “+/-,” which can be seen as primarily divided between club-ready, warehouse-style, industrial EDM and more abstract techno and electronic.
The mainstream and oddball sounds permeating the record are also complemented by a variety of guests, all of whom provide essential contributions to the record’s polarized full picture. Take the record’s lead single, “Girl Crush,” which would be obsolete without the contributions of Maryland’s hyper-aggressive sugary-rap mainstay Rico Nasty. Over thumping industrial bass and heavy electronics, Nasty nightmarishly raps “I think I got a girl crush / I think I got a girl crush.” 
PC Music’s raunchy and humorous Estonian rapper Tommy Cash provides surprisingly sensual verses on the multi-faceted single “Nude,” which oscillates between giving listeners air to breathe and pounding their ears with abrasive, acidic sonics and bass. Alternative R&B songstress ABRA upholds the record’s club-friendly sensuousness on highlight “Affection,” where she hypnotically commands her partner not to “feed [her] affection.”
The instant gratification these tracks provide is clearly owed to Boys Noize’s brilliantly engineered collaborations and the fireworks that explode when his guests complement his intoxicatingly sour and pulsating soundscapes.
Although a majority of “+/-” is optimally designed for inducing post-pandemic euphoria at the club, Ridha is unafraid to experiment with styles not inherently conducive to his signature hellish EDM sound. As Ridha mentioned to Pitchfork while promoting the album, ​​“When you combine opposites, something transcendent can take place, something greater than the two parts. And with music, it becomes a magic that can create new worlds.” This becomes especially apparent on the album’s stunning centerpiece “Ride or Die,” a collaboration with classically-trained musician and MC Chilly Gonzalez and vocalist and cellist Kelsey Lu.
Gonzalez’s classical influences result in the single featuring some of the only piano sounds heard across the entire record, new musical territory as compared to Ridha’s usually electronics-exclusive mode of production. Lu’s haunting vocal refrain “Like a kiss on the run / Like a kiss on the run / Be my ride or die / Be my ride or die” soars over crescendoing instrumentation that comes to a rapturous climax in the song’s latter half, continuing the record’s thematic threads of duality and contrast.
A key collaborator for artists such as Lady Gaga, Frank Ocean, A$AP Rocky, Snoop Dogg and Skrillex, Ridha has long operated at the decks and been known for his work as a remixer and DJ rather than a soloist, though that changes now. Although the roster of guests is certainly one of the album’s most pivotal components, Ridha sets out to prove that the album’s solo tracks can pull their weight just as much.
The album’s opener “Close,” as well as deep cut “XYXY,” get raucous with their futuristic percussion and slimy grooves. The real solo standout arrives with “Xpress Yourself,” which loops a whispered refrain of “Express yourself” over breakneck bubblegum bass. Ridha’s employment of campy vocal samples on these tracks among others adds a playful flair to his music that has been previously absent.
“+/-” is not without its faults. The tracklist, no matter how polarized at times, does tend to homogenize and blend together at a certain point. The second half of the record loses a bit of momentum as it moves into the more musically abstract. However, as a whole, the album sees Ridha in peak form as he displays complete mastery over his trademark sound of abrasive, demonic techno and house and sonically explores duality like never done before.

BADBADNOTGOOD — “Beside April”
Critics used terms such as “unique” and “imaginative” to describe BADBADNOTGOOD’s music, but the Canadian collective was just another example of a common phenomenon: white men in proximity to hip-hop. The trio came together at Humber College’s music school where they bonded over a shared love of alternative hip-hop and performed jazzy renditions of Odd Future songs. Supposedly, their instructors hated it. But the group persisted, got noticed by Tyler, The Creator and went viral soon after. Suddenly, they were popular enough to drop out of college and thumb their noses at the professors who probably just wanted them to make a 12-bar blues, or something.
Unfair or not, it was easy to be skeptical of BADBADNOTGOOD. They were the kind of music nerds that would use terms like syncopation to fawn over a J Dilla beat but were flippant about their music-making craft. Much of the group’s early songs were pointless jam sessions. But they were also studious musicians and had a genuine appreciation for hip-hop history. Producing for artists, such as their 2015 collaboration with Ghostface Killah, helped them focus their talents.
Now five years after their last album, BADBADNOTGOOD did what people do when they want to grow up: learn from their elders. In their case, they consulted with Arthur Verocai, the 76-year-old Brazilian composer who has become sort of a cult figure within the hip-hop/alternative community. Verocai’s influence is palpable throughout “Beside April,” from the orchestral strings to the experimental but controlled composition. A soothing bossa nova beat at the beginning of the song gives way to a thunderous guitar solo, and these sonic contrasts create a beautiful tension that pushes and pulls throughout. 
Unlike some of their earlier work, “Beside April” sees BADBADNOTGOOD at their most intentional, with each note and instrument carefully thought out. The collective already has an impressive sheet of accomplishments and list of collaborators, but its best music may still be ahead.
KeiyaA — “Rectifiya”
“Forever, Ya Girl,” KeiyaA’s self-released, self-produced 2020 album, is one of the best projects in recent memory. The artist, born Chakeiya Richmond, crafts intimate music through her sparse thoughts and frustrations. Like Solange in “When I Get Home,” KeiyaA prefers to use mood as the messenger; her songwriting isn’t complex, but it is profound.
Outside of Solange, “Forever, Ya Girl” also seems inspired by some of KeiyaA’s Chicago counterparts — specifically Noname and Jamila Woods, Black female artists engaged radically with their work. On “I! Gits! Weary!” KeiyaA sings, “If to build and destroy is to be divine/Then all I really want is peace of mind.” When the burden of fixing the ills of this world are so often placed on the shoulders of those harmed the most by it, isn’t asking for rest a liberatory act?
On “Rectifiya,” KeiyaA builds a chorus and song of the backbone of a question: “Who rectifying me?” The question is specific and rests on the word “rectify,” but it’s addressed ambiguously — she could be addressing a specific person or something more abstract. Her precise language and framing in the songwriting carries a literary quality. Her songs give listeners something to contemplate.
Giveon — “For Tonight”
The problem with having a one-of-a-kind singing voice is that it spurs an A&Rs mind to go wild with ideas, and not many of them are good. Enter Giveon, who was “discovered” after Drake featured him on “Chicago Freestyle” and had fans wondering who was behind the baritone voice. He followed with his debut EP, “Take Time,” in 2020 that had some gems and positioned him as an artist to watch in the R&B scene. He then dropped a nondescript song with fellow R&B artist Snoh Aalegra, re-released his album with some more songs and found his way to the charts after appearing on Justin Bieber’s “Peaches.” 
If 2021 has been about getting Giveon to the mainstream, consider him there after “For Tonight.” His voice was simply too good to be ignored by record labels, too valuable to be hidden from Spotify-curated playlists and radioplay. “For Tonight” has Giveon doing his best Sam Smith impression, crooning cheesy lines such as, “Honest, honest, that’s just a game we know/we both can’t play” over the most routine piano line and boom-boom-clap drum pattern.
It’s unfortunate that, in making Giveon more palatable to audiences, much of the depth of his artistry has been left behind. But this has been a common occurrence in the R&B genre, which seems to have the largest ideological chasm between the vision of its talent and the music industry’s demands. There’s no better example than Frank Ocean and the label drama that surrounded “blonde.” Like Ocean, Giveon can write beautiful songs and bring them to life with his voice, but it will require him to wrestle creative control from the label overlords cheapening his music.
“Eddie on Aux” is a biweekly series on a few songs that intrigue me. They don’t have to be earth-shattering or terrible, just something interesting enough to warrant an article. It is not a recommendation of what to play in the car to impress your friends, despite what the title suggests.

Ray DeMonia was a 73-year-old man born and raised in Cullman, Alabama. He spent 40 years running his own antiquing business and was enjoying retirement until he suffered a cardiac event last month.
In a pre-coronavirus world, Ray would have been admitted to his local intensive care unit, treated and likely released days later. Instead, his family watched in horror as medical staff contacted 43 other hospitals in search of an available bed. They finally found one 200 miles away across the Mississippi state border. Unfortunately, the transfer came too late. Ray DeMonia died on Sept. 1, succumbing to his symptoms.
As the delta variant spreads across the United States, it is finding every last unvaccinated space to stake its claim. There’s no shortage of space for the disease to hole up either: An estimated 146 million people remain unvaccinated in the U.S. Of those 146 million, 14% firmly oppose the vaccine.
The reasoning behind the skepticism of the 14% is largely political: The vaccination gap between counties that voted for Trump and those that voted for Biden has increased from 6.5% to 11.7% in just two months.
So what happens when 20.4 million people baselessly refuse the vaccine? Hospitals get overrun.
“When the delta variant was the predominant variant, those who were unvaccinated were about four and a half times more likely to get COVID-19, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die from the disease,” said director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, last week at a White House briefing.
In DeMonia’s home state of Alabama, ICU capacity has maxed out for weeks, with coronavirus patients occupying about half of all beds.
It’s not like car accidents and cardiac events took the last year and a half off when coronavirus showed up. In a regular year, emergency rooms receive 136 million patients. Boosting that number by several million has pushed our medical facilities to the brink. Treatable conditions and injuries are pushed to the back of the line due to the sheer lack of space and staffing.
It begs the question: Should we help anti-vaxxers at all?
Before continuing with this difficult question, it’s imperative to recognize that we are discussing the 14% of unvaccinated people refusing the vaccine for political or otherwise blatantly ignorant personal reasons. Millions of Americans are unable to receive the vaccine due to disability or chronic illness. These people, more than any other group, rely on the general public to get vaccinated and eventually achieve herd immunity. Should they fall ill with coronavirus, or any other ailment, healthcare providers should treat them to the fullest extent.
People who are chronically ill and disabled are innocent bystanders of this ongoing national tragedy, and often bear the brunt of the virus’ — as well as the country’s — ugliest side effects.
One way to clear ICU space is to stop prioritizing the medical assistance of anti-vaxxers.
Much of the anti-vaccination rhetoric is borne out of rugged individualism — the belief that with enough hard work, one person can achieve anything. It’s this ideology that has dominated the U.S. ethos for centuries. While that might apply to starting a business, it certainly doesn’t apply to medical science.
This has been explained, re-explained, broadcasted, reworded, repackaged and reiterated since the first vaccine doses rolled out in January, nearly eight months ago. For millions of Americans, it’s clear that the concept of neighborly conscientiousness is overruled by personal pride.
DeMonia’s obituary lists his cause of death as a cardiac event, but it might as well read “death by third-party protest.” Hundreds — potentially thousands — more have suffered the same fate. This reeks of injustice on behalf of those lost as well as their loved ones. It often feels as though we are locking up the public for the criminals’ offenses.
Perhaps the most respectful response, then, is to let the Anti-Vaccination Party practice its faith without interruption. If anti-vaxxers believe that any one person on their own can achieve anything, without the assistance of the federal government, paramedics or immunological specialists, then in accordance with that religiosity, they should not be admitted to a hospital and they should not be assigned a bed in the ICU. Those spaces should be reserved for veterans with gallstones and grandmothers suffering from heart attacks — people who are participating in a different belief system.
Anti-vaxxers have made their bed. Now they can be sick in it.
Writer’s Note: Aside from his antique business, Ray DeMonia served as auctioneer for the Cullman Rotary Club fundraiser and the Annual Draw Down Auction for the Hospice of Cullman County, Inc. Donations in his honor are more than appreciated.
