Former Texas defensive coordinator Todd Orlando has been named the defensive coordinator at USC, head coach Clay Helton announced Friday.
The news comes after USC’s Holiday Bowl loss to Iowa and an inconsistent USC defense led defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast to be relieved of his duties. Pendergast coached at USC for four seasons.
“When you’re looking at a job, the No. 1 thing is who you’re working for,” Orlando said in a video on USC Athletics’ Twitter. “The second part is, can you win a championship? And there’s no doubt in my mind that we will get that done. And then the third thing is whether or not you can sustain it through recruiting. And when you look at the great state of California and just look at Los Angeles itself, just the talent that’s in this area — we’ll be able to sustain championships.”
Orlando was fired by Texas on Dec. 1 along with many other members of the Longhorns’ coaching staff. He accepted a job as Texas Tech’s assistant head coach and linebackers coach earlier this month before backing out to coach at USC.
Before his three-year stint at Texas, Orlando was a defensive coordinator for Houston, Florida International, Utah State and Connecticut. At Texas, Orlando was able to help the Longhorns win three straight bowl games, including this year’s Alamo Bowl victory against Utah. Texas also competed in the Big 12 Championship game in 2018 but fell to Oklahoma and current Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray.
“We are excited to have Todd join our Trojan football program,” Helton said in a press release. “He is an experienced and successful defensive coordinator who has made an impact everywhere he has coached. He brings a passion, energy, toughness and discipline to his coaching and those characteristics were evident in our discussions. His defensive system poses an extreme challenge to offenses.”
Orlando will inherit a USC defense that ranked 78th in the FBS in yards allowed per game this season with 408.7, just ahead of South Alabama and Liberty. Texas’ defense, however, ranked 97th in the same statistic with 431.5 yards allowed per game.
“I really believe that in today’s game, creating negative yardage plays, attacking the quarterback, turnovers, all those things go into creating explosive plays on defense,” Orlando said. “We’ll see how much we can handle going into spring football, but expect us to really do two things: run and hit.”
The move comes after Helton reportedly failed to lure Los Angeles Rams assistant head coach and linebackers coach Joe Barry to the position, according to ESPN. Barry, a former linebacker at USC in the early 1990s, was a graduate assistant for the Trojans from 1994-95 and returned to campus in 2010 as a linebackers coach under Lane Kiffin, the same year Helton was hired as a quarterbacks coach for the Trojans. Barry was presumed the favorite for the USC defensive coordinator job throughout the search until deciding to stay with the Rams.
Recently extended offensive coordinator Graham Harrell interviewed with the Philadelphia Eagles for their offensive coordinator opening, but The Athletic reported Monday Harrell would stay in Los Angeles, so USC’s main coaching staff seems to be set for the 2020 season opener against Alabama in Arlington, Texas on Sep. 5.
“I had a chance to see the guys work out,” Orlando said. “Excited to get a chance to work with them, excited for them to get through my office so we can sit down, talk about things that are outside of football, embrace each other and get to work.”

Despite appearing in 13 of the past 19 AFC Championship games, the New England Patriots will not make an appearance in this year’s Super Bowl. Their quarterback, 42-year-old Tom Brady, is one of the most accomplished NFL players of all time, and his resume speaks for itself: six Super Bowl rings, four MVPs, 14 Pro Bowl selections … the list goes on and on.
It’s easy to give Brady the title of “Greatest of All Time” (the GOAT) when you look at his accolades and the Patriots’ dominance over the years. However, I believe that Tom Brady is overrated and nothing more than an average system quarterback playing under the greatest coach of all time.
The best thing to ever happen to Brady is Bill Belichick: The Patriots’ systems, schemes and coaching talents have nearly been flawless throughout their dynastic run. If you take Brady out of New England, they can probably still succeed. If you take Belichick out, they would most likely regress on the field.
Brady has been carried by Belichick’s elite defenses, taking pressure off Brady on a regular basis and placing him and his offense in optimal positions to score. For example, in 2018 against a young and exciting Los Angeles Rams team, the Patriots defense held quarterback Jared Goff and his explosive offense to just 3 points. If you can’t win a Super Bowl after your defense allows just 3 points, then you don’t deserve to be in the Super Bowl. 
Brady got his sixth ring, but he clearly didn’t have to create much offense to get it. He was a  nonfactor during Super Bowl LIII and during the Patriots’ entire playoff run that season. Over two playoff games and the Super Bowl in 2018, Brady threw just two touchdowns and tacked on three interceptions, hardly the performance you’d expect from the greatest quarterback of all time.
Brady’s first Super Bowl team in 2001 had a similar storyline. His defense carried the team the entire season and the Pats were brought back from the dead by the infamous and now defunct “Tuck Rule.”
In 2004’s Super Bowl XXXIX against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots defense had three huge interceptions that gave them the upper hand throughout the course of the game. 
In 2015, Brady was bailed out again in the Super Bowl, this time against the Seattle Seahawks. Cornerback Malcolm Butler saved the day with a goal line interception when the Seahawks inexplicably did not hand the ball off to running back Marshawn Lynch to win the game.
Let’s also not forget the fact that New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning outplayed Brady in both of their Super Bowl matchups. In those games, Manning orchestrated two clutch game-winning drives while Brady played pretty average during both contests. 
Further proof of Belichick’s great coaching is the fact that every quarterback that has played in his system has succeeded. Former USC and Patriots quarterback Matt Cassel led the Pats to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth with Brady sidelined with a torn ACL in 2008. He also finished top 10 in touchdowns, passer rating and completion percentage. During Brady’s recent suspension for Deflategate, inexperienced quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett both showed a ton of promise as they lead the Patriots to a 3-1 record. 
What happened to those quarterbacks? Well, Cassel went to the Kansas City Chiefs, where he had a single winning season and never won more than four games the rest of his career. Brissett ended up on the Indianapolis Colts, where he didn’t throw for a touchdown in six of the last eight games this season. Garoppolo, on the other hand, is a different story as he now has the opportunity to win a Super Bowl this year as the starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. But like Brady, Garoppolo relies on the genius of his coach and arguably the best defense in the league to win — not to mention he threw eight passes in the NFC Championship Game.
Another knock against Brady is that he has been constantly surrounded by immense offensive talent. Wes Welker revolutionized the slot position. Randy Moss is one of the greatest receivers of all time. Rob Gronkowski was a generational talent and physical specimen who is also arguably the greatest to ever play his position. Adam Vinatieri and Stephen Gostkowski are two of the greatest kickers in NFL history. 
Other NFL quarterbacks in the GOAT conversation, like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers have had their share of offensive help. But most, if not all of their players were never on the same level as Welker, Gronkowski or Moss. 
These past couple seasons were some of the first in which Brady had a lack of offensive firepower in terms of receivers. How did Brady, the “GOAT,” respond?
This season, Brady had the 23rd best QBR out of all quarterbacks, the 35th most passing yards per attempt and the 36th highest completion percentage.
In 2018, Brady had the 14th best QBR, the 16th most yards per attempt and the 20th best completion percentage. Without the arsenal of offensive weapons Brady once had, he is no more than an average quarterback.
These are just a few of the many reasons that discredit Brady’s greatness, and I didn’t even have to get into cheating to prove my point. No quarterback in the history of the game has been surrounded by the kind of coaching, offensive talent and top-ranked defenses like Brady has, and for that reason, Brady does not deserve to be called the GOAT.

The USC men’s volleyball team is looking to snap its four-game losing streak this weekend at the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge hosted by Penn State. The Trojans will face Ohio State Friday and No. 10 Penn State Sunday.
This isn’t the Trojans’ first trip to the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge. Last year, USC took down both the Nittany Lions and the Buckeyes in hard-fought 3-2 matches. However, with the loss of key senior offensive players, this weekend carries no guarantee of similar success.
The Buckeyes are currently undefeated this season, consistently holding opponents under 20 points and only losing one set out of the season’s 16. 
While USC comes in with a 1-4 record, the Trojans have had a tougher pre-conference lineup that included a promising 3-2 win over No. 13 Princeton and a tight four-set loss to No. 4 Long Beach State last Friday.
USC has proven powerful at the net, averaging 10.5 kills per set. Junior middle blocker Kyle Gear leads the front row, logging double-digit kills in three games this season, while sophomore outside hitter Brandon Browning follows with a .226 offensive production rate.
With a roster consisting of just one senior and 15 underclassmen, an adjustment in offensive intensity from the high school level to college is expected in early season play. However, the Trojans’ offense depends on the defense providing for junior setter Chris Hall, meaning ball movement will have to be cleaner for hitters to finish the point.
Scouting Ohio State, its blocking efficiency explains much of the past runaway wins. Freshman middle blocker Samuel Clark was just named the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association Defensive Player of the Week after a decimating eight-block performance against Lincoln Memorial. Sophomore middle blocker Ethan Talley is three short of Clark with 16 total blocks in the season. For comparison, USC has a team total of 26 blocks. 
Looking at Penn State, its back row prowess is what earns the high ranking. The Nittany Lions’ aces have dismantled serve receptions, with their season total nearly triple that of their opponents’. Sophomore libero Will Bantle racked up 19 digs in a five-set comeback against No. 7 Lewis, a testament to the toughness this team has against high-level offenses.
The tournament host will provide a tough but necessary matchup to prepare the Trojans for Pac-12 conference play, which begins next week. If USC is hoping for a successful weekend, head coach Jeff Nygaard’s squad has to look back at its solo win strategy against Princeton to keep pace with the high-level competition the Trojans are expected to face. 
USC faces off against Ohio State at 10:30 a.m. Friday and Penn State at 10 a.m. Sunday.

The USC women’s basketball team will begin its season series against Washington State Friday at Galen Center. 
After a double-overtime 70-68 win against rival No. 10 UCLA that broke the Bruins’ five-game losing streak, the Trojans are looking to carry their momentum into the rest of conference play. 
USC leads WSU 50-18 in the all-time series and has won its last four games against the Cougars. However, WSU currently has a one-game edge over the Trojans in the Pac-12 with wins over California and Washington. 
WSU will look to senior forward Borislava Hristova to produce in the paint. Hristova currently leads the team with an average of 19.9 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.
Senior guard Chanelle Molina figures to lead WSU’s 3-point shooting effort as she is shootng 42.2% from beyond the arc this season. She has made 43 3-pointers this year, a team high.
WSU’s veteran squad will match up against a young USC team. Hristova will play against Pac-12 Freshman of the Week forward Alissa Pili, whose career-high 17-rebound performance against UCLA Friday proved pivotal in a tight win for the Trojans.
“I just play for my team and to win,” Pili said. “Honestly, my individual goal is not as big as what I want to achieve with my whole team and just our success winning this season.”
Senior forward Kayla Overbeck is expected to play a big role as well in Friday night’s game. At practice Wednesday, Overbeck was adamant about not underestimating the Cougars.
“[We focused on] keeping it at that standard [and] not letting it slide back down to how it was previously,” Overbeck said. “We had a really good week leading up to UCLA, and so keeping that foot-on-the-pedal type of mentality and mindset in every single week no matter who we play [is important].”
The Trojans have made improvements in their defensive effort — a focus of head coach Mark Trakh since repeated losses that resulted from scoring streaks by opponents early on in games.
USC is averaging 39.9 rebounds per game and had a dominant 52-rebound showing last week, and if the team wants to continue the trend, it’ll need Pili and Overbeck to box out the Cougars aggressively. 
The game against WSU also marks the end of a January home stretch for USC. After Friday night’s game, USC will face off against Washington before a three-and-a-half-week hiatus from Galen Center.  As the Trojans approach the halfway mark in conference play, these matchups will be crucial in digging the Trojans out of 11th place in the conference.
“Offensively or defensively, they got to be on their game,” Trakh said. “We were on our game, but now are we going to continue it? Have we learned how to play hard? We’ll see this weekend.”
USC will tip off at Galen Center against the Cougars Friday at 7 p.m.

Last week I sat at a Blue Chip function for the fraternity I am a member of, talking with potential new members. From the various conversations I had had with them, a unique line of questioning was directed at me, by many if not most of them. Of course, I was not entirely upset, nor were these questions unique to me and me alone but more so a constant reality of the daily experience of foreigners and expatriates:
A moment arises when a peer discovers they are talking to someone who is different, who in some ways is a bigger outsider than any of them have ever been. There is a glint of recognition that comes into their eyes, or a newfound sense of confidence in their strut, as they realize the idiosyncratic nature of a conversation where, although they might be the ones feeling out of place, they nonetheless find themselves playing on their home terrain. Suddenly they are the ones asking the tough questions, and I am the one trying to play a part. I might be the gatekeeper, but they are the ones who already belong.
In some bizarrely nostalgic manner, I harken back to an old childhood fear of aliens in my mind — hidden, menacing, mysterious, lurking in the shadows, walking among us, unbeknownst to all. Except, I am not the one watching out for them. The impostor within me panics — people are on to me, and my cover is under attack.
The conversations continue, and at some point my peers will invariably ask for my name, which usually leads to a semi-cringey, semi-awkward exchange — only semi because it has by now been normalized and ingrained into a part of my daily routine — of me repeating my name multiple times until they finally grasp it. Changing the intonations after every repetition in hopes that one might stick, that one of those repetitions can find heuristic relevance and relate to my audience, putting my full disposition in their shoes — hoping they might be willing and able to perhaps do the same.
And yet, these fraternity rush events are interesting, for while I am still very much the outsider in this arguably most American of environments at the University, it is these potential new members seeking to get in. And so, from a slightly higher vantage point, one is able to observe and learn a lot. These kids give me all of their cultural conventions, attempting to buy favor from my regard, and in observing their attempts I learn so much about their culture and how they think. 
Socialization, after all, teaches one the sociological constructions a group adheres to; teaches one to become an outright member of a place where they don’t necessarily belong. And with this understanding, my plight for developing cultural ambidexterity continues, aware that we were all born aliens.
Yes, we were all born aliens, and all it takes is for us to move to a slightly foreign environment to feel this once again. Just look at these kids trying to rush the house — how nervous and uncomfortable they look, like fish out of water.
Back at the Blue Chip Dinner, I am having a particularly enjoyable conversation with a peer from Charlotte, N.C., discussing “fit” in terms of universities and such — and in a rather quotidian exchange I refer to my experience in the greater Los Angeles area as “studying abroad.” The concept of fit becomes a little more obfuscated when all the potential fits are foreign to a student abroad — even more so now as I’m writing in a language that is not even my own. My friendly peer remarks surprise to realize that I am studying abroad, and welcomes me with a smile to his native land.
I smile at his surprise and gesture, for it is meant with kindness and perhaps only the slightest bit of naïveté. He is not trying to sound mean at how out of place a foreign kid such as myself might feel but instead surprised at how approachable and endearing my demeanor might be; how well I am able to play the part.
And through this conversation, I realize to my satisfaction that I have been quite successful in such a regard, of bringing the foreign into unexpected places and making it natural for it to sit there. For that is the thing about the foreign: It only remains such until one experiences it, shakes its hand, shares a laugh with it. Perhaps there are aliens living among us, but not to worry; for all we know, they might be more human than our own judging eyes trying to set them apart.

The beginning of Spring 2020 — with the inpour of new faces and those still round from home-cooked meals — is a time for second chances and new opportunities. Or not. 
Despite the state-wide drought, USC experienced a near constant rainfall of scandals last year. Although the University has survived into the next decade — still smelling of rain and glowing with the rosy dew of optimism — it’s not yet time to celebrate; not when there remains a building dedicated to a known eugenicist. Until President  Carol Folt takes real action toward renaming the building, the situation will remain as is: USC’s administration supports the segregationist sentiments propagated by Rufus von KleinSmid. 
Rufus von KleinSmid served as the University’s fifth president from 1921 to 1947, switching to the chancellor position for the last 17 years of his life. During that time, he oversaw the expansion of USC’s academic system, integrating 16 schools and eight buildings and tripling the student population. In his spare time, von KleinSmid went on to co-found the Human Betterment Foundation — a Pasadena-based organization promoting the “possibilities of race betterment by eugenic sterilization.” 
Prior to his appointment to the USC presidency, von KleinSmid had already made his name known in the realm of eugenics, publishing and presenting a paper titled “Eugenics and the State” at the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine in 1913. Some noteworthy lines from that paper include, “our defective classes breed like rabbits” and “the normal boy and girl have rights … to grasp from youth the fullest measure of what youthful life can gain without the hindering presence of those who can never help.”
At this point, multiple articles have been published exposing the former president for propagating  oppression and outright torture — for that is what involuntrary sterilization is: torture. We can therefore move past the stage of questioning whether von KleinSmid was racist. That is not up for debate. A debriefing of von KleinSmid’s history was included above for the sake of the reader. However, the events themselves are not the focus here, and it’s clear that the absurdity of it all has lost all shock value.
The About USC website offers a, should we say, sanitized version of history of the University’s former president, excluding any mention of von KleinSmid’s fervent advocacy for racism and oppression. This is a sound choice for the sake of advertisement but not as good for the preservation of truth and institutional integrity. In this haze of ignorance, USC hopefuls are led around campus, encouraged to admire the VKC building — and why would they not? It’s a beautiful building. With the towering globe statue and the array of flags representing international students’ home countries, it doesn’t look like it’s named after a depraved human being. 
President Folt entered her position with promises of progressive action and a total facelift for USC. However, the procedure seems to have been botched. Perhaps the physician wasn’t certified as advertised. There definitely weren’t any rave reviews from her previous employment. 
As chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Folt delayed the removal of the Silent Sam Confederate statue until after the majority of it had been torn down by student protesters. Her indecision gained no favor from either side in the arguments over the statue’s place on campus. Instead, it only sped up the process of her resignation. 
Coming to USC a few months later, Folt should have addressed VKC’s name change right away. With the campus in turmoil over the admissions scandals, there was a clear opportunity to increase morale among the student population by tackling a very visible problem. Instead, the president launched the Values Poll, which was a nicely wrapped distraction from the problem at hand, diverting attention from the student demonstrations which interrupted her inauguration.
This is not a matter of what the students want; students have advocated for the building’s renaming for years. Former USG Senator Preston Fregia presented a formal proposal and formed a committee focused on USC nomenclature two years ago. Put plainly, it is the University’s higher-ups who are the roadblock to the change of which USC is in dire need. 
Simply put: USC is protecting a eugenicist over its students — and it doesn’t look like that will change.

Indica or sativa? This is the age-old cannabis question. 
You’ll find a stark division between the stoners in each group, a clear delineation between vehement sativa supporters and earnest indica enthusiasts. The dilemma is pretty much one of the only things that’ll get stoners riled up — that and debating someone’s ability to roll. 
But, really, what’s all the smoke about?
In most — if not all — dispensaries, weed is divided into three broad categories: indica, sativa and hybrid. These are further divided into individual strains, which are the cannabis flower varieties categorized based on appearance, effect and chemical profile.
The pervading perception is that indica strains induce fatigue and are best suited for nighttime use, while sativa strains are energizing and invigorating, perfect for outdoor activities and creative, artistic initiatives. Hybrids seemingly offer a balance between the two, producing both indica and sativa effects.
The truth is, though, that these categories and strains are useless and misleading. Strain names are not reliable in predicting effects, flavors or moods and are nothing more than mere marketing ploys.
Take OG Kush, for example, one of the most popular strains in Southern Californian dispensaries. While OG Kush is often described as a euphoric and well-balanced strain, its chemical composition varies greatly from one dispensary to the next. Different harvesting, growing and processing methods result in different cannabinoid and terpene combinations — the two actual main factors responsible for a given strain’s effects.
So, why do we still categorize weed — a substance used for its medicinal and state-of-mind-altering properties — incorrectly? The problem is twofold: historical plant classifications became warped over time and cannabis entered the mainstream without proper standardization or research into its strains’ myriad effects. 
In the 18th century, the terms indica and sativa were used to classify different cannabis species: Cannabis sativa described hemp plants from Europe cultivated for fiber and seed production and Cannabis indica referred to psychoactive plants from India that were used to make hashish. 
But today most of the cannabis strains we consume stem from Cannabis indica, and yet, with the mass commercialization and rapid legalization of cannabis, the incorrect names stuck. While sativa refers to tall, narrow-leaf varieties of cannabis and indica refers to short, broad-leaf plants, both are technically varieties of Cannabis indica. Even then, this distinction is only relevant to cannabis growers.
Strains’ effects are actually dependent on a number of different scientific factors, including chemical composition, dosage, consumption method and one’s personal tolerance and biology. Hundreds of unique chemical compounds in one strain interact with each other in a complex, not yet fully comprehended, way to produce a symphony of experiences.
Cannabinoids like cannabidiol, known as CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, are among the main drivers of strains’ effects. CBD, a non-psychoactive compound, is useful for reducing anxiety, pain and inflammation, while THC, a psychoactive compound, is well-suited for relieving nausea, inducing sleep and getting high. Terpenes, the aromatic compounds in weed (and by extension, all plants), are what determine strains’ smells, be it citrus, berries or even cheese.
According to Jeffrey Raber, a chemist who founded the first independent cannabis terpenes testing lab, strains’ energizing or sedating effects seem to mainly be influenced by terpenes and their relative ratios to both each other and cannabinoids. 
Previously, it was thought that CBD caused sedation, indicas had higher CBD levels and that the same was true for the THC and sativa relationship. On the contrary, indicas and sativas exhibit similar levels of THC and CBD, meaning that some so-called indicas can be energizing while some sativas are sedating.
“There is no factual or scientific basis to making these broad sweeping recommendations, and it needs to stop today,” said Raber in response to the misinformation at dispensaries in an interview with Leafly. “What we need to seek to understand better is which standardized cannabis composition is causing which effects, when delivered in which fashions, at which specific dosages, to which types of [consumers].”
Basically, all you thought you knew about weed is a lie. So, what can you do?
While research has yet to answer questions about how terpenes and their various combinations affect cannabis strains — and therefore you — and if similar cannabinoid and terpene combinations across different strains cause similar effects, we can start by choosing weed based on different, correct criteria. 
That is, until the industry catches up and standardizes its products.
Choose THC-dominant strains if you’re on the hunt for a euphoric, energizing experience or if you’re looking to alleviate insomnia or depression. CBD-dominant strains are better suited for treating muscle pain and are a great alternative if you’re prone to anxiety with THC-dominant strains. Balanced THC and CBD strains offer the perfect balance of a mild high accompanied by symptom relief.
Upon entering the overwhelmingly large cannabis space, it’s no doubt convenient to choose products based on pre-existing indica, sativa and hybrid categorizations, especially when that’s all budtenders go off of. 
Finding the right strain, or strains, requires experience, knowledge and a bit of research. Go based off of the THC and CBD content and, if you can, smell the flower to get a sense of the terpenes. Consider things like your cannabis tolerance level, the length of your desired effects and your susceptibility to paranoia and anxiety when picking out your strain in whatever consumption form.
Over time, and with some trial and error, you will become more adept at picking the strain that’s right for you.

It’s summer at the USC Fisher Museum of Art as bold colors take over in a new exhibition. The monumental abstractions of renowned Venice Beach artist Charles “Chuck” Arnoldi invite viewers to think outside the box and paint outside the lines. 
The “Charles Arnoldi | Four Decades” exhibition opened to the public Tuesday at the museum, featuring the innovative and abstract works of Arnoldi over the span of his nearly 50-year career.
Arnoldi’s abstractions are permanent fixtures in more than 45 museums across the United States, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. USC will host more than two dozen Arnoldi paintings and sculptures in the museum until April 4. Each work was handpicked by curator Bruce Guenther from the holdings of the Jordan D. Schnitzer Family Foundation, which includes 200 pieces by Arnoldi.
This is the first time the foundation has lent a part of its collection to the Fisher Museum. For Schnitzer, director of the foundation, the Arnoldi exhibition hits close to home in both a literal and figurative sense. 
“What I tell people about art is ‘feel it, don’t think it,’” he said. “The first time I saw [Arnoldi’s] work 20, 25 years ago, I didn’t have to think about what it is. I just thought, ‘God, is this good.’ And I’ve not stopped collecting his work ever since.” 
Provost Dr. Charles “Chip” Zukoski agreed, deeming Arnoldi’s art to be an important educational tool. 
“Visual literacy, the ability to see patterns and color, to connect the observations to emotions and ideas that cannot be expressed in words… [is] an important part of being an educated member of our society,” Zukoski said. “The work of Charles Arnoldi is, for me, arresting, startling and ables me to see connections and patterns both within the art and when I look away at the … environment around me.” 
The exhibition tracks Arnoldi’s authenticity in many manifestations over the years, from acrylic on canvas to his famous branchwork to cast bronze sculptures. Schnitzer considered the integration of Arnoldi’s diverse portfolio to be an important characteristic of the exhibition. To him, Arnoldi’s natural evolution was crucial to his success as an artist. 
“What I like about [Arnoldi’s] work is, first, he was a conceptual artist when that was emerging, with the early stick work that’s very minimal and so forth, and yet he’s kept pushing himself,” Schnitzer said. “Not reinventing himself but pushing himself … and therefore providing us with new expressions of an amazing creative mind.”
Arnoldi, who experienced the exhibition for the first time Sunday alongside donors at the opening reception, was also pleased by its seamless transition from decade to decade. 
“You have infinite possibilities,” Arnoldi said. “And the truth is, everything in here, even though they look radically different, if I hadn’t done all of this [earlier work], I could have never done that [later work].”
In the Arnoldi exhibition, feeling precedes figure. Arnoldi breathes life into everything from the intersecting freeways of Los Angeles to the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens, utilizing lines and colors, wood and paint to invoke a unique emotion for each one of his piece’s viewers.
Figurative artist Dan McCleary will interview Arnoldi regarding his work, practice and career at the USC Fisher Museum Feb. 1. The museum will also host a site visit to Arnoldi’s Venice Beach studio March 3 for a behind-the-scenes look into his process. 
Selma Holo, director of the Fisher Gallery, hopes to close the exhibition in April with the installation of an Arnoldi sculpture featured at the museum nearly 40 years ago.
“At Fisher in 1984 … we had the ‘Olympic Sculpture Show’ where Chuck Arnoldi was the absolute star,” she told donors. “With luck, and a little fundraising, we will reinstall that sculpture at a closing event for Chuck’s show in early April.” 
Holo was met by eager applause and one emphatic whistle. 
USC affiliates can view “Charles Arnoldi | Four Decades” over the next two months.

After meeting through Spark SC in 2016, three  Iovine and Young Academy students came up with a plan. Senior Mimi Tran Zambetti and alumni Landon Brand and Benjamin Stanfield, who graduated in 2019, created Project Wren, a startup program aimed at helping consumers offset their carbon footprint. 
Changing directions from their plans to develop a company involving human resource software, they created the startup to help with current climate change movements. 
The app, which was created in June, has grown to a consumer base of more than 1,000 subscribers and has raised more than $1.6 million through fundraising in the seven months since its launch.
“[We wanted to focus] not on what we thought could make a good business but … what we really knew we could build and enjoy building,” Stanfield said. “That’s ultimately what brought us to climate change because it’s something we are really passionate about.”
Wren creators said the app aims to support consumers who are unsure about what steps to take to reduce their carbon footprint but wish to become active in conservation efforts. 
“[Our users are] busy people who have jobs that are really demanding, so they won’t necessarily have a ton of time [to volunteer],” Zambetti said. “Subscribing to Wren is an easy way to get started with acting on climate change for a lot of these people.”
Subscribers can offset emissions by making a monthly contribution to one of Wren’s three partnership programs that aim to make local climate impacts abroad. Partners include the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program, a community tree planting project in East Africa; Mandulis Energy, a small NGO in northern Uganda that provides clean energy to Ugandan refugees; and the Rainforest Foundation US, an organization that uses drones and satellite imagery to monitor deforestation in the Amazon rainforest for indigenous groups to report to local officials. 
“A lot of the solutions already exist — they’re just lacking funding,” Zambetti said. “The other side of it is that there’s a lot of individuals who have a lot of pent-up desire to do something about climate change, like change their lifestyle and become more active in the political spheres. We decided to connect the two.”
Once a user subscribes, Wren sends detailed updates to them every two weeks to delineate how the money is being spent. 
“One of the reasons offsets aren’t really mainstream is there’s sort of a lack of trust and transparency in the space,” Zambetti said. “You give money, and it’s almost like one of those black-box donations where you’re not really sure how your money is being spent or where it’s going. The thing we try to do at Wren is give a clear idea of where your money is going.”
Project Wren subscriber Derrick Morales said he began contributing to the company to help with the current climate crisis and donate to organizations that sequester greenhouse gas emissions. 
“I appreciate Wren because I know the money I give to the company is actually going toward some form of carbon sequestration — in this case, in the form of tropical rainforest preservation,” Morales said. 
Project Wren plans to expand its sustainability efforts and grow its audience, Zambetti said.
“We’d really like to become the one-stop shop for people to act on climate change, and basically growing from a simple calculation offset service to the easiest way for anyone tackling the climate crisis,” Zambetti said. “Whether that’s offsetting the carbon footprint, finding ways to reduce their carbon footprint, finding local chapters, we would support [them].”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the organization as Rainforest Foundation Fund. The name of the foundation is Rainforest Foundation US. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

A television journalist, the co-host of “Pod Save the World” and the director of Hill Research Consultants have joined the Center for the Political Future as fellows to teach courses on political trends and media leading up to the 2020 elections.
Jeff Greenfield, a journalist and analyst for CBS, ABC and CNN; Ben Rhodes, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who hosts a weekly foreign affairs podcast; and David Hill, a pollster who runs a marketing research firm, will each host talks with students about their professional experience and opinions on current issues throughout the semester. 
Greenfield teaches Political Media in the United States and aims to show students how politicians use the media to advance their agendas and how changes in the media have impacted political life.
“It’s my way of speaking in a history course even though I’m not a credentialed history professor,” Greenfield said. “Since I’ve been covering politics for a lot of decades, what I lived through is now history so some of what I teach I’ve actually observed.”
In addition to his role as a political analyst for national news sources, Greenfield has authored 13 books on politics, media and culture. 
Hill’s course, titled Understanding Political Culture’s Role in Campaign Messaging, will focus on how culture influences political narratives and campaigns. Hill said he hopes his class will allow students to consider and challenge their political opinions. 
“Making people see where opinions come from and think about it differently than how they thought before may give them an opportunity to better see another person’s point of view,” Hill said.
Rhodes’ course, titled “The Global Authoritarian Trend: Strategies and Opposition,” examines the rise of authoritative leaders in democratic spaces around the world and the approaches countries have taken to combat them. While his experience can be helpful to students, Rhodes said he hopes to learn new perspectives from them and the University community. 
While the Department of Political Science and International Relations screened through the fellows, Bob Shrum and Mike Murphy, the co-directors of the Center, made the final decision. Shrum said he chose the fellows based on their political experience, partisan balance and availability.
“[We were] looking for people who are interested in students, who had deep, wide experience in politics, who will make the commitment to be on campus for 10 weeks … and engage with students,” Shrum said.
“I think it’s important for people like me to go out of our way to hear the perspective of young people because there’s a risk of getting detached from the generations coming behind you,” he said. “I look forward to being informed and revitalized by the experience of being in the classroom and in the University community.”
This is the second year that CPF has invited fellows to teach courses at USC. 
“The fellows bring a special perspective,” Shrum said. “They can enrich the education of students because they’ve been out there in the real world — in the trenches — and they add an extra dimension to what students learn.”

Spotify Chief Content Officer Dawn Ostroff discussed the company’s expansion into podcasts, female inclusion in the industry and the Spotify business model at the Wallis Annenberg Hall forum Thursday. The event was part of Annenberg Career Center’s Lunch with a Leader series. 
Ostroff, whose entertainment industry experience includes founding Condé Nast Entertainment and serving as president of entertainment for The CW, said she decided to join the streaming company after realizing the impact audio — particularly podcasts — was going to have in the current age and the challenges she would face as part of a platform that was available globally. 
“I personally feel they single-handedly changed the music business by having Spotify,” Ostroff said. “I felt that streaming platform is so dynamic — although it’s music right now, I knew [it] was going to expand into podcasts. The medium of audio is exploding, especially among young people.”
Ostroff asked students in the audience whether they listened to AM radio or if they had listened to at least one podcast in the past month, trying to prove what statistics had already shown: the emergence of podcasts as a medium to connect with audiences. 
“This room reflects the statistics that we’re seeing,” Ostroff said. “Just to give you an idea, 67% of the people in the U.S. are now getting their audios and 42% of the 18- to 34-year-olds in our country are listening to a podcast once a day or once a week, and that number is growing very quickly. So, you’re seeing a huge spike in this new medium.”
Ostroff also mentioned that Spotify will sponsor the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study on women in music. She discussed the importance of equal representation in the industry and the way Spotify has been working toward inclusion.  
“Our own music team at Spotify now has not only gender equality but we have 51% women, which is a great accomplishment by our entire team,” Ostroff said. “Women need to be more fairly represented in many areas, so I do think that there is a lot of opportunity to still be had.”
Ostroff also answered an audience question on Spotify’s business model and whether creators were paid well through the self-placed advertisements and the company’s payment for original content. 
“We are in the business in order to allow a million creators to earn a living off of their art by connecting them with a billion users, right? That’s the core of the entire company,” Ostroff said. “We pay money to the creators to make those podcasts, and we sell the ads, so it’s always about how do we support the community and help the creators.”
