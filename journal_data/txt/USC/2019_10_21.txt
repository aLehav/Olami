Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli are no longer enrolled at USC, USC Registrar confirmed Monday. Their disenrollment follows the revelations of Operation Varsity Blues, in which their parents, actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Massimo Giannulli, were accused of paying $500,000 to secure their daughters’ admission to USC as false crew recruits. 
Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose are two of nearly three dozen students at USC involved in the college admissions scandal at USC. Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli both pleaded not guilty in April. Neither Olivia Jade nor Isabella Rose participated in crew at USC.
The University said it was unable to provide additional information regarding Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose’s disenrollment due to student privacy laws. It directed the Daily Trojan to an informational page on its website last updated Aug. 12. 
“We are continuing to work through a very thorough, deliberative process for each student case under review,” the page read.  “Each of the students is entitled to a fair and impartial process as detailed in our policies, and we are taking the time needed to make sure that those processes are followed carefully.”
The University is currently investigating students involved in the scheme. Though there is an ongoing investigation for some students, some of those under review have been notified of the determinations of their cases following an investigative process USC completed in mid-June. Students admitted through the bribery scheme in the most recent admissions cycle were denied admission to the University earlier this year.
USC placed holds on the accounts of students under investigation in March, but students who agreed to fully cooperate in the review of their cases were permitted to enroll in classes for the fall semester. The hold would still prevent them from obtaining a degree or acquiring transcripts while their cases are under review.
Students under investigation are reviewed by the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.

Though Hahn Plaza was bustling with students rushing to and from classes, meetings and dining halls, there was a moment of peace tucked at the base of Tommy Trojan Monday night. Nearly a dozen people held electric candles as part of the Academic Culture Assembly’s Candlelight Vigil and spoke freely about mental health, as part of a series of events for Mental Health Awareness Month.
“Lighting the candles symbolizes that we’re honoring people who have struggled with mental illness, as well as struggled with any type of mental health issues,” said Raveena Ghanshani, the co-associate assistant director of special events for the Academic Culture Assembly. “I know that we have all faced stressful situations in our lives, but this is kind of a way for us to come together as a community and talk about these, as well as be comfortable with each other as a community to talk about these things.”
The Academic Culture Assembly is an Undergraduate Student Government programming assembly that hosts a series of events every year honoring Mental Health Awareness Month. Ghanshani, a senior majoring in biological sciences, placed stress balls, packs of tissues and flyers advertising the Engemann Student Health Center’s mental health resources on a table for attendees to take. 
Varun Soni, dean of religious life, opened the event by speaking about how college students feel pressure from a culture of perfection. 
“Students come to USC having dreamed about this place their whole life. When they get to campus, it’s the end of a long journey of sacrifice and hard work,” Soni said. “But what I see is that when students get to campus, it’s not all fun and games. It’s not always the brochure that they saw. It’s not always the idyllic experience, because the reality is that being in college is tough and can be a traumatic experience.”
Soni asked students to take a moment of silence to honor students who have suffered from mental illness, loneliness and isolation. He then emphasized that Diwali, the multi-day Indian festival of lights, is approaching and reminded students to value their own accomplishments and positive qualities.
“All week, people will be lighting candles all over the world,” he said. “When we light candles this week, we are reminded of our own inner light.”
Kelly Greco, assistant director of outreach and prevention services at Engemann, also spoke on the importance of maintaining hope. 
“For me, when I look at this candle … it is a symbol of hope, and that’s why we light candles,” Greco said. “What gives us hope, and how do we have that conversation, not just checking in with ourselves but to have that conversation with other people?”
USG President Trenton Stone and Vice President Mahin Tahsin spoke about the pressures of student leadership and how genuinely checking in with peers on campus is an important step in fostering community.
“Sometimes it’s OK to say ‘I’m not OK’ or ‘I’m not doing well,’” Stone said. “That doesn’t always mean you have to seek out services or whatever it might be, but it’s just accepting that we’re not always OK every day. Especially as student leaders, we don’t need to look perfect every single day and be setting that example all the time.”
The vigil comes at a difficult time for the USC community, with an increasing demand for counseling after multiple students passed away earlier this semester. The vigil concluded with a chance for students to raise questions, concerns and thoughts on how to better improve campus wellness.
“When you think about this place, you’re going to think about the people,” Soni said. “You’re not going to think about the classes, you’re not going to think about the [USC] Village, the building, the statues … What you actually think about, what you actually miss, what you actually embrace when you leave are the people. The people make the place.”

The USC Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies honored Sara Blakely, CEO and founder of Spanx, as 2019’s Entrepreneur of the Year at Town and Gown Monday. Blakely spoke about her experience in business and discussed how femininity inspires her company’s image.
Greif Center Executive Director David Belasco moderated the discussion with Blakely, which was attended by nearly 500 people. Belasco led the conversation by asking Blakely about her history as an entrepreneur.
Blakely, a Florida native, started her entrepreneurial career by going door-to-door selling fax machines. According to Blakely, she was met with years of rejection and failure, but that did not discourage her from continuing her sales venture.
Blakely remained confident in the face of these failures and even embraced them. She attributes this steadfast determination to her father, a trial attorney, who raised her and her brother to embrace failure.
“He was redefining failure for me,” Blakely said. “So, failure for my brother and me didn’t become about the outcome, it became about not trying.” 
Blakely encountered a crucial aspect of sales throughout her years of failures and rejections. 
“One of the most important things in being a great salesperson is being a great listener,” Blakely said.
Listening allowed her to think critically about the needs of the customer and to approach business as a way of thought. Blakely commented on the difference between schooling and business in their approach to thought.
“I realized that I had just spent  16 years of my life in school being taught what to think, but no one had ever taught me how to think. It never dawned on me that I could actually control how I think,” Blakely said.
Blakely realized this after her father provided her with tapes on motivational speaking in the wake of the death of her friend. She would carry this understanding throughout her career, inspiring creativity and innovation.
Eventually, Blakely became inspired to create her clothing brand, Spanx, after cutting the feet off a pair of pantyhose to wear to a party. After some difficulties getting off the ground, her product and the eventual brand became a household name. 
Blakely focused her business of solving clothing issues that women had previously encountered. In fact, she acknowledged at a young age that she wanted to help women and said she was inspired by her mother and grandmother. Belasco recognizes the ties between this realization and how she founded Spanx.
“Sara’s larger purpose is woven into the fabric of her company,” Belasco said. 
Blakely’s goal with her business is to balance femininity and masculinity in fashion. She said the world’s issues between men and women are less about gender and more about energy.
“We all have male and female energy inside of our bodies … and I feel like the feminine has been suppressed  for a while, probably for about 3,000 years. I feel like everyone will all be better served when the feminine and male is more balanced,” Blakely said.
In 2012, Forbes named Blakely the world’s youngest, independent female billionaire. During the same year, Time recognized her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2013, Blakely signed onto the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic organization founded by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, promising to donate half of her wealth to charity.
Blakely concluded the discussion by providing her thoughts on how money affects a person.
“Money just makes you more of who you already were,” Blakely said.

The World Series is here, folks! 
After a long regular season punctuated by some exciting playoff series, the field is down to two teams: the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros. 
At first glance, this matchup seems to have a clear favorite and underdog. Houston won 107 out of 162 games during the regular season, compared to Washington’s 93 victories. The Nationals are a Wild Card team that has been fighting to keep its season alive for weeks, while the Astros have been World-Series-or-bust all season. But the story isn’t quite so simple.
Let’s go back to May 23. The Nationals were off to a terrible start, with a 19-31 record. Many fans were prepared to throw in the towel, sell at the trade deadline and start crossing their fingers for 2020. The Astros, on the other hand, were already 15 games over .500 and had all but secured a playoff spot in October. After May 23, though, the Astros went 73-37 and the Nationals played just as well, with a record of 74-38. In other words, this is a matchup between two teams that have been dominating their competition and deserve to be in the World Series.
Let’s begin by looking at each team’s starting pitchers. Both teams boast three starters with a Rolling Game Score above 56, according to FiveThirtyEight. This statistic measures the quality of a starting pitcher on a scale from 0-100 by predicting how they would fare in a “typical start.” A score of 50 is considered average. These two teams are the only ones in the league with three starters over 56, so we are in for a treat. Those numbers don’t even count Nationals pitcher Anibal Sanchez, who threw five no-hit innings in Game 2 against the Cardinals.
The Astros’ trio of aces consists of Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zach Greinke, all of whom have been the best pitcher in baseball at some point in their career and were acquired by the Astros via trades. Cole led the league this season with an absurd 13.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched. Earlier in the postseason, he broke the record for most consecutive innings with a strikeout at 73. Verlander led all pitchers in wins above replacement, an overall value statistic calculated by Baseball Reference. Greinke is among the best in the league at avoiding hard contact — his exit velocity of only 86.8 mph is the lowest of the Astros’ three aces. The Nationals batters will certainly have their hands full with this trio at the mound.
On the Nationals’ side of things, pitchers Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg are bona fide aces, and Patrick Corbin sure did pitch like one in 2019. All three are top 10 in the league in strikeouts this season, finishing with 243, 251 and 238, respectively. This is particularly remarkable for Scherzer, who missed a couple of weeks in July and August with a back injury. Strasburg and Scherzer are also both above the 90th percentile in xSLG, a statistic that calculates the expected slugging percentage allowed by a pitcher based on the exit velocities and launch angles of the hitter. Overall, I expect the starting pitching to be exceptional from both teams this series, with a slight edge to the Astros.
At the plate, both teams have multiple studs who present many problems. The Astros boast big-name players like infielders Alex Bregman, Carlos Correa and Jose Altuve and outfielder George Springer. Bregman has made a strong case for American League MVP this season, leading the AL in WAR for position players and coming in second only to Angels’ outfielder Mike Trout in on-base percentage. Springer almost single-handedly won the World Series for the Astros when they beat the Dodgers in 2017 (No, I’m not over it — thanks for asking). 
Outfielder Yordan Alvarez has been crushing it since he was called up from the minors midseason, with an xSLG in the 98th percentile.
The Nationals have outfielder Juan Soto and infielder Anthony Rendon, who have carried the team on their backs for most of the season. Soto is one of baseball’s best young stars; he’s put up two of the best seasons ever by a 19- and 20-year old over the past two years. Rendon has long been one of baseball’s underrated talents, as he excels in practically every category at the plate and on defense. These two stars will get their chances to shine on baseball’s biggest stage. 
Other contributors for the Nationals this year have been infielder Howie Kendrick, outfielder Adam Eaton and infielder Trea Turner. I’m afraid the edge at the plate still goes to the Astros, although once again it is only a slight edge.
Coming out of the bullpen, Houston has had better relief than Washington during both the regular season and the playoffs. Ryan Pressly and Roberto Osuna are the Astros’ key relievers, but Pressly has struggled in the postseason. The Astros have great bullpen depth, though.
The Nationals’ best relievers are Sean Doolittle, Fernando Rodney and Daniel Hudson, who have all been solid through the postseason. Rodney has not allowed a run in the playoffs, but his WHIP of 1.615 in 2019 suggests he lacks consistency. It appears as though the battle of the bullpens slightly favors Houston.
Houston has a more well-rounded roster than Washington, with an advantage in nearly every aspect of the game. I predict the series will be decided by the starting pitching — if Houston can get to Strasburg or Scherzer, it should be able to take care of business, but it will be in trouble if the Nationals are able to put up runs on Cole or Verlander. Logically, the Astros should win in as few as five games, but I’ll be rooting for the Nationals to take it in seven.

Coming off a narrow loss to Utah, USC women’s volleyball had two commanding victories this past weekend, defeating Oregon State 3-1 before sweeping Oregon 3-0.
The two wins improved the Trojans’ record to 11-7 on the season and 5-3 in conference play, bringing the team to sixth in the Pac-12 standings.
All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier tallied 36 kills throughout the weekend. She became fourth all-time in career kills for USC with 1,705, passing Jasmina Marinkovic, who played from 1995 to 1998.
Due to injuries and player resignations, the Trojans made the trip to Oregon with only nine active players. Freshman libero Keila Barra stepped in as a defensive specialist for the injury-riddled team. She made a career-high nine digs versus Oregon State and continued her breakout weekend with six more digs against Oregon.
“I think Keila Barra did probably one of the best jobs this weekend of … finding her new role,” senior libero Raegan LeGrand said. 
While Barra flashed her future potential, LeGrand will maintain her starting libero role after notching 23 digs against Oregon State and 17 digs against Oregon.  
After taking over the starting spot Oct. 8, LeGrand has proven to be a huge impact player for the USC defense, totaling 20-plus digs in three games. LeGrand’s defensive efforts have helped USC to a 4-2 record while she has started, with both losses coming in close five-set matches.
Against Oregon, LeGrand made a statement with 12 digs in the first set, which made the Oregon hitter shy away in later sets. As a result, LeGrand had just four digs in the second set and one in the third.
“As the libero, you’re just kind of frustrated because you obviously want them to hit [the ball] to you,” LeGrand said.  
Although the Ducks tried to take LeGrand out of the game, her stellar performance opened up other opportunities for her teammates to get involved in the passing game, resulting in double-digit kill games for Lanier and senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross.  
LeGrand also pointed out the solid offensive and defensive performance of freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske. Weske had 12 digs to go along with eight kills against Oregon. 
One particularly bright spot during the weekend came during Sunday’s first set. Down 19-22, head coach Brent Crouch took a timeout to rally his team for the final points of the set. Out of the timeout, USC won 4 straight points to take the lead and eventually win the game 25-23.
USC’s defense put forth a solid overall effort this weekend. Against Oregon State, the Trojans made 70 digs and stalwarted the Beaver’s hitters, who put up a low .145 hitting percentage. The Ducks hit even worse as the USC defense held them to .136 during the match.
“Something our coach Brent [Crouch] has really instilled in us the past two weeks is we don’t have to do spectacular plays, and we also can’t really afford crazy bad plays,” LeGrand said. “As long as we make consistent good plays, then we are on the right track.” 
The Trojans’ only fault defensively was their service defense, as they allowed 11 aces against Oregon and eight against Oregon State.
At the end of the day, USC gained two much-needed Pac-12 wins that will help put the team on the right track as they prepare to face the two top teams in the Pac-12 next weekend: Stanford and Cal.  
“These games could really change the rest of the season, and obviously they are two of the best in the conference, but they are also two of the best in the country,” LeGrand said. “I think it can help us with confidence … going forward and showing that we’re here to stay.” 
USC has already shown that it can beat a top 10 team after beating then-No. 8 Washington, but to achieve that feat again, the team must maintain more consistency. While they have shown flashes of brilliance, the Trojans have failed to perform to their full potential at times throughout the year, especially with the recent slew of injuries.  
Although USC has been having a rough year, this season is far from over. The Trojans have yet to play their second round of conference matches, where they will look to climb up the Pac-12 rankings.

Most children worship celebrities, actors, artists or even activists. Ten-year-old Johannes Betzler, however, worships Adolf Hitler — an idol not unheard of for children in 1940s Nazi Germany. Raised in a small German town, he attends a Nazi education camp, learning how to become a good soldier for Hitler’s army.
The latest film from Taika Waititi (best known for directing “Thor: Ragnarok”), “Jojo Rabbit” opens to the life of a typical German schoolchild — well, as typical as attending a Nazi-era summer training camp can be. Instead of playing with toys, learning how to make friendship bracelets or canoeing in the river, the children burn books, throw knives and talk about killing European soldiers.
“Jojo Rabbit” portrays this as normalized behavior in the 1940s, satirically changing the historically vicious German army leaders into role models for the German children. It’s an ambitious but subtly strong concept — few have merged historical tragedies with high school comedy tropes. The most popular example would be Roberto Benigni’s “Life is Beautiful” in 1997.
Johannes, the film’s protagonist, is given the unfortunate nickname “Jojo Rabbit” — not as an endearing term but for his inability to kill a rabbit and prove his cold-hearted Nazi strength. Luckily for Jojo, he has an imaginary friend who takes the form of Hitler, accompanying him, guiding him and cheering him up along the way. A sort-of-motivational speaker, director Waititi, who plays Hitler, embodies himself as a hilariously whimsical, mocking vision of the genocidal Nazi leader. Waititi brings a positive energy, one that would not be seen from the eyes of most but would make sense given Johannes’ perspective.
The movie takes a dark turn as Jojo discovers that his mother is hiding Elsa, a Jewish girl, in their house. Even though the film begins with a lighter tone — under the guise of a typical coming-of-age story — the realities of the Nazi regime begin to eclipse the family, ushering a heavier atmosphere into the story. The dangers of hiding a Jewish person rarely need to be explained; Jojo must find a way to balance his new discovery with the teachings of the Nazi regime. Waititi does not sugarcoat anything, as the audience is quickly forced into reality, realizing that Johannes’ childhood is quickly over. In one turning point, Waititi effectively destroys Johannes’ childhood, symbolizing the effects of war and violence on children. Teasing and humanizing Hitler is no longer the main theme of the film.
There are romantic moments between Elsa and Johannes, but in the end, she becomes the mother that Johannes lost. He kicks away his reliance on imaginary Hitler and the loyalty and tribalism that he represents. Waititi attempts to intersect aspects of a teenager’s growth with the most dangerous part of the world in a truly “outcast vs. the world” situation. While this is mostly played for laughs, Waititi’s message (though it may be a tried-and-true “love conquers all” conclusion) is effectively portrayed.
The initially sweet scenes in the film quickly become despondent as Waititi unloads one tragedy after another. Continually losing the most important aspects of his life — his ability to serve, his mother and his loyalty — should have crushed him long ago, yet he still stands. Johannes’ bravery stands for much more than just emotional growth. It represents his iron will and persistence, despite the destruction of his normal childhood. 
Ironically, Waititi has input the very essence of the American dream into Jojo’s character, making him the beacon of American values like love and friendship in a world of Nazi rule. The events may be exaggerated, but the message definitely is not. He’s the representation of the nerdy outcast that many have identified with in their childhoods, making his situation something that many can sympathize with and, consequently, learn from.

Summer Walker gave fans a forewarning during her NPR Tiny Desk performance this past week. “Look, I’m really freaking excited to be here but I have social anxiety like a motherfucker,” Walker shared with the room. “I’m freaking the hell out, I’m sweating, but this is so exciting for me. I watch this show all the time.” Despite the notice, Twitter users found her performance abysmal and commented on her perceived lack of energy.
The R&B songstress isn’t the first artist to publicly speak on mental health or to be criticized for how their mental health condition perpetuates in their artistry. In his book “ZAYN,” former One Direction member Zayn Malik discussed anxiety in conjunction with his rise to fame. 
“When I was in One Direction, my anxiety issues were huge, but within the safety net of the band, they were at least manageable,” he said. “As a solo performer, I felt much more exposed, and the psychological stress of performing had just got to be too much for me to handle — at that moment, at least.”
Similarly, “Talk” singer Khalid took to Twitter last year to detail his social anxiety: “Going out in public is a little hard, being recorded non stop, everyone staring at you and shit.” 
What is particularly significant about artists such as Walker and Khalid detailing their struggles with mental health is how their experiences redefine how we discuss mental health and people with high visibility. 
Struggles with anxiety, along with other mental illnesses, have often been regarded as “white people” issues or a set of experiences only felt by the privileged. But according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, Black adults are 20% more likely to report severe psychological distress than white adults. Black adults are also more likely to have feelings of sadness, hopelessness and worthlessness than adult whites. 
What Summer Walker and Khalid experience isn’t unique to them because they are celebrities, but it’s something more common in the daily lives of Black people. The two artists have unintentionally sparked conversations about the struggles of Black people operating in the public sphere. And in support of Summer Walker, many Black women on the internet opened up about their anxiety and depression being disregarded as an attitude problem, as just being angry or standoff-ish.  
The facts tell us mental health issues within the Black community are not rare, and we shouldn’t be surprised when artists like Walker are forthcoming about their struggles because similar experiences are woven into the music we love. Think of Kanye’s “I Thought About Killing You,” or a host of songs by Kid Cudi. 
Despite this commonality, there is a continued set of expectations placed on artists, particularly Black ones, to consistently show up as “perfect” for the public eye. 
Based on previous interviews and performances, Summer Walker has been labeled as rude, boring and unapproachable. And even with knowledge of her anxiety in mind, there is continued criticism of the singer concerning her public persona. 
It seems that as fans and consumers, we operate under the assumption that our favorite artists owe us a level of performance and visibility, which isn’t always true. Artists are not robots to be fine-tuned, and neither are they products of large companies and corporations with a return policy to adhere to when something goes astray. 
Criticism of Walker is reminiscent of how Amy Winehouse was dissected by the public during her very public struggles with fame. Due to her bulimia and alcohol abuse, she often staggered drunk on stage, and her voice, known for its soul and power, sounded empty. Audiences booed her, concerts were stopped midway and whole tours were canceled — for “health reasons,” according to her management. At the time, tabloids and the media spun her health issues into glamorized celebrity gossip. Her sickness was not met with seriousness or compassion. 
Although Walker’s experiences are not wholly parallel to Winehouse’s, their fame impedes on the empathy they receive in a similar fashion. Celebrity dissolves no person from struggling with addiction, anxiety or depression and how that manifests in their work is not something for us to critique or poke fun at. 
As society continues to remove the stigma surrounding mental health issues, we must support celebrities and high-profile figures who deal with these issues rather than acting as if they should meet our expectations in light of them.

If you mention Garfield, Minecraft or The Sims, be prepared to watch 20-year-old Rudy Falagán light up.  
Take The Sims video game, for example, which explores agency and identity in video games.
“I’m using [Sims] in the future to talk about the idea of reality stars or content creators and this idea of drama and kind of just what that means for them to be in that weird position,” Falagán said. “We want them to have some sort of autonomy and identity, but at the same time, we want drama when we want drama, and we want them to post specific types of content.” 
A junior in the Roski School of Art and Design, Falagán uses video art to explore some of his favorite entertainment topics, like video games and social media.
Falagán screen-records multiple laptop desktops and his phone to produce edited videos that explore human interactions with digital spaces. He often works with three different screens at once, creating different workspaces by toying with his computer’s camera.  
“This is me pulling out, like recording my text messages, my Instagram pages and posts, me texting friends or just like these screen-recordings,” Falagán said. “Though they’re kind of fake, it’s still real things I’m searching and interacting with. You get both my desktop and my visible self, and it’s this really weird intimate profile you get of me.” 
The most unique part about the work he creates is the social concepts that fuel his art, such as the idea of social media as a platform for forming new relationships. He uses his creations to ask questions about themes of connectedness, disillusion and reality as it relates to the digital sphere.
Falagán also explained that social media sparked his unique art form, as he originally directed his attention to Instagram for inspiration. 
“I found myself veering more and more toward social media [and] internet culture as a form of escapism because I’ve always been super interested in memes and why people gravitate towards certain types of content or how the internet works in linking together different ideas,” Falagán said. 
He started out by selecting specific memes and then deep-diving online to find as many versions of that meme as possible. He then took to his Instagram story, posting his findings one after another. Sometimes his findings would amount to 50 posts in a day.  
The reactions he received on his Instagram stories blew him away. He was intrigued by how many people commented or responded to him about the posts “instead of the mindless tapping [through]” that has become so prevalent within internet culture. 
According to Falagán, this led him to question why such consumers of media are so inclined to tap or swipe.  
Junior Natalie Lee, who has been roommates with Falagán since they met through gender neutral special interest housing their freshman year, said that she, as well as others who are close to Falagán, gets to experience his creations and evolution as an artist in a very “intimate way.”
Lee said Falagán enjoys exploring facets of art in the digital sphere — a medium that often goes ignored.
“Although I may not be eloquent enough to describe his work in ‘art-speak,’ I get to see Rudy toiling away at his art at home,” Lee said. “Whether it’s shredding pounds and pounds of paper, meticulously creating texture on intricate ceramic pieces, editing tons of gigabytes of Garfield, Minecraft and Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure footage and spending countless hours recreating real life people on Sims, Rudy laboriously dives into the subjects that he is so passionate in exploring.”
With an artistic perspective like Falagán’s, it would be easy to assume he has been developing his craft forever. But that’s not necessarily the case. 
Raised in Huntington Beach, Falagán comes from a mostly “numbers-oriented” family, he said. He wanted to be an engineer at one point before discovering his love for art in the second grade. According to Falagán, art provided support for his mental health rather than taking away from it.
“Mentally, I was like, ‘No, [math] is going to burn me out,’” Falagán said. “I guess that’s why I started going into art — because I was like, ‘Well, art makes me happy.’”  
However, Falagán said he is not so sure he can see himself pursuing his as a future career. With a minor in psychology, he has considered pursuing a job as a therapist to work with art in a different way as well. 
“I’m keeping it really open because there’s a lot of places I could go, and I don’t necessarily want to commit right now and put intense expectations on me,” Falagán said. “I’m just allowing things to happen.”

Recently, USC students received an email titled “Share Your Voice: Take the USC Values Poll.” Some students may think of the email as insignificant, scrolling past it or instantly deleting it. However, it is important to realize what the Values Poll means for the University when the trajectory of USC is significantly changing. 
The Values Poll symbolizes President Carol Folt’s determination to transform the University and turn the page on corruption. However, the Values Poll will remain just that: a poll that lacks  the backing of other initiatives and the support of faculty, staff and students. Although the poll’s launch marks a promising starting point, much more work needs to be done for the community to see lasting, sweeping change. 
The Values Poll is the first stage in a multi-step process aimed at reshaping the University’s culture. Specifically, the cultural commission members in charge of the initiative explained that the goal of the Values Poll is to “move toward understanding and assessing our current and desired values.” 
Once the poll closes, culture session town halls will take place for people to come together to talk extensively about advances they want to see. These discussions will then shape future actions — and hopefully culture changes — by the University. All of this is planned to take place in separate stages throughout the current academic year. 
The Values Poll asks four questions: Which 10 values/behaviors most reflect who you are? Which 10 values/behaviors most reflect your experience of your immediate environment (school or unit)? Which 10 values/behaviors most reflect your experience of USC as a whole? And which 10 values/behaviors do you believe are essential for USC to achieve its highest potential?
A list of key terms follows each question that includes, but is not limited to accomplishment, ethical, fairness and mindfulness. The student does not have the option to write in their own values but instead must select from the provided options. While suggestions may help lessen the time investment of participating, if the point of the poll is to gather the opinions of the students taking it, the poll should not limit the values deemed important by the University. 
Additionally, the questions are broad and vague, making it difficult for those taking the poll to give concise, accurate answers. Moreover, with the college admissions scandal still at the forefront of the cultural identity of USC, a question specifically addressing the application and admissions process is conspicuously absent, yet could have given meaningful insight into current campus culture.
While there are certain areas in which this poll could improve, the significance of the Values Poll should not be lost on anyone. The poll marks the first time the University has sent out a poll to staff, students and faculty, asking them to contribute opinions on changing major processes and culture at USC. 
Folt wants the core groups who make up the University to decide the direction in which it is headed. Instead of leaving reconstruction up to higher management or those with the biggest pockets, the Values Poll strives to give each and every person involved with this University a voice. 
But to be most effective, the collective voice should be arrived at with more than just static poll results. Instead of a mere tally of the opinions of faculty, staff and students, a more dynamic approach would be to bring these groups together to actively discuss about change. For example, Gould School of Law professor Ariela Gross argues that there should be faculty and student representation on the Board of Trustees because the school’s culture “will not be fixed with flowcharts or buzzwords like ‘wellness’ and ‘climate.’”
Although the Values Poll certainly creates an opportunity to help frame the discussion, until the representative student and faculty stakeholders are involved in the decision-making, the initiative is unlikely to be a driving force in transforming campus culture. The poll is too broad and too vague to stand alone as it is now. Hopefully, it will at least be a catalyst for wider, sweeping changes in structure, such as putting an end to the extreme commercialization of education and increasing tuition.  
With the simultaneous delivery of this email to all USC students  this past week, Folt showed that even though she is at the helm of the ship, she intends to be collaborative. So, even if there needs to be more stakeholders at the table, the Values Poll is an exciting hint of what is likely to come during Folt’s presidency and a strong indication that substantive changes are imminent. But while the poll is promising, there’s more to be done in changing the campus culture.

Too often is the media looking to scrutinize USC for not listening to students, for not taking care of scandals and for hiding information from students. While criticism is certainly valid and necessary, there are times when applauding the University is called for — and the implementation of fall break is one such time. 
Students found themselves all over the world last weekend. Some visited friends studying abroad, some spent time with family and others took time to relax in Los Angeles. Sure, maybe it wasn’t the smartest move to overlap break with homecoming weekend, but let’s look at the bright side. 
The Undergraduate Student Government pushed for the break by passing a resolution in Fall 2018, and although faculty previously disapproved of the proposal, USG collaborated with the Engemann Student Health Center to gather data showing a spike in student requests for counseling around the eighth week of the fall semester, the Daily Trojan reported last year.
Fall break is definitely a necessary recess. Prior to fall break, the months of September and October were the longest periods of full grind for students. Spring semester features a break almost every month, making it much more manageable compared to the fall. Without fall break, there would be nearly three full months of classes with no break from Labor Day in September until Thanksgiving at the end of November. 
The most notable aspect of fall break, however, is that it was brought about due to student demand — and USC complied with that demand. 
According to Daily Trojan archives, talks of fall break began in the academic senate beginning at least in 2009. The 2012 USG cabinet surveyed more than 900 students, finding that 90% of the student body supported the implementation of fall break. But because students rotate in and out of the University every year, the demand and advocacy died down eventually, and the break was never instituted. 
If there’s one lesson to learn from the pursuit of fall break, it’s that students need to come together and advocate with persistence. This lesson can be implemented with every current student demand, whether it involves dining, mental health, student housing or anything the administration has been reluctant to acknowledge is a problem. 
Nothing will get done unless students advocate for each other. That means Christian students must help Jewish and Muslim Trojans obtain food that meets their religious standards. It means men must advocate for women’s hygiene products. It means all students should listen to the concerns of underrepresented students.
While the University is owed a tip of the hat for listening to students, there is no denying that this could have happened earlier. And it more than likely would have happened earlier had the push been stronger. Yes, USG is a valuable resource for student advocacy, but it’s not enough to make change by itself. 
Change requires pressure from various fronts, from students who have no stake in the game besides helping their fellow Trojans. If we’re really a Trojan Family, then we ought to look out for each other in all capacities, not just when resolutions — like fall break — affects us all.

Former California food executive Michelle Janavs pleaded guilty Monday on charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering for her participation in Operation Varsity Blues.
Janavs, a Newport Beach resident, is accused of paying $300,000 to have her daughter admitted to USC as a beach volleyball recruit and of fixing her daughter’s ACT test scores. 
Janavs is one of three parents who chose to come forward on a guilty plea Monday after refusing a deal to plead guilty on a charge of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud in April. 
Janavs and the other 18 parents, including actress Lori Loughlin, who chose to maintain innocence were additionally charged with money laundering in April and now face pressure from federal prosecutors who warned that they could be charged with committing federal program bribery as soon as next week, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In August 2017,  Janavs forwarded correspondence to William “Rick” Singer, who ran the college admissions scheme, indicating that her daughter was approved for extended time on the ACT to which he replied, “Awesome news. It works.” In October 2017, Janavs’ daughter took the ACT at the West Hollywood Test Center, one of the main test centers involved in the admissions scandal. She received a score of 32 out of 36 on the entrance exam. 
To alter the entrance exam, Janavs paid two installments of $50,000 to the Key Worldwide Foundation, Singer’s fake charity, some of which was also distributed to the test proctor and Igor Dvorskiy, the director of the West Hollywood College Preparatory School.
Janav’s daughter submitted the falsified ACT test scores to USC in Fall 2018 as part of her application.
Unlike other students anonymously referenced in the investigation, Janavs’ daughter had played competitive volleyball in high school, but she hadn’t played beach volleyball competitively. The fake recruiting profile, presented by former associate athletic director Donna Heinel to an admissions committee, falsely stated she won several beach volleyball tournaments in California. 
Janavs’ daughter had received a conditional acceptance letter to USC in October 2018. During a January call with Janavs, Singer said a beach volleyball coach approached Heinel about Janavs’ daughter’s spot on the roster. If the coach approached Janavs about her daughter, Singer instructed her to say her daughter would be practicing at tournaments throughout the summer to prepare for the season, according to documents from the FBI investigation. 
Janavs also approached Singer in November 2018 to discuss paying for her younger daughter to take the ACT with Dvorskiy in Los Angeles. Janavs worried that her second daughter, who was studying in hopes of receiving a 34 or higher out of 36, might question why she had to travel to take the test.  
“The only thing is [my younger daughter] is not like [my older daughter] … She’s not stupid,” Janavs said in a phone call with Singer. “So if I said to her, ‘Well, we’re going to take it up at [Singer’s]’ she’s going to wonder why.” 
Her younger daughter took the exam with Dvorskiy in February 2019 at the West Hollywood Test Center and Janavs wired her first payment of $25,000 to a Boston account in the name of Singer’s Key Worldwide Foundation. 
Janavs will be sentenced Feb. 25. 
According to a press release from the District of Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s Office, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud can lead to a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the resulting gain or loss. Meanwhile, conspiracy to commit money laundering can result in a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved. 
So far, Agustin Huneeus, a prominent Napa Valley winemaker who paid $250,000 to have his daughter admitted to USC as a fake water polo recruit, has received the highest sentence of any parent to plead guilty for involvement in the scandal. Huneeus was sentenced to five months in prison, two years of supervised release and 500 hours of community service. He will also be required to pay a $100,000 fine. 
In response to a request for comment, USC directed the Daily Trojan to an informational page on its website last updated Aug. 12. 
“The University is conducting a full review of the matter and continues to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation,” the page read.
Janavs’ legal team did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.

A former Pimco CEO pleaded guilty Monday on charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering for his participation in Operation Varsity Blues. 
Douglas Hodge, a Laguna Beach resident, is accused of paying $525,000 to secure USC admission for his daughter and son as false soccer and football recruits. He began working with William “Rick” Singer, who ran the backdoor admissions scheme, in 2008 when Hodge allegedly began conspiring to gain his oldest daughter admittance to Georgetown University. He is also accused of attempting to secure admission to Loyola Marymount University for his youngest son in 2018.
In a prepared statement distributed by his legal team, Hodge wrote he takes “full and complete responsibility” for his actions.
“I have always prided myself on leading by example, and I am ashamed of the decisions I made,” he wrote. “I acted out of love for my children, but I know that this explanation for my actions is not an excuse. I also want to apologize to the deserving college students who may have been adversely impacted by this process.” 
Hodge is the first of 19 parents to come forward on a guilty plea after refusing a deal to plead to a single fraud conspiracy charge. Three additional parents are also expected to plead guilty Monday. The group of 19, which includes actress Lori Loughlin and her husband fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, was also charged with money laundering in April. According to the Los Angeles Times, their decisions to plead guilty follow increased pressure from federal prosecutors who warned that those maintaining innocence could be charged with committing federal program bribery as early as next week.
Hodge will be sentenced Jan. 22 by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton. According to a press release from the District of Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s Office, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud can lead to a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the resulting gain or loss. Meanwhile, conspiracy to commit money laundering can result in a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved. 
To secure his daughter’s admission as a false soccer recruit, Hodge paid three installments of $50,000 to a private soccer club run by former USC women’s soccer head coach Ali Khosrohahin and former assistant coach Laura Janke in 2012 and 2013. He also paid an additional $150,000 to The Key and $50,000 to the Key Worldwide Foundation, both owned by Singer. According to the FBI investigation, his daughter’s application to USC claimed that she was co-captain of a Japanese national soccer team and an “All American” midfielder on a prestigious U.S. club team. Hodge’s daughter received admission to the University in March 2013.
Hodge’s son was accepted to USC in 2015. According to FBI investigation documents, Hodge inquired in December 2014 whether his son was “‘really qualified’ for USC, noting ‘He would go there in a heartbeat!!’” According to documents, Hodge received two falsified athletic recruitment profiles from Janke for football and tennis, which included fabricated accolades such as “Team Captain — Senior Year” and “NH Independent Schools All-American Selection 2013, 2014.” 
Hodge sent a $75,000 check to former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who was fired for her involvement in the college admissions scheme in March, for the USC “Women’s Athletic Board” and paid $125,000 to The Key and $125,000 to the Key WorldWide Foundation, some of which was transferred to Janke for the “SC Futbol Academy,” a private soccer team.
Records indicate his son did not play football in high school past freshman year. Though he did play tennis in high school, there was no record of his involvement in the First Team Lake Region League as indicated on the falsified profile.
“Doug I have provided t[w]o profiles from Laura,” Singer wrote in an email to Hodge. “Please download and send to Donna [Heinel] and ask her to use whichever she likes. Obviously we have stretched the truth but this is what is done for all kids. Admissions just needs something to work with to show he is an athlete. They do not follow up after Donna presents. Please confirm receipt and when you send to Donna.”
In response to a request for comment, USC directed the Daily Trojan to an informational page on its website last updated Aug. 12. 
“The University is conducting a full review of the matter and continues to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation,” the page read.
