The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly hosted the Institute’s fourth and final installment in the “It’s Our Election Too” series Wednesday. Moderators included Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur and APASA External Community Chair Amy Chau. Panelists included L.A. Councilmember David Ryu, Voting Coordinator at the L.A. branch of  Asian Americans Advancing Justice Shelly Chen, and, Sarah Kim, APASA Finance Director, and Aliza Khan, a junior majoring in economics.
Ryu was the first Korean American and only the second Asian American to be elected to municipal office in Los Angeles. Representing the Fourth District, stretching from Sherman Oaks to Koreatown, Ryu was elected with strong support from the Korean community in and around his district. He discussed his campaign with the panel and the similarities to the national election.
“If you look at my [City Council] election, it’s just a microcosm of what’s going to happen in the macro,” Ryu said.
While Ryu ran in a crowded non-partisan primary for City Council with 13 opponents, he  and defeated front-runner Carolyn Ramsay, former chief-of-staff to then-incumbent Councilmember Tom LaBonge in the general election.
The panel also touched on the importance of Asian Americans actually turning out to participate in the elections that elect their representatives.
Kim noted that Asian Americans may be skeptical of participating in American politics because of their associations with politics back home or may simply have little motivation to do so.
“A lot of older generations feel that — even though they have become citizens in recent years — they feel more plugged in back at home, whether that be China, or Korea or Vietnam, and they don’t believe that they should participate here [in U.S. elections],” Kim said.
Chen spoke on her work with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, dealing with challenges of getting Asian voters to turn out and participate on Election Day. AAAJ is an advocacy organization that works on behalf of Asian Americans to organize on issues such as race relations and domestic violence.
“Our [Asian] communities are disproportionately immigrant and relatively limited-English-speaking, and so what that means is that many folks face barriers when it comes to the voting process,” Chen said. “Particularly when it comes to language, many voters don’t know the resources that are available to them.”
When questioned about the possible influence the Asian-American community could have on future elections through its traditional view as a swing voter block, both Chen and Kim pointed out that many Asian Americans vote regarding issue positions and less by party.
In her response, Kim noted that in past presidential elections, Asian Americans cast as many as 74 percent of their votes for Democrats. However, twenty years into the past, just as high a percentage voted for Republican candidates.
Chen, however, noted that Asian Americans are often ignored because they aren’t widely considered to be reliable partisan voters.
“A lot of folks in our [Asian Pacific American] community are unaffiliated,” Chen pointed out. “What happens, sometimes to our detriment, is that our community is ignored by those mainstream candidates.”
Finally, Ryu addressed the students by discussing how he used “people power” to overcome the odds against him in his election for City Council.
“They said ‘it’s not our turn [to have a Korean councilman],’” Ryu said. “See, in politics, power is not given. It’s taken.”

Trojans for Israel hosted a panel with USC Undergraduate Student Government leaders and political experts to discuss the United States’ foreign policy in the Middle East in relation to Israel during a leadership dinner at USC Hillel Wednesday.
The panelists included Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Yaki Lopez, consul for political affairs at the Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles, Alec White, a member of the College Democrats, and Aaron Rifkind, a member of the College Republicans.
Audience members asked panelists about an array of subjects, including the relationship between the U.S. and Israeli governments, the handling of the refugee crisis in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President of TFI and moderator Samantha Viterbi said that she was pleased that the oftentimes-contrasting political opinions and agendas of the panelists offered a multitude of beliefs and possible solutions.
“I enjoyed that we brought four people to the panel tonight because I thought that there were a lot of different perspectives shown,” Viterbi said. “I was excited to hear the different thoughts from the College Democrats and College Republicans.”
Schnur and Lopez believed that the United States has played a dramatic role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East since the end of the World War II. They stressed that the U.S. must continue to offer financial and military support in order to help stabilize this largely volatile region in the world.
The night was filled with many attempts at finding solutions for Israel’s international political affairs. Lopez hinted that, with the new agreement with the United States, which allows Iran greater nuclear capacities, there has been a greater dialogue between Israel and the Sunni countries in the region. He believes that a coalition between Middle Eastern states will inspire a greater effort in their combined fight against ISIL, and can additionally contribute to stabilizing the relationship between Israel and Palestine.
Lopez said the United States should set a precedent to the rest of the world that they are willing to support countries that share its beliefs in human rights, and that the government of Israel would similarly support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if the Palestinian government demonstrates that it is willing to comply with such human rights conditions.
“Israel supports a two-state solution. We would like to see a viable Palestinian state,” Lopez said. “The only way we are going to achieve that is by talking face-to-face.”
Schnur gave an example of his own Jewish grandparents, who faced xenophobic sentiment when they emigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe to escape persecution by Nazi Germany, as a reminder to the audience of the humanitarian responsibility the United States has to rest of the world.
Schnur disagreed with the idea that Syrian refugees could bring terrorism. Schnur said that while his grandparents were labeled as spies for Germany, without the support of the U.S. government, neither he nor many Jewish families would be there tonight. As a result, Schnur said that the United States should “set the tone,” and be far more active in the resettlement process of Syrian refugees.
“A lesson to learn in the Syrian refugee crisis is to set an example for the rest of the world,” Schnur said. “We will lack the moral stature to go to other countries and ask them to bear their share of the burden if we are not in the front lines helping too.”

The Mathematics Graduate Students Association at USC held their second annual Math Festival in Hahn Plaza on Wednesday, where different branches of mathematics were explained to students.
Can Oguz, a Ph.D. student in mathematics at USC, was the president of MGSA last year. He came up with the idea of the math festival and manned the algebra table.
“I really like the idea of having this math festival. I am a TA and I get more questions like, ‘What else is there in math?’” Oguz said. “The courses in math are limited and I think this festival was our only way to communicate what else is there beside the regular curriculum in mathematics.”
Six tables represented each area of mathematics that were highlighted: topology, geometry, combinatorics, algebra, probability and analysis. Students had the chance to win prizes depending on the number of stars they won for math games, like forming shapes out of pentominoes and dividing a shape into a number of other equal shapes on the combinatorics table. Each table had graduate students explain different math concepts.
Ezgi Kantarci, the president of MGSA and a graduate student in mathematics said that the highlight of the festival were the games.
“Organizing this festival was hectic, but it is also fun,” Kantarci said. “I get to play games with people all day, and plus we get a lot of positive reactions about math. So that is the best part.”
The topology table depicted the area of mathematics that studies different types of knots, links and braids. It was explained by the secretary of MGSA, Ilknur Egilmez.
“It is interesting to know that people actually study knot theory and it is something that is never shown in a class,” Egilmez said. “Mathematics is not only about integrals or something that you need to struggle with. So this festival will really change their [student’s] perspective towards math.”
On the geometry table, students dipped different symmetrical geometric shapes formed out of wire into soap water to see how the film formed by the wire took on different shapes. Professor Francis Bonahon of the mathematics department explained the phenomenon of minimal surfaces formed by these soap films around symmetric shapes.
Students had to solve analytical problems in order to earn a star at the analysis table. The probability table had a game of dice to teach students about probability.
The graduate students of the math department organized this festival with the help of the Academic Culture Assembly. Two graduate students of the computer science department, Eric Heiden and Bhaskar Bandyopadhyay reflected on the festival.
“I got to learn many new things about harmonographs, probabilities, complex algebra as well as combinatorics,” Bandyopadhyay said. “So it was very good.”
Heiden also recapped the positive aspects of the festival.
“It is a great event, and I think the math department got us some new things to see on campus, so it was really interesting,” Heiden said.

For years, students have come to the Roski School of Art and Design’s Masters of Fine Arts program to grow as artists in an environment that allows them to collaborate with their peers and learn from their professors.
However, in May 2015, Roski’s MFA class of 2016 collectively dropped out to protest administrative issues that they saw as pervasive and restrictive. Since then, the current MFA class has shrunk substantially, enrolling only one student, HaeAhn Kwon, compared to last year’s seven — and according to Kwon, few changes have come about as the result of the students’ collective action.
The seven students who made up the 2016 MFA class dropped out because they believed funding and curriculum changes were made with no consultation or transparency. In a statement published online, students said that because the school “refused to honor its promises to us, we are returning to the workforce degree-less and debt-full.”
“[Roski] reneg[ed] on funding and curricular promises made to us, [and] as a protest against the normalization of massive student debt, and to act on our desire to put our energies towards structures that encourage participation, agency, more weirdness and more joy,” former MFA student Lee Relvas released in a statement separate from the statement made by the entire MFA class.
The administration had no comment on whether changes have been made in response to criticism from the 2016 MFA class and alumni. For Kwon, however, being the only student has been “emotionally exhausting,” particularly in the “contentious context of this diminished [MFA] program.” Kwon, who focuses on drawing, installation and sculpture for her degree, has similar complaints to the seven former MFA students, and has also made efforts to reach out to Roski leadership, yet she has experienced no changes in curriculum.
“I’ve tried my best to indicate concerns and express the urgent need for changes to how [the] lack of structure is affecting my education, even meeting with the Provost,” Kwon said. “I’m sure any improvements to the program will take a long time, much longer than I will ever be able to witness.”
The lack of colleagues or fellow MFA students has been a major drawback for Kwon, who was told that all seven members of the previous MFA class were dropping out two weeks after she accepted the International Artist Fellowship, a fellowship reserved for international students. By the time she heard that the previous class had dropped out, she had already made arrangements to leave her home in Seoul, South Korea. Kwon said that after hearing about the changes that the students were protesting, the only thing keeping her at Roski was the free tuition, housing and a stipend that her fellowship offered.
“I spent most of the first term feeling horrible about what had happened here and how my involvement might appear to make me complicit with the perilous turns this program has taken,” Kwon said. “It has been emotionally exhausting to attempt to work here as the only MFA student.  There is no camaraderie, which is obviously a huge disadvantage.”
Much of the class of 2016’s criticism was directed toward Roski’s leadership, and in particular newly-appointed Dean Erica Muhl, whom they felt lacked “background or expertise in the visual arts field whatsoever,” according to Relvas’ online statement. The class believed the leadership was overly detached and unaccountable, attempting to empirically measure, assign value and monetize everything for maximum profit.
Kwon agreed with the criticisms of the previous MFA class, and spoke about the challenges she will face once she graduates from Roski.
“In speaking to various members of the community in L.A., it was revealed to me that nobody who wants to participate in L.A.’s art community would ever want to attend this school, given its current negative associations,” Kwon said. “Many artists in L.A. have explained to me that being associated with USC is actually damaging in terms of future prospects for an emerging American artist.”
Muhl herself admitted this in an interview with the Los Angeles Times following the students’ collective dropout in 2015, when she said that “the negative publicity may have affected recruitment efforts.”
Many of the changes that the MFA students were protesting involved administrative changes, as several faculty members left Roski in recent years. In December of 2014, Frances Stark, a prominent Los Angeles artist and tenured professor, abruptly left the school after a decade of teaching. Around the same time, photographer and installation artist A.L. Steiner stepped down as the director of the MFA program. In February 2015, graduate coordinator Dwayne Moser, who had been at the school for six years, also left Roski.
Stark, who was reached via email by the Los Angeles Times, did not comment on why she left, but instead emailed a statement of support for the MFA students, affirming their criticisms in terms of “funding, curriculum and faculty structure, [which] all changed in relation to the program they agreed to enter.”
The absence of such prominent faculty members is felt at Roski for Kwon.
“There are still some strong artists and pedagogues among the remaining faculty, but I have to admit that the whole department feels completely fractured,” Kwon said. “Nobody is happy, [and] there seems to be tremendous unrest and uncertainty coupled with resentment and sadness.”
In response to these past criticisms, Roski Communications Coordinator Ellen Evaristo referenced Muhl’s statement regarding the dropout, in which Muhl expressed regret over the departure of the students yet defended the changes made to the MFA curriculum. Other members of the Roski school declined to comment.
While Kwon’s time at Roski is half over, she offered up some advice to future classes.
“The rumor circulating about next year is that a group of students are coming and I sympathize with them, because they probably think it’ll just be great to get to LA — just as I did — but they should brace themselves to feel very isolated from the community here,” Kwon said. “USC carries a very negative stigma in the broader context of Los Angeles, or perhaps in the whole of the American art world.”
USC cares only about money and institutional prestige. It barely cares about students, about education, about higher thought, and cares not at all about art. The policy is so short-sided, and USC’s prestige will decay as quickly as that faux Gothic facade on the new Annenberg building.

The outcome at Ruby Hills wasn’t decided until the final few holes, but it’s now official: The USC women’s golf team is this year’s Pac-12 conference champion.
“I’m just very proud that our players all contributed to our victory this week,” head coach Andrea Gaston said. “The team has been diligently practicing and preparing for our postseason, so it was nice to see all their hard work pay off.”
Bolstered by a dominant start, the No. 2 Trojans finished with a final team score of -18, 3 strokes better than second-place finisher UCLA. Ahead by 7 strokes, the Trojans knew they were close to victory as the Bruins had already wrapped up for the day. USC’s work, however, wasn’t quite finished as they still had a few holes to go.
To bring home the championship, the Trojans had to finish strong despite their team’s weakest round of the week. Though the final few holes proved challenging, USC relied on experience to stay cool under pressure and eventually clung to the lead even as the gap tightened between the crosstown rivals with each stroke.
The Trojans were among the favorites coming into the conference championship, but they knew their road to the Pac-12 title would not be an easy one. In order to claim their fourth Pac-12 crown in the last nine seasons, the Trojans had to outplay some of the toughest competition, not just on the West Coast, but in the entire country. All of the Trojans’ opponents began the match ranked in the country’s top 25 teams, as the field was comprised of No. 1 UCLA, No. 6 Stanford, No. 10 Arizona State, No. 12 Arizona, No. 13 Washington, No. 15 Cal, No. 21 Oregon and No. 25 Colorado.
“We have one of the strongest conferences in the country, and a lot of great players who can shoot low scores,” Gaston said. “When we come together at this championship, you never know which team will step up.”
Over the three-day competition at Ruby Hills in Pleasanton, California, the Trojans proved to be up for the challenge. Each of USC’s golfers finished at or under par, and all of them finished in the top 20 individual finishers at the match. Junior Gabriella Then led the Trojans with a final score of -8, good for 3rd overall in the competition. Fellow juniors Karen Chung and Tiffany Chan each finished at -3, tying them for 10th place at the end of the match. Robyn Ree, USC’s only freshman competing, finished -1, tied for 12th, while senior Kyung Kim broke even, finishing tied for 18th.
Led by Chan’s first-round score of 67, the Trojans opened the championships with a 4-stroke lead over UCLA after day one. The Trojans’ first-round team score of -10 was the best-ever single-round team performance for USC in Pac-12 Championship history, breaking the previous record of -8 set by the 2013 squad, which also went on to win the conference title.
Not to be outdone, Then posted a career-best round score of 65 with eight birdies in the second round, where the Trojans broke their single-round record for the second consecutive day. USC finished at -13 for the second round, giving them a 13-stroke stroke lead over UCLA and Arizona going into the final day.
On day three, Then, Chung and Kim all shot one-over par to lead the team to their fifth overall win this season and their first Pac-12 title since 2013. The title is USC’s sixth conference title in program history.
The women’s golf team now turns their attention ahead to the NCAA Regional Championships, which begins on May 5. The NCAA Championships will take place at the end of May in Eugene, Oregon.

No. 19 women’s tennis could not hold on a 2-0 lead against No. 13 Stanford in the Pac-12 title match on Wednesday afternoon at the Ojai Valley Athletic Club, falling to the Cardinal 4-2 and losing for the first time in nine matches.
USC (12-5, 7-1) won the doubles point to kick off play with a strong 6-1 victory by freshmen Jessica Failla and Rianna Valdes over Stanford’s 67th-ranked Krista Hardebeck and Caroline Lampl followed by a 6-3 win by the No. 7 duo of senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomore Gabby Smith over Stanford’s No. 5-ranked Taylor Davidson and Caroline Doyle.
The Trojans jumped ahead by 2 points after junior Zoë Katz beat No. 82 Doyle to begin singles action. But Stanford (14-5, 9-1) stormed back to claim its first conference title since 2012 and 25th overall. No. 24 Olmos fell to Carol Zhao and No. 116 Madison Westby lost to No. 40 Taylor Davidson, both in two sets to even the score 2-2.
On Court 4, Rianna Valdes forced a tiebreaker in the second set against Melissa Lord, but ultimately lost 7-5, 7-6 (1), giving Stanford a 3-2 advantage. Caroline Lampl clinched for the Cardinal, defeating freshman Jessica  Failia in comeback fashion — 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 — for a 4-2 victory.
The date of the Women of Troy’s next team competition will be decided on May 3 when the NCAA Team Championship bracket is announced. Action in Ojai will continue Thursday as the singles and doubles competitions in the Pac-12 Championships take place through Sunday.

The baseball team makes its second trek in two weeks to the Pacific Northwest on Friday, as they take on Washington State in a three-game set in Pullman. USC is currently 16-19 overall on the season, but its record in Pac-12 play sits at 5-7 after the team was swept by Oregon last weekend.
The Trojans crushed 5 home runs, snapping a four-game skid with an 8-3 victory over Long Beach State on Tuesday. Sophomore Adalberto Carrillo hit his sixth and seventh dingers of the season in a 2-homer effort, junior Corey Dempster and senior David Oppenheim went back-to-back in the third, and junior Jeremy Martinez blasted a pitch over the wall in a straightaway center in the fifth. The 5 home runs were the most USC has hit in one game since 1997.
Sophomore Mitch Hart made his fourth start of the season on the mound for the Trojans, and the righty logged a perfect inning before being lifted for freshman CJ Stubbs. Stubbs, freshman Marrick Crouse, senior Marc Huberman and junior Jeff Paschke combined to hold Long Beach State to 3 runs and seven hits over the remaining eight innings and seal a much-needed win.
USC entered the year with high expectations following a strong regular season in 2015 and after putting up a tough fight in the postseason against eventual national champions Virginia. The 2016 season may not be going quite so swimmingly, but despite the disappointing current overall record, the Trojans know: Make the NCAA Tournament, and anything could happen from there.
“Once we get in [to the tournament], we don’t think there’s going to be anyone who can stop us,” Carrillo said. “We just have to find a way to get in and just keep on winning.”
Head coach Dan Hubbs agreed with his third baseman, pointing out that Virginia squeaked into tournament last year before going on to win the College World Series.
“Two weeks before the regionals, it didn’t look like [Virginia was] going to get in … and they won the whole thing,” Hubbs said. “This team has that kind of talent. It’s just a matter of putting it together, getting healthy, and playing well enough at the right time.”
USC is eighth in the Pac-12, three games behind leaders Utah, who the Trojans took two of three against two weekends ago. The team looks to get its season back on track with a good showing against the cellar-dweller Cougars, who lie at the bottom of the conference standings. Washington State won its first Pac-12 series of the season last weekend in an impressive set against No. 14 Oregon State, and the Cougars will shoot for two in a row against USC.
As he has preached throughout the season, Hubbs said as long as his players believe in their ability and don’t press at the plate, on the mound, or in the field, they will get results.
“We just have to continue to stay within ourselves,” he said. “Offensively, we can score off of anyone … and on the pitching side, it’s just been inconsistency. If we shore that up, then I think we’ll be fine.”
First pitch at Bailey-Brayton Field is slated for 5 p.m. on Friday. After their long road trip to Pullman, the Trojans will enjoy a long stay in Los Angeles, as they begin a seven-game home stand next Tuesday against UC Irvine. USC then welcomes Arizona and Washington to Dedeaux Field on back-to-back weekends before taking on UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium in a three-game series the following week.

Keep it rolling · Pat Haden helped USC recover from crippling sanctions. Now, it is up to Lynn Swann (above) to take the next step forward. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
USC Athletics reminds me of a heavy-duty locomotive. Something can attempt to stop it with all of its might, but 99 times out of 100, that locomotive is going to continue to steamroll in its desired direction with little to no damage done to it.
Almost six years ago, the NCAA tried to become that 1 percent when it handed down sanctions that it hoped to derail the USC Athletics program in the years to come. “A lack of institutional control” apparently warranted that.
The football program faced a two-year postseason ban and was docked 10 scholarships for each of the following three seasons, while men’s hoops also self-imposed a postseason ban in 2010 and gave up a scholarship for two straight seasons. All hope seemed lost, especially for the football and men’s basketball programs which are traditionally the “bread and butter” of any collegiate athletics program.
A natural conductor, Pat Haden stepped in as athletic director that summer and somehow managed to keep USC’s locomotive on track, despite the cloud of turmoil that was present when he took over. Under Haden’s tenure, graduation rates for student-athletes went up, athletics fundraising was as high as it’s ever been, and a number of new facilities were built.
Of course, the NCAA did undoubtedly still do its damage with the blunder that it delivered. USC football was crippled by scholarship limitations, which led to lackluster on-field performances year after year and even more off-the-field drama with firings on airport tarmacs, unexpected hires and some personal problems that would lead to yet another coaching change. All of that is now in the past.
Haden maneuvered around just about every obstacle thrown at him — some with more noise than others — but he deserves to be commended for leaving the athletics program in a better place than it was when he took over.
The direction of both the football and basketball programs are perfect indicators of that upward trend, a progression that must be continued by the new sheriff in town: former USC football player and NFL Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann.
While there are doubters of Swann out there who say that his lack of athletic administrative experience makes him the wrong man for the job, I respectfully disagree.
A one-time candidate gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania, Swann is a natural politician, who will likely flourish as the figurehead of an athletic department that is as iconic as USC’s.  Just as he is responsible for the well-being of USC’s student-athletes, he is the man who will also serve as the ambassador of one of the country’s most renowned athletics programs.
He must pick up where Haden left off, though, come July 1. Over the past five and a half years, the department has operated on a mantra of “continuous improvement” in all facets. That includes student-athlete performance and well-being, compliance, facilities, academics, and attendance at sporting events, among many other things.
The athletic director position has evolved greatly over the past half decade, particularly due to the emergence of the invisible “arms race” among college programs, which requires a great deal of assets, resources and manpower on a daily basis. Swann will be tasked with making certain that all of the parts of the high-powered and intricate locomotive are functioning. It’s something I think Haden did well with his leadership, especially when some of the moving parts needed repairs, such as athletic compliance.
There’s still a lot to build on as Swann learns the job on the fly. There really is no job or experience that could possibly prepare someone to be the athletic director at USC, not even athletic administrative experience.
Swann’s first and foremost duty, however, will be to ensure the comfort and prosperity of his student-athletes, on and off the playing field.
“This is not about me, this is about the kids,” Swann said in regard to his student-athletes in his introductory press conference.
If he can live up to his promises, the athletics program should be in store for a pleasant ride in the years to come.

Swann is another figure head. He should have been brought in a year ago to learn the ropes first. It would be interesting to know who were the top three finalist besides Lopes for the position. USC is always so secretive in their hiring process especially in athletics. They have been turned down more often than not guess that is why.

The No. 8 USC men’s tennis team will play in the Pac-12 championships over the weekend looking to defend its title.
The Trojans will aim to repeat last year’s success and secure a berth in the NCAA Championships that will take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the end of May. Since the format was changed in 2012, the Trojans have been crowned conference champions twice, taking the first title and winning it all last year.
The Trojans finished the regular season with a 4-2 home loss to No. 4 UCLA. Overall they went 15-5 in the season, with a 5-2 conference record. They were awarded the second seed in the draw, earning them a spot in the semifinals.
They will face the winner of the match between No. 3 Cal and either No. 6 Washington or No. 7 Utah. The action began on Wednesday but the Trojans are not scheduled to play until Friday.
With a win, the Trojans are likely to face No. 1 UCLA for the conference title on Saturday.
The Trojans are led by Max de Vroome, the lone senior in the team. De Vroome is currently ranked at No. 23 and is on an eight-match winning streak at first singles. Junior Nick Crystal sits at No. 43 and has a 8-2 record at second singles. Freshman Logan Smith is ranked at No. 55 in the country and fellow freshman Jake DeVine is ranked at No. 106 and on a three-match win streak. Sophomore Thibault Forget is ranked at No. 120 and is tied with de Vroome for the team lead in wins with 28.
In doubles, USC’s top pair consists of Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven, currently ranked at No. 42 in the nation. They lead the team with 11 wins in doubles. The second doubles pair is composed of de Vroome and freshman Jack Jaede. They are 6-4 in the second spot and have achieved nine wins together in the season.
The match will start at 1 p.m. on Friday at Libbey Park.

Civilization is what separates the barbarians from the normal folk — or so it goes. High-Rise is a visually striking sci-fi thriller that seeks to challenge that notion, and while the plot is a little hard to follow at times, it ultimately unravels a primal narrative through its gorgeous cinematography.
High-Rise, based off of the 1975 novel of the same name by J. G. Ballard, starts with Dr. Robert Laing, played by Tom Hiddleston, moving into a large apartment building that has more than just living spaces. With a supermarket and swimming pool, the building seems to be the perfect place to live on paper, but it’s not at all a utopia. The architect of the building, Anthony Royal, played by Jeremy Irons, lives at the top like a god, and Laing learns of the unofficial class structure that divides all of the residents. Eventually, the building loses all of its power, and with tensions among the residents reaching a boiling point, all sense of humanity is thrown out of the window, and everyone reverts to their most primal instincts.
The plot unfolds slowly, and at times, it’s a little tricky to tell what exactly is happening. Most of the movie brings up questions for the viewer that they assume will be answered in due time. While there is a resolution, the audience might not be satisfied with the answer they get. It’s slightly frustrating, since some of the characters make certain choices that aren’t really clear without having a firm grasp on what’s going on. It’s not too much of a problem, since the basic plot is really simple to follow: People go from acting civilized to acting like cave-people once the electricity turns off. Subtle character nuances and subplots are more difficult to understand as the film progresses, which can be annoying at times, especially with the recurring ones.
Hiddleston gives a very reserved performance as a character that rarely shows emotion until the end of the film. He plays the part well, and it’s a good to see that he can deliver performances that aren’t Shakespearian, something he’s known for with his portrayals of Loki. Despite strong performances from Sienna Miller and Luke Evans, the best scenes are the ones with Hiddleston in them. His character is hard to pin down and stays shrouded in a morally gray cloak. This is both a highlight of and hindrance to the film, as it doesn’t help with the film’s muddy plot, and Laing’s choices in the film can be just as confusing, On the other hand, Laing keeps the film interesting by keeping the audience on their toes with its unpredictability.
The film’s greatest strength is the cinematography. This film is so beautifully shot, it almost excuses the confusing plot, and it serves as a nice distraction from trying to put two and two together in terms of what’s happening in the story. In fact, while the written narrative can be hard to follow, the visual narrative is imperative in making sense out of everything. It’s just as helpful as it is gorgeous, and without it, the story would be almost impossible to understand. Scenes where Hiddleston’s figure seemingly repeats itself in an elevator that has mirrors on all four walls combined with dramatic lighting that casts a strong shadow over his face is just one shot out of many others that not only look fantastic but help the audience delve deeper into the narrative.
High-Rise is a strange film and graphic if nothing else. There is almost nothing left to the imagination when it comes to the inhabitants of the apartment complex slowly reverting to barbaric behavior. The choice to model the fashion style after the ’70s is an interesting one that ultimately works, since the ’70s was one of the most socially liberal times in history. It adds to the narrative, which can sometimes be hazy, and it certainly adds to the beautiful cinematography that is both helpful in making sense of the plot and the film’s strongest aspect. It’s not a sci-fi that will join the ranks of Star Wars, Blade Runner or any other legendary classics, but it is worth seeing.

As a 15-year-old, I was obsessed with Laurie Halse Anderson’s Wintergirls. Lia, the main character, was a skinny girl suffering from anorexia nervosa. She counted calories and measured her food, which she almost always threw away after a couple of bites. Her bones were visible beneath her skin. She did not let food control her. Wherever she went, people whispered about how thin she was. To me, she was perfect.
At the time, I read countless books featuring girls with eating disorders. They were all cautionary tales. The authors did not glamourize eating disorders. They described the individuals with bulimia or anorexia as gaunt, emaciated, wasted. But for me, and countless others with eating disorders, those books were how-to guides for getting thinner — and sicker.
When Naomi Wolf’s The Beauty Myth was published in 1990, it was an immediate bestseller. It was both acclaimed and criticized by experts and casual readers alike. Undoubtedly, it changed lives with its critical analysis of the detrimental effects of American culture’s fascination with the perfect body.
For Wolf, the beauty myth is the lie that the public — especially girls and women — has been force-fed, pun intended. The lie is the unrealistic set of standards of physical beauty that has been cemented as the “ideal” body every female should work to attain.
The Beauty Myth was republished in 2002 with a new introduction, where Wolf noted that 11 years later, much has changed for the better, but also for the worse.
“Most satisfyingly, today you would be hard-pressed to find a 12-year-old girl who is not all too familiar with the idea that ‘ideals’ are too tough on girls, that they are unnatural, and that following them too slavishly is neither healthy nor cool,” Wolf wrote in the 2002 introduction.
On the other hand, just as women and girls challenged the norm, the norm changed.
“In spite of this newly developed media literacy, however, I’ve also noticed that it is now an increasingly sexualized ideal that younger and younger girls are beginning to feel they must live up to,” Wolf wrote.
With the prevalence of pornography, body image issues have grown more complex.
According to Wolf, pornography’s effect on women’s sense of self-worth is so pervasive because “it is almost impossible for younger women to distinguish the role pornography plays in creating their idea of how to be, look and move … from their own innate sense of sexual identity.”
Many adult film actresses have silicone breast implants and tiny waists. This unnatural image has moved from such films to the rest of society, where GUESS Jeans and Calvin Klein ads now feature women with the same altered body type.
Since then, eating disorders have been written about many times. They have been analyzed and dissected to their root causes, the primary one being the popular image of the perfect body in the media, which is generally that of a skinny white woman. Positive body image enterprises, such as the USC Women’s Student Assembly’s Body Love Initiative and shows like Orange is the New Black, which features women of all races and body sizes, have popped up everywhere over the past few years.
But despite that, there are approximately 30 million people suffering from eating disorders in the U.S. alone, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. A survey at one U.S. college campus found that 91 percent of females dieted to lose weight, and 22 percent dieted on a regular basis.
Despite the widespread education about the issues of obsessive dieting and eating disorders, Wolf notes that such disorders are now so widespread themselves that they have become the standard.
“Not only do whole sororities take for granted that bulimia is mainstream behavior, but models now openly talk to Glamour magazine about their starvation regimes,” Wolf writes. “A newspaper feature about a group of thin, ambitious young women talking about weight, quotes one of them as saying, ‘Now what’s wrong with throwing up?’ And ‘pro-ana’ websites have appeared on the internet, indicating a sub-culture of girls who are ‘pro-anorexia,’ who find the anorexic look appealing and validate it. That is definitely not progress.”
The normalization of eating disorders means that they’re now somewhat acceptable. And like Wolf said, that is most definitely not progress.
As I was writing this, I caught myself humming the tune to Lily Allen’s “The Fear,” which used to be a song on my “weight loss motivation” playlist because it had one particular lyric: “Now everything’s cool as long as I’m getting thinner.” I’m still susceptible to the pitfalls of body image, but so is anyone who has ever hated their body.
Short of changing the way popular culture portrays women, little else will change the distorted beauty ideals society cherishes so much. But every step counts, whether it’s a campus-wide rehabilitation of body image, a diverse TV show that reaches millions, or even the small-scale but life-changing move of learning to love yourself — scars, fat, cellulite and all.

Though street vending is illegal under city law, few authorities actually enforce the ban and allow vendors to operate without fear of harassment. However, a council decision last year reinstated the long-dormant ban on vendor operations in city parks, and critics have begun to voice complaints at increased congestion in public walkways and potential competition between vendors and actual businesses around them.
In a sense, they’re not wrong. Vendors themselves have reported a marked increase in street vending over the past years. Most are attempting to make enough money to make ends meet in the face of rising living costs and stagnating wages in the city. Some report the presence of native-born American vendors in addition to the existing primarily immigrant sellers. The rise in street vending for Los Angeles is indicative of a need for expanded economic opportunity in the city. Critics who undermine immigrant businesses are putting the beautification of their neighborhoods over the livelihoods of poor families.
For thousands of families, street vending is an economic necessity, not a side job for already employed Americans. Some vendors report that they earn only $40 a day —and it is their family’s sole source of income. Others squeeze what little they can out of selling apparel in order to make rent prices. Unlike those maintaining food trucks, which require more capital and permits, those running street-side businesses routinely face risk of fines and are unable to obtain permits under L.A. city law. For a city known for gourmet food trucks, the lack of support structures or a permit system for vendors is a contradiction which suppresses immigrant families for whom this revenue is a necessity.
Opponents advocating for a crackdown on sidewalk businesses contend that vendors themselves not only hurt small businesses but also congest sidewalks, hurting economic activity. But these arguments discount the presence of the vendors themselves as immigrant-owned businesses that provide sources for economic empowerment; their profits alone contribute almost half a billion dollars to the city economy almost every year. Congestion is a small price to pay for a major source of economic activity helping poor, primarily immigrant families survive.
The rhetoric of city “beautification” in the face of street vendors is not a unique one; even today, vendors constantly live in fear of police officers fining them or even confiscating their stands. A similar message resides in recent actions by cops who routinely drove the homeless population out of their homes, confiscated relief supplies and donated houses and beat residents. The efforts of “beautifiers,” however, don’t actually deter the market — they only make the environment of those selling food or goods more dangerous. City officials have more pressing matters than driving vendors out in order to make room for wider streets with more spacious sidewalks. The innovation of small, family-owned sidewalk businesses is repeatedly erased as they are prevented from obtaining some of the only jobs they can.
A permit system may be an effective solution to send a more compassionate message toward the city’s vendors. An expanded food inspection system along with actual permits for vendors may help businesses ensure checks on quality. For a business with such large economic activity, a wholesale ban on permits only makes paths toward economic empowerment more difficult. Licensing fees or expanded designated areas for vendors may resolve alleged garbage problems that some tenants raise.
It seems obvious that a ban on street vending in Los Angeles is an attempt at the erasure of an indelible part of the city. The city must take into account thriving businesses that not only foster vibrant street cultures but also provide critical support for mostly immigrant families. Understanding the people and businesses behind the pushcarts may be more important than the sight of sidewalk congestion and competition.
Andy, how many times have you ate from a street vendor, especially a Hispanic one? When I was a student here, at USC, during home football games they’d be everywhere. One time, as I was waiting on the light where Hoover meets Jefferson, there was a vendor selling “Tijuana dogs” as we pejoratively called them. And this white chick, who I presume was an SC student, asks the vendor in a patronizing way, “What are these? What’s in it?” instead of just diving in, and trying one. So are you like this chick, who’s too squeamish to eat a “Tijuana dog” but likes to finger wag about helping the poor out, or do you support them by buying their items?
Nice insightful article because we must finally face the fact that immigrants and minorities are increasingly a major force in America. They and the children they bear account for 60 percent of our nation’s population growth, own 11 percent of US businesses, and are 60 percent more likely to start a new business than native-born Americans. In fact, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, creating 10 million jobs and seven out of ten top brands in our country.  
   More importantly, the vast majority of these human beings—both legal and undocumented—come to improve their lives and create a foundation of success for their children to build upon, bringing skills and a willingness to work hard to make their dreams a reality, something our founders did four hundred years ago, and something we would do today if we were in their shoes.
   Theodore Roosevelt: “We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.”
   However, most struggle in their efforts and need guidance in Anytown, USA. Perhaps intelligent immigration reform, White House/Congress and business/labor cooperation, concerned citizens and informative books can extend a helping hand, the same unwavering hand, lest we forget, that has been the anchor and lighthouse of American values for four hundred years.
   One new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help immigrants, int’l students and minorities and is endorsed by ambassadors, educators, and editors is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” 
Here’s a closing quote from the book’s Intro: “With all of our cultural differences though, you’ll be surprised to learn how much…we as human beings have in common on this little third rock from the sun. After all, the song played at our Disneyland parks around the world is ‘It’s A Small World After All.’ Peace.”

As former Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath penned in a recent Facebook post, “University administrators, whose primary concern should be their work with student scholars, have shifted their priorities to running a multi-billion dollar business.” Last Wednesday, the Sacramento Bee brought to light a stark reminder of that progression — UC Davis’ costly efforts to clean up its image by sweeping its 2011 pepper-spray incident under the cyber rug.
The newly released documents that the Sac Bee obtained through the California Public Records Act show that UC Davis has poured at least $175,000 into channeling certain aspects of its past out of reach — in particular, the documentation of police pepper-spraying students point-blank during an otherwise peaceful protest on Nov. 18, 2011. UC Davis’ very own chancellor, Linda P.B. Katehi, had sent for those forces.
Among those companies UC Davis contracted to scrub its online tracks was Nevins & Associates, hired to advise in the “eradication of references to the pepper spray incident in search results on Google for the university and Chancellor,” according to a copy of the contract.
To put it plainly, this is an instance of a publicly funded institution extracting money from California residents and its own students to fund an effort to keep those same individuals from accessing stories on negative campus incidents. There’s something wrong with this picture.
And yet, the administrators at UC Davis still don’t see it.
In a statement released Monday, Katehi justified the hiring of firms that specialized in “search engine optimization” as a way to paint a more complete picture of the campus for potential donors.
“None of our communications efforts were intended — or attempted — to erase online content or rewrite history,” Katehi said. “At UC Davis, we live with the lessons of 2011 every day.”
The history of disconnect between her words and her actions is outrageous. The fact that Katehi hadn’t been ousted in 2011 shows that this isn’t a case of one bad apple. It points to an ugly truth: that the upper ranks have been turning a blind eye to not only her missteps for years, but also the many students and faculty who have voiced their concerns vehemently to no avail.
Immediately after the 2011 incident, Nathan Brown, an assistant English professor at the school, wrote in an open letter to Katehi, “I call for your resignation because you are unfit to do your job. You are unfit to ensure the safety of students at UC Davis. In fact: you are the primary threat to the safety of students at UC Davis.”
Yet, despite the vocal concerns of Brown and many others, Katehi was able to stay on, only to make more missteps. Since 2011, she has moonlighted on various boards, including that of DeVry Education Group, a for-profit college currently being sued by the Federal Trade Commission — positions that were blatant conflicts of interest for a leader of a public university. It’s clear that even if Katehi keeps her job, she won’t be able to resolve the confidence she’s lost with the student body.
While it’s reached this point, however, according to the Sac Bee, UC President Janet Napolitano still maintains that though Katehi has made mistakes, she is still a good chancellor who should remain at UC Davis.
As UC Davis third-year physics department graduate student Connor Gorman told campus newspaper The Aggie, “There’s also the larger structural problem associated with universities […] being moved more toward a corporate model that prioritizes profit […] over students.” Blogger Scott Shackford also captured the issue well by framing it as “another example of colleges no longer fulfilling their roles as defenders of speech and openness, combined with abusive police behavior, with an added dash of the administrative bloat that’s driving up higher education costs.”
With tuition hikes even here at USC, it’s clear that those fears and anxieties are real and present beyond UC Davis. The memorandum that Provost Michael Quick sent out Tuesday could be a step toward transparency, but students and faculty still need to maintain vigilance and voice.
UC Davis has demonstrated this need well. For more than a month, since March 11, students camped out on the fifth floor of Mrak Hall to pressure Katehi into resigning. On April 15, the UC Student Association voted in favor of her resignation. The Sac Bee has taken definitive strides to hold culpable parties accountable. All these efforts go to show that though the system has failed to listen to the cries of concern sounding over the span of five years, the press, the faculty and, above all, the students will not stand still and tolerate its shortcomings.
