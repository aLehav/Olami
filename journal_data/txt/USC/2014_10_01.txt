Lazarex on Campus, a student organization founded last year to support the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, hosted runner Julie Weiss on Wednesday for a screening of the documentary Spirit of the Marathon II.

Spirit of the Marathon II captures Weiss and six other runners as they complete the Rome Marathon. This race was the first in Weiss’s mission to complete 52 marathons in 52 weeks to raise $1 million for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network after she lost her father to the disease in 2010.
Weiss now serves as a brand ambassador for the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit organization that links cancer patients with FDA-approved clinical trails and provides financial support for treatment and travel costs. She also leads the fundraising efforts of Lazarex’s Team for Life, which raises money to support the foundation through endurance sports.
“I think the movie will inspire people, not just to run a marathon but, also to fundraise for the cause,” said Joanna Liang, co-founder of Lazarex on Campus. “I think having Julie Weiss there will be inspiring because she runs for a cause that is so great.”
Weiss completed her goal to run 52 marathons in 52 weeks in 2013 at the ASICS Los Angeles Marathon. She said she became involved with the Lazarex Cancer Foundation because she strongly believed in the support system the program provides, as well as the opportunity to offer end stage cancer patients one more option.
“I really enjoy being part of the team, and how we all support each other, we’re all in this together,” Weiss said. “It’s kind of like a family that no one wants to be a part of — the pancreatic cancer community — but we get together to support each other and lift each other up.”
Lazarex Cancer Foundation started Team for Life as a fundraising campaign due to the connection between crossing the finish line of a marathon, and crossing the finish line in fighting cancer. For Weiss, this connection holds true in every race she runs.
“I dedicate each run to someone affected by cancer,” Weiss said. “I think about the person I’m running for, someone who passed away or still fighting cancer, or [a] survivor because it provides a deeper meaning to the whole event and inspires everyone around you.”
Lesley Allison, Lazarex on Campus’s liason to the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, said the screening of Spirit of the Marathon II supports the three-pronged mission of Lazarex on Campus: to raise awareness about the Lazarex Cancer Foundation, to reach the local community through working with the Joint Educational Project to teach students healthy living and cancer prevention, and to fundraise directly for the foundation as well as through Team for Life. This year, 10 members of Lazarex on Campus will train as group for the Star Wars 10K at Disneyland, and run with Team for Life. Lazarex on Campus is also planning to have a group train for the L.A. Marathon in March.
“We hope the documentary screening will generate interest in Lazarex on Campus as a club itself. We’re trying to keep it open, and a place for everyone because we can use any and all support we can get,” Allison said.
Allison has been supporting Lazarex on Campus co-founders Liang and Lexi Riopelle as they have worked to lay the foundation for the organization throughout the past year. This year there are about 20 members of Lazarex on Campus, Jiang said.
“I just think they are an amazing group of students,” Allison said. “[Liang and Riopelle] in particular put a lot of time and energy into the foundation. Laying the foundation is the hardest piece so they’ve taken time, effort and dedication.”
Erin Wright, a junior majoring in psychology, became involved in Lazarex on Campus when the organization started because the Lazarex Cancer Foundation was founded in her hometown, and she volunteered for the organization growing up.
“Cancer is so prevalent today. Everyone knows someone who is affected by cancer and Lazarex is such a great organization because the money doesn’t go to research but directly to end stage cancer patients who need that money to prolong their life,” Wright said.

On Wednesday night, the the Society of Women Engineers, Engineers Without Borders and the Undergraduate Student Government hosted Rick Baily, vice president of engineering, mission assurance and product support at Boeing Defense, Space & Security to speak about his leadership experiences at the company. The event was titled “What’s Harder — Strategic Leadership or Rocket Science?”
Career launch · Rick Baily, vice president of engineering, mission assurance and product support at Boeing, speaks to students on campus. – Samhita Swamy | Daily Trojan
Named the National Management Association’s 2014 Executive of the Year, Baily was invited to speak about his career both as a rocket scientist and manager of 30,000 employees as a part of an initiative by Engineers Without Borders to teach its members leadership strategy.
The Society of Women Engineers and Engineers Without Borders have had an extensive relationship with Boeing, as the company has funded several student initiatives.
John Davy, president of Engineers Without Borders, said that he hoped advice from Baily’s speech would benefit the organization in its project for the semester.
Davy said that Engineers Without Borders seeks to “help developing communities that have an engineering need.”
This semester’s project focuses on building a community center in the Coachella Valley that will serve nearly 3,000 people, according to Davy.
Despite being a UCLA graduate, Baily touched upon his reason for wanting to speak with USC students in particular.
“[Viterbi is] one of only 17 schools in the world that [Boeing calls its] accelerated hiring schools,” Davy said.
Bailey addressed some of the strategic challenges that arise in engineering companies and also shared lessons from his background in mechanical engineering, recounting some of his greatest successes and failures.
“The aerospace industry has one of the biggest challenges,” he said. “In five years, half of Boeing engineering is going to be eligible for retirement. In 10 years, if they do the average, half will have retired. That’s a big challenge for us.”
He dedicated a significant portion of his speech to the importance of teamwork.
When asked about when to make an executive decision rather than consulting with a group, Baily said that leaders must utilize their analytical skills.
He advised the audience “to have parameters of when a decision has to be made.”
“He grew very organically — he didn’t get an MBA or any of that stuff, but now he’s doing project management so it seems like he blended some holistic experiences rather than just going suit and tie and doing the standard finance, accounting, whatever,” said Aydin Celebi, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering and history.
Zhuohan Yu, a graduate student in mechanical engineering, said she originally attended the event because Rick Bailey is a high-ranking professional of Boeing who would have valuable insight into internship opportunities.
When asked her biggest take-away, however, she noted “Bailey’s emphasis on building human relationships” because, as she put it, “[engineers] tend to focus on technical skills.”
At the end of his speech, Baily advised the audience on interview tips and recruitment. He told students to gain knowledge of technical principles in their field, attain practical experience through projects, develop a proactive leadership style, learn how to articulate their knowledge and differentiate themselves from the crowd.
“We really value practical, real world experience,” he said. “You need hands-on experience. Focus on the technical areas you are going to work in.”

The USC Gould School of Law and the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy and Ethics hosted a panel on Wednesday to discuss mental health in college for the Institute’s Fall lecture, “In Real Life and as Seen on TV: Stories of Mental Health on Campus.”

Panel members included Jessie Close, a mental health activist; actor Eric McCormack, who plays a neuroscience professor with paranoid schizophrenia in the television show Perception; Gould School of Law professor Elyn Saks and Gould student Sam Brown.
Close and Brown, who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and Saks, who lives with schizophrenia, shared their personal experiences with their diseases, ranging from their first hospitalizations to how the disease has affected their relationships.
Though McCormack does not battle a mental illness, he spoke about what he has learned from playing a character that struggles with his disease and does not take medication. McCormack said that playing the role of Dr. Pierce made him more aware of the problem that the stigma of mental illness causes in our society.
When McCormack landed the role of Dr. Pierce, he read Saks’ autobiography, and then sought her out to learn more about what life is like living with schizophrenia.
“The stigma of mental illness is a result of ignorance,” he said. “People fear and despise what they don’t understand, and the media only discusses mental illness after a mass shooting, which only increases the fear.”
Panelists spoke about the idea that college is a crucial time for those who are struggling with mental illness. Symptoms of mental illness might first appear due to the stress and pressures that can come with college. For this reason, Saks said it is imperative to raise awareness of these symptoms.
“We do sex education, driver education. Why don’t we do mental [health] education so we know what the signs and symptoms are?” Saks said. She went on to share that she experienced some of her worst schizophrenic episodes while she was at Oxford University and Yale Law School.
Brown, now a third year law student, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 18, soon before he was supposed to move from Chicago to Los Angeles to attend his freshman year at UCLA. Once at UCLA, Brown said he felt strong support from his community.
During Brown’s third year at UCLA, he experienced his second psychotic break, and it was his fraternity brothers who brought him to the hospital. It was this sense of community that was essential for him to have a successful college experience.
Close, who said she did not come to terms with her illness until she was about 50-years-old, did not have as stable a support system during her college years. She spoke about dropping out of high school, and later going to community college and then American University despite doubts from her family that she would succeed.
“If you live with mental illness, take care of yourself, keep pushing, stay in school and don’t give up,” Close said. “You have to try, try, try again.”
Despite Brown and Close’s different experiences confronting bipolar disorder, both said they have felt the stigma associated with mental illness. For Brown, this moment came after his second hospitalization when he was not asked back as an employee at a summer camp.
“It was then I realized that being tight-lipped about being bipolar wasn’t the worst,” he said.
Saks also spoke about the self-stigma associated with mental illness, which is something that she struggles with herself. She and McCormack agreed that teaching empathy is important in erasing the stigma attached to mental illness.
“It’s hard to teach empathy, but we’re in a good place to do that when everyone is here for higher learning and higher understanding,” McCormack said.

USC held the opening ceremony for Wallis Annenberg Hall on Wednesday with speeches from Dean Ernest Wilson III, President C.L. Max Nikias and namesake Wallis Annenberg.

The 88,000-square-foot building serves as the flagship facility for the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It has been open to students since the start of the fall 2014 semester and offers a combined platform for print, television, online and digital journalism with a mission to provide a comprehensive education for Annenberg students.
Dean Wilson opened the ceremony by expressing his pride and gratitude for the new facility.
“Thank you to the team that helped translate blueprints into the glorious building you see in front of you today,” he said.
He emphasized that instead of isolating people from one another, technology should encourage collaboration.
“We saw the need for 21st century spaces that are not containers, but are connectors, that are places of innovation, not inhibition,” Wilson said.
Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life, said that narrative plays an important role in creating one’s own stories.
“We don’t control nature or nurture in our lives,” Soni said. “We are the authors of our own narrative and we are constantly writing the pages of our story.”
Soni encouraged the students of Annenberg to transform storytelling in the age of digital media.
“May Annenberg continue to shine as a global beacon for the arts,” Soni said.
Echoing Wilson, Nikias centered on ways that the new building will allow for greater collaborative processes.
“You see how beautiful the building is?” he said. “I tell everyone it gives us a thousand years of history we don’t have in its looks. It is full of open spaces that encourage liberation.”
Nikias said that the building’s central location held significance.
“This building stands at the heart of our university, and that is no coincidence,” Nikias said. “In the digital age of journalism, communication lies in the heart of human connectivity. Here, students will balance the demands for instantaneous information with the time-tested tradition of storytelling.”
Wallis Annenberg then spoke to inspire students to make the best use of the new building. The philanthropist focused on the new era of journalism, and encouraged students to make the most of it.
“This is your playground. This is your place to take risks. This is your place to test what works and [what] doesn’t,” Annenberg said.
She spared no words in describing her pride in the building, highlighting how well the newsroom stands among other local facilities.
“USC Annenberg already had the second largest newsroom in Los Angeles. Now it has what I think is the best newsroom,” she said.
President Nikias then thanked Annenberg for the $50 million gift from the Annenberg Foundation toward the facility by presenting her with a bouquet of orchids, as well as a plaque with an engraved head of USC’s mascot, Traveler.
Annenberg was followed by USC alumna and MSNBC News anchor Alex Witt, who  reminded students of the essence of journalism.
“Regardless of technical skills you need, and you will most [assuredly] get them here, you must always learn to write,” she said.
Students said the building’s design added to its educational value.
“I’m not as familiar with the building, but I love the classrooms upstairs — they have glass sliding doors, they’re all windows, everything’s open,” said Holly Thompson, a freshman majoring in narrative studies. “I love that type of architecture, and I think it’s a better studying environment.”
The ceremony concluded with Annenberg, Nikias, Wilson and Witt cutting the ribbon for the new hall. Afterwards, Nikias gave Annenberg a personal tour of the building while the rest of the attendees were invited inside for a reception with alumni and trustees.
“Having access to the new equipment … and having all of the news outlets together in one place is a really great environment,” said Kristin Doidge, a graduate student studying journalism. “It is also, from what I understand, even better than a real newsroom.”
Nikias stressed that this access to state of the art equipment is reflective of the commitment USC has to the future.
“This building, but more importantly, what goes in the building, is making a statement about USC: that we have the very best journalism school, arguably in the world,” Nikias told the Daily Trojan. “It also makes a big statement for the university of how committed we are for this profession.”

A mother in the first track of Weezer’s newest album says “Everything will be alright in the end.” This intro is an overarching theme of the album, as the familiar lyrics about girls and loneliness mix with nostalgia and reflection to create an idea of what’s to come for both the band’s lead singer and songwriter Rivers Cuomo and Weezer as a whole. Cuomo has written almost every Weezer song since their inception in ‘92, and although his life has changed (now he’s married with a kid) he still rocks out like no other.
Multifaceted · Rivers Cuomo, Weezer’s frontman, describes the album as having three distinct sections: Songs about girls, songs about fans and songs about fathers. The band’s songs about parenthood mark sensitive territory for Cuomo, and he navigates it all very well. – Photo courtesy of Republic Records
There are intense guitar solos throughout the album, and while the lyrics of the album aren’t as edgy as the old Weezer, who used to sing about mistaking lesbian girls as straight and being tired of having sex, they reflect the maturation Cuomo has gone through in his personal life.
One particular track, “Foolish Father,” describes his relationship with his kid and references the album title heavily, proclaiming to his children that “Everything will be alright in the end” over and over again, almost as a reassurance of himself rather than for his kid. While it is a new experience to hear Cuomo talk about his child, he does so with the same grunge rock overtones as all of his greatest work.
The tracks feel as much like classic Weezer as the band’s first efforts 20 years ago, but are also fresh and gritty, giving the album a new spin on an old style. There is mourning and reflection on Everything Will Be Alright In The End, which comes as only natural for such an established act. Many of the songs, like “Back To The Shack” and “Eulogy For a Rock Band” take a retrospective look on the band’s career, and with the latter comes a somber view of the past, comparing the band members to heroes who are over the hump. These two tracks are second and third on the album, and they preface the rest of the album by telling the audience that this Weezer is more like the one from the Blue Album, rather than more recent iterations.
In “Back To The Shack,” Cuomo references the notoriously experimental stage of Weezer’s career, starting around Raditude in 2009 when the band featured artists like Lil’ Wayne on their tracks. He equates it to a mistake.
“I thought I’d get a new audience / I forgot that disco sucks” are his words regarding this stage in the band’s history, and it is refreshing to hear Weezer in their old glory again.
It’s been four years since their previous album, Hurley, which was the last of a yearly offering by the band from 2008-2010. The longer break clearly allowed Rivers Cuomo and all of Weezer to reconnect with their old sound, as none of the songs made in that time period fit with their older work or this newer album.
After outlining what you are about to hear on this album in the first few songs, Weezer dives into the lonely grunge they are so good at playing, with tracks like “I’ve Had It Up To Here” and “Go Away” featuring Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast that sound like what Pinkerton would sound like if it wasn’t self-produced.
Everything Will Be Alright In The End was split into three sections according to Cuomo in an interview with Rolling Stone. There are songs about girls, songs about fans and songs about fathers, and he switches between them are clear to see. The album starts off about the fans, as Cuomo apologizes for the music he’s made recently, then talks about a slightly more dramatic topic — girls — in which he no longer has the same edge after his marriage. The songs in this section are strong, but they are not at all the old Weezer in terms of lyrics, which is why the last section is so vital. Whereas women used to be a key component of Cuomo’s life, his intentions have since changed. The songs about fathers are so strong because fatherhood is the centerpiece of Cuomo’s life at the moment. You can tell he is fearful, as in “Foolish Father,” and because of this, the last section of the album is the strongest by far.
After “Foolish Father,” the album closes with the “Futurescope Trilogy,” a three-song epic with minimal lyrics and a strong buildup to the final crash of the album. This is Weezer experimentation that works, and the final song, “The Futurescope Trilogy: III. Return to Ithaka” is a wordless anthem with a Van Halen-esque solo closing out the album. Although this trilogy is hard to decipher, the three songs are strong enough to not warrant a meaning. They are just powerful reminders of Weezer’s technical abilities, and they further solidify the greatness that is Everything Will Be Alright In The End.

Here in the shadow of Hollywood, it is a daunting task to carve out a niche in the bustling film festival scene. The Sunscreen Film Festival, happening in Hermosa Beach on Oct. 10-12, looks up to the challenge. Sprouting off from the very successful nine-year-old festival of the same name based in St. Petersburg, Florida, the Sunscreen Film Festival offers a wide variety of feature films, documentaries and shorts, as well as panels and workshops with industry members.
The festival has a strong focus on education, setting itself up as an alternative for aspiring filmmakers that lack the opportunity to attend a film school like the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Tony Armer, the co-founder and exective director of the original festival, sees it as one of the main distinguishing features of the festival.
“One of the unique things that we’ve become known for over the years are the educational workshops and stuff that we do,” Armer said. “Not everybody has the opportunity to go to film school or to have access to people who can really teach them something about film. So we have [had] great workshops over the years. You know, Oscar-nominated screenwriters, or producers and directors that are actively working in Hollywood.”
The Hermosa Beach festival is determined to tap into this central idea of education. Robert Enriquez, the co-founder of the West Coast iteration of the festival, has expanded this portion in the festival’s second year.
“The type of people who come to our film festivals are extremely eager and interested in learning about the industry as well, so we offer panels,” Enriquez said.
Notable professionals coming to the festival include Mitchell Bell, the head of physical production at Marvel Studios and Christi Sopher from casting at Dreamworks Animation. The panels they will be leading and the associated workshops are a strong point of emphasis for the organizers.
Sunscreen also focuses on involvement with in the community. Enriquez lives in Hermosa Beach and is passionate about using the festival to invigorate the local community. The main goal is to partner with local companies for the festival. Sharkey’s, a local restaurant, has emerged as a very important sponsor. On top of this, the overflow of festival goers invigorates the local community. Enriquez sees the location as an important factor in this.
“You want to have a reason to come,” Enriquez said. “It’s fun when you get to go to a destination-type spot and there’s things to do there if you’re going to spend the money, which a lot of these guys they don’t have a lot of money so its like we get to see our film, mingle with other filmmakers, and we’re also out on the beach and hang out on pier avenue and I think a lot of these guys are thrilled by that.”
The festival organizers are also trying to commission the trophies for the festival from a local glassmaker. In addition to these these indirect benefits to the South Bay community, the festival will donate one fourth of all VIP pass sales to the Hermosa Valley Parent Teachers Organization and the Hermosa Beach Educational Foundation. On top of this, Sunscreen is giving proceeds to the Hermosa Museum and the Hermosa Arts Foundation.
This passion about giving back to the community goes back to the original Floridian festival as well. Armer describes with pride the impact the festival has had on the St. Petersburg area.
“We had an economic impact study done that showed that, just over a couple of days, [there was] over a 400,000 dollar economic impact in the area,” Armer said. “[This came from] people coming and spending money on hotel rooms and flying in and going out to eat and spending money at local businesses.”
The ties to the original festival are strong, and with good reason. The festival has been named on a number of best-of festival lists and is one of only 23 film festivals sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Last year, the inaugural year for the Hermosa festival, the founders of the St. Peterson festival were very hands-on in helping to set up the festival. This year, the Hermosa festival has had its training wheels removed and has been allowed to ride very much on its own.
“It’s almost like having year one all over again.” Enriquez said, “We had a little more time to get sponsors, we had a little more time to reach out to peers in the industry throughout the year. I’ve actually switched venues.”
The ambition to grow the Hermosa iteration into a leading festival that matches the heights of the original St. Petersburg version or to even surpass them is unabashedly shared by Enriquez. “three years, five years down the line [we aim to] grow in to Manhattan Beach, Redondo beach, El Segundo and Torrance. And let [the festival] grow and become something like a Sundance, or Newport, or Telluride or any of these other festivals.” Enriquez said, “Cause I feel like we have a lot to offer down here.”
The quality of the individual films is almost an afterthought at this festival’s fledgling stage. The sheer variance in the selections, however, is another point of emphasis for the festival as the creators strive for a varied demographic of different festivalgoers. Beyond the targeted slice of young filmmakers, the festival also hopes to attract families with kid-friendly entertainment. The opening night movie, for example, is Hoovey, a family film. That film also continues the trend of embracing the community as its director and producer both live in the South Bay. There will also be a youth trailer competition for children under 18 with a screening on Sunday of the ten best trailers judged by representatives from Lionsgate and Dreamworks.
The festival is still in its early days but shows the potential for great growth through its optimal location, dedication to education, community involvement and, perhaps most importantly, vision from the creators. It might be quite the anecdote many years on to be able to say you went to the first real Sunscreen Film Festival.

In the 1980s and early ’90s, Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union satellites were experiencing the growing pains of democratic revolutions, highlighted by the bloody end of the rule of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu. Twenty years later, the democratic fever of the world spread to the Middle East. And now, three years later, it appears the democracy bug has spread to the Far East, as protesters, many of them students, have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to demand autonomy in the election of its leaders. Dubbed the “Umbrella Revolution,” so named due to protesters’ use of umbrellas to protect against weather, pepper spray and tear gas during mass demonstrations, protests have sparked democratic fever among the citizens of Hong Kong.
This past weekend in Hong Kong, there was an unprecedented turnout of people in front of government headquarters. As the Arab Spring introduced to us the power of social media in initiating social and political change in the modern context, the Umbrella Revolution, thus far, has taught us the true potential of technology in the 21st century and the need to use it to continue the fight against this status quo.
Since Great Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city has become a “special administrative region” with a high degree of autonomy, with China promising the city a democratically elected leader in the future. Currently, the leader of Hong Kong is appointed by a committee made up of strong-armed Communist Party loyalists. Beijing has promised elections to allow Hong Kong to independently elect its chief executive by 2017. Last August, the Communist Party said it would vet candidates through a committee and voters would vote to elect from a ballot preordained by Beijing. Furious with the lack of democratic process, last weekend, students staged boycotts and sit-ins in front of the office of the Hong Kong chief executive. In the short term, protesters want the resignation of the current leader of Hong Kong, Leung Chun-ying, who is extremely unpopular and a symbol of the status quo those in Hong Kong wish to erase. Long term, protesters desire full autonomy to elect their own leader, free of vetting from Beijing and meddling by the Communist Party.
Democracy is inevitable in a city like Hong Kong. Highly Westernized, historically tied with Great Britain from 1842 to 1997 and the economic and financial hub of Asia, Hong Kong is too different from the Communist regime of China. Democracy is part of Hong Kong’s genetic makeup, and technology is ushering a new era of empowerment for it.
China traditionally censors most content on the Internet that undermines the ruling party or introduces democratic ideas. The number of online sites blocked, from Instagram to Facebook to Twitter, is astounding, especially in this day and age of globalization — and it’s time for the censorship to stop. China’s favorite micro-blogging site, Sina Weibo, commonly known as “China’s Twitter,” is also heavily monitored and censored, with any mentions of the protests in Hong Kong removed. With social media blocked and the internet heavily limited, the protesters have shown the strength of social media and the fervor of citizens demanding democracy and autonomy. Those in the streets have been able to communicate through the app FireChat, a messaging service that bypasses traditional cellular data and internet to send text messages. Users can communicate with one another through the app, which utilizes Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities of the user’s device to connect to people within a certain radius. Popular among concertgoers in the United States, the app is difficult to track and censor by the government and is easy to use, allowing protesters to coordinate without fear of being discovered or blocked. FireChat has been instrumental for protesters in Hong Kong, allowing for additional channels to be used to communicate.
In 2011, Facebook curried the favor of Egyptians and thousands of others in the Middle East and offered a platform to organize and protest autocratic regimes. Now, in 2014, democratic fever has reached Hong Kong, the impetus being technology as a means to organize and protest.
History is being made in Hong Kong, with the world liking, favoriting, retweeting and sharing the entire experience. With technology, this fight has become a global one, reminding us of the fundamental need to stand up for what we truly believe in, even when it means going up against the grain.

Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont-based ice cream manufacturer and store, recently received complaints asking the company to change the name of one of its flavors, “Hazed & Confused.” In 2008, Harrison Kowiak died during a fraternity “hell week” hazing ritual at Lenoir-Rhyne University in Hickory, North Carolina. His mother, Lianne, was offended by the flavor name and suggested retitling the chocolate hazelnut ice cream to “Harrison’s Hazelnut Hooray,” in honor of her son. Instead of merely rechristening the flavor, Ben & Jerry’s should take this opportunity to speak out against hazing culture.
Jennifer Frazin and Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
Ben & Jerry’s has already offered a statement to the family, and, in an email to the Huffington Post, made it clear that they never meant to associate the name with hazing rituals. “Ben & Jerry’s believes that hazing and bullying have no place in our society,” the company said in the email. “No individual, group or entity should benefit by marginalizing others.” The company’s spokesperson, Sean Greenwood, adds “The ice cream contains hazelnuts, so it was always meant as a pop culture reference to ‘Dazed and Confused,’” a Led Zeppelin song as well as a 1993 teen comedy.
Ben & Jerry’s is a socially minded company with clear political views and clever flavor names. They should take this unintentional association as an opportunity to put their ice cream where their press statement is and speak out against hazing. Given the company’s prominence, and popularity with college students, an anti-hazing campaign could make an impact. According to Bloomberg, the Kowiak’s late son was a Ben & Jerry’s fan; it seems that raising awareness about hazing culture would be a better tribute than simply renaming the ice cream.
Hazing is the use of peer pressure and other coercive means to make individuals participate unwillingly in activities. Though most commonly associated with fraternity and sorority initiation, hazing can take place in a number of contexts. Incidents range from psychological abuses to physical harm, such as forced displays of public nudity or forced, excessive consumption of alcohol. These rituals ostensibly initiate new members into an organization — bonding them together through traumatic experiences. Instead of using harmful tactics to create bonds, organizations should use positive experiences to form relationships.
Even though the blending of ice cream and social causes might seem like a stretch, Ben & Jerry’s has successfully combined company political views with ice cream in the past, in addition to using non-genetically modified ingredients and recyclable packaging.
In 2009, Chubby Hubby — a notoriously popular ice cream flavor — was renamed Hubby Hubby in support of the legalization of same-sex marriage in Vermont. According to Cone Communications, the ice cream name change and accompanying promotional campaign increased Freedom To Marry Web site traffic by 720 percent and prompted a 45 percent increase in signers to the nonprofit’s Marriage Resolution.
The same year, Ben & Jerry’s introduced Yes Pecan! ice cream to support President Barack Obama and raise funds for the Common Cause Education Fund. This month, the company unveiled Satisfy My Bowl, a flavor not currently available in the United States, which gives proceeds to Bob Marley’s 1Love Foundation. Despite the name’s allusion to marijuana, the company has not received significant adverse reactions.
Ben & Jerry’s seems to know when to rename and when to let the flavors speak for themselves. This should also be the case for Hazed & Confused. Despite complaints from the conservative One Million Moms group about their limited-run Schweddy Balls flavor, the ice cream company stood their ground. The ice cream name is a play off a 1998 Saturday Night Live skit featuring Alec Baldwin as baker Pete Schweddy and demonstrates the ice cream company’s love of of the show. According to the Huffington Post, the flavor in question soon became one of the company’s most popular. The immense customer response to the fudge-covered rum ball ice cream shows that the name was not risqué enough to put people off their ice cream. Similarly, their Karamel Sutra ice cream — with its clear sexual innuendo — has yet to evoke public criticism. Thus, Hazed & Confused’s unintentional association with hazing should not be grounds for the company to modify it.
In fact, Hazed & Confused should be used to promote social awareness of hazing culture. Now is the ideal time for Ben & Jerry’s to capitalize on this naming issue. Ben & Jerry’s has the resources and visibility to turn this public relations fiasco around by using their chocolate hazelnut ice cream for social good. Nothing could be sweeter.

The USC women’s soccer team hopes to keep the wins coming this weekend, as Pac-12 conference play heats up with games against Colorado and Utah.
Syd the kid · Freshman midfielder Sydney Sladek was named USC’s Student-Athlete of the Week for scoring her first career goal last Friday. – Samuel Chang | Daily Trojan
 
The No. 23 Women of Troy (7-1-2, 1-0 Pac-12) successfully began their trek through the tough slate of Pac-12 games by traveling to the Arizona desert and defeating the Lady Wildcats by a score of 3-0 on Sept. 26 thanks to yet another great second half performance.
“The first half was okay, but the second half I thought we adjusted very well to their tactics,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “It was a great result for us.”
Senior midfielder Alex Quincey claimed the score that opened up the game for the Women of Troy, as she added to her team-leading tally of seven goals, putting her at second place among all Pac-12 players. Freshman midfielder — and USC Student-Athlete of the Week — Sydney Sladek also had a stellar performance, scoring her first career goal and assisting the second goal of the match scored by junior forward Katie Johnson.
Now the road gets slightly tougher for the Women of Troy as they’ll be faced with not one, but two conference games this weekend. Though the games will be at home in the friendly confines of McAlister Field, the team will look to fend off a Colorado squad hungrily looking for its first conference win and a Utah squad that has remained undefeated through its first 10 matches.
The Lady Buffaloes (7-3-0, 0-1) — who made the Sweet 16 in last year’s NCAA tournament — lost their first Pac-12 duel in a 4-2 shootout with California this past week and will now attempt to upset USC on its home pitch at 3 p.m. this Friday.
“[Colorado] will be hungry to come in here and re-establish themselves,” McAlpine said. “It’s gonna be a tough game for us.”
Key players for Colorado include forward Brie Hooks, who leads the team with four goals to go with her three assists. Two other Lady Buffaloes — midfielders Darcy Jerman and Carly Bolyard -— have added three goals.
Defensively, the team is anchored by goalkeeper Kate Scheele, who can claim five clean sheets and 28 saves in 2014.
The Women of Troy recognize that all conference teams are dangerous, but by adhering to their “one game at a time” mindset and refusing to focus on anything but the next opponent, they know they can avoid unnecessary losses. McAlpine continues to be adamant about this and is focused on getting the team to treat this game — regardless of its adversary — like any other Pac-12 match.
Sunday’s game places the squad on the opposite side of a place they were for most of this season. Having been undefeated until the last game of non-conference play against Pepperdine, the Women of Troy faced many teams that tried to end their winning streak. Now, they will be the ones attempting to play spoiler as they face the unranked, but dangerous, Utah Lady Utes (7-0-3, 0-0-1) at 3 p.m. on Sunday.
Utah is led by midfielder Katie Taylor, who has added three goals to her team-best five assists. Freshman forward Mariah Elmer, who has yet to start a game, also has three goals.
Goalkeeper Lindsey Luke has been a wall so far this season, collecting 40 saves and six shutouts.
“Utah is playing extremely well,” McAlpine said. “They’re a very, very dangerous team.”
The Lady Utes have certainly impressed so far, surviving a tough draw against No. 4 Stanford in their last game and simultaneously keeping their spotless record of only draws and wins alive. They will face No. 1 UCLA on Friday for what is sure to be another tough match before taking on the Women of Troy in their second game of the weekend.
“[Colorado and Utah] are a little different in their approach, but still two very quality teams,” McAlpine said. “The weekend’s gonna be one that will challenge us in a couple ways.”
Pac-12 play is beginning to get interesting, and with hopes of an NCAA tournament berth and even tougher games on the horizon, the Women of Troy will look to make the most of home-field advantage and come out of this weekend unscathed and undefeated in conference play.
This weekend’s games mark the first quarter of five-match homestand for USC. The Women of Troy begin play again on Oct. 10 against California.

Each week, ESPN’s Pac-12 college football blog ranks the conference’s top-five quarterbacks. Though the list is an attempt to showcase notable performances more than anything else, this Tuesday’s rankings — which put USC redshirt junior Cody Kessler in the fifth slot — got me thinking.
If you had to start a college football team, which Pac-12 quarterback would you pick up first? This isn’t a fantasy draft — sorry Connor Halliday — but an honest attempt to figure out the best man for the job. In a conference laden with talent at the position, this isn’t an easy task. So to all you die-hard Kevin Hogan supporters out there, my email address is in the attribution. Anyway, here’s my Pac-12 top-12.
The cream of the crop
1. Marcus Mariota (Oregon)
2. Brett Hundley (UCLA)
3. Cody Kessler (USC)
I know, I know. One of these guys is not like the others. But let’s take a blind look at some stats. Player one has completed 72 percent of his passes for 1107 yards, 10 touchdowns and no interceptions. Player two: 74 percent, 1135 yards, 13 touchdowns, no picks. Player three: 72 percent, 1041 yards, seven scores, one pick. These are all solid, comparable numbers, right? So before you knock Cody Kessler -— he’s player one, by the way — for being nothing more than “efficient,” you might want to attribute that label to Mariota (player two) and Hundley (player three) as well.
Yes, in the past Mariota and Hundley have been far better with their legs than Kessler will ever be. This season, however, that hasn’t necessarily been the case. Mariota is averaging just over 50 yards on the ground per game, while Hundley, in one less game, is averaging just under 50. Though these numbers are far better than Kessler’s, they aren’t staggering enough to knock him down a peg.
Let’s remember, two of these guys were considered preseason Heisman candidates, and Mariota is probably still the frontrunner for the award. This has to be frustrating for USC fans, who have watched Kessler develop into a picture of consistency while playing for a team that is anything but.
As to why Mariota takes the top spot? A 94.4 Adjusted Total Quarterback Rating says just about everything I could (that score is out of 100, by the way).
The stat-sheet Stars
4. Jared Goff (Cal)
5. Taylor Kelly (Arizona St.)
6. Sean Mannion (Oregon St.)
7. Connor Halliday (Washington St.)
Cal’s Goff was ESPN’s top choice this week, and for good reason: the sophomore put up a ridiculous 458 yards and seven touchdowns in a thrilling win over Colorado last Saturday. Though he -— along with Halliday and, to a lesser degree, Kelly — benefit from offensive systems that throw the ball about 300 times a game, Goff gets the nod among this group for consistently putting up crazy numbers on a team that lacks, uh, a lot. Couple his youth with an arm reminiscent of a former Bears gunslinger that now wears green and gold, and Goff seems like a better version of Kelly and Halliday.
The 6-foot-5 Mannion is the most prototypical NFL prospect in the conference, but has not carried over his impressive 2013 output into this season. The Beavers offense looked sluggish against USC, and Mannion seemed content to check the ball down or throw it away when he couldn’t find an open target. As much as those conservative sensibilities will help him at the next level, he can’t measure up to the playmaking abilities of Mariota or Hundley.
The enigmas
8. Kevin Hogan (Stanford)
9. Sefo Liufau (Colorado)
10. Travis Wilson (Utah)
What can you really say about these guys? Hogan has two Pac-12 championships on his resume, but has thrown for over 300 yards in a game just once in nearly two full seasons as a starter. As solid as he looked earlier this season against the Trojans, no one would argue that Hogan was the MVP of either of the last two Stanford teams.
Liufau took over Colorado’s starting job with seven games remaining last season, and proceeded to throw eight interceptions. Though he has shown promise in 2014 — the Buffaloes were on the losing end of a score-for-score shootout with Goff and the Bears on Saturday — Liufau’s team has yet to win back-to-back games with him at the helm.
Wilson, on the other hand, is just a plain old good story. A concussion nearly ended his promising career midway through last season, and the junior was only cleared to play this season after passing multiple extensive tests. Unfortunately, Wilson hasn’t quite performed up to his usual standards this season, and didn’t manage a touchdown pass in the Utes’ one-point loss to Washington State on Saturday.
The new guys
11. Anu Solomon (Arizona)
12. Cyler Miles (Washington)
Though there isn’t much to say about Miles just yet, Solomon has been quietly making a name for himself in the desert. I mean, It’s fitting that the second-to-last last quarterback on my list already has a 47-yard game-winning Hail Mary to his name. Solomon, just a redshirt freshman, found wideout Austin Hill with a remarkable pass on the last play of the Wildcats’ wild come-from-behind win over Cal a few weeks ago. Suffice it to say, if you start at quarterback in this conference, you’re probably pretty damn good.

The Trojans went about their normal Wednesday practice routine ahead of their first game against a Pac-12 South rival. The team will look to remain unbeaten at home when it faces the Arizona State Sun Devils on Saturday.
Hayes of glory · Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard and the Trojans are ready to put last year’s blowout loss to Arizona State behind them. Pullard is tied for second on the team with 26 total tackles so far this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Defense First
The Trojans struggled against Boston College’s dynamic offense three weeks ago, a similar attack to that of the Sun Devils. That being said, a lot of attention was focused on the defense at practice on Wednesday and how it would deal with the Sun Devils’ potential explosiveness.
The main difference in USC’s defensive strategy is the official change of sophomore Su’a Cravens from safety to linebacker. While it gives the Trojans a new look on that side of the ball, it seems to suit their needs on the field.
“The plan wasn’t to change my position; it was more just to fit where they needed me,” Cravens said. “I like being close to the ball. I like to make plays.”
Freshman defensive back Adoree’ Jackson did not seem worried about Arizona State’s offensive weapons and said he is looking forward to the challenge that the Sun Devils’ multi-scheme spread offense poses for the USC defense.
“This will be the biggest game because it’s our next game,” Jackson said. “I’m excited because it throws everything at us and gets to show off our versatility as a defense.”
Head coach Steve Sarkisian also stressed the importance of defense after the practice. He liked the focus and mindset of the team heading into this crucial game, but he gave a vote of confidence to his defensive players.
“To be plus-seven for us in the turnover margin is huge and will continue to be huge to our success,” Sarkisian said. “We have to trust our techniques, trust our fundamentals and at the moment of truth, we have to make the plays.”
No Repeat
The last time the Trojans faced the Sun Devils, they endured a rough defeat that eventually turned their season around. USC is not looking to meet a similar fate with its game this weekend, and some players are even using last season as motivation to get the victory.
“We have to make sure we’re prepared so it doesn’t happen again,” junior defensive end Leonard Williams said. “It’s going to be like a revenge game.”
Williams went on to describe how much the team has evolved since the tough loss last year.
“We’ve grown a lot,” he said. “When you have that trust grown on a team, it’s easier to play for each other.”
Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard agreed that the game is going to be tough but said that he does not think about last year’s matchup because USC is a totally new team.
“We always bring our lunch pail for the Pac-12 game,” Pullard said. “We’re competing for the championship every single day.”
Even though Sarkisian was not on the coaching staff last season, he noted last year’s defeat and hopes that it motivates his players to be better this time around.
“Hopefully it factors into our pride,” Sarkisian said. “It affects our preparation in the fact that it shouldn’t happen again.”
Injury Update
Most of practice had a positive vibe and an encouraging outlook for the rest of the week; however, there was one negative that emerged from the field on Wednesday.
Freshman wide receiver Ajene Harris suffered a strained hamstring that pulled him out of practice for the rest of the day. Coaches said they were unsure of the severity of the injury but were hopeful that he would be able to make a quick recovery and return to the field.
Without Harris, the Trojans now turn to redshirt freshman wide receiver Steven Mitchell, who gained more practice reps after the unfortunate injury to his teammate.
“When [Mitchell]’s at full speed, he’s a dynamic athlete,” Sarkisian said.
The first-year coach also said other players will have to step up to fill the void as well, but mentioned junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor’s flexibility to move around on offense as a main reason he is not too concerned.
“We always have the flexibility of moving Nelson [Agholor] around,” Sarkisian said. “[Mitchell] is really good, its just about developing confidence in him.”
