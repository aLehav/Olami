Thirty-two athletes from USC track and field will travel to Fayetteville, Ark. this week for the 2022 NCAA West Preliminary Rounds. 
Athletes with top 12 times or marks in their respective events will earn a berth to the NCAA Championships in Eugene, Ore. in June. 
“The team’s energy has been great all year when we travel,” Head Coach Quincy Watts said. “It’s good to see they know how to relax, and they know how to bring a sense of calm before the storm.” 
USC used the last day of the Pac-12 Track & Field Championships to climb the standings, as both the men’s and women’s teams benefitted from clutch performances to each finish in the top five. 
“Even though obviously we didn’t win, … we got people to step up in different places that we didn’t think was possible,” said senior sprinter Bailey Lear in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
USC’s men’s team finished third overall after sophomore Johnnie Blockburger won an individual title in the men’s 400m on the championship’s final day. The win was Blockburger’s second of his career in the Pac-12 Championship, posting a season-best time of 45.19.
Blockburger’s record-breaking day continued in the 4×100 relay, when, along with junior Nicholas Ramey, senior Eric Allen Jr. and graduate student Kasaun James, the team won the event with a time of 38.60. USC’s previous record for the event, 38.69, was set in 1980. 
On the final day of the championships, sophomore Jasmine Jones won the 100-meter hurdles and junior Jan’Taijah Ford won the women’s 400 meter, helping the women’s team vault from 11th to fourth place. 
“It’s nothing new to us because of the way that we’re made,” Watts said. “We always go into the last day down a lot of points, but we’ve always ran extremely well on day two.” 
Ford’s victory was the fifth consecutive women’s 400m Pac-12 title for USC.  
The 400 is always dominant for us,” Lear said. “Usually schools call us ‘400 Meter [University]’ because we’re so powerful in the 400.” 
USC will look to carry their momentum to the NCAA West Preliminary Rounds, where the competition is sure to heat up. With 48 participants competing in individual events, there will be plenty of opportunities for USC athletes to advance past the NCAA preliminary round. 
In the women’s 100m race, graduate student Celera Barnes leads all athletes with a time of 10.82, earning her the first seed in the race. Just behind Barnes at the seventh seed is freshman Samirah Moody. 
“These young ladies have worked extremely hard, especially Celera Barnes. I’m looking for a breakout for her,” Watts said.  
Moody, who started with the team in January, also garnered high praise from her coach. 
“Samirah is just a phenomenal freshman,” Watts said. “She’s off to a tremendous start and just looking for her now to find her legs and gain some experience.” 
For both the 4x100m and 4x400m relay preliminaries, USC is seeded fifth with UCLA just behind in sixth. The pressure will be high as the Trojans look to continue their successful season. 
“We don’t even call it regionals because it’s like the first part of nationals,” Lear said. 
Lear will join Ford in the 400m dash preliminary round. Both athletes are seeded in the top 15. 
Blockburger is the No. 2 seed in the men’s 400m dash preliminary round. With a time over a half second shorter than the event’s No. 1 seed, Texas senior Jonathan Jones, Blockburger might have to beat his own season-best time in order to win the event. 
The NCAA Preliminary Round will begin May 25 on the University of Arkansas campus and will be livestreamed on the NCAA website.

Being a fan of the Los Angeles Sparks for the first three weeks has been like a ride on Space Mountain — it’s undeniably fun but has left fans in the dark about what is coming next. You can’t see what’s ahead of you, so there’s no predicting when you’ll experience a dip or turn. Like the iconic Disneyland attraction, the Sparks’ season has been a ride full of chaos in the darkness. 
However, in such an unpredictable season, one thing has been obvious so far: the way this team is embracing the spirit of L.A. is special. 
It doesn’t get more L.A. than signing the biggest, loudest and at times, most dominant player in the entire league. Liz Cambage’s arrival has been Shaq-esque. She’s dominated the paint on offense and defense, screaming at her hapless opponents as she overpowers them for buckets or blocks. 
To make things even more intriguing, Cambage has a skill that Shaq never had: her 3-point shot. If you somehow keep her out of the paint, she has shown that she can hit shots from as far away as 40 feet. It’s a small sample size, but Cambage has shot 50% from three through six games. With her dominant play and unapologetically passionate personality, she’s sure to be a fan favorite for her entire Sparks career. 
Welcome to Liz Angeles. 
Cambage may be the flashiest new addition, but she surely isn’t the only one that’s bringing more L.A. swag to the Sparks. When you mention the basketball DNA of L.A., Jordin Canada’s name naturally follows. 
Air Jordin has always resided in L.A. — she was born and raised in the City of Angels and played basketball at UCLA. However, her pro career took her to the Seattle Storm. 
Jordin had success up north, winning two WNBA titles and (fittingly) signing a deal with Jordan Brand. Yet, she never broke out as a true star for the Storm: Her points per game average was consistently under 10 points. 
It was time for her to return to the place where stars are made, and Los Angeles welcomed her back with open arms. 
So far, the pairing has looked like a perfect match. Canada is having her best season of her career by far through the first six games, leading the team in assists while also putting up a career-high 12.7 points per game.
With Canada, Cambage and a host of other players form arguably the most talented team in all of women’s basketball. 
So, they should be winning then, right? 
Well, they’re not. Through six games, the Sparks sit at 2-4. Despite all the highlight-reel plays that have come from all over the roster, the Sparks’ season has been defined by a four-game losing streak. 
The main issue driving the disappointing results has been an inability to close out games. Three of the Sparks losses have been by three points or less. 
These close losses haven’t been a result of meltdowns by the players, however. On the court, the Sparks have made clutch play after clutch play to keep themselves within striking distance of a win. 
However, there have been a few inexplicable coaching decisions that have been impossible to ignore. Against the Minnesota Lynx, Cambage was on the bench with less than 15 seconds remaining, leading to an easy basket in the paint for the Lynx. Odd play design in the last offensive possession doomed them in their last possession in the same game. The Sparks were also unable to get a good shot in the final seconds against the Atlanta Dream. 
And ultimately, the responsibility for those decisions lands on L.A. darling and Sparks Head Coach Derek Fisher. 
Fisher had plenty of memorable moments for the Lakers when he played, but his coaching career has been more laughable than magical. He was run out of the NBA in a year and a half and hasn’t been able to unlock the full potential of talented Sparks teams. This season has been more of the same. 
To make matters worse, he was notoriously bad in crunch time as the coach of the Knicks as well, resulting in his reputation for last-second failures as a coach. Perhaps the clutch gene has run out for D-Fish. 
But maybe not. Maybe he can lead the team on a run to the WNBA finals, or maybe he will be unable to unlock the potential of the Sparks once again, and we’ll be talking about another new basketball coach in L.A. in 2023.
Who knows, right? The edge-of-your-seat unpredictability has been a theme of the roller coaster type ride in the dark of a Sparks season so far. 
But no matter what happens, it will undeniably be a rich chapter in the history of L.A. sports culture.
Ethan Inman is a sophomore who recently became a fan of the LA Sparks and decided to write about them from a fan’s perspective. His column runs every other Wednesday.

While studying at the USC School of Law in the 1920s, You Chung “Y.C.” Hong wrote his thesis on the Chinese Exclusion Act, a prohibition on the immigration of Chinese laborers that lasted more than 60 years. The first Chinese American graduate of USC’s law school, Hong spent the greater part of his career as an attorney focused on reforming racist legislation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, and advocating for thousands of Chinese immigrants in America.
Hong’s story is documented in the newest season of the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West’s podcast, “Western Edition.” ICW — a joint teaching, education and outreach initiative between the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Huntington Library to investigate the history and culture of California and the American West — launched “Western Edition” in 2021. The podcast aims to connect the past and the present and share stories of the people and communities of the American West.
ICW kickstarted the release of the podcast’s second season, “Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown,” Tuesday and will continue to release episodes through June 28. Several USC faculty supported the research for “Western Edition’s” six-episode second season. 
“Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” will explore the history of one of Los Angeles’ oldest neighborhoods, a cultural and business hub popular among tourists and locals and a long-standing center for the Southern Californian Chinese American community. L.A. Chinatown offered Chinese immigrants pursuing the American Dream safety and connection, but also bore witness to challenging periods of displacement and racial discrimination.
“It’s important for people to understand the deeper history of Chinatown in L.A.,” said William Deverell, ICW director and professor of history. “It’s important to understand the ethnic and immigrant history of Los Angeles through that lens.”
“Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” releases amid a surge of racism and violence against Asian Americans following the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. NBC News reported that, in 2021, recorded anti-Asian hate crimes rose by 339% from 2020 levels, and many cities, including New York, San Francisco and L.A., surpassed their record numbers. 
“We also think it’s important, in a period of anti-Asian hate and violence, to talk about the long histories of those reflexes and that ugliness in the regional past, to put it into historical context, to remind people that tragically it’s not new and to see if we can utilize history to  build awareness and, hopefully, as a byproduct of that, build community,” Deverell said.
“Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” builds off of ICW’s ongoing Chinatown History Project.
Before the rise of “New Chinatown,” much of L.A.’s original Chinatown — a vibrant neighborhood home to thousands of people, apartments, boarding houses and restaurants — was demolished in the 1930s to make way for the construction of Union Station and other civic projects. 
Guided by a rich photo collection documenting “Old Chinatown,” the ICW’s Chinatown History Project is recovering the neighborhood with historical research and innovative augmented reality experiences. The project is a collaboration with historian Greg Hise, the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California and the Huntington Library.
According to a press release, the second season of “Western Edition” seeks to uncover a more comprehensive understanding of the past, present and future of L.A.’s Chinatown and promote a greater awareness of the neighborhood and its people. The season features interviews with longtime Chinatown residents, activists, artists and academics who can speak to the neighborhood and its community, said Jessica Kim, an associate professor of history at Cal State Northridge and ICW social media manager. 
“It’s this really rich tapestry of voices of people who’ve been, through family or through their academic work or their activism, involved in protecting Chinatown, protecting the legacy of the Chinese American community in Southern California, [and] thinking, too, about the future of Chinatown and in what ways is that community able to survive and face challenges such as gentrification and climate change,” said Kim.
One of the season’s episodes will focus on Union Station’s displacement of original L.A. Chinatown residents and the subsequent creation of “New Chinatown.” Another will dive into current challenges faced by the L.A. Chinatown community, including anti-Asian hate and gentrification. The season will also cover the diversity of perspectives on what Chinatown represents, the horrific 1871 Chinese massacre and the story of Y.C. Hong.
“I hope people take away from [the season] the tension between a really long history of very violent and brutal racism against Asian and Chinese immigrants in the United States, but also the ongoing resiliency and efforts to create more racial equality and racial justice,” Kim said.
Li Wei Yang, the Huntington’s Pacific Rim Collections curator, said he believes “Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” also honors the advances fought for by Chinese Americans in the past, a legacy felt in current Chinese American experiences. 
“It is because of their fighting for civil rights, their fighting against exclusion and all these immigration restrictions that were put in place against the Chinese, especially in the 19th century — because of the fight against it by the Chinese American activists — that we’re able to enjoy the freedom and the rights that we have today,” Yang said.
“Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” is produced by Avishay Artsy, Katie Dunham, Elizabeth A. Logan, Olivia Ramirez, Stephanie Yi, Hise, Kim and Yang. Deverell, who also hosted the first season of “Western Edition,” will return as host. 
“Western Edition: L.A. Chinatown” will be available on several audio streaming platforms including Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Episodes will be released weekly on Tuesday.

When alumna Sunnie Wang reflects on her undergraduate journey, she finds that clichés ring more true as she gets older. Wang, a 2022 graduate who majored in law, history and culture, occupied herself with an internship and job every semester of college because she felt swept up in the hustling current of her peers’ ambitions, she said. 
Wang said evaluating the worth of a job, organization or decision yourself holds a multitude of possibilities, but it must be an individual decision made by “trust[ing] your gut.” Her advice to current students is to live in the moment and discern early on what’s fundamentally important to them as individuals. 
“None of [the jobs and internships] mean anything, unless you actually gain anything from it … I would sit down and be like, ‘What did I even do?’” Wang said. “What you’re putting your energy into is worth it can mean a myriad of things — worth it in the moment or worth it in the long run — that’s up for you to decide.”
Looking back, 2022 graduate Katie O’Hara said college life is like a “self-contained fire.” College is a unique environment where you have your work in front of you and your friends all around you, O’Hara said, and you are living in a “little world that kind of fits together perfectly.” In thinking about the future, O’Hara, who majored in psychology, said she felt nervous but ultimately excited about her postgraduate life.
Advice which O’Hara said she hopes undergraduates will heed is to take advantage of opportunities, avidly participate in class, attend office hours more often and reach out to more people. 
“Do it now and do it earlier, and just put yourself out there and reach out to people,” O’Hara said. “I wish I asked more questions and went to more office hours because I was always scared of seeming like I didn’t know what was going on, or like I didn’t have friends, or like I didn’t know the answer. And I realized, no one did.”
O’Hara said being afraid of the way in which one is perceived by others will serve as an inhibition from reaching one’s full potential in college.
“Just put yourself out there and reach out to people, and don’t be scared of seeming like you are putting in more or like you’re chasing something or someone,” O’Hara said. “Everyone already feels like that at first … you kind of fake it till you make it.” 
Mason Burns, a 2022 graduate who majored in accounting, said graduating and being a first-generation professional in his family has left him with uncertainties and unanswered questions about the transition from being a student to entering the workforce. Finding the resources and mentors necessary to assimilate into the workplace is difficult to navigate, Burns said, but can be found through connecting to others in similar situations.
“I’ve been scared to be able to ask anyone in my family questions about certain things about the workplace … [such as] what is proper workplace etiquette, how do you negotiate your salary, how do you set work-life balance,” Burns said. “I’ve just been trying to find other first-generation white collar kids … who I’m comfortable with to ask these questions.”
Taking a gap year is a decision that shouldn’t be influenced by one’s peers or parents, but rather by seeing how it fits into your life plans, Burns said, but there’s no blanket solution. In his own deliberations about attending law school, Burns concluded that a gap year after college will not make a significant difference to him in the long run. 
 “I think at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter if you practice law for 40 years, 39 years, 38 years. When you’re 65, it’s not gonna matter how long you practiced law,’’ Burns said. 
It’s best to research, Burns said, and formulate your own opinion about taking a gap year. He contended that he disagreed with the “conventional wisdom” that mandated everyone to take a gap year to figure themselves out.
“Just do what’s best for you,” Burns said. “If you feel like you want some real world experience … and you want to get some money, then take a gap year, but if you feel like you can get into a good school and go straight through, then that’s also a really good thing to do.”
O’Hara is considering taking a gap year because, having lived at home for a lot of her undergraduate time on account of the pandemic, she said she wants more time to explore and figure out her goals and desires. Going to graduate school is a clear next step and can be comforting, O’Hara said, but she wants to take the time to explore her options. 
“The way that I look at it is, after you graduate college, everything you’re doing is for you. You’re just competing against yourself, you’re not competing against people in your class,” O’Hara said, “I’ve been thinking a lot about … [whether] I want to go right back into school right now … or what do I want, and I’m realizing just by asking those questions, I feel like I need to take time and figure it out.”
Anna Rhee, a rising senior majoring in law, history and culture with one semester of college left, said she’ll use her final time at USC as an unorthodox gap year. A sum of her anxiety, Rhee said, stems from finding a job because of the stereotypes surrounding the difficulty of graduating with a degree in humanities. Knowing that more technical majors, such as engineering or business, are more likely to have definite, “pipeline” jobs after college, Rhee said, has given her anxiety about joining the workforce.
“I’m looking forward to making some real money and just getting out there and getting real world experience,” Rhee said. “Internships and jobs during college helped a lot to shape what I wanted to do but actually getting out there, being paid for my work and being able to give back to my parents in that way will be pretty cool.”

Content warning: This article contains references to gender and power-based violence. 
The USC Campus Coordinated Response Team developed a guidebook on trauma-informed, culturally sensitive and inclusive teaching practices for LGBTQIA+ students at the University. The team was led by co-principal investigators Brenda Ingram, director of Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services at USC Student Health, and associate professor of clinical preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and Mellissa Withers, director of the Global Health Program of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. Students, professors and staff from offices including RSVP and the LGBTQ+ Student Center were included in the writing and editing process.
The guidebook seeks to help faculty members and teaching assistants create safe and inclusive learning environments for LGBTQIA+ students, as well as help support students who have been victims of gender and power-based harm, said RSVP assistant director Debbie Schleicher. The document offers guidelines for classroom introductions and LGBTQIA+ inclusive teaching practices, among other resources.
“We want to make sure that [faculty members and TAs] on campus feel well-equipped to respond to survivors and are well-equipped to make sure that their classrooms are not engaging in any harm,” Schleicher said. 
Recently published on the Center for Excellence in Teaching at USC website, the guidebook was created over the past year and a half. One of the challenges the creators faced was deciding what to include, since the topic was broad but the document had to be digestible, Withers said. The final decisions of what to include were made after various editing rounds and discussions.
Journey Rahman, a rising senior majoring in human biology, participated in the editing process. They had an initial interview with Withers in which they discussed sexual violence in LGBTQIA+ relationships. As part of the student focus group, they made edits to the guidebook and discussed their edits with one another, Rahman said.
“I liked that [the CCRT] was acknowledging the fact that LGBTQ people are the best sources for information on our experiences,” Rahman said. “It was really good to feel valued as a member of the community and to also see and work with other LGBTQ leaders on campus.”
While faculty can already access the guidebook online, the CCRT will promote it in the time leading up to the fall 2022 semester and will lead a series of webinars. The webinars, which will be recorded, will highlight important aspects of the guidebook for faculty members that do not have time to read the whole document, Schleicher said.
“We would love ideally for everyone to [read the guidebook or attend a webinar], but we also want to make it digestible and easy for people to take away the key components of it,” Schleicher said. 
A lot of the data the guidebook uses comes from the 2019 AAU Campus Climate on Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey, as well as the 2020 USC Student Wellbeing Survey. To maintain the relevance and accuracy of the guidebook, topics including resources and terminology will be updated at least annually following the collection of new data from these studies, Schleicher said. 
The collaborative nature of the process and the input of everyone involved were integral to the success of the project, Withers said. She enjoyed hearing about the participants’ desire for the guidebook and its expected impact on faculty training. 
“Small changes or changes that aren’t going to be difficult to implement can really matter a lot to our LGBTQ student population,” Withers said.
If faculty or teaching assistants observe someone persistently misgendering a student after being made aware of their pronouns, they should report it to the Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX as designated employees.

Fashion and art are best compared to fruit: They can originate from the same tree but often fall down different paths. But, as they come from the same tree, they have moments in which their common makeup surfaces. 
In art, fashion is often brought up, especially through themes of vanity or animal abuse — such as David Hammons and his graffitied fur coats display. The reverse is just as true, as fashion constantly pays homage to great artists, like Jeremy Scott’s Moschino Spring 2020 Picasso-inspired collection. 
However, fashion can also incorporate aspects of performance art. One famous example of this is Alexander McQueen’s robots spraying model Shalom Harlow with paint in his 1999 Spring RTW collection. Another is Issey Miyake’s Spring 2020 RTW show, where her dresses were floated down by a pulley only to be slipped onto and pulled down models who then bounced and danced around the runway space.
On the fashion tree, the makeup and beauty industry falls quite far from its other siblings. If makeup weren’t so influential, it wouldn’t be a huge marketplace for businesses like Sephora and publications like Allure and Byrdie. Additionally, if beauty was supposed to be separate from fashion and its industry, then there wouldn’t be hundreds of makeup artists and specialists backstage, and Vogue would not have its iconic “Beauty Secrets” series (that I secretly and shamelessly perform as I prep in the morning). 
So, then, can makeup also be considered performance art on the same plane as fashion? 
One TikToker, Instagrammer and artist who uses makeup as an art medium is Las Vegas-based Madrona Redhawk, known online as @madroni_redclock. Often playing with different mediums such as forks or plates to create her looks, ranging from avant-garde to everyday styles, her work has amassed a massive following and features in Samsung’s Galaxy A commercials. However, her videos and photos range from applying makeup through odd mediums, performance art and different intricate looks.
Her emphasis on makeup, while primarily exploratory and fun, also sheds light on what makeup can mean. It can be as simple as enhancing certain physical features, but, for others, it can be a form of self-expression and accessorization. Additionally, for certain industries, it can amplify a more prominent subject, such as Prada’s minimalistic makeup to accompany Raf Simons’ recent vision, or the usage of eye makeup in HBO’s hit show “Euphoria” which changes and reflects the character’s development. 
But, just like any art form, what can add a lot of pressure to makeup and beauty in everyday life is the quality of “good” versus “bad.” I know firsthand how embarrassing and even shameful it can feel when someone criticizes your makeup skills, especially when you’re in public or if you’ve spent a lot of time on it. With the craze of effortless “natural” beauty inspired by celebrities such as Devon Lee Carlson and Bella Hadid, it seems that more is more, yet less is more too. So, if art can be subjective, why can’t makeup be as well? 
I guess this just becomes cyclical then, asking what exactly defines art and performance art. Does there have to be an underlying meaning behind an artist’s choices, or can it still be artistic if it is just an expression of one’s emotions?
In a confusing world often consisting of chasing and following others, why not pioneer a route for yourself (even if it has been done before). Come on, now — it’s hot girl summer again! Follow your gut, be intuitive and live out your best, most expressive and explorative summer yet.

As a majority of USC students begin to spend their summer breaks in or around Los Angeles, what better way to attract some inspiration on how to spend our free time around town than with movies? Here are just a few fun ones for each of the city’s different facets: from hipsters and influencers, to hustlers and cynics. 
“Ingrid Goes West” (2017) 
If you, too, are horrified by the effects of influencer culture in L.A., this one’s for you. This social media satire starring Elizabeth Olsen and Aubrey Plaza displays the hazardous dangers of today’s online culture, as Ingrid (Plaza) does everything in her power to emulate her favorite influencer (Olsen). The majority of the film’s color palette feels like you’re watching one big Instagram post, displaying sunny L.A. through the lens of an aspiring content creator — that is, until the plot takes a dark turn.
“Licorice Pizza” (2021) 
While Paul Thomas Anderson’s filmography contains a plethora of movies revolving around L.A. and the San Fernando Valley (“Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia,” etc.), this one was the perfect, average summer movie. Following the activities and business ventures of an aspiring teenage actor, his controversially older partner-in-crime and his group of friends, “Licorice Pizza” doesn’t rely on crazy plot points to depict a hot Californian summer in the middle of the 1973 oil crisis. The interactions between characters and their ambitions make this movie feel more like an authentic summer film than the rest of this list. 
“Dope” (2015)
OK, so (technically) this one shouldn’t count because the main protagonists are still in school, but this feels like a summer coming-of-age story, so it’s staying on the list. Three friends navigating their senior year and Inglewood alike are met with a series of adventures throughout L.A., discovering mayhem and corruption at every corner. Come for the sporadic A$AP Rocky cameos, stay for the soundtrack. 
“The Runaways” (2010)
If you’ve been feeling the “rockstar’s girlfriend” aesthetic, this one’s for you. This biopic recounts the beginnings of Joan Jett and Cherie Currie’s infamous girl band “The Runaways” and all of the drama that entails. While this movie also features a stellar soundtrack, it’s arguably the fashion choices of the rockers that make the film great. 
“Under the Silver Lake” (2018) 
From A24, starring Andrew Garfield, this movie is definitely the most interesting one on this list. “Under the Silver Lake” is the more pretentious, older sister of 2015’s “Paper Towns.” When a neighbor in Garfield’s character’s apartment complex suddenly goes missing, he takes it upon himself to find her, giving an in-depth tour of the City of Angels, from The Last Bookstore to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. This movie gets extra points for the multiple Spider-Man references sprinkled throughout the runtime. 
“The Nice Guys” (2016) 
Set in 1977, two men (Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe) investigate a young girl’s disappearance and a string of murders revolving around antipollution protests, the Department of Justice and the success of the adult film industry in the ’70s. This movie is somehow half-buddy comedy, half-mystery and fully a somewhat love letter to all the working parts that make L.A. nightlife so interesting. 
“Mid90s” (2018)
Skateboarding, the ’90s, Alexa Demie — what else could you want in a movie? Jonah Hill’s directorial debut chronicles the nostalgia and phlegmatic nature of long summer days revolving around a 13-year-old boy named Stevie and a group of older skateboarders he idolizes in L.A. Kick back and travel back in time with this film. 
“(500) Days of Summer” (2009) 
Duh. This wouldn’t be a “Summer in L.A.” movie list without this one. Tom and Summer meet at their greeting card job downtown and grow closer together as they date in the city. Miscommunication, misconceptions and assumptions plague their time together, as the narrative showcases just how unreliable happy memories of past relationships can be. This is perhaps the most essential watch on this list if you’re dating in L.A. this summer break. 
Hopefully at least one of these wins you over. Either way, here’s to a summerlong movie binge!

For the past two years, many celebrations occurred virtually, including graduation, Christmas and most notably, Pride, one of the biggest in-person parades every year. With the coronavirus pandemic came challenges and isolation, but luckily, many celebrations are returning to an in-person format this year, including Los Angeles Pride. 
As one of the world’s biggest cities, L.A. is known for hosting suitably large parades, including its annual Pride Parade & Festival. This year’s celebration will feature multiple events leading up to the main ceremony on June 12. Here are three Pride events happening near you hosted by LA Pride.
LGBTQ+ Pride Night at Dodger Stadium 
As the kickoff event, the annual LGBTQ+ Pride Night at Dodger Stadium promises pregame parties, a good ball game and fun postgame fireworks on June 3. The pregame party starts at the Right Field Plaza Bar from 5:30 p.m. until the opening pitch at 7:10 p.m. The Dodgers will also recognize the first openly gay MLB player, former Dodger Glenn Burke, and offer special game jerseys that feature the Pride flag.
The national anthem will be sung by international queer artist Wils, and the night will feature other special guests like Billy Beane, also a former Dodger and the only other MLB player to come out publicly, and Dale Scott, a long-time MLB umpire who came out in 2014.
Tickets can be found on the LA Pride website, with a special group package for those celebrating with friends.
LA Pride in the Park 
On June 11 at the Los Angeles State Historic Park, LA Pride in the Park is sure to be an eventful night. Set to take place from 1 to 11 p.m., LA Pride has announced a stellar billing of performances, featuring headliners Christina Aguilera and Anitta alongside excellent artists like Syd and Chika.
The in-person festival will include activities, music, vendors, booths, food and drink and, for people over 21, a beer garden. The capacity for the event is set at over 25,000, and LA Pride anticipates the night becoming one of the best pride events to happen this year. Tickets can be found on the LA Pride website.
LA Pride Parade on Hollywood Boulevard 
Of course, no Pride celebration would be complete without attending the annual Pride Parade, set to kick off June 12 at 10:30 a.m. on the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Cahuenga Boulevard. According to LA Pride, L.A. held the world’s “first permitted gay parade in the world” in June 1970, but due to the coronavirus, the 50th anniversary Parade in 2020 was canceled. This year, the event is finally back.
With over 130 parade floats, the theme, #LoveYourPride, will inspire thousands and comprise a celebration for the books. The identity of the parade’s marshals and lineup are still being kept secret, but the free event will surely not disappoint.
These are just a few Pride events happening in L.A., but there are many more around the area and the country that you can participate in. Happy Pride!

In recent years, cops have been criticized more than they ever have been in America. As Black Lives Matter protests were held all over the country, systemic police brutality was brought to the forefront of the conversation. Movements to abolish the police have seen more support than ever.
But in the midst of all this, it is often asked where the Department of Public Safety fits in. Do they even count as police? Should they be abolished? The answer to both of these questions is yes.
While they may not appear to be, public safety officers, one of the two types of DPS officers, have trained at the Los Angeles Police Academy and share the same powers of arrest as LAPD officers. While possessing these powers, they do not have to comply with legislation that LAPD has to, such as the Racial and Identity Profiling Act.
But the LAPD ties don’t stop there. DPS is operated through a memorandum of understanding they have with LAPD. DPS has even had several controversies hiring those fired from LAPD, employing former officers who were fired for deeds like racial harassment (current USC lieutenant Peter Foster), false statements (current USC sergeant Frank Trevino), excessive force (current USC sergeant Steven Alegre), failure to diligently investigate a fellow officer (current USC sergeant Rodney Peacock) and more. 
DPS, like all police, should be abolished. While many call for reforms of this system, this simply is not enough. The damage that police have done cannot be undone by “different” policing, especially as policing was created as a system that upholds racism.
The modern-day police itself began as slave patrols that were formed to return runaway enslaved people to their owners and stop uprisings. Centuries of change and “reform” only have resulted in the continuation and expansion of this racism, such as their enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act and their internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
DPS, another result of reformations, stays true to its racist roots as it disproportionately targets Black and Latinx people. In 2019-2020, 31.7% of DPS stops involved Black people, a demographic that makes up 5.5% of the student body, 8.8% of staff, 3% of faculty and 12% of the people in the University Park area. In 2019, Alpha Phi Alpha, a Black fraternity, and Omega Phi Beta, a Latina sorority, had a tailgate surrounded by a fence and a swarm of DPS officers, while other tailgates did not. DPS does not make campus more safe; it only serves as an apparatus that profiles, arrests and polices people, making them less safe in the process.
DPS doesn’t “protect” USC’s campus — it encroaches upon the surrounding two-mile radius outside of campus, surveilling, patrolling and profiling local residents who, apart from their proximity, have no connection to our institution, with no say on their part. DPS has over 300 cameras on and off campus, tracking countless non-University-affiliated individuals 24/7.
Reform of DPS in particular has resulted in the most milquetoast of changes, such as the creation of the independent DPS Community Advisory Board. CAB oversees DPS but has no power to do anything in lieu of DPS abuse, rendering it about as useful as a pedestrian watching a high-speed car crash is. They can watch all they want, but that doesn’t change anything.
Simply put, police reform does not work, and example after example proves it. How can a system built to be violent toward people of color be reformed to serve these same people? It can’t.
DPS, which had a net operating budget of $48,890,000 in 2018-2019, was “one of the largest private campus public safety departments in the United States” according to its website. 
This obscene sum of money could be put toward community-based models that work toward actual safety and support, such as food, shelter and mental health resources that address the needs of those who would otherwise commit crimes out of desperation.
Scholar and activist Angela Davis, who wrote the essential abolitionist text “Are Prisons Obsolete?” (spoiler alert: her answer is yes), was invited by USC last June to to discuss “the various intersections of activism, feminism, prison abolition, politics, writing and more.” Davis also wrote an article aptly titled “California must lead the way in abolishing school and university campus police” in The Sacramento Bee.
Why bring Davis to talk about prison abolition if as an institution, USC won’t abolish DPS, an instrument of the carceral system Davis seeks to abolish? The only answer is that USC is performative — no, complicit — in the violence toward people of color.
Abolition is the only way forward. A new future cannot be built on an old, violently racist foundation such as our police system. DPS is a law enforcement department that trains at the LAPD Police Academy, holds the power of arrest that police hold and hires (failed) police officers. DPS and police in general must be replaced with real public safety that is in the best interest of not only USC and Trojans, but the surrounding community as well.

The United States inflation rate surged to a new four-decade high of 8.5% in March, a 40-year record that has only continued to rise. Purported causes are myriad: supply-chain issues persist, consumer demand soars — thanks to pandemic-era savings —and war in Ukraine rages on.
To borrow from Milton Friedman, “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” Essentially, inflation cannot occur without being a direct result of the central bank’s monetary policy. A country’s federal bank effectively acts as a stabilizer for its economy, harnessing enacted interest rates to control both unemployment and price levels. 
In reality, then, to analyze U.S. inflation, we both start and end with the actions of the Federal Reserve — commonly known as the “Fed.” Given that Americans live in a republic, it is crucial to understand the root causes of economic problems — a democracy’s strength depends on its populace’s knowledge. So what has the U.S. government done wrong?
The initial culprit for today’s mass inflation was most likely the trillions of dollars worth of stimulus checks distributed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury amid the recession during the pandemic. Of course, this relief was absolutely necessary after millions of Americans lost their jobs in 2020. 
A Pew Research Center survey found that as high as about one in four adults had trouble paying bills in the months following the onslaught of the pandemic. Yet the relief packages failed to prevent low-income Americans from bearing the brunt of the pandemic’s economic carnage regardless. With such a drastic increase in the money supply, the Fed needed to take more action to prevent an inevitable inflation. 
Under current chair Jerome Powell, the Fed has largely eschewed tight-money policies, until now. Tight monetary policy refers to the policy that “cools down” an overheated economy, using high interest rates to minorly reduce economic growth but ultimately stabilize price increases. 
For the first time since 2018, the federal funds rate was increased two months ago. Having been near zero prior, the interest rate is now in a range between 0.25% and 0.5%, with plans for it to be gradually increased to roughly 2% by the end of 2022. For frame of reference, an interest rate of near 0% is an example of easy monetary policy, meaning it cultivates economic expansion but fails to regulate prices. Powell begrudgingly conceded that the believed narrative of supply chain improvements soon cooling inflation has “already fallen apart.” 
But many critics feel this response to what was called “transitory” inflation is long overdue. With interest rates now set to face a steady series of increases, economic growth will be hindered. Now, recession feels imminent to many Americans. How worried should we be? 
Perhaps the most apt comparison to make comes from the last time inflation was this high: 1982, during Ronald Reagan’s first term as president. After the 1970s were marred by stagflation — a term referring to when slowed economic growth, high unemployment and a high inflation rate all coincide — Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker as Chair of the Federal Reserve. As inflation persisted through 1981, pressure on both the Reagan administration and the Fed mounted. Volker took drastic action, with interest rates eventually reaching as high as almost 20%. 
The U.S. economy went into recession, but by the end of 1982, inflation was below 5%. The economy proceeded to enjoy a prosperous expansion lasting into 1990. Could a similar fairy tale ending be in the cards for Biden, Powell and the U.S.?
The short answer is no; the long answer is even darker. Even if we avoid a recession, the U.S. economy currently faces problems so deeply entrenched that there isn’t any truly happy ending in sight. U.S. national debt recently topped $30 trillion, over 140% of the size of our total economy. 
Income inequality continues to skyrocket. Even before the pandemic, the richest quintile of households already made over 50% of the country’s total income. This problem has since only been exacerbated further: between Q4 2019 and Q1 2021, the net worth of the country’s 1% went up 23.1%, while the net worth of the country’s bottom 20% earners only went up 2.5%. 
Even with a properly executed response to a recession, there are many Americans who would still endure disastrous and lasting consequences — for example, university students who will be entering the job market for the first time.
