A former USC student has filed a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department for their handling of his rape case. The case was no longer pursued by the L.A. County district attorney’s office. 
Armaan Premjee, the former student, alleges civil rights violations, malicious prosecution, negligence and false imprisonment by the city and LAPD. Police Chief Charlie Beck and two LAPD detectives were named as defendants in the case. 
Vicki Sarmiento, Premjee’s civil rights attorney, said Premjee should have never been arrested nor prosecuted, claiming that the police department violated federal and state law.
“There was a rush to arrest him and once you arrest someone with that kind of charge you’re already putting that person in a bad light,” Sarmiento said. “It’s a heinous crime to be charged with.”
In March, USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity found Premjee responsible for policy violations after conducting its own investigation into the sexual assault charges. Premjee was later expelled from USC, according to Sarmiento and the brief.
USC was not mentioned as a defendant in this suit.
In May 2017, Premjee pleaded not guilty to a count of rape by use of drugs and a count of sexual penetration with a foreign object, after an alleged incident with a fellow student on campus. In July, the district attorney’s office decided to not continue pursuing a criminal case against Premjee after a judge ruled that he would not be held to answer.
“There is no indication of any withdrawal of consent,” the judge wrote in his ruling.
In the brief, Premjee claims that LAPD detectives Oscar Gamino and Carla Zuniga, acted “with a deliberate indifference to or reckless disregard for an accused’s rights for the truth in withholding evidence from prosecutors” and “suppressed exculpatory evidence.”
In addition, Premjee claims that the detectives withheld video evidence showing the alleged victim’s intent to pursue sexual relations with him, and that they failed to show this footage to witnesses during questioning.
“They had the video camera footage from the very start,” Premjee said. “They suppressed evidence that could have basically changed my life.”
The lawsuit also claims that Gamino and Zuniga “improperly influenced” the alleged victim and her roommates through “suggestive questioning.” The alleged victim’s roommates served as witnesses in the case.
In March, the alleged victim said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that she “couldn’t have possibly gave consent,” and that she did not pursue criminal charges against Premjee. 
The lawsuit states that Premjee now faces humiliation and that he has “suffered greatly from the being unable to pursue his academic studies and the stigma of an unsubstantiated rape charge.”
“My professional life will definitely be impacted for the rest of my life,” Premjee said. 
The LAPD declined to comment. The Los Angeles City Attorney’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. USC’s Office of the Registrar did not immediately confirm Premjee’s status at the University.

Nearly 30 students gathered at the USC Engemann Student Health Center to protest former USC gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged abuse of patients and the University’s lack of transparency on Saturday. 
Ariel Sobel and Viva Symanski founded Justice for Trojans, a group created to help women who say they were assaulted or harassed by Tyndall.
Last month, the Los Angeles Times reported that Tyndall had a history of sexual misconduct allegations dating back to the 1990s. Over 400 women have accused Tyndall of committing misconduct under the pretense of medical treatment and making inappropriate comments. In light of numerous petitions from USC students, professors and alumni criticizing the handling of these allegations, USC President C. L. Max Nikias agreed to step down late last month. 
“These are crimes going on . . . and it speaks to rape culture because it was taken less seriously,” Sobel said.  “If George Tyndall was burning fires . . . people would have stopped it. But somehow the extreme violence that was going on was ignored.”
Marching from the health center to Tommy Trojan, students chanted phrases like, “What to do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”
Project Consent, an awareness and advocacy group for victims of sexual assault, sponsored the event. Speakers included Sobel and Symanski, representatives of Planned Parenthood and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention, USC sophomore Hailey Robertson and Gloria Allred, the attorney representing 24 women — including Symaski — in a lawsuit against Tyndall and the University.
“A lot of young women don’t get the proper sex [education] in high school, and our bodies are treated as kind of taboo,” Robertson said. “So it’s really important to convey . . . your body’s not taboo, here’s what’s supposed to happen in the doctor’s room.”
The event  made several demands for the University, including an investigation of everyone complicit in Tyndall’s alleged acts,  improved access to legal services for sexual abuse victims and education on what students should expect during a gynecologist visit.
Speakers addressed the specific targeting of international students and non-native English speakers was addressed.  According to the Times, Tyndall reportedly made inappropriate comments to Asian and Middle Eastern students about their sexualities in relation to their cultures.
“[Tyndall] had this perception that [international students and non-native English speakers] were more vulnerable, that they wouldn’t fight back,” Robertson said. “We need to combat that perception first and foremost.”
According to Sobel, Tyndall also made inappropriate comments toward gay and bisexual women, including Sobel herself. 
“He made comments that everyone should be on birth control, even the lesbians,” Sobel said. “Every women I know who’s made contact with him, who’s queer, he made a lot of probing questions about your relationships with women.”
 The speakers also discussed the difficulty Tyndall’s alleged victims encountered in their attempt to seek justice.  Allred, Robertson and Sobel questioned the objectivity of the internal investigation USC’s Office of Equity and Diversty conducted in regards to Tyndall, noting that many law firms were independently advertising their services on social media. According to the speakers, these posts could potentially confuse and re-traumatize the victims of the alleged abuse. 
 According to Allred, another twenty women had joined the class action suit against the University since it was first filed. She provided information about how other victims could come forward anonymously. 
“To these young women: you are USC,” Allred said. “And that’s why we say they have a duty to protect you. We will not stop until justice is done.”
Ending the event, multiple speakers spoke of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements against sexual harassment and assault of women, implying that survivors would no longer allow abuse to continue to be swept under the rug. 
“Culturally, in USC, among other institutions, … we don’t know the rules [of consent] yet,” USC alumna and march attendee Derl Clausen said. “Even though we’ve attempted to define them, it seems like that is not fixing an underlying issue.”

USC School of Religion assistant professor Rongdao Lai hosted the Conference on Buddhist Ethics  from June 8 to 10. The conference featured 34 scholars who discussed the application of Buddhist principles to important social issues. 
Thirty-four scholars at the Conference on Buddhist Ethics discussed race, class and resistance in relation to religion. USC professor Rongdai Lao organized the weekend-long event. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
The event was sponsored by Tong Fa Temple and Malton Group, and was co-sponsored by the USC School of Religion, Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religion and Culture, USC East Asian Religion Studies Center and the Center for International Studies at USC. 
“In conceiving this conference, we were thinking that we really wanted to invite people working in different disciplines, covering different geographic areas and working on different time periods,” Lai said. “We have scholars from as far as Japan, U.K. and quite a few from Canada. I’m excited to welcome everyone to USC.”
According to Lai, the conference comes after the first Conference on Buddhist Ethics at Dickinson College in 2016. Attendees were invited by the event organizers and were chosen based on their area of study.
“We really wanted to invite people who worked in different disciplines,” Lai said. “We have an even number of male and female scholars. We have a balanced number of people in different stages of their career, so we have senior scholars in the field, [and] we also have young scholars early in their career.”
Lai focused this year’s conference on discussing race, class and resistance in the context of Buddhism, to help nurture a healthy community and to promote Buddhist ethics. 
“In the planning process, we decided that we would be focusing on the issues of class, race and resistance,” Lai said. “We wanted to make sure to look at this from the doctrinal, historical, anthropological kind of perspective, in different parts of the world as well.”
Multiple sessions took place over the course of the weekend. For the first 15 minutes of each session, the topic of the seminar was introduced. This was followed by a 40-minute session where participants were assigned to small discussion groups. Toward the end, the small groups convened for a general 30-minute session to discuss their thoughts. 
“In terms of conference format, I think this is very innovative because we decided that no one is going to be presenting papers,” Lai said. “We organized the conference more in the format of a workshop, so we appointed discussion leaders to set context and select certain sources that could be helpful in developing discussion arguments. 
On June 8, the conference consisted of two sessions. The first session, which discussed Buddhism and class, was facilitated by University of Central Florida professor Ann Gleig and University of British Columbia professor Jessica Main. USC professor Duncan Williams and Youngstown State University professor Michael Jerryson facilitated the second session.
During her session, Gleig proposed a three-part definition for a class and its relation to religious students. She provided metaphorical models which implemented a loose framework for examining Buddhist class structures. According to Gleig, there are multiple models that can be used by scholars to shape an argument about class and religious studies.
“You got the pyramid in which you got the smaller leader and much larger lower class and limited opportunities for movement and a lot of regulation on all areas of life,” Gleig said. “The binary model is something we are more familiar with, you know Marxist models where there is tension between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie.”
On June 9, Harvard University professor Chris Queen and Bucknell University professor James Shields facilitated a session on right speech and social change. Following the seminar, the scholars visited the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo.
By the end of the  weekend-long event, the scholars gained knowledge of various aspects of Buddhism from other professors, as well as different perspectives that western and eastern countries had on the religion. 
“We tried to create this platform and community where people can be willing to trust scholars who make studying Buddhism their living to talk about important issues,” Lai said. “Engagement and being involved is a very important part of the conference for me, so the very success of the conference depends on participation from all and not the findings of one of two individuals.”

Murray Fromson, a professor emeritus and former director of the School of Journalism, passed away in his sleep on June 9 after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. He was 88. 
Murray Fromson joined the University in 1982, and served as the director of the School of Journalism from 1994 to 1999. Photo from USC News.
Fromson founded and directed the Center for International Journalism after joining the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 1982. The center was known for helping journalists, who were earning master’s degrees, to specialize in reporting on Mexico and Cuba. Fromson eventually became the director of the School of Journalism in 1994. 
“The people whom he taught through the Center for International Journalism which he created at USC have gone on to become leaders of the profession around the world,” former Annenberg dean Geoffrey Cowan wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “With his background in both print and broadcast and in both domestic and international reporting, he was able to build on the school’s excellence and to make a meaningful contribution to the whole university.”
Prior to joining USC, Fromson had 35 years of experience as a journalist. Fromson reported for both the Associated Press and CBS News during major historical events, such as the Korean and Vietnam wars.
Fromson is best known for his  reporting of the U.S. occupation in Japan, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, armistice talks in Korea and three summit meetings between Richard Nixon.
Fromson and his CBS colleagues were honored with two Overseas Press Club awards for the reportings of the fall of Saigon in 1975, 
“Murray had a passion for journalism — what it could mean in the world and how to make sure that it adheres to its highest values,” Cowan said. “Having seen and been part of its role when the press covered the war in Vietnam and the civil rights movement in Selma, for example, he understood and conveyed the importance of reports that tell a great story well while bearing witness.”
In 1978, Fromson served as California Governor Edmund G. Brown’s deputy campaign manager and eventually became the consultant to the president of the University of California Systemwide Administration. Fromson was also a moderator for the television program California Week in Review and produced Eric Sevareid’s Chronicle.
Fromson is survived by his wife Dodi, daughter Aliza Ben Tal and son Derek Fromson. 
A memorial service has yet to be announced.

Rating: 2.5/4 stars
Months earlier, Cate Blanchett, who plays Lou in “Ocean’s 8,” stood among 81 other women on the steps of the Palais at the Cannes Film Festival, protesting gender inequality in the industry. 
“We demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so that they can best reflect the world in which we actually live,” Blanchett proudly said in her speech. 
Directed by Gary Ross, “Ocean’s 8” is the embodiment of the emerging women’s movement in Hollywood. Despite its exciting political shine, however, the film seems to drag its actresses through tired plot points, thus dulling the project’s overall gleam. 
Similar to “Ocean’s Thirteen,” the latest installment of the “Ocean’s” series opens with Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) taking a final bow after her five-year prison sentence. “I’m just looking forward to the simple life,” she says. 
Lou soon reunites with Debbie, and the pair put together their entourage for a jewelry heist. In an enjoyable montage, viewers are introduced to Nine Ball (Rihanna), an expert hacker; Constance (Awkwafina), a central park pickpocket; Amita (Mindy Kaling), a jewelry maker; Tammy (Sarah Paulson),  a suburban housewife and profiteer; and Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter), a fashion designer.
The centerpiece of the heist, however, is actress Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), who must wear the Toussaint — a $150 million Cartier necklace — to the Met Gala.
“Ocean’s 8,” the all-female spinoff of the “Ocean’s” trilogy, earned a record-setting $41.5 million in its opening weekend. (Photo from IMDb).
Though “Ocean’s 8” makes no mistake in relishing its pro-female statement, the film has all the underpinnings of the traditional chick flick. At times, this quality is endearing — for instance, when Constance teaches Amita how to use dating apps. Often, it evokes a slight wince, as when Anne Hathaway’s character rolls her eyes to say she “just doesn’t have that many female friends!” 
However, the movie teeters on galling in its revenge subplot involving Debbie’s former love interest: one of the first things she does upon being released from prison is attend his gallery opening, threatening a skeevy Richard Armitage with a DIY knife. “Closure,” she shrugs. Yet, a threat of violence isn’t enough for Debbie: her five years in prison weren’t just for planning a dazzling heist, it was also about punishing an ex-lover. She seamlessly pins the crime on Armitage’s character, Claude Becker, arousing from the audience an echo of Cate Blanchett’s reaction in the film: “You don’t plan a job within a job!” 
The revenge plot feels cheap and unnecessary  — would Danny Ocean have revolved a heist around an ex? To worsen matters, the film hardly allows viewers the satisfaction of seeing Becker behind bars: Instead, we leave him asking for a lawyer in an interrogation room. 
Perhaps the film would have felt more satisfying if Armitage’s screen time was evenly distributed among the many talented actresses in the film. For the most part, “Ocean’s 8” reveres its already-established stars, Bullock, Blanchett and Hathaway, leaving the rest of the cast to play the predictable chorus. Though confined to short scenes and dialogue, Kaling, Awkwafina and Rihanna consistently shine through their comedic timing and portrayal of lovable characters. It is worth noting that the no one from the latter group — the ‘women of color’ group — was present at the Met Gala as guests. Rather, they played the help. 
This imbalance of representation among the women of color versus the film’s white actresses further denotes the subtle ways discrimination may crawl into what is touted as a movement of equality; it shows us that Hollywood still has a long way to go. A film like “Ocean’s 8” may mark a beginning, but hopefully more change will manifest before the industry promotes its next female-centered film.

Just one week after dropping “Ye,” Kanye West has returned with “Kids See Ghosts,” a seven-track collaboration with rapper Kid Cudi.  
Despite Cudi and West having a rather tempestuous relationship since Cudi signed with G.O.O.D Music in 2008, the pair put their differences aside to work on “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” on “The Life of Pablo.” That truce didn’t last long — Cudi publicly criticized West and other top artists for using a team of writers for their songs. But the release of “Kids See Ghosts” suggests that those differences have been set aside. 
Everything “Ye” failed to achieve, “Kids See Ghosts” accomplishes with flying colors. On “Ye,” West attempted to address his recent controversies with the media, but his focus on personal image superceded the creative production of the project. Many critics claimed the most successful song on “Ye,” “Ghost Town” is a step above the other six tracks because it was originally slated to be a part of “Kids See Ghosts,” but was shifted to “Ye” at the last minute — giving fans a sneak peak of the musical masterpiece to come. 
“Kids” addresses both artists’ struggles over the past several years. Cudi focuses on his battle with depression and suicidal thoughts, while West lyricizes his struggle with self-acceptance. Throughout the record, both artists complement each other as they come to terms with their identities. 
The album opens with “Feel the Love,” an experimental track that distinguishes itself from the rest of the tracks in structure and mood. It opens with a resounding and reverberating “I can still feel the love” from Cudi , these lyrics serve as the backbone of the song. Unexpectedly, the first and only verse in the song comes from Pusha T, who addresses how the three artists are no longer worried about others’ opinions, instead focusing on their own goals and paths to success. Following Pusha’s verse, West enters with a barrage of “Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat’s” and “Brrr-ah-da-da-da’s,” alluding to not only the vocals heard on “Lift Yourself,” but also preparing listeners for the ominous sound of the remaining songs on the album.
Kanye West and Kid Cudi complement each other on the record, each addressing their mental health struggles and supporting each other in an act of musical camraderie. (Photo courtesy of G.O.O.D Music).
“Reborn,” is tinged with a confessional, almost apologetic quality. Both West and Cudi take responsibility for their actions, promising to move forward  and acknowledging that change must start with them. Cudi’s chorus focuses on a sense of redemption: “I’m so- I’m so reborn, I’m movin’ forward/Keep movin’ forward, keep movin’ forward/Ain’t no stress on me Lord, I’m movin’ forward.” 
The chorus also touches on faith in God, a theme also present in the songs “Fire” and “Cudi Montage.” “It’s so many days I prayed to God/All this pain, I couldn’t seem to find a way,” Cudi raps on “Fire.” The song shows how Cudi has attempted to find peace through the power of Christ. West’s faith is most notable in “Cudi Montage,” in which Mr. Hudson, Cudi and West harmonize beautifully in the chorus, “Lord shine your light on me, save me, please/Stay strong.”
No Kanye West album would be complete without a slew of samples. “Kids See Ghosts” is tinged with both old and new influences, including Marcus Garvey, Kurt Cobain and Louis Prima. Prima, a mid-1900s New Orleans jazz artist, is featured “4th Dimension.” The song samples Prima’s “What Will Santa Claus Say (When He Finds Everybody Swingin’).” One of the more upbeat songs on the album, “4th Dimension”  expresses West’s view of his own musical contributions as a sort of gift to his listeners. 
The titular track combines a few of the themes of the album and brings back some themes from past songs in West’s verse. With a great flow of rhymes, West brings together the courage he built up for this album, his faith in God and how he has exceeded the expectations others had for him. He even refers to himself as “Mr. West,” a self-given nickname unheard for quite some time, implying that West is on the path to recovery. 
“Kids See Ghosts” rightfully trumps “Ye” by a long shot. The West and Cudi album is a complete and refined product that masters the art of collaboration. Both artists have endured mental health issues that have caused them to act out, turning the public against them, but the record can be held as an act of redemption, even recovery.
The introspective work seamlessly illustrates the artists’ respective struggles along with their journeys of self-discovery. Overall, “Kids See Ghosts”  successfully merges contrasting sounds and production, reasserting Kanye West’s musical aptitude.

Rating: 3.5/5 stars
Twenty-one-year-old British singer and songwriter Jorja Smith has been making waves in hip-hop, grime and R&B for the past several years without releasing an album. She collaborated with English rapper Stormzy, made an appearance on Drake’s “More Life,” had her music featured on HBO series “Insecure” and was featured on the Kendrick Lamar-curated “Black Panther” soundtrack. The past few years allowed Smith to be known for her artistry rather than her featured hits. Smith’s distinctive voice is apparent on her debut “Lost & Found,” which defines her position as an artist who has nowhere to go but up.
Smith has a husky voice, with, at times, overly nasally tones. Yet, she is able to balance and blend the genre of soul with jazz and R&B. Despite Smith’s delightful amalgamation of genres, the majority of the record feels too safe. The album doesn’t stray from the conventions of the aforementioned genres, resulting in a sound that is both pleasurable and tedious. However, this familiarity can also captivate listeners. 
Many of Smith’s lyrics explore situations that may seem tired or cliché. For instance, the heartfelt lyrics on “Teenage Fantasy” recount exactly that — a teenager fantasizing about being with someone they can’t have. “We all want a teenage fantasy,” she sings, “Want it when we can’t have it/When we got it we don’t seem to want it.”
British artist Jorja Smith released her debut album “Lost & Found” on June 8. The twelve-track record has been praised for its blend of the hip-hop, grime and R&B genres. (Photo courtesy of FAMM).
However, there are a few salvageable tracks on “Lost & Found.” “The One,” which she performed at this year’s Coachella, blends smooth jazz with the classic narrative of pushing away a lover. “Never had to wait for love/Always thought it’d come around,” she croons.
 “Lifeboats (Freestyle)” is another standout: Smith raps for nearly three minutes about economic inequality, with a chorus that pays homage to Kanye West’s “All Falls Down.” It’s one of the few moments on the album in which Smith ventures into political commentary, providing a refreshing break from the rest of her love ballads and break-up songs.
 On the album is also “Blue Lights,” the single credited with launching her solo career in 2016. In an interview with Pigeons & Planes, she said that when writing “Blue Lights” she had been studying postcolonial British society’s impact on grime music. To further her research, she began asking children and teenagers about what they thought of the police and discovered their ingrained distrust toward the U.K. justice system. Their stories served as the inspiration for “Blue Lights.” “[It’s] about [people] walking around with this guilty conscience, even though [they’ve] done [nothing] wrong,” Smith wrote on Genius. 
Another noteworthy track is “Tomorrow,” a piano ballad in which Smith sings about the difficulty of saying goodbye to someone who was once a source of support and solace. In the song, Smith realizes that she was the reason the person left. The track touches on a recurring theme of the album— that of self-knowledge and consequential growth. 
Smith’s self-reflective lyrics demonstrate her keen intuition and growing wisdom. Paired with her tendency to research the issues she addresses in her music, Smith embodies the youthful curiosity and precocious ponderings that drive today’s emerging music scene. In the process, she solidifies her place as a restless,  answer-seeking woman in today’s tumultuous world. 
“Lost & Found” is a testament to Jorja Smith’s ability to deliver a bonafide record as a solo artist. She shows off her songwriting prowess and soulful voice, developing the foundation of an up-and-coming career. With an audience that already spans across the pond, Jorja Smith is only getting ready for a long-lasting career as one of the most soulful songstresses of this generation.

The USC women’s track and field team made history in Eugene, Ore.,  last weekend, capturing the program’s first National Championship since 2001. 
The victory came down to a split second and an unthinkable comeback. To secure a win at the women’s NCAA Track & Field Outdoor Championships, USC needed to finish first in the 4x400m relay, the weekend’s final event. 
After trailing in the race early on, a bobbled exchange between seniors Deanna Hill and Kendall Ellis seemed to seal the Trojans’ fate in the last leg. However, Ellis came roaring back on the final stretch, much to the disbelief of the crowd and television announcers. Ellis closed a seemingly insurmountable gap, inching out a win by .07 seconds over Purdue. 
USC won the championship with 53 total points, besting Georgia, which had 52 and Stanford, which finished with 51. The triumph marks the Trojans’ 106th national championship. 
Social media was lit ablaze by Ellis’s heroic efforts during the final leg of the 4x400m relay. The ESPN show SportsCenter tweeted a video of the comeback with the hashtag “SCTopTen,” and it was retweeted over 25,000 times. Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant even replied to it with a simple tweet: 
“Will power.” 
For the team comprised of sophomore Kyra Constantine, sophomore Anna Cockrell, Hill and Ellis, their historic comeback marked the fourth-best relay time in USC track and field history.
In addition, redshirt sophomore Angie Annelus also returns to Los Angeles as an individual national champion. She placed first in the women’s 200m with a time of 22.76, providing USC with vital points for its late title push on Saturday. 
For Ellis, her contribution was not limited to her incredible efforts in the relay. She finished second in the 400m race, clocking at 50.19 seconds, both of which were school records for the NCAA championships. She was named a first-team All-American for the 400m.
USC’s 4x100m relay team also produced a positive result, finishing in third place. The team of Annelus, Ellis, Hill and freshman TeeTee Terry produced a time of 43.11 seconds, just behind hosts Oregon and LSU. 
In addition, Cockrell was runner-up in the women’s 400m hurdle with a time of 55.71. 
The men’s track and field team failed to capture a national title, but they did finish in fourth place with two individual national champions and one relay national championship. 
Sophomore Michael Norman won the 400m final at 43.61 seconds to best a loaded group of runners. The time set a new NCAA and NCAA finals record. 
Additionally, junior Raj Benjamin brought home a national title for the 400m hurdle, also setting a new college record with a time of 47.02. USC Track and Field Director Caryl Smith Gilbert was in awe of Norman and Benjamin’s record-shattering performances, which took place in spite of poor weather conditions during a rainy weekend in Oregon. 
“Rai (Benjamin) and Michael’s (Norman) performances were astronomical, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Smith Gilbert said. “You knew they came in here ready to run, I’ve been preaching all year that it would be raining in Oregon.  I loved the way the team settled in and just accepted whatever adversity that came its way today. That is what we have been working on — execution under all circumstances.” 
Later on Norman and Benjamin displayed their winning mentalities once again as they helped the 4x400m relay team win USC’s third men’s national championship. Benjamin, Norman, senior Ricky Morgan Jr. and freshman Zach Shinnick beat the previous NCAA record by .59 seconds en route to victory. Their success would foreshadow the Women of Troy’s success in the 4x400m relay just a day later.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
From the second the Vegas Golden Knights and the Washington Capitals entered the Stanley Cup Finals, it was destined to be a memorable series. 
The Western Conference presented its best team in the Vegas Golden Knights. A year ago, the Golden Knights barely existed. As an expansion team in the 2017-2018 season, they were heavily criticized by hockey fans claiming that the team would fail as an organization. “Las Vegas is not a hockey town,” said pessimistic hockey fans. However, a solid expansion draft landed players like goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, defenseman Jason Garrison and offensemen William Karlsson. These players, bolstered by the hockey expertise of head coach Gerard Gallant allowed for the Golden Knights to make a deep-run into the postseason.
On the other hand, the Washington Capitals represented the Eastern Conference in their second Stanley Cup Finals. Their first appearance came in 1997-98 in which they fell short of my Detroit Red Wings. The Caps franchise player Alexander Ovechkin has been with the organization since he first entered the NHL in 2005. Since then, he has been one of the most dominant and admired players in the league.
Growing up, Ovi was one of my hockey role models. My fascination with him spawned when I saw a video of Ovechkin scoring a goal from his back in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. When 99 percent of people thought the play was over, Ovechkin had other thoughts. The determination and perseverance he possesses are forces to be reckoned with.
As a neutral fan in this situation, I didn’t know which team I wanted to get behind. Do I root for the first-year Cinderella team in the Golden Knights or do I root for Ovechkin and the Capitals? I couldn’t find an answer to that question throughout the series. It wasn’t until after the Capitals bested the Golden Knights four-to-one that I had my answer. 
Following Game 5, Ovechkin was presented with the Conn Smythe Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs — a well deserved award. After receiving his MVP trophy, he was the first person to hoist the greatest trophy in professional sports, the Stanley Cup. As he lifted the 35-pound prize, Ovechkin let out one of the most triumphant screams I had ever heard. The only time he wasn’t screaming was when he was kissing the trophy. As he skated around the arena with the cup in hand, tears came to his eyes and fans of both teams cheered in celebration for Ovi. 
At that moment, the answer to my seemingly unsolvable question was obvious. I wanted Ovechkin to win. There are few athletes in the world of professional sports that can maintain the amount of perseverance and dedication Ovechkin has demonstrated throughout his career. Despite coming short of a championship in 12 consecutive seasons, the Capitals finished first place in their division seven times under Ovechkin. That is a frustrating statistic for a captain to swallow. Take the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example. They mount a dominant season, have high postseason expectations set on them, make a deep playoff run and they fail short. 
It always makes me smile to see NHL players celebrate with the Cup in their hometowns following the championship. There is something so pure about it. Walking around, living your daily life, lugging a 35-pound trophy. Every Cup winner does this; its a way to show off and remember your hard work and dedication. Throughout my years as a hockey fan, I have seen some outrageous pictures and videos with the cup, but nothing can top the media that came from Ovechkin’s tour. He had a full day with the Cup, performing a “keg stand” on the Cup and then jumping into a fountain. Ovi capped off the night by saying goodnight to the Cup and spending the night with Lord Stanley’s Cup right by his side.
An underdog story always makes me happy. Seeing a team come out of nowhere and steal a title is one of the most exciting moments in sports. But for me, a story of dedication and perseverance like Ovechkin’s will top an underdog story every time.

Great news struck the USC Baseball team on the second and third day of the 2018 MLB Draft when juniors Solomon Bates, Lars Nootbaar and Dillon Paulson were drafted. Bates and Nootbaar were called in the eighth round, while Paulson went in the 13th round. 
As the No. 226 overall draft pick, Solomon Bates went to the San Francisco Giants. Coming from Victorville, Calif., Bates sat out his freshman season and started twice as a sophomore, throwing 36 total innings. Halfway through this past season, Bates moved into the starting rotation from the bullpen and defined himself as their go-to Sunday starter, ending the season with a 3.14 ERA and 79 strikeouts. He was a crucial leader in their win over No. 2 Oregon State at the end of the season, pitching seven shutout innings.

Lars Nootbaar was drafted No. 243 by the St. Louis Cardinals. Hailing from El Segundo, Calif., Nootbaar played 33 games and started in 29 of those as a true freshman. He started in 54 games during his sophomore season, accumulating seven home runs and 33 runs and finishing as an All Pac-12 Honoree. He ended with 34 RBI, the second-best on the team. As a junior, Nootbaar continued to lead the team at first base and in all three outfield positions. This diverse player finished his collegiate career with a total of 14 home runs and 74 RBI in three years. He is the second player from USC to be selected by the Cardinals in the last three years, following the footsteps of Jeremy Martinez in 2016. 
Dillon Paulson will stay in Los Angeles as the No. 404 pick by the Dodgers. From Encinitas, Calif., he played the majority of his 40 games as a freshman at first base. Paulson remained consistent, appearing in 41 games as a sophomore. As a junior, he ended with 10 home runs, 41 RBI and a .993 fielding percentage. This first baseman also scored a team high 35 runs this past season, bringing his total runs scored to 55 in three years. Along with Bates, he received All Pac-12 Honorable Mentions for the 2018 season. 
With the addition of these three men, 333 MLB draft picks have now come from the USC baseball program. The Trojans also hold the college baseball record for the most players to compete in the MLB with 111 players. These juniors will continue to represent USC as they look to find success in the major leagues.

Nick Young, also known by his nickname, “Swaggy P,” won the 2018 NBA Championship with the Golden State Warriors after sweeping LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on June 3.

Coming from Cleveland High School in Los Angeles, Young was deemed a top-50 recruit entering USC in 2004, ranking as high as No. 7 in the nation in some polls. As a freshman, he averaged 11.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game. Young continued to improve those numbers over his next two years to average 17.5 points per game during the 2006-2007 season and rank second-best in the conference for scoring and 3-point percentage (44.0 percent). He was selected to the All Pac-10 First Team for both his sophomore and junior seasons for his leadership on the court and impressive numbers. 
In his junior year, the Trojans basketball team was a fifth seed in the NCAA tournament when it lost in the Sweet Sixteen under head coach Tim Floyd. Young led the team throughout the regular season alongside Taj Gibson and into the postseason tournament where they defeated powerhouse players like Kevin Durant with the University of Texas. 
After the 2006-2007 season, Young chose to forgo his senior season to enter the NBA Draft. He was selected in the first round as the 16th overall pick by the Washington Wizards. As a rookie, he played in 75 games and averaged 7.5 points and 1.5 rebounds per game. He shot 43.9 percent overall and 40.0 percent from behind the arc. In the following two seasons, Young continued to establish himself as a reliable shooter for the Wizards by ranking 16th in the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage during the 2009-2010 season. 
Young eventually earned his spot as a starter for the Wizards until he was traded in 2012 to play for the Los Angeles Clippers. Future teammate Javale McGee also left the Wizards at the same time, and would later reconnect for a championship in Northern California. 
On average, Young contributed 8.3 points per game in the Clippers’ 11 playoff games that season. In the 2012-2013 season, Young played for the Philadelphia 76ers, where he held a 41.3 field goal percentage and averaged 10.6 points per game. 
Young quickly returned home when he began playing for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2013. As a bench player, he averaged 18.8 points per game and even tallied two 40-point games. Those games ranked as the two highest scoring games for a bench player in the league that season. He continued to shine with the Lakers (and play with Kobe Bryant during his farewell tour) until Young finally earned his starting spot in the 2016-2017 season, averaging 13.2 points and 2.3 rebounds per game. 
Last summer, Young signed with the Warriors, where he would reunite with McGee and become teammates with his cousin, Kevon Looney, to win the NBA title. He averaged 7.3 points per game throughout the season and only 2.6 points per game in the playoffs. Young did, however, start in place of Stephen Curry through Game 2 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the New Orleans Pelicans while Curry recovered from injury. He helped the Warriors through the playoffs and into the finals, where they would win the title. 
Young is now the fifth USC alumnus to win an NBA Championship, placing himself in the company of greats like Bill Sharman and Paul Westphal.

Environmental activists have struggled with making politicians take climate change seriously for years. Because environmental protection is such a long-term and confusing issue, it is difficult for legislators to formulate policy on, and even more difficult to talk about on the campaign trail — saying that the planet isn’t going to get worse than it already is isn’t quite as exciting as talking about health care or infrastructure reform, which bring about direct, tangible benefits.
Art by Chan Ha Kim | Daily Trojan
But the one thing that has proven to convince politicians (other than locking them in a room and forcing them to watch “An Inconvenient Truth”) is money. That’s not an anti-politics quip — politicians and government agencies tend to base their decisions on the possible economic impact of climate change. Moreover, these economic impacts are calculated by environmental algorithms that are painfully in need of an update.
Policymakers rely on climate-economic models to estimate the monetary damage a change in global temperature would cause, and how much changes in environmental policy would cost.
Global climate models are essentially giant algorithms, like the ones used to predict weather, but on a much larger scale. They simulate the atmosphere, oceans, ice and land for the whole planet, and can run through various scenarios while also computing economic outputs. These models are typically run on tennis court-sized supercomputers and have enough code to fill 18,000 pages of printed text.
Yet, the models that governments tend to favor are flawed. Their projections of the economic impacts of climate change do not match up with the current state of physical science. For instance, physical scientists predict that a 6-degree Celsius rise in global temperature would cause the planet to be unlivable, causing forests to grow on the poles, deserts to form in Europe and ocean levels to wipe out coastal cities — not to mention kill off most species and launch the planet back into the Eocene age. In contrast, the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, a favored alternative, predicts that the same rise in temperature would only result in a 10 percent drop in global GDP.
It seems hard to believe that a change in climate that could cause mass migration, a global fight for resources and the obliteration of major cities would only dent the global economy by 10 percent. While that is an extreme example (if climate experts are successful, the world can corral its temperature rise around 3 degrees), it reveals the major pitfalls of using economic impact as a reliable metric for environmental policy. 
If tools are solely being used for cost-benefit analysis of climate policy, we are unlikely to ever convince politicians to take firm action against climate change. Where we may see a tropical hellscape to rival Jurassic Park, they might only see a modest decline in economic outcomes.
These models may not be built to make projections so grand, but as they are currently being used, they allow policymakers to remain blissfully ignorant about the true costs of climate change. Furthermore, they give credence to “lukewarmers” — people who do not deny that human activity is causing climate change, but insist that climate change would not affect the planet that much.
A new paper by former Environmental Protection Agency staffer and current Smith College professor Alexander Barron lays out some specific changes that could be made to the small group of climate models that set expectations and policy in the United States. Folks at the EPA would be wise to read it, even though they are currently too busy buying mattresses and Greek yogurt for Scott Pruitt. 
Barron advocates for an update of the technology cost data in the models, which does not account for the current success of renewable and electric energy sources due to the glacial pace of academic research. He also recommends adding factors for the global health costs of pollution and climate change, which are not currently included in any of the models. Even these two changes could close some of the blind spots in climate policy.
The faults of global climate models are prime examples of why policy change must come from all areas, including the very algorithms we use to evaluate climate change. Updating the tools that we use to estimate and prepare for climate change is a key step in convincing politicians that the earth as we know it is worth saving, even if it means sacrificing aspects of our current quality of life. Though policymakers should be convinced simply by the specter of global climate change, we live in a world that requires hard evidence in dollars and cents; therefore, we must also tackle the issue from that end through a reform of climate-economic models.

Last week, Santa Clara County voters elected to recall county Judge Aaron Persky, who is best known for his sentence of a male college student to just six months in jail for sexual assault in 2016. That student was Brock Turner, whose high-profile case drew national attention, including recognition from politicians across the United States.
The bulk of Turner’s case took place in early 2016. It was a trial rife with victim-blaming interrogation, including humiliating inquiry about his victim’s diet and weight; outrage over Persky’s preposterous reason for giving Turner such a short sentence (he was concerned a longer sentence would have “severe impact” on Turner, as if Turner’s assault of an unconscious woman did not have “severe impact” on her); and then, suddenly, it was all over. Turner served only half his sentence before walking out a free man. His story — a harrowing commentary on racist double standards and societal trivialization of sexual assault — seemed to fade from our national consciousness. 
But as we learned last Tuesday, just because we weren’t paying attention, didn’t mean nothing was happening. One Stanford University professor spent the past two years organizing and leading a mass effort to recall Persky. Her work alongside a coalition of survivors and allies is a true testament to the staying power of the broader #MeToo movement, especially on college campuses, and its dynamic ability to catalyze change in every sphere of society.
#MeToo first emerged late last year in response to the systemic sexism and abuse that has disenfranchised women across many industries and walks of life. If anyone were seeking evidence more tangible than a viral hashtag, they need look no further than the efforts of Stanford law professor Michele Dauber. 
Even if her campaign had not resulted in a 59 percent vote in favor of recall, it nonetheless accorded sexual assault survivors in her community a voice and means to take action. According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, more than 90 percent of survivors of campus sexual assault do not report their experiences to authorities. Experts say that many choose not to come forward due to fear of blame and intimidation. 
And as Judge Persky’s decision reveals, rape culture is about more than blaming or disbelieving women. It’s also about neglecting to take women’s pain and trauma seriously, and prioritizing the male experience at the expense of survivors.
For instance, Turner’s victim, called Emily Doe, brought far more evidence to the table than most survivors ever could. Witnesses testified about seeing Turner commit the assault behind a dumpster — they were even the ones who called law enforcement — and DNA evidence incriminating Turner was collected immediately. In the vast majority of sexual assault cases, the only evidence survivors can really provide is their own testimony. To have as much evidence as Doe and still face what she did sent a clear message to other survivors in 2016. 
And today, in 2018, the recall of Aaron Persky sends an equally clear — but very different — message.
The successful campaign to recall Persky is a reflection of everything that #MeToo has dedicated the past year to fighting. It is a movement for gender parity, respect, justice and accountability — not only on Capitol Hill and in Hollywood, but also on college campuses and in our legal system. Beyond that, #MeToo is a movement founded upon a basic and unrelenting demand for tangible reform. That’s because words, memos, press releases and ad campaigns fall flat in the absence of concrete action. 
#MeToo has broken an age-old cycle. Specifically, men in positions of power who have abused or enabled the abuse of vulnerable victims are starting to lose that power. In Hollywood, we witnessed the long-awaited arrest of Harvey Weinstein last month. 
At USC, we witnessed the announcement of University President C.L. Max Nikias’ resignation due to the University administration’s handling of a  sexual misconduct allegation against a former campus gynecologist. And last week, we witnessed a judge whose 2016 decision told survivors everywhere that avoiding “severely impacting” a convicted abuser is of higher priority than according justice to survivors.
Across the country and around the world, justice for women and survivors remains unfinished business. But the successes of #MeToo show that we’re headed in the right direction — a monumental direction. It’s a direction that says talk is cheap, and actions and accountability speak infinitely louder than words.
