Tonight in San Diego, the USC Alumni Association and the Marshall Keenan MBA Career Resource Center will host their fourth Pink Slip Party, a networking program that has been praised for providing practical benefits and moral support to unemployed USC alumni.
These events invite Trojan alumni who are out of work to receive free one-on-one career counseling and résumé help from professionals.
Two pink slip parties have been held so far at venues in Los Angeles as well as one in San Francisco. Attendance has remained high since the parties began in June, with each event drawing about 200 alumni.
Scott Turner, associate director of the Alumni Career Services Program and founder of the Pink Slip Party program said he sees it as an opportunity for alumni to network and to realize they are not the only ones dealing with unemployment.
“A pink slip party is usually when laid off workers get together in a bar to feel better and talk about their experience,” Turner said. “I took this idea and modified it.”
For his version of a pink slip party, Turner has hired career coaches to teach people how to market themselves in an economic downturn. Turner works together with Scott Mory, CEO of the USC Alumni Association, to host these events.
“There are alumni out there who are in need of career support and moral support,” Mory said. “The idea is to provide a way for alumni who are going through a similar process to go through it together.”
Peter Giulioni, executive director of the Keenan MBA Career Resource Center, said these workshops can be “incredibly useful.” 
“Having a trained professional look at your résumé, getting people to validate that you have a good skill set and just meeting other people who are also in the job search process can all be very helpful to the alum who is seeking a job,” Giulioni said.
He said he thinks attendees benefit not just from the career advice but also from the emotional support.
“It feels like, ‘I’m not in this by myself, there are people here to help me, and the Trojan network is alive,’” Giulioni said. “It also takes away a little bit of the stigma of being a certain age and being out of work.”
Turner said the relaxed atmosphere of the events tends to draw younger alumni, but alumni of all ages have shown up at past events.
He said feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and he cited the career coaches as a key aspect of this success.
“The most important thing is the professional career coaches,” Turner said. “Being able to sit down for 15 minutes with a professional career coach for free is something you don’t really get to do anywhere else.”
There will be 11 career coaches at the San Diego event tonight, ranging from the President of Thompson Search to a vice president at the TriStaff Group. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will also be there to provide free financial advice. As of Monday evening, 200 USC alumni were already registered for the event.
USC seniors who will be venturing into the job market soon said they see value in events like the pink slip parties and are glad the Alumni Association is taking an active role in helping graduates find jobs.
“The closer I get to graduation without having a job, the more uneasy I become. But knowing that a post recruiting service exists does make me feel a bit more comfortable,” said Eric Gallegos, a senior majoring in accounting.
Turner said seniors are not the target market for the pink slip series, and plans are already in motion to hold the next event in Los Angeles this spring, but he sees no reason why seniors couldn’t go.
“There’s no reason at all why graduating seniors couldn’t attend,” Turner said. “They are getting ready to jump into the marketplace.”
Though the pink slip parties have received a lot of support, they are just one of many programs geared at helping unemployed alumni.
“The pink slip parties are happening in the context of a much greater initiative to help support our alumni in finding careers,” Mory said. “For the last year, the Alumni Association and the Career Planning and Placement Center have been involved with a campaign called ‘Trojans Hiring Trojans’ for alumni who are in a position to hire and want to help unemployed USC graduates.”

Thornton School of Music officials have confirmed that University Gateway Apartments, the new apartment complex across from campus, is being seriously considered as the new location for the school’s music practice rooms.

Thornton students currently practice in the Music Practice and Instructional Center (PIC), but the building is slated to be demolished at the end of the year. Officials had planned to move the practice rooms to the Von KleinSmid Library, but that plan fell apart late last semester. Now, the school is searching for a space on campus that will provide ample room and meet the proper technical specifications.
Thornton and the university have not had an easy time finding possible solutions, but Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta confirmed that University Gateway is on the list.
“It’s something that we’re seriously looking at,” he said.
The university submitted plans to architects involved with University Gateway in late February and expect to hear by mid-March if Gateway will be able to offer what the Thornton School needs.
University Gateway has allotted 33,500 square feet of space for non-retail, academic use for USC on the first floor of the building, according to Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president for Real Estate and Asset Management at USC.
PIC houses more than music practice rooms; it hosts the jazz studies program and various offices comprising five different departments. Keeping the space crunch in mind, the goal is to keep each department together respectively but not necessarily have all five departments in one facility, Cutietta said.
Some music students practice outdoors, but music students who specialize in piano or drums, for example, rely on indoor practice facilities.
Music students, most of whom had not heard that University Gateway was a potential option, had mixed opinions.
Josh Neill, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies with an emphasis in drums, said he selected his housing so he could be near PIC.
“I kind of live here. I think all the jazz majors do,” Neill said.
Though students said they thought PIC could use some renovations, most appreciate the central location of the building.
“I really don’t understand why we can’t just stay there,” said Marcus Paul, a freshman majoring in jazz studies. “Everyone uses it pretty much everyday.”
Students said they think the location of University Gateway is inconvenient. Their overall concern, however, is whether the new facility will have enough practice rooms.
“Any practice rooms are better than none,” said Kyle Mylonakis, a freshman majoring in tuba performance.

A number of rising juniors and seniors hoping to secure university housing were disappointed last week when USC Housing informed them that all spots have been filled. But for students hoping to earn spots as resident advisors, the announcement was particularly alarming.
Despite the 4 percent increase in  university-owned housing prices, the number of housing applicants rose, according to Keenan Cheung, director of USC Housing. This means more sophomores and juniors looking for housing were turned away.
Most students turned down by USC Housing still have some time left to secure non-university housing; though the process is intimidating, it is by no means impossible. The students looking for R.A. positions, however, are stuck. They cannot sign a non-university housing lease because of the chance that they will be given the R.A. position and will be living in the dorms, but less than half of them will actually get the position.
According to Elizabeth Peterson, assistant director for staff development and diversity, final R.A. decisions are announced in April. Applicants are instructed to apply for university housing as part of the general lottery in February to secure a spot. If chosen, they will be reimbursed for housing and moved into an R.A. room.
This process, however, does not work for students like Caitlin Finnigan, a sophomore majoring in history and an R.A. hopeful who did not secure housing through the lottery.
Finnigan said she is frustrated with the housing process.
“If UCLA can guarantee university housing for all four years for all undergraduates and they have more students than we do, USC should be able to guarantee housing for all four years,” she said.
USC only recently began guaranteeing housing for sophomores, a move  seen as a huge victory. The university has constantly been working to improve the housing issue, but Cheung acknowledged that it can create problems for R.A. applicants and others.
“It’s always, unfortunately, the juniors and seniors that have a rough time getting university housing,” Cheung said.
Kara Lemma, residential coordinator for Birnkrant Residential College, said it would be nearly impossible to coordinate the R.A. selection process with the housing process.
“It would be really difficult for us to speed up the process,” she said. “I suppose the only thing they could really consider doing is teach EDCO in the fall, but that doesn’t give as many people the opportunity to become R.A.s and we don’t have the same kind of pool. It’s tough, it really is tough.”
Lemma said she thinks USC Housing and the Office for Residential Education need to find a solution.
“We probably need to put our heads together to figure out a plan to at least guarantee housing for R.A. applicants,” Lemma said. “We could probably step that up a lot so that they are not stuck trying to scramble for housing in April. By then, all the spots around campus in privately-owned housing are gone.”
Lemma said applicants who don’t get USC Housing are stuck in a bad situation, adding that if students are unhappy with their housing it can affect their college experience.
“It’s incredibly difficult to be put on the waitlist and cross your fingers that you get something,” she said. “My concern with this whole thing is that these are students we’re talking about. If you don’t have stable living conditions, it’s extremely difficult to do really well in school.”
Housing has been a factor for applicants in previous years, according to second-year R.A. Michael Neagoe, a junior majoring in business administration.
“Anytime you apply to be an R.A. you have to take that into consideration,” Neagoe said. “There’s a time you’ll be unsure about housing. What you can do is apply for housing too or work it out with friends.”
For students not involved in the residential advisor program, university housing is an easier and more affordable alternative to searching for private housing — if it is available when their lottery time rolls around.
“It’s stressful to look for privately-owned housing around campus,” said Lindsay Thomson, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Thomson, who secured a spot for the fall of her junior year, said she thinks it is fair that USC can’t guarantee housing.
“It’s pretty reasonable,” she said. “The campus isn’t big enough to accommodate everyone. Two years is pretty good.”
The university housing capacity is 6,800 beds, both on-campus and off-campus, which is not enough for the approximately 8,000 applicants, according to Cheung.
The university has fixed housing for a certain number of graduate students and families, while juniors and seniors are able to select from the remaining 500 to 800 spaces before USC housing runs out, he said.
This housing problem is  one area that USC has really dropped the ball and let students and families down. Places not owned by USC may be cheaper, (are they really when utilties etc. are extras?) but seriously, many are HORRIBLE. Wrought iron bars and fences the height of the apartment complexes are not comforting since that pretty much means UGLY and a HIGH CRIME AREA. Smaller houses not totally fenced in, vulnerable to break ins in a dicey area at best. USC’s recent purchase of the little building where the restaurant is and taking over the rooms upstairs, making them USC housing is a joke. HOW MANY does that fit? Please! Gateway beat USC to the punch. Nice but expensive for some. Where the heck was USC? If that is their land why couldn’t they build there? Why are they waiting? Did all their money go to purchasing a hospital instead? WHY???  It is just not fair to students or families. It is crazy, chaotic and inexcusable that a school like USC is so behind and puts everyone through this ridiculous angst ridden lottery system. If it were some kind of utopian perfect neighborhood free from crime and safe to walk in and live in, MAYBE it would be accetable, but sadly, it is not. When will USC wake up and do something about this huge problem? For the tuition they get from us, at least they can create enough housing. . Geez…
I guess all those young kids and families that want to live in affordable, healthy housing and want to also be safe by living in crime free areas don’t matter too much since they don’t pay tuition. 
Students are and have been gentrifying the local neighborhoods north of campus for generations.  Although I can not blame students for lack of housing, I can blame them, along with many landlords and USC for participating in discriminatory, and sometimes outright racist, behavior and actions towards the local community.
USC – University of South Central
Since you’re a LOCAL RESIDENT and you call USC-University of South Central, I guess you’re proud to live in this deplorable part of Los Angeles. When you try to make your rants sound all intelligent, be aware of how you demean your own neighborhood. What is “healthy housing?” And what denotes “generations?” years, decades, what? 
You made yourself look dumb.
The housing situation at USC is abysmal and a source of great stress for students and parents alike. As a parent, I seem to be unique among my peers in having a child go to a school where off-campus housing is even more expensive than on-campus housing. That is not the case in most locales, and it is a direct result of the university’s insufficient attention to its housing shortage.
The time it takes each year for the student to solve his or her housing problems for the coming term, and the anxiety that goes with it, completely detracts from his or her learning and from his or her satisfaction with the entire university experience. Issues of what to do during the summer, during semesters abroad, and when one’s housemate suddenly drops out, and all the hassles — not to mention the potential for legal troubles — involved in subletting during these times only compound the problem.
The university must do more to provide a sense of security and stability by significantly increasing the number of beds it provides, even if it needs be the one signing the leases for much of the privately owned housing in the area. When that still falls short of demand, it must do more to help students search for privately owned housing and do more to actively facilitate the search for sublets. 
Students should not be spending so much of their time and energies dealing with the problem of where to live next year; they should be focused on their studies and on contributing to all the curricular and extracurricular activities that make USC so special. The university must do more. We’re certainly paying them enough.
The search for housing, on or off campus, can indeed be stressful. But “SL” isn’t entirely correct in stating that off-campus housing is more expensive than on-campus. Of course one can find expensive housing in any city, but there are also many privately owned, all-student houses within walking distance of USC where a large, private room costs less than a bed in a shared room on campus.

After losing three straight games and scoring only six runs, USC head coach Chad Kreuter decided it was time for a lineup change.
Base hit· Junior infielder Joe De Pinto, pictured here in Sunday’s Dodgertown Classic at Dodger Stadium, went 3-for-4 in Tuesday’s 10-5 win. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
For at least one night, it worked.
Kreuter shuffled the batting order and the Trojans responded, scoring 10 runs on 12 hits in a 10-5 road victory at Long Beach State.
The victory got the Trojans (4-4) back to .500 after starting the season 3-1.
Sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa, the team’s leader in home runs and RBIs last season, batted leadoff. Senior outfielder Mike O’Neill, who had hit first or second in every game this season, batted third.
And both men delivered.
Oropesa homered and scored two runs, and O’Neill reached base and scored a run as well.
The Trojans trailed 3-0 two innings into the game. The Dirtbags began the second with three straight hits off of junior starter Brett Williams, including a run-scoring double and a two-run home run.
But Williams, who hadn’t pitched more than two-third of an inning in his previous three appearances, settled down. He allowed four runs in 4 1/3 innings of work in his first start.
The Trojans responded with a seven-run outburst in the top of the third, and never looked back.
Sophomore outfielder Alex Sherrod tied the game at 3-3 with a three-run home run to right centerfield. Junior third baseman Matt Hart followed with a double and advanced to third on a wild pitch before sophomore Matt Foat struck out for the second out of the inning.
It looked like the inning could have ended when sophomore first baseman Beau Brett hit a grounder to Long Beach State shortstop Kirk Singer. But Singer committed an error on the play, allowing Brett to reach base and Hart to score, giving USC a 4-3 lead.
The Trojans kicked the door down two batters later, when sophomore second baseman Ashton Kent homered to make it 7-3.
USC added two more runs in the top of the fourth, taking advantage of another Long Beach error, this one by second baseman Matt Duffy.
But Long Beach continued to claw back, scoring a run in the bottom of the fifth and chasing Williams from the game. Junior Chris Mezger came on in relief and allowed a run in the bottom of the seventh, cutting the lead to 9-4
Oropesa’s homer in the top of the eighth gave USC a 10-5 lead, and the Trojans held on from there.
Mezger, who last pitched one-third of an inning on Feb. 20 against Cal Poly, went 4 2/3 innings in relief of Williams and earned the victory. It was the first of his collegiate career.
Junior shortstop Joe De Pinto, hitting second in the lineup, had three hits and scored twice. Kent finished the day with two hits, a run scored and three RBIs.
USC will return home for a three-game series this weekend at Dedeaux Field against New Mexico.

March is sneaky.
The other day, it crept up behind me more quietly than Elmer Fudd, tapped me on my opposite shoulder and then laughed as I looked the other way.
I couldn’t help but smile, as I was finally reunited with my good buddy.
We walked to class together and discussed many things. I caught a whiff of spring break as we ventured past the lovely ladies of McCarthy Quad, sunbathing so that they are tan by spring break. I felt the presence of baseball as we caught a glimpse of Dedeaux Field. We joked that March’s step-sister, February, was saved by the glass slipper of the Olympics.
But mostly we reminisced about the best times we’ve had in the past and the new memories we will create this year with the NCAA basketball tournament.
March couldn’t contain its excitement when discussing how basketball has become relevant again on Tommy Trojan’s campus. We relived one of the best games of the tournament last year: USC’s close loss to eventual runner-up Michigan State in the second round.
When I reminded March that USC won’t be in the tournament this year, it lowered its eyes and looked to the ground.
That’s when it hit me. Even though USC inflicted self-harm by banning itself from any postseason play this year, this current team has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, when the Trojans walk off the court for the last time this season at around 1 p.m. Saturday in Tuscon, Ariz., they should hold their heads high.
This group of players — a collection of castoffs, transfers, role players and rappers — performed more admirably than anybody expected.
After losing its coach and top three core players over the summer, USC was written off as an easy win on almost every Pac-10 team’s calendar. The Trojans were projected to finish ninth in the Pac-10 and last in sympathy points.
It looked that way early, with an embarrassing home loss to Loyola Marymount and blowouts at the hands of Texas and Georgia Tech.
Then, something straight out a Disney movie happened. The Trojans started winning. Not just winning but smothering ranked opponents with their asphyxiating defense.
That eight-game win streak in December gave the team and the entire school hope for something that seemed impossible just a few weeks before.
It was all thanks to the basketball team’s own Trojan Horse. Hidden amid the USC roster was Mike Gerrity, a scrappy guard formerly of Pepperdine and Charlotte. He kept schooling the five-star recruits of Tennessee and Arizona and they kept following his every dribble.
Gerrity, a senior, led the Trojan Fever fans on that remarkable run. After the dismemberment of No. 9 Tennessee, the steady wins over St. Mary’s and No. 20 UNLV and the solid 2-0 start to Pac-10 play, it seemed as if the Trojans were bound to overcome the Mt. Vesuvius-sized odds and make the NCAA tournament.
Then Mt. Vesiuvius erupted.
Jan. 3, 2010 might go down as the saddest and darkest Sunday in USC basketball history. With one quick statement by Athletic Director Mike Garrett, the dreams of players who put in hours upon hours of conditioning, weight lifting, sprints and jump shots (well, maybe not so much the jump shots part — USC ranks 325th out of 334 Division-I teams in scoring offense) were cut apart as easily as a sharp knife slices through a tender rib eye.
“I hope I don’t ever have to do that again because when you break young people’s dreams and hearts that’s hard to do,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said the day after he had to inform his players of the sanctions.
USC lost its first game after the announcement — a one-point loss to Stanford. Nobody would have blamed them if they went on to lose the rest of their games and finish 10th in the Pac-10. If they couldn’t be in the tournament, what was the point of playing anymore?
It turns out, even though wins and losses technically didn’t matter, the players still found that they could enjoy themselves on the court. They beat the Pac-10 leader, Cal, and the team many predicted to join the Golden Bears in the tournament, Washington.
“To play against a team that knows they’re playing for nothing and can’t go to a tournament, they’re just out there having fun,” Washington junior guard Venoy Overton said after USC beat the Huskies in January.
Then there was something that O.J. Mayo, DeMar DeRozan and Tim Floyd never did — sweep UCLA.
As it sits now, USC is fourth in the Pac-10 and could finish as high as second if it wins out this weekend. The Trojans have been getting respect nationally for their defense as they rank third in the country in scoring defense.
With these numbers, some people might feel USC deserves to go to the Big Dance. Because of past events, that won’t happen, but it’s not because of a lack of effort, heart and desire shown by the current team.

After an intense match against No. 9 Stanford, the road does not get any easier as the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team heads across town to play the No. 6 UCLA Bruins today.
Premiere · Junior Peter Lucassen made his debut in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s singles rankings this week, coming in at No. 76. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
This match will be the second time the rivals meet this season. The Trojans (11-1, 0-0) dominated the Bruins 4-0 at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in February.
During the first meeting, USC only dropped one close doubles match and one tight singles set during a consolation round.
Senior Robert Farah, junior Jaak Poldma and junior Peter Lucassen all won their singles matches, and sophomore Steve Johnson and sophomore Daniel Nguyen had leads in their sets when the match ended.
Coming off a memorable 4-3 win in Palo Alto, Calif., and with one victory over UCLA already to their name, the Trojans will have momentum heading into this match.
Momentum does not guarantee a positive result for the Trojans, however, especially when facing a bitter rival away from home.
USC has historically struggled at UCLA (6-2, 0-0), and the Trojans do not expect today’s match to go as smoothly as the previous one.
“It’s never easy to play UCLA; it’s been a tough environment for us,” Johnson said when describing matches at the Los Angeles Tennis Center — the Bruins’ home court.
In the current ITA rankings — released March 2 — the Trojans boast three ranked doubles teams and six ranked singles players, including No. 3 Johnson and No. 9 Farah. Also, No. 76 Lucassen makes his first appearance in the singles rankings.
The Bruins have four ranked singles players and two doubles squads.
The recent performance of Nguyen has garnered attention as he earned Pac-10 Men’s Tennis Player of the Week honors, living up to his nickname — D-Win.
Nguyen won both singles and doubles matches against San Diego State, and his performances against Stanford really stood out, with a dominating 6-2, 6-4 singles victory and the match-clinching doubles victory with Johnson.
“[Nguyen] really came up with some big points in doubles — he was just so clutch,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “He is proving to be one of our go-to performers.”
The Trojans will definitely be motivated to beat their rivals for the second time this season.
“I don’t care where, when or how we play UCLA; we are always extra-motivated to play them,” Smith said. “That is a special match no matter what.”
The match is scheduled to start at 3 p.m.

USC freshman T.J. Vogel fired a second-round 63, a tournament low and two strokes off the course record, on his way to a second place finish Tuesday at the USC Collegiate Invitational at the North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village, Calif.
Vogel’s strong play led the No. 16 Trojans to a tie for fourth in their home event, finishing 20 strokes behind tournament champions No. 17 Oregon.
After an up-and-down first round Monday morning, Vogel lit up the course in the afternoon, shooting the best score of his young collegiate career.
“In order to win a national title, we need guys that can flat out play,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “And when somebody shows that they can, that’s huge.”
Vogel got off to a quick start, making birdies on four of his first six holes. After playing the next six holes to even par, Vogel hit his tee shot into the water on a par 3 and made a double bogey on his 13th hole of the day.
He bounced back immediately, making eagle on the next hole, a 522-yard par 5. Vogel closed his round with four consecutive birdies to post an 8-under-par 63.
Vogel began Tuesday’s final round with the lead but Oregon’s Eugene Wong shot 69 to Vogel’s 71 to take the title by one shot. Vogel missed a 20-foot putt on his last hole for birdie that would have tied him with Wong.
“We felt at the beginning of the year that he was a real key to our success,” Zambri said about Vogel. “To have him get it going is great.”
Sophomore Steve Lim also turned in a solid performance for the Trojans, shooting 69-73-69 to finish in a tie for 13th at 2 under par.
Freshman Martin Trainer overcame an opening round 77 to finish 73-70 and tie for 48th. Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff shot 75-74-75 to finish in a tie for 60th.
The struggles continued for USC’s two-time All-American Matt Giles, who shot 69-77-83 to finish in a tie for 75th in the 80-man field.
“My ball striking this week was absolutely terrible,” Giles said. “It was flat out embarrassing.”
Zambri said he thought the tough outing would actually benefit Giles.
“Sometimes that stuff happens, and it really forces you to evaluate what you’re doing,” Zambri said. “I think it’s something that’s going to end up being very helpful for Matthew to have gone through this week the way he did.”
Three Trojans played in the tournament as individuals. Freshman Stewart Hagestad finished tied for 43rd, junior Daniel Park tied for 53rd and freshman Sam Smith tied for 73rd.
USC finished the tournament in the middle of the Pac-10 teams competing, finishing behind Oregon (first), No. 21 California (second) and No. 14 Arizona State (third) and in front of No. 2 Stanford (eighth), No. 11 UCLA (ninth) and No. 15 Oregon State (tied for 12th).
“We’re going to have to get better and play better if we’re going to compete with teams like [Oregon],” Zambri said.
The Trojans will return to action next Friday, March 12, at the Southern Highlands Collegiate in Las Vegas.

The No. 13 USC men’s swimming team is looking to build on its success this season and make an impact at the Pac-10 championships starting today at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach, Calif.
Team effort · Sophomore Richard Charlesworth is part of the USC 800-yard freestyle relay team, which is among the favorites at the Pac-10 championships. The four-member team is ranked second going into the event. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
The team is mainly made up of freshmen and sophomores and continues to develop under a relatively new program. There is no doubt the Trojans have quite the task ahead of them, as they will be competing in arguably the toughest conference in the nation and against some of the best athletes in the world.
“We may only finish in fourth in the Pac-10,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “With Stanford, Cal and Arizona being talked about as NCAA team champions, it is easily understood that the Pac-10 swimming and diving championships are intense.”
Relays will be key, particularly the 800-yard freestyle relay, an event that USC is quickly becoming known for across the country because of its all-star lineup: sophomore Patrick White, senior Zoltan Povazsay, freshman Clement Lefert and sophomore Richard Charlesworth.
“The men feel as though that is our event to win and has been a season goal all year,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said.
The Trojan sprint relay has also made leaps and bounds since last year, with the help of sophomore Jeff Daniels who holds an NCAA consideration time in the 100-yard freestyle (43.94) and junior Emmett Walling who also holds one in the 50-yard freestyle (20.19).
“We expect our relays to compete well,” Salo said.
Though the level of performance has improved throughout the entire squad, the team will be relying on standout swimmers, such as Povaszay and co-captain White, Lefert, junior Dillon Connolly and freshman Alex Lendrum to rack up the points.
“We finally have at least two men in each event that will compete for top-3 finishes in their respective events,” Kipp said. “There is not one particular event that we look at and think we don’t have a chance to compete.”
Povaszay has been consistent in the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle events this season and holds NCAA consideration cuts in both events. Furthermore, Lefert’s 500-yard freestyle (4:19.60) is ranked fifth in the nation right now, and his 200-yard butterfly (1:44.28) isn’t far behind, ranking eighth in the nation.
Connolly is ranked 17th in the nation for his 100-yard breaststroke (54.44) and will be a key competitor for the Trojans in the breaststroke events this week, as he will be looking to medal and qualify for the NCAA championship.
White has performed almost every time he has entered the water this season, and the expectation is that this week will be no different. Already sporting two NCAA consideration times in the 200-yard freestyle and the 500-yard freestyle, the co-captain will be looking to further improve on these results and compete for a top-eight stop in the Pac-10.

Although the film awards season has yet to culminate in its grandest Hollywood spectacle — the Academy Awards, which will take place at the Kodak Theater on March 7 — the mudslinging, slander and general poor taste has been ransacking this town since the shiny statue-presenting season began last December. But no one has stirred the pot quite like Nicolas Chartier, one of the four producers of best picture contender The Hurt Locker.
On Feb. 19, Chartier sent out a mass e-mail to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters and significant film industry professionals that solicited votes for The Hurt Locker, which is already considered one of the leading films in the Oscar race, over that  “$500M film.” Although Chartier never mentions Jame Cameron’s Avatar by name, chances are he’s not talking about the indie powerhouse Precious.
The Academy must have picked up on Chartier’s cattiness as well, for the executive committee of the Academy’s Producer Branch convened late Monday to discuss how to discipline Chartier. According to the Academy, Chartier disregarded the rule of “casting a negative or derogatory light on a competing film.” As a result, the Academy’s Producer Branch announced Tuesday Chartier is prohibited from attending the Academy Awards ceremony. However, if The Hurt Locker were to win the award for Best Picture, Chartier is still able to receive a statue — at some point after March 7.
As The Hurt Locker is already a strong contender for Best Picture, it’s difficult to imagine the thought process behind Chartier’s e-mail. With nominations in also the best director, leading actor and original screenplays categories, the critically acclaimed film on the Iraq war might leave Sunday empty-handed if Chartier’s poor campaigning taste ultimately left an unfavorable impression on Academy voters.
But as entertainment blogger Nikki Finke of “Deadline Hollywood” pointed out in multiple posts on Chartier’s situation, back alley campaigning, badmouthing and bribing are age-old art forms, and to most working in Hollywood, Chartier’s “vote for us” e-mail was just one of many received during award season.
So don’t worry, The Hurt Locker — you still get the highest bid on our ballot.

Jerry Brown, California Democratic attorney general and a longtime Californian politician, announced his candidacy for governor this morning over a video posted on his website.
Brown, 71, discussed the current state of California politics and said the state government has hit problems because of a lack of experience in Sacramento.
“We found out that not knowing is not good. We need someone with insider’s knowledge but an outsiders mind,” Brown said in the taped video.
Brown served as governor of California from 1975 to 1983. He was also elected as Oakland’s mayor for 9 years and California’s secretary of state. He has been serving as the California Democratic attorney general since 2007. Brown said he has seen the California government from every angle because of his various positions over the years, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Brown emphasized that Californians must work together, whether that means republicans working with democrats, oil companies working with environmentalists, or unions working with business.
He also told viewers no new taxes would approved unless people voted for them and that Sacramento needs to give authority and decision making power back to cities, counties and local schools.
“At this stage in my life I’m prepared to focus on nothing else but fixing this state I love,” Brown said.
The Los Angeles Times reported that Brown had been planning on running for two years now and faces no “serious primary election opposition.”
Brown will be running against Republican candidate Meg Whitman, former eBay CEO or Steve Poizner, who is currently serving as the California Insurance Commissioner.

Move over Stanford.
Monday afternoon the USC Athletic Department congratulated some of the nation’s best collegiate athletes for their academic achievements during the 2009 fall semester.
Trojan student-athletes not only dominated the NCAA on the field, court, pool, pitch, and putting green in 2009, but also managed to make “student” a relevant portion of their job description. Two hundred and eighty-five individuals from across the athletic department, nearly half of USC’s student-athlete population, earned at least a 3.0 GPA, and 117 of them made Dean’s List, which requires a 3.5.
“Trojan student-athletes are dedicated to excellence, making a commitment to their success both inside and outside the classroom,” gushed the athletic department in an online salute.
Eight of USC’s 19 teams recorded a team GPA of at least 3.0, led by the women’s cross country team who earned a collective 3.32 last fall. No team had more student-athletes with at least a 3.0 GPA than the women’s crew team, who represented almost 15 percent of the individuals honored by the athletic department (42 of 285).
USC women’s tennis team earned “most improved” by adding .29 points to last spring’s 3.0 GPA.  The women earned academic honors while tallying a 21-3 season record.
Freshman forward Davis Rozitis, originally from Latvia, is a lone representative for the men’s basketball team on the 3.0 and above honor roll.
classof 75..
Jeff Byers has a 3.3 GPA and has graduated with an MBA.  He absolutely deserved to be mentioned but whoever wrote this is clueless.  Only about 10-15 football players out of 85 on scholarship have a GPA over 3.0..
Its the NCAA’s fault. They just do not want to look like the bad guy!
I find it curious, even humorous that there is no mention of a single football player, and only one basketball player mentioned in this propaganda piece.  Don’t get me wrong, I am as proud of our women athletes as the next Trojan alum.  I just want to be clear.  So what you’re telling me by not telling me, is that the two primary revenue sports are really in the entertainment business, and NOT in the education business.  No wonder the NCAA is looking at us through a magnifying glass.

What if you could come home to your dorm room or apartment and enjoy a hot plate of Thai coconut curry or chicken parmesan all without having to cook or defrost?
The Dish’s Dish, a chef service new to Los Angeles, offers both working adults and students a way to enjoy any food they want to try, for a fixed weekly fee.
The company began in 2006 when founder Jill Donenfeld had a new idea for those who crave home cooking but don’t have the time to do it themselves. Instead of offering costly full-time chefs, Donenfeld has assembled a team of culinistas who will make weekly house calls, buy the groceries, create six to eight dishes in your kitchen and box them all up for a week’s worth of grub.
“You have the chef all to yourself,” Donenfeld said. “They can make anything. You can ask for hardcore comfort food one week and then the next week, if you’re interested in trying macrobiotic, she can do a whole macrobiotic spread for you. It’s completely customized.”
Donenfeld attended college in New York City but always wrote food reviews and maintained other culinary-industry side projects. Then, a family she babysat for asked her to cook something they could nibble on throughout the week and she saw an opportunity. By graduation, she had four clients and the start of a brand-new business.
“I had $5,000 in my bank account, and I thought I should just go for it,” Donenfeld said. “I was 21 at the time, so I figured if I failed it would be OK … I didn’t have much to lose.”
Hiring two private chefs to assist with her growing clientele, she began what would become the essential service of The Dish’s Dish — a chef who comes in, cooks and then gets out of your way. Originally based in New York, The Dish’s Dish services were utilized by everyone from busy parents to time-strapped students.
“[Students] like it because they can come home after being in a library all night and have good food completely tailored to them,” Donenfeld said. “It’s basically like having their mom come over once a week and say ‘OK honey, what do you want? I’ll make it for you just the way you like it.’”
The service costs $300 per week, plus the cost of groceries, which sounds steep, but it is capable of feeding a whole household. Donenfeld said three money-savvy New York University roommates split the bill and enjoyed home-cooked food for the whole year.
In January, the company expanded into Los Angeles, and in addition to serving households, the company now cooks for parties and special events.
To crunch a few numbers, USC’s Cardinal meal plan costs $2,521 for the semester. That includes 10 meals per week and $510 dining dollars. The Dish’s Dish service costs $300 plus groceries (let’s say $150) and covers around seven meals. Split that with two roommates and that’s about $2,250 per semester for fresh, completely customized, homemade food. It is certainly more expensive but offers benefits and taste that Everybody’s Kitchen can’t quite compare to.
Want to sample the world’s cuisine? Culinistas will prepare any kind of meal, from French to Japanese to even African or Caribbean. Culinistas will also cook for any special diet, be it gluten-free or vegan.
Of course, actions speak louder than press releases. The Dish’s Dish was kind enough to send over my very own culinista, a young chef named Gaby Dalkin.
Because I wanted to see for myself the flexibility of the service, I asked for one ethnic dish and one vegan dish. Our menu? Thai coconut curry, chicken parmesan, roasted herb potatoes and an apple crisp. I would like to say that Dalkin just came in and cooked, but that would skip over an interesting aspect of The Dish’s Dish service — the personal touch.
“My favorite part about being a culinista is being able to nourish my clients with great food when they don’t always have the time to make it themselves,” Dalkin said. “They are always so appreciative, and the way these dinners bring them together is great.”
For the next hour, Dalkin and I chatted about everything from making curry to favorite food blogs — all while she whipped up a fabulous meal. I felt as if I could ask any food or cooking-related question or just talk about Julie & Julia.
When her job was done, the taste testing began. Each dish was delicious, from the savory chicken parmesan to the warming apple crisp. Even more, the dishes were restaurant quality without being restaurant-heavy, making them a fantastic alternative to eating out night after night. That, too, is one of Donenfeld’s aims for the company.
“My goal is to help people become more conscious eaters,” Donenfeld said. “I think the way to do that is to make eating at home easier and more delicious.”
In addition to just cooking, The Dish’s Dish allows clients to accompany their culinistas to the farmers market and gain familiarity with the whole cooking process. The company even has a DVD set for those who want cooking lessons. But at its core, The Dish’s Dish is there to provide good food for busy people.
“People love it; it adds ease to their lives,” Donenfeld said. “They love when their chefs will turn them on to a new food or a new dish. They love when we get their kids eating new things. And for students in college, they just like that they don’t have to think about it, and they’re not gaining the freshman 15 because they’re not eating all that pizza in the middle of the night.”

There was palpable energy in Bovard Auditorium Monday night, the kind that only music can create. Fans of performance painter David Garibaldi filled the seats to witness the artist create pieces to music in an event organized by USG Program Board.
In sync · While music played, artist David Garibaldi painted several portraits of popular culture icons such as Lady Gaga and Albert Einstein. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
While the audience waited for the performance to begin, a D.J. sent bass notes reverberating throughout the auditorium. The stage was cloaked in semidarkness with one spotlight trained on the D.J. at the left of the stage.
When the lights went out, a black canvas appeared on a metal stand. Garibaldi finally appeared clad in jeans, a dark shirt, a leather jacket, an eye-catching yellow belt and sneakers.
“Are you ready for this?” Garibaldi asked the crowd. “What you are about to experience is something I call rhythm and hue.”
Garibaldi began by promptly getting his hands dirty; by the end of the performance, his pants and shirt were similarly messy. He passionately grasped two paintbrushes and dipped them into cans of paint before flicking off the excess. His movements were dexterous and quick, synced with the fast-paced music that was playing in the background.
Garibaldi began with a few ambiguous dabs, but the outline of a face soon emerged. He applied the paint to the canvas in quick, agile motions, somehow matching the music and creating a work before the audience’s eyes.
The canvas sometimes shook with the force of his paint strokes. At the end of each finished painting, he dramatically smacked the canvas — his trademark signature.
Garibaldi held nothing back, throwing paintbrushes in the air and sometimes using his own hand to send droplets splashing onto the canvas.
Years ago, he spent his time giving birth to a different type of creation.
“It was graffiti and it was illegal, but I just wanted to paint. I just wanted to create,” Garibaldi said. “You could find me painting on anything standing.”
Garibaldi didn’t always have a clear vision of what he wanted rhythm and hue to be. After encouragement from a helpful teacher, he became interested in painting and short animated filmmaking.
After high school, Garibaldi held various odd jobs but found himself generally unsatisfied. He went on to attend art school and began to paint. Sitting on a friend’s couch one day, he marveled at a large painting of Jimi Hendrix and found inspiration. He began to perform shows at jazz clubs or wherever music met art.
Garibaldi’s intention is to create not only engaging pieces but an interactive experience for his audience. During certain moments, he runs or walks toward the front of the stage, facing the audience. He sometimes jumps in the air or walks to the microphone and urges the audience to get rowdy.
In Monday’s performance, he started off with a painting of John Lennon and moved on to a replica of Lady Gaga while a medley of her biggest hits played in the background.
After a few of his characteristic direct stabs at the painting, the image of Lady Gaga was apparent.
At one point, Garibaldi painted a portrait of Michael Jackson while a mix tape of the late artist’s classics played. Blending emotion and music seamlessly, Garibaldi encouraged those in attendance to make some noise as “Dirty Diana” began to blare from the speakers while he passionately added thick, red strokes to the portrait.
He went on to speak briefly about President Obama before painting him while a fusion of songs and audio clips of Obama’s voice filled Bovard. He rounded out the night with an upside-down creation of Albert Einstein.
Besides bringing together two powerful mediums, Garibaldi wanted to leave his audience with a specific message.
“This platform to create could be more than just to entertain,” Garibaldi said. “It could be to benefit and inspire.”
In his own life, Garibaldi appears to take these words to heart. At 27, the painter has already managed to raise $500,00 for non-profit organizations and hopes to raise $1 million by the time he is 30.
“These passions live in each and every one of us,” Garibaldi said, two thick marks of paint splayed across the side of his face. “My only hope is that we use our creativity to benefit and inspire.”
Garibaldi remained after the show to speak with attendees and sign autographs, speaking to his fans in a warm and friendly manner.
Garibaldi succeeded at not only entertaining but sharing thought-provoking statements about the meaning of passion and the importance of using one’s creativity to help others.
My daughter told me about Garibaldi and sent me a link to one of his Youtube performances.  I was lucky enough to attend his performance on Monday night at USC and I can tell you that I’m so glad I did.  He was great, and at the same time inspiring.  I really enjoyed seeing him.  Your article was right on.  Everything you said was the way it was.  Perhaps one day others will be lucky enough to experience him too.

Most teenagers have to forgo college in order to seriously play in a band, but the students in the USC Thornton School of Music popular music performance major get graded on it. So while the rest of the school was buried in essays and study guides Monday night, students in professors Will Dohr and Andy Abad’s popular music performance class took to the Grammy Museum’s Sound Stage for a free concert that doubled as their midterm.
Testing · The showcase split the class of freshmen into four bands with each playing a set of covers from funk, soul and classic rock artists. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
The popular music program, which was founded in fall 2009, is the first of its kind in the nation. It combines studies in songwriting, musicianship and entertainment business for students pursuing careers in the modern music landscape.
Unlike most music performance majors that spend their first few years focusing on in-class instruction, the  23 freshmen and six transfers in the popular music program are required to play a gig — it’s part of the class curriculum.
Separated into bands on the first day of class, students learn the realities of their chosen profession by spending their semester with hours rehearsing and preparing for shows.
Monday’s event featured four student bands — except for a few D-clearance cases, all are popular music majors — playing a repertoire of funk, soul and classic rock songs selected by the faculty to teach certain rhythm and ensemble skills. The showcase also marks the first publically advertised off-campus appearance by the students, as the venue for last semester’s Motown-themed final was inadequate for crowds.
The venue was nearly full when Program Director Chris Sampson’s presence onstage hushed the crowd. But silence wasn’t necessary here — in fact, Sampson encouraged the audience to get loud.
“I know you’re seated and there are programs, but this isn’t a recital,” Sampson said. “If you have to dance, dance. If you like what they’re playing, let them know.”
With that, the first group of students — a nine-piece who named their band Winston after guitarist Winston Richards — ripped into a full-bodied cover of Gladys Knight & The Pips’ “I’ve Got To Use My Imagination.” The band (and program’s) two saxophone players wailed behind singers Sarah Ames and Annie Dingwall whose powerful voices thundered through the room. Al Green and Aretha Franklin covers followed suit, but it was the band’s last song, James Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” that was its strongest.
Moved by the intensity of her own voice, Dingwall came toward the crowd as she motioned the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes and the Jump Back Jack along with the lyrics. The song ended with a solo from saxophonist Justin Klunk and — taking Sampson’s advice — the audience cheered him on.
The second band was an eight-piece with only a three-song set. Calling itself Lick — Sampson joked that working on band names was in next semester’s agenda — the band lacked the energy of the first, but it could have been my craving for more horns. Drummer Will Geer let his beat slip a few times during the complex pre-chorus time signatures of James Brown’s “I Got The Feelin’,” but if he had kept his poker face on the slip up could have gone unnoticed. Singer Lily Housh owned it on Led Zepplin’s “Rock and Roll,” however, and gave the headbang-worthy song a much-needed female voice.
The third band didn’t give its name, but with Peter Johnson wearing an orange-speckled, Flying V, electric violin on his shoulder, and introduction of the first female instrumentalist, Molly Miller, it was  definitely the most visually interesting. It started out with Sly & the Family Stone’s first pop-infused hit, “Dance to the Music,” a brave choice as the song features four lead singers and an a capella scat before each verse. But the eight-piece pulled it off, using every instrument onstage, including voices, to recreate the original band’s multi-sonic personality.
The highlight of the entire show, however, was the band’s cover of James Brown’s “Super Bad.” A distorted violin solo, which sounded more like a jazz flute, was a unique touch to the intricate song. But without its signature horn arrangements, it was singer Lara Johnston — the cute-as-a-button daughter of Doobie Brothers’ singer Tom Johnston — who brought out the song’s essence. Her adorableness belies pipes as super bad as the song title and when she belted out “I got soul” with impressive fluctuations, she made you believe it.
The final band utilized the program’s only male vocalist, Christian Stranne, who put a masculine perspective back into James Brown’s “I Got the Feelin.’” Stranne then switched to one of the keyboards and singer-songwriter Rozzi Crane took the microphone for the last few covers. Joni Mitchell’s “Help Me” paired Crane’s sultry vocals with the only acoustic-guitar sighting of the night while a performance of Earth, Wind & Fire’s “That’s the Way of the World” showcased a guitar solo from YouTube sensation Luke Walton.
The show ended with the last band performing Sly & The Family Stone’s “Thank You,” an appropriate song for a group of students whose major allows them to explore their musical interests freely. The chorus — Thank you for letting me be myself — sung by Crane and her bandmates could easily be interpreted as a summation of the students’ experiences during their first semester and a half in the popular music program. And when the music finally stopped, the audience’s applause said, “You’re welcome.”
While the show was a coming-out party of sorts for a program still in its infancy, the show reiterated what most already knew — these kids are talented. Although most are still only 18 years old, they are playing with extracurricular bands, recording with top industry names and are already on their own individual paths to successful careers in music. And as acceptance letters for those who will make up the second popular music performance class begin to go out in the next month, Sampson assured everyone that the future looks bright.
“The sky’s the limit,” he said.

On March 4, we will witness the next great battle for public education in California as tens of thousands of students, faculty and workers across the state go on strike to demonstrate their rejection of the state’s attempts to impose massive cutbacks and fee hikes on public institutions of higher learning. For the sake of California higher education, it is vital that their voices are heard.

Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
The trouble has been brewing for months. Last fall, the University of California Board of Regents agreed to a 32 percent fee hike for UC undergraduate tuition statewide in order to help close an $813 million hole in the UC budget, on top of a 9.3 percent tuition hike agreed upon only a few months before.
The issue, however, goes back much further, as the fee hikes represent a 300 percent increase over the last decade. Given that the gross domestic product per capita in California has not increased even 40 percent in the last decade, the size of the fee hikes makes a mockery of the idea that anyone calling the shots intends for public education to remain affordable to the general public any longer. As the California Coordinating Committee asserts, “education cuts are attacks against all of us, particularly in working-class communities and communities of color.”
If anything, the fee hikes represent a sustained attack on the part of our legislators to limit the access of the working class to public universities. The side effect of this campaign is that middle-class households will have to take out more loans than ever to afford what was intended to be an affordable education for all Californians, subsidized through the taxes of all residents of the Golden State.
California legislators eagerly point to the global recession as a cause of the problem, correctly identifying one of the short term causes that has led to the budget crunch we find ourselves in. But it is ignoble to make this argument while at the same time overlooking the rest of the facts.
In the 2009 state budget, $12.4 billion was allotted to help build more prison cells while at the same time $11 billion was cut from education — this at a time in our state’s history when levels of crime have hit new lows. Instead of supporting education and helping youth get an education, the state is cutting their classes, raising their fees. Is this a good plan for California’s future?
On the national level, meanwhile, our tax dollars are being spent to fund the occupation of two sovereign states, Iraq and Afghanistan, costing this country $1.05 trillion to date. Apparently, the richest country on Earth has enough money to drop bombs from drones but cannot allow its own children to gain a decent education without falling into deep debt.
Students at public institutions across the state and the country are angry, and rightly so. As students of the University of Southern California, we should also be outraged by the decisions the state is making with our tax dollars to deny hundreds of thousands of students their right to a decent public education.
We have chosen not to attend a public institution, but we must still be infuriated that our tax money, meant for the good of this great state and its great people, is being squandered by our shameless officials.
I, for one, will be protesting on March 4th.

Ah, the entitlement mentality. “If we have enough money to enforce the law and preserve the national defense, then SURELY we have enough money to buy ME the free stuff that I want!” Check your priorities, kiddo… buying entitlements for moochers is a luxury — the military and the prisons are necessities.
Here’s a free-market solution: how about instead of providing tax-funded subsidies to these universities, let the state use its money to guarantee student loans for California citizens. The universities will have to charge full price, but if they’re worth it, the students will be able to pay for it. If they can’t perform, then the students will go somewhere better. (WHICH IS FINE.)
I fail to see how this effects Trojans.
California is BROKE
You can “tax the rich” but they will move to lower tax states
Leaving the middle income people (us)  to pay and pay.
 But guess what, middle income jobs are gone, outsourced, and not coming back.
USC will have to rethink its model. We all will.
So UC can “protest” but it’s like getting blood out of a turnip, the turnip is dead!
The economic crisis continues to worsen
See —–thecomingdepression dot blogspot dot com
One solution to UC funding problems:
Make the first 2 years online-only. Student to study at home and save up money for his education, work part or full time, etc
After the student finishes freshman and sophomore year successfully online, then enroll on campus as a junior.
Some students in certain majors can successfully complete an entire BA online, whilst also working in or close to  their field of study.
If you research the UC system, you will find that it is full of huge salaries and bloat at all levels. Remember at UC Santa Cruz where the Chancellor hired her own  partner at a huge salary?
Do your research about where the money goes in that system and you will be amazed.
The salaries, benefits, retirement pay, etc is astronomical.
I believe that UC Santa Cruz Chancellor committed suicide after she gained self-realization that she was in the wrong for abusing her position and perquisites. Yeah, she even had some frivolous “playground” built for her dog or something…At least she demonstrated her moral consciousness.
btw, your solution below is practical yet humorous.
I would like to see the article “Public school PROTEST affects Trojans, too” be published after March 4th.
If the protesters get their way and the State of California continues to spend billions of dollars that it doesn’t have, it will much more adversely affect Trojans than what the author lists in this opinion. California’s collapsing credit rating and looming insolvency seems scarier than people paying more for their already taxpayer-subsidized education.

USC constantly strives to keep ahead of the curve, maintaining its tradition of being among the most elite, innovative campuses with the best facilities and services.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
From the up-and-coming Ronald Tutor Campus Center — equipped with big name restaurants, a lounge, volunteer center, radio station and even a bar — to the brand-new University Gateway Apartments — with amenities that include a community kitchen, 24-hour concierge, resident club with Wii and rooftop terraces and a swanky new cinema building — it looks like the area around USC is greatly improving the next year.
But one area is severely lacking: the gym.
Many students ask everyday as they wait in line for a shoddy elliptical, “Why is it that the Lyon Center is such a glaring exception to USC’s impressive facilities?”
With a tuition bill of about $36,000 annually, top-of-the-line equipment in a spacious, modern building is expected here  and is a reality at many schools that charge less than half USC’s bill.
In fact, Ohio State University, where yearly tuition averages less than $8,500, is home to state-of-the-art recreation facilities, including the Adventure Recreation Center (ARC). According to the facility’s website, ARC boasts two indoor turf fields, in addition to an abundance of free weights, strength-training machines and cardio equipment, individual shower facilities. The ARC also houses the Outdoor Adventure Center (OAC), home to the Tom W. Davis Climbing Center, with a 4,000-square-foot, 35-foot tall climbing structure and bouldering cave.
Why can’t $8,000 of my tuition go toward a rock-climbing wall?
Okay, maybe Ohio State’s facilities are a little excessive, but it just goes to show how much we are missing at the Lyon Center, even after the university added more machines on the second floor in 2008, replacing a basketball court.
“I feel like every time I’ve gone there I’ve had to wait in line, even after they revamped it,” said Sarah Noel, a junior majoring in business administration. She decided to join a separate gym, Gold’s Gym, rather than battle the school facilities. “I just felt like it was overcrowded, so it was easier to go down the street to my own gym, although it sucks that I have to do that.”
It is promising that USC listened to student complaints in the past and created the new level, adding several more elliptical, bike machines to some already existing free weights and strength machines. However, only so much can be done with a small amount of space.
The real solution would be a new, larger building, as the cost of additional machines is surely not the limiting factor but rather a lack of space for them is. This of course calls into question where the building would go and who would fund such a large project. If only Mr. Tutor had a friend who is exceedingly passionate about fitness.
Still, it’s not that USC doesn’t have the money but that it has chosen not to spend its cash on undergraduate recreation. Not only is our facility lacking in space, but the upkeep of the machines is also a major issue. The elliptical machines appear fancy with their personal TVs until you realize  only one in every three functions properly. And pickup basketball teams rarely have open courts to themselves — especially during intramural league nights.
Meanwhile, everyone is aware of the lavish facilities provided to the varsity athletes, though few ever get a chance to see them.
Should our athletes, who make up less than 5 percent of the student body, really have such extraordinary facilities when the rest of the 18,073-person student body waits in line for 15 ellipticals (assuming they are all in working condition)?
Don’t get me wrong, we all love and support our athletes, and wouldn’t want to take anything away from a program that’s contributing to their success. But if their gym and equipment is at such a high level, ours could use a little love.
“I feel that [USC] could put more money into the weight room at the Lyon Center. I think they put in the minimal amount they could to make it work,” said William Simon, an undeclared redshirt freshman on the water polo team.
Simon notes that the gym has “bad ventilation, few machines and [is] too crowded.” He even admits that non-varsity students deserve better. “They’re paying for it. Sometimes we had to lift in there, and it sucked,” he said.
With so many student complaints, it seems obvious that it’s time for USC to step up the recreation facilities. With improvements in nearly every other aspect on campus, and an impressive dedication to improving student life based on feedback, it’s surprising the Lyon Center was somehow left out of the university’s grand plans.

A UC San Diego student, whose name has not been released and whose motive is unidentified, has been suspended from the university after admitting Friday to hanging a rope noose from a bookcase in the campus’ main library.
If done with “intent to terrorize,” hanging a noose is considered a misdemeanor under state law.
If convicted, the student could face up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.
UC San Diego Chancellor Marye Anne Fox condemned the incident at an on-campus protest rally.
Students angered by the incident stormed Fox’s office after the rally, occupying it for about six hours. They claimed that recent events have proved that the campus is hostile to African-Americans, noting that just 1.6% of the university’s undergraduate body is made up of blacks, according to the LA Times.
The student responsible for the noose has apologized, according to the Los Angeles Times. She said the act was not meant to be malicious.
The university, however, is continuing its investigation.
“Whatever the intent of the authors of this act, it was a despicable expression of racial hatred, and we are outraged. It has no place in civilized society and it will not be tolerated — not on this particular campus, not on any University of California campus,” UC President Mark G. Yudof and Board of Regents Chairman Russell Gould said in a statement that also promised punishment, according to the Times.

Sundance Channel’s new show, Be Good Johnny Weir, showed the premiere of its fifth episode last night, where Weir goes to Russia to compete in his first competition since nationals 10 months prior.
Since I didn’t want to ruin my Olympics viewing experience, I had decided to wait until the winter games were over to bury myself in the show.
The Cup of Russia was Weir’s chance to kick off the skating season with an impressive showing, but the self-described pop star on ice (spoiler alert!) lost to Evgeni Plushenko, whose first performance in four years defied all expectations.
Because we already know how this rivalry plays out at the Vancouver Olympics, some of the competitive thrill is gone. Weir’s inability to hold it down under pressure rears its ugly head and his loss is predictable instead of disappointing.
Although his strict Russian coach Galina would beg to differ, this is a positive thing as it allows the viewer to enjoy on the real focus of the show — Weir and his flamboyant, outspoken personality.
Outside of the pressures of competition, we are able to see Weir as a real person with a sense of humor, an obsession with Slavic culture and mink bow ties. It resembles what I would imagine a joint reality show with Christian Siriano, Bobby Trendy and Jeffree Star would be like if they were all semi-real people instead of egos wrapped in mannequin bodies.
Weir’s covert sexual innuendos (“When I got my flu shot, they had to stick this mammoth thing inside me”) and admittance of fears and weaknesses (“My jumps were terrible. I’m so embarrassed”) brings him back down from whatever fur-covered planet he appeared to live on during the Olympics and makes him someone you at least want to go shopping with.

A week of successes across the board only got better for the USC women’s water polo team, as two of the Women of Troy were awarded with Mountain Pacific Sports Federation accolades on Monday.
Senior two-meter Kami Craig was named the MPSF Player of the Week for her outstanding play during the Women of Troy’s five victories during this past week.
Craig scored a combined eight goals during the five-game stretch, which also helped her move into tenth place on the USC all-time scoring list for women’s water polo. Craig eclipsed former Trojan and Olympian Lauren Wenger and now has 132 career goals for the Women of Troy (11-1, 1-0).
Craig was especially important during the Women of Troy’s final match of last weekend, against Stanford, in which the senior scored two important goals that helped USC avenge an early season loss to the Cardinal.
The Women of Troy’s leading scorer from the final game of the UC Irvine Invitational against Stanford was freshman two-meter Patricia Jansco, who was awarded with a new honor on Monday — the MPSF Newcomer of the Week, an award given to the conference’s best first-year player of the week.
Jansco scored nine goals during the Women of Troy’s five games in four days and has been integral in the team’s current nine-game winning streak. Jansco scored in all five of the victories, but kept her best performance for last — a hat trick performance against the Cardinal late Sunday night.
The Women of Troy will next hit the pool against California this Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium at 1 p.m.

As Undergraduate Student Government President Holden Slusher and Vice President Ashlie Chan begin their last month in office, they hope to pass on projects they have started to the new administration and assist in the transition to a new administration and location.
Final days · USG President Holden Slusher plans to use his final weeks in office to focus on making the transition as easy as possible. - Daily Trojan File Photo 
In that time, Slusher and Chan will put on USG’s Council of Presidents, hold one last promotional event and primarily focus on transitioning.
“I just really, really want none of the projects that [we] started to fall off the map,” Slusher said. “It’s not just like a Slusher-Chan thing, and then they’re done. We do USG projects because students want it and that’s what should drive the change.”
Slusher did express some disappointment in being unable to accomplish certain projects he had hoped to. Among others, Slusher and Chan hoped to extend the hours at the Lyon Center and also increase safety in the libraries.
“You get to start a lot of projects, but you’re lucky if you finish a couple,” Slusher said.
Though these ideas did not come to fruition, Slusher hopes the projects will continue with the next administration.
One of their main focuses in their final weeks in office, Chan said, will be preparing the whole USG operation for its move to the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center. In the new location, USG will share a space with Program Board, which has had its own space in the past.
“It’s going to be bit of an effort to transition to working together because we each have our different working areas and we have our different ways of functioning,” Chan said. “We have to figure out how to allocate space and materials.”
Slusher said they will be working not just on transitioning to the new building but also on transitioning to a new administration. Slusher and Chan will work with President-elect Chris Cheng and Vice President-elect Nehi Ogbevoen as they pick their executives and cabinet and begin to select their projects for next year.
Slusher has taken notes on all the meetings with his opinions on how certain projects went and also detailing what happened. He is hoping these notes will assist the next administration in pushing forward some of the projects Slusher and Chan were not able to complete and will help give Cheng and Ogbevoen a head start as they enter their new jobs.
“The president has such a macro-perspective on the organization,” Slusher said. “I want Chris to feel empowered by me, so he’s aware not necessarily of the mistakes we made but so that he knows about something before he does them.”
USG Treasurer Ashwin Appiah also said he agrees it would be to the next administration’s benefit to look at what Slusher and Chan had done and move forward.
“One of the few things, especially during a transition, is to look at what the past administration did and work off of that,” Appiah said. “And a lot of times people don’t do that; they just disregard the past and they just start anew.”
With the transition to the new administration, Slusher and Chan are also currently in the process of determining which projects should be continued and which projects should be dismissed because of lack of support or feasibility issues. The projects chosen will be passed on to Cheng and Ogbevoen.
“We have to compile all the research for each project,” Chan said. “We have to make sure everything is up to date.”
One aspect of their administration that Slusher and Chan hope future administrations will continue is being connected to students and getting feedback from them.
“We want to make sure our outreach efforts do not end,” Slusher said. “We want everyone to know what we’re doing.”
To continue USG’s outreach efforts, Appiah is holding office hours so that students can come in and learn more about USG’s budget and where their money goes. The hours have not yet been determined, but they will be held biweekly.
Chan said she expects the next administration will run into many of the roadblocks that her administration ran into but encourages the new president and vice president to look at the “big picture.”
“I think it’s going to be very interesting because there are going to be a lot of new distractions; for example, the move to the new student center,” Chan said. “It’s important to not get bogged down by the details and take things one day at a time.”
Slusher said he credits what he feels is a successful year not just to the executive body but to the students and the administration.
“USG has had so many great successes not just because of the executive body of the organization but simply because we were blessed,” Slusher said.

The housing market at USC is about to get bigger with the imminent completion of University Gateway Apartments, and, though most other local housing companies say they don’t see much cause for worry, some are growing concerned.
Construction of University Gateway, a brand-new apartment complex on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street that will house more than 1,600 students, began in spring 2008 when Urban Partners LLC saw the opportunity to expand the housing offerings around USC.
Before beginning the plans for the building, Urban Partners studied other apartment complexes around campus to determine what worked and what could be improved.
“We’re taking student living to a different level,” said Jason Meno, assistant general manager at University Gateway. “We want to set the bar, so other places will get up to that level.”
University Gateway aims to combine resident life with high-end amenities, offering facilities few other apartment complexes can match.
“I could really see this becoming the wave of the future,” said Daniel Silva, facilities director for University Gateway.
The complex offers both one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, but the one-bedroom rooms have already sold out.
Demand has been very high, according to leasing agent Aven Wright, but there are still some two-bedroom apartments available at a monthly rate of $1,064 per bed for a 12-month lease. The units available are all on the lower floors; the units on higher floors have sold out.
Wright said he thinks University Gateway is a unique concept in the student housing market. 
“We’re completely centered and focused around students,” he said.
Parking is available either on-site for $150 a month or off-site at the USC Parking Center for $37.50 a month. For bikers, there are 800 bike-rack slots located in the garage.
The first floor of the building will be home to 16 different retail spaces. While the specifics haven’t been confirmed yet, Meno said University Gateway would like to have a yogurt shop, coffee shop, bank and pharmacy.
With Gateway’s launch around the corner, some other rental companies around campus are wary.
“We’re small, so we’re definitely concerned,” said Anthony Ramirez, assistant manager at Moraga Student Housing. “We have seen some dwindling in the numbers. I think this year we’re OK, but next year it’ll be worse once Gateway gets more established.”
Ramirez noted, however, that renting a house in the local area could be a more cost-efficient option.
Still, some other vendors said they don’t view Gateway as a threat.
“University Gateway appeals to a certain kind of student,” said Rebecca Slivka, director of marketing and leasing at STUHO Student Housing. “Our market is a little different. We have huge price variations, and we can accommodate most students financially.”
Shahid Nazir, manager at Nupac Apartments, echoed this sentiment.
“We are not in competition with [University Gateway]; they’re catering to wealthier students, and we’re mostly renting to international students,” he said.
Students are intrigued by what Gateway offers, but many say the cost will keep them away.
“We definitely need more housing, especially if [University Gateway] is going to have resources that we can actually use, like the shops,” said Mara Ragan, a sophomore majoring in communication. “It’s so expensive though, so I wouldn’t live there.”
Scott Cummings, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, agreed.
“I definitely think USC needs something like this,” Cummings said. He noted that there was nothing like Gateway in the immediate vicinity to campus but that it seemed too expensive.
Students who have already signed leases with University Gateway, however, are excited at the chance to try out a new kind of living experience.
“I’m living there next year because it’s much better than the other apartments around campus,” said Sarah Ames, a freshman majoring in performance popular music. “They’re pretty old, and [University Gateway] is brand-new. It’s really safe, and it has a gym, shops and a lot of other benefits right on-site.”

Members of USC’s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Center for Scholarly Technology met Friday to discuss ideas to help transform and upgrade USC’s classrooms and auditoriums.
CET and CST are working on a five-year initiative to improve USC’s learning spaces. Those spearheading the initiative hope to make USC’s campus more tech-friendly by updating the technologies and infrastructure in spaces around campus.
The first phase of the initiative involves updating the classrooms and auditoriums to meet the same standards — all rooms will have media boxes and projectors. This phase will be completed by fall 2010.
By this summer, all three computing centers at USC — King Hall, Salvatori Computer Science Center and Waite Phillips Hall — will be renovated along with 50 classrooms and two auditoriums, Montgomery Ross Fisher Building 340 and WPH B27.
The auditoriums will be equipped with media boxes, projectors and computers.
“This is a big movement in higher education IT,” said Joseph Cevetello, director of Learning Environments and Technology-Enhanced Learning, who is in charge of the initiative and works with CET.
Beyond the initial changes, much of the plan is still being developed, and concrete actions have not been decided.
Faculty and students discussed the initiative, “USC Learning Environments Initiative: People, Processes and Places,” on Friday, offering ideas for long-term improvements and focusing on why these enhancements are necessary.
Cevetello said the increase in the use of technology around campus has caused the classroom environment to shift.
“Students really for the first time in history are coming to college campuses with more knowledge of technology, better skills, more powerful technologies in their hands than the average university professor,” Cevetello said. “That affects the dynamic of the classroom because suddenly … students have the advantage.”
He said USC’s classrooms have not evolved at the same rate as the technology students are using.
“The biggest challenge we have in our learning spaces is the lack of technology,” Cevetello said. “The average classroom has one outlet, [while] 85 percent of students have laptops. Our environments don’t support the use of laptop computers.”
The initiative hopes to change how students at USC learn and interact with professors and fellow students on a physical and virtual level.
“The more you can create a classroom that allows a student to interact or collaborate, that takes out the notion that ‘I can just sit here and no one will notice that I’m doing something else,’” said Terry Le, a graduate student studying educational psychology.
Cevetello said there are two main questions this initiative will attempt to address.
“If we are going to meet physically … What should these collaborative spaces look like? Can USC’s existing learning environments support 21st-century learning?” Cevetello said.
The initiative is based on three major factors: predictability, sustainability and flexibility.
“Our first priority for the classrooms … is to create all our classrooms at one level,” Cevetello said. “So that when you, as a faculty member, or you, as a student, walk into a classroom you know what to expect.”
Faculty in the audience raised concerns as to whether new technologies would further encroach on student participation.
Some noted that there are professors who do not allow laptops in their classrooms.
But students in the audience defended the use of technology in the classroom, saying technologies like Twitter, live chats and laptops are more effective and engaging ways to learn.
“In my experience … in college [General Education] classes, the professor was throwing so much information at us that writing down notes is not an effective way of studying or writing down all that information,” said Alexa Hudnet, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering.
Everyone agreed that in the 21st century universities need to adapt to changing technologies.
“USC is serious about making classrooms better for students and faculty alike,” said James Lawford Anderson, CET director.
So far, no price tag has been placed on this initiative, and it has not been determined where the funds to pay for the renovations will come from.

For this first time, the Los Angeles Police Department is pledging to take an active role in protecting bikers’ safety on the streets of Los Angeles.
Rolling · Though LAPD is pushing to enhance bikers’ rights, officials say bikers at USC also need to be sure to observe traffic laws. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
LAPD Chief Charlie Beck announced last week that LAPD will work to heighten awareness of bikers’ rights and regulate officers’ conduct regarding bicycle accidents. The announcement came as a result of growing discontent among bicyclists who want to be able to share the roadways with motorists in a safe manner.
Previously, the officer’s discretion would determine whether an incident between a bike and a car became a collision report or a crime report. LAPD plans to change this policy to include a full, documented report for each collision. The report will be sent to a specific department, which will then determine if the collision was incidental.
LAPD officers will also be better trained in bikers’ safety and rights.
LAPD Cmdr. David R. Doan said the LAPD hopes to create a website where bikers can identify areas in Los Angeles that are particularly problematic.
One area that can be troublesome for both bicyclists and motorists is around USC.
Because all motor vehicles abide by the same California vehicle code, bikers at USC have the same rights as bikers everywhere statewide as well as the same responsibilities.
Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said bicycle collisions often occur because students are not observing traffic laws. Carlisle said he has noticed that many students at USC tend to not yield to pedestrians as is the law.
According to Carlisle, bikers were previously cited at USC for riding bikes on sidewalks and crosswalks, but it is now permissible to ride bikes on both as long as it is done in a safe manner.
Still, the large number of bicyclists in the USC area creates a potential for problems.
“With the proliferation of bicycles in a campus that was not designed for bike traffic, it has created a hazardous situation for bikers and pedestrians,” Carlisle said.
Although most bike accidents are minor and not reported to DPS, there have been more than 60 bicycle-related incidents reported since January 2008, according to Carlisle.
“I’m always afraid I’m going to hit someone … In the areas where it is congested, it’s almost not worth it to have a bike because you have to walk it,” said Roseanna Jamison, a senior majoring in architecture.
Last year, DPS created a bicycle task force, which aims to find solutions for the numerous bikes on campus and how to manage traffic flow. The bike task force is preparing to release a report soon, Carlisle said.
Though campus is crowded with bicyclists, many students find bikes to be a convenient mode of transportation.
“[Biking] is faster and makes it easier to get to class,” said Bryn Kressin, a senior majoring in communication. “I don’t have to wake up as early.”
Though Elizabeth Castro, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, has not been involved in a serious biking accident, she is conscious of how dangerous it can be to bike around USC.
“I always bump into pedestrians, and there’s always the awkward ‘which way are you going?’ kind of thing,” Castro said. “You have to bike really slowly. [Biking around USC] is like a game of Frogger.”
Doan cautioned bicyclists to be aware of the pedestrians around campus.
“Bicyclists share pathways with pedestrians and should remember to maneuver in a manner that is consistent with pedestrians because they rule in these situations,” Doan said.
Ryan Nunez, a senior majoring in communication, does not own a bike but must still face bikers who do not follow the rules of the road.
“[Campus] is a nightmare. Bikers feel that they get the right of way and most of the time they don’t,” he said.
Carlisle cautions pedestrians and drivers on campus to “look left, look right and left again” to prepare for oncoming bicyclists.
GEAH – As fun as it is to bitch about, bikes and stop signs aren’t really an issue. Sure, bikes are treated as vehicles, and theoretically should obey the laws of traffic, but they operate in a manner that is inconsistent with current autocentric infrastructure and legislation. Stop signs are meant to prevent 4,000 lb, 6 ft wide cars from blowing through intersections at 30 mph (assuming a residential 25 mph speed limit), where they can easily kill or maim other pedestrians or drivers. Bicycles weigh ~25 lb plus the weight of the rider, are max 2.5 ft wide, can make significantly faster course adjustments, and top out at 25 mph. A cyclist rolling through an intersection puts only himself at risk (there were a whopping 10 bicycle/pedestrian deaths in the last DECADE), whereas a car running a stop sign poses a significant danger to others. Forcing cyclists to stop at every intersection discourages urban biking, increases congestion (since other cars must stop and wait behind the cyclist, who is slow to accelerate from a full stop), and endangers cyclists, as drivers often don’t see stopped cyclists who are about to enter the intersection. Utah is on the right track in making cyclists treat stop signs as yield signs, and I hope that California will follow suit.
GEAH – When car drivers keep it under the speed limit during their entire trip, get back to me.
USC’s public safety office ought to be focusing on training incoming freshmen in proper cycling technique. The campus PR team should focus on getting the City of LA to make the surrounding community more bike friendly. USC as a commuter campus is a disaster – too many cars flooding the area, not enough benefits of the students spending nearby to justify the costs that residents are shouldered with. Bike-friendliness makes residents and students happier and more productive people – good job LAPD. USC, what is your next move?
When bicyclists stop at all (or even most) stop signs, get back to me.
Yes.  When DPS bicyclists or even DPS motor vehicles stop at most stop signs, get back to me.
I am glad that the LAPD is going to keep an eye on bicyclists to protect them… and everyone else.
I see all too often pedestrians, bicyclist and motorists disregarding laws and common decency by being inconsiderate and dangerous on our streets.

Few students would disagree that USC’s wireless Internet service is due for some fine-tuning, but they might not realize the amount of work and money required to improve wireless coverage.
Connect · Students studying in Leavey Library take advantage of the improved wireless coverage in the library and surrounding area. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan 
In 2006, Information Technology Services began working to improve its wireless coverage, which had been in place since 2002. ITS added almost 1,000 wireless Internet access points to the pre-existing 620, increasing coverage roughly 160 percent.
But those improvements have not satisfied USC students. In fact, every candidate in the recent Undergraduate Student Government election mentioned improving wireless as one of his or her platform points.
“We’ve had enough student feedback to know that there’s an issue, and I think it’s why you saw candidates talking about it in the student government campaigns,” said John Baldo, director of university affairs for USG. “I think everyone kind of agrees it is something we should have. I think ITS is pretty onboard with making sure we have it.”
Newly elected USG president Chris Cheng said USG’s focus for next year will shift toward improving wireless in the residence halls, as many students have complained about the spotty coverage.
“Before the elections, we had a research period where we talked to as many students as possible,” Cheng said. “There really is a high demand for improvement in the residence halls, and in the core academic buildings — Von KleinSmid and Taper Hall, places where a lot of people have their General Education courses.”
Kevin Durkin, director of communications for ITS, said sometimes it is not the number of access points that creates a weak signal but other types of interference, such as microwave ovens or the wire mesh in the walls of buildings.
Cheng stressed that USG is not suggesting that ITS isn’t doing its job in providing wireless to students.
“But in places where the wireless is weak and low, we want to strengthen it,” he said.
Until recently, wireless coverage was inconsistent, even in Leavey Library, a main study spot for both graduate and undergraduate students. Last semester, USG conducted a meticulous survey of Leavey library, measuring signal strength across the building and identifying its weakest points, gathering student feedback and meeting with library staff and ITS Field Services Director Gabe Ochoa.
“John Baldo presented a very comprehensive report,” said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for the USC libraries. “And we’re very glad the student government folks engaged in that because Internet access is an important part of the service we provide at the library.”
The library agreed to add four new access points, and ITS paid for three more. Each new wireless access point costs $900.
“ITS paid for three access points, so we’re very grateful to them for working with us,” Baldo said. “And now we have seven new access points over the second, third and fourth floors [of Leavey], because those are the floors where students are studying the most.”
Next, USG will work to improve the wireless available in common outdoor areas, such as McCarthy Quad.
“With something like this, you have to start somewhere and sort of focus on one area at a time. You can’t just walk in and say, ‘I want every building next week,’ because there’s this huge cost you have to take into consideration,” Baldo said.
Students disagreed as to whether the first step should be improving wireless in the dorms or in common areas.
“I don’t know how it is in different residence halls, but I know that mine doesn’t get wireless,” said Robert Peterson, a sophomore majoring in music industry who lives in Parkside International Residential College.
Peterson said he thinks improving wireless near the dorms will be an asset to students.
Others, however, think wireless in classrooms needs to be the priority.
“I think classrooms should come first. From what I see, I don’t see a lot of people using their laptops outside,” said Esmeralda del Rio, an undecided sophomore. “My sociology professor always has a hard time getting wireless on her laptop when she’s about to show slideshows. It takes her about, like, five minutes. And sometimes, when she wants to use the Internet, she can’t.”
Kimberly Kanable, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering, said she thinks it makes sense to start with classrooms and common spaces, as Ethernet connections are available in the residence halls. 
Baldo said the biggest problem in attempting to improve wireless coverage in any given building is figuring out who is going to cover the cost.
“You know everyone wants perfect wireless in their building, so you can imagine ITS is trying to accommodate what everyone wants, but it’s not really possible when it’s $900 an access point,” Baldo said.
Durkin emphasized ITS is committed to providing the campus with the wireless coverage it increasingly needs.
“ITS recognizes that the increased use of mobile devices — laptops, iPhones, Blackberries and so forth — is driving the demand for improved wireless service, so in response to that we are looking for alternative approaches to providing pervasive, reliable wireless coverage across both campuses. So in other words, stay tuned,” Durkin said.

More than 50 Marshall students planning to spend their spring break meeting with businesses in Santiago, Chile, were told late Sunday night — less than 48 hours after an earthquake shook the country’s coast — that the trip was canceled.
Chile was struck by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake early Saturday morning, killing more than 700 people and displacing more than 2 million residents. The earthquake’s epicenter was southwest of Santiago, Chile’s capital, but the initial earthquake and its aftershocks still caused significant damage.
Santiago fared better than Concepción, another major city located farther south, but the earthquake was powerful enough to leave many people without power, gas or water and to close one of the city’s major bridges and its only airport.
A group of Marshall freshmen was slated to visit Santiago over spring break as part of the school’s Learning about International Commerce Program (LINC). Students in the program take a two-unit class focused on a specific country’s culture and businesses and then visit that country in March or May.
Though most experts believe Santiago will recover quickly, Marshall administrators felt they needed to make a quick decision and, because they can’t be sure the country and its business will be stable in time for spring break, they chose to call off the trip.
“The challenge we have at the moment is that the trip was scheduled to leave a week from Saturday, so we don’t have a long window of time to watch how the situation in Santiago changes,” said Kim West, the associate dean for undergraduate programs at Marshall. “If we were not leaving for four weeks or six weeks, we could take the time to see what the next week or two brings. Unfortunately, we don’t have that time.”
A similar situation arose last year, West said, when terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India precluded travel to the country. In that case, the students were taken instead to Dublin, Ireland.
West said Marshall is currently exploring alternatives for the Chile group, including traveling to a different location in March or rescheduling the Santiago trip for May.
If possible, West said she hopes the students will be able to visit Santiago later in the year. Coordinating this, however, involves communicating with hotels, travel agencies, airlines and the businesses the students were supposed to visit.
“Ideally, we would look at the week after commencement because we actually have three trips going then,” West said. “We might look to just move it to that block and hope it works for most of the students.”
Students who were part of the group headed to Santiago said they are disappointed the program has been canceled but are hopeful that they might get to go later.
Garrett Weiss, a freshman majoring in business administration, said many of the students were actually eager to go to Chile right after the earthquake because of the possibility of assisting with humanitarian efforts.
“Obviously we wouldn’t be going just to do everything we had planned if we went after the earthquake; we’d probably be helping, which everyone was really excited about as well,” Weiss said.
Laura Gardiner, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she was disappointed because the group has spent the whole semester learning about Chile, and they were anxious to visit and apply their knowledge.
“I was disappointed … in the sense that we’ve been learning about Chile, so I’ve been really excited to go to Chile and South America in general,” Gardiner said.
Going to a different location in March would be difficult, as many require specific visas, Gardiner noted, and she said she hopes the trip happens later in the year.
“I’m hoping that the trip is just going to get moved to May, but then the other problem is that people who picked March trips pick them because they can’t go in May,” she said.
Weiss, however, said he is willing to go anywhere Marshall might send him in March.
“It’s kind of exciting to know that we’re going somewhere but have no idea where we’re going,” he said.
West said Marshall hopes to notify students by the end of the week as to what the alternative plan will be.
This would have been the third time students in the LINC program have traveled to Chile.

Students came together Monday to remember Sandy Roberts, a USC student who died Saturday night after a car crash in Kern County, near Bakersfield, Calif.
Remembered · About 150 students gathered at USC Hillel on Monday night for a memorial service in honor of Sandy Roberts, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, who died in a car accident in Kern County Saturday night. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The School of Cinematic Arts and USC Hillel both offered services in honor of Roberts, hoping to give his friends and fellow students a venue to reminisce and grieve.
Roberts, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, was riding in a car driven by Nicole Deane, also a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, when the car lost control and veered into oncoming traffic. Both Deane and Roberts were transported to Kern Medical Center, where Roberts was pronounced dead.
In response to requests from Roberts’ friends, USC Hillel held a memorial service Monday night, inviting the entire USC community.
Roberts participated in FreshFest, an involvement program for Jewish freshmen, and was always a part of USC’s Jewish community, said Cameron Roth, student president of Hillel.
“We’re doing this for his friends,” Roth said. “We wanted to set up a place for them to feel comforted.”
As part of the memorial service, Hillel offered students a chance to read psalms or poetry and to share their stories and memories of Sandy.
Roth said the event was taped, so it could be shared with Roberts’ family.
The School of Cinematic Arts also reached out to students Sunday night, informing them of the accident and offering counseling services. And the school hosted a gathering for students in need of support from their classmates and counselors.
Deane, the car’s driver, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
USC officials encourage anyone affected by Saturday’s accident to contact a counselor at (213) 740-7711.
it is both one of the horrors and one of the beauties of living that life is determined by random moments and circumstance. So many aspects are simply out of our control, and thus this is a tragedy that could have happened to any one of us. Do not seek blame in trying to find the answers- to “blame” Nicole is simply awful and wrong. This is a matter of being human. I have complete love, respect, and adoration for Sandy and Nicole and I am so so sorry that this had to happen at this point in their lives. We will heal, we will continue with our lives and continue to enjoy them but we will continue to love Sandy’s soul and we will never forget him.
Not  just insensitive, but cruel and inaccurate.  Highway 46, where the accident took place, is an extremely dangerous road.  It has been nick-named “Blood Alley” for decades, and getting funds to change and improve it has been a longstanding, contentious issue in the legislature.  Try googling accidents on highway 46 or asking anyone from Kern County and you’ll get the idea.  Simply stated, this is a strip of highway where losing control of a car does not imply the wrecklessness suggested by the original poster.  
The community is coming together to mourn the loss of a wonderful young man and to offer support and comfort to a wonderful young woman seriously injured in a tragic accident.  This is hard enough, and it will take all of our strength, love, empathy and compassion for one another.  Let’s be there for one another.
DJ – as a friend of Nicole’s, I can say that she is as responsible as they come. Can you honestly say you’ve never made a mistake while driving? Maybe it didn’t cost you something incredibly dear to you, but at any point any one of us could make a mistake that changes our lives. I understand and appreciate your concern for the other family, but posting comment that here, when there are so many mourning the loss of someone who was a brother and friend and the love of Nicole’s life… it’s just insensitive. Think before you type.
And to Nicole, or Sandy’s family, or anyone else involved – If you read this, know that all of us here in Nashville are broken-hearted over what has happened, and we’re praying for a return to health for Nicole and healing for all who are affected. I know we all wish we could be by your side to offer support, but sending prayers from Tennessee will have to do for now. We love you.
Wow, DJ, that is really insensitive to put something like that on an article like this.
what about the family who was hit because of the wreckless driving?
Wow DJ, I hope that karma does not take revenge on your next mistake, and I am sure that you have made plenty. These were 2 responsible people, and a very tragic mistake was made. What a simple minded comment.
