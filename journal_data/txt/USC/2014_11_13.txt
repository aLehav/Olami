With the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament in sight, the No. 3 USC men’s water polo team will look to end its regular season on a high note against conference rival No. 5 Cal Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatic Center.

The Trojans enter what will be their regular season finale, home finale and Senior Day coming off two straight wins last week against Long Beach State and UC Irvine. The Trojans and the Golden Bears will vie for the season series advantage in tomorrow’s rubber match, as the two sides are tied 1-1 in their two meetings this year. The Golden Bears edged out the Trojans 11-10 in the third place game of the Kap7 NorCal Classic on Sept. 21, but the Trojans avenged their defeat with a 10-9 victory over the Golden Bears on Oct. 12 in the SoCal Tournament finals.
Having seen the Bears twice already in 2014, the Trojans will combat familiar faces in leading Cal scorers Aleksa Saponjic and Colin Mulcahy, who have compiled 59 and 54 goals, respectively, throughout the year. With Saturday’s contest effectively serving as a prelude to the playoffs, the Trojans strive to be well-studied and well-motivated in these late stages of the season.
“We always try to be the most prepared team with whoever we’re facing and whatever they’re doing,” redshirt junior two-meter Mac Carden said. “We’re going to do it the same way we did last year — keep our heads up [and] finish strong in the season.”
Beyond the regular season Saturday’s game could give the Trojans a spark for the MPSF tournament which, redshirt senior driver Rex Butler said, could be vital to the team’s postseason run.
“It’s looking like things are going to most likely come down to what happens in the conference tournament,” said Butler, who has scored seven goals in the team’s last three games. “It was the same scenario last year — last year, if we didn’t win the conference tournament, we wouldn’t have made it to [the NCAA tournament]. It’s not like we’re feeling a huge amount of pressure right now. It’s something that we’ve been through before as a team. We’re just trying to make sure the young guys are staying confident.”
If the Trojans are able to overcome the Bears again Saturday, they will arrive at the conference tournament with the momentum of a three-game winning streak, and in a spot near-identical to the position they were in at the start of last year’s postseason. A victory would cap USC’s regular season record off at 21-4. Last season, the Trojans began the MPSF tournament with a record of 23-4 and went undefeated in the postseason to clinch their sixth straight NCAA championship.
USC head coach Jovan Vavic is confident his team has the capability of pulling off the same maneuver this year.
“I think that talent-wise, and with everything put into place, we are the best team [in the country],” Vavic said. “We don’t always play like the best team — not for four quarters, which is something we need to work on — but if you look at the first two quarters of our last game against [No. 1] UCLA {Nov. 2], it certainly looks like we’re the better team to me.”
The Trojans’ four seniors — Butler, driver Kostas Genidounias, redshirt two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza and driver Marc Vonderweidt — will be honored at Uytengsu Aquatic Center this Saturday before the team faces Cal at 10:30 a.m. for its last game of the regular season.

After a three-year absence from the NCAA Women’s Soccer Tournament, the USC women’s soccer team is once again headed to the postseason, and will face the No. 4 seed Pepperdine in their first round matchup.
Kickin’ it · Junior Jamie Fink was named an All-Pac-12 honorable mention Tuesday. Fink has six goals for the Women of Troy this season. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy endured a tumultuous regular season, but thanks to a strong start and some impressive non-conference wins, as well as a convincing finish in Pac-12 play, they have fulfilled one of their main goals of getting to the playoffs.
“For them to get us there [the tournament], I think it’s big,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I’m really happy they get to experience this and change the future for the program.”
In McAlpine’s first season as the head of coach of the squad, the Women of Troy are immediately showing progress. A respectable 12-win season and six conference wins have vaulted the team from an 11th-place finish in 2013 to a fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 this season.
The team has looked confident, and the commitment to the style and coaching philosophy that McAlpine and his staff have brought to Southern California has reaped immediate results.
“I’m really proud of the team,” McAlpine said. “We challenged them to continually grow throughout the year, and they’ve done it.”
From the start of the campaign both McAlpine and the team echoed the fact that success would be measured by their ability to make the playoff tournament. Now, their primary goal has been accomplished and they are looking to extend their success for as long as possible.
“Our goal is not over yet,” junior midfielder Jamie Fink said. “The main goal right now is to win an NCAA championship and that’s the next step.”
They will get their chance to take their first step towards that goal against a familiar opponent, when they face the Pepperdine Waves this Saturday afternoon.
The Waves came into their Sept. 21 matchup at McAllister Field bearing a single loss to No. 1 UCLA before facing the then-undefeated Women of Troy. After outshooting the Waves 19-13 throughout the match, the Women of Troy ended up falling by a lone goal, as their relentless second half attack and effort was not enough to net them the equalizer.
Since then, this Pepperdine squad has only lost one of their matches, and overall, they have only been on the losing side once when playing in Malibu during their entire 2014 campaign. Thanks to Pepperdine forward Lynn Williams, who has amassed a total of 12 goals throughout the season, the Lady Waves are outscoring opponents 20-7 since their game against USC.
That match was also a turning point in the opposite direction for the Women of Troy given that their first loss to the Lady Waves began the toughest stretch of their season as they went on to lose four out of the next six games.
But the resilience of this squad that was evident early in the season — such as in South Bend, Indiana when the Women of Troy beat Notre Dame and Iowa State — resurged when they went on to win four of their final five conference matches en route to the tournament berth and this matchup against one of their California neighbors.
For the Women of Troy, the explosive offense that was seen throughout non-conference play could not have come back at a better time. Six goals and four straight wins later, the offense seems to be firing back on all cylinders at the perfect time.
“The experiences we’ve had playing through the conference will help,” McAlpine said. “We’ve played some of the top teams in the country.”
Due in large part to senior midfielder Alex Quincey, whose 10 goals lead the team and whose minutes have increased throughout the season, the offense will play a big role in Saturday’s match. Once again, the Women of Troy will be facing a strong defensive team and being able to finish and score will be key. This time around they hope to find themselves in a superior position rather than in an early deficit compounded with the inability to finish and win.
The Women of Troy certainly have their work cut out for them, but given the display they exhibited against the Waves in that early-season matchup, McAlpine believes a win is within reach.
“There’s some familiarity in this game which gives them some confidence,” McAlpine said. “That will certainly help.”
The mantra this team has adopted will continue on to the postseason, and their focus continues to be on only the game at hand.
“We’re gonna take one game at a time,” Fink said. “But this is also a time to take on revenge and it’s a perfect opportunity for us.”
USC gets its shot at revenge and a coveted ticket to the next round this Saturday at 1 p.m. in Malibu, California.

This weekend, I’m continuing a long-standing tradition.
Please excuse the hyperbole, but treating it with humor is the only way I can make myself feel better about this. I’m headed home for a few days to start what, in all likelihood, will be another basketball season during which I will attend more San Diego State games than USC games.
No Enzone · Men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield wants to bring excitement to USC, but attendance at the Galen Center is still flagging. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Both of my parents graduated from SDSU and my dad is just about the most intense fan you can imagine. Over the course of three seasons (2009-2011), he attended 104 of 105 games — both home and away.
Because of him, I grew up watching San Diego State basketball, and I must admit I got spoiled. The Aztecs continued to improve over the years, at one point climbing to No. 4 in the nation, and as they improved, they developed a pretty incredible fan base.
San Diego State’s student section, which shows up in huge numbers to every game, calls itself “The Show,” and they’re a ridiculous group of people. They hold up newspapers when the opposing starting lineup is being announced, then crumple them up and throw them in the air when the lights go out before the Aztecs’ starting five come out. They get the whole stadium to participate in the “I believe that we will win” chant. They wave around signs with weird celebrities’ faces on them during opponents’ free throws. One guy used to always dress in a banana suit. It’s just wild.
On Twitter, The Show has 8,558 followers and describes itself as follows: “The San Diego State Student Section. Often imitated, never duplicated. You won’t like us. We don’t care.”
Guess how many followers USC’s basketball student section, “The Enzone,” has on Twitter? If you guessed a measly 340, you were right. What’s perhaps worse than that is that The Show has more than twice as many followers as USC’s actual men’s basketball Twitter page (4,131), which really goes to show how little we value basketball here at USC.
I can’t really blame our students for not going to basketball games. The team went 11-21 last year and finished dead last in the conference, which is certainly not fun to watch. But — and this isn’t rocket science — maybe if more students showed up, the team would be more successful. This idea might hold more weight in basketball than in any other sport, with the close quarters and ability for players and fans to interact. USC averaged just 4,370 people in attendance through its 16 home games last year. That’s less than half the capacity of the Galen Center.
But me sitting here preaching about going to basketball games is hypocritical. I personally didn’t go to a single game last season. In my defense, they played a lot of Wednesday and Thursday night games, when I was stuck in the Daily Trojan office laying out pages. And the one time I got close to going, I was coming from work and they wouldn’t let me in because of my backpack.
But I’ll get off of my pedestal when talking about USC’s men’s basketball games, because like I said, I’ll be down in San Diego this weekend watching the Aztecs play Cal State Northridge rather than watching our Trojans host Portland State in their home opener on Saturday night.
I’d argue that USC’s miniscule student section at basketball games is a microcosm for the school’s whole fan base. This year, I’ve come to a sad realization that I’ve been trying to fight off my whole time here: USC’s fans just aren’t that impressive.
During the few football games I’ve covered from the press box, I’ve stared across the Coliseum at the student section as it thins out to half its amount by halftime. About a week ago, Scott Wolf of L.A. Daily News reported that USC returned about 4,000 of its 15,000 tickets allotted for the Trojans’ game against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 22 because they went unclaimed.
I understand that the Trojans have disappointed some fans this season by losing three games that most can agree they could have and should have won, but true fans should stick by their team. When I decided to come to USC, I fully bought into the idea that USC was a football school. Since I’ve been here, fewer and fewer students have truly embraced that idea, and I’d love to see that change.
I’d love people all over the country to consider USC’s student section a formidable one. It shouldn’t even be a conversation. USC has one of the best athletic programs of all time, across the board (the Trojans just won their 100th NCAA championship in May). I urge those who call themselves a part of the Trojan Family to make an effort this year.
Go to all the remaining football games. Stay the whole time. Head out to the Galen Center for men’s and women’s basketball and women’s volleyball. Try to catch USC’s six-time defending national champion men’s water polo team play at home for the last time this season on Saturday. Make USC proud.

Junior wideout Nelson Agholor became the first player in USC history with consecutive 200-yard receiving games and redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler added four touchdowns to his season total in an ugly, penalty-filled 38-30 win over Cal on Thursday night.
The Trojans (7-3, 6-2 Pac-12) jumped out to a 31-2 lead midway through the second quarter behind the Kessler-to-Agholor connection, but could not close out the resilient Golden Bears (5-5, 3-5).
Cal quarterback Jared Goff found wide receiver Stephen Anderson for a 29-yard touchdown with just 1:36 remaining, cutting the Trojans’ lead to eight. The Bears’ dreams of a remarkable comeback came to end, however, when James Langford’s onside kick landed in the waiting arms of USC sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers. The Trojans proceeded to run out the clock, surviving another disastrous second half performance.
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian recognized that his team dodged a bullet against a tough Cal squad, but refused to admit that his team suffered a second half letdown.
“We knew all along that their offense would start clicking,” Sarkisian said. “I wish we would’ve performed a little better in the red zone. We left some points on the board and we have the ability to play better. But I don’t think we let down.”
Agholor, who finished with 16 reception for 216 yards and two touchdowns, downplayed his monster night.
“My job is just to get open,” Agholor said. “Coach called great plays and Cody [Kessler] gave me opportunities.”
Sarkisian was straightforward in his praise of Agholor.
“When you practice well, the results show up on game day,” Sarkisian said. “This guy practices his tail off. The first day back after the Washington State game, he was out on the Jugs machine catching balls. Work ethic pays off.”
Though they managed just seven points in the final 31 minutes of the game, the Trojans looked unstoppable out of the gate. The offense got on the scoreboard immediately, driving 85 yards on their opening possession for the game’s first touchdown. Fittingly, the drive ended on a 10-yard strike from Kessler to Agholor.
After a Cal three-and-out, USC was back in the endzone in a flash. Two quick outs to Agholor set up Kessler’s second score, a 32-yard play action bomb to speedy junior wideout George Farmer.
Agholor pulled down another touchdown midway through the second quarter, a 10-yard missile set up by a forced fumble from sophomore safety Leon McQuay III. On the ensuing possession, Bears’ head coach Sonny Dykes dialed up a disastrous fake punt, allowing USC to take over with excellent field position. Unsurprisingly, Kessler and the Trojans cashed in, extending their lead to 29 after a chip shot field goal from senior kicker Andre Heidari.
Though the Trojans’ offense will get the recognition for a dominant first half, it was the team’s defense that set the tone. Goff, who came into the game averaging 346.6 pass yards per game, was held to just 96 yards in the first 30 minutes of the game.
As should be expected in the wild Pac-12 conference, the Bears refused to go quietly. Goff led a nine-play, 60-yard scoring drive just before halftime, cutting USC’s lead to 31-9.
The Trojan defense continued to falter for the rest of the contest, first allowing an 11-play, 79-yard drive on Cal’s second possession of the third quarter that culminated in a five-yard touchdown from running back Daniel Lasco.
As the much-maligned Pac-12 referees slowed the game’s pace down to a crawl in the final quarter, USC senior tight end Randall Telfer attempted to put the game out of reach with a 16-yard touchdown grab. Kessler, who expertly avoided the Cal pass rush and scrambled to his right to find Telfer, was flagged for taunting after the play. The Trojans accumulated 14 penalties over the course of the game, for a total of 159 yards. Sarkisian hinted that he was unhappy with the officials after the game.
“I’m gonna refrain from getting a fine,” the first-year coach said.
The Bears added another score midway through the fourth, cutting the gap to 38-23. USC then punted with less than four minutes remaining, setting up Cal’s last scoring drive.
Even after the late-game drama, Sarkisian was adamant that he will accept any win, regardless of the circumstances.
“We played a really good football game,” Sarkisian said. “all in all its a really good win in November. The goal is to be 4-0 in November, and we’re on track to do that.”
The Trojans will take the field again next Saturday, when they head across town to face archrival UCLA at the Rose Bowl.
 
Quick Hits
Heidari’s second-quarter field goal marked the first time all season that the Trojans were unable to score a touchdown in a goal-to-go situation.
USC racked up eight penalties in the first half alone, totaling 85 yards.
Kessler finished 31-42 with 371 yards. After a career-high 400-yard performance against Washington State on Nov. 1, this game marks the first time Kessler has thrown for 300-plus yards in consecutive contest.
Telfer’s touchdown was his first of the season and the 11th of his USC career.
Notable Trojan supporters in attendance included former quarterback Matt Leinart, actor Adam Sandler and recording artist Miley Cyrus.
 
Fire Mike Rae’s caddy first!
Will,
Sarkisian is delusional or he needs to watch the game again. For him to deny a second half meltdown is ridiculous. This is becoming classic USC football with him. Start strong in the fist half and let teams catch up, ranked or not, in the second half. I have watched game after game where USC blows the lead and allows it to get within a field goal or touchdown. Certainly you have seen the ugly losses that happened that shouldn’t have happened. I think Sark will have his butt on the line if he bombs the next two games. Sure Haden may not boot him yet, but the conversation will start when the style of wins doesn’t change. It’s not enough to simply win. There needs to be convincing wins because if it stays like this, ugly losses will be customary every year. Sark will be lucky to get a “W” against two ranked teams who have clearly done better than USC so far this year.

Undergraduate Student Government is leading tours of Leavey Library during Trojan Family Weekend to showcase the new renovations to the library and to raise awareness about the improvements that USG would like to see completed in the future.
Sightseeing · Eric Miller, Assistant Director for Academic Affairs for Undergraduate Student Government, speaks to a parent on the tour. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
“It’s so automatic to say, ‘This is where I’m living,’ ‘These are my friends,’ but parents don’t necessarily know where their kids are studying,” said USG Assistant Director for Academic Affairs Eric Miller.
The tours, offered on Thursday and Friday, are a part of USG’s ongoing initiative to update and renovate Leavey. Last December, USG surveyed students about what changes they would like to see made to the library, and over the summer they were able to collaborate with administration to renovate the basement and first floor, along with adding seating to the patio.
According to USG Vice President Rini Sampath, giving tours of the library during Trojan Family Weekend will not only demonstrate the progress that USG and the administration has made in updating the library, but will also raise awareness about the changes that still need to be made as well as hopefully attract potential donors.
“The purpose is to show our families and parents the current status and appearance of Leavey and will allow individuals to see we are in desperate need of renovation,” Sampath said. “With cooperation from administration, we’ve done some great work with the first floor and renovated the basement, but we’re ready to move on to the next floors.”
Tours started on the third floor to show families areas of the library that USG hopes to improve in the future. On the tour, USG Director for Academic Affairs Nicole Schrad and Miller highlighted seating that students have said is uncomfortable and the wall color that students would like to see updated. On the second floor, Schrad and Miller explained to parents that removing the large computer desk carousels, something that has already been done in the basement, would create room for additional seating.
Throughout the tour, parents expressed their understanding of students’ desire to update the library.
“I think it’s important to update and renovate the space to accommodate new technology and to update the learning environment,” said parent Cathy Kennerson. “Also, as time goes on, color schemes do change, so it’s important to keep it fresh, which will keep students motivated.”
Families were also given the opportunity to see the first floor and basement, where renovations have already occurred in order to brighten rooms, increase seating and update furniture.
Patty Huber, whose daughter is a sophomore studying environmental science, said she was impressed by the new collaborative study spaces in the basement.
“I’m definitely going to talk to my daughter about the group study areas in the basement because I don’t know if she knows it’s available, and I think it’s something she should take advantage of,” Huber said.
Through showcasing the renovations at Leavey, parents can see their tuition dollars at work, according to Schrad.
“I think for parents who are helping to send their kids to school by paying tuition, it’s awesome to see how the administration supports students,” Schrad said. “The renovations are really cool and a nice way to see how the university does care about students and is trying to support them.”
Future plans to update the library include repainting and refurnishing the interior of the second and third floors. Miller said USG explored a renovation option that would involve stripping the majority of the building’s interior; however, Miller said that they opted for a plan that would be less expensive and could be completed sooner.
“Realistically we want to provide Leavey as a resource to students now, so we’re focusing our efforts on changes we can make quickly,” Miller said.
One tour took place on Thursday and two more are scheduled for Friday.

The Interfraternity Council canceled their scheduled tailgates in Exposition Park on Thursday prior to the football game against the University of California, Berkeley.
Tailgating for the Thursday night game is prohibited on campus and The Row.
“There was a miscommunication between the university and IFC as to what the tailgating situation would be like,” said IFC President Tanner Sandoval. “We made an agreement after last semester to work with [the university] to find a space that works for us. We were dealing with where we were going to put 4,000 people before the game.”
The university could not be reached for comment. Administrators have previously said that they hoped creating space for tailgates near the Coliseum would make it easier for students to comply with on-campus tailgating restrictions for Thursday night football games.
According to Sandoval, the area in Exposition Park that was initially reserved for the fraternities’ tailgate did not allow alcohol to be served. Sandoval said IFC found a new space two weeks ago in the park but needed to hire security in order for alcohol to be served. The security company that is contracted by the city of Los Angeles to work in the park, however, was already fully booked for the tailgate sponsored by the Undergraduate Student Government and another event.
Sandoval said the event still could have been held but alcohol would not have been able to be served.
“With the cost of the space, it wouldn’t have been worth it,” Sandoval said.
Sandoval said individual fraternities would be responsible for finding their own tailgate locations, though he could not guarantee that they would comply with restrictions to tailgating on The Row.
“Whether or not they all comply, especially considering the circumstance with Expo Park, I can’t say,” he said.

The USC Shoah Foundation’s IWitness program has recently taken its first steps beyond secondary school classrooms, experimenting with multimedia history lessons for students as young as fifth graders.

IWitness is an educational website that is part of USC Shoah’s Institute for Visual History and Education. It allows teachers to choose from more than 1,000 testimonies of Holocaust survivors and other genocide victims to show their students. This pilot activity in schools, they hope, will help the organization learn how best to teach students about issues like prejudice and tolerance at a younger age.
“We are in a piloting stage — we have to think carefully about the developmental needs of students,” said Claudia Wiedeman, associate director for educational technologies and training. “Through systematic research, we have inquired with our users to see what they would like in IWitness.”
Only one elementary school, O. A. Thorp Scholastic Academy in Chicago, has used IWitness in its pilot program so far, but surveys and focus groups following the class’ completion of the project will help to determine what students have learned and to improve future projects over the next few months. Since IWitness has been used by high schools in every U.S. state and 58 other countries, the organization has a good idea about how younger students will respond to it.
“You’re not going to use the entire testimony — you’re going to use different clips to accent a topic or theme. [IWitness] can certainly be used at all grade levels if you’re careful about which clips you select,” said Lesly Culp, who now works for USC Shoah but previously taught high school students using IWitness testimonies.
Culp found that her students were very interested in the testimonies, learning background information about the survivors first and writing about what they learned after.
“Talking to students about testimonies, they always wanted to watch more and hear the full stories,” Culp said. “They were able to write intelligently about them, much better than they had written before.”
Though the students spent only a portion of their class times watching these testimonies, Culp found that the audio-visual component helped the stories resonate in students’ minds.
“It always gave them a different perspective from reading memoirs and short stories,” she said. “The comment was always, ‘I felt like it was my grandparent or aunt,’ and I think all people can resound to that.”
Wiedeman said that IWitness’ extension to primary schools reflects its mission to not only expand geographically, but to also continue allowing their archive to educate more students.
“We have years of information about [IWitness] use across the U.S., but this is a focus on primary education,” Wiedeman said. “That’s what the pilot was all about last week — to learn from the students and the teacher what would fit best, how to implement it, how to preface it. Developing additional content and strategy is something we want to do and will continue to explore.”
Shoah stressed the importance of teaching students about prejudice at a young age, and the organization believes that children are influenced by others’ opinions and actions early on. Once the program is fully developed for younger classrooms, Shoah hopes, these students will gain a positive and influential learning experience from IWitness testimonies.
“The power that we have to teach and to affect change is enormous,” Wiedeman said. “It’s seeing this platform being used across the world to get kids to think beyond themselves — that keeps us energized around here.”

More than two months after admitting that the story that made him famous was a lie, senior cornerback Josh Shaw has gone on the record to explain what happened the night he suffered two sprained ankles.
Coming clean · Josh Shaw, a senior cornerback on the USC football team, admitted to lying to his coach and the media about how he suffered two injured ankles in an interview with Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
On Aug. 25, USC released a story explaining that the co-captain of the football team had sustained two high ankle sprains after jumping off a balcony at a cousin’s apartment in Palmdale, California, in an attempt to save his nephew from drowning in the pool below.
On Thursday, Shaw admitted to Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times that he did not sprain his ankles saving his nephew, but rather after getting in a loud argument with his longtime girlfriend at her apartment, which prompted neighbors to call the police.
Though both Shaw and his girlfriend, Angela Chilton, insist that the argument never escalated to physical violence, he still decided to flee from the police out of fear after his girlfriend left her apartment, while he remained inside.
“We were not on good terms when she left, I thought she had somebody call authorities. I was thinking the worst,” Shaw told Plaschke. “If she did say anything, I’m a black man with dreadlocks, and with everything going on in the country at the time, all that stuff in St. Louis [Ferguson, Mo.] … in my mind, I’m going to leap from the balcony so authorities did not see me.”
Shaw said when he jumped and landed on a grassy patch on Figueroa Street, he immediately felt pain shoot up both his legs, and feared he had broken them. Thinking he had surely ruined his season before it began, Shaw felt he needed a good excuse to tell his coaches.
“I wanted to come up with something that they would say, ‘Josh, if you got hurt, that’s a good reason to get hurt,’” he told Plaschke. “That’s where fabrication came in.”
After USC’s sports information department sat down with Shaw to vet the story, they released it to the public, and it immediately picked up national attention. Shaw was lauded for his heroism on every major news outlet, including ESPN and Fox Sports 1, who named Shaw their “Best Person in Sports” the day the story broke.
When rumors started to swirl about the story not being true, national media criticized USC for breaking the story on its own, and started to question the validity of schools’ sports information departments. But USC’s head sports information director, Tim Tessalone, insisted that the school needed to explain Shaw’s absence and took the necessary steps to vet the story.
“We have our starting cornerback being carted around campus in a wheelchair, people would be seeing it,” Tessalone told Plaschke. “We knew it was a feel-good story, but we also knew it was a news story.”
Shaw knew he had to come clean when he saw his lie broadcast on national television, but was afraid of the consequences. After gathering his family to explain what he had done, Shaw finally met with USC officials on Wednesday, Aug. 27 to explain that he had fabricated his heroic actions. The school announced that he lied and would be suspended indefinitely, but never disclosed the true cause of his injuries.
Shaw, who racked up 67 tackles and four interceptions last year, will be suspended until he is formally absolved of wrongdoing by prosecutors and by USC’s own investigators. The Trojans only have two games left this season, and it remains to be seen whether Shaw will ever come back and play another game for the Trojans.

In a city full of hot and new restaurants popping up on every happening corner, brand identity is often what sets the successful apart from the rest. How hot is your geotag on Instagram? Cult favorite Umami Burger takes this idea to heart: one of their most popular locations in Santa Monica has no outside insignia and is only discoverable by those in the know. Different up and coming restaurants distinguish themselves in a variety of ways, logos on food at Umami, highlighting local sourcing at places like Mendocino Farms, etc.
Order up · Plan Check’s specialty is its burgers. The Bleuprint burger is a particular hit — its blend of blue cheese, pig candy, fried onions, roasted garlic steak sauce and peppercress coming together nicely. – Photo courtesy of Plan Check
This is a lesson that new burger chain Plan Check might want to take to heart. Though a diner might be was asked the name of the restaurant repeatedly throughout the course of one night (by their friends, the Uber driver there, the Lyft driver back, and their roommates upon return with leftovers) the name of the dang restaurant will resist to stick in their head. It’s not memorable.
Despite the forgettable combination of nouns by which the gastropub identitifies itself, the food was much more memorable, explaining the sizable following Plan Check has already built.
Their newest location, on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Bixel Street in Downtown,  is already buzzing by 8 p.m., with a small line extending out the door of the open air restaurant. A warm weather favorite, there are no windows and only half walls, allowing passerby to peek in on the hip crowd dining inside. The area was dimly lit and decorated in dark colors, while the menu was hand-written on a chalkboard. The place was trying so hard to be hip that one struggles not to overuse the word hip in this review. A unifying concept to the design and theme were not overtly apparent, but the overall effect was pleasant.
Door greetings were friendly tables are found quickly. This swift service was apparent through the rest of the night: diners are waited on almost immediately, served drinks soon after, and are able to ordered and received their food within 15 minutes, despite the apparent bustle of the restaurant.
The food selection was limited in the best way, not allowing for too much dithering. Yelp recommends the K-BBQ Burger: a $14 creation with grilled pork belly, kimcheese (gruyere + kimchee), sprouting onion, gochujang bbq sauce, sesame salt and fried onions, and it lived up to the amateur food photography on the site. Some might be wary of the kimcheese, if they are not used to the pungent Korean favorite, but the taste was understated and interesting, the highlight of the burger. On a disappointing  note to lovers of sweet-and-sour taste, neither the barbeque sauce nor the flavor of the beef patty itself were sweet enough to counteract the overpowering saltiness of the fried onions, cheese and sesame salt.
The Bleuprint, is the real hit of the menu, with smoked blue cheese, pig candy, fried onions, roasted garlic steak sauce and peppercress. Pig Candy, for the unitiated, is a sugar-crusted thick bacon laid inside the burger, and made for the perfect mouthwateringly sweet pairing with the salty and creamy bleu cheese. The overall effect was exactly what you want from a gourmet burger: an overwhelming combination of interesting flavors that you feel the need to analyze as you chew. Despite the hype of the KBBQ burger, this classic combination of bleu cheese-in-burger stole the show.
Accompanying meals are some lackluster too-soft sweet potato waffle fries with an excellent peach ketchup, and house fries which were surprisingly tasty in their crispy simplicity.
Some appetizers worth trying include the baked crab dip with dynamite sauce, masago, charred tomato, nori and toast, also a fan favorite in online reviews. Portion sizes are moderate, and diners are able to finish their meals and still entertain thoughts of dessert, which they will be thankful they did.
The cruller donuts were dusted with cinnamon sugar and served with a rich whipped cream, unpretentious and singularly delicious. Though the cinnamon-sugar and cream combination has been repeated thousands of times before, Plan Check did it as well — or better — than every other. The donut was dense enough to cut into with a spoon, but not too heavy and easily a new favorite to any dessert-lover.
The crowd seemed to be taking full advantage of the wide range of beers Plan Deck had on tap, as well as the huge selection of cocktails and spirits.
Overall the experience was a pleasant, positive one, and though Plan Check didn’t blow up diners’ tastebuds in singularly unexpected ways, its variety entices them to go again, order different things and recommend it to others.

It’s no joke that funny people often harbor an inherent desire to be taken seriously.
Crazy like a fox · Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited to the estate of deranged millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) to train for the 1988 games in Bennett Miller’s Foxcatcher. – Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
For actors, this desire can lead to a hunger for darker, more dramatic roles. Jim Carrey spent years stretching his rubber-faced comedy routine to the limit before surprising audiences with a string of soulfully subdued performances in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The late, great Robin Williams was a seriocomic omnivore, reigning in his manic, freewheeling energy to play profoundly broken men in The Fisher King and One Hour Photo. After a lengthy absence from the screen (contributions to Wes Anderson’s oeuvre notwithstanding), Bill Murray returned as a sad-eyed pathos generator in Lost in Translation. Even Adam Sandler felt compelled to add depth to his standard man-child histrionics in Punch-Drunk Love. Now, with the release of director Bennett Miller’s absorbing psychodrama Foxcatcher, Steve Carell seems destined to join their ranks.
The comic actor, best known for playing the trident-throwing, lamp-loving simpleton Brick Tamland in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and the well-meaning but clueless Michael Scott on The Office, is nearly unrecognizable as eccentric millionaire John du Pont, the real-life heir to a vast chemical company fortune whose obvious mental illness — he’s eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia — has been enabled and amplified by a life of unchecked power and privilege.
Simply put: What Mr. du Pont wants, Mr. du Pont gets, and as Miller’s film opens, there’s nothing the self-proclaimed “ornithologist, philatelist and philanthropist” wants more than to turn his family’s sprawling Foxcatcher Farm into a world-class training facility for U.S. Olympic wrestlers, a place where he can serve as coach, mentor and daily inspiration to the men tasked with restoring greatness to America.
To accomplish this, du Pont sets out to recruit brothers Mark (Channing Tatum) and David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), both Olympic gold medalists, to serve as the team’s leaders. Mark, eager to escape the shadow of the sibling who practically raised him, volunteers to relocate to du Pont’s estate to train for the upcoming 1988 games in Seoul. Once there, he finds himself inexorably drawn to the strange, soft-spoken aristocrat and gradually descends into a life of cocaine-fueled excess and low-key homoeroticism. David, hoping to break du Pont’s psychological hold on his brother after months of estrangement, moves out to Foxcatcher Farm with his wife and childen to oversee the team’s progress, a decision that ultimately proves tragic.
Miller, a filmmaker who previously demonstrated a great aptitude for dramatizing historical events in Moneyball and Capote, does a commendable job of examining these three men and the series of events that led them to become so fatefully entangled, to the point where the triptych begins to take on the elements of Greek tragedy. The script, co-written by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, lays out compelling reasons for each character’s individual neurosis or neuroses — du Pont’s withholding equestrian mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who views wrestling as a “low sport,” Mark and David’s dangerous co-dependence stemming from a childhood lived on the road — all without giving away the purposely abrupt ending, which comes as a sudden, sickening shock, even for those who remember the true story, which reached its harrowing conclusion in the winter of 1996.
Hidden beneath layers of makeup and a hooked prosthetic nose that gives his face the appearance of a well-fed bird of prey, Carell, once thought to be an actor whose range was decidedly limited to loveable underdogs and harmless goofballs, gives an understated yet transformative performance that dazzles and disturbs in equal measure. He’s been building to this role for a while now, from the suicidal gay uncle in Little Miss Sunshine to the emotionally abusive stepfather in last year’s The Way Way Back, but this is a true breakthrough. Everything about his du Pont, from his thousand-yard stare to his precise but emotionless manner of speaking, is designed to unsettle without resorting to the realm of weirdo caricature. An Oscar nomination is a virtual certainty at this point.
Tatum, meanwhile, shows off his own greatly improved dramatic chops as Mark, whose strong-but-silent exterior masks a seething cauldron of impotent rage towards the sibling he both resents and reveres, while Ruffalo believably embodies David, a genuinely nice guy who wants to do right by Mark without uprooting his family in the process. An early scene of the two brothers wrestling together, their bodies contorted in a delicate dance of submission, establishes their relationship better than words ever could.
To be clear: Foxcatcher is more than just a superior acting showcase. It’s also a fairly damning critique of American exceptionalism and a deeply unnerving look at old money’s inbred view of the world. John du Pont was a man who thought he could buy and break human athletes the way his mother kept and groomed horses, and when reality failed to live up to his warped perception, cold-blooded murder became the only option.

The Farrelly brothers have said it themselves: Their comedy isn’t for everyone. That being said, Dumb and Dumber To shouldn’t be entirely disregarded by those of us who prefer the dialogue-based humor of modern comedy to the farce and slapstick that dominated the cinema of the 1990s.
They still got it · Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have not missed a beat from their absurd antics of the original Dumb and Dumber from 1994. – Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures
 
Dumb and Dumber To follows idiotic childhood friends Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) on their road trip to track down Harry’s daughter, who was born and given up for adoption more than 20 years ago, all without his knowledge. Needless to say, their plans go awry, and murderous wives, Special Forces agents and all manner of chaos follow in their wake. Watching the trailer, as well as any knowledge of the original movie, should give audiences a pretty accurate idea of what they’re getting into. Among the wincing, cringing and utter ridiculousness, this movie is not without a fairly steady run of good jokes and clever comedic writing.
For those who don’t recall, or chose never to indulge in, the cult classic original movie Dumb and Dumber, it followed a much younger Christmas and Dunne on their original road trip. Equally full of absurd mishaps and crude jokes as the sequel is, it also featured possibly the most famous toilet-oriented scene in movie history. The sequel shouldn’t disappoint any avid fans of the original but is, for the most part, equally accessible to the novice. While I confess there were a few moments during the film when laughter erupted throughout the audience to my utter confusion, I was able to follow the plot easily and pick up on most of the gags.
Dumb and Dumber To begins with a slightly older-looking pair of leading men, who, despite nearly two decades of time having past, have not lost any of their stupidity or adolescent humor. After an undeniably entertaining, if not desperately distasteful and uncomfortable opening sequence, the aged Harry reveals to Lloyd that he is in need of a kidney transplant. Fortuitously, at this juncture Harry finds he unknowingly fathered a child to Fraida Felcher (played to perfection by a deadpan and decidedly frumpy looking Kathleen Turner). Harry suddenly discovers he has a full-grown daughter, with, as Lloyd puts it “full grown kidneys.” Thus sparks the road trip that is the thrust of the story, in which Christmas and Dunne travel to the renowned “KEN Conference” in El Paso in search of both daughter and kidneys. Travelling by hearse, Zamboni and Dunne’s “Mutt Cutts” truck of the first movie, Lloyd and Harry do not find themselves alone. Penny (Harry’s daughter) has a somewhat less than favorable adopted mother, Adele Pinchlow (Laurie Holden), who is attempting to poison her kind-hearted, scientific genius of a husband and take hold of his ample inheritance. So, no stereotypes there. Still, this isn’t a movie that’s trying to explore character too deeply. As Harry and Lloyd carry a billion-dollar scientific invention to Penny, Adele plots a way to hinder their progress and take the invention and money for herself, with the help of various weak-willed but well-armed male accomplices.
The Farrelly brothers really are the lifeblood of this movie, as well as its predecessor. Peter and Bobby wrote the script and directed the film, and while the finished product is far from serious, it is evident that a great deal of attention and pride went into the making of this movie. Their humor and characteristic touch is evident in all their work, from the 1998 blockbuster There’s Something About Mary to Shallow Hal, which brought Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow together as potentially the most unlikely on-screen couple of the last two decades. However, Dumb and Dumber being the brother’s first breakout movie gave it a definite fond place in their hearts, and both have stated their continued desire to make sequels to the original for many years.
After the Farrellys, Carrey and Daniels anchor the movie in utter absurdity. While Carrey has made his name as an impressive and respected dramatic actor in films such as The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I Love You Phillip Morris, he has never relinquished his love for slapstick comedy, as was evident in his eagerness to participate in this sequel. Similarly, Jeff Daniels started work on Dumb and Dumber To immediately after winning an Emmy for his performance in The Newsroom, demonstrating both actors’ versatility.
It is hard to speak entirely seriously about Dumb and Dumber To because “serious” simply isn’t a word in the vocabulary of this movie. The performance is so utterly exaggerated, with Carrey’s dopey and slightly horrifying “silly face” making multiple appearances in every scene, and the farce so completely lewd, that one just has to settle into it. Once the viewers accept this movie for what it is, they’ll find themselves laughing, even if it is in spite of themselves.

In our Sept. 28 Letter to the Editor (“The University needs to revive student activism”), we lamented the lack of student activism on campus and called for more cooperation among student organizations and greater involvement by all students in general. Our article, rather unsurprisingly, was met with various challenges, most of which we believe are unwarranted. With the hopes of clarifying our main points and to continue a healthy conversation, we would like to list some of the criticisms of our article and respond to them.
Public schools tend to be more vocal. The claim that private universities are generally less politically active because their student body tends to be more conservative might be true, but it cannot fully explain the experience of USC. As such, we politely disagree that students in public universities are more vocal compared to their private counterparts. If this were true, how could we explain Columbia University in the 1960s, where protests erupted in response to the alleged connection of the university with the American government during the Vietnam War? Or how could we explain the dozens of elite private universities that had chapters of Students for a Democratic Society? Similarly, how can we explain public schools that are apolitical? We chose to discuss UC Berkeley not because it is a public institution, but because it is familiar to us and because we wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement, a gesture we thought important as the anniversary went mostly ignored by the media.
Our “true intentions” are for students to be more vocal in favor of “liberal causes.” We will politely disagree with this statement in full. The examples we use in our article included rape, sexual assault and discrimination (perhaps even racism) but we were accused of calling for a “specific activism.”  But it is not clear to us what is precisely “liberal” or “left-wing” about these issues, as the comments imply. We are not asking students to share our opinions. We explicitly state that we want more activism from both the Right and the Left and all their variants. Our overall argument is that no real voices are heard and our main concern is isolated activism. As stated in our article, the Free Speech Movement would have not been successful if it weren’t for the unified participation of political organizations ranging from the Young Socialists to the Young Republicans.
Why rape, sexual assault, racism and discrimination? Comments on our article questioned why we would like to see more activism dealing with these issues as opposed to other issues. We were questioned as to why we don’t call for action in the following cases: when Governor Brown allowed undocumented migrants to acquire drivers  licenses, Obama’s delayed response to the threat of ISIS, and the control of unions on local and state budgets, among other issues. While these are all important (and we truly believe they are), we chose rape, sexual assault, racism and discrimination because they affect many USC students in a direct way. Have any of your students been raped and forced to continue attending school with their perpetrator? Ours have. The examples mentioned in the comments, we believe, are less connected to the daily functioning of the campus and students. That doesn’t mean that they are less important, but we are talking about the issues that are at our doorsteps. Call us biased, but we care more about students getting raped than undocumented migrants being able to drive to work. Again, they are not irrelevant issues, just less pertinent to our article.
In closing, we would like to point out that apathy is not conservative, as suggested by comments. Both Left and Right organizations on campus are sparsely supported. Additionally, our argument was not meant to be partisan as also suggested by some comments. In our opinion, commentators disagreeing with our position seem to put ideology above our common community on campus. And this is what we are striving for: a common community where all ideologies agree on cases of clear violations of human rights.
Universities are, at heart, institutions built to help students understand the world, question conventional wisdom, and foster a community of learning and development. If students of any and all political persuasions are not questioning, campaigning and conversing on all kinds of social issues, then the university has failed its mission. If students are aware of horrible tragedies that violate human rights, but are not moved to do something about it, then this is both a moral failing of the student, and a failure of the university to foster a sufficiently close Trojan Family (a recent survey by the USG found that 29 percent of Black students have a low sense of belonging on campus). One cannot expand one’s intellectual understanding without developing one’s emotional understanding. Too often, we believe, USC students are receiving information but not an education. We can see it in the lack of action, or what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. called “the fierce urgency of now,” when our community most needs people not to walk by on the other side.

Vigilant readers will notice that this is almost assuredly a direct response to my comments on the original post.  I stand by those comments, and the mere fact that they triggered such specific response serves only to confirm that I’ve elevated the debate and caused the writers to explain themselves.
Unfortunately this response simply restates the views expressed in the original piece, and offers nothing new.  I’m unmoved.  I clearly disagree with the writers in terms of issues that matter, or should matter, to students at USC.  No one, including me, suggested that issues like rape, sexual assault, discrimination or racism are not important issues.  Of course they are.  However I believe that students at USC should also be very interested in and aware of the issues that I raised, and for the writers to suggest that they are “not as important” to students at USC is incredibly ignorant, narrow-minded and short-sighted to me.  First of all, many students at USC are in fact from out of state, if not from out of the country, and will likely be in college for 4 to 6 years of their lives.  The issues I raised will not only impact them directly now, as Californians and Americans, but for years to come.  Even USC’s international students would be well-served to educate themselves on these larger issues that affect them as adults and human beings… not just students at USC.
I will apologize for one thing, and that is that I MAY have been incorrect in my belief that the writers are really only interested in more activism if said activism mirrors their own beliefs or political points of view.  It is possible that the writers would like to see more activism even if it presents opposing views.  However, my position remains a likely possibility given their response published here, and the somewhat antagonistic approach to my fair and reasoned comments.
Difference of opinion is inevitable, if not important.  Again, my positions are reasoned and objective.  They are not offered in the abstract, but are a reflection of my experiences.  It’s amazing how, as a college student, you reflect back on your high school years almost with embarrassment at the things that seemed important at the time.  Then, when you’re my age, you look back at your college years, realizing the same thing, and remembering the many empty voices making so much sound.  It’s sort of sad.
You mean to say “rooted in tradition”.
USC is traditionally a conservative school. If you want a progressive liberal oriented education, you should’ve gone to UCLA.  Most USC students are politically and culturally aware, but are not interested in running their mouth about issues they don’t care about. What issues should USC students be protesting about these days?
1. LGBT activism?
2. Femininazi activism?
3. The POTUS lies of the past 6 years, and those since he was in college at Occidental?
4. The Federal Reserve destroying the purchasing value of the dollar?
5. Nancy Pelosi and president Obama lying to the American public about The Affordable Care Act and how they couldn;t pass it if American knew what was in it?
6. The lies about the involvement of Jonathan Gruber in the Obama Administration?
7. The fact that Barack Hussein Obama is a pathological liar and a sociopath?
Pick any topic…..
Yes, this is an exact microcosm of the problem I am talking about, the mentality that the best course of action is always to repeat the path of your predecessors. If you disagree, then you made a mistake.
The younger crowd finds it much more difficult to maintain such a position when we have access to the wealth of information that is out there.
Whose opinion do you listen to, that of your students? Or someone who is a recognizable parrot of republican talking points?
No offense.
there is an identity crisis, between being a modern west coast school pushing the boundaries and trying to be an east coast school rooted in traditionality and maintaining the status quo

Net neutrality is under attack in the United States. If you don’t know what net neutrality is, or why you should care, answer the following question: Why are you reading this?
You might think, “Because I clicked on the link,” or “Because the headline looked interesting.”
Linda Xu | Daily Trojan
All the above are reasons you want to read this column. But in today’s world of information overload, you all have busy lives and short attention spans. As much as it pains me to say this, if you’re reading online, the time it takes your Internet browser to load this column plays the biggest role in determining whether or not you will actually read it.
This is true of everything from my weekly rants to shows like Game of Thrones on HBO to YouTube videos of parents telling their kids they ate all of their Halloween candy. These days, Google engineers have discovered that a difference of 250 milliseconds in loading time gives one website a competitive advantage over another. Statistically speaking, if the good folks at the Daily Bruin had a website that loaded a blink of an eye faster than the Daily Trojan, they would have a significant competitive advantage.
“Net neutrality” is the concept that all data deserves to be treated equally — in other words, that Internet service providers like Comcast and Time Warner that act as middle men between you and your Game of Thrones episode can’t allow websites like the Daily Bruin (or more realistically, Netflix) to pay extra to increase their loading speed — and thus, their advantage over competitors with less money.
As of 2010, the Federal Communications Commission adopted an “Open Internet Order,” which included, in part, a ban on unfair content discrimination and a refusal to approve “pay for priority” agreements. There are three problems with current policy: the rule does not explicitly prohibit ISPs from charging more money for faster access. Second, earlier this year, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the FCC could not enforce network neutrality rules on specific companies (in that case, Verizon) that enforced network neutrality rules. Third, the FCC is considering new rules this year that go against protecting net neutrality, and allow ISPs to charge content providers more money if they want their videos to load faster.
Net neutrality should be supported, plain and simple. For one, without it, corporations have broad discretion over who sees what public information. If you think China censors its Internet, imagine if a Time Warner or Comcast CEO decided to charge certain news outlets with political leanings more to increase their download speeds. Putting freedom to access information in the hands of corporations makes about as much sense as Little Red Riding Hood hiring the Big Bad Wolf to watch Grandma.
The moral of the story is that net neutrality is a question of values as much at it is a question of policy. A shift away from net neutrality represent not only the beginning of the decline of American democracy, but also the beginning of the end of the free market. Abandoning net neutrality would allow near perfect price discrimination in the Internet market. Monopolies like Comcast and Time Warner, because they have an enormous share of the market, could charge outlandish prices without fear of competition. Moreover, they could create tiers of Internet speed service. When Netflix has to pay more to secure a higher download speed than HBO, guess who will also pay more? You.
Oh, and did I mention Comcast is trying to acquire Time Warner in order to become an even bigger company? Federal regulators would stop such a move, but Comcast spent more money lobbying the government last year (to the tune of 18.8 million) than every single corporation except one. Why? To convince the government to approve the buyout of Time Warner: a situation that, regardless of the debate over net neutrality, should be opposed at all costs.
From President Barack Obama to HBO comedian John Oliver, opposition to chipping away at network neutrality is strong. The problem is that though Obama issued a statement in support of net neutrality and received much backlash, he is also responsible for appointing the current FCC commissioner Tom Wheeler, a venture capitalist who previously worked as a lobbyist for the telecommunications industry, and the man partly responsible for the new FCC rules. Though Oliver delivered a brilliant segment in opposition to the new rules as well, Oliver knows that whatever happens, HBO, which carries his show, will always be able to afford to buy an Internet fast lane.
In short, these people make good arguments — but they don’t have a dog in the fight.
What about a college newspaper like the Daily Trojan? We would never be able to afford to make our content download as fast as any other media network in such a world.
In short, we would lose our voice. Dissenting articles like this one might never see the light of day. In Game of Thrones, the Lannister family has enough power to control the country and silence dissenters. If net neutrality is abandoned, Americans won’t just be paying more to watch that story — they’ll be living in it.

The Interfraternity Council cancelled their scheduled tailgates in Exposition Park Thursday prior to the football game against University of California, Berkeley.
Tailgating for the Thursday night game is prohibited on campus and The Row.
“There was a miscommunication between the university and IFC as to what the tailgating situation would be like,” IFC President Tanner Sandoval said. “We made an agreement after last semester to work with [the university] to find a space that works for us. We were dealing with where we were going to put 4,000 people before the game.”
The university could not be reached for comment.
According to Sandoval, the area in Exposition Park that was initially reserved for the fraternities’ tailgate did not allow alcohol to be served. Sandoval said IFC found a new space two weeks ago in the park but needed to hire security in order for alcohol to be served. The security company that is contracted by the city of Los Angeles to work in the park, however, was already fully booked for the tailgate sponsored by the University Student Government and another event.
Sandoval said the event still could have been held but alcohol would not have been able to be served.
“With the cost of the space, it wouldn’t have been worth it,” Sandoval said.
Sandoval said individual fraternities will now be responsible for finding their own tailgate locations, though he cannot guarantee that they will comply with restrictions to tailgating on The Row.
“Whether or not they all comply, especially considering the circumstance with Expo Park, I can’t say,” he said.

Just over two months after admitting that the story that made him famous was a lie, senior cornerback Josh Shaw has finally gone on record to explain what happened the night he sprained both ankles.
On Aug. 25, USC released a story explaining that the co-captain of the football team had sustained two ankle sprains after jumping off a balcony at his sister’s home in Palmdale, California, in an attempt to save his nephew, Carter, from drowning in the pool below.
On Thursday, Shaw admitted to Bill Plaschke of the LA Times that he did not sprain his ankles saving his nephew, but rather after getting in a loud argument with his long-time girlfriend at his apartment, which prompted neighbors to call the police.
Though both Shaw and his girlfriend, Angela Chilton, insist that the argument never escalated to physical violence, he still decided to flee from the police out of fear after his girlfriend left her apartment, while he remained inside.
“We were not on good terms when she left, I thought she had somebody call authorities. I was thinking the worst,” Shaw told Plaschke. “If she did say anything, I’m a black man with dreadlocks, and with everything going on in the country at the time, all that stuff in St. Louis [Ferguson, Mo.] … in my mind, I’m going to leap from the balcony so authorities did not see me.”
Shaw said when he jumped and landed on a grassy patch on Figueroa Street, he immediately felt pain shoot up both his legs, and feared he had broken them. Thinking he had surely ruined his season before it began, Shaw felt he needed a good excuse to tell his coaches.
“I wanted to come up with something that they would say, ‘Josh, if you got hurt, that’s a good reason to get hurt,’” he told Plaschke. “That’s where fabrication came in.”
After USC’s sports information department sat down with Shaw to vet the story, they released it to the public, and it immediately picked up national attention. Shaw was lauded for his heroism on every major news outlet, including ESPN and Fox Sports 1, who named Shaw their “Best Person in Sports” the day the story broke.
When rumors started to swirl about the story not being true, many people critiqued USC for breaking the story on its own and started to question the validity of schools’ sports information departments. But USC’s head sports information director, Tim Tessalone, insisted that the school needed to explain Shaw’s absence and took the necessary steps to vet the story.
“We have our starting cornerback being carted around campus in a wheelchair, people would be seeing it,” Tessalone told Plaschke. “We knew it was a feel-good story, but we also knew it was a news story.”
Shaw knew he had to come clean when he saw his lie broadcast on national television, but was afraid of the consequences. After gathering his family to explain what he had done, Shaw finally met with USC officials on Wednesday, Aug. 27 to explain that he had fabricated his heroic actions. The school announced that he lied and would be suspended indefinitely, but never disclosed the true cause of his injuries.
Shaw, who racked up 67 tackles and four interceptions last year, will be suspended until he is formally absolved of wrongdoing by prosecutors and by USC’s own investigators. The Trojans only have three games left this season, and it remains to be seen whether Shaw will ever come back and play another game in cardinal and gold.

Undergraduate Student Government partnered with Residential Student Government on an open forum Wednesday night that allowed students to voice their concerns about student life. The event was meant to give USG and RSG a better understanding of what students want out of their daily lives on campus so they can then advocate for those changes to be made.
Voicing concerns · Sera Choi, president of Residential Student Government, listens to students at Wednesday night’s open forum. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
There were four panelists at the forum: RSG President Sera Choi, RSG Vice President of Advocacy David Branson, USG Director of University Affairs Jordan Fowler and USG Vice President Rini Sampath. Alana Victor, USG Co-Director of External Relations, planned the event.
According to Sampath, this was the first direct partnership between USG and RSG, but both committees look forward to collaborating more in the future. Sampath reached out to Choi to set up the collaboration. Sampath said that she and Choi met last year when they were part of a task force to address alcohol and social policies at USC. When talking, they realized that it would be a good idea to pool their resources and create a bigger event that would allow for undergraduate students to voice their opinions about campus life.
“We’re really excited to have this forum with you all because I think it’s a great way to see where students stand on what they’re passionate about and what students want to see on campus,”  Choi said. “Hopefully, we can come up with solutions together and find out and be inspired for future projects during the rest of the year.”
The panelists talked about the current projects USG and RSG are working on. One of the first mentioned by USG was improving the printers in residence halls. Students have mentioned that they would prefer heavy-duty black and white printers as opposed to individual use color printers. USG is working on a proposal to get printers that are more reliable.
Fowler talked about possibly extending dining hall hours so that they open earlier and close later. Students have also complained about the dining halls being closed during Spring Break. USG is trying to pass a proposal that would keep at least one dining hall open during breaks when some students remain on campus.
Sampath addressed the complaints brought up by spring admits. Due to the lack of space in residence halls that are hubs of social activity, spring admits often have to live in off-campus housing and university-owned apartments, such as Cardinal Gardens. USG plans to start working on creating a stronger community in the fall between spring admits.
“There is a housing freeze right now, so we can bring spring admits into certain areas. We’re keeping spaces open in first-year communities so they can be integrated into those communities. In the east area, they have isolated pockets so people can be together. That way they are not just randomly set aside with the senior that’s about to graduate,” said David Hong, advisor of RSG and an assistant director for Parkside Residential Colleges.
USG panelists mentioned the possible implementation of a bike-sharing program on campus, but due to the small acreage of the University Park, Transportation is questioning whether it would be necessary or even in demand.
Another topic of discussion was expanding the LAX shuttle schedule. Students are asking for more shuttles to run to and from the airport during breaks. One limitation to this potential project, however, is a lack of storage space for the shuttles.
RSG talked about how they are working with Hospitality. There is a recipe committee that goes over the dishes that are served in all the dining halls. The committee attempts to figure out which dishes are working and which aren’t, but RSG is trying to figure out a way to extend that to the students and get more direct input.
RSG and USG talked about improving sustainability. The panelists mentioned that the student government bodies are planning on working with the Environmental Student Assembly to spread awareness about the conservation of water, paper and electricity. Also, RSG has asked housing to add recycling bins to each residence hall.
“I think both of our student governments do awesome things, but it’s frustrating to find out that nobody knows about it. We want the students to take advantage of these programs. We’re trying to figure out, how can we effectively communicate to the students of USC? I think that working on promoting these events and programs is a great way USG and RSG can collaborate,” said Michael Tong, national residence hall honorary president.

In the past few days, an online petition for the Engemann Student Health Center to employ a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner has gained traction among students.
The SANE qualification is a forensic specialization for personnel trained to conduct sexual assault exams for rape victims. According to the petition, the nearest location that has these specialists is at the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica — a fact that is concerning USC students. Proponents of the petition say that traveling more than 30 minutes to an unfamiliar location can be a burden on victims.
Holly Blair, a freshman majoring in English, started the petition on Nov. 5 after a Title IX coordinator spoke at her sorority, Delta Gamma, and was unable to respond when asked why there isn’t a SANE team at USC. Blair also said she was spurred by a personal connection, which motivated her to include an anecdote in her petition.
“One of my friends believes she was roofied at a party, so she wanted to check if she was sexually assaulted but was told that she could not do so on campus. With all the work to promote awareness about sexual assault, it’s really strange that we have no resources on campus to administer a rape kit,” Blair wrote in the petition.
Blair is aiming to get at least 1,000 signatures on her petition, which currently has almost 700.
Many students have been surprised to learn that USC doesn’t already have SANE. Hannah Maluyao, a sophomore majoring in public relations, expressed disappointment that USC didn’t already have such a center.
“USC is a world-class institution, so it’s kind of ridiculous to me that we haven’t employed a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner,” Maluyao said.
The Engemann Student Health Center declined to comment.
Francesca Bessey, the associate director of Wellness Affairs for Undergraduate Student Government, said that it was common for schools not to have a SANE center and that colleges usually outsource to resources in the area.
Bessey also pointed out that though the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center is housed in the UCLA Medical Center, it is actually an independent body operated by the Rape Foundation.
“They are considered the leader, not only in the area, but in nation in providing care for victims of sexual assault,” Bessey said. “So it’s actually a very good place to send students, and one of the great things they do is that they offer free transportation.”
Similarly, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that USC currently provides a sufficient response for victims of sexual assault. He emphasized that there is a fundamental difference between treatment and examination of forensic evidence.
“Treatment is what we have right now at Engemann,” Carry said. “If a student was a victim of sexual assault, we can offer counseling services. If a student suffers physical injuries, we can treat that. If a student needs the morning-after pill, we have that. If a student is infected with a S.T.D., we can treat that. We have a treatment protocol available for students who are victims of unwanted sexual contact.”
As for examining forensic evidence, Carry explained that the process to determine if a sexual assault occurred is a rather extensive scientific process.
“A rape kit means the collection of semen, DNA, body wounds or blood tissue samples,” he said. “The forensic collection of sexual assault is a science. And certain protocols have to be performed for this material to be accepted as evidence in a criminal investigation. We do not have a team that does forensic work so that is where we connect to the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center.”
Carry also said that this is a time-sensitive process. It becomes more difficult to obtain forensic evidence the longer a victim waits and becomes especially more difficult if the victim takes a shower or discards the clothing he or she was wearing.
Carry said he doesn’t think it’s practical to duplicate such a system at USC when the Santa Monica Center is already one of the most renowned facilities in the country.
Carry did, however, mention the possibility of the Keck School of Medicine of USC developing such a forensic team in the future as an extension of the Violence Intervention Program at Keck. This program, headed by Dr. Astrid Heger, mostly deals with forensic exams in the cases of child abuse but is, according to Carry, looking to expand its scope to college students in cases of sexual assault.
For the moment, Carry suggested students take advantage of the fact that the Santa Monica center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He said that the Dept. of Public Safety or  the Los Angeles Police Department should work with the assault victim to bring him or her to the center immediately after the incident.
Bessey thinks the petition reflects a misunderstanding of the breakdown of communication between first responders and sexual assault victims as the root of the problem.
“It really emphasizes the importance of explaining to students the options that they have in detail and making sure that the first responders are educated and are able to make the students feel comfortable,” she said. “Because if not, then you have a problem right from the get-go regardless of what kind of resources that the university may or may not offer.”
How can parents sign the petition? Mobilize quickly. It’s Parent Weekend and this is an important potential crime deterrent.

The Division of Student Affairs opened the Veteran Resource Center in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center last week.
The VRC provides USC’s growing veteran student population, currently numbered at 896, with resources such as certification and student transitioning resources that were previously spread out across campus, making the transition from the military to university life easier for incoming students. The center is open to both undergraduate and graduate students who served or are actively serving in any military branch.

The VRC offers certification assistance to veteran students, which helps when determining if a student is eligible for educational assistance, a program that is administered by the Veterans Administration. The center will guide students through the certification application process and deal with the paperwork of sending enrollment certifications to regional Veterans Administration offices.
Matthew Nordstrom, a junior majoring in political science who is also an active Marines Reservist, has high hopes for the VRC.
“It’s great to be able to have this space available to us,” Nordstorm said. “Having one central location to meet together is a big help. Now I will be able to easily identify other veterans on campus by coming to VRC.”
The VRC is being housed in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center due to its central location on campus and the availability of the space. The center includes three offices for staff, a flat-screen television, lounge area, meeting space and computer stations.
“Our veteran students have been asking for a Veterans Resource Center for some time, and we were really fortunate to be able to give the square footage to the VRC. We have a lot of wonderful partners across campus who are part of the military support committee who have helped us build the vision into a reality,” said Monique Allard, assistant provost for Student Affairs & Student Engagement.
Carlos Forcadilla, communications chair for the USC Veterans Association and a graduate student studying social work who served in the Army, said veteran students would find the center beneficial.
“There wasn’t one designated spot before the VRC, now it will make it much easier for us to have our Veterans Association meetings,” he said. “The center will also help the younger guys feel more comfortable and allow us to show them the ropes of what it’s like to transition from being in the military to being a student. It’s really a one-stop shop for everything we need.”
Apart from the VRC, the Office of Alumni Relations recently launched an affiliated group called USC Veterans Alumni Network.
“The purpose of the Veterans Alumni Network is to have a university-recognized organization for veterans that want to support USC,” said Patrick E. Auerbach, associate senior vice president for alumni relations. “It’s really a perfect match for the university because we have dedicated Trojans who are also veterans, and now have an avenue by which to become more involved in a wide array of areas. We expect them to be a fully chartered organization by the end of the academic year.”

On Wednesday, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation held a rally with the UNITE HERE Local 11 union to protest the low wages USC workers currently earn. UNITE HERE Local 11 is a labor union representing 20,000 workers in Southern California including many employees in USC Hospitality, USC Housing and USC Auxiliary Services.
Campus workers unite · USC workers and students from the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation rally in front of the United University Church on Wednesday night to protest low wages. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
 
The average worker at USC earns a yearly wage of $18,800, an amount becoming increasingly more difficult to live on as rent prices around the USC community continue to rise. USC workers making a yearly income of $18,800 are considered to be living below the poverty line.
Lorelei Christie, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics, and law and a member of SCALE, explained the goal of the rally.
“The workers are fighting for a new contract right now and are asking for better wages, guaranteed hours and a reasonable workload. SCALE is supporting them in this fight for a fair contract,” she said.
Christie also listed the difficulties workers face at USC: struggling to pay bills, living in gang-ridden areas, working an unreasonable and irregular workload and facing the threat of homelessness.
Union members, USC workers and USC students alike gathered at the United University Church to start the rally. The rally began with blessings from Rev. Tom Carey, a Franciscan monk at the Church of the Epiphany who encouraged using the same school spirit in academics and athletics to be used to support workers’ rights.
Carey ended his speech with, “Fight on for human dignity!” Several USC workers, including a Trojan Grounds barista, a cook at Parkside International Residential College dining hall and a steward at Café 84, spoke to the crowd about their experiences working at USC and how the low wages are impairing their quality of life. A professor at the Price School of Public Policy also spoke at the event, joking that she could only voice her support because she is an associate adjunct faculty member and is not tenured.
After the speeches concluded, the protestors exited campus at the Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street intersection and marched around the outskirts of USC. According to members in SCALE, they would have liked to march throughout campus; however, DPS denied them permission and forced the organizers to lead the march around campus instead. The protestors marched past the intersection of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, shouting, “They say go away! We say no way!” and “This is what democracy looks like!”
The Widney Society Gala, which honors million-dollar donors to USC, was hosted at Price School of Public Policy the same time. The march down Exposition Boulevard consequently blocked the entrance to valet parking for a time.
The rally organizers emphasized how many of the workers live near the university and ought to be treated as part of the USC community. One of the USC workers, an employee at Café 84, lives a few miles south of campus and bikes to work, where he parks his bike inside a building since he already had a bike stolen once.
The worker said that his current monthly income is the same as his rent, forcing him to choose between household necessities.
“It’s either buy my daughter some shoes or pay my bills,” he said.
He explained that he was unable to pay the bills for certain months when his wife was unemployed, forcing him to take out loans that he is still struggling to pay off.
The worker hopes to achieve an income level enough for his family to move to a better neighborhood. Moving, however, is becoming more difficult as the rent escalates. He said that rent prices have increased and attributed the increase to the new USC Village currently under construction.
“This construction is boosting the rent everywhere,” he said.
Today is a sad day for me, because some friends of mine from the USC community are loosing their rights and decency. I started my day by going to Parkside restaurant and grabbed a copy of the Daily Trojan. All the football and family weekend related blissful news made ‘SCALE holds worker rally with local union’ seem out of the cord with the times. The article talks about “students and workers marched around campus in protest of low wages”. Some protesting workers work at three dinning halls on campus. As a person with unlimited meal plan, I know how hard they work and I witness how long and mechanical their jobs are. For example, a cashier at each dining hall is responsible for swiping in thousands of students for eight hours straight with many restrictions. Restrictions include but not limit to, can’t wear warm coat, which would cover their USC hospitality shirt; can’t check their phone or listen to music. Cashiers are basically asked to do one thing-swiping student ID- over and over. However, the boring nature of this kind of job didn’t  stop them from extending their genuine welcome to student patrons. One of the first English conversation that I learned at first grade was “how are you?” It wasn’t hard for a six year old back then. However, saying “how are you” with earnest hearts for eight hours at a cold day with low wags is extremely hard. Therefore, workers at dinning halls and greater USC community deserve respect. Next time, when you see a janitor or a facility worker, make sure to say thanks and pay respect that they deserve. 
	On the same day, I was informed that Staff Pro extended their employee 8 hour shift to 12 hour shift. Staff Pro is a company that manages USC on-campus housing finger print station security. Now, Staff Pro employees at USC has to work from 8pm to 8am without overtime pay, because the 12 hour working span is broken into two separate shifts, on four hour shift on the first night from 8pm to midnight day and the other eight hour shift in the next day morning from midnight to 8am. Despite the fact that they are working for 12 hours successively. In addition, working 12 hours straight became the only option that employees have now, instead of the 4 or 8 hours options that they previously had. Although those employees are not directly managed by USC, but they are an integral part of the USC community. No one else provides safety to students like the way Staff Pro employees and DPS do. Working 12 hours is not only cruel for all employees, but also threatening to the quality of their work, which demands to them be high alert at all time. Workers and employees have limited bargaining power in comparison with administrations and corporations. This doesn’t mean that they should not have a say on what they prefer and what they deserve. 
	I love USC dearly. I am thankful to go here. I am proud of our Heisman trophy winners and Nobel laureates, but I also take pride in Francis, the omelet maker; David, the finger print guy; Connie, the meal plan swiper.  Without Heisman trophy winners and Nobel laureates, USC might drop its US News raking. Without janitors, chiefs, and security staff, USC can not function at all. At the rally against the low wages, “Rev Tom Carey, a Franciscan monk at the church of the Epiphany  encouraged using the same school spirit in academics and athletics to be used to support workers’ rights”. 
	USA, the most powerful nation on earth, champions a market driven economy. Many theorists argue that a rise of the minimal wage will result in further unemployment. However, USC community should not just be a cold heart organization that makes decision only based on the number. In addition, Costco has proved that corporation can succeed when paying their employee fair wages, “because it helps build a strong workforce and profitability over the long run through increased productivity, better morale and lower turnover rates.” I have no intent to get into any kind of political or idealogical argument in regards of different economic policy. I simply wish that USC and Staff Pro employee can have a less restricted life, where their children, one day like us, can afford to pursue better opportunities with adequate financial stability from their parents work at USC. As a lifelong and worldwide Trojan, lets focus on our local community, lets remain hopeful, and lets work together. 
	FIGHT ON!
Excellent. Labor needs to really be reborn in this era. The income inequality is as bad now as it was leading up to labor’s Hay-days. The fact that business is so incredibly opposed to unions is a testament to how successful they are at moving lower-class people into the middle class – since most larger businesses see that extra money as theirs… it shouldn’t be spent bettering people’s lives! IT’S PROFIT!
