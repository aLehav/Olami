Back in May, West Australian surfer Sasha Jane Lowerson competed in the longboard division of the Western Australian State Titles at her local home in Avalon. She made headlines this year because she was the first openly trans woman to win a surfing competition. 
The surfing media community, with the exception of a few outlets, handled this horribly. You never really want to scroll through the comments of an Instagram post from Stab Mag or the online forum of Beach Grit because there will always be unwarranted vitriol. But it seemed like the outlets went out of their way to open the floodgates of transphobia when Lowerson won.
The main demographic of the comments on a particularly open-ended Stab Mag post was men, of course. Never do they care more about women’s surfing, or women’s anything, until trans identity comes up. The best are the ones from users like @calistahowardd, saying they “support every lgbtq person but this is so messed up :/,” which, I’m not sure how that makes any sense. Some of the worst came from competitive surfers themselves, defaulting to tired and repeated misconceptions about “biological fairness.” 
Before we mention those misconceptions, it’s important to note that the Western Australian State Titles was not the first competition Lowerson ever competed in. She placed 10th in the Noosa Festival of Surfing back in March. Nothing but radio silence when she lost.
The biology arguments have come back into the conversation as the International Surfing Association just released their guidelines for trans athletes last week. The ISA opted for testing testosterone levels and requires that trans women to show the ISA Medical Commission “that her serum testosterone concentration has been less than 5 nmol/L (nanomoles per liter) continuously for a period of the previous 12 months” to compete in the women’s division. The ISA did not say how athletes would be tested, how often they would be tested or specify other possibly critical details.
Testosterone is a sex hormone important to the development of reproductive organs in men, and ovarian function in women. For all genders, the hormone has effects on metabolism, liver function, bones and muscles. “Normal” value ranges in testing happen because different labs use different testing methods. The usual range is 10 to 35 nmol/L in cis men, and 0.5 to 2.4 nmol/L for cis women. Conditions such as inherited adrenal gland disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (affecting 6-12% of people in the United States) and hirsutism can cause naturally higher levels of testosterone in women. 
During the Western Australian State Titles and beyond, Lowerson reported that she was “running at 0.5 [nmol/L].” It is invasive that many people were demanding this sort of information, but it is by no means a novel phenomenon.
In 2019, South African Olympic middle-distance runner Caster Semenya lost a case against the International Association of Athletics Federations when the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that female athletes with naturally high levels of testosterone could not compete in women’s divisions unless they reduced the level of the hormone in their bodies. This effectively demanded athletes like Semenya to go on medications with unknown side effects. 
The decision to discriminate against athletes like Semenya for uncontrollable natural processes contradicts the IAAF’s own analysis on the link between testosterone and performance in women’s track and field. In their study of 1,100 women competing, in three of 11 of the running events, women with lower levels of testosterone performed better than those with higher levels. 
But Semenya wasn’t alone – Namibian track stars Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi, who held four of the five top 400m times in the world in 2021, were banned from the Tokyo Games for naturally high levels of testosterone. They were instructed to take medicine to be able to compete in middle-distance races.
“I wouldn’t want to involve any other things because this is the way my body functions in its normal way,” Masilingi told the BBC. “And if I try something else, I might get caught somewhere else, and something might go wrong with my body.”
To give testosterone the sole credit for athletic prowess is ignoring its natural variances and how it functions in the body. In a 2004 study from the Journal of Sports Sciences, male elite amateur weight lifters had higher testosterone levels for more explosive strength, while male elite cyclists had lower testosterone than the weight lifting and non-athlete groups, but were on top for endurance performance. 
Basing the ability to compete or not on the variance of a natural hormone that is one ofin many factors determining athletic performance is not a strong or fair basis for anyone in any sport. 
In competitve surfing, many forget that cisgender women are not treated the same as men to this day. It was only last year that women were able to compete at Pipeline in a Championship Tour event. This was based largely in the belief that women could not handle a heavy wave like that, even though women have been charging for years on the North Shore. Many people have to realize that these same ideas about cis women, which are just as prevalent and pervasive, are being recycled to demonize trans women.

Student filmmakers and language professors gathered in Taper Hall Wednesday night for USC’s first Multilingual Film Festival. The screening of six short films in six different languages was complete with laughter, applause and support from the multilingual community, truly demonstrating how learning about other languages and cultures can bring people closer.
The Multilingual Film Festival was hosted by the Center for Languages and Cultures and organized by its Community Outreach Committee as an initiative to bring awareness to the importance of studying foreign languages, particularly to cultivate appreciation and understanding for other cultures. Professor Maria Mercedes Fages Agudo, master lecturer in Spanish and chair of the Community Outreach Program, explained that organizers chose to organize a film festival because of the medium’s accessibility. 
“We thought ‘These days, you know, students walk around with their phones, and they’re always photographing, videotaping, watching TikTok,’ so it looked like the natural transition would be to ask them to produce a video where they were using the target language we use in the classroom, but outside of their normal four walls,”  Fages Agudo said.
As audience members and filmmakers hurried to the event, they were warmly greeted by either Professor Fages Agudo or Evgeny Dengub, professor of Russian and director for Center of Languages and Cultures.
“I hope that [audience members] will take away that language is fun, and that using a foreign language is something they don’t just do in the classroom when they study a verb or conjugations, but it’s something that helps them discover and open up their creative potential and bring more joy to the world,”  Dengub said.
While staffers prepared the screening, Professor Dengub taught the audience of around 40 to say “Hello” in the six languages that were represented in the Film Festival: Arabic, Chinese, German, Hebrew, Russian and Spanish.
After opening remarks, the films began to play. The theme of the film festival was “A Day in the Life of a USC student,” which Professor Fage Agudo explained was chosen for its universality.
“Teaching so many languages at so many different levels, how could we find a topic that could be the same for every language that we are teaching?” Professor Fages Agudo said. “We thought “A Day in the Life of a Student” would be an easy one to connect to.”
First was the Arabic language film, “Empty,” made by Faatima Abdul-Aziz, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, and Anthony Khoory, a senior majoring in sociology. Khoory explained that their video about an aspiring actress and her strained relationship with her husband was inspired by the style of Arab soap operas.
“I looked at Arabic musalsal, which are television dramas,” Khoory said, “and we actually used the theme song from a Turkish show … and used the idea of like divorce and big family topics and cultural elements.”
Next was the Chinese language film, “The Power of Chinese,” made by Yana Savitsky, a sophomore majoring in media arts and practice, Vihan Raj, a junior majoring in computer science, Rich Qian, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and David Zheng, a junior majoring in game and interactive media design. Their film explores a rivalry between two students in a Chinese class, and how their competition escalates to comedic effect. 
After that was the German language film, “Stress Traum,” made by Justin Compy, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, and Schuyler Gebhardt, a senior majoring in history. Their film follows a student studying for a test in his German class who falls asleep and has a nightmare about the exam.
Next was the Hebrew language film, “End,” made by Jack Yonover, a sophomore majoring in philosophy. His film is about a student going through his day, struggling with feelings of hopelessness.
Then the Russian language film, “How to Find Friends in Strange Circumstances,” made by Marguerite Bysshe, a freshman majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, Christopher Keating, a senior majoring in theatre, Claire Fausett, junior majoring in international relations and Russian, Sophia Wittmeier, a senior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations, and Christopher Gunning, a senior majoring in Russian, was streamed. The video is about a Russian language student who transforms into the Russian cartoon character “Cheburashka” after studying the character for a project.
Bysshe, the group’s director, explained the motivation behind their film. “I know I wanted to do something funny and I love Cheburashka… I learned about [him] in my high school Russian class.”
Finally, the Spanish language film “I like USC!,” made by Alana Bright, a junior majoring in theatre, and Bianca Novak, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, was played. Their film documented their day as USC students.
All along, the audience applauded and laughed, showing support for one another’s works. Afterward, Professor Fages Agudo and Professor Dengub held a Popular Choice vote, which “How to Find Friends in Strange Circumstances” won.
After the audience decided the winner of the Popular Choice award, there was a separate award ceremony to celebrate the movies. The winners were decided by a jury from the Community Outreach Committee and presented by teaching fellow Steven Gonzalez. Gonzalez explained that the films demonstrated the strength of the language program at USC. 
Among these awards, Best Acting went to Abdul-Aziz and Khoory for “Empty.” Best Cinematography went to “Stress Traum.” Funniest Film went to “How to Find Friends in Strange Circumstances.” Best Film went to “Stress Traum” in third, “Empty” in second and “How to Find Friends in Strange Circumstances” in first. 
The winners were given small Academy Award-esque statues for their wins and pictures were taken. The audience applauded all the filmmakers once again, and the night ended with a trivia game for free T-shirts which, albeit competitive, was very fun.
With the success of this Multilingual Film Festival, Professor Dengub hopes that the initiative will become an annual event and that even more students of the 15 languages offered at USC will participate, emphasizing that the medium of film can help learners bridge language barriers. 
“The language of cinema is pretty much universal,” Professor Dengub said, “and with the help of subtitles you could really, you know, make a film in any language and enjoy [it].”

The rivalry was heated as ever, with hundreds of Trojans chanting “UCLA SUCKS!” as the Spirit of Troy opened the night with the Trojan fanfare — a tune most students can hum in their sleep — at Conquest Thursday. Clad in cardinal and gold, the band rocked the excited gathering while the USC football team took the stage. 
USC redshirt senior offensive lineman Justin Dedich and sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock passionately rallied the crowd to show up for Saturday’s game against UCLA. The victory bell at the Rose Bowl has been blue for a year now, which is “one too many,” Dedich and Bullock reminded the crowd. Trojans jumped up and down with hands in the air as the team threw t-shirts into the audience. 
But this was just the beginning. The hungry crowd was about to feast as several student organizations took the stage, putting their Trojan spirit, excellent dancing and musical skills on full display. Many groups performed, but what the onlooking crowd got most excited about were the dance troops — the Cardinal Divas, Break Through, USC Cheer, and Spade A Dance. 
The audience, which flocked around the stage and featured hundreds of “fucla” shirts, was jolted with electricity when these groups took the stage. The Cardinal Divas, USC’s first majorette team, electrified the event with their stunning performance and connection with the audience. Crowd members mimicked the Divas’ signature moves and called for an encore as soon as the music ended. Alas, there was no time for a repeat performance as so many other groups were still lined up. 
The diversity of USC’s talent was on full display as Spade A Dance, USC’s K-pop dance crew, and Mariachi Los Troyanos de USC, USC’s official mariachi band, took the stage after the Divas. The enthralling lineup seemed never-ending, with performances from USC Cheer and Break Through, USC’s hip-hop dance team, as well. 
Once this captivating set of performances was over, the crowd had a chance to take a breather and check out the ferris wheel and food trucks set up at McCarthy Quad. This laid-back environment did not last for long, however. 
Students rushed back to the stage when New York City-based artist DJ_Dave lit up the stage with her electronic-pop music. Her tunes are like no other because she uses code to make her music — a style called algorave. In front of the frenzied crowds in McCarthy Quad, she live-coded music while mixing it at the same time. She summoned songs live on-stage via her laptop screen, which was projected behind her. In front of a future-psych background, she immersed the audience in her funky algorave music, accompanied by singer Maddy Davis’ vocals.
The beats were not coming to a close anytime soon. After DJ_Dave bowed out with her hit tracks, GRAMMY award winner Mura Masa, a multi-instrumentalist electronic-pop artist, took the stage. Mura Masa has worked with an impressive slate of artists including chart-toppers like Stormzy, Charli XCX, A$AP Rocky and PinkPantheress. The audience and Mura Masa vibed together in synergy as the artist played his hit songs like “1 Night” featuring Charli XCX and “Love$ick” featuring A$AP Rocky.  
This year, Conquest was a jubilant occasion. The night closed with fireworks as hundreds of excited Trojans rallied to support the football team in their matchup against the Bruins at the Rose Bowl. Their best wishes and prayers came to fruition, as the Trojans beat the Bruins in an exhilarating match 48-45 Saturday.

In this day and age, electric scooters are the worst modern invention to ever plague college campuses. They take up space, they’re safety hazards and, quite frankly, I feel mocked when they speed past little old me on my skateboard. Yes, they’re a fun alternative to driving and public transportation, and are technically pretty useful. No matter how hard I push on my skateboard, an electric scooter will always beat me to my destination in half the time — even with my brand new cruiser wheels. But at what cost?
I write this not because I am bitter, but because I fear for the wellbeing of my fellow Trojans. The number of electric scooter crashes I have witnessed and heard about have been innumerable. They’re hard to maneuver and there’s no way to make a quick turn on one — in turn putting the thousands of pedestrians on campus in imminent danger. I’ve seen the fear on people’s faces when an electric scooter zooms by a little too close. 
On a less melodramatic note, a friend of mine recently got into an electric scooter accident at an intersection. He was on his longboard, and the other person careened into him at a much higher speed. Not only were there no DPS officers nearby to help, seeing as it was the middle of the day, but he ended up needing stitches, while the scooter user left with barely a scratch. 
Accidents like these are a lot more common — and painful —  than you might think. An analysis conducted by UCLA from Sept. 1, 2017, to Aug. 31, 2018 found that 249 people involved in electric scooter accidents needed medical care, and a third of those people required hospital attention. Most accidents were the result of falls, collisions or riders getting hit by moving vehicles or objects. Yikes.
This is such an issue, in fact, that Los Angeles lawmakers proposed to temporarily ban the widely-loved vehicles in July 2018. They cited the influx of accidents, and L.A. residents complained that scooter riders were using sidewalks and putting pedestrians in danger despite sidewalk riding being illegal in California. The city opted to issue cease-and-desists to popular scooter companies such as Bird and Lime, rather than a strict legal demand, which, due to their increasing popularity, would have been much more difficult to implement. 
I’m not saying no one should own an electric scooter. I often find myself a little jealous of electric scooter owners, especially when having to find the strength to skate home after a late night study session at Leavey. I am arguing, however, that people should be a little more cautious when riding them. Seeing as our campus is so ideally flat and walkable — unlike a certain hilly rival that just so happens to also be in L.A. — USC has a pretty high number of pedestrians. 
At high traffic points in the day, no one should be scootering across a crowded intersection. While everyone’s rushing to and from class and focusing on where they have to be in the next ten minutes, not fully paying attention to their surroundings, it’s simply too dangerous to be moving at that speed among so many people. I honestly would argue the same for people on skateboards, bikes or anything other than their own two feet. 
While I love my skateboard, despite it being less of a hazard than a scooter, I always pick it up at the Village intersection to and from my 12:30 class at CPA — I’ve come far too close to taking both myself and someone else out not to. So if you ride an electric scooter, do yourself and everyone else a favor: invest in some comfier walking shoes, and walk it across that intersection. Get those steps in and avoid an intersection disaster — it’s a win-win situation.

The world’s richest man never ceases to surprise us. In his latest endeavor, Elon Musk bought Twitter at $44 billion with the aim of promoting absolute free speech — but not before trying to back out of the deal and negotiate a lower price first. In short, his big mouth landed him in the boss chair of one of today’s largest social media companies. Don’t get me wrong, Musk isn’t all bad. His push for sustainability and contributions in driving the world of technology are admirable, but his arrogance and spontaneous ideas have led him to make careless and even stupid mistakes that don’t go without consequences.  
Within 12 hours of Musk finalizing his purchase, the use of the n-word on Twitter increased by nearly 500 percent. But seeing how he named his son, I’d say social norms and political correctness don’t really apply to him. Now Musk’s got holocaust deniers and racists celebrating his takeover and about half the world hates him — including even Tesla stock owners.  
Among the newest anti-Muskers are Twitter’s former executive board members and about 3,700 employees whose jobs are being threatened by the layoff process and replacement with Tesla engineers. Those who haven’t been fired have been working extended hours without extra pay. Now you might be thinking, “Oh no, a bunch of millionaires were fired! Big deal,” and you’re perfectly right about the executives. However, for the engineers who were laid off as major tech companies such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Apple froze their hiring, Musk couldn’t have been more insensitive.  
After seeing immense success in his tech ventures, Musk seems to believe he can find a better way to run any business. After all, he founded SpaceX with no prior knowledge of building rockets and self-learned astrophysics. Running a social media company, on the other hand, isn’t rocket science, which sounds like good news until you remember that understanding people is as natural to Musk as decency is to former President Trump. Besides, it’s all fun and games until tin-foil hat wearers start to spew paranoid tweets about Musk controlling minds with StarLink or NeuraLink — I’m sure it’ll happen eventually.  
To his credit, it’s truly a wonder how Musk remains so optimistic about people. At every step of the way, his work with Tesla has been met with resistance from oil companies, combustion engine car manufacturers and non-believers. SpaceX almost went bankrupt after too many tests ended in failure. If anyone has the resilience to revive Twitter, it’s Musk, but he really shouldn’t have dabbled with it in the first place.  
With nothing but an ideal and $44 billion, Musk has begun to mansplain the concept of absolute free speech on a high profile social media platform. If he had just kept his mouth shut, and focused on his preexisting goals — you know, the easier ones, like sending a person to Mars — Tesla stock wouldn’t be plummeting, AOC wouldn’t be complaining about an $8-a-month subscription plan and my news feed wouldn’t be inundated with Musk’s name. Jokes aside, he has much greater plans to attend to than tinkering with social media.
But I suppose even geniuses blunder from time to time. It’s just that in Musk’s case it cost him a fortune and a massive publicity headache. Hopefully, he’s learned his lesson and we’ll just leave it there, because I’m sure he hasn’t. But who knows, maybe he’ll turn things around and incorporate Twitter software into Tesla cars. If Musk could use Twitter features and charge a subscription fee, that could help with his debt and bolster his growing tech empire.  And that’s not even considering the political influence he now wields as the owner of the online town square. It’s amazing what Musk has accomplished so far and, whether amazing or atrocious, his work with Twitter will be another one for the history books. Whether it ends in success or not, it’s time that he buckles down and focuses on more pressing goals than toying with new projects.

The Marshall School of Business and Viterbi School of Engineering will offer a new major beginning Fall 2023, which will allow students to explore the intersection between business and artificial intelligence. 
The new program, titled Artificial Intelligence for Business, will be offered under Marshall but will incorporate coursework from both schools. The schools jointly announced the program in early September.
Kimon Drakopoulos, assistant professor in data sciences and operations in Marshall, is expected to be the inaugural director of the program with Yolanda Gil, director of New Initiatives in AI and Data Science and research professor in computer science in Viterbi, as co-director. 
In an article published by Marshall, Gil commented on the groundbreaking educational opportunities the program will offer and how it aims to prepare the next generation of leaders in a rapidly changing technological world. 
“This is a pioneering and forward-looking interdisciplinary program. To our knowledge, it is the first in the world of its kind at this important intersection of AI and Business,” Gil said. “We will empower business and organizational leaders to understand the possibilities, as well as the limitations, of AI technologies and to help them better understand the people they serve, predict trends, and improve decision-making processes.”
Evelyn Engen, a junior majoring in business administration, said some students including herself were too far in their current program to change, but that she looks forward to the opportunities it will offer new students.
“I think it’s really cool. Personally, I wish I knew about it, because maybe it’s something that would have piqued my interest,” Engen said. “It feels like no one’s going to really bat an eye at it, especially the students who are already so far down the line, like me as a junior, who already completed most of the coursework [for their major] … I feel like for the kids that are applying, [it] absolutely [will be sought after], since AI is something so fresh and not talked about enough.” 
University staff has expressed excitement about what this means for USC as an institution that lends itself to exploring the intersection between fields. In late September, Marshall announced the updated Business of Cinematic Arts program. Dean of Viterbi Yannis C. Yortsos said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that he felt USC was the perfect fit for the new Artificial Intelligence for Business major, because of the University’s status as a hub for interdisciplinary studies. 
“USC is actually ideally suited,” Yortsos said. “USC has about 20-plus schools. You have cinema, law, pharmacy, you name it … No university that I’m aware of has this multiplicity of different disciplines, which for a long time have been growing, not isolated, but in their own silos in some sense. However, I think you have here the opportunity to create all these joint interdisciplinary efforts … I think that’s really what, ideally, one should aim at.” 
Yortsos said the new AI for Business program will feature a wide variety of courses, ranging from cognitive psychology and machine learning to marketing, with the intent of creating the next generation of business leaders with an interest in the technological sphere.
“[The program] is essentially creating a new breed of professionals who have a very strong quantitative background and are interested in business,” Yortsos said. “This is for students who want to have not only the inclination, but also the preference to have this combined dual identity.”
Drakopoulos, in the Marshall article, said the current challenge for AI is in its application, but that USC has the means to create this new generation of leaders. 
“We will be one of only a handful of universities around the globe where students have the opportunity to develop their technical, business and leadership skills to pursue careers in one of the fastest-growing parts of the tech sector,” Drakopoulos said.
Engen said the new joint program was right at home at USC and that she looks forward to more collaborations between schools, citing a friend who ultimately chose USC because it offered a specific program he wanted. 
“[The University] also has a coding and business major,” Engen said. “I had a friend who was transferring from a prestigious community college and he was looking to go to an elite school and he was looking at Cal, which is his dream school, but they didn’t offer the dual major of coding and business, but we did at USC, and that’s why he chose to go there.”
The need to study AI and business together is something that Yortsos said has come with the two previously separate fields becoming entwined, speaking to the importance of how AI can redefine higher education. 
“There is a convergence of areas that in the past were siloed but now I think they’re converging,” Yortsos said. “If you encouraged students to take a course or two in data science, [students] might understand why this is an important area. It may or may very well be part of the future of higher education.”

USC hopes to offer its first for-credit course to incarcerated students in Spring 2023, in partnership with the Dornsife Prison Education Project. Taught by Kate Levin and Nik De Dominic, USC PEP co-directors and associate professors of writing, “WRIT 320: Inside Out Writing Workshop” co-enrolls USC students with students in custody. 
Running for two semesters so far, the course previously only granted academic credit to current USC students. Students interested in this semester’s workshop can expect to focus on autobiographical writing while learning from one another in a rigorous, collaborative environment. 
The PEP began in 2011 at Cal Poly Pomona and has since expanded to reach 20 universities and 25 correctional facilities throughout California. Levin and De Dominic co-founded the USC chapter in 2017, which now serves as the PEP’s largest chapter in the nation. The nonprofit program serves system-impacted students through regular course offerings at multiple correctional and transitional living facilities.
“It’s called an inside-out class because it’s half USC students and half incarcerated students,” Levin said. “There’s lots of ways to get a GED or even associate’s degrees. We run across people in prison who have five associate’s degrees, but it’s pretty hard to get credit toward a bachelor’s so this is a great step. What we’d like to do with PEP … is offer a whole B.A. degree to people who are in prison. This can be a first step along the way.” 
Smaller liberal arts colleges in the U.S., including Pitzer, Emerson and Bard, offer a B.A. program to incarcerated people, but USC would be one of the only private R1 universities to offer a BA program to incarcerated students, De Dominic said.
“We’ve always seen the movement towards a B.A. program as an issue of equity,” De Dominic said. “Our USC students who are on-campus go into these spaces and there’s an experiential learning bend that they benefit from and our students who are in custody are obviously sort of enriched by the experience. But they don’t really get anything tangible in the way that our USC students do on campus.”
Previously, students in custody who took in-person USC PEP classes received rehabilitation achievement credits that lowered their sentence lengths. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation halted RAC credit during the pandemic, and the PEP is currently working to get it back. According to the USC PEP, incarcerated people who participate in prison education programs are 43% less likely to recidivate — relapse into criminal activity — than those who do not. 
This semester, USC PEP offered six courses that did not count for academic credit. The in-person courses include Film and Creative Writing, Film Studies, and Introduction to Debate. Courses held over Zoom included Creative Writing, Environmental Studies and Astronomy and Physics. All classes are led by professors and have six to eight student teaching assistants. 
“Our main mission is to build what we call the prison-to-college pipeline,” Levin said. “You’ve probably heard of the school-to-prison pipeline. We’re trying to reverse that and help make it easier for people who are in prison to access higher ed.”
In the spring of 2021, the USC PEP overtook the National Writing Contest for Systems Impacted Writers from the Underground Trojans — the oldest post-prison education advocacy group at USC. Submissions increased from around 100 in 2021 to over 600 in 2022. The USC PEP has awarded $10,000 per contest to winners. Writers who did not receive a cash award had their work published in the contest’s anthology.
With only eight winners annually, many writers were left seeking feedback on their work. This apparent need inspired Keziah Poole, who earned her Ph.D. in comparative literature at USC in 2021, to found and direct the USC PEP Readers Circle in February. Poole designed the program to support writers in custody beyond the 6 to 8 week writing courses USC PEP offers, as well as reach people who do not have access to programming in their facilities.
The program receives writing by mail from more than 150 authors from 26 states. The Readers Circle then scans and anonymizes the documents and logs the manuscript information. Documents are emailed out to more than 280 volunteers and they select and service a document by proofreading, copy editing, general feedback or digitization.
“By reading the works of incarcerated writers, we are telling them that their experiences matter and that they, like everyone else, have a right to be create and be heard,” Poole said. “It also presents USC  students with an opportunity to hear voices that they may not otherwise be exposed to, and to forge a human connection with someone through the power of writing.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the Prison Education Program is currently offering academic credit to incarcerated students. The project team is currently awaiting final approval to offer credit. A previous version of this story also stated that USC could be the first university in the country to offer a BA program to incarcerated people on a large scale. USC would be one of the only private R1 universities to offer such a program. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors. 
Correction: A previous version of this story failed to include the Underground Trojans’ work in starting the National Writing Contest for Systems Impacted Writers. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Seeing as this will be my last column of the semester, I thought I’d start things off by being upfront; the end of the year isn’t being too kind to me. And for the first time since the inception of this column, my problem isn’t related to grades. 
I’ve recently had to deal with some medical issues, making the last couple of weeks particularly tough as I navigated changing prescriptions and frequent visits to clinics. Because of that, I had to put a lot of things on hold, as I generally wasn’t feeling well enough to do much. Sadly, this column was one of the casualties, and if you are a careful reader, you probably already noticed that my absence lasted longer than the usual weekly period. I thank the kind editorial staff of the Daily Trojan for accommodating my necessities even though it certainly caused them a great deal of trouble. 
Thankfully, I’m feeling a lot better, and I’m ready to face finals with a newfound vigor, born only out of sheer dedication and the relief of not having to take dozens of pills daily. 
Still, this column isn’t about the slow and gruesome process of my recovery. Rather, it is about something that helped me power through as I spent my days feeling horrible in my apartment. Of course, I am talking about “God of War Ragnarök.” 
For those of you that don’t know, “God of War Ragnrarök” is the sequel to the highly acclaimed 2018 game “God of War”, which itself was already the fourth main installment in the long-running “God of War” series. In the series, we follow Kratos, a spartan soldier with a desire for vengeance against the Greek gods, as he systematically slaughters his way to the top of Olympus to catastrophic consequences. And while the first three games of the franchise were well known and loved by many for their puzzles, combat and most of all gore (seriously, don’t look them up if you have a weak stomach), the fourth installment featured a sort of “soft reboot”, as the game switched gameplay styles completely, with Kratos himself becoming a more mature character facing the hardships of parenthood in the new land of Norway. 
This new approach to the characters and the storyline yielded the 2018 game innumerable acclaim and awards, leaving fans desperate for the conclusion of its story. I too was one of these fans, who couldn’t wait to see what came next. And, almost as if on cue, its long-awaited sequel finally came out when I needed comfort the most. 
I’m happy to say, it didn’t disappoint. 
I won’t delve too deeply into the story, not only because there isn’t enough space to talk about everything, but also because I highly suggest you pick the game up for yourself. In general, it manages to pay off everything it set up in the previous game, and although there are a couple of kinks when it comes to some plot beats and characterizations, it still hones into what made the 2018 game amazing in the first place, focusing deeply on Kratos and his son Atreus’ relationship from every angle imaginable. 
The relationship is so well developed that after over 30 hours with these characters and a great resolution to the entire storyline, I am still left wanting more. Of course, this is not the first time that I’ve been attached so deeply to video game characters. But perhaps because I played it when I did, “God of War Ragnarök” has surpassed the level of normal well-crafted video game stories and become something more special to me: a reminder of why video games are great in the first place. 
This sort of reflection isn’t new for this column. I have previously used the final articles of the semester to talk about games that have impacted my understanding of the medium in general. But for “God of War Ragnarök,” there was no new knowledge gained nor a different perspective considered. What it did was reignite a passion for games that, after playing mediocre titles time and time again, was dwindling. By combining the very best elements of gameplay and utilizing video games’ unique ability to immerse the audience into a world, “God of War Ragnarök” etched itself into my heart like very few stories ever have, and certainly in a way unique to itself. 
Or at least I thought it was.
After speaking to my friends, I realized that, if you’ve been playing video games for a long time, you will come across titles that serve as encapsulations of a particular time and feeling in your life. In other words, you’ll find games that are more than just your “favorite games,” but rather hold a more sentimental value to you. And through recognizing the importance of these titles, you (hopefully) begin to understand a little bit about who you are as a person. Because, even if these games vary wildly in genres or formats, their one connecting thread is that something about the experience of playing them touched you deep down as a person, whether it is the well-crafted story or the hours of matches you’ve played with a group of friends.
So, as finals approach us, take the time to go back to these titles and draw on the comfort that they gave you. It certainly will not be the same as you remember, but if they truly have managed to leave an impact on you, you may find yourself gaining new experiences from them. And perhaps, as this new “God of War” has shown me, knowing that there are still new experiences like that is all the comfort you need.
