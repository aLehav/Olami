More than 400,000 Angelenos voted to elect Rep. Karen Bass, 69, as the 43rd mayor of Los Angeles in a 53% to 47% race. She is the first woman and the second Black politician to hold the office.
Bass, a 2015 graduate of the Dworak School of Social Work, overwhelmingly defeated opponent property developer Rick Caruso, also a USC alum. 
The Los Angeles County Registrar spent over a week tallying and confirming close to two million ballots, though reporting only about 760,000 votes for mayor. Preliminary election night results showed Bass and Caruso about even in polls before Caruso overtook her by a slight margin. Bass took a lead on Nov. 11 and has maintained strength since then as absentee ballots increasingly voted in her favor.
When Bass announced her candidacy last year on Sept. 27, public opinion favored her strongly over Caruso at 22% to 6%, according to a Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates poll. Still, the race narrowed acutely as the Nov. 8 deadline approached. Bass received 43.1% of votes in the June 7 primary against Caruso’s 36%, advancing both to the Nov. 8 general election.
That gap narrowed after the primary elections. In August, voters favored Bass to Caruso 43% to 31%. In September, it shrunk again to 34% to 31%.
Late October polling by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found 45% of likely voters planned to vote for Bass compared to Caruso’s 41%. 
Aggressive advertising campaigns from both candidates likely played a part in predictive polling; this fall’s race is the most expensive mayoral race in L.A. history. Caruso spent over $100 million dollars — much of it his own — on his candidacy, compared to Bass’s $9 million, according to the L.A. City Ethics Commission’s Nov. 2 report.
Much of Bass’ advertising campaign focused on her extensive work in politics and lifelong Democratic party membership, countering Caruso’s platform as a non-politician.
Her work in government and community structuring began in the late 1980s. After graduating from the Keck School of Medicine’s Physician Assistant program in 1982 and CSU-Dominguez Hills in 1990, Bass formed the Community Coalition amid the crack-cocaine and gang violence crisis impacting the city at the time.
Since then, Bass has held numerous official positions in government. She represented California’s 47th State Assembly district from 2005 to 2008, during which she became the first Black woman elected as Speaker of the Assembly. Bass then served one term as a representative for California’s 33rd congressional district from 2011 to 2013. After redistricting, Bass served the 37th congressional district from 2013 to 2020, leaving office to run for mayor.
Bass has received endorsements from Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary Hillary Clinton. Both California Senators, Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein, have endorsed her, in addition to an official endorsement from the L.A. Times.
Bass ran on a platform that largely targeted the city’s homelessness crisis, emphasizing additional public safety and crime prevention measures. She vowed to house at least 15,000 Angelenos by the end of her first year, build additional temporary and permanent housing units and increase job programs for people experiencing homelessness.
Bass also stated intentions to hire more police officers and restore LAPD to its full capacity, as well as establish an Office of Community Safety within the mayor’s office.

President Hannah Woodworth provided a monthly update at Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting. 
Woodworth shared updates about last month’s launch of SCÜP, the USC-Los Angeles International Airport shuttle. Of the 1,430 available tickets offered for Fall Break, 1,250 were claimed. Of these reservations, SCÜP approximates that nearly 900 students took advantage of the service. SCÜP hopes to capture 25% of total demand by the end of the year — approximately 9,000 students. To meet their goal, the service will need to increase ridership by upwards of 30% during Thanksgiving Break. Six hundred students have already signed up for shuttle transportation in anticipation of the break. 
“It’s getting a little bit challenging since the days people are leaving is spread over a longer period of time,” Woodworth said. “Students are leaving Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday or even missing the whole week, so it’s not as much of an isolated concentrated time but I believe we’re only running the shuttle next Tuesday and Wednesday.” 
Since her last update, Woodworth has met with eight more student leaders to conduct qualitative interviews about how to best connect student organizations with USG resources. Woodworth plans to conduct four to nine more interviews before the next administration to include in her report. 
“This is to get a better gauge of students,” Woodworth said. “We want to see how can we improve and better identify systemic qualities because we ran our platform a year ago.”
Woodworth presented other project updates, including celebrating Labor Appreciation Day in support of service workers on campus, USG election reform and hosting workshops with the Gould School of Law to help students learn about their rights. She also discussed administrative roundtables USG will lead starting Thursday about how to secure off-campus housing. Woodworth also called to create a private fund for undocumented students who are ineligible for paid university jobs per federal guidelines. 
Woodworth also announced goals for the Spring 2023 semester to improve USG’s crisis communication groups by creating a communication guide to better direct where and how to respond to internal and external crises. USG plans to establish permanent transition guides for incoming USG officers and host discourse workshops to combat increased tensions on campus. 
“We had heightened issues this past year from roommate conflicts,” Woodworth said. “More [students] are willing to bring the issue up with Residential Assistants or upper-level administrators versus just talking it out with their roommate, even for low-level issues. So we want to encourage students to talk to each other more and hopefully be able to work these issues out on their own.”
Senator Sam Nadol provided project updates, including on the USCard integration with Apple Wallet. 
“We’ve had a lot of really exciting conversations on that,” Nadol said. “I’ve met with services on this team, as well as Apple and we’re really excited about getting this going.”
Nadol also spoke about updates on providing reusable to-go containers for dining halls, putting recycling bins on the Row and helping increase sign-ups for SCÜP over Thanksgiving Break. 
Chair of accessibility Juliana Melendez shared that the Accessibility Committee’s mission is to remove accessibility barriers for all USC students. The committee has also been working to draw in registered student organizations’ participation and support. 
Melendez shared three additional project updates, including making class recordings of lectures available for all students and streamlining the process across the University. Their next step is  to collect anonymous student testimonials on the experience of virtual learning. Other projects include Accessibility 101, a project to increase the student body’s understanding of accessibility, how to be an ally through social media and creating a consolidated reporting form to streamline the process and increase transparency.

It’s 11 p.m., Nov. 29, 2021. Puteaux, France — right on the west side of Paris, where the last stop on the metro lies. A girl is sitting in a 17th-floor apartment the size of a shoebox, registering for her spring classes at USC. The window is popped open, even though it’s 35 degrees outside, and some horrendous meal is cooking on a little electric stove. She doesn’t know yet that the time she’s spent here, about to come to a close, will change her life forever.
I’m a spring admit at USC, now a sophomore in my second semester on campus, an editor at the Daily Trojan and away from Paris, the place I had the privilege of studying abroad during my unique fall semester. As a Los Angeles County native, raised in a small beach city merely 45 minutes from this campus, my one goal when applying to college was pretty straightforward — leave California.
Some luck I have.
USC, prized for the public policy and journalism programs I inevitably became so passionate about, turned into a second home. As time passed, this University I was destined to attend has become a place that I find more and more perfect for the person I’m turning into — but only after I reckoned with the turmoil of being a spring admit to the Sol Price School of Public Policy. As a spring admit, I thought I would get left behind compared to the students who started in the fall; that maybe it would be harder to meet new people, join clubs, get housing or figure out how to tackle this new independent life with a whole host of eating restrictions that loomed darkly over me when I thought of eating at a dining hall.
Now, I’ve learned that my late start at the University was truly a lifeline.
Prior to the fall of 2021, I would’ve never considered myself a person who learns by doing or through experience. I am by nature a very stubborn person who has been told a multitude of times that I “think I have all the answers.” I’m unlearning that now, in more ways than one — or well, I’m trying to at least.
Had it not been for my fall Paris experience, and technically, a single admissions decision on my file, my entire outlook on life would be on a completely different plane. 
I never would’ve fallen in love with my major quite the same way as I did when I took an efficient metro system to school, and saw the mental health benefits that came from living in a walkable, pedestrian-centered city like Paris — I worked hard to understand new local policies and saw the effect it had on my life in the four months I got to spend there. 
Because I was a foreigner, plunged into a new environment where I truly wanted to fit myself into local life (and not stick out as French-despised American tourist), I now see the policies I study every day not just as laws meant to keep order, but rather — as corny as it sounds — the building blocks of a beautiful life. And the several spring-admitted classmates I’ve got? They bring me to Dauterive Hall every day with a smile.
Hell, had it not been for being a spring admit, I wouldn’t have experienced the beautiful challenge of living in a place where I didn’t speak the language and gained a very personal appreciation for those whose first language doesn’t come from where they now live — including my two parents, whose presence (and frequent requests for me to look over their work emails for English spelling mistakes) I learned to really miss while I was gone.
Even later on, had it not been for being a spring admit, I wouldn’t have been assigned with dozens of other spring admits to live in Troy Hall, where I made some of my best friends — one, who also did the Paris program, even became my significant other.
Had it not been for being a spring admit, I wouldn’t have come to terms nearly as quickly with a harsher reality — a rare eating disorder that, for my entire life, was mistaken as picky eating. Had it not been for me living alone in that tiny Paris apartment cooking everything I ate, I wouldn’t have sought out help as fast as I did or valued my physical well-being like I do now. I wouldn’t have started unlearning the guilt I felt about not eating “normally” the same way if I wasn’t 5,000 miles away from home, with only myself to hold me accountable.
Because of the uncertainty that many, including myself, felt when they saw an online, confetti-filled letter saying I had to start in January rather than August, I am a stronger woman from the path it led me down. A more independent human being. A kinder person, especially towards myself. A little wiser.
Funny how a single semester’s delay can cement so many things like that.
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world.

Tables lined the McCarthy Quad and the Trousdale Campus Entrance Tuesday for USC’s second-ever Trojan Marketplace, after its organizing group received  over 80 vendor applications within a week.
Spark SC, a student organization dedicated to building a better entrepreneurial ecosystem at USC, held the first marketplace in the USC Village last April. Following the event’s success, the organization began planning its sequel in the new McCarthy Quad location to foster its growth.
Sarah Hakim, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering and committee lead for Trojan Marketplace, described what makes Spark different from other student business organizations. 
“It’s mostly focused on redefining entrepreneurship and approaching entrepreneurship in an innovative way,” Hakim said. “A lot of our initiatives aren’t necessarily based on startups or businesses, it’s more just promoting entrepreneurship.”
After noticing that many small businesses on campus lacked digital exposure and community funding, the idea for Trojan Marketplace was born. In partnership with Hakim, junior Erik Cruz founded Trojan Marketplace.   
Spark vowed to create an equitable event that all could participate in. Many flea markets typically charge vendors a down payment or take a percentage of their profits, but vending at Trojan Marketplace comes at no cost to the vendor due to the event’s sponsors, the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and The Lorenzo. 
“We don’t want money to be a reason someone doesn’t participate, so we’ve made it completely free,” Hakim said. 
But Spark wanted to break down more than just financial barriers. 
“The really big thing behind it was that we had people who were a minority selling for the first time, and more than half of our vendors [were] women,” Hakim said. “It tapped into a community that isn’t usually given this opportunity.”
Hakim noted that these goals were all kept in mind when reviewing vendor applications.
Dani Eustaquio, a junior majoring in business administration and founder of SageRoseCo, applauded Spark for giving student businesses a platform. Eustaquio has been making jewelry for over two years and just recently launched her own website. 
“A lot of the things that these entrepreneurs sell are targeted towards college students, and I think this is the perfect platform to get your name out there and promote your business,” Eustaquio said. 
Spark intends to make the marketplace a regular event, with two to three occurring per semester. But they faced a few added roadblocks to their agenda. This year, the Spark committee in charge of the Trojan Marketplace had to register the event as a student organization in order to receive funding. 
“We know that the first time someone does something, it really paints a picture for the rest of the way they ever go about it,” Hakim said. “We want to give these people a really, really positive first time experience.“
After putting a halt to her production over sustainability concerns, Farnaz Behdinan, a junior majoring in business administration and owner of FarnieDesigns, is excited to share her passion with the world once again. 
“The experience of selling your work is so fun,” Behdinan said. “It’s like you’re giving a part of yourself to someone else, and it feels amazing.” 
Behdinan and Eustaquio agree that while some business tactics are learned from the textbook, much of what they’ve learned has come from their hands-on work. 
“The whole experience of being a small business owner is just a huge learning curve,” Eustaquio said. 
Students who attended the marketplace enjoyed a first-hand look at the talents some of their peers have, like Jasmine Jiwani, a freshman majoring in business administration.
“After going to Trojan Marketplace, I’m really hopeful for the opportunities I’m going to have throughout my time here, because I feel like this is so creative,” Jiwani said. 
Spark hopes that through continued events like the marketplace, the organization can foster the foundation for USC student entrepreneurs to accomplish their dreams. 
“We really believe that these people are going to go on to be huge fashion designers, restaurant owners and business owners,” Hakim said. “We just want to be a part of their beginning.”

More than a high school football game, the East Los Angeles Classic brings together the East L.A. community to cheer on history. The rivalry is played out among two of the first high schools established in Eastside L.A., James A. Garfield Senior High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School. As a longstanding rivalry since 1925, the same year as Garfield’s establishment, it has been a tradition in the East L.A. community for almost a century. 
On Oct. 21 2022, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum lit up in red and blue as the Black Eyed Peas performed during halftime of the 2022 edition of the East L.A. Classic. The stands of the Coliseum were packed 45,000 strong as alumni, students and East L.A. residents cheered on the Garfield Bulldogs or Roosevelt Rough Riders. 
“The Classic” officially got its title in 1972, and from that point forward, it served as both schools’ homecoming games. The game was initially played on either schools’ football field, but it eventually became challenging to accommodate the countless spectators on the school’s grounds due to its growth in popularity throughout the years. To account for the game’s growing attendance, the Classic was moved to the East Los Angeles College stadium, where the audience reached up to 25,000 in past years. 
2022 marked the first year the matchup took place at the L.A. Coliseum since 2003. In addition to the over 45,000 tickets sold this year, artists like Becky G and Big Boy were in attendance to show their support for the community’s tradition. The popularity of the game draws celebrities to perform and spectate, and the sheer number of people that attended demonstrates how the community eagerly awaits the chance to embrace tradition and to reunite with their high school classmates. 
The Classic is noted for the success of its participants; on October 27, 1961, in the East L.A.Stadium, Mike Garrett scored six touchdowns for Roosevelt High School. In 1965, he won the Heisman Trophy as a halfback for USC football. 
In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic resulted in the game’s postponment until the spring, although ultimately the game was canceled after the pandemic worsened. Before then, the last event to cancel the Classic was World War II. 
The first year back after the cancellation in 2020, the schools did not forget to commemorate those especially important to the Classic. Both teams had lost beloved members of their community; returning to the field would never be the same. Beloved by students at Roosevelt High School, the passing of former assistant football coach Richard “Dickie” Guillen rocked the community in the midst of the already devastating pandemic. In memory of him, the players wore stickers at the 2021 Classic, stating “All Work, No Glory” — the favorite saying of Guillen. The Classic also recognized the passing of Garfield alumni and former football player No. 40 Danny “Tank” Vargas with 40 seconds of silence. In bracing against grief, it’s important to never forget loved ones, and East L.A. does this perfectly in returning to traditions and reassuring care for one another.
East L.A. is a neighborhood filled with culture and tradition, with the largest Chicano population in the nation. Every year, Bulldogs and Rough Riders are ready to take on the field, and the East L.A. community never fails to enthusiastically represent their colors each October. Cultural richness is rooted deep in East L.A., and its schools do not shy away from including that culture with the schools’ Mariachi bands (Mariachi Los Alanos & Mariachi Olimpico) included in the Classic’s press conference. 
As its popularity has grown, outlets like ABC7 News, CBS News, Fox 11 and the Los Angeles Times have reported on the event, writing about the days leading up to the game and its results. While everyone trickles in to watch regardless of who wins or loses, the event sets an example of how rivalry can bring together opposing teams. The Classic is a historical event that brings the Latinx community together and gives visibility to a marginalized community. 
The schools have also gained support outside the community, as the Los Angeles Rams in partnership with Nike donated $5,000 to each school’s football program and provided pep rally t-shirts this year. 
Due to gentrification, Los Angeles has seen steady erasure of neighborhoods’ cultures. Boyle Heights and East L.A. carry history and rich Chicano culture, with their schools integrating that culture into significant community traditions. Still, East L.A. is home to many Chicanos; when I am in the area, seeing what is still present, like shops, restaurants and homes, brings peace to mind that the culture is still present, too. It’s thrilling, then, to see such longstanding traditions as the Classic continue to fill stadiums. 
Traditions like the Classic carry beauty and strengthen communities, so as East L.A. continues to change it is imperative to maintain those traditions.

Student Health will expand its trauma-informed care model to include students who have been racially profiled, in accordance with Department of Public Safety Community Advisory Board recommendations in their report released in July. Recommendation No. 22 on the report calls for the University to “fund and create trauma-informed mental health resources, including counselors, to support and provide relief for the experiences of racially profiled students within Student Health Services.”
In a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman elaborated on the definitions and importance of trauma-informed care, and said Student Health has “for several years now” worked to implement appropriate practices.
“When we think about ‘trauma-informed’ [care], it’s just the recognition that many people have experienced trauma of all forms in their lives,” Van Orman said. “We know that racial profiling, racism, racial harassment is a form of trauma along with other forms of trauma. And we know that [with] people that have experienced trauma, that impacts how they interact with systems of care.”
Van Orman said Student Health was working to phase out an old model of trauma-informed practice in which medical professionals were trained to “ask people about their trauma” and “make them tell us about it” before adjusting their approach.
“What we thought about now is the idea of universal precautions, … where we recognize that many people may be coming into environments with trauma,” Van Orman said. “We want to create an environment where, regardless of your experience, we have precautions in place to prevent retraumatization.”
In a communitywide email Thursday, Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance Dr. Erroll G. Southers listed specifics on how the CAB’s recommendations are to be implemented: mental health staff will “have the ability to engage in 1.5 hours of monthly Trauma Consultation and Education Trainings”; all students seeking care at Student Health will be screened for racial trauma and can request a provider with expertise in culturally informed care; and Counseling and Mental Health Services will have clinicians embedded in Student Equity and Inclusion Program offices “to offer tailored support to the cultural centers.”
Training is “universal for our mental health staff,” Van Orman clarified during the briefing.
“We certainly want providers who have more experience with trauma, but it’s actually all of our staff [that] are doing [the training],” Van Orman said. “We’ve invested a lot of time in training and education over the last few years.”
Last Tuesday, California voters passed Prop. 31 — the California ballot measure upholding a bipartisan bill banning the sale of most flavored tobacco products. Van Orman said that the passing of the proposition is a “really positive step forward” and the ban would prevent “a lifetime of tobacco use” among minors, the target audience for such products.
“We know that tobacco-related illnesses are still one of the number one killers in our country,” Van Orman said. “The anti-smoking movement has been around so long that we believe it’s one of the great triumphs of public health; but we also believe that the work is done, [that] people no longer die of tobacco-related illnesses. And that’s actually just not true.”
The week ending Nov. 14 saw 136 coronavirus cases reported to Student Health, remaining “pretty flat” compared to 140 the week prior, Van Orman said. Wastewater testing from residential facilities are “still fairly positive and rising.”
A little over 3% of visits to Student Health the week ending Nov. 7 were for influenza-like illness, and 12.7% of samples tested positive for influenza, suggesting “elevated activity” of influenza on campus, Van Orman said.
“Flu activity is rising in California, but it’s also rising nationally,” Van Orman said. “So we are very concerned about people who are traveling [and] coming back with influenza.” 
Flu activity is highest in southern states: as of the week ending Nov. 5, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists activity level in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas as “Very High.” New York City, New Jersey and the District of Columbia are also designated as “Very High.” Activity in California remains “High” along with seven other states.
“If you watch flu activity, it tends to creep across the country,” Van Orman said. 
Van Orman urged people who are traveling over Thanksgiving Break to get vaccinated and wear masks during transit.

The 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) began earlier this month in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with an emphasis on helping developing nations build climate-friendly infrastructure. Across the Arabian Peninsula, the 2022 FIFA World Cup will kick off early Sunday morning in Qatar with 32 nations competing in the most popular sport on the world’s largest stage.
Disappointingly, voices in both countries are being silenced in the wake of these global gatherings.
Only 32 teams can qualify for soccer’s biggest national competition, which only occurs once every four years, but all United Nations member states can take part in the two-week conference with a focus on helping “those countries that have contributed least to the problem [but] are suffering the most,” according to Melbourne Climate Futures director Jacqueline Peel.
The problem is that some of these very countries, as well as non-governmental organizations whose advocacy has been vital in spreading global awareness of environmental issues impacting developing countries, won’t be in attendance. Not because they don’t want to, but because they can’t afford accommodation. 
Weeks before the conference, some potential attendees had their hotel reservations hiked up to prices 400 percent higher than the original cost. NGOs and groups from the least developed countries will be pushed out of this conference, which was dedicated in part to providing climate aid to the countries that need it most, with some countries in Africa experiencing their worst food crises in the last 40 years.
Additionally, organizers who can afford to make it to Sharm el-Sheikh could face difficulty protesting the issues that the conference should be addressing. A nearly decade-old campaign against Egypt’s reliance on coal was squashed by an Abdel Fattah al-Sisi-led government that has persecuted critics, journalists and human rights activists alike. 
Egypt, meanwhile, accounts for approximately one-third of Africa’s methane emissions and is doing little to transition away from its reliance on fossil fuels.
While the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is allowing Egypt a chance to “greenwash” itself in the public eye, the FIFA World Cup is an attempt by Qatar to “sportswash” its own questionable human rights record.
Qatar, who are alleged by the U.S. Department of Justice to have bribed FIFA officials for the chance to host the World Cup, built eight beautiful, high-tech stadiums that will comfortably seat thousands of fans with air conditioning to protect from the desert heat. Behind the alluring stadiums that any sports fan would be lucky to enter are thousands of trafficked migrant workers who build the stadiums in horrid and dangerous conditions.
Between working 14-hour days without proper time to rest or acceptable food provisions, many workers are being taken advantage of — with some noting that up to two-thirds of their salaries had simply disappeared. Because many workers are from different countries and worked for companies owned by Qatar’s ruling family, there has been fear among them to speak out against their harsh working conditions. 
“We were covered up by this big company owned by the royal family, despite FIFA having these standards,” Anish Adhikari, a Nepalese migrant worker, said in an interview with the Rolling Stone. “I felt very much intimated at every point — and if I took action, I would be sent back home. I was so scared.”
The bulk of Qatar’s economy comes from the oil-rich land the country sits on. Earlier this year, President Joe Biden declared Qatar a major non-NATO ally, aligning with the Biden Administration’s effort to ensure European nations would have access to oil amid the peak of the war in Ukraine.
In recent years, Qatar has made more efforts to establish itself as a tourist destination, including by hosting high-profile sporting events. Because of Qatar’s human rights violations, tourists should be wary of where their money is going — because it certainly isn’t going into the pockets of the laborers behind the epic stadiums and arenas.
As the COP27 draws to a close and the FIFA World Cup begins, it is easy to get lost in the austere present when countries from across the globe meet to plan against what should be a common and uniting enemy in climate change or celebrate a globally beloved sport. But in both countries, with both events, it is important to consider those whose voices are not being heard — and who is quieting them.

Friday night lights at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum began in a strange fashion. 
USC, a team that averages a tad under 500 yards of offense per game, had only 8 total yards in the first quarter against a Colorado team that allowed the 130th most — out of 131 schools — yards per game. 
Not an ideal start, but the Trojans turned it around, cruising to their ninth win of the season — the most in a season since 2017. And after University of Oregon lost Saturday, a USC win against UCLA this week means the Trojans would be in their first Pac-12 Championship game since 2020. 
There lies a big week ahead, but here are four takeaways from USC’s 55-17 victory:  
Travis Dye injury
Arguably the most important player for the Trojans this season has been redshirt senior running back Travis Dye. An injury to the running back late in the first half sent the Coliseum into dead silence, eerily similar to when leading receiver Drake London broke his ankle in late October last season, just two weeks before the Trojans’ matchup against UCLA.
Dye’s impact on this team has been clear. Head Coach Lincoln Riley said Dye was not only important for USC’s culture but their “competitive nature, the way [they] practice, the energy, the competitiveness, the physicality and the toughness.” 
“He was one of the key cogs in this team … making some real progress there. I think we all know that was something that had to happen here, and he was a central figure in that,” Riley said.
If those words weren’t enough, while being carted off the field, the entire USC sideline displayed Dye’s significance by coming out to check on him. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams stayed by Dye’s side while the running back was on the ground, telling him that he loved him. 
Finding a way to make up for Dye’s production will likely be a committee-based venture, which prompts the next takeaway. 
Who steps up in the running back room?
It will be challenging to replicate Dye’s play in the backfield, but the Trojans are fortunate to have three capable running backs who can step up in Dye’s absence — freshman Raleek Brown, senior Austin Jones and redshirt junior Darwin Barlow. 
Jones did the bulk of the work once Dye exited the game, carrying 11 times for 74 yards. After a 110 rushing yard performance against Fresno State in September, Jones’ production diminished. However, he is an experienced back having spent three seasons in the mix at Stanford.
Brown brings more flash to the backfield and is someone who can line up as a receiver or as a running back. His 52 rushing yards were a career-high. And remember Barlow? The transfer running back from last season has been buried in the depth chart, but he scored his second touchdown late in the game. 
Whether or not Barlow will be in the rotation is unclear, however, the backfield will look extremely different next week. 
A complete defensive game
Much of defensive coordinator Alex Grinch’s post-game comments after the Trojans’ victory against Cal were full of frustration. Grinch wasn’t happy, citing the inability of the defense to play a complete 60-minute football game.
“It’s a 60-minute football game. That’s not new. We signed up for that one when we decided to coach,” he said. 
It was less of that against the Buffaloes and more of USC getting on track defensively. Sure, it has to be noted that Colorado’s offense is among the worst in college football, scoring the third-fewest points per game at 15. 
But, the Trojans needed a confidence booster on that side of the ball going into tougher offensive matchups with UCLA and Notre Dame in two consecutive weeks. And for the most part, it seems like they did, allowing just 259 total yards of offense.
Junior defensive end Tuli Tuipulotu continued his dominant season. He had 2.5 sacks plus a forced fumble, putting his sack total for the year at 11 — the most in a single season by a Trojan since 2013. Sophomore defensive back Calen Bullock had his fourth interception of the season. We even saw sophomore rush end Korey Foreman, once the top recruit in the nation, get a tackle for loss. 
Most importantly, USC was never phased on the defensive side by the Buffaloes, which would have been a major concern. It was a simple game defensively.
“This is how we should play every week. We know we can do it, we just need to execute,” Tuipulotu said.
A holder’s flip
Up by 20 points, Riley opted for a fake field goal with redshirt junior punter Will Rose running in for a two-point conversion. The play was flashy in itself, but it was Rose’s backflip celebration that made it more special.  
The verdict is still out on Rose’s flip. 
“It’s like the angel and the devil sitting on each shoulder… There’s a part of me, where it’s like yeah you’re in L.A. and you run that in there and you flip that’s awesome,” Riley said. “And  there’s the other part where  now you to have to kick from the 20-yard line and you’re not real happy about it… But we’ll run him or roll him [or] something later on.”
Rose gets an A+ from me.

Taylor Swift’s latest album, “Midnights,” delivered an exciting range of songs that acted as a window into the artist’s late-night thoughts. With the release of her tenth studio album, Swift has solidified herself as a mainstay in pop. With this latest drop, one can’t help but reminisce on the days of Swift’s country style and curly hair or her kitten-filled and technicolor “Lover” era. In honor of her new tour, appropriately titled “The Eras,” here are some book recommendations based on your favorite swift album.
“Taylor Swift” —“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” 
by Jenny Han 
“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” follows high schooler and hopeless romantic Lara Jean Covey as she navigates academics and her hopes for love. Through the years, Lara Jean has written love letters to all the boys she’s loved in her past and keeps them signed, sealed but undelivered in a hatbox hidden in the back of her closet. But Lara Jean must deal with the fallout after discovering all the letters have somehow been mailed to her past crushes. It’s the perfect read to match Taylor Swift’s self-titled debut, which took listeners on a rollercoaster of first loves, self-realization and the exploration of identity through caring for others.
“Fearless” — “Counting Down With You” by Tashie Bhuiyan
Karina Ahmed knows what’s expected of her. All she has to do is keep her head down and adhere to her parents’ strict rules — no matter the cost. When her parents visit family in Bangladesh for a month, a simple lie sends Karina’s mundane life into a spiral. Instead of tutoring the resident rule-breaker, Ace Clyde, Karina makes a deal; for 28 days, she will pretend to be his girlfriend. But as the days count down, Karina can’t help but wonder if she and Ace are still acting. Exploring the themes of celebrating adolescence and falling in and out of love, fans of “Fearless” will find “Counting Down with You” to be a perfect read.
“Speak Now” — “Seven Days in June” by Tia Williams
Nothing is ever truly left in the past, and that’s the case for single mother and bestselling author Eva Mercy. Her past? None other than her passionate one-week fling named Shane Hall. Shane and Eva never thought they would see one another again. Yet, when both authors reunite at a literary event in New York, everything they left unsaid bubbles up to the surface. Fans of “Speak Now” will find that “Seven Days in June” matches perfectly with the themes of staying true to oneself and telling the truth before it’s too late.
“Red” — “History is All You Left Me” by Adam Silvera
Griffin never thought his ex-boyfriend, Theo, would leave him forever. He especially didn’t believe that he would attend Theo’s funeral. But he has, and he did. No one around him understands his grief except Jackson, Theo’s latest boyfriend. On a downward spiral with no way up, Griffin must confront history to make it out to the other side. “Red” explores the deterioration of people and relationships, and like ”History is All You Left Me,” provides a comforting reminder that loss, like all things, breeds new experiences.
“1989” — “The Raven Boys” by Maggie Stiefvater 
After discovering she was cursed to kill her true love with a kiss, Blue Sargent gave herself two rules: One, stay away from boys because they are trouble. And two, stay away from Aglionby boys because they are assholes. But she’s forced to abandon both when her family’s characteristic psychic powers finally manifest and she can see those destined to die. Richard Campbell Gansey III is undoubtedly alive — but not for long. Blue finds herself caught up with Gansey and his crew of friends on a quest to locate a Welsh king that just might lead them to find themselves instead. “1989,” Swift’s album of rebirth and self-reflection, preaches themes that ring true in the pages of “The Raven Boys,” and serves as its perfect mirror. 
“Reputation” — “Six of Crows” by Leigh Bardugo 
Kaz Brekker prefers following money rather than rules. He stalks the streets of Ketterdam, establishing dominance in every alleyway and street corner with no regard for authority. But when he’s offered the heist of a lifetime that promises riches beyond his wildest dreams, he cannot resist. He assembles the perfect team of misfits, and they might go down, but they’ll go down swinging. Fans of “Reputation” will root for anti-heroes once more in Bardugo’s “Six of Crows” duology. 
“Lover” — “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”

No one wants to recount all of the ridiculous things they did when they were 13, yet in their confessional podcast “Free Period,” best friends Sasha Spielberg and Alana Haim refuse to let the past die in all its glorious awkwardness. Every Tuesday, Sasha (one half of musical duo Wardell and also known as her solo alter ego Buzzy Lee) and Alana (member of the sister rock trio HAIM and star of “Licorice Pizza” (2021)) tell all about their regrettable 2000’s fashion choices, the humiliation of trying to join in with the cool kids and of course, their grand plans and romanticizations of their bat mitzvahs where the loves of their young lives would arrive on horseback and sweep them off their feet.
“When Alana and I first met, we asked each other ‘What were you like in 7th grade?’ because we think that is the most telling piece of information,” Sasha said in the debut episode.
The podcast is fresh on the scene, having premiered on Oct. 11, and the girls have already covered a spectrum of experiences ranging from middle and high school to beyond. Episodes have the feel of friendship bracelet making and midnight sleepover banter, and they span just the right amount of time to fill up a free period between classes.
Conversations are packed with laughter, second-hand embarrassment and an underlying bubbling love between Alana and Sasha, making it feel like you’re being let into their friendship circle. There’s a relaxed, honest and self-deprecating energy to their conversations, and they’ll often take turns into unexpected but welcomed tangents about forgotten childhood memories or strange occurrences that they only half-remember and need to fact check with their siblings. Many of the awkward experiences they discuss could be considered universal, but each week they bring new stories and new angles that make every episode a must-listen.
Out of all of their experiences, Sasha and Alana are most eager to share their golden stories about crushes, romance, and the insecurities they faced while trying to snag a seat with the cute boy at the lunch table. During their adolescent years, fulfilling their goal of getting a first kiss was about “as easy as discovering an element on the periodic table.” Their chronicles of dating struggles, wistful longing, and strange romantic fantasies are comforting and relatable—and it’s why they have the podcast. “This is like our therapy,” Alana joked.
The girls also bond over the ‘90s and ‘00s cultural backdrop of their middle school years, including their love for the TV show “Felicity” or experiences on MySpace. Los Angeles natives will be pleased by the plethora of shoutouts to teenage nightlife of the San Fernando Valley and namedrops of Sasha and Alana’s K-12 schools. And of course, the girls talk about their mutual experiences of Jewish girlhood, of making their way through the bar/bat mitzvah circuits, or the Jewish parent-isms they inherited into their adult lives.
Exciting guests have already chimed in on the conversation. Alana’s sister and bandmate Este Haim appeared in their second episode to banter about experiences with fake IDs and tell her story about the larger than life stunt she pulled at her middle school graduation. More recently, actress-writer-producer Rashida Jones joined in to discuss jumping ship from prank call escapades and feeling “uncool” when she was younger.
Spoiler alert, but Sasha and Alana made it out of their teenage years alive. They’ve both grown up to become successful artists, having achieved an aura of rockstar cool (Alana and her sisters were just named Glamour Magazine’s Women of the Year), and they’ve had their first kisses (Sasha is also recently married). The musicians give insight into their recent achievements while reflecting on the dreams of their girlhood, including the excitement of touring together and the serendipity of HAIM selling out the Hollywood Bowl, a place Alana and Sasha drove past their entire lives. But as they reveal, awkwardness is a perpetual affair. Even in these high moments, rest assured a costume malfunction will occur on stage to humble you, as Sasha recounts on one episode.
Alana and Sasha aren’t afraid to delve into the most awkward experiences of both their teenage and adult lives, making “Free Period” an opportunity to escape from overthinking your own everyday embarrassment and to allow someone else to process the emotions for you. It’s a reminder that at the end of the day, no matter how abominable a mishap can be, it will still make a great story. And that yes, it is more than valid that your middle school crush still intimidates you to this day, and that they likely will for the rest of your life.
New episodes of “Free Period” drop every Tuesday and are available to listen on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Audacy.

An assassination attempt Nov. 3 on former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan shocked Pakistanis in the mainland, abroad and at USC. On Nov. 3, the Haqeeqi Azadi March, a protest against the current Pakistani government led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, was interrupted when a gunman fired on an open container truck holding Khan and members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf political party. 
Khan, who serves as the chairman for PTI, sustained several bullet wounds in his leg and was taken to a hospital in Lahore for treatment. Fourteen PTI leaders and workers were injured and a PTI supporter was killed. 
Ahad Kajani, a junior majoring in business administration, is one of many Pakistani American students at USC. Kajani said that though his first reaction to the assassination attempt was concern for the former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, he was not surprised by the attack.
“Overall, I feel that this is indicative of the problem that Pakistan’s facing in that you’ve got two sides of the rhetoric at play,” Kajani said. “You’ve got the individuals who want to use religion to incite violence, and then you’ve got others who might be trying to attempt some real change.”
Violence against Pakistan’s heads of state is not unheard of. Since the country’s independence and formation in 1947, Pakistanis saw the on-stage assassination of their first Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, the hanging of former Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1979, the mysterious plane crash that carried President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in 1988 and a suicide bomb attack on former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. 
Sahrish Baloch, a junior majoring in computer science and business, recalled hearing about the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto when she was younger.
“It was very shocking for a lot of Pakistanis abroad and in the country because she was a good leader,” Baloch said. “It’s usually a pattern amongst the politicians that the general public actually likes versus the high profile individuals working in the government that are corrupt.”
Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed from office through a vote of no confidence. Even after his removal, Khan has maintained a strong support base in Pakistan and overseas.
“Imran Khan didn’t have a political upbringing as other politicians do. He started off in cricket and so a lot of people knew him from then,” Baloch said. “He slowly worked his way into politics and people have seen that because he’s been in stardom pretty much his entire life. They’ve seen his reputation, they’ve seen his character, and it’s a good character.”
Abeerah Siddiqui, a junior majoring in environmental science and public health and president of the USC Pakistani Student Association, said the political climate in Pakistan is very unstable, and it is possible that politicians fear Khan will return to his position in government.
“It’s very much based on what the politicians want. I don’t think they look a lot at what the people of the country need,” Siddiqui said, “It runs based on how the politicians want to run the country and what benefits they see fit for themselves.”
Khan and PTI leaders blame the Pakistani government and military leaders for  the attempt on his life, but these allegations remain unproven. Current Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly condemned the attack and directed the Interior Minister for a report about the incident. 
Despite the tumultuous situation Pakistan is facing, Kajani said it’s important that people do not think of Pakistan as just another country facing corruption.
“The issue is so much deeper than that,” Kajani said. “It’s about a country that’s struggling with a sense of national identity rather than just corrupt leaders. It’s about a country that’s trying to find itself.”
Kajani believes that the issues of polarity seen in Pakistan are comparable to the United States. 
“You take Punjab and Sindh, like how different these places are,” Kajani said. “It’s kind of similar to the U.S., where we’ve got vastly different cultures living in the same country trying to figure out how to move forward.”
Siddiqui said Pakistan’s political and environmental challenges — the country experienced mass flooding this fall , partially due to climate change — should not be brushed off.
“We need to pay more attention,” Siddiqui said. “People tend not to worry about it so much when it’s not directly impacting them.”
Since Khan’s removal from office in April, the former prime minister has led dozens of rallies and his supporters continue to organize protests in hopes that his position will be reinstated.
“I was really disappointed when he was kind of thrown out of office,” Kajani said. “I do see him trying to come back in, so I guess we’re going to see.”

Ambassador Masood Khan joined a group of university and high school students at Ralph and Goldy Lewis Hall Monday to discuss the diplomatic relationship between Pakistan and the United States — with a spotlight on how students and youth can play a significant role in shaping its future. 
Khan is a 71-year-old Pakistani diplomat who served as the 27th President of Azad Kashmir, a Pakistani-administered self-governing entity in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. He was Pakistan’s ambassador to China and Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations before he started serving as the ambassador to the United States in 2022. 
Khan began the discussion with a brief summary of the history of Pakistan-U.S. relations. In 1947, during the Cold War, Pakistan established diplomatic relations with the U.S. under the Truman presidency. Ever since then, the U.S. has played an important role in helping Pakistan develop its economy and military forces in its early stages. 
An alliance to fight the spread of communism was made between the two countries in the 1950s. After many wars in the Middle East, resulting in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Pakistan has led an effort to help the countries in these regions return to a norm defined by the United Nations. 
“I think that Pakistan [has played] a role in moving the entire international community towards democracy, towards a respect for human rights and towards respectful global norms,” Khan said. 
The USC Pakistani Student Association, the American Pakistani Youth Council and the USC Price Graduate Policy and Administration Community partnered to sponsor the discussion with Khan. 
Participants not only had the opportunity to hear from the ambassador himself, but also had time to ask their own questions, ranging from how to become a good diplomat to what role youth should play in Pakistan-U.S. relations. 
Zahra Chaudhary, a junior majoring in legal studies, had the chance to ask Khan a question about the change in the role of youth and later said she was glad to talk with an ambassador in person. 
“I like that he opened the floor to questions so that actual students could give their insight and feedback and ask him for advice because he’s been doing this for a long time,” Chaudhary said. 
Khan responded that with the influence of social media, many young people, both in the U.S. and Pakistan, are raising awareness and acting as global citizens in local and global policy. 
“You are different in the sense that you have responsibility not just for your own neighbor,  your own nation or province,” Khan said. “For instance, climate change, weapons of mass destruction, peace and security all around the world … are not local issues.” 
Abeerah Siddiqui, a junior majoring in environmental science and health and the president of PSA, said the discussion was an opportunity for students to hear from the ambassador’s perspective on his work amid rising tensions in Pakistan-U.S. relations over issues such as terrorism and nuclear weapons. 
“There was a lot of tension over the fact that there [were] terrorist groups present in Pakistan, and the U.S. thought that Pakistan was defending or helping them,” Siddiqui said. “So I think there’s a lack of proper communication between the two countries.” 
Khan followed to address the issue of terrorism in his country, praising the collaborative international partnerships to restore peace in the region. He stated that the longevity of Pakistan-U.S. relations contributed to restricting the influence of terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda.
“We have been steadfast partners this year. We have celebrated 75 years of our diplomatic ties, the journey that started with the exchange of messages between the White House and Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” Khan said. 
The session continued with a discussion on the economic interactions between the U.S. and Pakistan, with a highlight on the cooperation in the energy and agriculture sectors. Khan pointed out that new strides in agricultural research have been taking place in Pakistan due to the partnership between the two countries. 
“[Continuing to do] research in genomes, developing these weather resistant hybrid seeds … This is cutting edge, this is futuristic,” Khan said. “This has been in Pakistan because of the collaboration between Pakistan and the United States.” 
Despite many achievements, Pakistan also struggles with poverty — Khan said about 30% of the population is below the poverty line. He encouraged youth to make efforts to address this issue. 
“Elimination of poverty produces good business [investment] … You eliminate by empowering, and this is what is happening in Pakistan and there you can make a contribution,” Khan said. 
The 40-minute discussion ended with Khan encouraging younger generations to execute their plans of becoming community leaders and contributing to international development now. He also warned the students of the danger of procrastination, saying the future is always evasive. 
“Be ambitious. Make yourself the best leader in the world, the best super connector between nations,” Khan said.
