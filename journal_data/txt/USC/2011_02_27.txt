5:30  PM – And here we go again. The 83rd Academy Awards! Hosted by Anne  Hathaway and James Franco. Will the Weinsteins’ marketing campaign for The King’s Speech pay off? Will Annette Bening upstage the unstoppable Natalie Portman  for this year’s Best Actress award? Will the show directors frequently  cut to a laughing, sunglasses-clad Jack Nicholson in the front row? We  shall see.
5:36 – Anne Hathaway and James Franco are “inceptioned” in a particularly hammy montage of nominee clips.
5:37 – Morgan Freeman makes a cameo appearance in the montage as a dream narrator. I wish Morgan Freeman would narrate my dreams.
5:40 – Anne (in reference to her performance in Love and Other Drugs):  “You know, it used to be, You get naked, you get nominated. Not  anymore.” If only life were that simple. At least then, we might have a  more exciting awards show.
5:42  – Anne and James do their best with weak material, clearly aiming for  the teenage demographic. Anne soldiers on admirably, James looks like  he’d rather be in an opium den.
5:43 – Anne: “It’s been a great year for lesbians.” At a loss for words? Join the club.
5:46 – Alice in Wonderland wins Best Art Direction, ensuing much booming laughter from Tim Burton,  from the highest tower of his black castle (train your ears towards the  Burbank hills at 2 a.m. tonight.)
5:49 – Inception wins Best Cinematography. Fair enough.
5:53 – Kirk Douglas makes an appearance! Everyone (including this writer) swoons before the indispensable star of Paths of Glory and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,  but what begins as a tear inducing cameo segues into a painful ramble,  as Mr. Douglas struggles to present the Best Supporting Actress award.  Still, he has some fun with his appearance, sadistically prolonging the  award announcement for as long as possible. You can feel the audience  about to explode.
5:59 – Melissa Leo wins Best Supporting Actress for The Fighter, and gives a truly weird acceptance speech to match Douglas’s equally bizarre presentation.
6:03 – Justin Timberlake appears and declares himself Banksy. Don’t we all wish?
6:05 – The Lost Thing wins Best Animated Short.
6:09 – Toy Story 3 wins Best Animated Feature. SC alumnus and director Lee Unkrich gives a  warming acceptance speech, paying homage to animation cohorts, his  family and countless others. Leave it to a Pixar nominee to give the  most eloquent speech thus far.
6:16 – The Social Network wins Best Adapted Screenplay. Aaron Sorkin rises to expectations and  raises the acceptance speech bar higher, walking the line between cool  detachment and familial thanks smoothly. We should expect no less from  the writer of the year’s coolest film.
6:20 – The King’s Speech wins Best Original Screenplay. David Seidler gives a tender speech.
6:26  – Anne earnestly performs a truly dreadful piano ballad about being  stood up by Hugh Jackman for an Oscars dance. Who writes these numbers  anyway? I felt like Jackman’s fake retractable claws were stuck into my  brain.
6:27 – James trots out in drag, for no apparent reason, presumably to relieve Anne. He’d be great in a John Waters film.
6:29 – Another  awkward presentation, this one by Russell Brand and Helen Mirren, with  the latter speaking French and the former translating poorly. They say  the Oscars curse pertains to post-award film roles, but that sounds far  more endurable than having to present in one of these painfully scripted  sketches.
6:29 – In A Better World wins Best Foreign Language. Denmark – 1. American audiences – 0.
6:34 – Christian Bale wins Best Supporting Actor for his excellent turn in The Fighter and  delivers a charming, unpretentious, amusingly stream-of-consciousness  acceptance speech. He thanks his wife, daughter and also gives a  shout-out to the real Dicky Eklund, whose training services he  recommends to all those present. I can only hope this means sightings of  Gary Busey on the streets of Lowell this year.
6:45 – The Social Network gets Best Original Score. Imagine that. Trent Reznor at the Oscars!  Here’s a day I thought would never come. Well done, gentlemen!
6:49 – Inception wins Best Sound Mixing. Cool. That seems the like the best word to sum  up the crowd reaction. The speech is brief, but reminds us – In case you  didn’t know – that Chris Nolan made Inception.
6:51 – Inception gets Best Sound Editing too. Well deserved, but by now it’s clear that  Nolan has trained his crew to thank him “1000%” in the event of winning  an award. The level of brown nosing here is on par with Caligula.
6:55  – Marisa Tomei! Aww. Who doesn’t love Marisa Tomei? America’s most  endearing actress turns up to pay tribute to the Academy’s technical  award honorees.
6:56  – James Franco (paying his own tribute to the same nominees):  “Congratulations, nerds.” By far the funniest moment of the night.
6:59 – The Wolf Man wins Best Make Up. Really? Couldn’t they have gone for a more obvious choice like…
7:01 – …Alice in Wonderland, which just won Best Costume Design? Apparently, the Academy saw a different movie than the rest of the world’s population.
7:04  – A montage of interviewees describing their favorite Oscar-winning  song is presented, including a spot from the Commander in Chief himself.  What? Barack Obama watches movies?
7:08 – The nominated song from Tangled sounds suspiciously like “A Whole New World.” No one recycles hits like Disney.
7:15 – Strangers No More gets Best Documentary Short, as all of America runs to throw a new bag of popcorn in the microwave.
7:17 – God of Love snags Best Live Action Short. Director Luke Matheny, sporting a  thunderous afro, gives a sweet acceptance speech, thanking his mom for  providing the “craft services.”
7:20  – Another “comedic montage” – autotuning the nominees. In classic  fashion, the Academy is about two years late on this trend.
7:22  – Oprah Winfrey: “We go to the movies to escape.” In this day and age,  as revolution spreads through the Middle East and unions stand on the  brink of crippling erosion, I’m not sure if that insight is as uplifting  as Oprah meant it to be.
7:24 – Best Documentary Feature goes to Inside Job. A well deserved win. Director Charles Ferguson takes a page from  Michael Moore’s book and points out that not a single Wall Street  employee has been arrested in connection with the fraud that led to the  recession. Thankfully, he is not booed off of the stage.
7:28 – Billy Crystal is in the house! Wow, remember him? Perhaps he’s been flown in to rescue the show!
7:29  – Bob Hope is digitally resurrected to deliver the Best Visual Effects  award. Perhaps this gesture isn’t as immensely creepy in person as it is  on TV.
7:35 – Inception gets Best Visual Effects. Christopher Nolan is only acknowledged twice.
7:37 – The Social Network gets Best Editing. Thank god for it. The film was unmatched in cutting. Everyone seems quite satisfied with this win.
7:44  – James Franco, clearly stoned out of his mind – not that I blame him –  mentions the most “inappropriate movie titles of 2011,” including Winter’s Bone, Rabbit Hole and How to Train Your Dragon. Finally, someone who’s not taking this awards show seriously.
7:44 – Florence Welch turns up to sing “If I Rise” with AR Rahman, from 127 Hours.
7:46 – Gwenyth Paltrow sings the titular song from Country Strong. Did anyone actually see that movie?
7:47 – It’s a shame that Jonsi Birgisson wasn’t nominated for “Sticks and Stones” in How to Train Your Dragon. The awards show could have used the punch of joy that is that song.
7:48 – Randy Newman wins Best Original Song for Toy Story 3’s “We Belong Together.” Oh well. Consider it a rain check statuette for the first film’s “You’ve Got A Friend in Me”.
7:49 – Celine Dion serenades 2011’s departed names of Hollywood. You can’t help but envy them.
8:05 – David Fincher is robbed of a Best Director Oscar by the spring chicken Tom Hooper, winning the award for The King’s Speech. The Twitter universe experiences the equivalent of ten supernovas.
8:12 – James Franco is still visibly high.
8:18 – Natalie Portman wins Best Actress for Black Swan. Big surprise there. She also thanks everyone short of the film’s bottled water distributors for the award.
8:25 – Colin Firth wins Best Actor for The King’s Speech.  Another winner from right out of left field! Still, Mr. Firth gives a  gracious speech and best of all, thanks Tom Ford, director of 2009’s A Single Man, the film that Firth should have won the award for. Thus far, the Brits have the best speech record of the night.
8: 38 – The King’s Speech wins Best Picture. Yawn. So much for harnessing younger audiences. ABC can look forward to a swift plummet in ratings next year.
8:41  – In a cheap move to avert criticism of the show, the Academy ends the  spectacle with the children of Staten Island’s PS22 chorus, performing  “Over the Rainbow.” Somehow, as David Fincher, Javier Bardem and  Michelle Williams depart empty handed, the song seems gutted of its  wistful idealism.
I ENJOYED THE SHOW…..because I like the industry.   if some of you dissenters knew what it took to make a movie, maybe you would appreciate the fact that the academy has the class to honor them on prime time.   btw,  I found “stoned-out” Franco’s comment “Congrats Nerds” to be highly UN-professional and classless,
Lost loads of respect for Franco….  I found it touching and “cool” that the ‘nerds’ of the Industry who WON the Academy’s highest award in their respective profession were shown on screen in photographs from the earlier award ceremony.
Sure, we all want glitz & glamour….on TV, but remember this is an awards show….and like your graduation ceremony
NOT everyone is interested in your graduation or diploma….but you have an option NOT to show up  or not watch the ABC production…..
The “Instant Gratification” generation or society or mind set, that too many of us have, makes it difficult to appreciate anything that takes longer than a short email, you-tube video, 1 hour drama-soap, or sit-com……
It may be why many criticize political figures, but never watch a presidential debate. They get their views from SNL, Leno, Letterman, TMZ, Rush Limbasket, and Hannity’s Insanity…and even other liberal and conservative “entertainment”  shows, which are looking for ratings, NOT accuracy in presenting facts.  [see I not only like the awards show,  I LOVE POLITICAL COMMENTARY too].  
My fellow Trojans & others……Its an awards show people, not a Vegas Burlesque or Cirque du Soleil show……its the Movie Industry on TV.
Only 40+ million viewers in the usa……wow!!   how many people watched your fave show???
Fight ON!!!!
Love,
OSCAR
7:47 – It’s a shame that Jonsi Birgisson wasn’t nominated for “Sticks and Stones” in How to Train Your Dragon. The awards show could have used the punch of joy that is that song.
AGREED!  I’m just glad that song represented for 127 Hours didn’t win.  Not sure what was going on there..  :/

Yes, the Academy Awards are today, but let’s face it, some of the movies are pretty boring. Deeply meaningful, but boring. What America really likes to watch are the drunken and outrageous misadventures of four grown men, or The Hangover: Part II. The Wolf Pack has returned and the long- awaited first trailer is here.  
Although the trailer is just a teaser at only 1 minute and 16 seconds, it’s enough to show the results of a night of hard-core partying, which includes Zach Galifianakis with a shaved head, Ed Helms with a Mike Tyson tattoo and Bradley Cooper’s sexy swagger.
In the sequel to the top-grossing R-rated comedy The Hangover, the gang travels to Bangkok, Thailand for Stu’s (Helms) wedding.  And don’t worry, Stu isn’t marrying his crazy ex-girlfriend Melissa (Rachael Harris) or the prostitute named Jade (Heather Graham.)
In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cooper said, “Bangkok sort of tops Vegas in a huge way… [This one’s] a grand movie. This is the gritty, dirty reality of a city that’s populated by, I think, 7 million people, so it’s a lot different.”
The reunion comes to theaters May 26.

Do you ever hear much about drummers recording their own solo albums? Well, that’s exactly what Travis Barker of Blink-182 has done.
Barker’s solo album, Give the Drummer Some, is due to drop March 15. Give the Drummer Some has some huge names attached to it. Lupe Fiasco, Pharrell, Snoop Dogg, E-40, Busta Rhymes, Slash and The Cool Kids, are only some of the artists featured on the 16-track deluxe edition.
The first single, “Can a Drumer Get Some,” became available on iTunes on Feb. 1. Barker brought together Lil’ Wayne, Swizz Beatz, Game and Rick Ross for the simple, yet explosive track. With a very basic guitar riff, Barker’s drum beats keeps everything under wraps as it drives the rappers’ different verses, some referencing Michael Jackson and even Nicholas Cage.
The only words to the chorus are “Can a drummer get some,” but Swizz Beatz puts enough energy into it, and saves the phrase from becoming too overbearing.
In an MTV News interview, Barker described his new album as something that “helped him overcome the loss of his close friends and saved his life too.”
In 2008, he lost his friends “Lil” Chris Baker and Charles “Che” Still due to a plane crash and then his dear friend Adam “DJ AM” Goldstein in 2009.
Bearing the pain of his own injuries and the loss of his friends, working on his solo album allowed him to channel all the pain into an album that would mean something to him.
“Everyone on the album is someone I was blessed to come in contact at one point or another in my life,” he said to MTV. “That’s a pretty good way to describe how I feel about it too.”

The No. 6 USC women’s swimming and diving team took third place overall in the Pac-10 championships, finishing behind Stanford and California.
Strong performance · Over the weekend, junior Katinka Hosszu was named Pac-10 Swimmer of the Meet after posting first-place finishes in the 200 individual medley, 400 individual medley and 200-yard butterfly. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans took home eight titles from the competition, one off the school record for Pac-10 wins (nine wins in 2003).
“I am proud of the fact that we came away with eight individual championships, by far the most in nearly a decade,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “Those eight wins can turn into eight wins at the NCAA championships which attests to the perennial strength of the Pac-10 conference.”
USC started off on a positive note, ending the first day of the Pac-10s tied for second place with Stanford.
As the meet progressed, No. 4 Cal led the rankings during the opening competition, but by Saturday, No. 1 Stanford had managed to come back and take its second-straight Pac-10 title.
Though USC did not take home the Pac-10 title, it swept the individual titles.
Junior Katinka Hosszu was named Swimmer of the Meet, while junior Victoria Ishimatsu was named Diver of the Meet. Junior Harrison Jones, who participated in the men’s diving Pac-10 championships that also took place last week, was named men’s Diver of the Meet.
“I’m really happy with my times and placements,” Hosszu said. “I hope I can be faster at NCAAs and I’m excited to see how much faster I can go.”
Hosszu won three titles, the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medleys and the 200-yard butterfly, while sophomore Haley Anderson won two in the 500- and 1560-yard free.
Senior Lyndsay DePaul also finished strong for the team on Saturday, taking second place behind Hosszu in the 200-yard butterfly.
Although the Women of Troy stressed that the Pac-10s are not as important to the team as the NCAA competition coming up in two weeks, their third place finish was significant. To some, it is an indicator of what they can do better at NCAAs.
“It’s good we have this meet so we know what we need to improve in two weeks,” Hosszu said. “For example, I know I was slow on a couple of turns, so I can work on that. Hopefully we can improve and do much better at NCAAs.”
The NCAA competition will be March 17-19 in Austin, Texas. The team has high hopes for the last competition of its season.
“We had a strong showing at the Pac-10 conference championships and finished third to two very strong teams,” Salo said. “We are looking to move into the top 5 at NCAAs in a few weeks.”

Revenge tasted sweet as the USC men’s tennis team was determined, rain or shine, to bounce back and show No. 8 Stanford that it would not keel under pressure in a dominant 5-1 win Saturday.
Return to action  · Freshman Ray Sarmiento came back from injury on to help overtake the same Cardinal team that beat USC last weekend. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
The second of a double-header match went smoothly for the No. 9 Trojans, who were looking to regain their footing after a less-than-perfect ITA Indoor National Championships performance.
USC was slated to play California on Friday, but only made it through half of the singles matches before rain forced the teams to call it quits early.
The Trojans, who started with singles play in anticipation of the rain, looked shaky against the Golden Bears, but their match against Stanford that would prove to be more meaningful.
“From our entire team we were so prepared and confident, it was like we were a completely different team,” said junior Steve Johnson.
During USC’s abbreviated match against the Cardinal on Saturday, freshman Michael Grant was the only Trojan to lose, taking it to three sets against Stanford’s Matt Kandath 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Freshman Ray Sarmiento was back in the lineup, after missing the trip to Seattle and sitting out against Cal due with a wrist injury.
Johnson, as Sarmiento’s doubles partner, was happy to see him back in action.
“He’s a big part of our team,” Johnson said. “He’s a big talent and he gives a big lift to our team.”
Captains Johnson and senior Jaak Poldma, both given Pac-10 Players of the Week honors this season, continued their dominant play, winning against Bradley Klahn and Alex Clayton 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-1, respectively.
Johnson’s victory marks his second against Klahn this season.
The pair’s overall season record is 2-1.
Freshman Emilio Gomez came out strong against Stanford’s Greg Hirshman, winning 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.
Junior Daniel Nguyen struggled to seal the deal in two sets, but beat his opponent Ryan Thacher in a tiebreak 6-3, 7-6, 10-7. Nguyen played Tacher in the ITA Indoors last weekend but fell, 6-4, 6-4, in the Trojans’ 4-3 loss to the Cardinal.
“We got a big statement win,” Johnson said. “To come out and win 5-1, pretty handily? We bounced back.”
USC will host crosstown rival UCLA on Wednesday.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team defeated No. 6 Long Beach State 23-25, 25-20, 25-23, 23-25, 15-12 in a five-set thriller Friday evening at the Walter Pyramid in Long Beach, Calif.
It was the Trojans’ (10-1, 10-1) second five-set match of the season, and only the fourth time in 11 matches that they did not complete a sweep.
The Trojans exhibited their multi-head attack with four players recording double-digit kills. Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli led the charge with 17 kills and 13 digs. Senior outside hitter Tri Bourne had 13 kills, 12 digs and three blocks, senior middle blocker Austin Zahn finished with 14 kills and senior opposite Murphy Troy finished with 12 kills, five aces, 11 digs and two blocks.
The Trojans hit .315 for the match, well under their season average, while the 49ers (8-6, 7-4) hit .253. Senior setter Riley McKibbin finished with 60 assists to go along with nine digs.
Long Beach State commemorated their 1991 national championship team before the match, a team which defeated USC on its way to the NCAA title. Combined with a typically raucous crowd, the energy in the building would have derailed a less-veteran team.
“I don’t think the energy affected us,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “Their serving and our passing was really what affected us. They had an unbelievable game from the service line, like most teams have at home.”
The match featured a clash of titans from the service line; Troy finished with five aces and 49er senior opposite Jim Baughman finished with four.
Long Beach State finished with a total of eight service aces for the match and served the Trojans out of system for part of the match. They also finished with only 12 service errors.
“That’s an astonishing ratio,” Ferguson said. “Long Beach does a great job blocking when you’re out of system against them. They served us out of system and did a good job blocking us when we became predictable hitting the ball.”
The Trojans were able to pass better as the night went on and incorporate the two-headed middle blocker monster in Zahn and junior Steven Shandrick.
Zahn finished with 14 kills earned at a .524 clip and Shandrick finished with nine kills and five blocks while hitting .474.
“We really clicked when we settled down and passed the ball so we could run the middle,” Ferguson said. “When we were able to incorporate them, that was the difference in the match.”
Defensively, the Trojans were led by freshman libero Henry Cassiday’s 18 digs. Long Beach State All-American middle blocker Antwain Aguillard finished with only six kills.
“We did key on [Aguillard], but they helped us out a little bit,” Ferguson said. “[Senior setter] Riley [McKibbin] was blocking the outside hitter when Aguillard was up front, so they thought they should go after him. Riley’s not a bad blocker, so that hurt them.”
This strategy did not bode well for the Long Beach State outside hitters, who hit .255 and 1.52 for the match.
“They’re mostly a two-man band,” Ferguson said. “They needed their outsides to produce.”

The women’s basketball team completed a disappointing road trip on Saturday night, falling 84-74 to Arizona despite a double-double from junior guard Briana Gilbreath.
Versatile · In addition to posting a double-double, Briana Gilbreath, pictured here against Arizona State, had five blocks and four assists. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
The defeat followed a 69-55 loss to Arizona State on Thursday, and dropped the Women of Troy (16-11, 8-8) into a tie for fourth place in the Pac-10 with Arizona (17-10, 8-8). Both teams sit a game behind Arizona State (17-9, 9-7) in the conference standings.
Gilbreath was one of four USC players to score in double figures, posting a game-high 21 points and 10 rebounds. But the Wildcats outrebounded USC 31-18 in the second half as they pulled away late.
The game was a stark difference from the two teams’ matchup earlier in the season, when the Women of Troy took an early lead and claimed an 81-72 home victory.
“[The difference] was pure effort,” Gilbreath said. “Nothing else was different, no different play calls, no different defensive schemes … they wanted the game more than we did at the end of the day.”
The Wildcats took control of the game early, and held a 15-point deficit over USC with 4:44 remaining in the first half.
Led by Gilbreath, the Women of Troy staged a bit of a comeback in the last few minutes. USC’s leading scorer joined sophomore teammate Christina Marinacci in double figures, scoring the last shot of the half to make the halftime score 40-34 in favor of Arizona.
But the Wildcats came out of the locker room and dominated most of the second half, at one point leading 72-52.
“In the second half we didn’t come out strong, and they blew it out,” Gilbreath said. “We didn’t show up to play today, and when we did finally show up, it was too late.”
Once again, USC got its act together as the end of the half approached. The Women of Troy got their first back-to-back buckets of the second half when freshman Cassie Harberts scored and senior Jacki Gemelos followed suit after a defensive stop.
After a 7-0 run by the Women of Troy, junior Ashley Corral drained her 200th career three-pointer, extending her USC record, to cut Arizona’s lead to 74-67 with 1:30 to go.
But numerous fouls ended up hurting USC, as Corral and Gemelos fouled out as time ran out its comeback bid. The Wildcats wrapped up the game from the free-throw line, as they shot 29-of-38 from the charity stripe. Arizona’s leading scorer, Davellyn White, scored 15 of her 19 points from the free-throw line.
The team’s disappointment about the loss could be heard in Gilbreath’s voice, as she lamented the team’s lost chance to put itself in strong position for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
“This was our shot to push our way into the NCAA tournament,” Gilbreath said. “I think we still have a chance, but these were two big teams that we let slip out of our hands, and it was all on us.”
The Women of Troy return home for their final two regular season games, playing Washington State (8-20, 6-10) at 7 p.m. on Thursday and hosting Washington (11-14, 6-10) on Senior Day in a televised game on Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

In mid-June, USC coach Lane Kiffin will travel to Indianapolis to meet with the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions, faced with charges of a “failure to monitor,” as well a “failure to promote an atmosphere for compliance.”
The infamous white visor will be left in Los Angeles. The SoCal cool sunglasses will remain tucked away in the hotel room. And the swag will be kept in check.
A humbled Kiffin, if you can imagine it, will sit before a nine-member committee and attempt to prove his innocence during his 14-month tenure in Knoxville, Tenn.
A week ago, the Trojans’ second-year headman received a notice of allegations from the NCAA regarding various recruiting improprieties committed under his watch as the coach of the Volunteers, as outlined by a 26-page report issued by the University of Tennessee on Wednesday.
A troubling sign in the recent ordeal, however, is that Kiffin specifically, and not the UT football program as a whole, was cited by the NCAA, which given recent rulings by college athletics’ governing body is a puzzling occurrence.
When the COI slapped USC with the lack of institutional control label in June 2010, it found the football and men’s basketball programs responsible for the actions of certain individuals, namely Reggie Bush and then-running backs coach Todd McNair.
Traditionally, as demonstrated by the case involving Bush and basketball star O.J. Mayo, entire athletic departments have been held accountable for violations committed by its coaches and players.
But in the recent Tennessee case, all allegations have been directed toward Kiffin. As of right now, the university has avoided the NCAA’s wrath. And as usual, with controversial issues, the attention is planted squarely on the shoulders of Kiffin.
According to the recently released report, Kiffin’s citation stems directly from two separate instances: impermissible telephone contact with five recruits (a total of 16 calls spanning 47 minutes over a six-day period) and the inclusion of a recruiting intern, Steve Rubio, on a recruiting trip to Florida.
Allegedly, the extra phone calls made to recruits on behalf of Kiffin’s staff from Jan. 3 through Jan. 9, 2010, prompted Kiffin to receive a citation for a “failure to monitor.” The calls, however, were made on University of Tennessee phone lines, which the school oversees. Again, presuming recruiting violations were in fact committed, either the compliance department failed to properly monitor the program’s activities or the university chose not to self-report the violations.
Similarly, according to the report, Tennessee’s director of football operations David Blackburn informed Kiffin Oct. 10, 2009, that he was unable to bring Rubio along on a visit to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Kiffin, instead, disregarded the warning and brought Rubio along anyway. Yet, he faced no disciplinary action from the school. If Tennessee knew its coach was in direct violation of NCAA rules, but failed to report it, how then, would it not be cited along with Kiffin?
In either scenario, the failure by compliance to perform its due diligence or the football program to self-report the violations remains increasingly difficult to justify, begging the question of why Kiffin alone is being ousted.
Whether he actually committed violations is irrelevant. Instead, if there’s any takeaway from this recent case, it’s that it serves as yet another incident of the NCAA’s selective enforcement and inconsistency in its actions and decisions.
At USC, the entire athletic program was held accountable. During the Cam Newton fiasco at Auburn, everyone, seemingly, was let off the hook. And at Tennessee, most of the blame seems centered on Kiffin. All these incidents serve as incidents of failed oversight on behalf of the schools’ compliance staffs, but in each case, the party found responsible differs.
Granted, there has been no final outcome in this specific investigation, but the mere fact that Kiffin, not the larger institution, is being targeted, directly contrasts the NCAA’s four-year case hinging on whether USC was in fact guilty of a “lack of institutional control.”
When the COI released its findings, USC’s understaffed compliance department bore most of the responsibility for being unaware of the actions of particular players and coaches. In essence, it was penalized on the basis of not reporting, and therefore, not responding quickly enough when rules were broken.
In the case of Tennessee, however, Kiffin became its scapegoat, and based on various events that have occurred in the Volunteer State over the past year, it wouldn’t be the first time.
Past precedent indicates that the NCAA’s report won’t impact the Vols’ recruiting practices significantly, for there will only be a loss of some recruiting visits and maybe a limitation on who is allowed to travel during certain recruiting periods.
As demonstrated by previous rulings, though, Kiffin, despite now serving as the USC coach, could be barred from off-campus recruiting altogether, anywhere from a couple months to a year, as was the case with Rick Neuheisel following his tenure at the University of Colorado from 1995 to 1998.
Despite being a Tennessee employee, Kiffin’s reprimanding from the NCAA won’t mirror that of UT. His recruiting practices have been more heavily scrutinized and the punishment levied will be more significant.
The witch hunt has already begun.

I know this is a USC article, but you do know the school is also going to the infractions board too? 
Take away the school and the coach – this is exactly what any school would do when a coach leaves you in the dust.  Normally when this happens the compliance department takes the blame, but since Kiffin left UT in such a bad way obviously they rolled on him.  I’m sure there’s 100 emails that could be pulled up in any compliance department today showing violations by a coach, but those never see the light of day because it serves no gain to the school.   Kiffin earned this one.
I bet lane kiffin goes to prison within the year. And the we’ll get a real coach.
Iras fascinating USC has such an ego, but are so weak. Troy is falling. You just don’t have the power you think you do. 
Go Gators!
lol!!! now Sanchez and Malauga have been arrested for rape charges..hahahahahahahaaa. gotta love it when those fearful and jealous of USC make up stuff. Also have to love that McKnight “girl friend” take. I guess the fact that she was carrying his baby wasnt enough to establish a perm relationship between them. Jeff is a such a loser. Also have to love how loser haters like Jeff stalk USC and its media…hahahahahahahahahaahhahaahahahahahah. Hey, isnt staking illegal? $10 Jeff is stalking like 4 women as we speak….hahahahahahahahaahahah!!!
injustice? REALLY, Mark Sanchez arrested for sexual assualt, rey malaluga assault and sexual assault, winston justice posession of a firearm and solicitaion of a prostitute, shareece wright felony resisting and still starts on saturday, fili moala aressted after a bar fight, eric wright aressted on suspicion of rape while in posession of 136 extacy pills, joe mcknight with his “girlfriends” suv, extra coaches on the sideline,  dont get me started on reggie and his new house, cars, plane tickets, or the basketball program, or the whopping 54% graduation rate  haha, and you call this in justice. or would you like more examples of what defines lack of institutional control. If there is any injustice it is actually to reggie since they banned him from campus and not pete the cheat. Kiffin was present during all of theis and continued it elsewhere. SERVE IT UP.
This has b-ruin written all over it
haters gonna hate
Really? If arrests (that don’t even take place during their time at college) means that the school is responsible for lack of institutional control…then shouldn’t Florida receive the death penalty? Yeah, the ONLY thing on there that’s reasonable is Reggie and the school was not involved. Joe McKnight’s “girlfriend” was pregnant with his baby, so I guess she doesn’t exist. Pete did not pay Reggie but Reggie received money. Reggie’s actions were the wrongdoings and Pete played a player who was not known to be ineligible at the time.
What a joke. NCAA is exposing themselves as the political organization they are. But what they do not understand is this is making SC stronger, They are just adding to Trojan lore and mystic and the kids want to play for that,  just look at the last recruiting class.  This is a opportunity to fight against injustice. And this will in the end motivate every TROJAN to give it all. Fight On !
dirt bags always get what they deserve
Let me guess. Another jilted vols fan.
Jeff, how is your useless degree treating you?

USC walked into its weekend series at No. 22 Rice with a 3-1 overall mark, and at times, looked capable of improving upon their strong start.
In three games, the Trojans committed just two errors and yielded one unearned run.
And although Rice scored 19 runs in the three games, seven of those came in one inning.
Quality start · Junior starter Austin Wood finished with a no decision Saturday despite allowing just three runs in six and two-third innings. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
But the Trojans leave Houston with three straight losses. The problem: timely hitting. The Trojans left 32 men on base over the span of three games, bringing their season total up to 68 for the season — nearly 10 per game.
Sunday, the Trojans left eight men on, including the tying run in the ninth to take a 3-2 loss.
The key moment for Rice came in the seventh inning. With the score tied at one and USC senior starting pitcher Logan Odom still going strong, Rice shortstop Derek Hamilton was hit by a pitch and then stole second. A base hit put runners at the corners, and another steal put men on second and third with two down.
It was Rice’s chance to demonstrate some timely hitting, and they did. First basemen J.T. Chargois ripped a triple to right to give the Owls and 3-1 lead and chase Odom from the game.
But USC would have its chances. With one out in the eighth, sophomore third basemen Adam Landecker singled and junior first basemen Ricky Oropesa reached on an error to put two on. Senior second baseman Joe De Pinto singled to left to plate Landecker and move Oropesa to second, but neither junior right fielder Alex Sherrod nor junior catcher Kevin Roundtree could get the hit that was needed.
Junior designated hitter Brandon Garcia led off the ninth with a single right back up the middle. Freshman catcher Kevin Swick was brought on as a pinch-runner and advanced to second on a fielder’s choice to put the tying run in scoring position with one out, but Rice’s closer fanned a pair to end the game, completing the sweep for the Owls.
Saturday ended in a similarly crushing way for the Trojans. All told, the Trojans left 13 men on base Saturday, leaving the bases juiced in the first, sixth and ninth, a standing a pair in the eighth.
Junior starting pitcher Austin Wood matched Odom’s stellar Sunday performance with three runs over six and two-thirds innings Saturday, but the Trojans’ bullpen was unable to maintain the lead.
Saturday and Sunday could be classified as pitchers’ duels, but Friday was a slugfest.
The Trojans struck in the top of the first with a simple sacrifice fly, but then stranded runners at the corners. They put another across in the fourth, but then left the bases loaded. USC put a third run on the board in the top of the fifth, but in the bottom half of the inning it all fell apart.
Rice tied the game with no outs, and scored once more with one out. With two down, the Trojans looked to get out of the inning down just one, but surrendered a two-run homer and another two-out RBI before finally getting out of the inning with a seven on the board.
The Trojans chipped away with two in the sixth. Sherrod led off the seventh with USC’s first homer of the season to make it a one-run game. USC then proceeded to tie the game on a passed ball.
The Trojans used four pitchers in the seventh inning in an attempt to keep the Owls off the board, but freshman Derek Hamilton ripped an RBI single through the hole to give Rice an 8-7 lead. The Trojans stranded another pair in the eighth, and Rice tacked on two more for a 10-7 lead before USC went quietly in the ninth.
Up next for USC is a Tuesday game at Long Beach State at 6:30 p.m.

Throughout USC’s 62-46 rout of Arizona State on Saturday night the Galen Center crowd could be heard chanting in unison, “One more year. One more year.”
Consistency · In what might have been his final game at Galen Center, junior forward Nikola Vucevic finished with his 18th double-double of the season with 20 points, 10 rebounds. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
From the pre-game ceremony to the final whistle, Saturday’s festivities were intended to honor the team’s graduating seniors — forward James Dunleavy, forward Marcus Simmons, guard Donte Smith and center Alex Stepheson — during their final home game, but the cheers coming from the Trojan student section were aimed at someone else: junior forward Nikola Vucevic.
Vucevic, who could potentially forgo his senior season in hopes of being selected in June’s NBA Draft, responded in a big way on what could have been his final game at Galen Center.
Paced by the Montenegro-native’s three-point baskets and hook shots, the Trojans (17-12, 9-7) easily beat the last place Sun Devils, never trailing after an early 5-3 deficit.
“It’s always nice to hear that,” Vucevic, who recorded his 18th double-double of the season with 20 points and 10 rebounds, said of the chants. “It shows people care. But I haven’t thought about it yet, and will discuss the decision after the season with my family and coach O’Neill.”
Though the junior stole the spotlight on Senior Night, the seniors also had a big role in the team’s fourth straight victory.
Stepheson had a dunk-filled double-double (15 points and 10 rebounds) while limiting Arizona State forward Kyle Cain to a very quiet two points in 17 minutes of play.
Smith, took awhile to get going, connected on 3-of-12 from behind the three-point arc, pitching in with 12 points.
And true to the M.O. he has built over the last four years in a USC uniform, Simmons proved how vital he can be to the team’s success without even touching the ball.
Despite only taking one shot, Simmons held senior guard Ty Abbott, the Sun Devils’ second- leading scorer (12.6 points per game) to just one point on 0-of-7 shooting from the field. In addition, he led USC in assists with five that night.
“They [the seniors] have done an unbelievable job of keeping a great attitude for what has been a tough two years,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “And if Marcus Simmons isn’t the defensive player of the year in the conference, I don’t know who is.”
The Trojans took control of the game in the first half with what has brought them success all year: half-court defense.
After Vucevic put USC on top 8-7 with 16 minutes remaining in the first half, the Trojans gave up four points over the next 10 minutes.
Feeding off its defensive intensity, USC’s offense went on a 23-7 run to close the half, while surrendering a season-low 18 points on 28.6 percent shooting by the Sun Devils (10-18, 2-14).
In the second half, the Sun Devils missed their first six attempts from the field and USC capitalized, building its lead to a game-high 26 points, as it led 51-25 with 10 minutes remaining.
USC will look to continue its four-game win streak when it concludes the Pac-10 regular season with a trip up north to the Washington schools next weekend.
“As a team we are hitting our peak, we are playing lock down defense and playing great offense,” Smith said. “We are not thinking about the NIT, we are thinking about the NCAA tournament.”
First up for the Trojans will be Thursday night’s 7 p.m. tilt against Washington State (17-10, 7-8) at the Wallis Beasley Coliseum in Pullman, Wash.
The Cougars are led by senior guard and Pac-10 Player of the Year candidate, Klay Thompson (21.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and four assists per game).
USC won the teams’ first contest this season back on Dec. 31, narrowly defeating the Cougars 60-56.
“Those are two must wins for us,” Stepheson said. “It won’t be an easy trip, but we can get it done.”
The Trojans, who currently find themselves alone in fourth place in the conference standings, will then return to Los Angeles  March 9 to take part in the Pac-10 Tournament at the Staples Center.

Though USC students have access to a variety of on-campus restaurants and eateries, CampusCred, a new online business for college dining, shopping and events, offers students significant discounts at local restaurants and food stores to encourage off-campus exploration.
Discounts · Students who sign up for CampusCred will receive a $10 voucher at Chick-fil-A on Figueroa Street for a $5 online payment. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan
Undergraduates at the University of California, Berkeley developed CampusCred, which is similar to Groupon, in August of 2010. The company is completely student-run and has expanded to other UC schools including UCLA. It is now debuting at USC by offering students a $10 voucher at the new Chick-fil-A on Figueroa Street for only a $5 online payment.
“CampusCred is by students, for students. Our deals are exclusively offered to students and are at least 50 percent off,” said Sagar Shah, the company’s founder. “Businesses like it because we are guaranteeing them customers, and students love it because they’re able to enjoy restaurants in their college community for less.”
More than 400 USC students have already embraced CampusCred by taking advantage of the Chick-fil-A deal, according to the website’s customer count.
Andrew Hornblower, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said although he would still dine at Chick-fil-A without the discount, he plans to take advantage of future CampusCred deals, especially the ones at pricey venues.
“This will be a great way to try out expensive places and although Chick-fil-A is obviously not one of them, I am very excited to explore what the community has to offer,” Hornblower said.
Wing Lee, a member of the CampusCred team at USC, said CampusCred plans to offer students discounts not only at relatively cheap eateries like Chick-fil-A, but also at higher-end establishments like L.A. Live restaurants.
“A lot of times, students are hesitant to leave campus and try new places because they aren’t familiar with it, but CampusCred is trying to change that,” Lee said.
CampusCred counters this possible dilemma by awarding students a $5 credit for each friend they sign up online.
“It’s about spreading the word and encouraging students to go to these places with their friends so they have a good time,” Lee said.
With these social goals in mind, CampusCred launched a Facebook page that gives students additional discounts if they “like” the page, according to Nick La Maina, another member of the USC CampusCred team.
“Social networking is a big part of CampusCred,” La Maina said. “Facebook allows students to connect online and share their experiences at Chick-fil-A and other restaurants.”
CampusCred’s off-campus deals might convince some students to choose off-campus venues over residence dining.
“These discounts allow me and all my friends to save money and hang out at Chick-fil-A and other venues in the future,” said Devon Graves, a junior majoring in philosophy.
Some students are excited about the discounts because meals will be cheaper than in the dining halls.
“Parkside is expensive compared to Chick-fil-A, especially with these discounts,” said Skylar Shapiro, a sophomore majoring in history.
As CampusCred’s presence grows on campus, the company plans to give students discounts at non-food related businesses. La Maina said students can expect to see CampusCred discounts for bowling, movies and even haircuts in the future.
“Our goal is to not just encourage students to discover places to eat in the community,” La Maina said. “We want students to explore more options for entertainment and recreation and make the most of their off-campus college experience.”

Republican lawmakers have proposed a series of budget cuts that would slash financial aid for college students.
One of the major proposed budget cuts involves a reduction in funding for the Federal Pell Grant Program. The program supplies need-based grants to undergraduates and some postbaccalaureate students with low-income to encourage access to postsecondary education.
Nearly eight million Pell Grant recipients would notice a 15 percent reduction in scholarship funds. The maximum Pell Grant would also be reduced by $845 from $5,550 to $4,705.
In a recent news statement, Congressman Hal Rogers (R-KY), chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, declared such cuts necessary and a reflection of the demand of the voters in the 2010 midterm election.
The proposed Republican budget-cuts are estimated at $61 billion.
“This year, our nation is spending 1.5 trillion dollars more than we have, running our debt to $14 trillion,” Rogers said. “The taxpayers have told us loud and clear that this is simply unacceptable, and have demanded that we get our nation’s fiscal house in order.”
According to Thomas McWhorter, executive director of Financial Aid at USC, approximately 3,700 undergraduate students at USC currently receive Pell Grants.
Although the Office of Financial Aid believes cuts in Pell Grant funding are unlikely given the current political situation, it is still closely watching the unfolding political events.
“We’re monitoring the situation closely, but it seems unlikely that the President and senate will pass [cuts in Pell Grant funding],” McWhorter said. “It’s a difficult budget situation regardless.”
According to McWhorter, an increase in federal funding through the Pell Grant program, allows the university to expand its financial aid resources.
“We can give more money to more people when we have more federal funds,” McWhorter said. “[Federal funds] help stretch what we have further.”
McWhorter explained that the proposed cuts in Pell Grant funding would not fundamentally change the school’s financial aid policy.
“A small decrease of $3 or $4 million in financial aid, when we’re paying $120 million in need-based grants each year, is a significant cut, but it won’t drastically alter our policy,” McWhorter said.
The university maintains it will continue to meet the financial needs of students through grants, work-study programs and loans.

The rate of strokes among young adults has increased significantly in recent years, according to a study by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and some experts say the increase could be caused by the unhealthy lifestyles led by many college students.
The CDC study, which used hospital records in 41 different states, found that in recent years, strokes have increased by roughly 51 percent in men and 17 percent in women between the ages of 15 and 34.
Studies have not formally explored why the rate of stroke hospitalization has increased, but Henry Huang, director of the lipid clinic and assistant professor of clinical medicine in the department of cardiology at USC’s University Hospital, said the increased rate might be the result of unhealthy habits.
“It could be that what’s driving this increase are increased rates of obesity and related lifestyle factors like smoking, drugs and heavy alcohol use,” Huang said.
Signs of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, difficulty with speaking or understanding, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, dizziness and an intense headache with no known cause, according to the American Stroke Association.
The study found that stroke rates are decreasing among older age groups, but did not offer any reasons as to why the findings show increased risks among younger age groups and decreased risk in older age groups.
“For a stroke to happen in a young, college-aged person is something that is uncommon, but it is not unheard of,” Huang said.
Lawrence Neinstein, executive director of the University Park Health Center, said USC sees a very small number of students with strokes.
“We have not noticed an increase in recent years,” Neinstein wrote in an e-mail. “The Times article that referenced this was also referring a lot to young adults in their 30s and 40s, which is more reflective of our graduate population or older graduate population, not the majority of our student body.”
Amytis Towfighi, a chair and assistant professor in the department of neurology, said she also believes the obesity epidemic is contributing to the increase in the number of young adult stroke hospitalizations.
“In fact, currently, two-thirds of the U.S. population is overweight/obese, and rates of obesity among children have increased,” Towfighi wrote in an e-mail.
Some students, however, say the demands of college life preclude a healthy lifestyle.
“College students especially sleep much less,” said Mallika Gunupati, a sophomore majoring in architectural studies. “Whenever I get the chance, I eat. Whenever I get the chance, I sleep.”
Other students, however, make sure to engage in healthy behaviors to decrease their risk of poor health effects.
“I make an effort to eat healthy and exercise regularly because it’s good for your health physically and mentally,” said Mason Khoo, a freshman majoring in kinesiology. “A lot of people these days just eat a lot of junk food and sit around without getting any exercise.”
An unhealthy lifestyle, however, might not be the only reason for the increased rate of strokes.
“It may also be possible that the data’s showing increased rates of stroke in younger people because over the last decade or so there has been more awareness, increased rates of diagnosis and better imaging technologies,” Huang said.
Students should educate themselves so they will be able to recognize the signs, Towfighi said.
Candice Navi, an undeclared freshman, said she finds the study results to be scary, but not shocking.
“It’s really concerning, but in a lot of ways unsurprising because people our age are expected to do more earlier and there’s a lot of stress in that,” Navi said.

“Brother or bitch.”
That’s the ultimatum given to Adam Buckley (Trevor Morgan), a fraternity pledge and the protagonist of Will Canon’s cleverly titled film. We first meet Adam in the back of a moving van, en route to a convenience store that he will have to rob at gunpoint to be initiated into the upper ranks of Sigma Zeta Chi.
Bloodied bro · Kevin (Lou Taylor Pucci), from Canon’s new film Brotherhood, solely kvetches throughout the entirety of the picture. - Photo courtesy of Phase 4 Films 
This is what Descartes and Emerson would call a terrible idea.
Unsurprisingly, despite the older brothers’ attempts to mastermind the hazing ritual, another pledge, Kevin (Lou Taylor Pucci) is shot by an equally young and confused convenience store clerk, Mike (Arlen Escarpeta). The brothers, led by the perpetually flustered Frank (Jon Foster) must then save their wounded man without going to a hospital, while keeping the clerk quiet.
Things get worse at every turn, almost comically so. For example, after much shouting and deliberation, a tight-lipped doctor is finally summoned to the house to examine Kevin’s wound. Meanwhile, an army of sorority sisters descends upon the house, admonishing the brothers for a recent panty raid. As the very drunk leader eventually backs her SUV into the road, another car smashes into it, sending glass everywhere. Guess who’s driving the other car?
Brotherhood at least canvasses a relatable subject. Fraternities, resurrected to glory by Animal House, are around us everywhere, from 28th Street to Wall Street. To the outsider, they inspire both idealism and contempt. Some envy the deep bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood, even when the kinship becomes an isolationist mentality, ultimately making the world a more segregated place.
It comes as little surprise, then, that Brotherhood is most successful when illustrating that insulation from the fabric of the real world. The post-shooting “negotiation” between Adam, Mike and an blatantly racist brother (Luke Sexton) is wonderfully perverse in its reversal of common etiquette. Suddenly, the shooting becomes Mike’s fault, as the brothers hammer him to hand over the security tape, sounding more like loan sharks than soon-to-be defendants.
Even before the brothers get back to the house, we are given another glimpse into this island mentality. Another pledge seduces and has noisy sex with an obese girl, only to have his fellow brothers burst in and ridicule the guy’s poor partner, roaring like patrons of a rodeo show. The scene is shockingly effective in its depiction of latent misogyny and sadism that pass for standard discourse in this strange, machismo-fueled world.
These are despicable characters, so much so that the film could only work as a moving portrait, akin to I Stand Alone. As Gaspar Noe probed the “bowels of France” through his depraved butcher, Canon’s film offers a similarly proctologic examination of inner America and its privileged inhabitants who contribute nothing to their environment but further pain and narcissism.
Unfortunately, Canon doesn’t seem to realize this, eventually ousting Adam as the film’s moral beacon, while also drawing heavily from the Reservoir Dogs playbook.
As a whole, the film is a loud, ugly affair with much screaming and little reflection. There’s even a Mexican standoff. This absurdity might have worked had Canon realized the lack of redemptive qualities in his leads, but the film still simpers for our empathy and ultimately insults our intelligence.
There have been successful cases in which loathsome souls are rendered endearing, as with Darren Aronofsky’s self-centered heroin junkies in Requiem for a Dream. As we watched them slide into pits of vomit and despondency, the realization emerged that these were human beings, nailed to their own crosses of syringes, amphetamines and greenbacks.
It’s hard to feel that realization in Brotherhood, not even during Adam’s moments of epiphany. That we never see the brothers in their pre-frat lives adds to the problem. We can’t be expected to identify with these guys if none of the sacrifices they have made to rush are explored.
Presumably Adam and Frank have friends, colleagues and family members beyond the doors of Sigma Zeta Chi, but they are nowhere to be seen.
The real problem is that the classist undercurrents of fraternities were already adequately plucked in Charles Ferguson’s recent documentary Inside Job. Standing beside the grandiose high rises of New York’s financial district and the equally towering arrogance of its traders, Canon’s characters are not only short on complexity, but on purpose as well.

Can exercising outside really improve your mental well being?
According to a recent study, the answer is yes.
But before you throw on a pair of sneakers and sunglasses, take a moment to reconsider this hypothesis.
On Feb. 3, Environmental Science and Technology published a study that analyzed how people felt after exercising both indoors and outdoors. Those exercising outdoors reported increased feelings of happiness and fewer feelings of anxiety or depression. The study ultimately concluded that there are immense mental and psychological benefits to exercising outdoors.
But this final statement is tenuous. Although the study provides a significant amount of evidence, it fails to acknowledge a number of factors that might hinder people from feeling as euphoric as the participants in the study did.
Let’s begin with the joys of nature. Indeed, nature has its scenic qualities, but it can also be downright irritating.
The outdoors flaunt some of the most hair-pulling-worthy terrain for the average jogger. It doesn’t matter how much you admire the natural world. Eventually, the countless spider webs, mosquitoes and hidden tree roots will find you.
Weather is another issue. During winter, most places see spikes in colder temperatures, which make it nearly impossible to enjoy an outdoor escapade.
Even summertime has its threats in the form of sunburns and heatstrokes.
If you’re like most people and aren’t constantly lathering on sunscreen, staying outside for an hour or two isn’t exactly the best way to care for yourself.
Even if the weather is perfect and the paths are clear, pedestrians and cars are two of the most frustrating challenges that can easily upset your mood.
To successfully complete a workout, you need to cross streets, avoid crowded routes and, above all, remain alert. If you’re a runner, be prepared for inconvenient stops and turns on crosswalks and narrow paths. If you’re a biker, be wary of passing cars and constrictive bike lanes.
When you opt for the outdoors, you’re also involuntarily agreeing to take almost nothing with you. To the gym, you can bring spare clothes, a water bottle, a cell phone and an iPod. But try comfortably carrying all of your necessities on a three-mile jog outside — you’re in for disappointment.
Although the study overlooks fairly common elements that can negatively affect your attitude for the worse, it still holds some merit in stressing the importance of changing up routine.
One of the major effects exercising outside had on the study’s participants was that it made them more excited for future outings. Though further studies should be conducted to determine the reliability of this connection, it is possible exercising outdoors might be a valuable tool in encouraging routine fitness.
Another reason the study’s findings were so positive is because it relied heavily on social interaction. It’s nearly impossible to talk to a friend and run on a treadmill at the same time, but being outside offers easier communication and fewer immediate distractions.
Outdoor exercise also lets you break away from that competitive feeling, which is so prominent in gym atmospheres. Not everybody should feel compelled to compare heart rates and dumbbell weights.
Finally, moving outdoors can encourage you to break away from technology. Sure, most of us still don an iPod and ear buds, even when heading outdoors, but at least you’re not glued to the TV or the flashy red lights on an elliptical station.
For now, don’t rely on a single study to tell you which environment is best for you. The best option is to simply incorporate a combination of both outdoor and indoor exercise. If you stick to the gym or that overused treadmill in your apartment, you’re bound to feel bored and claustrophobic.
But if you rely on the same route outside, what happens when the weather takes a turn for the worse?
Being able to adapt to either environment is the best way to stay healthy, both physically and mentally.

Acclaimed jazz-bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding, who was freshly thrust into the spotlight by her Grammy victory for Best New Artist, visited Bovard on Saturday.   
She was backed by an ensemble that included pianist Leo Genovese and drummer Terry Lynne Carrington, both of whom played on her album Chamber Music Society.
The show started with a dark stage, but Spalding’s silhouette was unmistakable as she walked out to the small setup on the left wing.
She sat silently in a wingback chair, looking as though she was making herself at home, until she eventually walked to the middle of the stage.
Propping her bass against her body, Spalding started into “Little Fly,” the poem by William Blake that she set to music.
The backup string instruments were mostly light and airy, which complemented Spalding’s sweet voice, but the music was layered with drums, piano and largely characterized by the deeper, complex notes of her bass.
The songs ranged from soothing and simple to riveting, to danceable, and although most of the set sounded unique, Spalding occasionally transitioned into a more recognizable contemporary jazz tempo.
When it came to vocals, she seemed much more concerned with using the voice as an instrument itself, focusing on pitches and sounds, as opposed to lyrics.
Partway into the concert, Spalding played “Wild is the Wind,” one of her more recognizable songs where the heavy instrumental focus and occasionally sharp piano notes contrast well with her gentle, seraphic voice.
Spalding appeared to be completely at home on the stage. She performed barefoot, occasionally dancing along to the music. At one point, she hummed into her water glass, as if she and the ensemble were alone.
By today’s conventional expectations for concerts, her approach might be called minimalist, but Spalding was not concerned with putting on a flashy show.
She was entirely focused on the music. There were no overenthusiastic antics.
There wasn’t even any banter between songs, which was refreshing for this kind of performance. Spalding drew in the audience with her distinct presence and organic, quiet passion.
The entire performance contained a captivating  “je ne sais quoi” that might have simply come from watching a talented performer so clearly in love with her music.
The concert was accentuated by numerous bass solos, which seemed to come naturally to Spalding as she became enveloped in them.
Keeping with the low-key mood of the performance, the show passed over any grand, bombastic ending.
Spalding returned to the wingback chair, had another sip of her drink and put her jacket back on, before concluding with a final song.
The audience received Spalding enthusiastically, punctuating the performance with smatterings of applause and giving her a standing ovation at the end.
Spalding was a joy to watch and she proved that the uproar over her Grammy win was unwarranted.
She is a unique, talented artist — a welcome breath of fresh air.
If her performance at Bovard was any indication, Spalding clearly has something to offer, not just to the jazz world, but to the entire music world.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Spalding’s album was called Music Chamber Society, the album it titled Chamber Music Society.
Tough to get into.  Beautiful voice but music was more like ella fiztgerald meets bella lewitzky without the cole porter interludes.  Loved her fro.  Kind of reminded me of one of those dabbers that my mom used for church bingo.
GREAT ARTICLE. GREAT ARTIST.  BRAVA SPAULDING!!!

The NFL Scouting Combine is under way, and while much of the discussion has been directed toward standout quarterbacks, specifically Auburn’s Cam Newton and Missouri’s Blaine Gabbert, one former Trojan attracted some serious attention.
According to Adam Caplan of FOXSports.com, former USC tight end Jordan Cameron had the fifth-best performance on Saturday, the first day of workouts at this year’s combine in Indianapolis.
Jordan boasted an impressive time of 4.59 seconds in the 40-yard-dash, which was the second best time among tight ends. His three-cone time of 6.82 seconds ranked higher than anyone else at his position.
Caplan went on to praise Cameron for his notable size, (6’ 5 1/8’’ and 254 pounds) but added that it may take him a while to adjust in the NFL given his minimal experience at the tight end position.
Cameron’s only year as a tight end was last year. Prior to that, he served as a wide receiver. In 12 games during the 2010 season, he recorded 126 receiving yards, including one touchdown and six rushing yards.
Eight USC players were selected to participate in the combine. Besides Cameron, the other players included running back Allen Bradford, defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, defensive back Shareece Wright, offensive tackle Tyron Smith, center Kristofer O’Dowd, wide receiver Ronald Johnson, and fullback Stanley Havili.
The NFL combine runs through March 1.

Possibly one of the most beloved community service programs on campus, the Joint Educational Program is a service-learning program that more than 2,000 USC students participate in annually.
Students can become Project Read and Math mentors, work in shelters, or work with foster care children.

The most popular division is teaching, where  students can participate as teacher assistants or in groups to teach mini-courses.
Unfortunately, JEP’s popularity can probably be attributed to the extra credit handed out to students who teach.
A student enrolled in an anthropology class might get his lowest two quiz scores dropped. A French IV class offers the option to participate in JEP instead of taking a final exam.
And a JEP course probably never filled up as quickly as when CHEM 105bL, second-semester general chemistry, tacked on three percent to the final grade as an incentive. Within the span of five to or six hours, every single spot was filled, according to the JEP coordinator for the class.
But do the ends justify the means?
Many students would probably not participate in JEP were it not for the strong allure of extra credit points.
Admittedly, I signed up for JEP this semester in hopes of buffering my chemistry grade, and I can reasonably assume a good number of students only filled out the application forms for the same reason.
In fact, only 400 students, a measly 20 percent, volunteer without academic compensation, according to the JEP website.
Does offering extra credit pose a “necessary evil,” for the good of community outreach?
After all, JEP is a significant time commitment. And as participants, we deserve some measure of compensation for the many hours spent planning, preparing, teaching and writing reflection responses.
Ideally, we would require no reward for community service and would participate in the spirit of charity and for the sake of personal growth.
Practically, however, JEP requires a large number of students to function. Offering extra credit is a free, uncomplicated form of motivation.
But although JEP is a great way to reach out to the community,  and offering extra credit might dramatically increase the popularity of the program,  this isn’t necessarily a fair trade-off.
Giving extra credit might appear to be a win-win situation, but it means grades are used merely as leveraging points for philanthropy.
Grades should be a reasonably accurate determination of what we have learned in a class.
It is unlikely teaching K-12 students will actually reinforce knowledge of the subject taught in the class.
Especially for students placed in younger elementary school classrooms, the material covered will be far too basic to provide any meaningful reinforcement of the subject matter in their complementary USC course.
For example, I teach fifth graders general chemistry. Last week we went over the three states of matter. Clearly this cannot be expected to help me in reviewing for my next chemistry midterm.
Why should teaching them what a proton is qualify me for a grade boost in a course like CHEM 105bL?
Currently, it is up to individual professors to decide how to allocate credit for JEP participation. This method allows for more flexibility on the professors’ part but overestimates the validity of this form of academic compensation.
Possible alternative methods of compensation could be in the form of one elective unit per semester or recommendation letters — more reasonably correlated with what we are doing in the classroom.
What we learn in JEP is not the subject we’re teaching, but rather how to teach and interact with kids.
We take more personal gains and reflections about citizenship, community service and possible career paths from the experience than subject matter. That in and of itself is valuable enough to merit our time and effort.
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health and biological sciences. Her column, “Trojan Grounds,” runs Mondays.
As a coordinator for the work-study program Readers Plus through JEP, I have another view. I believe it is a shame that some students exclusively do JEP for credit. But I also know many search out JEP in their classes and gain real appreciation.
And at the end of the day, it sounds bad, but at least some help and extra learning is being provided to these students.
sorry dudes, i did it just for the chicks

Starting today, Campus Cruiser will start its service one hour later, opening its free campus transportation at 6 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. Although the campus-wide e-mail that was sent last week promises “focusing resources on high-demand periods,” there is no articulation how specifically this is going to happen.
Students deserve to know why certain changes are taking place, as well as what Campus Cruiser is doing to implement those changes.
But with no specifics on decreasing hold times or increasing the number of cars during high volume nights, it is impossible for students to know if the recently announced change will benefit them.
It’s not hard to find people who have had problems with Cruiser’s service. Students routinely complain about not being able to reach an operator, having to wait 30 minutes or more for a car, or sometimes not getting picked up at all.
The recent change to Cruiser’s operating hours seems like it could be an attempt to address some of these issues, at least during peak hours. But why can’t Cruiser tell us specifically what changes they are making?
In general, Cruiser’s policy could benefit from more transparency.
For instance, many students don’t know the automated text or phone call we receive about a cruiser being outside is not a system of communication from the cruiser car to your cellphone. It’s an automated service punched in by the operator you talked to 40 minutes ago that calls sometime “around” the quoted time. Thus, it becomes a student’s responsibility to note the quoted time and come outside a few minutes before estimated, rather than waiting for the call before casually walking toward the elevator.
Just as with the change in hours, students deserve to know how Campus Cruiser operates.
Campus Cruiser is, and will continue to be, a highly demanded service at USC. But any change in hours, cars or funding requires  open and honest communication with Campus Cruiser’s highest stakeholder —  the students.
Lauren Yun is a junior majoring in psychology.
DT and Lauren Yun,
This is a textbook case of why the Daily Trojan is a pathetic excuse for our school newspaper. Check out the Daily Bruin for an example of what the DT could be. Since this article touches on misappropriation of USC resources, I think it’d be worth it to have a discussion on whether the USC community is best served by the 4x/week distribution of tens of thousands of copies of this worthless paper. How many more Cruisers could we hire if the entire editorial and publication staff of the DT was reassigned to ATVN’s online bureau and worked for free? Paid journalists and editors shouldn’t be allowed to publish articles like this one. What if we eliminated the printing of the DT and went online-only to save the environment and our tuition money?
USC – if you want real campus news, please read ATVN (www.atvn.org).
There are BLATANT errors in this article, the most egregious being the author’s non-objective point of view and the fact that Cruiser text/phone notifications ARE issued by a command from the car’s driver. I’m not even a Cruiser and I know that. Also, how did you write this ENTIRE article without mentioning USC Transportation and its role in setting the Cruiser budget?
Cruisers, most of us USC students DO appreciate you. Campus Cruiser is absolutely the most comprehensive safe rides organization at any university that I have heard of and it does a fantastic job overall.
Lauren Yun – in your extensive research for this article, did you ever come across the fact that drunk USC students puke in Campus Cruisers fairly regularly on Thursday nights and that the cruiser driver is responsible for cleaning up the vomit? Does that change your perspective on the level of service that our FELLOW TROJANS are providing to us, FOR FREE?
If you have problems with Cruiser’s service, please take a taxi, and remember to tip your driver well.
-Tim
Lauren Yun Sucks
As embarrassing as a blatant fact error is in any newspaper article, perhaps even more embarrassing is the absence of a correction, despite being called out on the flaw. Good to see that even though the information about the calling system is incorrect, it still stands in the article.
Perhaps the DT needs clarity instead of Cruiser.
I have no problem with an article taking to task Campus Cruiser. All campus organizations should be critiqued for the betterment of the university. But it seems like the writer sat down, banged out 350 words on her feelings about the changes, and called it a day.
Others have already pointed out egregious fact errors. I will point out stylistic ones:
1.) “Students routinely complain about not being able to reach an operator, having to wait 30 minutes or more for a car, or sometimes not getting picked up at all.” … whether or not that’s true, your saying so doesn’t prove it.  If, as you say, “It’s not hard to find people who have had problems with Cruiser’s service,” then WHY DIDN’T YOU FIND ANY to interview? It would’ve made this article longer and better substantiated.
2.) “In general, Cruiser’s policy could benefit from more transparency.” Is there any easier way to make a quick point without doing any work? 
This article was short, to whatever point the writer was told to find, and completely devoid of anything worth publishing in the paper. If you’re going to pick on Cruiser, make it count!
I understand your concern about ALL THE PROBLEMS I’m sure you truly believe cruiser to have BUT nothing you have said is really true at all.  This is quite a poor attempt to bring news to the USC community…had you asked any campus cruiser at all they would most likely be happy to discuss with you the Campus Cruiser policies and why things like long holds and wait times (which are rarely over 15minutes) occur…and most of the reasons are because of students like yourself that probably call into cruiser and refuse to go outside to their car unless they get a phone cal or text..which makes no sense..We give you an ETA, so use it…So if people stopped missing there calls then wait times would be lower and guess what hold times would be shorter too!
Seriously, the university of spoiled children needs a wake-up call. If that means waiting for your free ride, I must be crazy.
“It’s an automated service punched in by the operator you talked to 40 minutes ago that calls sometime “around” the quoted time. Thus, it becomes a student’s responsibility to note the quoted time and come outside a few minutes before estimated, rather than waiting for the call before casually walking toward the elevator.”
Did you do any research whatsoever, or just base this on assumption? Your call is sent by your driver once the car arrives. Beside that, it is a courtesy, and if you are given an ETA, you are expected to be waiting for your car at your pickup location at the time given.
“Casually walking toward the elevator…” I’ve had it with entitlement at this school. Maybe a little appreciation for the students who actually have to work to pay for tuition?
This article should be tagged with “incompetent writing” or “falsified information”.
Both work better than inefficient communication.
Would you do this job for free? I certainly wouldn’t. Getting yelled at and insulted by your fellow peers because you don’t have a trust fund to pay for college isn’t worth volunteering my time for. 
The wait time should not include the time you are on hold waiting for an operator to pick up – at any time, there could be up to twenty people calling in at the exact moment and when the drunk people are busy yelling at you for not giving them a ride right away, it takes some time to handle the other calls. And back in the day (two years ago) the wait time was over two hours long – I’m so sorry its inconvenienced you if you had to wait 15 minutes for a ride (sarcastic). 
I’m not trying to attack anyone who wants a safe ride to and from campus. The trams and express routes are there to supplement the drivers. Students try and lie to the phone operators to try and not take the tram which makes it inefficient. Is there anything different from entering a car full of strangers than a bus? The wait time will. The trams this semester have improved significantly with better tracking online. And on a Thursday if you are trying to get from New North to the Row, you can actually take Express which will hold up to 10 people so you don’t have to waste your breath arguing with the operator about how many people you have and why they can’t give you 3 vans.
But when someone is calling to get a ride down the Row because their feet hurt from their heels, I think they are deserving to be made fun of. And sometimes its hard to be nice to every single person that you picked up during your 4/6/8 hour shift when countless others have berated you for being late by a minute or not receiving the text message they were promised. Oh, and after someone who was too drunk to handle themselves throws up in your car, it makes you a little bit angry. 
We are all students – midterms, finals, essays all apply to us too. So excuse us if we’re a little bit grouchy that we have to drive you and your drunk friends to some party after pulling an all-nighter and then having to work. None of us get a free ride when it comes to finals week. 
@Rachel: Drivers do not have friends in the car with them during their work shift. If  they have their friends in the car, its by chance – we try and have social lives outside of serving the spoiled children of USC. And if you really wanted a drivers name, try asking them. We’re real people with real emotions and sometimes if you treat us like a human being with feelings, we might be nice enough to answer. Politely.
Please do some actual reporting. Or even just read the official email that announced the change. You’ll notice it’s from USC Transportation, who are the ones who made the decision, not Campus Cruiser. This has absolutely nothing to do with Cruiser policy, but rather USC Transportation wanting to cut down on costs.
It’s disappointing that this article seems to have completely fabricated info about how the call/text system works.
On another note, though, just because a service is free for students (and appreciated) doesn’t mean we can’t hope to improve it. Campus cruiser definitely isn’t perfect, and while I’m sure some of the riders can be belligerent and annoying, the drivers ARE getting paid and they took this job of their own accord. Sitting in the back of a cruiser while a driver and their friends play loud music and make sexist comments, after waiting over an hour for the cruiser to show up (even if the estimated wait time was 30 minutes), isn’t perfect either but sometimes it’s the only choice for students who don’t want to walk home alone at night and can’t afford a car. 
Trams don’t go everywhere and that’s assumedly the point of campus cruiser, to make students feel safe — instead of being made fun of or attacked for wanting to get a ride at night. Dissing passengers online or even while they’re still in the car is totally unprofessional. I kind of wish the online tracking website told you the driver’s name or had somewhere to write in comments, because while the majority of drivers have been competent and polite, a couple have been downright reckless and rude.
Really DT? Do you make it a priority to write a completely non-researched and untrue article at least once a year. I’m somewhat surprised you even got the time that we open know correct.
1) The estimated time that a cruiser gives you has nothing with when you get the call/text you receive. If a cruiser is 10 min early or late, So will the call you receive.
2) Have you ever listened to the call back system or read the text message?
3) If your phone is in your purse or backpack, on silent, or does not have service you’re either not going to hear or receive your message until after we are gone. You know where busy when you call in and you have to wait on the phone, what makes you think we are going to wait outside your house all night?
4) Lastly, all of us cruisers have to figure out a way home when we get off work at 3am, you know- AFTER CRUISER IS CLOSED!!! if you don’t want a safe ride in the 20 min eta you get, then have a back up plan. call a friend or a taxi even, take the tram that you can track ON YOUR PHONE. 
And if you don’t do that, at least write a paper worthy or a passing grade in WRIT 340
While Ms. Yun suggests that it’s cruiser that “lacks clarity,” the USC community collectively lacks any consciousness of what cruiser really is: the most complex, free transportation system at any of the country’s universities. We pick you up and drive you (often inebriated and rude) to wherever you’d like to go, for 9 hours of the night, for free. If you feel inconvenienced because you must wait for that free service longer than you’d like, feel free to find another way to get home.
But what I think is most important to mention is this: by pitting cruiser against “students,” the writer is suggesting that we are not students ourselves. We are. This article’s tone is condescending and rude, and essentially suggests that if you are so mistaken to need a job to pay for college, your fellow students will critique your shortcomings. If you are going to have the audacity to suggest that our system is not up to par, I’m sure any one of cruiser’s employees would gladly let you shadow us. I guarantee your mind would be quickly changed.
if you want time to “casually walk toward the elevator”, be prepared to face over hour long ETAs starting at 6PM. we try to be as efficient as possible, and we cannot be when people treat it as a service that will wait on them hand and foot. you’re college students; take responsibility and be outside when we tell you it will be there. that being said, WE’RE college students, and it is COMPLETELY student-run, so if you can think of a more efficient way to go about the demand around campus, feel free to enlighten all of us.
And shame on this “publication” for running this article without double-checking the facts.
You literally could have talked to one of our 130 employees, 10 supervisors, or Manager and gotten at least SOME truth in this worthless article.
Wait times would be shorter if people didn’t want rides from Gateway to Troy East or something ridiculous of similar nature. And I’m so sorry that a completely free service is inconveniencing you with extended wait times.
Like other articles written regarding Campus Cruiser – fact checking would be appreciated.
I love Campus Cruiser.  I dread the Trams. Many (not all) of the drivers (esp. route A and B) are rude, have road range, and talk on their phones while driving.
Clarity: it’s a USC Transportation Service budget cut – Transportation, possibly one of the most important departments for students’ safety, I’d say even more so than DPS, provides mostly free services so it’ll be the first one to suffer.  USC will continue to dump money into its athletic department instead.
Yup- ditto to Ken’s comment below
As a worker of cruiser, each driver presses a button on our screens saying that we have arrived. But regardless if a call goes through or not, its the person who is asking for a ride who holds the responsibility of checking up on the status of their cruiser. You can track where your cruiser is online- such a great resource if you dont like relying on the phone call/text.  That way you dont have to wait on hold just to find out where your cruiser is.
Cruiser is honestly a resource that has dramatically evolved over the years, and funds are being reallocated to having more drivers during these peak times instead of having them at the 5o clock hour. Cruiser has also gotten so many new vehicles as a part of the fund distribution as well, just fyi
My friend works for Cruiser and I’ve ridden along a few times before and used the call-back system.  The article is wrong in that you do get the call or text when the cruiser is outside.  The cruiser presses a button on their computer and then the system calls your phone.  So it’s not random from the dispatcher, it calls when they show up, but if you don’t have a signal when it shows up you won’t get the call.
Ken’s right. Or heaven forbid the dispatcher, who is trying to get through your call in 20 seconds or less, punches in one wrong digit for your phone number. Things can get a little frazzled at 1:45 am handling almost 100 calls an  hour. Take responsibility and use the resources available (the online tracker and your ETA). We would please like to remind our patrons: Cruiser is a SAFETY service, NOT a free taxi. So ask yourself next time you call if you truly feel unsafe walking that distance. That would cut down call volume and wait times by a LOT.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) issued its annual survey on urban liveability last week, with only one U.S. city cracking the ranks of the top 30 most liveable cities in the world.
With liveability defined by EIU as political stability, healthcare access, “culture and environment,” education, and infrastructure, Vancouver, Canada took the top spot as the most liveable city of the 140 global cities surveyed for the fifth year running.  Canada and Australia dominated the rankings, with both nations accounting for seven out of the top ten.
The top of the survey is not particularly surprising, given the reputation of cities like Vancouver, Toronto, and Sydney for having dense development and an efficient public transportation network – in addition to easy, widespread access to world-class education and healthcare.  Neither is the bottom of EIU’s survey very earth-shattering – no one would dispute the finding that Harare, Zimbabwe and Douala, Cameroon aren’t particularly liveable.
But the middle of the survey is curious, especially when it comes to which American cities are considered most liveable.
Pittsburgh, Pa. – known more for the NFL’s Pittsburgh Steelers, sandwiches topped with French fries, and an omniscient groundhog than for its liveability – was the only US city to make the top 30.  Even more curiously, Detroit, where virtually a third of the city is abandoned, and Atlanta, with some of the lowest population densities in the nation, were both ranked much more liveable than Portland, Ore., the home of free light rail and urban growth boundaries.
This survey is ultimately proven a farce, however, by EIU’s conclusion that Los Angeles (#44) is more liveable than both London (#53) and New York City (#56).  Such a claim is ridiculous; if you want proof, try to get across town during rush hour without a car.
Most of EIU’s survey consists of rather nebulous comparative statistics – such as “food and drink” within the Culture and Environment category, or “availability of good quality housing” within the Infrastructure category – which may explain some of the oddities in the survey’s conclusions.  At the end of the day, these kinds of surveys are generally meaningless – again, do we really need research to tell us Washington DC is more liveable than Karachi, Pakistan?
Either way, this year’s EIU liveability survey seems especially warped.
