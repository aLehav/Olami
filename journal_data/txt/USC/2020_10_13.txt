Three hundred fifty-five long days after the NBA’s opening night last October, we now have a new champion. Let’s reflect on a chaotic, historic season that — against all odds — came to an end with one team on top. 
The 2019-20 NBA season really began last July with a memorable free agency period with more than 200 players free to sign with new franchises, according to CBS Sports. Some of the biggest names in the pool included Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving. 
Each of these players elected to put on a new uniform for this season, along with a number of other All-Stars. After a hectic free agency and some high-profile trades, including Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers and Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, the NBA looked like a fantasy basketball league, with new pairings of NBA stars in several cities. 
For the first time in a long time, the NBA felt balanced. A lot of teams seemed capable of contending for a title, with no clear favorite: Lakers, Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, Houston Rockets and more were on an even playing field. The All-Star reign in Oakland seemed to have ended.
After such an eventful offseason, the basketball community was excited for the season to begin, and the first few months did not disappoint.
There were a lot of great performances to watch: an unbelievable sophomore campaign from Luka Doncic, another prolific scoring season from James Harden, Irving’s 50-point Brooklyn debut, a close MVP race between Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James and really anything done by Damian Lillard. 
Unfortunately, the events of early 2020 derailed an entertaining season. The tragic loss of Laker legend Kobe Bryant in January rocked the NBA and the city of Los Angeles. His death weighed heavily on the league, the Lakers organization and fans of the game. 
A few weeks later, the 2020 NBA All-Star Game served as largely a tribute to Bryant, one of the few bright moments from the spring. Players all wore either number 24 or 2 to honor Kobe and his late daughter Gianna, respectively. The game format was changed as well. Instead of playing a traditional fourth quarter, the teams played to a target score: 24 points higher than the leading team’s total at the end of the third quarter, another Mamba tribute. Many fans agreed this was the most competitive All-Star Game they had seen in years, and it was just how Kobe would have wanted it. 
Then in March, the coronavirus outbreak brought all sports seasons to a halt. I remember exactly where I was when I learned that the first NBA game in Oklahoma City was postponed — and then March Madness, and then the MLB season. Watching football with fans in seats just feels weird now. 
It was a long time with no sports, and we didn’t know if the NBA’s season would even finish. Then in June, almost three months after the suspension of the season, the NBA announced its plan to resume the season.
From commissioner Adam Silver to the Players’ Association to all of the staff in Orlando that made the NBA bubble possible, it was an incredible effort to finish a season that felt so lost, and everyone deserves recognition. So much went into the planning, organization and execution of this event, and it was spectacularly successful: more than 100 days in the bubble, 22 teams, hundreds of people involved and not a single positive coronavirus test, per ESPN. Bravo. 
The seeding games at the beginning of the NBA restart had some memorable performances, too. What a run from Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Damian Lillard willed the Portland Trail Blazers into the playoffs, taking home the very first (and hopefully only) “Bubble MVP” award. BMVP? 
But Sunday night marked the conclusion of maybe the most unusual NBA season ever — almost a full calendar year, suspended once in March and again briefly in September to protest racial injustice. The fact that the season resumed twice, an entire playoff bracket was played out and there were no coronavirus cases in the bubble is pretty incredible. 
Sunday’s Game 6 ended with the Lakers claiming their seventeenth Larry O’Brien Trophy and their first since Kobe led them to the 2010 championship. 
First things first, I have to give credit to the Miami Heat. They put together a legendary underdog run that we’ll remember for a long time. As the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference, Miami swept Indiana, took down the regular season’s best team, the Bucks, in five games and eliminated a very talented Boston team, the third seed in the East. Missing their leading playoff scorer in Goran Dragic for the majority of the Finals, they still took the Lakers to six games. 
But the Lakers captured the NBA’s ultimate prize in a season where they had the most to fight for. After such a difficult year, and after losing an L.A. legend in Kobe, this city needed a win. The Lakers promised it and they delivered it. There’s finally something to celebrate in Los Angeles.
Yet another brilliant finals performance from LeBron landed him his fourth Finals MVP award. Wearing the KB patch on his jersey, he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists to lead the Lakers past the Heat. Davis dominated on both ends of the floor as well and indicated that he intends to re-sign with L.A. this offseason. 
What a time to be a Lakers fan. Maybe next year, we’ll watch it live at Staples Center.

While much of the learning done in college is valuable, a significant proportion of students don’t actually use their undergraduate degree in their future career. Even though a college education is a useful experience with regard to diversity of thought and academic rigor, students would be much better off if they were permitted to explore areas of interest without the pressure of needing to fit in units or prerequisites. 
At 18 years old, the human brain is not fully developed. Until the prefrontal cortex develops by around age 25, the logical decision-making part of the brain has technically not entirely matured. Asking students fresh out of high school to make decisions that impact the next four years of their life (and possibly longer) is not only daunting — it’s scientifically impractical. 
The concept of college majors itself is outdated. Prerequisites, co-requisites, lower-division requirements and upper-division classes make it difficult to switch into programs or change concentrations of study. Some more rigorous programs offer little to no room for electives to explore other areas of study, and with students trying to save money and graduate in four years, they often prioritize and cram in required classes. 
All of this is not to say that there aren’t exceptions. Some more technically-advanced classes inevitably require additional coursework to prepare and be successful. However, by setting a precedent of exploration and an attitude of open-mindedness, there is no reason that universities shouldn’t encourage and make it easier for students to step out of their comfort zone.
Some students have known exactly what field or profession they’d like to pursue since an early age or applied to a university to concentrate in a specific field. Still, undergraduate education should offer a chance for them to explore other areas of study outside of their own expertise. 
While a university’s general education courses, or GEs, are a surefire way to make sure that even the most STEM-y of majors get a good dose of the humanities, students are often limited by course category and scheduling conflicts and may end up in classes they aren’t necessarily interested in. Students are simply more engaged in learning when it’s about a topic they find fascinating –– or, unlike those pesky lower-division math requirements, something that is taught in a way relevant to their interests.
Some schools have already recognized how arbitrary and old-fashioned the current system is. Brown University’s Open Curriculum program allows students to complete their core course requirements and essentially build their own course of study. With more than 80 “concentration” offerings, Brown allows students the flexibility to build their own curriculum and work closely with academic advisers to craft a course plan that aligns with their specific interests and areas of study.
By enabling students to actively participate in their own education, choosing specific concentration classes and synthesizing an academic experience from a wide range of academia, Brown has created an unmatched atmosphere of academic customization and support. Additionally, the unique grading scale at Brown doesn’t take failed classes into account or calculate GPA, encouraging students to pursue their academic curiosity without the deterrent of a bad grade.
With prestigious schools such as Stanford, Claremont McKenna and the University of Chicago setting the deadline to commit to a major well into a student’s college journey, it’s clear that the traditional method of entering college having declared and committed to a major of study is on its way out. By giving students more time to dabble in many areas of study before deciding which they’d like to pursue in depth, colleges have the potential to create an entirely new and more sustainable learning environment. 
While USC does have the little-advertised option of building one’s own major, having the ability to more freely customize classes and course loads to tailor to one’s unique interests would be more beneficial for all students. The Dornsife Interdisciplinary Major Program allows students to design their own area of study, developing a “thematic curriculum” and an independent research project. However, entrance to this program is extremely competitive, with GPA requirements, a tentative thesis proposal and writing supplements.
The University does encourage students to pursue multiple areas of academic study, incentivizing such accomplishments with recognitions like the Renaissance Award. However, adopting a culture of exploration and curiosity over the current achievement-driven mindset is key.
By encouraging all students to test the waters from the start, colleges have started capitalizing on the opportunity to create engaging and customizable learning experiences without necessarily locking a student into a single course of study that leads to a specific job.
People are constantly developing and changing as they age, finding new hobbies, interests and ideas. While there may be no perfect-fit major for any college student, allowing increased leniency and flexibility in course plans and areas of study would create more well-rounded, well-adjusted and passionate students who are better equipped to succeed after graduation.

President Donald Trump’s comments about Hunter Biden’s drug addiction were among the numerous attacks brought up against former Vice President Joe Biden in the first presidential debate. Beyond an attempt to stray from policy-related discussion, the president sought to shame Biden and his family due to his son’s history of cocaine use. Rather than revealing scandalous details about his opponent, the president successfully undermined the severity of drug abuse and mental illness more broadly in his comments. 
Mental health issues already come hand-in-hand with stigma, in large part due to the history of misinformation and even discrimination surrounding the afflicted. However, Trump’s comments render themselves particularly lamentable given the deep public stigma held about drug addiction. According to a study published in Behavior Analysis in Practice, people suffering from drug addiction face even worse discrimination for their illness than those with other mental health concerns and are often looked down upon for their perceived lack of willpower or moral ineptitude. 
Much of the stigma associated with addiction has to do with the challenge of even defining the problem as a disease. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a United States government-funded research institute, addiction is defined as a chronic disease. Repeated drug use chemically inhibits the brain’s ability to exercise self-control and ultimately resist urges to future drug use. It causes ongoing changes within the brain, making the illness especially susceptible to relapse. 
It is in the interest of the president, or any U.S. government official, to have an informed understanding of substance abuse and its severity. 
According to research analysis by the Closing the Addiction Treatment Gap initiative, 23.5 million Americans are addicted to alcohol and drugs, accounting for approximately one in every 10 Americans over the age of 12. Drug overdose-related deaths have more than tripled since 1990 and numerous Americans have said that drug addiction is a growing problem in their local communities, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center. 
There is certainly hope for recovery from drug addiction, although treatment does not necessarily provide a cure. Rather, due to the fact that addiction is chronic, treatment and recovery often enable the survivor to manage their illness long-term. 
Numerous advocacy organizations over the past several years have pushed for increased awareness and broader access to addiction treatment, as only 11% of those suffering receive such help. This has created a serious treatment gap between more than 20 million Americans, along with a host of economic consequences. 
In 2018, substance abuse cost the United States more than $600 billion, due to combined costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. However, treatment is proven to be far less costly than incarceration of persons with abuse issues. 
According to the NIDA, the average cost of one year of treatment for methadone addiction is approximately $4,700 per patient, while a full year of imprisonment costs around $24,000 per person. In addition to bringing about important economic benefits, improving access to treatment will result in improved societal well-being, with a reduction in drug-related accidents and overdoses. 
Barriers to treatment and the continued practice of incarcerating members of our society who suffer from drug abuse only reinforce disparities within our public health system. Our failure to achieve a holistically well society will be an ongoing concern so long as addiction remains stigmatized and even politicized. 
The president’s comments about Hunter Biden highlight the attitudes that have invalidated drug abuse as a serious medical concern and public health crisis and contributed to undue inequity in our society. His comments alienated the percentage of his constituency who suffer from substance abuse and arguably, the 26% of Americans ages 18 and older who also suffer from a diagnosable mental illness. It is abundantly clear that attempts to tackle drug abuse and mental illness are not a priority of his administration. 
Recovery from drug addiction is hard, although not impossible, and with recovery comes a great deal of bravery and strength on the part of the survivor and their family. The former vice president’s response to Trump’s egregious remark, stating “I’m proud of my son,” highlights the sort of care and sensitivity needed to support all Americans struggling with addiction and our ongoing hope toward building a healthier nation.

The Iovine Young Academy and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism have partnered to create the News and Information minor, which will be open to all students starting Spring 2021. 
The minor aims to help students rethink modern news coverage and equip them with the skillset to use new technologies in reporting, according to Laura Davis, a journalism professor who helped create the minor. 
“I think there are students all over the university who care about the credibility of information and an informed democracy,” Davis said. “They might not see traditional training in journalism as the path for that.”
The curriculum emphasizes innovation in journalism and is the academy’s second collaborative degree, after the release of the health innovation minor with Keck School of Medicine for Spring 2020. 
“We really enjoyed working with other schools,” said Patrick Dent, associate professor of technology at IYA. “We liked the idea of taking domain expertise and combining it with our material … The rest of it was really trying to figure out what are some courses rooted in the pedagogy of the Academy that would be useful for journalism and general students and then what are some journalism classes that are allowing non-majors to allow Academy and other students from the University to kind of see their mindset.”
Davis and journalism professor Rebecca Haggerty, who also helped create the minor, wanted to combine the curricula of both schools to emphasize the role of technology and innovation in modern media. The Academy’s human-centered design teaching and Annenberg’s reporting curriculum worked well together, and Davis and Haggerty launched a plan to advance the training students received in information-gathering and presentation.
“A lot of what gets attention is mis- and disinformation, and reliable information that our journalists are learning gets buried,” Davis said. “The main goal is to make them more effective in conveying information in today’s media landscape.”
The news side of the minor focuses on innovative engagement with various audiences, emphasizing particularly younger demographics, Haggerty said. 
“Part of the human-centered design is thinking about … reliable news and information is so important,” she said. “It is important in our society that people have access to reliable news and information.”
The minor requires 20 units across both schools, including a new course, “Advancing Journalism with Human-Centered Design,” co-written by Davis and IYA Assistant Dean of Academic Strategy Matthew Manos. The course is co-taught by both Annenberg and IYA professors, aiming to combine reporting training with human centered design as an introductory course to the minor. 
Additionally, students can choose from an array of courses across the schools to satisfy the four unit elective requirement, including “The Hacker Imagination: From Ancient Greece to Cupertino” and “Hands-on Disruption: Experimenting with Emerging Technology.” 
“We want to give students the skills not only to innovate but to apply that to a newsroom,” Davis said. “It’s for the student who looks at the state of news and information in today’s media ecosystem and says, ‘I know we can do better.’”
