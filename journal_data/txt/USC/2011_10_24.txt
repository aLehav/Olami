The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office and the California Fair Political Practices Commission, a state government agency responsible for overseeing campaigns, lobbying and conflict of interest in law, have launched investigations into possible conflicts of interest at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after former Coliseum General Manager Patrick Lynch received payments from a contractor.
Lynch received an estimated $300,000 from a stadium contractor.
Documents and interviews confirmed that former contractor Tony Estrada deposited the money for Lynch in a Miami bank account beginning in 2006.
These new findings, part of an eight-month financial scandal surrounding the taxpayer-owned Coliseum, were investigated by the Coliseum Commission, which is composed of political appointees from the city, county and state. The results were released to the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office, which disseminated the information to the public on Saturday.
“The allegations became known to the commission,” Coliseum Commission President David Israel told the Los Angeles Times. “The commission investigated them and turned over the results to the district attorney. If the allegations are true, then the Coliseum is the victim of a crime.”
Bernard Parks, a Los Angeles City Councilman representing the city’s Eighth District, which includes USC and the Coliseum, and a member of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, said he foresees no immediate effects on the negotiations.
“The Coliseum has been negotiating on a lease with USC for about a month now,” Bernard said. “I don’t believe the revelations will have any impact on those negotiations.”
Estrada claims the funds were allocated to create a new corporation to take over his janitorial company and Tony Capozzola, Lynch’s attorney, maintains the finances were unrelated to stadium affairs. The money was intended as payment for Lynch’s boat as well as for the purchase of another boat, according to Capozzola.
Speculation of the payments was brought to light to Coliseum officials after a falling out between Lynch and Estrada. It is unknown, however, how much money, if any, still remains in Lynch’s Miami bank account, as a second boat was never purchased. Lynch unexpectedly resigned as general manager of the Coliseum in Feb. 2011, after it was revealed that a Coliseum employee under Lynch’s tenure also worked for an event promotion company that regularly held events at the Coliseum.
Legal and financial details concerning the university’s acquisition of the master lease will be discussed at the commission’s next meeting on Dec. 7. USC’s current lease stipulates the university will give the commission 8 percent of ticket sales and $1.8 million annually in exchange for renovations of the Coliseum.

A repeal of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act sponsored by State Assemblyman Tim Donnelly has received significant student support in its first week.
The DREAM Act, signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown on Oct. 10, allows undocumented college students to qualify for and receive state financial aid. If Donnelly obtains valid signatures from 504,760 registered California voters before Jan. 6, a ballot measure to repeal the DREAM Act will appear on the Nov. 2012 ballot.
Source: Californiadreamact.org - Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
The petition received 7,800 signatures in its first week, and 20 percent was from college students, according to Donnelly.
Donnelly disapproves of the DREAM Act because he says it provides illegal immigrants with some of the same benefits legal residents have.
“We need to have one standard, and offering money to illegal immigrants is just wrong in so many ways,” Donnelly said. “Giving them the same benefits as legal residents and U.S. citizens who’ve worked so hard is wrong.”
Aimee Chang, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said the DREAM Act should be repealed because it could negatively affect U.S. citizens.
“[The DREAM Act] should be repealed because it can really have a negative impact for American citizens,” Chang said. “It is already hard enough to get adequate financial aid as it is.”
Alex Chin, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said given the current state of the U.S. economy, money should be spent on citizens rather than on illegal immigrants.
“The economy is in a major slump right now,” Chin said. “By allowing illegal immigrants to obtain financial aid, we’re spending tax dollars on them when we really should be spending it on the education of U.S. citizens.”
College students already pay high prices to attend college and government funds should be directed to help alleviate the financial burden of college for legal residents, Donnelly said.
“What I hear college students complaining [about] the most is not getting their classes,” Donnelly said. “A four year education should not take five years. We’ve broken the promise to students that we will pay for their education and we should fix this instead of paying for the tuition of illegal immigrants.”
Other students, however, said they  believe undocumented students should not be prevented from receiving financial aid.
“Students who graduate from California high schools should receive funding to attend [public] California universities,” said Katrina Kaiser, a sophomore majoring in economics. “[Undocumented students] have integrated into the California community, culture and economic fabric.”
Rosie…you are one of the most ignorant people I have ever read on any site….you think paying roughly 9% sales tax on a 100$ bag of groceries even comes close to paying for what they take from the system. Everything we have, roads, hospitals, schools, parks, are all based on a formula that depends on tax revenue. Tax revenue is calculated on how many people are working and earning an income…because income taxes are the biggest revenue generator….when you have millions of illegals taking from the system, but not contributing income tax…guess what, you have a huge hole….FACT, we have one of the biggest population of illegal immigrants in the country…FACT, we have one of the more liberal, generous, entitlement programs in the country, including large sums of money going to illegal immigrants. FACT, most immigrant laws are not enforced in california. FACT, Ca ecomomy is broke and near collapse. I know we all want to be nice people, but we have to take care of us first and foremost. We cannot continue to give what we have away to those who dont live here legally. if we do, we will lose it all. If you think life is hard now, wait untill what we have collapses. Rosie, educate yourself with REALITY. stop running around with ignorant ideas and opinions that are hurtful to America…and PLEASE STOP BLAMING AMERICA.
1st: API students = API’s are 2nd largest undocumented student population!!! – OUTRIGHT LIE. THERE ARE NO STATS TO BACK THIS UP
2nd: MANY if not MOST undocumented pay taxes! MORE RICH CITIZENS (ie: large corporatations, banks) are the tax evaders! – BIGGEST LIE EVER. MOST ILLEGALS WORK UNDER A FAKE SSN, AND EVEN MORE WORK UNDER THE TABLE. AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PAYING TAXES IS THE RARE EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE YOU LIAR.
3rd: PREVENTION and support has STRONGLY been found to reduce the overall societal cost aka: spend now and help these undocumented kids now, reduces bigger costs later! NOT EVEN CLOSE BEING  A FACT BASED IN REALITY. CA IS BROKE LARGELY BECAUSE WE KEEP GIVING LOADS OF MONEY THOSE THOSE WHO DONT PUT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. ALSO, THE TOP 10% OF WAGE EARNERS IN THIS COUNTRY PAY ROUGHLY 80% OF THE TAXES. ROUGHLY 50% OF THE POULATION PAYS ZERO. YOUR ARE NOTHING BUT A LIAR. YOUR FANTASY FACTS ARE OURTIGHT LIES.
4th: these kids didn’t ask to be brought here. NOT OUR PROBLEM. THESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPLY AS A FOREIGN STUDENT, AND PAY THE SAME TUITION AS FOREIGN STUDENTS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE GETTING FREE MONEY FROM A BROKE SYSTEM THAT IS BROKE BECAUSE IT HAS TO MANY LEACHES WHO ONLY TAKE, BUT DO NOT GIVE BACK. IF THESE KIDS WANT TO BLAME SOMEONE, THEY CAN BLAME THEIR PARENTS FOR BREAKING THE LAW TO BRING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY. WE ALL PAY FOR THE SINS OF OUR PARENTS. I WOULD RATHER HELP OUT AMERICAN CHILDEREN. 
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A HATER OF AMERICA AND ITS PEOPLE. YOU ARE SO IGNORANT YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO CREATE THE JOBS WE ALL NEED ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THIS COUNTRY. NO, ITS THOSE WHO BREAK OUR LAWS AND VIOLATE OUR SOVEREIGNTY THAT CAUSE IMMEASURABLE DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY. IT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR TO EXPECT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, OR THE USA, TO PAY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT A LEGAL PART OF OUR COUNTRY. IF YOU THE WRITER FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT EDUCATING ILLEGALS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DONATE YOUR ENTIRE SALARY TO THEM, NOT MINE. IN OTEHR WORD, PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOU MOUTH IS.
THE APPEAL OF THE DREAM ACT ISNT AS MUCH RACISTS AS YOUR IDEAS ARE THOSE OF A  BIGGOTED ANT-IAMERICAN. I AM TIRED OF THOSE WHO WANT TO STEAL FROM AND ATTACK AMERICA, AND BLAME US FOR EVERYTHING.
Are citizens afraid of competition? Isn’t that what capitalism is all about……? If a college student is smarter and works harder to get a career, shouldn’t we regard that, regardless of immigration status? Why are we hard on immigrants now if in the past they were received with open arms and access to public benefits? Shouldn’t we invest in all young people that want something better for this country? The California Dream Act sets the state on the path to a more prosperous future, economically and socially. If anything, that is what has made California so great….
You are deliberately confusing Illegal and Legal Immigrants.  CA Community College does not require a minimum GPA (fee-tuition waivers and EOPS) while most of the other State aid being given to AB 131 Illegal Alien Students requires only a 2.0-2.6 GPA.  Honest competition?–I don’t think so.
This is clearly Economic Discrimination against US Citizens, Legal Californian Residents, and Legal Immigrants who have seen their tuition rates rise dramatically while not being eligible or have seen their financial aid reduced. It is this discriminated population who ARE our FUTURE.
Also, with the heavy recruitment of out-of-state and Foreign Nationals who can pay nearly twice the in-state tuition rate to refund our defunct education system, Legal Californian Residents and Legal Immigrants will be “priced out” and “placed out” of THEIR American Dream, THEIR higher education.
so much ignorance and racism… THIS IS A SAD SAD trend in our young society!
1st: API students = API’s are 2nd largest undocumented student population!!!
2nd: MANY if not MOST undocumented pay taxes! MORE RICH CITIZENS (ie: large corporatations, banks) are the tax evaders!
3rd: PREVENTION and support has STRONGLY been found to reduce the overall societal cost aka: spend now and help these undocumented kids now, reduces bigger costs later!
4th: these kids didn’t ask to be brought here.
I am tired of reading uneducated racist rants! Most of these students want to be positively contributing, giving members of society.
Give them the chance before forgetting that most of you came from some other part of the world wanting a “better life” for your kids, grandchildren, great-great…
You’re being off-topic and misleading.  Illegal Aliens pay little in taxes when they work low-paying menial, cash, under-the-counter, non-reportable income.  It cannot compare to the amount contributed in “taxes” with the amount that is sucked from our social services, education, and healthcare systems.  Did you know that Illegal Aliens can take a $1,000 per child tax credit it they decide to “file” taxes, using an ITIN?  Thank a whistle-blower that this loophole will be rescinded soon.
I see no one in this forum mentioning “race” until you.  You’re the one being a racist and classist and deliberately trying to divert from the subject.  Perhaps you are still succumbing to the tired rhetoric that being against Illegal Aliens is being racist.  I think only a UC undergrad from Berkeley will swallow that one.  You’re the one spreading hate against US Citizens, Legal Californian Residents and Legal Immigrants who are entitled to their financial aid, their need for a world-class higher education (now much diminished) because THEY ARE OUR FUTURE!

We CAN’T afford this. We can’t even support students who are here legally!!!
@Justine – $14.5MM is money better spent toward students who are here LEGALLY. It is unfortunate their parents broke the law. If and of them are working here ILLEGALLY then they are not paying TAXES, which means that the TAXPAYERS are paying for their education – in other words, they are stealing from the taxpayers. I am having a hard enough time putting my children through college in this bankrupt state. Overcrowding in the community colleges has made it virtually impossible for my daughter to get the classes she needs. Why should legal citizens have to go to community college for 3 years for a 2 year degree, just so all of the illegals can get an education? It’s not right, and it’s not fair. I will be signing the petition, and finding hundreds of other voters to do the same.
And here’s how AB 131 does not help anyone:

agreed
First of all, please explain to me HOW they do not pay taxes? Last time I remember when they go shopping they get taxed, when they work (even illegally) they get taxed, when they go to college they get taxed! And also, since WHEN? are taxpayers paying for their college education? Because hey the DREAM does not go into effect until 2013, so currently these student work harder, than any other American citizen! yes I said it, to go to college because hey they work hard working who knows how many jobs and applying for academic scholarships. Please get your facts straights and read the news because then you will just be infecting people with your ignorant lies. 
FYI tell your children that there is OTHER type of aid besides the government. Like jobs, internships, scholarships. Also, community college is still a good valuable education so don’t discredit it. It just all depends how students make the best of it for their future.
This site won’t let me post URLs, so:
LA Times 9/01/11 “State Senate Oks Part of California DREAM Act
For the first year alone:
“It is not known how many undocumented students would be eligible for the aid. A Senate committee analysis estimated the bill’s cost at about $40 million. That includes $13 million for Cal Grants, which average about $4,500; up to $15 million in community college waivers; and $12 million in institutional aid from the University of California and California State University systems.”
“On behalf of the California Student Aid Commission, I am requesting a correction to a quote attributed to me, Lori Nezhura, Legislative Director for the California Student Aid Commission, in the “Trying to Keep the Dream Alive” article posted on July 14, 2011 on EGPNews.com.
It is imperative that your readers be informed that the number of High School Entitlement Cal Grants and Transfer Entitlement Cal Grants are unlimited and available to all students meeting financial need, GPA, and other eligibility criteria. Therefore, if passed, Dream Act students will be able to receive these awards if they meet the same requirements.
Conversely, the number of Competitive Cal Grants is limited. However, the bill stipulates that Dream Act students may only receive one of these awards provided funds remain after all eligible non-AB 540 California residents are awarded.”
Also, Community College does not have a minimum GPA (fee-tuition waivers and EOPS) and most other State aid requires only a 2.0-2.6 GPA.  Most Aid is given on a “need” basis and is not competitive.  The Best and The Brightest???–I don’t think so.
Misinformation can lead to Legal Californian Residents and Legal Immigrants to lose out their chance to THEIR right to a higher education, THEIR American Dream when they have seen their tuition go up dramatically, while not being eligible or have seen their aid reduced.  THEIR only option is to be saddled with crippling Loan Debt.
Got to Facebook, Stand With California (And Against Illegal Immigration) and to StopAB131  dot  com.
The money that may be available to undocumented students is only AFTER the rest of students are covered. So it’s not that Americans are being denied $ for school. 
I agree that there is a lack of transparency, but that exists with just about everything. Yet I feel it is wrong to deny someone who is TRYING to further themselves and get an education. Most have been raised in America, are assimilated and who is to say that within the pool of undocumented students may not be the next person to make a life changing discovery. 
If it was an easy process for a young person who was raised in the U.S. to become a citizen I would oppose the Act, but since it is NOT a simple process then why not give them help when they are actively trying to better themselves. This is not welfare, this is education and it is left over $ (if there is any) after citizens get their $.
If there is ANY money available after all the citizens are taken care of, that “extra” isn’t really extra and could, no, SHOULD be used to give help to additional citizens and LEGAL immigrants who qualify.
There is no “extra…”  We’re broker than broke.
@Misinformation Breeds Hate
AGREED! people just seem to prefer to remain ignorant and not learn the facts, so as a result they lash out on undocumented AMERICANS, when the true problem lies with our government who kept cutting away at our education.

First, the DREAM act was supposed to only draw from private funds. Now it’s going to draw on state funding. 
There is a lack of transparency when it comes to budgeting in CA, and hence CA’s budget in the red. So 14.5 M$ is specious; I bet they want to draw a lot more than that. 
I say NO to your DREAM.
You are “dreaming” if you do not think that this Act will not cost taxpayers money and take away dollars for education from legal American citizens.  Funds are limited  and the state of California can not pay its own bills.  Private dollars are limited as well.  This Act can only hurt U. S. Citizens and in response to the above comment, get to know a legal student first before you think about opposing the CA DREAM Act.
The people who oppose the CA DREAM Act only oppose it because they are being given false information, from people like Donnelly. This bill will not affect citizens directly or negatively, it will cost $14.5 million but that is nothing compared to the whole budget towards financial aid for public schools, which is $1 billion. That’s not even 1% of the budget. Opponents of the bill that go to private schools don’t really give a *@$% about the bill because citizens and legal residents already have the advantage to pay for such an expensive tuition anyway, but undocumented students face many struggles that people don’t see. Get to know an undocumented student first, before you think about opposing the CA DREAM Act.
Regardless of the struggles they may face, we as a nation are not obligated to subsidize another country’s poor. There are plenty of poor citizens and legal immigrants who should get this money. That measly 1% can help more people that need the money who are here legally. Get to know some of the poor citizens this will take opportunity from before you think about supporting the CA DREAM Act
Justine: why should citizens and legal residents be forced to pay for the tertiary education of illegal immigrants? That $14.5 M didn’t appear out of thin air. If the illegal immigrants qualify for this low income-based financial aid, their eligibility corroborates the popular belief that their tax contributions to such public funding are negligible if not zero.

Students assembled near Tommy Trojan for three hours on Monday in an effort to start an Occupy USC movement to show solidarity for Occupy Wall Street protesters.
Occupy · Nick Paladines, a senior majoring in international relations, stood in front of Tommy Trojan on Monday as part of Occupy USC. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
USC College Democrats organized the event that had between 15 and 30 protesters at various times.
“[It is] not a partisan movement,” said Ximena Velázquez, president of USC College Democrats. “But within our club we had a lot of people who wanted to participate in a solidarity movement for the Wall Street protesters.”
Alex Bakken, a junior majoring in environmental engineering, said though he disagreed with some of the protesters’ points, he respected their efforts.
“It will stick with a lot of us and we will be more conscious of these things when we go into the working world,” he said. “I’m sure it will have some impact on students’ thinking since a lot of us will be affected by it.”
Though displaying support for Wall Street protesters is still a chief goal of Occupy USC, the emphasis has shifted to focus on issues related specifically to the USC campus, said Kaya Masler, political director for USC College Democrats.
“[Occupy USC is] a place for people to come together and express common concerns and interests … as [they] relate to the USC campus,” Masler said.
After the protest ended at 3 p.m., the Occupy USC General Assembly, which comprised the majority of the protesters, met near Tommy Trojan. At the meeting, students wrote down what they believe Occupy USC is about and their goals for the demonstrations. The assembly will have a second meeting Friday to announce its specific goals.
Organizers plan to continue Occupy USC every weekday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in front of Tommy Trojan. Planners will alternate responsibility when they are in class.
Protest organizers said they hope the campus demonstrations will add momentum to the national Occupy movement.
“What I’m seeing is a way for USC to contribute to something that is growing all over the world,” Masler said.
Throughout the demonstration, the protesters received a range of feedback, including a few impolite reactions.
“We had a few rude spectators, but most people were curious about our movement [and] a few people joined in,” Velazquez said.
Velazquez also said  Occupy USC was meant to set an example for other California schools looking to start an Occupy protest.
This is a joke right?  Its actually perfect, get all the idiots in one place movement …….. go back to school folks ….
They know not what they’re protesting, Katman.  It’s simply easier than actually getting up and going to class.
Wait ’til they take a look at their own kids’ tuition bills.  They may wished they’d found something worthwhile to do.

12.5% of the planets have 71% of the mass. #OccupyJupiter
Where’s the Marshall students? They should be in this too.
Everyone’s looking for a handout. I’m fearful of this class warfare mentality.
I wish you guys would just read non-main-stream media, or maybe not watch the same news channels as the majority of people. 
The protests are against wealth disparity, corruption within congress, oligarchical tendencies in our government, the growing corporatocracy, general ignorance (I.E. The Katman). These protests are going to be a way to draw awareness to those things within a university setting, especially here at USC. 
In Conclusion, read books, not the lips of O’Reilly.
They are protesting their families wealth that is no doubt paying their tuition.
Then, either they’ve got some balls to be protesting against a system that benefits them (that has NEVER been done in history. Not even, say, Karl Marx, would do something like that!), or something is wrong with a system that only educates the people born wealthy. This may be seemingly ironic except let me point out that wealth and political ideology actually don’t always have to go together!
Katman,
Can’t you see they are part of something big with the goal of…………..will get back to you.
what, specifically, are you protesting about?

Senior linebacker Chris Galippo apologized Monday for comments made in the wake of USC’s 31-17 victory at Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., on Saturday.
“If I offended anyone with my postgame comments Saturday, I do apologize,” Galippo tweeted. “I have great respect for their players and their program.”
Galippo said the Irish had “quit” after opting not to call timeouts in the waning minutes of the game — allowing the Trojans to run out the clock.
Galippo was originally recruited by Notre Dame out of high school, along with USC.
“At the end there, when they didn’t call those timeouts, they just quit,” Galippo said in the moments following the game. “That’s what Notre Dame football is about. They’re not anything like USC.”
USC coach Lane Kiffin apologized to Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly via telephone for Galippo’s remarks.
During a conference call with the media Sunday night, Kiffin said he had spoken with Galippo about the comments and assured the media that the matter had been resolved on both sides, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“On behalf of our football program, I apologize for Chris Galippo’s statements after the game,” Kiffin told reporters during the teleconference. “I also called coach Kelly to personally apologize. As I said to the media immediately after the game, I thought Notre Dame played extremely hard throughout the game.”
Kiffin did say he was surprised at how the Fighting Irish handled the end of the game.
“Obviously, [more than] two minutes left with three timeouts, there’s a lot of football left,” Kiffin said in regard to Notre Dame not using [its] timeouts toward the end of the contest. “But I’m not complaining.”
Galippo wasn’t the only player surprised with Notre Dame’s late-game strategy Saturday.
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley expressed similar sentiments during an interview with Max Kellerman and Marcellus Wiley on 710 ESPN radio in Los Angeles on Monday.
“It seemed from our sideline and our perspective that they did give up,” Barkley said. “It seemed uncharacteristic of Notre Dame. I wouldn’t have wanted to have been on that sideline.”
I cogratulate the Trojan football team for the decisive victory over Notre Dame, but I think the comments made by many in the USC football showed an utter lack of class, and reflect poorly on your wonderful university.  Did Chris Galippo really apologize, or is this a case of the athletic department writing a script that was then routed to the press via the head coach? You came to town, to our house, you dominated from the opening whistle to the final gun. Take your well-deserved victory, and simply leave for home with grace. One might say that there is a certain karma attached to the end story of this game,and it cannot be one that the nation of Troy needs after the escapades of your recent past.
The kids (Gallipo, Barkley) are just calling it as they see it. I’m not at all surprise that the Irish handled the last few minutes of the game with all time outs still available for them. 
“the un-luck of the irish.”
@tommytrojan09
Kelly even told the press that his team “doesnt know how to win”.  Yes they do, but their coach gave up, not the players.  Kiffin’s response was politically correct, though it cant change the fact that Kelly lost his team.
SC needs to shut up and play Trojan football. These comments are low class and reflect a lack of maturity. Guess next years ND motivation? Barkley and Gallipo have not always been at their best!

Wasting no time in finalizing his bid for the International Tennis Association National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento took home the singles crown at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships without losing a single set over the course of the entire tournament.
Dominant · Sophomore Ray Sarmiento beat Fresno State’s Francis Alcantra 6-4, 6-3 to win the Trojans’ first regional singles title in a decade. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Sarmiento, ranked No. 15 in the ITA rankings and seeded No. 2 in the five-day competition, defeated No. 15 seed Pepperdine’s Francis Alcantara 6-4, 6-3 in the finals to take home the crown.
No Trojan had won a singles title at the ITA regionals since 2000.
As the singles champion of the regionals, Sarmiento earns an automatic bid to the prestigious ITA Indoor Championships in Flushing, N.Y., in early November.
USC senior No. 16 Daniel Nguyen will join Sarmiento, who had already earned a bid to the tournament for his play in the ITA All-American Championship earlier this month, in Flushing.
Pepperdine’s No. 19 Finn Tearney challenged Sarmiento in the first set of the semifinals before the eventual champion pulled away to win it 7-5. Sarmiento then finished the match with a 6-1 set over the No. 3 seed of the tournament.
After a bye in the first round, Sarmiento had defeated five consecutive opponents before his finals matchup against Alcantara.
“In the beginning, [Alcantara] took me out of my game and neutralized my forehand, but I took advantage of his backhand,” Sarmiento said. “He is a tricky player. He can take you out of your game really quickly and take advantage of errors.”
The finals nearly featured two USC players, but Alcantara defeated USC freshman Yannick Hanfmann 6-3, 6-3 in the semifinals to prevent an all-Trojan clash.
“The semifinals were a little disappointing,” Hanfmann said.
Seeded No. 12 in the tournament, Hanfmann endured a tough run to the semifinals, upsetting No. 10 Sebastian Fanselow of Pepperdone, No. 1 in the tournament, 6-4, 6-4 in the round of 16.
In the next round, Hanfmann pulled off another upset against San Diego’s No. 56 Nikola Bubnic 6-4, 6-4.
“I wanted to play [Yannick] in the finals,” Sarmiento said. “He’s been playing really well for us. He has a really big game and can beat anyone in the country.”
USC sophomore Emilio Gomez, No. 66 in ITA rankings and No. 8 in the regionals, saw his undefeated singles record come to an end after losing 3-6, 2-6 to No. 111 Mousheg Hovhannisyan of Pepperdine in the round of 16.
USC freshman Eric Johnson also made a run to the round of 16. Johnson had upset the No. 17 seed, UCSB’s Mathieu Forget ,6-4, 6-4 in the round of 32 before barely losing to San Diego’s No. 67 Clarke Spinosa 6-1, 5-7, 2-6.
USC sophomore Corey Smith and freshman Jonny Wang also participated in the singles draw, victorious in the first round before losing to seeded players.
The 64-team doubles draw featured three USC teams, with the doubles champions also earning bids to the indoor championships in New York.
The No. 3 pair of Hanfmann and Nguyen, and the No. 5 pair of Gomez and Sarmiento, were upset in the quarterfinals.
After dispatching pairs from Fresno State and Pepperdine, Gomez and Sarmiento lost 3-8 to the No. 9 Bubnic and Thibaut Visy, who eventually captured the doubles title.
“Doubles could have been better, but we’ll continue to find our game as the year goes on,” Sarmiento said. “Emilio and I are getting better every day in practice.”
On the other side of the doubles bracket, Hanfmann and Nguyen defeated pairs from San Diego State and UCLA before losing 3-8 to No. 6 Alcantara and Remi Boutillier of Fresno State.
“We had some early struggles,” Hanfmann said. “I lost in the service game, and it’s not easy to come back. Maybe next time.”
Johnson and Wang also paired up in the doubles draw, winning in the first round before a 4-8 loss in the next round to No. 9 seed UCI’s Ryan Cheung and Fabian Mathews.
Sarmiento and Nguyen will focus on their preparations for the ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, scheduled to take place from Nov. 3 to Nov. 6 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing.

After a quick three-and-out by Notre Dame to start the game on Saturday, USC took over possession and proceeded to do exactly the opposite of what everyone expected — it ran the ball.
If USC coach Lane Kiffin would have proposed this game plan to the USC faithful before the Trojans’ first snap, I would have put money down that a good ole’ Tennessee-style headhunt would ensue.
After all, running the ball didn’t make a whole lot of sense in the current situation — at least, not according to conventional wisdom.
For one, the Trojans sport one of the best receiving corps in the nation, with All-American junior quarterback Matt Barkley slinging the ball better than he ever has at USC. USC faced a secondary that, in addition to being ranked 59th in the country in pass defense, proved wholly ineffective in a big game setting when the Fighting Irish were shredded by Michigan in week two.
But even more pertinent are the Trojans’ previous concerns with their running game. In addition to having a depleted and relatively inexperienced offensive line leading the charge, USC has dealt with yet another merry-go-round of starting tailbacks, as injuries and production issues have once again clouded the decision of who should be atop the depth chart.
But a funny thing happened on that first run — it worked. Senior tailback Marc Tyler ran for 15 yards and a first down on the Trojans’ first play from scrimmage.
So USC continued to run the ball. So much so, that by the end of the Trojans’ first touchdown-scoring drive, they had run the ball on 11 of 13 plays for 60 yards and four first downs.
By the time the final whistle was blown and the Trojans had secured a 31-17 victory, Tyler and junior tailback Curtis McNeal had combined for 185 yards on 37 carries.
But more importantly, they made it painfully obvious to the Irish that simply defending the pass wasn’t enough to secure a win.
A major point of contention toward Kiffin during his time here as coach has been his tendency to be one-dimensional on offense, relying on Barkley to move the ball through the air. This has worked against mediocre teams, but has stalled USC in major games when facing more-than-capable defenses.
But if recent games are any indication, a balance has slowly crept back into the Trojan offense, and has begun to open up the field.
I’m sure it wasn’t easy for Kiffin to trust his team to continue to pound the ball on the ground more times than in any other game this year. With the number of momentum-killing fumbles and the general lack of consistency he has seen in the run game during his one-and-a-half seasons, there weren’t a whole lot of on-field reminders that he was the coach of Tailback U.
Let’s not forget, either, that the backs he has called upon didn’t show much dependability coming into 2011, either, with Tyler missing most of fall camp and the first game because of alcohol-fueled infractions and McNeal missing all of last season because of academic ineligibility.
But in showing dedication to the run game, he allowed his two backs to show off their talent, and the mutual understanding has paid off.
Kiffin is no newcomer to the idea of using the run game to propel an offense. He was the offensive coordinator at USC during the Reggie Bush and LenDale White era — a time when running the ball wasn’t just a setup for the pass, but a dynamic offensive attack all by itself.
And though the current squad might not match up exactly with the 2005 team, there is no doubt that an effort has been made to rekindle some of the offensive rhythm that led to so much success during that time.
Despite all of the obstacles this team has dealt with recently, the pieces still remain for the offense to be productive — they just need to be used properly.
And, as all of us saw last Saturday, it starts with the run.

Yes, yes, the circumstances do seem similar. Far too many students will be running around South Los Angeles in Charlie Sheen costumes (it’s Halloween weekend). Lee Corso will also wear the headwear of the team he picks to win Saturday.
But the comparisons pretty much stop there. It’s 2011 and USC is clearly a better football team than it was 12 months ago.
To make an obvious point, the Trojans are 3-0 this month. Last year, USC entered the game against Oregon with a mere 1-2 mark in October.
The team has momentum this time around — there was no bye the week before. Things appear to be on the upswing.
In USC’s last two contests, it has outscored both California and Notre Dame by a combined score of 61-26. In each of those games, it looks as if USC coach Lane Kiffin has grown as a play caller and as a coach. Hey, the results speak for themselves.
But two things stand out most about this year’s group.
For one, junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s development has only continued. He might not exactly be Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, but he’s darn close. Through seven games, he has thrown for 2,006 yards with 19 touchdowns and four interceptions. His completion percentage also stands at 68 percent.
By comparison, Luck has actually thrown for fewer yards — 1,888 of them. He has, however, posted a touchdown-to-interception of 20:3 and a 72 percent completion percentage.
Secondly, USC’s defense is far better against the run than it was last season. Before Saturday night’s game against the Trojans, Notre Dame had been averaging 194 rushing yards per game, including 114 yards against Michigan State — the nation’s seventh best run defense. But the Irish finished with 41 yards on the ground and their season average dipped to 172 yards per game.
ESPN might opt to bill Saturday’s matchup simply as a Luck versus Barkley showdown, but it’s going to be won — to steal an old football cliché — in the trenches.
Stanford amassed 446 rushing yards last week against Washington. It ranks 17th nationally in rushing yards per game. But luckily for USC, its own defense is ranked 11th in rushing yards allowed per game. Something has to give, and for once, the breaks seem to be going USC’s way.
Don’t tell me the Trojans haven’t played anyone, either. Granted, their opponents are a combined 24-25 this season, but the Cardinal’s 65-21 win over then-No. 25 Washington was its first victory this season against a team with a winning record. And it came at home.
Last year’s Oregon team was ranked No. 1. It had defeated Tennessee in front of more than 100,000 fans in Knoxville, Tenn. It also beat Stanford by three touchdowns.
This season, the No. 4 Cardinal, because of a nonconference slate that included just San Jose State and Duke and a weak Pac-12, remains somewhat of an enigma more than halfway through the season.
Sure, Stanford is pretty good. Anyone will concede that. But so is USC, as testament to its more recent showings.
A season ago, the Trojans lost to Oregon by 21 points. But with the way they are playing thus far in 2011, it’d be wise not to change the channel come Saturday.
To steal a line from Corso, this one will be closer than the experts think.

It looks familiar, doesn’t it? Last season USC, then 5-2 overall, hosted No. 1 Oregon on Halloween weekend. ESPN’s College GameDay visited the Coliseum for the nationally televised primetime matchup.
In flight · When ESPN’s College GameDay visited USC last season, running back LaMichael James (above) and Oregon beat the Trojans at the Coliseum 53-32, handing the Trojans their third loss of the year. - Daily Trojan file photo
Similarly this season, USC (6-1) hosts another Pac-12 juggernaut in No. 4 Stanford. The Cardinal is also undefeated, as ESPN’s Emmy Award-winning college football pregame show descends upon Los Angeles.
The circumstances are certainly familiar for these Trojans. But will it be different this time? Will USC give us a treat and play as it has in the last two games or will it only trick us into thinking things have really changed this time around?
For many, USC’s resounding 31-17 victory over Notre Dame last Saturday in South Bend, Ind., signified a turning point in its season. Many dubbed the game USC coach Lane Kiffin’s signature win. Others believed the Trojans played their most complete game on both sides of the ball.
With the win, USC thrust itself into the national spotlight, jumping to No. 20 in the Associated Press top-25 poll. Despite the ranking, fans should be warned: It’s déjà vu all over again.
Yes, USC’s defense looked better against the Irish. It won the turnover battle three-to-zero and allowed just 226 passing yards and 41 rushing yards. But Notre Dame quarterback Tommy Rees isn’t typically mentioned in the same breath as Stanford signal caller Andrew Luck. Tailbacks Cierre Wood and Jonas Gray aren’t exactly Stanford’s Stepfan Taylor or Tyler Gaffney.
The Trojan defense has certainly had its moments, but it hasn’t been consistent. A 17-0 lead midway through the second quarter should have been safe, but it wasn’t. Junior safety Jawanza Starling’s fumble recovery was a 14-point swing. Had Notre Dame scored, the Irish would have had all the momentum and it’s a coin flip the rest of the way.
The Trojan defense has had its moments, but at times, it’s almost as if it’s 2010 again. A great offensive team like Stanford will capitalize on these weaknesses. Its offensive line has allowed just two sacks all season, which ranks first in the nation. Luck will have plenty of time to find his receivers and tight ends should USC not be able to pressure him. The Cardinal won’t turn the ball over in the red zone, it won’t make any unforced errors and it will score when given the opportunity.
The USC offense also seems to be hitting its stride, but its toughest test will be against Stanford. USC coach Lane Kiffin has raved about physical front sevens from Utah and Notre Dame, but Stanford’s rushing defense ranks second in the nation behind Alabama. Its scoring defense ranks fourth in the nation and 18th in total defense.
Another thing: Stanford has been nothing short of dominant this season and the second half of last season as it defeated its last 10 opponents by at least 25 points.
The Trojans have made improvements on both sides of the ball, but still have room to grow. Sure, the last two games have been encouraging and even nice for a change. Beating up on Notre Dame — something that has been almost expected now — is one thing, but hanging with a top-five team in the nation is completely different. Let’s not get too ahead of ourselves: USC football has certainly turned the corner, but it just doesn’t have that killer instinct or aura about it that all great teams possess. And this weekend’s matchup against Stanford will prove the true measuring stick.
Click here for a different viewpoint.
While all of this may be true, you left out an important fact. USC was toe to toe with Oregon through the third quarter last year. Yes, they weakened and lost by 21 points, but there are definite improvements between the 2010 and 2011 Trojan team.
Also, I seem to remember that we were thissssss close to beating Stanford last year. If we had played the same game with this Trojan defense (especially with Kalil’s ability to block field goals and extra points this season), I bet you we would have won that game. 
Granted, we need to do a lot of the same (and more) that we did against Notre Dame. There is no question that Stanford is a far better team. Barkley needs a similar game to the one he had against Arizona. Woods needs a similar game to the one he had against Minnesota. The defense needs to be aggressive and never let down. 
It’s a tall order. But do I have far more hope than I did last year? You bet.

With the recent release of the terrifying Paranormal Activity 3 and Halloween coming up next week, the supernatural is on the mind.
Many get sucked into this ominous other realm, believing in those brief few hours at the theater that the dead can come back to haunt us. Though this horror might not persist or translate beyond the screen or the holiday, the thought of the paranormal world lingers in the back of our minds, even if we’re too afraid to admit it. Many hold onto their skepticism on a superficial level — until they’ve encountered psychic Betsy Balega, whose newest book Being Mystic: In Touch With Godtackles just that.

“I’ve heard them all,” Balega said. “But trust me, their minds are changed soon after meeting me.”
Balega is not your run-of-the-mill, carnival psychic. She does not wear a turban and she doesn’t need a crystal ball.
Instead, Balega is a world-renowned medium — one who can communicate with the dead — who has helped countless homicide and missing person investigations and hosts a popular radio show in Canada, where she currently resides.
When she enters her Toronto home, Balega might see a few spirits roaming around. We’re not talking about the horrifying demons that stalk Katie and Kristi in the latest Paranormal flick. Instead, they simply visit her at her usual table in her neighborhood coffee shop.
It’s become second nature to Balega.
In fact, when spirits first started to appear to her around the age of four, Balega didn’t realize that anything was wrong.
“I thought it was normal, like breathing,” Balega said with a laugh.
As she grew up, she soon realized seeing spirits was not normal but was instead a very special gift.
“In my early 20s, I met with a medium named Mary Polis who taught me how to harness and focus my power,” Balega said.
Balega was nervous, however, to tell others of her talents. During this time, Balega worked in medicine and hid her gift from her coworkers, who she thought would frown upon it.
Balega eventually realized that her powers were given to her for a reason.
“I was put here to help people,” Balega said.
For Balega, spirits form “almost like a sparkler.” A flash of light materializes and the spirit begins to form from the head down, appearing as a guide to lead her to answers her clients are looking for.
These spirits are stuck in a fourth dimension and are desperate to tell their family and friends their secrets, hopes and wishes. Others are angels and demons.
These are forces that clearly cannot be ignored.
“When spirits talk, I listen,” Balega said. “They don’t have an agenda; they don’t lie.”
One of Balega’s most immediate spirits is her deceased mother, for whom Balega is especially thankful, as she often guides her through life decisions with unabashed honesty.
“My mom never lied when she was alive,” Balega said. “She’s certainly not going to while she’s dead.”
Balega discusses these matters in Being Mystic: In Touch With God.
The first three words are some many are familiar with: “In the beginning.”
Balega is obviously a spiritual being, but she also believes listening to the Bible is just as important as listening to psychics.
When she used to live in an old Baptist church, Balega encountered some demons.
“One day I walked into my kitchen and saw these two black demons, with red eyes fighting almost like how they do in the cartoons,” Balega said.
Frightened beyond belief, Balega remembered something she had done that day.
“I realized I had moved a cross from my kitchen earlier that day,” Balega said. “I ran and put the cross back in the kitchen and said, ‘I’m sorry for moving you!’”
Instances such as these push Balega to respect the spirits, and to be aware of their capacity for evil.
What might sound like a bunch of hogwash to some might be a source of salvation for others. Those who have lost a family member or friend cherish a moment when they think they are communicating with them.
Regardless of whether you believe in this supernatural world, this Halloween is as good a time as any to explore the paranormal.
Being Mystic is currently available in bookstores for a chilling, haunting read.

The horror movie genre, while supremely varied, is limited in scope — there are only so many conventions a film can contain without meandering into the distracting.
Haunting perspective · Paranormal Activity 3 follows the harrowing tale of sisters Katie (Chloe Csengery, left) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown). - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures
Paranormal Activity 3 pushes these limits, playing host to a wide assortment of horror concepts and mythologies. Poltergeists? Creepy children? Communicative demons? The occult? Check, check and double check. This movie has it all, though none of it’s new.
It’s a wonder, then, that directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman have managed to craft a compelling, focused piece out of a buffet of influences and classic horror clichés.
Paranormal Activity 3 builds on the minimalist premise that propelled the first film in the series to acclaim in 2007, this time looking at the childhoods of Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), two sisters whose adult lives were detailed in the first two films.
As with Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, the main plot is basic enough: Things in the house go from normal to not-so-normal and then to holy-hell-we’re-going-to-die mode, with a frustrating search for explanation tied in. Everything is shot from a distinct point of view — be it a hand-held camera or omniscient perspective — and editing is hidden under a fictitious veil of home video spontaneity.
In that sense, the third movie doesn’t bring much new to the table. You’re not going to be blown away by concept creativity here, and the style and pacing of the franchise make it easy to recognize when the scares are coming, making the result not much of a surprise.
But here’s the thing: Joost and Schulman know this. Instead of letting predictability hinder the film, they’ve used it to their advantage.
Like a rollercoaster slowly clunking toward the apex of a massive drop, Paranormal Activity 3 brazenly taunts your psyche. It gambles, betting that even if you know what’s coming, you’ll be overwhelmed by what actually occurs. To top it all off, the film swiftly ramps up the intensity of the paranormal incidents themselves in a way not seen in the first two films.
This is not subtlety at play here. This is successful shock and awe.
Though the premise might not be anything new, Joost and Schulman reach into the bag of tricks to milk all the terror they can out of it.
It’s the kind of cleverness demonstrated by what might be the best — and most aggravatingly scary — use of a standing floor fan in film to date. Hijacked by stepdad Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) to act as an auto-panning platform for his camera, this rotating, whirring horror is a thrilling success. The view of the camera continuously swiveling from kitchen to living room is maddening, simultaneously hiding and revealing details during already eyelid-twitching stretches of quiet suspense.
Joost and Schulman’s attention to detail is part of what makes Paranormal Activity 3 so fresh. The film could have derailed itself in several instances, including its cheeky references to the horror genre (a hissing, static-filled television being one obvious example) and its hodge-podge thematic mixture of ghosts, possession and cult-like demon worship. But the filmmakers hold steady, focusing on the true guiding purpose of the movie: to scare you by any and all means possible.
The final act of the film takes fright to unforeseen new heights. Be warned: Paranormal Activity 3 is not suited for the faint of heart. It even sent one young woman nervously half-jogging out of her seat at the climax of the movie (“I can’t stand it!” she wailed out of reflex, quickly cupping her mouth.)
It’s all helped by the cast’s surprisingly seamless performances. No one sticks out, and relationships just seem surprisingly natural, particularly between Dennis and the girls’ mother, Julie (Lauren Bittner). Where is this sort of acting in Hollywood’s big-budget films?
Like the original Paranormal Activity, the dialogue, at some points, seems improvised; however, writer Christopher B. Landon must also be given credit for his beautifully transparent script.
Perhaps Paranormal Activity 3 won’t win any awards for originality. So what? It’s still the scariest film of the year so far, with only a few legitimate challengers looming ahead.
Paranormal Activity 3 proves, if anything, execution still trumps a flashy concept. What’s important is that the film giddily delivers on its promise of fright. For that accomplishment alone, it’s worth a watch.

Drinking in college is a reality. Whether or not you choose to drink, alcohol pervades college campuses: tailgates, parties, 21st birthdays and other events can all get boozy.
Alcohol is not just a social tool for college students; it can also have lasting effects on our bodies. Many fitness enthusiasts and body builders argue you shouldn’t touch alcohol at all.
I disagree. Sure, alcohol can increase body fat because of its sugars, but in regard to physical performance and strength training, alcohol isn’t the problem. Alcohol doesn’t have noticeable shortcomings when it comes to exercise, and really, if you’re keeping up with a strong fitness routine, you shouldn’t have to worry about enjoying a drink. Alcohol alone isn’t going to destroy your body.
Body builders and those trying to improve strength avoid alcohol to keep the body at its peak muscle building stage. Their argument postulates that alcohol reduces the body’s testosterone, which is essential to building muscle. By drastically altering the production of hormones, growth is thrown off its natural progression.
Except, this isn’t really what happens to the body. Though alcohol can cut testosterone production by almost a quarter, it’s only for less than a day and only if you binge drink. A number of studies point out that drinking soon after a muscle-training exercise produced only nominal testosterone loss.
Similarly, those opposed to drinking bring up a number of obstacles that are preventable if you know what you’re doing. These advocates say alcohol dehydrates the body and diminishes the vitamins and minerals key to growing muscles. This is true physiologically, but these effects can be avoided: Take vitamins as a way to combat the effects of alcohol. Or, as most people working on building muscle should already be doing, drink copious amounts of water throughout the day and before bed to stay hydrated.
Of course, the biggest argument against drinking is that it disrupts muscle recovery by throwing off sleep patterns. For all the nutrients you pack into the body and the weights you lift, your body still needs rest, as muscles grow the most during sleep.
But, sleep patterns for college students aren’t the best to begin with. Rest is important, but the argument against drinking seems more tied to a decrease in nutrients, which can be easily solved with extra water and vitamins.
Others might wonder about muscle strength.
If alcohol doesn’t dramatically hurt mass accumulation, does it still risk affecting how powerful the muscles are? Remember, size does not equal strength. Look at Bruce Lee, for instance. Some studies have found decreased power and coordination in alcoholics, but only in that group. For those who are not substance abusers, there’s no sign alcohol makes the body weaker, even while drinking.
There are some claims that drinking can leave the body sluggish and the cardiovascular system strained, but this is more tied to nutrient deprivation as opposed to drinking, as moderate alcohol consumption can actually boost cardiovascular health. So a little drinking — just not before exercise — can actually help the body perform better. Alcohol doesn’t weaken muscles and it doesn’t seem to stall strength gain either. Like mass gains, if there are any negative effects from alcohol, they are more treatable symptoms than serious obstacles.
Of course, everyone knows heavy drinking isn’t a good thing. Sure, it doesn’t drastically affect physical fitness, but that doesn’t mean you should down a six-pack of beer after finishing 10 sets of bench presses. What this does mean is if you’re working on creating a diet regimen designed to maximize strength building, then you don’t have to rule out all alcohols.
And exercise, particularly strength training exercises, can actually help the body deal with alcohol. Stimulating the muscles releases endorphins and gets the blood flowing, which helps muscles recover from any of the physical effects of drinking. The two might not be a perfect match, but they are not completely incompatible either — and for some college students, this is good news.
So, don’t panic over alcohol. If you do drink from time to time and are working on growing stronger, you should be fine as long as your diet and workout plan are sound. Enjoy a nice drink.

Alcohol affects people differently. Some people after a night of drinking can sleep the day away but other people wake up early after a night of drinking. If you want to know why your body does this, this article gives a great explanation on it.

At a preview screening of Allen Gregory on Oct. 23 at Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre, cast and production members were on hand to answer questions about scriptwriting, the inspiration for the show and exactly how graphic an animated 7-year-old’s fantasies about his elderly principal can get before a network will refuse to air a show.
“They’ve put some pretty subversive stuff on Fox before,” creator and voice actor Jonah Hill said. “So we figured that was the place for us. But it’s not just about what we can get away with. We drew a lot [from shows like] The Simpsons, which are outstanding comedy, but also have a tremendous amount of heart.”
Hill, along with co-creators Andrew Mogel and Jarrad Paul, have been working on the show since its inception more than two years ago. At that time, Paul and Mogel had written the script for Himelfarb, in which Hill was set to play a deluded man in an imaginary relationship. The movie never materialized, but some of the writing lingered.
“Jonah was just so good at the part,” Paul said. “We wanted to keep that quality. And Jonah grew up watching The Simpsons, like anyone his age, and when he wanted to do an animated show, we knew we had this idea.”
Thus, the character of Allen Gregory, a self-proclaimed protégé at apparently every skill set and social grace, was born. Allen is accustomed only to the comforts of the home he shares with his father, Richard (a wickedly flamboyant French Stewart), a man of appalling manners and dubious financial success. Rounding out the family are Allen’s adopted sister Julie (Joy Osmanski), who Allen hates for having the gall to enter his life from “the desert or the sea or wherever,” and his father’s life partner Jeremy (Nat Faxon), a formerly straight, well-meaning doormat. The pint-sized protagonist is, for the first time, braving those his own age.
After a disastrous first day at public elementary school, the comically diminutive Allen climbs a stepstool up to his father’s bed and reveals the true premise for both his character and the show in a surprisingly touching moment of weakness:
“Do you think the kids at school will like me?” he asks.
Goodman, who served as the head writer for more than 100 Family Guy episodes, was confident in the ways Allen Gregory diverges from its animated contemporaries.
“It does help that Family Guy gets away with way worse,” Goodman said with a quick laugh. “But with [Family Guy character] Stewie, you’re always like, ‘Is he serious? Is he joking? Is he gay?’ This is more grounded and, stylistically speaking, very new. It’s not flat-looking like other shows; it looks more like a movie. No one, at least no one with Fox, has ever attempted this before.”
Hill happily dished out advice for aspiring writers (“Since you’re students, I might as well”), crediting Judd Apatow with telling him never to lend any weight to a show’s lifespan. Whether a series is promptly canceled or runs for a decade, Hill noted the important thing was to make sure whatever actually aired looked the way creators intended it to look.
Production for the first season of Allen Gregory, consisting of seven half-hour episodes, has already wrapped. When asked what it would take to get a second season confirmed, most cast members said they really had no idea, but were quick to encourage students to promote the show on Twitter and Facebook to boost ratings.
“It’s so different,” Mogel said. “People are either going to embrace it or they’re not. But we’re all pretty optimistic, because, I mean … it’s just funny.”
Allen Gregory premieres Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET on Fox.

This registration period USC students are seeing a new face of Web Registration. Noticeably more colorful, with larger text and more convenient menus, Web Registration for spring 2012 appears far more user-friendly than Web Registration of semesters past.
It is commendable that USC is making efforts to improve the usability and appearance of its individual websites. Many key issues, however, remain with USC web-space as a whole. Just as USC seeks to create an active, well-connected student body, USC should seek to create an active, well-connected network of websites for its student body, faculty, alumni and other users.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
USC’s network of websites is far from unified. Though it is beneficial that many different areas of USC have websites with unique design elements, these individual websites should present a logical flow of hyperlinks so students can quickly reach the information they are looking for.
Oftentimes, relevant pages are not easily discoverable via hyperlinks. When looking up information about USC majors under the undergraduate admissions section, for example, students are linked to the USC course catalogue. Hyperlinks, however, are not clearly available to reach additional information on other official USC sites, such as descriptions of majors and minors in USC’s different colleges. Students can reach valuable information about specific majors on the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences website, but the course catalogue website does not link these pages for each respective major.
In this case, USC’s network of websites offers the information students would need about specific majors, including who to contact for additional questions. This information, however, is not presented in the same place, or within a click-able distance.
Students are required to take unnecessarily complicated measures to get desired information from the web. It would be beneficial for students if USC optimized the linking among its various websites to ensure students are informed by the most relevant, correct information the university has to offer regarding its various programs and functions.
USC also requires students to make many different log-ins, oftentimes for very specific purposes. An incoming freshman, for example, in addition to having to register for a USC email will likely have to create separate accounts for numerous other functions.
Consider a freshman majoring in biological sciences, taking Introductory Chemistry, Introductory Biology, a G.E., and a class to clear a foreign language requirement. He will likely have to create separate accounts for at least the following functions: financial aid, Blackboard, Mastering chemistry/physics/etc. and a chemistry lab, not to mention other registrations that become necessary as this student becomes increasingly involved on campus.
Unifying the log-in procedures for such diverse websites is a difficult task, especially at such a large university. It is not so difficult, however, to maintain updated portal websites with easy access. USC should make additional efforts to make its own websites more navigable, not just as individual pages but in relation to each other.
Clear efforts have been made to unify accounts for students’ experiences. For example, the myUSC portal site allows students to quickly access many commonly used services. The Student Involvement Transcript further consolidates students’ campus involvement information. But availability of information alone should not be a sufficient goal for a high-end university. USC web space should continue to evolve not just to look prettier but also to function more smoothly.
Naturally, form follows function, and a beautifully functional USC will reflect itself in a beautifully formed website. Whether in cyberspace, campus space or some other place, USC should maintain efforts focused on optimizing functionality.

Libyan Col. Moammar Gaddafi’s 42-year brutal reign is over, but the future looks murky for a country primarily known for exporting oil and terrorism.
Though there is much celebration for the Libyans, who have been waiting more than 40 years for justice, but freedom in Libya is far from secure.
Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, president of Libya’s National Transitional Council and the interim leader of the Libyan government, told a massive crowd gathered in Benghazi their sacrifices in the drive to depose Gaddafi had not been in vain.
As his speech came to an end, bursts of gunfire erupted in Benghazi and in the capital ,Tripoli. Men, women and children chanted in support of the revolution and waved hundreds of the red, black and green flags. The reality of events to come, however, is far from the excitement in response to Gaddafi’s death. There are sure to be a number of foreign interests gathering to stake their claim in a post-Gaddafi Libya.
Now that the fighting is apparently over, the issue of Libya’s oil production will swiftly move front and center in international interests.
One thing is certain: International oil companies will be packing into flights to Tripoli to cut deals for a piece of largest proven oil reserves in Africa with 42 billion barrels of oil and more than 1.3 trillion cubic meters of natural gas.
The future composition of Libya’s post-Gaddafi government could also prove a point of controversy and political strife. Last month Abdul Jalil, who is also the country’s leader, told his audience in his first public appearance in Tripoli, “We seek a state of law, prosperity and one where Sharia is the main source for legislation, and this requires many things and conditions.”
The legacy of Gaddafi’s repressive regime already seems everlasting, and with further combined complications as a result of Gaddafi’s death, it regrettably seems as if dark times lie ahead for Libya.

Production cost for Paranormal Activity 3 might have run just $5 million, but its debut this weekend exceeded expectations and opened to a staggering $54 million. This third installment of candid-and-creepy-camera features serves as the prequel to the first two Paranormal Activity movies about a demonic force that haunts a pair of sisters.
It is the most successful October movie debut ever, beating last year’s Jackass 3-D, which opened at $50.4. It is also the best opening since the $54.8 million August opening of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. According to CNN, Paramount is claiming Paranormal Activity 3 is the best horror opening of all time, topping the 40.7 debut of Paranormal Activity 2.
However, CinemaScore graders rated the film a poor “C+” in comparison to Paranormal Activity 2’s “B” rating. PA2 also drew a younger audience, with 60 percent under the age of 25. PA3 continued to attract younger moviegoers, but it dropped to 53 percent that were under the age of 25. Considering that next week is Halloween weekend, Paramount does not expect ratings to drop.
The studio’s vice-chairman, Rob Moore, told the Hollywood Reporter “there’s no ‘Paranormal Activity 4’ currently in development, but that ‘people certainly continue to be very interested in the franchise.’ ”
 
1. Paranormal Activity 3 — $54.0 mil
2. Real Steel — $11.3 mil
3. Footloose — $10.9 mil
4. The Three Musketeers — $8.8 mil
5. The Ides of March — $4.9 mil

Playing with just four players for the first time since 2002, the No. 10 USC women’s golf team ended its fall campaign on a strong note, finishing tied for fourth at the SEC/Pac-12 Challenge in Knoxville, Tenn. The tournament marked the best finish so far this year for the Women of Troy, who won an impressive four tournaments last season.
USC concluded play with an overall score of 16-over 880, tied for fourth with Tennessee. Alabama won the 23-team tournament with a score of 1-over 865, followed by UCLA at 5-over 869 and Auburn at 15-over 879.
USC was already undermanned when play started Friday, as sophomore Sophia Popov injured her wrist in last week’s Stanford Intercollegiate tournament and did not fly with the team to Knoxville. Because of this, combined with the quick turnaround from last week, the Women of Troy fielded just  four players, even though teams are allowed to use five players and potentially drop their lowest individual score. It was the first time since the 2002 NCAA Regionals that the USC women’s team participated in a tournament with only four players.
The Women of Troy jumped up to fourth place Sunday, finishing at 16-over 880. Freshman Kristen Park recorded an impressive 4-under 68 on the final 18 holes, finishing tied for seventh at 1-over 217. McCloskey also finished seventh, shooting a 1-under 71. Inah Park finished the final round with a score of 2-over 74 and concluded the tournament tied for 20th at 3-over 219. Morris rebounded from her tough second round to shoot 2-over 74, coming in tied for 59th at 11-over 227.
The second round saw considerable individual improvement from the Women of Troy, who came in at 7-over 295. Inah Park shot an even-72 to finish play Saturday tied for 13th at 1-over 145, while McCloskey also carded even to conclude two rounds tied for 20th at 2-over 146. Kristen Park shot a 1-over 73 to hit 5-over 149, while Morris struggled to a 6-over 78 for a two-round total of 9-over 153.
The Women of Troy got off to a competitive start, finishing play Friday tied for ninth at 10-over 298. Senior Inah Park led all USC golfers with a first-round score of 1-over 73. After falling to 3-over after 12 holes, Park bounced back to finish 2-over through the final six, finishing tied for 23rd place. Senior Lisa McCloskey recorded a birdie and three bogeys en route to a score of 2-over 74, finishing tied for 32nd. Sophomore Rachel Morris struggled to a 4-over through the first six holes but regrouped to finish tied for 46th at 3-over 75. Freshman Kristen Park, who played as an individual last week, finished tied for 55th at 4-over 76.
“Our fab four have something in which they can be very proud,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “It was a big-time field, so this was a darn good performance to have low round of the day. It was a difficult and long course that required a lot of patience on the greens.”
The Women of Troy will be off until February, when they begin the spring season with the 2012 Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif.

The set up: After eight consecutive years of defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, the USC Trojans experienced defeat last season in Los Angeles. Notre Dame hoped to use that victory as a springboard into an extended period of dominance over its intersectional rival. USC, coming off a long week after defeating California on Oct. 13 in San Francisco, and Notre Dame, coming off a bye week, met under the lights in the first night game in South Bend since 1990.
The story: After a year in South Bend, Ind., the Jeweled Shillelagh returns to Los Angeles. The USC Trojans, 6-1 (3-1), soundly defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (4-3) by a score of 31-17 after some tense moments.
After losing last season on a last-second play, the Trojans have now won nine of the last ten meetings against the Fighting Irish.
Redshirt senior running back Curtis McNeal led an invigorated rushing attack as he ran 24 times for 118 yards. Overall, the Trojans rushed 44 times for 219 yards — its highest single-game rushing total of the season.
Not only did the running game vastly improve, the Trojan defense forced three turnovers and shut down the Notre Dame rushing game — 41 yards on 14 attempts — as well as senior wide receiver Michael Floyd. Floyd, who had four catches and 28 yards, was eighth in catches and 15th in yards nationally entering Saturday.
The USC offense was firing on all cylinders, as junior quarterback Matt Barkley completed 24 passes on 35 attempts and compiled a three-touchdown, zero-interception, 224-yard performance.
Sophomore wideout Robert Woods had a 12-catch performance as well as 119 yards and a score.
USC’s first drive of the game featured 13 plays, 11 of which were run plays. Barkley found an open redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer to cap off a 66-yard drive that lasted 7:39.
On the ensuing Notre Dame drive, the Irish failed to record a first down, starting the game with two drives that went three-and-out.
On the next Trojan drive, Barkley quickly moved the chains, leading the team down the field 62 yards in six plays for a Woods three-yard touchdown reception.
USC and Notre Dame failed to score points in the second quarter until USC’s freshman kicker Andre Heidari kicked a 25-yard field goal.
On the following kickoff, freshman running back George Atkinson III returned the ball 96 yards for the Irish’s first points of the game with 3:22 left in the first half. The return invigorated a Notre Dame crowd that fell silent after its team fell behind by 17.
At the end of the first half and into the beginning of the second, Notre Dame’s offense was cutting through the Trojans’ defense quite easily. Notre Dame drove 19 plays and 88 yards to the Trojans 1 yard-line when backup quarterback senior Dayne Crist, received a poor snap and fumbled the ball. The ball was squirted backwards, and it was loose until junior safety Jawanza Starling picked it up at the Irish 20 and returned it for a touchdown. After that, it was smooth sailing toward USC’s sixth victory.
Notre Dame scored in the beginning of the fourth quarter by way of a 25-yard Jonas Gray run, but USC responded two possessions later with Woods’ second touchdown of the day, this time a 14-yard diving catch in the back right corner. The final score stayed at 31-17.
The turnover battle: Though the Irish turned the ball over three times, by way of a fumbled snap, and interception, and a failed backwards pass, the Trojans did not once. USC converted the first two turnovers in to touchdowns and ran out the clock after forcing an interception late in the game.
Up next: USC plays host to the No. 4  Stanford Cardinal at the Coliseum Saturday at 5:00 p.m. (PDT). Stanford is coming off a dominating 65-21 victory over then no. 25 ranked Washington. Last season, Stanford beat USC, 37-35. The Cardinal have won ten straight games by at least 25 points.  ESPN’s College GameDay will be taping Saturday morning from outside the peristyle end of the Coliseum.
