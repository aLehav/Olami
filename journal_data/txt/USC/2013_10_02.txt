The USC baseball program announced its 2014 schedule this week.

The 53-game slate starts on Feb. 14, when the Trojans will host Northwestern in a weekend set.
Unlike in years past, when the Trojans have made at least one major nonconference road trip, USC will not leave Los Angeles until they start Pac-12 play at Oregon on March 14. Just three of their first 16 contests will occur outside the confines of Dedeaux Field, one of those being the annual Dodgertown Classic, which is scheduled to return after a year’s hiatus against defending national champion UCLA at Dodger Stadium.
“We are excited about our schedule, which we think is extremely challenging,” USC coach Dan Hubbs said in a statement.
USC will play 18 games against teams that made the postseason last year, something that Hubbs has hinted at being a legitimate goal for the Trojans this season. USC hasn’t played in a regional competition since 2005.
Though the Trojans do not have a strong nonconference weekend test, their midweek games look as tough as ever. Two games against 2013 Super Regional host Cal State Fullerton highlight the slate. USC went 0-3 against the perennial powerhouse Fullerton Titans last year.
But after opening the season with so many home games, the Trojans will hit the road for much of March. Starting with the March 9 contest with the Bruins at Dodger Stadium, USC plays just two of its next 10 matchups at home. Back-to-back conference road trips to Oregon and Stanford to open Pac-12 play make for a rough start for a team that went 10-20 in conference play last year.
“Our hope is that we can get off to a strong start with an early home schedule before we get into conference play,” Hubbs said.
Even with the mid-March road series, USC will still play 32 home games compared to just 20 on the road, plus the neutral-site game at Dodger Stadium to round out their 53-game set.

The best movie ever is Remember the Titans. This is an indisputable fact and I will not waste another millimeter of column space discussing it. There is a great scene in the movie where coach Herman Boone (played by the one and only Denzel Washington) is meeting his team for the first time. Coach Boone asks his running back why he is smiling. The player responds, “Because football is fun.” Boone then intimidates the player to the point that he changes his mind, and says football is “Zero fun, sir.”
That’s sort of how I’ve felt about the USC football team, especially the last two years. Now, I don’t think former coach Lane Kiffin (that’s still strange to say) intimidated his players — quite the opposite, in fact. But I do believe he created a culture where football was indeed “zero fun.” Or at least close to it.
When Athletic Director Pat Haden introduced Ed Orgeron as the interim head coach on Sunday, the two men used the word “fun” at least six times (by my count) in their 20-or-so minutes at the podium. I doubt I would need two hands to count how many times I heard Kiffin say “fun” in almost four years here.
“This is a game of fun and joy,” Haden said Sunday. “And one of the things we’re looking for is for Ed [Orgeron] to bring that fun and joy back into the game of college football.”
Haden’s choice of Orgeron as interim head coach was calculated, obviously, but calculated in part specifically for this purpose. He is, in many ways, the polar opposite of Kiffin.
Orgeron is dynamic and engaging with the media. Kiffin was reserved and often appeared bored. Orgeron yells, and yells a lot. When his players mess up, they get quite the earful. Kiffin was rarely animated with anyone besides referees. Someone joked that Orgeron wouldn’t even need to re-open practices to the media because we would be able to hear him from outside of the fence well enough. The media often had to ask Kiffin to speak up, because you still couldn’t hear him even when the microphone was inches from his face.
“I’m gonna have some energy and excitement,” Orgeron said when asked about his sideline demeanor. “High-fiving guys, having fun. All the things I love to do.”
This is, of course, in stark contrast to Kiffin, who generally stood 20 yards upfield from the action, head buried in his laminated playsheet. Of course, as the offensive playcaller this is only natural: it’s a better view of the game. But Kiffin was the head coach too, and you just never got that feeling during games. It was like sometimes he forgot that there was an actual competition taking place right in front of him because he was too engrossed in his playbook to notice.
Much fun has been made about Kiffin’s official USC bio, which claims that he was “known for his high football IQ, as well as for being a master playcaller,” given USC’s recent offensive ineptitude. But I don’t actually think that claim is false. Kiffin does have a tremendous coaching mind, and I believe he would still make a fairly good offensive coordinator. But the fact is, some people just aren’t cut out to be head coaches.
When you have a moment, look up “Pete Carroll USC practice,” or something like that, on YouTube. What do you see? Will Ferrell, April Fools jokes, singing — hell, he’s literally playing the piano in one of them. If you really want to see something, check out “USC Trojans Slip’N Slide at practice” on YouTube. That’s an offensive and a defensive assistant coach having a Slip’N Slide competition to settle that day’s winner of practice.
I understand that Uncle Pete was an anomaly, and I’m not saying that Kiffin should have learned to play the piano. But I think the most excited I’ve ever seen a USC player at a Lane Kiffin practice was former offensive lineman Matt Kalil running around after a practice and shouting about the “ice cream and cookies” the offense had just earned in the hotel that night. And that was one time. USC football practices under Kiffin were indescribably lifeless.
And that translated to the games. Think of the Trojan sideline as things began to unravel in the third quarter at Arizona State last Saturday. There was no sense of fight or drive — just a sort of resignation. And I don’t think I even need to talk about the Sun Bowl.
It’s safe to say that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will have a fresh feeling to it in a week when USC hosts Arizona. That goes for both fans and players.
“I want our guys to believe and have a little fun,” Orgeron said in his introductory press conference. “Have some fun for these next eight games and let the chips fall where they may.”
For those in the Coliseum, it just might be fun to be at a USC football game again. And I’m not only talking about the fans.
 
“Any Given Saturday” runs on Thursdays, ironically. To explain to Nick how this makes no sense, or comment on this column, email him at burtonn@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
 
Thank God! USC Trojan football is back. Our Trojans will be better than before and we may surprise some teams. At least we will fight to the end. I do not think that we will see 62 points scored on us again under coach O.
Fight On!

The USC offense has undergone a dramatic transformation since the Trojans took the field against Arizona State last weekend.

When junior wide receiver Marqise Lee crumpled to the ground with a left knee injury last weekend against the Sun Devils, the Trojans lost their most prolific playmaker.
And when it was announced hours after the game that former head coach Lane Kiffin had been fired, USC cut loose its offensive playcaller for the last three and a half seasons.
Kiffin is gone for good. And even though Lee’s injury doesn’t seem to be as bad as was originally feared, as tests revealed no ligament damage, he’s been gimping around campus this week on crutches. And on Wednesday, USC Athletics posted on Twitter that “[Interim head coach Ed] Orgeron is hoping for a miraculous recovery to have [Lee] ready for Arizona.” So his return doesn’t appear to be imminent, despite the squad’s optimism.
Freshman Darreus Rogers and redshirt senior De’Von Fluornoy are both nursing ankle sprains, further weakening the group of wideouts. Therefore, under offensive coordinator Clay Helton, who will actually have to live up to his title now as the unit’s playcaller, USC will seemingly have to rely on some deep backups for at least a week or two — which could become a major concern considering the team’s lack of depth.
“Thank God it’s a bye week,” Helton said. “Hopefully we get a couple guys back, and we’ll see where we are next week.”
The team will likely count on sophomore Nelson Agholor to lead the depleted receiving corps. Agholor entered the season as a breakout candidate after recording 233 receiving yards and two touchdowns in USC’s final three games last season. But so far he’s struggled to make much of an impact, catching 11 passes and averaging just 38.4 yards through five games.
“I’m just worried about getting wins,” Agholor said. “All I can do is continue to get better.”
The role of redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell is also expected to expand. Last year, Blackwell’s chances to prove himself were few and far between, as he caught just one pass.
But after Lee exited Saturday’s game, Blackwell replaced him in the starting lineup and notched his first two catches of the season, the second of which came on a crucial fourth-down play in the final quarter to keep USC’s faint hopes alive.
Blackwell lined up as the Trojans’ second starting wideout opposite Agholor throughout practice on Wednesday and had his number called on the first play of 11-on-11 drills, reeling in a 10-yard reception.
“I was really proud of Victor Blackwell coming in and doing the most with his opportunity,” Helton said. “We talked about that as an offense — you never know when you’ll get your opportunity.”
That statement is especially true for redshirt freshman Robby Kolanz, a walk-on who estimates he got about 15-20 snaps against the Sun Devils as his first taste of playing time for the Trojans after they were reduced to only two healthy scholarship wideouts.
“Being out there in front of the student section at Arizona State, just kinda looking around and seeing what I’m doing, I just had to pinch myself and lock in,” Kolanz said. “Once you get out there for a few plays, the game starts to slow down and it gets a lot better.”
It’s unclear how Kolanz will fit into Helton’s plans for the offense, if he does at all. But in his last post-game press conference, Kiffin said that the team would probably use Kolanz in three-wide sets if Lee was injured for an extended period of time.
It’s quite stunning that with the litany of talented receivers USC possesses, they might be forced to give significant playing time to walk-ons. But the Trojans are looking at it positively, as every player now has a chance to prove themselves.
“What [Orgeron] told us today was to prepare, because you don’t know who’s next,” Agholor said. “A lot of guys are gonna get great opportunities to do things with the ball and to make plays out there.”

Wednesday marked many firsts for the Trojans: the first day of practice after a deflating loss to Arizona State, the first practice without Lane Kiffin and the first practice with Ed Orgeron as the interim head coach.

Players learned via text message early Sunday morning that Lane Kiffin had been dismissed as the head coach of the Trojans, making way for a new era.
Clay Helton will assume Kiffin’s former position as the new offensive coordinator with the responsibility of playcalling. With eight games left to turn things around, the Trojans are still confident that they can have a successful season. This week is a bye week, so the players will enjoy a “well-deserved rest,” Orgeron said.
Practice was filled with high intensity, competition and … fun? Fun is a word that the Trojans have not used in a while to describe practice. But Orgeron stressed injecting some excitement back into the squad during his introductory press conference, and today’s practice started with some lively one-on-one competition between linemen followed by plenty more offense versus defense action.
NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN
Orgeron has his plate full as the man in charge of getting the Trojans back on track. He says that he has gone through similar adverse circumstances before and is ready for what’s to come.
Orgeron served as the head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels for three seasons from 2005-07. He also has had extensive experience as a defensive line coach both in college football and the NFL.
“This is my shot, it’s our shot as a team,” Orgeron said. “I didn’t know if I’d ever become a head coach again and I’m going to give it my best.”
Though this will be the first time in six years that he assumes the role, Orgeron says that he has learned from some of the best head coaches of all time. Orgeron served as a defensive coordinator under Pete Carroll, former USC head coach, from 1998 to 2004.
Orgeron is already integrating some of Carroll’s style back into the program. His first order of business: opening practice back up to media. He greeted every member of the media on the sidelines at the start of practice with an endearing handshake.
“I missed y’all,” Orgeron said. “This is part of what Coach Carroll built with us — the energy, excitement, good and the bad. Hey, we are what we are and we want you to come see us.”
Orgeron as the head coach is a new beginning for the Trojans in more ways than one. His style of coaching and personality are both different from what the players have been accustomed to under the Kiffin regime. His voice is something you cannot tune out.
“It fires me up,” said redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler. “I’d rather someone yell at me and get on me for little mistakes than let it go.”
Kessler will not have to worry about that, since Orgeron was quite comfortable getting on the offense during practice.
“I love it,” Orgeron said, laughing. “I love being able to get in the offense and get in the offensive lines’ butt and scream at the quarterback.”
Farewell to Kiffin
Kiffin was released from the Trojans after a tumultuous three-plus years as head coach. In that time, the Trojans went 28-15 in the last 11 games he coached and ended with four wins and seven losses.
Though Kiffin caught heat for his playcalling and questionable behavior both on the sidelines and off the field, players and coaches alike had nothing but positive things to say about him.
Kessler said he will never forget the comfort he felt from Kiffin and his family after the dreadful Washington State loss earlier this season.
“I was sitting in the locker room extremely upset that we lost, and Layla [Kiffin’s wife] came in there and started cheering me up,” Kessler said. “She let me know that they support me regardless.”
Kessler and his teammates said they were in shock that he was dismissed just five games into the season, but the team is not looking back as they prepare for the rest of the season.
“He busted his tail for USC everyday,” Orgeron said. “I have the utmost respect for him, but we have to move on and I know he’d want us to do the same.”
Injury Updates
Injuries and depth, two major interrelated problems, have affected the Trojans this season.
The receiving corps is down to the last two healthy wideouts, sophomore Nelson Agholor and redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell. In the Trojans’ last game against the Sun Devils, junior receiver Marqise Lee left the game with what looked like a serious knee injury. It was confirmed on Wednesday that he has a severe knee sprain.
“Marqise makes some miraculous recoveries, but we’re going to work hard to get him ready for next week,” said Orgeron.
With the possibility of Lee being out for next Thursday’s game against the Wildcats, the Trojans’ offense will have their work cut out for them.
Some good news for the offense is that senior tailback Silas Redd is confident that he will play against Arizona.
“Yes, yes I am healthy,” Redd said when asked if he felt 100 percent recovered from his nagging knee injury.
Redd’s presence might be needed more after freshman running back Justin Davis left practice limping off the field with his left shoe off. Later, it was confirmed that he suffered an ankle sprain, but it has not been disclosed how serious it is.
Freshman safety Su’a Cravens took most of the first team reps over redshirt junior Dion Bailey. Bailey is still recovering from a bruised rib.
“It’s a bye week, so I’m getting healthy,” Bailey said.
Turning over a new leaf in the post-Kiffin era creates a unique opportunity for the entire program. Due to depth and injuries, players who have not received much playing time are now able to showcase their talent.
The team as a whole seems to have a positive outlook on the future as players left Howard Jones Field dancing, joking and cheering each other on after sophomore walk-on receiver Christian Tober hauled in a long touchdown pass to end the first practice of the Orgeron era.

Hope Orgeron brings back some of the fun and life to USC football and opens practices back up like the Pete Carrol days.
It is AN UNIQUE opportunity for the team at the moment. The harsh reality sets in next season, unless Haden surprises us.
Kiffin may end up working for his Dad down the road or pickup a HC position at a small school.
Coach O is an asset to the team. Losing his networking with recruits would undoubtedly set this Program a couple of years behind, which was why Haden was so reluctant in releasing Kiffin. Let’s hope his services are retained when the inevitable happens.
Haden has done a remarkable job given the circumstances. He held on long enough to truly give Kiffin a chance, despite the grumblings. He went out-of-the-box at LAX 3am on a Sunday morning to begin the change, as we are witnessing a form of 24/7 management.
UCLA Coach Jim Mora sounded disappointed in his comments regarding Kiffin’s departure. Despite his relatioship with the Kiffin family, I sense that he knew he had a better chance of beating SC with Kiffin there and that will change, hence his true disappointment.
When was the last time where our Men’s Head Football and Basketball Coaches are both new…a truly new era.

At a panel discussion on Wednesday, experts and students weighted the impact of the Affordable Care Act on young people.
Healthy debate · Panelists at the Students Talk Back forum on Wednesday afternoon discuss the possible impacts of the Affordable Healthcare Act. Some of the act’s policies went into effect on Tuesday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though the topic at hand was timely in light of the act’s role in the government shutdown, the panelists instead focused on informing the audience about the Affordable Care Act in general.
The USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in conjunction with the Schwarzenegger Institute hosted its weekly Students Talk Back discussion about the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday afternoon.
The Students Talk Back series features panelists and students in a discussion of political events that allows the audience to gain valuable insight into each topic.
These forums, which began five years ago, are a collaboration between the Unruh Institute and USC Sol Price School of Public Policy’s Schwarzenegger Institute.
This week’s discussion focused on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and specified what effects it could have on those in the 18- to 34-year-old age group.
The panelists each offered their own unique take on universal healthcare, drawing from their own fields of study, as well as personal experiences.
The panelists on Wednesday were Sarah Axeen, a doctoral candidate at the USC School of Policy, Planning and Development; Tamika Butler, the California director of Young Invincibles, a national organization dedicated to helping 18- to 34-year-olds learn about health insurance; Dana Goldman, the USC Norman Topping Chair in Medicine and Public Policy and director of the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and Julia Wick, a senior majoring in policy, planning and development.
Butler focused on debunking public perceptions about young people’s opinions on health care.
“When you talk to young people, there is this misconception that young people don’t want insurance,” Butler said. “[Insurance companies’] logic has been, ‘Don’t waste your marketing dollars on them, they don’t want to get insured, they don’t want it, they’re young, relatively healthy and they think they’re invincible.’”
Butler tied in her own personal experience to emphasize why she felt health insurance should be a bigger issue to young people.
“I’m pretty clumsy, so I know I’m not invincible,” Butler said. “We all know people like this, we all know young adults who actually do want insurance.”
According to Butler, surveys show that the main reasons young people do not have health insurance is because they cannot afford it, they are too old to stay on their parents’ plan or they are unemployed.
“All those issues are going to be addressed by the Affordable Care Act,” Butler said.
Goldman offered additional insight into the economics and the potential fiscal consequences of the Affordable Care Act.
“The question is: Are the benefits too generous? Will they grow over time? So next year, what if it turns out that not enough young people enrolled?” Goldman asked. “I don’t think we have to modify the act. We need to figure it out … We need to see what happens. If everyone said, ‘Can we make this law work?’ the answer is that actually yes, we just need to figure out maybe we should be less generous and have more penalties.”
Many of the students who attended the event said they enjoyed the variety of perspectives offered by the panelists.
“What was really good about this panel was the variety of the panelists who had different areas of expertise in the same topic,” said Lena Hoober, a graduate student studying chemistry. “I think [Goldman] made some excellent points. We need to really focus on what is making health care so expensive in this country and why this is such an important issue to solve.”
Wick also said she enjoyed the wide range of perspectives offered by the panelists as well as how passionate they were about the topic.
“We had really engaging speakers and I learned things that I didn’t know [until today],” Wick said. “I really liked the juxtaposition of having someone like Tamika who really does outreach, and someone like Dana, who is so well versed in the policy issues and their greater implications.”
Candy Hwang, a doctoral candidate studying chemistry, said she attended the forum to learn more about the Affordable Care Act and its effects on Congress’ decision to shut down the federal government.
“I wanted to learn more about [the Affordable Care Act] because the government shutdown is happening now, and we don’t all really know why it is happening. All we hear is ‘Obamacare’ and the House and Senate can’t agree on bills, and it deals with this Affordable Care Act,” Hwang said. “The only thing I’ve heard is that the Affordable Care Act is a law, but right now Congress is fighting over it. It was really great to come because [the panelists] talked about this act and how it affects students that are our age.”

From a fb friend… Welcome to reality sheep. A comment posted on the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare FB page: “I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 “Silver Plan” and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I “opt-out” and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the “REPERCUSSIONS PORTION” for “non-payment” of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with “Non-Payment” and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy “Automatically withdraw” your “penalties” weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is “Free” or even “Affordable.”
May, there are so many false statements in your post that I don’t even know where to begin. Perhaps the person who posted that on FB is being scammed by someone. But here are a few facts:
1) Out of pocket expenses are capped at $6350 per individual or $12,700 per family – there is no such thing as a $13,988 yearly deductible allowed in the Affordable Care Act
2) the premiums are paid to an insurance company, not the government
3) the maximum fine for the first year is $95 for an uninsured individual or $285 for a family
4) the fine will be collected by the IRS – they will not bill you – they will just not send you a tax refund if you are getting one. If you don’t get a tax refund for the year – they will just wait until you do get one.
5) your drivers license will NOT be suspended
6) you have until March 15, 2014 to decide on whether to get coverage
6) you do not pay the insurance company until coverage begins – which is January 1st at the ear list.
“All those issues are going to be addressed by the Affordable Care Act,”   Right.  
We had to pass this behemoth Bill to find out what’s in it.  
My Premiums are going up about 30% because of it; Great deal.

Though getting coffee for bosses might be an outdated stereotype of college internships, debate and controversy continue to surround the practice.
According to an investigation released by ProPublica on Tuesday, Northwestern University began asking companies where students intern to begin paying the interns. NU’s Medill School of Journalism requires students to complete a semester long internship.
Internships  can play an influential role in students’ career choices and open the door to professional opportunities. Many believe that unpaid internships, however, create a blurred line between a company creating a hands-on experience for students and taking advantage of students.
The debate about paid internships versus unpaid internships is a serious concern to many USC students. The USC Career Center works with students through programs, workshops and one-on-one meetings to help them obtain internships.
“It’s really hands-on experience that allows a student to test drive an industry or organization,” said Lauren Opgenorth, assistant director of internships and special programs at the USC Career Center. “They can take what they’ve learned from the classroom and apply it.”
Internships can also be the path to a job. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers’ 2013 Internship & Co-op Survey, employers made full-time offers to 56.5 percent of their interns.
Internships can vary significantly. They range from just a few hours per week to a full-time commitment, paid to unpaid, with a stipend or for class credit. Responsibilities also vary for different positions.
The United States Department of Labor outlines a test with six criteria that determines whether interns must be paid under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The criteria states that interns cannot take the place of regular employees, both the employer and the intern understands that the intern is not entitled to pay, that the intern must get hands-on experience and that the intern’s time in the position must primarily benefit him or her.
Some students, however, say they are frustrated by the prevalence of unpaid internships because they believe their work at such internships often mirrors the work of a paid, full-time employee.
“I am super appreciative of the experience, but at the same time I’m doing exactly the same thing that [paid employees] are doing,” said Mary Vu, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law.
Vu interned for JusticeCorps, who trained her in small claims court processes, from 2012 to the summer of 2013 for 10 hours each week. The internship was unpaid, but Vu was granted a small stipend after completing the program.
Many students are willing to complete unpaid internships even though they believe them to be unfair.
“I know [companies] take advantage of [unpaid interns], but that’s just how it is in this society,” said Harold Min, a junior majoring in business administration.
Min completed an unpaid summer internship with Aflac, an insurance agency, in the human resources department, working a minimum of 20 hours per week.
Other college students complete  internships simply to make their resumes shine.
“Human resources is not something that I want to pursue,” Min said of his internship. “I just did it for my resume…It’s an attention grabber when potential employers see it on my resume.”
Andrea Lawler, a senior majoring in electrical engineering and writing for screen and television who works as a paid intern for Walt Disney Imagineering disagreed with the resume-boosting philosophy.
“If somebody just wants to put something on their resume, I feel like they’re not getting the most out of an internship as they can,” Lawler said.
Cristina Mello, a junior majoring in music industry who interned at SUPERGOODMUSIC in April, agreed.
“This internship has taught me that at the end of the day, it’s about how much you put yourself out there and how much you’re willing to branch out and network in your field,” Mello said.
Networking is just one of many benefits an internship can provide.
“As long as you’re having some sort of practical experience, working on your transferrable skills and learning a little bit more about an industry, it’s a win-win,” Opgenorth said. “People underestimate the value of an internship. It really is a catalyst for student’s careers.”

The USC Gould School of Law hosted a reception to honor the president-elect of the California State Bar, Luis J. Rodriguez, Wednesday evening at Town and Gown.
Rodriguez, who will be sworn in as the 89th president of the state bar on Oct. 12, is the first Latino, as well as the first public defender, to become president of the state bar.
Gould faculty, California law professionals and law students attended the event. Many were excited for what Rodriguez’s election meant for the position.
“He’s breaking down a lot of barriers that have been up for a long time,” said Olga Peña, a second-year law student and president of the Latino Law Student Association. “[It’s] a way to combat a lot of stereotypes because there’s still a feeling in the community that certain people become lawyers, and not all people become lawyers.”
Robert K. Rasmussen, dean of the Gould School; Jackie Lacey, Los Angeles district attorney and USC alumna; Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney, and Rodriguez himself all spoke at the event.
“Luis has done a lot and he’s forever committed to being the voice for those who have no voice,” Lacey said.
Rodriguez attended Santa Clara University for both undergraduate studies and law school, but Rasmussen welcomed him to the Trojan Family at the end of the speeches by presenting him with an honorary gavel. The two also posed for a picture with matching “Fight On” signs.
“Diversity is a foundational principal of our law school,” Rasmussen said. “We have always been committed to making sure that our law school looks like California and when someone like Luis succeeds, we all succeed.”
Rodriguez also praised the Gould School for its ongoing commitment to diversity. More than 40 percent of the incoming law school class is a minority, according to Gould faculty.
“Of the incoming law school class of 175 [students], 31 are Latino, which is unheard of in so many other institutions of higher learning. [Rasmussen’s] commitment to diversity is very valuable,” Rodriguez said. “I’m looking forward to working with USC.”
Rodriguez already has experience working with students. As a past president of the Mexican American Law Association, Luis worked as a mentor to law students.
“I was given him [as a mentor] because I want to work as a public defender, and he was also part of the public defender’s office of Los Angeles County,” said Evan Langinger, Rodriguez’s former mentee and a third-year law student at Gould. “This is a huge deal. He’s the first Latino elected to be head of the state bar, and I think more importantly, the first public defender to be president of the state bar.”
Langinger works with Peña as part of USC’s Latino Law Student Association’s executive board. The group holds clinics to help people in the community, as well as volunteers at a teen court at Roosevelt High School.
“We try to be here for the community and to do things for the community,” Peña said.
The reception for Rodriguez was sponsored by several Los Angeles law firms. According to the law school, the sponsors raised close to $50,000, which will be donated in Rodriguez’s name to the Gould School’s immigration clinic. Students in the law school provide pro bono legal services to clients. The clinic has become a go-to place for transgender Mexican immigrants seeking asylum because of hate crimes committed against them in their home country.
“clinic has become a go-to place for transgender Mexican immigrants seeking asylum”
This type of nonsense is why you have USC law school graduates $215,000 in debt, living at home with their parents into their 30s, and unable to find law firm jobs.

The recent success of two USC alumni, Beck Bennett and Kyle Mooney, has brought the world of improvisational comedy at USC into the spotlight.
During their time at USC, Bennett and Mooney were members of Commedus Interruptus, an improvisational theater and sketch comedy group that performs free shows on campus. Bennett and Mooney are two of the newest performers to join the cast of Saturday Night Live. The casting was announced on Sept. 16, and the pair appeared in their first show on Sept. 28.
“I was really excited because I knew [their casting] was going to bring a lot of attention to Commedus. I think it was about time because we haven’t gotten a lot of support in the past,” said Michael Sturgis, a member of the group and a sophomore majoring in psychology and theater.
Besides free performances in front of Tommy Trojan on Fridays, Commedus Interruptus also hosts events at Ground Zero Performance Café and Bovard Auditorium.
Members of the group were excited to hear that two of their alumni had been cast in such a well-known television show.
“It was fantastic to hear that Kyle and Beck made it onto the cast,” said Frank Gullihur, a junior majoring in theater. “I immediately told everyone I knew. Here are two people that are in the same troupe as me, and now they’re on SNL!”
Joining Commedus Interruptus is a competitive process. There are multiple rounds of auditions, as well as a six-week-long workshop.
Gullihur noted how auditions are typically teeming with enthusiastic prospective performers — nearly 80 to 100 people audition each year.
Currently, the troupe consists of seven cast members.
Paul Stanko, a graduate of the theater program, remembered the intensity of the tryouts.
“I auditioned as a freshman. I didn’t even make it to callbacks,” Stanko said. “My improv was weak, and I really had no idea what I was doing.”
Stanko said he took the initial rejection as an impetus to improve.
“I took my freshman year to really polish up my improvisational skills, gained a new appreciation for the art behind what Commedus was doing, and went back guns blazing sophomore year,” Stanko said. “Somehow, I tricked them into taking me.”
Richy Storrs, a junior majoring in theater, said Bennett and Mooney’s success will inspire the USC entertainment community.
“It gives us hope for our own future as writers and actors, especially since a lot of their sketch ideas came from original ideas they had come up with for the biannual Commedus Sketch Show,” Storr said. “What Beck and Kyle are doing is definitely something that I am currently aiming for: to bring joy and humor to as large an audience as possible.”
Bennett and Mooney aren’t the first ones to make it big after their time with Commedus Interruptus. Jason Reitman, who has directed films such as Juno and Thank You for Smoking, was also a member of the troupe.
According to Stanko, this success is not as much about the snappy jokes as it is about the amount of time and energy invested into the craft.
“If you love something enough, and you throw yourself into that, you can get to the top of the game. Kyle and Beck did just that,” Stanko said. “They loved comedy and they kept at it, and now they’re in the big leagues. Anyone can get there; it’s just a matter of work ethic.”

Congratulations, Beck and Kyle! As a Trojan parent if a freshman, I was lucky enough to get to see Commedus Interruptus during Move-in Day. As a performer myself, I was mightily impressed with the talent of this young improv group.
I look forward to seeing these Trojans on SNL!

AMC Theaters, arrest me. I’m guilty. Last year, I spoiled a movie by adding my own soundtrack. And it was just terrible.
To set the scene, I was sitting by myself in the second to last row at a showing of Argo. The lights had long gone down and we were nearing the end of the film, which was a chase scene through the streets of Tehran.
In my pocket, I felt the unnerving succession of vibrations that has come to be associated with a phone call. The vibrations finally stopped, but it was at that very moment that I wished they would continue. Because after my phone registered the missed call, it began playing Pandora, which I had left open.
I’ll pause here for a moment to give some relevant background. My phone has a glitch. When I miss a phone call, it begins playing music. Usually, I combat this by turning my speaker volume to the lowest setting before I go, well, just about anywhere. But I forgot on that day, which was especially unfortunate because my Pandora had been set to my Zac Brown Band station (don’t ask). And so, the song that began reverberating throughout the theater was a Rascal Flatts song — don’t ask me which one since the discography of that particular band is, thankfully, something I know very little about.
At that particular moment, I felt as if the whole audience was staring at me. It did make a great story when the same phone glitch struck a few weeks later during a small class discussion. At the time, though, it was embarrassing enough that I stayed past the entire credits to make sure as few people as possible caught a glimpse of the perpetrator — yours truly.
Last week, I wrote about how we use our cell phones, even going so far as to cite a survey showing 9 percent of Americans said they use their mobile device during sex, and twelve percent saying they’ve used the devices in the shower. As I gave the issue a bit more thought, I realized that was only telling half the story.
We don’t just use cell phones. Our cell phones can be used without us knowing.
They can be used to add your own soundtrack (or really, to be fair, I suppose it was actually Rascal Flatts’ soundtrack).
Cell phones can be used to creepily keep tabs on your friends using the “Find Your Friends” app. This app, if downloaded on your phone, allows friends with the app to see where you are and vice versa. I believe another term for that is stalking. Awkwardly enough, though not nearly as awkward as the Argo incident, I possessed this application for a little while during my freshman year. After my friend downloaded it for me, I was telling him a story in which I mentioned that I was near his house. His response: “I know.”
Of course, Siri comes to mind as someone who uses my phone without my permission. As a disclaimer, Siri and I are on a break, so I don’t have too many nice things to say about her (in case you were curious, she told me she didn’t know what I was talking about but could search for it on the Internet one too many times).
Anyway, I find that Siri often opens up in my phone without my realizing and starts doing random tasks or, mostly, just searching phrases on the Internet. Oh, if I had a quarter (even a dime) for the number of times I have had Siri begin blathering to me without my asking.
Not only can cell phones be used without us, they can also be used against us. Via Wi-Fi, technology exists for retail stores to track a customer’s movement through its store. They can see what type of item a shopper is looking at and for how long.
Admittedly, many times my cell phone is working positively for me when it’s engaging in activities that I’m blissfully unaware of. Recently, I began using my calendar to, you know, actually write down times when I was busy. And it’s pretty amazing how quickly my calendar syncs from phone to computer.
That embarrassingly funny ringtone that spontaneously erupts in a quiet classroom can be amusing from time to time. Sometimes our cell phone sounds can even advance the plot of a story — looking at you, “Breaking Bad” series finale. But most of the time, especially when you’re the victim, you just want to say Argo you-know-what yourself.

There is a sentiment amongst critics and fans alike that great bands push their own boundaries, trying with each album to explore new territory. And though there is definitely merit in innovation, with its new album B-Room, Dr. Dog has put together a strong case for sticking with what you know.

On the album, the band brings back its signature brand of psychedelic fuzz-folk, full of crooning harmonies that draw instant comparisons to ’60s groups such as The Beach Boys and The Band. What B-Room lacks in ambition, it makes up for with its feel-good tracks.
The sounds and influences might be old, but the Philadelphia outfit decided to build themselves a brand new studio for this latest effort. It tracked everything live in an attempt to give an honest sonic snapshot of the band’s sound.
Artists who make albums around concepts like this run the risk of becoming gimmicky, especially when it names the album after the new studio. Conversations about the upcoming album usually centered around this fact and mentioned little about the actual content. It seemed possible that there might not be much to the album beyond its appeal to the independent listeners who approve of the band’s lack of commercialism.
It only takes a few minutes of listening to realize that this is not the case. If there is one thing that sets Dr. Dog apart from its hipster contemporaries, it’s the refreshing sincerity of the musical delivery. There is absolutely no irony in bassist Toby Leaman’s voice as he delivers the last words of a dying man in “Too Weak To Ramble.” The stripped down ballad consists only of vocals and two guitars and evokes the lo-fi aesthetics of its earlier albums Toothbrush and Passed Away, Vol. 1. And though there are some moments on the album where the band seems steeped in regret and disappointment, these sentiments never come off as bitter or sarcastic.
B-Room borrows from all across the spectrum of Dr. Dog’s previous recordings and styles, from its avant-garde debut Psychedelic Swamp to its more recent high-energy style catered to live performance. Everything was recorded without overdubs; what is heard on the album is supposedly what would be heard in a room with the band and nothing more. This is apparent on tracks such as “The Truth,” which starts out with only a sparse guitar over a driving drum beat. The open-ended quality of this track allows the band to slowly build layers of marimbas, pianos and voices until it reaches a dramatic, anthemic ending.
B-Room is Dr. Dog’s third record with drummer Eric Slick, and it feels like it has figured out how to balance his bombastic style with the band’s understated delivery. Dr. Dog has never made drum-centric music; there is not a single drum solo in its whole discography. Still, there are songs such as the funky “Cuckoo” that show off the chops Slick developed playing in Zappa cover bands before joining Dr. Dog.
Not every song is an up-tempo funk tune; the range of moods is all over the place. The band moves seamlessly from “Twilight” — a song dripping with all the natural imagery of a Wordsworth lyrical ballad — to “Rock n’ Roll,” which uses a rockabilly-like sound to reminisce over the first time the band heard rock ‘n’ roll music as kids. The most memorable moments occur on tracks such as “Love” and “Broken Heart” — lighthearted ruminations on relationships infused with so much ’60s soul that it almost sounds like Motown. The subjects of these songs may be cliché, but the execution is so stellar that the subject matter is forgivable.
It might not be a drastic change of direction from the band’s earlier work, but B-Room does boast far more noticeable jazz, R&B, ska and funk influences. The song “Long Way Down” features Scott McMicken almost rapping his lyrics, with saxophones and trumpets punctuating between each line. The horns section is given much more attention on this track — in fact, there is a breakdown of call-and-response between the horns towards the end of the song that sounds like it was taken straight out of the songbook of fellow Philadelphian outfit The Roots.
It will be interesting to see how the band deals with this change when it goes on tour for the album. Its lineup for live shows typically consists of only the five core members and one person for auxiliary percussion and samples. As a result, the band might be forced to add more to its lineup because many of the songs on B-Room would feel incomplete without the accompanying orchestral instruments.
Some feel that Dr. Dog is wasting its potential to become a more relevant band by staying in its comfort zone. This is easy to say if you’ve only listened to the last few albums. But in reality, the band has come a long way. From its early experimental sound, to the lush, full-bodied soundscapes and arrangements of 2008’s Fate, to today’s bare-bones approach, it has put on a lot of different musical hats while keeping its overall identity as a rock band. Years from now, B-Room might only be seen in Dr. Dog’s timeline as a sign of its current infatuation with the organic. Even so, it will remain as effective then as it is now in its attempt to transport the listener into the middle of the studio floor.

With its steep, icy ridges, subzero temperatures and punishing lack of breathable oxygen, K2 has earned its reputation as one of the world’s deadliest mountains. As the statistics currently stand, one out of every four people who reach its snow-capped summit will die for their efforts. Regardless of the danger, or perhaps because of it, dozens of men and women travel to northern Pakistan every year to make the climb, risking life and limb for a taste of ephemeral glory.
Facing danger · The Summit follows a summer 2008 expedition of a group of 25 expert climbers in their attempt to scale K2. Eleven climbers died due to the journey’s extreme cold and perilous conditions. – Courtesy of Image Now Films
 
Nick Ryan’s debut documentary The Summit presents an attempt to understand the combination of courage and compulsive restlessness that drives these professional thrill-seekers to court death at every turn. The result is a captivating portrait of heroism, pragmatism and survival, set against the backdrop of one of the worst disasters in mountaineering history.
In the summer of 2008, an international expedition of 25 expert climbers set out to conquer K2. Within 48 hours, 11 people were dead, frozen stiff in makeshift body bags or dashed on the jagged cliffs below the mountain’s precipitous “death zone.” More would have perished had it not been for the actions of Gerard “Ger” McDonnell, a starry-eyed, scraggly bearded adventurer who lived just long enough to realize his dream of becoming the first Irishman to ascend “The Savage Mountain.”
The controversial trek, undertaken in the final days before the beginning of K2’s stormy season and marred by the death of two climbers early on, didn’t turn into a full-blown catastrophe until the final descent, when several massive ice seracs detached from a nearby glacier, cutting off key safety lines and leaving three members of the Korean team stranded roughly 27,000 feet above sea level.
Refusing to abandon them, McDonnell and another climber, Marco Confortola, volunteered to stay behind while the rest of their party continued down the mountain, ostensibly to summon help. Though Confortola ultimately survived the ordeal, McDonnell was never seen again.
Much of The Summit revolves around Ryan’s interviews with the 14 survivors, including McDonnell’s longtime friend and sherpa Pemba Gyalje. When presented together, the varying accounts of what happened on the mountain form a fascinating study of post-traumatic finger-pointing, a Rashomon-like panoply of half-truths and suppositions surrounding what went wrong and why.
The film undermines these moments of insight, however, by constantly assaulting its viewers with an uneasy mixture of archival footage and slickly produced reenactments, blurring the already woozy line between fact and memory. These “recreated” scenes, scripted by Mark Monroe  — it’s always disconcerting to see a screenwriting credit on a documentary — features a jumble of actors and real-life participants such as Gyalje, who are unnecessary distractions that only serve to hinder and distort an already riveting survival story.
Ryan’s decision to focus almost solely on McDonnell is also problematic, discrediting Confortola’s testimony and diminishing the loss of the other climbers, who appear as little more than faces on a grim, Battle Royale-style countdown. Judging from the recordings and memories shared by Pemba and various McDonnell family members, the late mountaineer was a fascinating figure: a safety-minded adrenaline junkie who knew the risks, took the necessary precautions and made no excuses for doing what he loved. Yet the choice to devote most of the film’s third act to the pain of his loved ones comes off as a bit too calculated, especially when they fly back to Pakistan to search for his remains.
Objectivity issues aside, some of cinematographer Robbie Ryan’s aerial shots of K2 and the surrounding Karakoram mountain range are absolutely stunning, a worthy tribute to one of the most awe-inspiring geological marvels on earth. Ryan, best known for his work with British director Andrea Arnold (Fish Tank, Red Road), has the uncanny ability to imbue natural spaces with emotional qualities. His K2 has all the brutal beauty of a slumbering giant, coupled with the implacable bloodlust of a horror movie slasher, picking off the ill-fated climbers one by one.
The film also benefits from the presence of Italian mountaineer, explorer and journalist Walter Bonatti, the youngest participant in the 1954 expedition that became the first to successfully climb K2. Bonatti was ultimately cheated out of his chance to try for the summit after the other mountaineers realized the athletic young man was unlikely to need supplemental oxygen, a feat that would eclipse their own oxygen-assisted climb. His story runs as a parallel narrative to McDonnell and the others, contrasting their fate with his struggle to earn his rightful place in history. The interview, completed just before his death, stands now as evidence of his vindication within the climbing community.
The Summit’s reach might exceed its grasp at times, but it still serves as a potent reminder of nature’s ability to inspire wonder and terror in equal measure. To reinforce the point, Fosco Maraini, a famous Italian climber, described how the mountain’s name spoke to its perilous conditions.
“[K2 is] just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars. It has the nakedness of the world before the first man — or of the cindered planet after the last.”

Barilla, the world’s largest pasta manufacturer, is now facing a global boycott after its chairman’s homophobic comments. According to the Huffington Post, the Italian company’s chairman, Guido Barilla, told the Italian radio station Radio24 that “our concept is not that of a gay family.” He added that if the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community does not agree with his stance, then “they can choose another pasta.”
Theodore Park | Daily Trojan
Many companies and organizations are objecting to Barilla’s views. Aurelio Mancuso from the advocacy group Equality of Italy said Barilla’s comments were “an offensive provocation.” Mancuso ordered an immediate boycott of all Barilla products.
But Barilla is not the only company with leadership tainted by prejudice. In fact, several other companies harbor similar anti-gay views. It is up to the consumer to be aware of these positions and do his or her part in eradicating this prejudice.
Though some people argue boycotting a company only hurts employees, money from the sale of products from discriminatory companies can actually go to support groups who work against those who are considered different, which means people could be contributing to an anti-gay agenda if they purchase Barilla products. Fast food restaurant Chick-fil-A announced its opposition to gay marriage back in 2012. This very public opposition to gay marriage proved the direct association between consumer to social issues. By buying a chicken sandwich from this company, customers’ money went to organizations such as the Marriage & Family Foundation and the Family Research Council, all of which have clear anti-gay agendas.
In July 2012, The Jim Henson Company, which is behind the Muppets, cut all ties with Chick-fil-A due to its opposition to gay marriage. The two companies once had a history of collaboration. According to the Huffington Post, The Jim Henson Company donated all its proceeds from Chick-fil-A to the charity Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination (GLAAD).
Target Corporation, for example, is another massive company with an anti-gay position. According to Right Wing Watch, Target gave $31,200 to anti-gay candidates last election, such as Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who according to Right Wing Watch, is “one of the most extreme anti-gay culture warriors in the country.” Right Wing Watch said that in the first half of this year, Target gave $50,000 to the Republican Governors Association and spent nearly $3 million this year on behalf of Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial campaign.
Buying products from any discriminatory company, whether it be Barilla or Chick-fil-A or Target or countless others, directs money to organizations with prejudiced beliefs. The consumer must be responsible and aware of such affiliations. It is vital that all consumers not only reanalyze the quality of the company of such products, but also the value of his or her beliefs. It is unacceptable to live in world full of bigotry, and the ethical thing to do is to take one’s business elsewhere.

Last week, I wrote that the Republican Party’s antics on the debt ceiling debate were a    serious threat to the party’s image. After a 21-hour speech by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in an attempt to block a Senate vote on a “clean” funding bill, it was clear that the GOP intended to hold the government hostage to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Despite how many times Senator Cruz read Green Eggs and Ham to an empty Senate, I wrote that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) would never in his wildest dreams double down on a shutdown when the Senate inevitably sent back a funding bill that stripped the ACA-defunding provisions.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
I was dead wrong. Like Lane Kiffin’s addiction to the screen pass on third-and-long, the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for the 43rd, 44th and 45th time to defund Obamacare, and a government shutdown was the inevitable result.
There is a lot to be said about the shutdown of nonessential services that began at midnight Tuesday. The non-confrontational types who refuse to point fingers because they fear, ironically, that they are playing into the partisan politics that have plagued us for years, will wonder why we can’t all get along. I should know — until two nights ago, I was one of them.
I wrote in my inaugural column nearly two months ago that disagreement should be productive. In other words, parties retreating to corners and not coming to the negotiating table is the ultimate failure of politics. I wish I could say the same now — that the solution to the government shutdown is to come to the negotiating table and hammer out our differences — but I can’t.
It defies common sense to say that we should “negotiate” over A) funding the government, and B) implementing a law that was passed by Congress, signed by the president, declared constitutional by the Supreme Court and then verified in a national presidential election that was in many ways a referendum on the law itself (spoiler alert — the GOP lost by five million votes).
On this issue, there can be no negotiation. House Republicans have grossly abused their constitutional power to originate funding bills, and made a steaming mess of an already broken system.
There are millions without work in the United States. Student loans are crushing college students under piles of debt. Folks on food stamps and children in Early Head Start, a child development program, face deep cuts to that facilities they need so much. In the midst of it all, Republicans have decided the most important issue (besides “voter fraud,” of course) is a woman’s access to birth control and protecting insurance companies from children with pre-existing conditions. Furthermore, they’re willing to shut down the government for it.
Most ironic of all is that despite the closing of the Smithsonian, the furloughing of thousands of government employees and the turning off of the Panda Cam at the National Zoo, the ACA is still being implemented. The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the government websites where consumers can now purchase insurance opened without any impact at all from the government shutdown.
Let the facts speak for themselves: A Quinnipiac national poll released Tuesday shows 72 percent of American voters oppose Congress shutting down the government in their effort to block implementation of the law. According to the poll, voters also chose a Democratic candidate over a Republican candidate 43 percent to 34 percent in a generic ballot, the widest Democratic margin measured so far for the 2014 elections.
This is only round one. Remember that thing called the debt ceiling? That’s the limit on federal borrowing that must be raised by Oct. 17, when the federal government will literally run out of money to pay its bills and default on every payment from bonds to social security. Unlike the government shutdown, which has happened before (most recently in 1995), this could be a collapse of apocalyptic proportions, and the Republicans in the House have a list of demands waiting to hold that negotiation hostage, too.
It’s slash and burn guerilla tactics at its finest. According to Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, “Once [Obama] starts making concessions to people who threaten to blow up the world economy unless they get what they want, he might as well tear up the Constitution.”
The backward-looking ideologues who make up today’s Republican Party might do both. Our house is divided when it lets disagreement impede policy progress. Today, our house is divided because it has stopped caring about the people who elected it. Like Lane Kiffin, House Republicans might be looking for a new job next season.

A Response to this Article: http://dailytrojan.com/2013/10/06/letter-to-the-editor-93/
I’m constantly amazed that the higher USC raises its tuition, the fewer economic conservatives it attracts.  I’m a J’School graduate (’58).  When we were laying out the DT, across Jefferson Blvd. from the Shrine Auditorium, we had a terrible time finding leftists to argue with most of our editorials.  Tuition was $12 a unit when I started in 1951.  I took off two years in 1953 to attend the Korean and Cold Wars.  When I returned in 1956, tuition had soared to $28 a unit.  Still, I was able to make ends meet with a $1000-a-year annuity and the Korean GI Bill.   We still had trouble finding leftists with whom to argue on the USC campus.
Now that tuition has risen to well above what a sensible person would possibly spend on an 18-year-old, it’s almost impossible to find a conservative argument among the balkanized Trojans.  In 1958 we were Trojans.  Now we are Afro-American Trojans, Latino Trojans, Pacific Rim Trojans, LGBT-whatever-is-new Trojans–You-Name-It Trojans, whatever Trojans–with a highly paid administrative position to govern and pontificate about each.
Stop it!  Damn it!  We’re Trojans, or, at least, used to be.  Left-wing editorialists, professors, and administrations have made USC no more than another state-run school.  My dad was a Trojan, my mom was a Trojan, I was a Trojan; my daughter went to Cal because we could still afford it.  Today, she’s still a Trojan fan, and so are my twin granddaughters.  The notion of impoverishing the family to send them to USC to become Marxists at a gazillion dollars a unit is insanity, at best.
Fight On!

This is not a republican V. democrats issue. Every other government shutdown was related to budget deficits. I am sick and tired of hearing people blame “Tea Party Extremists” when the real gluten for punishment is the budget. There has to be funding.
Liberty Minded, you can’t be serious. The compromise by the “D” party is already in the Continuing Resolution that the “R” party won’t even take up for a vote in the House – it’s the sequester budget. The “R” party has a win staring it in the face but is so hellbent on defunding the (legally passed and Supreme Court-vetted) Affordable Care Act, it can’t see straight.
Keep up, will you?
If I understand correctly, elections have consequences. We do not have single party rule anymore. It is the “D” party that refused to compromise or even engage in a discussion on how to appease the new “R” party majority in the people’s House.
Ironically, a government shutdown is exactly what the “D” party desired – and the “R” party as well! The “D” party has a chance to rally its flagging base and now has 800,000 people to march on Washington without losing their jobs. The “R” party gets a rare “cut” in the federal budget. 
Now if only the “shutdown” can only last till 2014 we can make some real headway on the trillion dollar annual deficits.
I’m no Democrat, but one doesn’t need to be a Democrat to hate with every fiber of ones being, the GOP and the monster they have become.
I’d like to dedicate this quote to those hopelessly lost souls in the GOTea over in Congress..
“Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.”
