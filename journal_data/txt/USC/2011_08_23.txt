Beginning this semester, USC is offering a new minor in Korean Studies. The 20-unit minor will cover the political, economic, social and cultural changes in Korea. It will be interdisciplinary in nature, with course subjects spanning departments such as cinema, history, international relations, language and critical studies with a particular emphasis on Korea. There is no language requirement, but students are welcome to take Korean language courses to fulfill minor requirements.
The new minor is offered through the East Asian Studies Center in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Other paths of study within the center include a major and minor in East Asian Area Studies, but this is the first minor focusing on a specific country.
In recent years, USC has taken great strides to expand its Korean study programs and raise awareness of Korean culture, politics and US-Korean issues. In early 2010, the USC Korean Studies Institute established an exchange program with the National Assembly of Korea, cementing one of the most extensive partnerships the Korean National Assembly has made with any American university.
This past February the Institute hosted US Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Kathleen Stephens, who spoke about the future of the US-Korea relationship.

Saturday night’s Welcome Back Concert rocked McCarthy Quad, featuring the talents of Los Angeles’ own local indie bands Y Luv, Pepper Rabbit and, last but not least, Canadian band Tokyo Police Club.
The day also included carnival activities and a performance by the Trojan Marching Band, who revealed their new covers of Kanye West’s “All of the Lights” and LMFAO’s “Party Rock Anthem.” Both songs were incredibly well performed, igniting an outpour of school spirit from the crowd, holding up the Trojan salute throughout the entirety.
The crowd swelled as the night progressed and more audience members showed up to support the local indie bands as well as Tokyo Police Club. Y Luv and Pepper Rabbit proved to be an equal match to the headliner.
Although the majority of the audience was likely unfamiliar with the opening bands, the energy and praise of the bands indicated many indie-alternative music fans were left satisfied. Moreover, after their set Y Luv announced they were giving away free CDs at the merchandise table, and a huge crowd rushed over to pick them up.
Pepper Rabbit’s performance was also impressive, with their unique indie-pop sound using a myriad of instruments from multiple keyboards to a ukulele and of course strong vocals, which proved an essential part of their act.
By the time Tokyo Police Club took the stage, a much larger audience had gathered in anticipation of the classic indie-pop sound that has evolved throughout their albums, especially from their 2007 EP release of A Lesson in Crime, culminating in their most recent release, 2010’s Champ.
Tokyo Police Club’s set opened with their freshest single off of Champ, “Favourite Colour,” which set the upbeat mood for the rest of the night. This cheerful energy could be felt, heard and seen throughout the whole crowd.
The front row behind the barricade was packed with true Tokyo Police Club fans, singing close to every word of every song. However, every row behind that had their hands up in the air, cheering and screaming with every guitar solo or moment of powerful vocals. Frontman David Monks egged on the Trojan audience as he held up the victory sign, creating even more excitement.
The band members interacted with each other in a way that was entertaining, but not too overdone. Tokyo Police Club’s sound and image was definitely a refreshing change from the overplayed popular music played at most social events nowadays.
Overall, Tokyo Police Club’s set was very well-rounded, pulling from every corner of their music catalog and discography, playing all of their career-long officially released singles, including “Tessellate” and “Your English is Good,” and mixing in other indie gems to fill out the set list. When the band finished their set, they were called out back onto the stage and played a two song encore that satisfied anyone unsure about Tokyo Police Club and indie music in general before the concert.
The Welcome Back Concert was largely a success, organized by the Program Board’s Concerts Committee and led by a group of intelligent, dedicated individuals that pulled of this concert through a lot of hard work and perseverance. The Trojan community has a lot to look forward to from the Concerts Committee in the coming year based on the success of the Welcome Back Concert.

At the World University Games in Shenzhen, China, which lasted from Aug. 12-23, Nia Ali, a 2011 USC alumna, was just as impressive, running her way to the gold medal, winning all three of her races with times of 13.08 seconds in the preliminary round, 12.79 seconds in the semifinals and 12.85 seconds in the finals.
In June, Ali, then a senior, won the NCAA Division I women’s 100-meter hurdles, posting a personal record of 12.63 seconds as a member of the USC women’s track and field team.
Along with Ali, former Trojan Eva Orban, placed second in the women’s hammer throw with a personal record of 234-0 (71.33 meters). Orban, a native of Hungary, won the 2008 NCAA hammer title at USC.
Junior Aareon Payne, who was regarded as one of the top sprinters on the west coast as a freshman, participated in the women’s 200-meter dash, advancing to the semifinals. She placed seventh with a time of 23.85 seconds but did not advance to the finals.
In 2011, Payne earned 2011 All-America honors in both the 200-meter dash and as a member of USC’s 4×100-meter relay team.
On the men’s side, senior Joey Hughes placed sixth in the men’s 400-meter race.
Last season Hughes was undefeated in the 400-meter until the NCAA championships. He ranks seventh all-time on the USC 400-meter list with a time of 45.15 seconds.
Recent graduate Brendan Ames placed 10th in the 110-meter high hurdle semifinals. He did not, however, advance to the finals. As a 2011 All-American, Ames placed third at the NCAA championships with a personal record of 13.34 seconds.
Let us not forget two other silver medals earned at the University Games by Forel Davies (USC ’10) and Nadia Dan (USC ’12) losing to China in the final medal match.  However, the China team was the recent Silver Medalist at the World Championships so the second place finish for the USA team was huge as they had to beat the tough Russia team to make the final match.
On the men’s side, USA finished fourth losing to Macedonia in the bronze medal match.  Matt Sagehorn (USC ’09) is on the USA Men’s University team.

With USC’s Sept. 3 season opener against Minnesota looming, many position battles remain unsettled, namely the race to nab the currently vacant No. 2 wide receiver spot opposite sophomore wideout Robert Woods.
Experience · USC coach Lane Kiffin said he now feels comfortable with freshman quarterback Max Wittek taking snaps under center. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
That position, however, won’t be occupied by sophomore wide receiver Markeith Ambles.
USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Tuesday that Ambles, who was ruled academically ineligible for the fall semester, had withdrawn from school and would transfer to a community college, where he will play football and baseball. The former five-star recruit would also be eligible to play immediately.
“Markeith is no longer with our program,” Kiffin said. “We wish him the best of luck and we’re moving forward and hopefully he does good things.
But even with Ambles’ departure, the Trojans’ offense still has plenty of depth at the wide receiver position, which includes a talented pair of freshmen wideouts: George Farmer and Marquise Lee.
Farmer and Lee, as did Woods, attended Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., and have impressed coaches this spring, particularly Lee.
As a result of his play, Lee was allowed by the coaching staff to switch from No. 17 to No. 9 Tuesday.
“To No. 1, you have to work for it” he said. “I talked to the coach and he said I have to work hard for it.”
Lee’s quick adjustment, which has been similar to Woods from last season, has been attributed to his effort to mirror Woods.
“I study him all the time, just like all the other receivers,” Lee said. “It’s not just Robert, but it’s a lot of other receivers I pay attention to. They help me on my plays and make sure I know my stuff.”
—
Kiffin announced freshman tight end Junior Pomee would miss the entire season after he sustained a broken foot during Sunday’s scrimmage.
“I thought he was doing great for the little time we had him,” Kiffin said. “So we’re excited about getting him through rehab and ready for the spring.”
Because of Pomee’s injury, senior linebacker Ross Cumming and senior defensive end Zack Kusnir have switched to offense to fill the tight end position.
Though the Trojans lost one player, redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins returned to the practice field after missing five days because of torn ligaments in his throwing thumb sustained during a scrimmage.
“Hopefully he’ll be back [practicing] soon,” Kiffin said. “But it is good to have him back in meetings.”
Others, including sophomore wide receiver De’Von Flournoy, senior safety Marshall Jones and sophomore tight end Christian Thomas, did not participate in Tuesday’s practice. During practice, senior quarterback Taylor Ashton, redshirt freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, junior tailback Curtis McNeal and redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater were sidelined, but Kiffin noted the injuries were minor.
—
With the race for the No. 2 quarterback spot still ongoing, Kiffin made a point to acknowledge the strong play from freshmen signal callers Cody Kessler and Max Wittek. Though they have at times struggled with interceptions and adjusting to the speed of the college, the staff has admitted either should be able to shoulder the load should junior quarterback Matt Barkley be sidelined with an injury.
“I think both of them could go in and play for us right now” Kiffin said. “I’m shocked I’m even saying that.”
—
The defense continued its strong play, forcing a number of sacks and incomplete passes during Tuesday’s mock scrimmage. Senior linebacker Chris Galippo returned to practice following a shoulder injury and has had to battle freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson to maintain his stranglehold on the starting position.
“I’m feeling decent, but I can do better,” said Dawson, who was awarded the coveted No. 55 jersey last spring. “There’s a lot of tradition. There’s a lot of pressure for me, but I got to live up to the number. I’m steppin’ up to the challenges.”
As of right now, no position battles have been settled, according to Kiffin. For the remainder of the week, players will continue with normal practice before preparation for the season opener against Minnesota begins closer to the weekend.

They happened five months and more than 6,000 miles apart.
First, there was the late March press conference at the Galen Center in Los Angeles where first-team All-Pac-10 center Nikola Vucevic declared he was skipping his senior season at USC to enter the NBA draft.
Just last week, in a nondescript gymnasium outside Sao Paulo, star senior guard Jio Fontan landed awkwardly after being hit on a drive to the basket late in the first half of USC’s preseason game against a Brazilian professional team, tearing a ligament in his left knee and ending his season before it started.
USC’s 2011-2012 basketball season doesn’t tip off until mid-November, yet its two defining moments have already taken place.
The Trojans record is still unblemished at 0-0, but it feels like they’ve already lost so much.
Now, let’s spare the doom and gloom and refrain from calling this a lost season for USC basketball.
It is still only August and the Trojans have some intriguing young talent.
USC’s group of freshmen and transfers could end up gelling very well together.
A return trip to the NCAA tournament isn’t out of the question.
The season that will be, however, is overshadowed by what could have been.
With Vucevic and Fontan in the lineup alongside guard Maurice Jones, the Trojans would have returned their top three scorers from a season ago.
Instead, USC now only boasts two players on its roster that scored in a game for the Trojans last year — Jones and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson.
Newcomers Aaron Fuller and Dewayne Dedmon would have been expected to fill their roles solidly, not spectacularly.
Now, they will be counted on to shoulder a good portion of the offensive load.
The leftover effects of the O.J. Mayo scandal won’t help the team cope with the losses of Vucevic and Fontan, either.
“Right now, this third year, especially with Jio getting hurt, that’s when you get hit with the remnant of these sanctions where we lost two recruiting classes,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We have a bunch of inexperienced guys that have never played. They’re going to get a lot of experience early and hopefully they respond well and turn themselves into a really good postseason team.”
This could have been a banner season for recently rejuvenated USC basketball.
After making only six NCAA tournament appearances from 1962 to 2000, the Trojans have qualified six times in the last 11 seasons.
USC’s runs to the Elite Eight in 2001 and the Sweet 16 in 2007 marked the first time the program had made it past the second round of the Big Dance since 1954.
“Our only goal is to make the NCAA tournament and try to win the Pac-12 title,” O’Neill said. “Those are our goals and I don’t think we should change those goals.”
Fontan’s injury was an especially cruel blow to the Trojans, with his teammates forced to watch their leader stretchered off the floor.
“In my career, I’ve never felt worse for a player than I feel for him,” O’Neill said. “The first two and a half games [of the Brazil trip], he was playing at a first-round-NBA-draft-pick level. I feel bad for him that way and bad for our team that he can’t be there to lead us and do all the things that a guy of his caliber would do.”
Freshman Alexis Moore, from Long Beach Poly High, will be tasked with stepping into Fontan’s spot in the starting lineup.
“He’s going to have to be a guy that doesn’t play like a freshman,” O’Neill said. “And even then, it’s going to be very difficult for a guy his age to step into his role that requires a ton of leadership, especially for what is a very young and inexperienced team now.”
The schedule will do the Trojans no favors, either.
With non-conference games against Kansas, San Diego State and Georgia, a potential tournament date with North Carolina in Las Vegas and a challenging Pac-12 slate, USC’s young players will be tested early and often.
This season, however, will not make or break USC basketball.
The gains the Trojans have made over the last decade have been substantial. The program weathered the storm of NCAA sanctions while enjoying its greatest run of success in recent history.
The future remains bright for the Trojans — a talented and youthful roster, an experienced head coach and a recruiting foothold in the Southern California basketball market are all long-term assets.
The short term gains of the 2011-2012 year, however, don’t look nearly as promising as how they were projected six months ago.

You must be dreaming if the future looks bright. The team is full of transfers from everywhere no impact players on the horizon. You bring in a player with one year of eligibility that doesn’t sound like much future to me.

The USC men’s basketball team, left for Brazil ealier this August with some work to do.
Down and out · Senior guard Jio Fontan, pictured here during a Feb. 12 game against Oregon, scored 57 points in the first two games of USC’s exhibition series before tearing his ACL. The New Jersey native will apply for a medical redshirt with the NCAA to gain a sixth year of eligibility. - Daily Trojan file photo
Using an NCAA exception to play preseason games abraod, the Trojans looked to figure out just how its pieces fit together before the start of the 2011-12 season.
After a season where he led USC in assists and finished second in scoring, senior guard Jio Fontan, the fifth-year senior, seemed poised to provide much-needed leadership.
Fontan looked to be up to the challange, scoring a combined 57 points in the first two games of USC’s Brazilian exhibition tour.
In the third game, however, Fontan was hurt after landing awkwardly while making an aggressive move to the basket with 4:24 remaining in the first half against Mogi das Cruzes. The shell-shocked Trojans went on to lose the exhibition game 81-70.
Fontan cut the trip early to return to Los Angeles, where it was determined he tore a ligament in his left knee, which will require season-ending surgery.
“Our style of play is going to have to change from what we thought it was going to be with Jio,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We are going to have to re-evaluate over the next couple of months before we start practice what we are going to need to do to be competitive in this league with nobody of any experience whatsoever.”
Fontan is expected to be replaced in the starting line-up by 6-foot-2 guard Alexis Moore, a freshman from Long Beach Poly. With Fontan out, Moore recorded 16 points and four assists in the Trojans’ final exhibition against Tijuca.
“[Moore] played well,” O’Neill said. “It is going to be incumbent upon him to step up and do some good things because it eliminates a lot of our guard depth with him not being on the bench, and forced to start as a freshman.”
Maurice Jones, a sophomore who started alongside Fontan for much of last season, can also slide over to play point guard. The only other guards on scholarship are junior Greg Allen, a transfer from Navarro College and Byron Wesley, a freshman from Etiwanda High School.
The Trojans will count on a slew of inexperienced players next season. Jones, who averaged 9.9 points last season, and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson, who contributed an average 3.2 points per game, are the only two returning players who scored a point for USC last season.
“[Fontan’s injury] eliminates a huge experience and leadership level, and we need to find guys to take over that role,” O’Neill said.
After struggling with foul trouble early in the trip, center Dewayne Dedmon, a redshirt sophomore who transferred from Antelope Valley College, had 15 points, five rebounds and three blocks against Mogi das Cruzes, and 19 points, five rebounds and four blocks in the final exhibition against Tijuca.
Jones scored 16 or more points for the Trojans in the final three games.
The Trojans finished the exhibition tour 2-2, defeating Tijuca and Pindamonhangaba, while falling to Mogi das Cruzes and Sao Jose dos Campos.
The trip allowed USC to hold 10 practices in August prior to departure, rather than having to wait for the traditional start of practice in mid-October.
“The only bad thing that happened on the trip was the injury to Jio,” O’Neill said. “The rest was a great trip for everybody.”
The Trojans open the 2011-2012 season at home against Cal State Northridge on Nov. 11.

These days it seems there’s always something new and exciting in social media and technology, be it iPads or e-books. The latest noteworthy advancement is a new social networking application for smartphone users, ntro.
Busy bees · The ntro staff has made its presence known at USC by setting up tents, handing out promotions, sending dancing, life-sized bees all over campus and recently, covering students’ bike seats with yellow seat covers. - Rohan Aurora | Daily Trojan
The cool part? Ntro is in the midst of its launch and it’s being exclusively offered at USC.
On Aug. 19, the California-based company nProgress Inc. launched this social discovery app to help make connections with new friends through shared interests. At a university as large as USC, it can be difficult to find your niche and that’s where ntro steps in.
“On a college campus like USC, you literally walk by hundreds of people every day,” said Josh Resnick, founder and CEO of nProgress Inc. “Ntro helps you discover … shared interests and connect over them. You can use the app to find study partners, sports and workout partners, or even just to discover other people who share your love of marathon running, cult zombie films or whatever your interests might be.”
Still not quite sure what we’re talking about? If you saw the dancing bees in McCarthy Quad, the In-N-Out truck generously offering hundreds of burgers, Sprinkles cupcakes up for grabs and so forth then you’ve come across ntro. If you’ve crossed paths with one of these promotions or you’ve noticed your friends are increasingly more interested in their smartphones, there’s a reason for it. Ntro’s presence can evidently be felt everywhere around campus.
Now that you’re up to speed, the app is currently available for free download to USC students using iPhone or Android handsets. All you need is a valid .edu email to register. You can also integrate the app with Facebook to sync your interests more efficiently.
USC caught the eye of ntro with its massive size and diverse student body. With more than 30,000 students attending USC and this year’s freshman class featuring the highest international percentage to date, Resnick and the ntro team couldn’t ignore the opportunity.
“We selected USC as our first campus to launch ntro because the culturally diverse student body represents our ideal user,” Resnick said.
Ntro started when two business partners, Resnick and Trey Watkins — both working in the video game industry at the time — decided to make use of smartphone features to ask questions about their interests and the interests of those around them to form new relationships.
“There are three features that make ntro a unique app,” Resnick said. “It runs in the background and notifies you when someone nearby shares the same interests, [it] offers high flexibility to the users to control their privacy settings and it was designed specifically with students in mind, with features like forming study groups and finding a workout partner.”
Ntro fosters a secure, gated community of students, maintaining privacy in the pursuit of common interests.
The ntro student group toolkit is another prime feature of the application. It gives users the ability to promote and recruit new members for student groups through use of the newsfeed to inform other ntro users.
“If there is a basketball event organized, all the ntro users with basketball as a mutual interest will be notified about the event,” Resnick said.
Ntro also plans on launching a “heat map” feature that will allow users to discover local hot spots based on their interests, Resnick said.
There’s also the option of Facebook integration, which can sync your interests more quickly.
“We will be rolling this app to the top 50 schools in the country over the coming year,” said Resnick. “And by 2012, we expect it to be everywhere.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this article states ntro would launch at UC Berkeley next week. The application has in fact already been launched at the UC Berkeley campus.
There are so many cool social networking apps out there now, but they’re useless unless enough people use them. I predict that Facebook will buy the best ones and incorporate them into its platform.
Hey I think i am forced to lean towards chucks comment..  its pretty much only a social networking app.. it has really started to get cliche right now..  but the part remains how different it is/will be from the usual things floating around. Though you seem to have provided a number of suggestions, i guess its not really that neccesary to be so harsh.. a little appreciation i guess goes a long way. But ofcourse I do agree that a little more content minus the solicitation would definitely have made it really  informative.
and btw real trojan.. I dont think you got the part about being critical. Anyways I guess you are smart enough to figure it out.
and rohan, If i do remember correctly you had had to give the ISE exam right?? I am actually wondering why? you seem to be pretty comfortable with the language. And i do applaud your effort. Keep it coming.
Gee Chuck, why’s it so important to you that the article is critical?  Maybe your app didn’t succeed but that doesn’t mean this one is as bad as yours.  If you thought there was something wrong with this app you could have mentioned it in your comment, but you probably didn’t even use the app.  Maybe you don’t even have a USC email.
I actually did check it out.  I’ll admit, the cupcakes got me.  I already use Facebook and G+ so I figured I’d probably just delete it because I don’t need another social networking app, but once I messed around with it a bit I realized it was different.  Instead of connecting with people I know I can find new people with similar interests.  In the beginning I only found people when I was set to board, but after I went back and added more interests to my profile it started letting me know when other people were around.  It’s a bit rare to find matches now but it seems like they’re trying hard to get more students signed up so I have high hopes there’ll be plenty of matches soon.
How’s that for a student’s opinion Chuck?
Amazing.  They must have paid well for this breathless fan-boy review.  Please try to be more critical of your subjects.  This is just another startup with a dumb social networking app.  How about talking to a student to see their real opinion of this ‘service’?  How about a comparison to the dozen other similar apps?  How about a discussion of the other two services that also launched exclusively at USC and failed?  This kind of mindless free advertising does nothing to inform your readers, and debases the reputation of the Daily Trojan.  You should be ashamed.

Thursday was recently crowned “The Day to Get Down” as 180,000 people visited The Weeknd’s website to download his new mixtape. Thursday.
The second installment of Abel Tesfaye’s nightmarish mixtape trilogy, brings The Weeknd’s sound to another level by amping up the instrumentation and featuring a relevant and popular artist, Drake.
The Weeknd, a contemporary R&B solo act fronted by Canadian Abel Tesfaye, released his mixtape House of Balloons to widespread critical acclaim in March, while Thursday and Echoes of Silence, the third installment, were slated for summer and fall releases, respectively. Predictably, The Weeknd’s latest proves to be a success as well, as it listens like a mix of Drake — taking “Marvin’s Room” melancholy to the extreme — and a doped out Sade crooning over dark, hauntingly beautiful beats.
Thursday opens with “Lonely Star,” having The Weeknd harmonize, Baby you could have it all / baby you don’t need your best friends / cause I got everything you want, with fatal reassurance.
The Weeknd’s progression only builds from the emotionally disturbing opener as Thursday stumbles into unfamiliar production territory with “Life of the Party.” With production sounding like a black sheep in the family of tracks on Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Tesfaye welcomes you to the other side of his own creation with steady percussion, intense vocoder action and heavy synths.
One of the best-produced songs on the mixtape, “Life of the Party,” descends into the depths of drugged out production as it displays a bad example of peer pressure — it is hard to resist the pressure of indulging in this gem.
“Thursday,” on the other hand, is lyrically reminiscent of The Cure’s 1992 smash hit “Friday I’m In Love.” The similarities end there, however, as the production and ambiance of the track give a depressingly forsaken insight into the art of the “booty call.”
Even Drake got in on the sonic madness and publicly co-signed the act, making an appearance on “The Zone” — a standout on this mixtape. “The Zone” seems like it could have been pulled straight out of the track list for Take Care. The styles of The Weeknd and Drake blend seamlessly with a perfect falsetto chorus courtesy of Tesfaye and a killer verse by Drizzy. The production, the lyrics — seven minutes that could even get Britney Spears in the zone.
The Weeknd will be present on Drake’s own Take Care release. Maybe Canadian pride runs deep, or maybe their eerily similar sounds brought them together. Whatever the case, the collaboration on Thursday is a match made in heaven.
Thursday follows with “The Birds Part 1” and “The Birds Part 2.” The former is an intense warning (so don’t you fall in love / don’t make me make you fall in love) perched precariously over thumping war drums a là Beyonce of late.
The latter, a post-apocalyptic lament on fading love, juxtaposes itself nicely against the faster pace of Part I.
Together, “The Birds” illustrate a story of a star-crossed love, come and gone, that evokes eerie sentiments that would make Hitchcock proud.
“Gone” tours the various sensory reactions one feels under the influence (Drink it, drop it, drink it, spill it / You gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby). Production is minimal on the track, but the way Tesfaye spits the drink it, drop it lines are catchy and addictive — like a drug created by the artist himself. The song trails off into “Runaway” territory (See Kanye West … again), as the middle of the song is simply ambient sounds. At eight minutes long, the track could easily have been divided up, or simply shortened.
“Rolling Stone” creates the ambiance of looking out a window on a rainy day and features a much-welcomed acoustic guitar that shakes up the feeling of the mixtape. The simple repetition of chords offers a soothing tone to a mixtape often heavy and emotionally tempestuous. Similarly, “Heaven or Las Vegas” offers piano, drums and guitar that blend graciously with the new-wave R&B synths backing the track.
The Weeknd pushes the boundary of R&B on Thursday and offers a mature look into a dark nightlife culture that is full of intense, depressing and disturbing subject matter.
But, if up for the challenge, Thursday encompasses everything that music needs these days: real situations, real emotions and real people.
beautifly written, best review i’ve read.

Everyone knows the classic pop tune by The Cars, “Just What I Needed,” a song that served as an anthem for adolescents experiencing their first love.
Perhaps this is why Boston-native Kris Delmhorst altered the infectious rock/pop hit into a quirky melody of pure folk and fun. Indulging in the tenderness of her childhood, Delmhorst did not stop there. Rather, Delmhorst released her new album, Cars, on Aug. 16 as an eccentric tribute to the band, covering 11 of the group’s most well known songs.
Delmhorst is a natural alto vocalist, a skilled fiddle and guitar player and happens to have a quirky sense of music. Her previous five albums earned her praise for her textured voice and two nominations as outstanding female singer/songwriter at the Boston Music Awards.
In Cars, Delmhorst’s contagious vibrato, reminiscent of indie singer/songwriter Feist, deviates from the original pop ambience of The Cars. The Massachusetts local uses only the original arrangement and tempo of each song, replacing the techno sounds with an acoustic adaptation.
A synth, fiddle, organ and even some glockenspiel accompany Delmhorst’s vocals and cello solos, creating a unique sound for Delmhorst, as the point of the album is not to be comparable to that of The Cars’ indigenous sound but to develop a playful spirit suiting her folk genre.
The first track on Cars is the tune “You Might Think,” which has a melody so suited for Delmhorst’s voice it is hard to believe it was first sung by male artist Ric Ocasek. Having given the song a contemporary make-over, Delmhorst uses a fiddle and her wispy alto to reinvent the tune and make it an inevitable single.
This maternal figure indulges in her liberty of recording the pop single “Magic” as a beautifully constructed ballad with effortless vocals and a steady acoustic beat. The song, originally sung by The Cars, is sure to be recalled once one hears it; however, Delmhorst makes it seemingly unrecognizable — but in a positive sense. Her androgynous pitch and sedate tempo in this track allow lyrics such as How far can you take it ‘till you realize there’s magic in your eyes, to be appreciated poetically.
Her tune “Tonight She Comes” takes on a slightly Celtic feel, different from the usual techno sounds that are characteristic of The Cars. She hones in on the ideal harmonies of the latter, paying tribute to the original work while simultaneously establishing itself as its own progressive work.
Though the perfectly pitched and eclectically tuned voice of Delmhorst is the center of the album, much credit should be attributed to the accompanying musicians. In “My Best Friend’s Girl,” a killer electric guitar solo brings to memory the rock-beat The Cars first possessed.
More impressively, original keyboard player of The Cars, Greg Hawkes, assists in the acoustics with his ukulele. Her remaining musicians deserve much praise, especially considering their reinforcement of mandolins, harmonicas and accordions for the foot-tapping folk sensation present throughout the album’s entirety.
Though a seemingly underground performer, Delmhorst is an accomplished female musician of undeniable skill. Taking on the weightless lyrics of a former ’80s pop band, this folk singer combined impressive acoustic instrumentals with her folk style as a contemporary reinterpretation.
Even if country folk music is not your preference, Delmhorst can perhaps change your mind with this enticing new album. Check out Delmhorst’s recently released album Cars on her site krisdelmohrst.com for a blast from the past that contains a quirky, modern twist.

During the past few years, the basic “hop and bop” formula of 2D platform games — games that have two-dimensional graphics and feature protagonists side scrolling across the screen — from the 1980s and 1990s has made a startling comeback. Video game designers are creating more 2D platformers at an increasing rate, and people are buying them.
The worldwide success of contemporary 2D platformers, such as last fall’s Donkey Kong Country Returns, suggests a collective return to a more simplistic style of gaming. But how can such games attempt to compete or succeed in today’s Microsoft age of stunning graphics, fast-paced first-person shooters and sophisticated Internet technology?
Video game publishers seem to think it’s worth it. They continue to pump out the 2D platformers, and sales remain steady. Not surprisingly, Nintendo is one of the biggest contributors to the recent rise in 2D platformers.
The company’s bestselling Wii game is New Super Mario Bros. Wii, a 2D side scroller that has outsold the company’s more impressive-looking 3D platformer, Super Mario Galaxy, by more than 10 million units worldwide.
But the success of one 2D platformer isn’t merely a fluke. Last year’s Donkey Kong Country Returns has sold almost five million copies. Kirby’s Epic Yarn has also sold more than one million units.
It isn’t just Nintendo that is changing tactics either. In 2010, Sega introduced Sonic the Hedgehog 4 as a direct continuation to the immensely popular ’90s franchise.
These statistics point to a revitalized interest in 2D platformers, but is this actually the case?
Most of these games derive their success from 2D predecessors released two decades earlier. In the case of Nintendo and Sega, the two companies are clearly utilizing their global franchises, which is a primary reason why their 2D platformers are so successful.
Does this trend in 2D platformers mean the video game industry is slowly reverting back to its retro counterpart? Or is it simply a cash-hungry method of capitalizing on a tried-and-true franchise?
In reality, it’s a little bit of both.
Nintendo and Sega are not the only two companies launching 2D platformers, so the rise of this old-fashioned style cannot be attributed solely to the desire to resurrect and profit from a franchise. In July 2010, for example, Danish game developer Playdead released an exclusive 2D platform game for the Xbox 360 called Limbo. The downloadable game garnered critical acclaim as a remarkably creative and eerie tale, but unlike New Super Mario Bros Wii or Donkey Kong Country Returns, Limbo is not a part of a decades-long franchise. This supports the possibility that 2D platformers are finding fame naturally rather than through franchise exploitation.
Another explanation for the rise in 2D is that 2D platformers are viewed as a sort of backlash against 3D technology. Despite Nintendo’s attempts to market its Nintendo 3DS as an unparalleled, sophisticated gaming console, few consumers have actually gone out to purchase the item, leading to a massive price cut after just four months on the market.
In other words, 2D platformers offer simplicity and challenging game play that aren’t overshadowed by useless special effects.
Though 2D platformers aren’t going to overrun the video game market anytime soon — people still prefer their Call of Duty sequels and their high-definition blood fests over happy-go-lucky bouncing games — there is something to be said about 2D platformers: They are the easiest to learn and the trickiest to master. They are the games that almost anyone can play and also appeal to the widest potential audience.
Even in today’s obsession with 1080p graphics and multiplayer extravaganzas, there is no denying that sometimes simplicity reigns supreme.

Everybody is familiar with the big blockbusters of the fall: Paranormal Activity 3, Footloose, The Three Musketeers, Breaking Dawn Part 1, you get the idea. Although these films are valued in their own right — whether  part of an addictive series or an enthralling adventure — there’s something to be said for the foreign films that sadly, but typically, go unnoticed.

To redeem this travesty, take a look at these smaller foreign films equally deserving of attention. What they lack in name, they make up for with artistry, intriguing subject matter and full-fledged drama.
Circumstance (Iran, France, USA — Aug. 26)
In this scandalous coming-of-age story, two Iranian girls, Shireen and Atafeh, fight against the oppressiveness of tradition as they attempt to discover themselves through drugs and sexual rebellion. The teenage girls might have developed something beyond a platonic relationship and as Atafeh’s brother, Mehran, a former drug abuser, catches on, he becomes increasingly jealous and dangerously destructive.
Love triangles, family betrayal, controversial LGBT themes, teenage rebellion — what more could one ask from a progressive Middle Eastern film? The film also works with takepart.org to make a difference beyond the screen by creating awareness as it seeks equality in the lives of real women. Circumstance pushes the limit, in modern subject matter and distinct filming style, and with a cause backing the core issue at hand, this is one foreign film you won’t want to miss.
Brighton Rock (UK — Aug. 26)
Based on Graham Greene’s 1939 novel, Brighton Rock tells the story of Rose, a girl who witnesses a murder but falls hopelessly in love with the felon, Pinkie.
With star-studded power like the Oscar-winning Helen Mirren and newcomer Andrea Riseborough (of the heart-aching romance Never Let Me Go), Brighton Rock presents a cast that can’t be ignored.
Moreover, the film noir elements in the film enhance the secrets and mystery, enrapturing you in the danger. The British crime drama genre adds an enthralling air of mystery that will hold viewers until the end. Additionally, the edgy, dark aesthetic, seen in color scheme and costume design, adds a level of interesting complexity. With the dazzling Mirren behind the film, it’s sure to be charismatic, exciting and worthwhile to watch.
Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life (France — Aug. 31)
Only eccentric musicians, infamous lovers and the encapsulating Paris could tell this biopic of the world-renowned songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. Following him through his upbringing in 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris to his success as a 1960s Parisian songwriter and finally to his untimely death in the 1990s, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life provides an in-depth profile of one the most eclectic and scandalous musicians of his time.
The dark and exciting cinematography transports you to a different time and is excitingly gripping. Additionally, appearances by some of the most famous women of the time, Brigette Bardot and Jane Birkin for instance, add a suggestive and dynamic flair.
Finally, the film includes many of Gainsbourg’s greatest hits, allowing you to feel his success as you engross yourself in the life of this legendary music icon. Between the music, the lovers and the man, viewers are sure to be in awe at the life of this iconic songwriter.
The Skin I Live In (Spain — Oct. 14)
From acclaimed director Pedro Almodóvar, notorious for his dangerously sexy and provocative subject matter, comes his latest risqué film, The Skin I Live In. Antonio Banderas, who starred in one of Almodóvar’s first films, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, returns as a plastic surgeon haunted by a surgery gone wrong. To redeem his wrongs, Banderas creates an impenetrable synthetic skin and becomes obsessed with the woman who sports his creation.
Almodóvar is infamous for his plot twists so he’s sure to surprise; you’ll never know what to expect from him, leaving you hooked until Almodóvar’s
imminent, unthinkable revelation. With well-rounded characters who extend eternally deeper than the surface, a charismatic style, bold color use and hits such as Volver under his belt, Almodóvar is a director to be reckoned with and The Skin I Live In is a must-see film.

As a comparatively inexperienced and naïve freshman in the world of college, I entered my first class at USC on Aug. 18 — even though classes didn’t officially start until the 22nd.

Absorbed in my own little world trying to get things organized before school started, I couldn’t have cared less about discussing politics.
New students such as myself, however, were given just that opportunity. USC’s microseminars were advertised as a way to experience class before the start of school. We all wondered whether they would be as fascinating as advertised.
Luckily for all of us, they were. They gave us the opportunity to take an hour to ponder events that are presently impactful beyond the USC bubble, a difference from the typical topics we study during the year.
But when I finally bucked the courage to attend my first class in the Von KleinSmid building, I discovered there was a seminar dubbed “Arab Spring or Arab Winter?” taught by the knowledgeable Dr. Laurie Brand, professor of international relations.
As a youthful Egyptian, the seminar really opened my eyes to the situation abroad, which made it a valuable experience as opposed to one that could be forgotten within a couple of days.
Being Arab can have its advantages, namely an ability to relate to an uprising happening a couple continents away.
My miserably wonderful summer in Egypt gave me the insight and the experience necessary to fully appreciate the two-day seminar.
It was interesting to see most of my classmates were either of Arab origin, or had spent time in the Middle East. Certainly the environment you grow up in has influences upon your interests.
Whether discussing Tunisia and the cowardice of Ben Ali or asking about Arabic roots, the lecture was a truly insightful experience.
Back in Egypt, hardly a day passed without some form of resentful expression regarding the revolution, especially the contrast in perceptions on the “revolution” between the lower-income Egyptian middle class the wealthier classes.
According to Brand, the modern uprisings are less of revolutions than revolts. Though there certainly exists a fair amount of violence in Cairo at this time, it is important to note that this does not constitute a complete overturning of the old regime.
Rather, if Egyptians are to proudly claim to be “revolutionaries,” one must see long term changes over time.
Yet there definitely is a sense of hope in the air for Egyptian youth. Though older generations are more pessimistic regarding the future because of their insistence that history will repeat itself, the younger generations feel more empowered and able to evoke change in these ever-turbulent times.
Ironically, while I was in Egypt, I felt more disconnected and hostile toward the revolt than when I was sitting in a classroom discussing it with my peers.
While experience is certainly a necessary part of any kind of growth, it is useless without reflection and the ability to share it with others.
It is uncommon for most people to think beyond the sphere of their immediate lives, much less ponder about Egypt’s political instability.
The first taste of my educational experience here at USC certainly gives me hope of a brighter future indeed — showing me that we will discuss and think critically about current global events.
Whether training freshmen to overcome the initial awkwardness of a new environment, or enlightening minds dulled by lazy summer days, the microseminars were certainly an experience.

Greek recruitment is a blur. By the time you’re thrust onto campus and given five days to check out your new surroundings, you are expected to know whether you want to join the incredibly large Greek community. Bluntly put, it’s too soon.
You’re expected to commit to something for your next four years within your first week of college. It’s too overwhelming with all the rush shirts, the sororities singing songs and the pre-rush parties (RIP).
The Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council should move rush week to the first week of September, in the best interest of the student body.
Freshmen need time to realize which house they like the best and which group of people they want to associate with for the rest of college. Coming into college, I was noncommittal about joining any fraternity.
I didn’t want to essentially force myself into a corner before I knew what was what.
Within three weeks, that all changed. I spent the rest of the semester vagabonding my way from party to party, counting down the days until spring rush.
Based on my experience, the university and the two Greek councils need to give potential rushees time to get their bearings straight and decide what’s best for them.
Last year the Greek community received a damaging blow. A social ban led to the effective shutdown of the Greek system.
The Greek community was in shambles, left to shamelessly trot out to the 9-0, begging for Nikias’ mercy in the following year. It was a very public struggle, and the events don’t need to be repeated.
But the skepticism still remains. Why would freshmen want to go through the pledging process if the Greek community experiences another social ban?
If freshmen got the chance to see The Row in action, with three solid and successful weeks under its belt, more of them would be keen on rushing and, more importantly, pledging.
While IFC and PHC don’t release numbers until after bids have been given, it’s not hard to envision a moderate decline in bids after last year’s events.
The USC community, Greek and non-Greek, would benefit from the postponement of rush. Starting rush a couple weeks later can prevent the immediate fragmentation of the student body into Greek and non-Greek communities.
Currently, USC is sharply divided between the two communities, with both sides negatively stereotyping the other. This leads to an unproductive and toxic atmosphere on campus.
Delaying rush will lead to a gradual acceptance between both sides.
Freshmen could make friends with each other without an affiliation and ideally remain friends even after joining different fraternities or abstaining from the process altogether.
This is not a proposal to turn the Greek community on its head. It’s just a proposal to alleviate the feeling that students are forced to immediately throw themselves into the daunting and large Greek community that some might not necessarily know too much about.

While I like the idea of delaying rush and it would work great for the IFC, it would be such a pain for the PHC because of dirty rushing rules. We’re already not allowed to talk to PNMs for the first week of classes, making us seem standoffish and rude, and if you extend that two more weeks, then those who don’t know what dirty rushing rules are/that they exist could easily get the impression that all Greek girls only talk to other Greek girls and are unfriendly. I know that’s not the truth, but it’s a tough line to walk. I personally hate not being able to introduce myself to new people or talk to anyone not wearing letters, and delaying recruitment a few more weeks would only strengthen the stereotype that all Greeks are insular and dismissive of all non-Greeks.
I don’t think there’s really a right time to rush at all–there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to every time, whether it’s before school starts, right when it starts, a few weeks later, beginning of the spring semester, or even fall of sophomore year. I guess it’s just about finding the least of all evils.
You know it’s true!
Glad to see this issue raised.  Three weeks into school may become difficult as it begins to interfere with the heart of fall semester classes.  I would like to see rush moved to the beginning of spring semester.  This gives everybody an entire semester to get to know each other and freshman the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the non-greek aspects of the university.  In addition, spring weekends are usually a little less hectic without football season.
Well written and right on target. Let’s hope the administration pays attention so that the Greek system at USC can continue to thrive.
Pre-rush was incredibly helpful when it allowed for 4 nights of consecutive open house parties – open to all students – giving freshmen and other rushing students the chance to see the different houses interacting in their natural environments while allowing rushees time to see more of The Row. This new policy by IFC and the University to curb drinking/parties/events has negatively created exactly what this article states: it forces potential new members to pick a house after only seeing them after a few days of blasé IFC-enforced events (i.e. everyone has to do a BBQ on the same night, etc.). These policies tend to hurt the smaller chapters the most because if rushees are only given a very limited amount of time to make the decision about joining a house, they are less likely to venture to the smaller and lesser known houses.
I assume that if rush were to be pushed out a few weeks, as the article recommends, that IFC and the University would keep The Row in a state of moratorium (no events, no booze, no girls, no ‘unfair advantage’ from one house to another) for those extra weeks – which really wouldn’t help people figure out what The Row is all about anyway.
I think this makes total sense, and I agree completely! A lot of other schools wait at least a couple weeks for rush, and I think it works out well.

To say Kobe Bryant wants to be great is an understatement. With him, great doesn’t cut it. He wants to be the best. He wants to be remembered in a pantheon with Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. It is this determination that has led to his bountiful success.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
In 2004, however, it also led to failure. Kobe reached too high and too fast. He saw another all-time great next to him in Shaquille O’Neal and decided the door to that basketball pantheon would only open if he approached it alone. He pushed Shaq and Phil Jackson out.
He put all the pressure to succeed firmly upon his own shoulders, molded a team that had just won three consecutive championships into a vehicle for his coronation.
He failed. Even a player as talented and driven as Kobe couldn’t take on the world by himself and win.
A lot of USC students succumb to a similar problem, albeit on an extremely less public stage. We might not feel pressure to be the best basketball players, but we feel pressure to become successful.
It might come from parents pushing us starting from a young age, from innate competitiveness or a search for validation, but it is that search for success or happiness that drives a lot of us. It is an entirely negative thought process.
Though we should encourage competitiveness and individual drive, there is a lot to be said for the value of teamwork — a quality that should take precedence.
Does following the specter of some promised land cause us to take on too much weight? I think so.
We overload with classes and commitments; stress, pressure and disappointments become expected.
In some areas, this cutthroat mentality is latently encouraged. In others, the encouragement is much more direct.
Somehow, if you aren’t pulling an all-nighter or studying for hours, you are not doing enough; you are falling behind. It borders on madness.
Do you remember when the Lakers sucked? A time when they missed the playoffs and finished behind the Clippers.
It was indeed a low point. Kobe tried to shoulder everything by himself and could only go so far.
It took some luck (the trade for Pau Gasol) and a lot of reconciliation (accepting Phil Jackson and Lamar Odom as invaluable aids) to allow him to pick himself back up and finally vindicate himself.
He stopped exerting all his energy trying to force himself to the top and instead strove to use his drive to help those around him, and lo and behold, as they rose, he was pushed up with them.
Yes, there are 6.7 billion people on earth all striving for the same success, climbing up the same mountain, pushing some out of the way, pulling the legs of those above them.
It seems that without Herculean effort, standing out in the “best” fields is impossible. Perhaps this is true. But perhaps we should not try to become the very best.
We should sacrifice our dreams of the summit to help that ocean of climbers rise a little higher collectively.
I’m not saying don’t strive for new heights. Quite the contrary, it is the strength of human ingenuity that has pulled us to where we are today.
We have descended from trees and risen to the moon. We are an amazing species for what we have done.
We should not waste the heights we have already reached by focusing our effort on the wrong things.
That summit, that top of the mountain, it doesn’t exist.
I think that mountain goes on farther than we can possibly imagine and, as clichéd as it sounds, we should find what makes us happy — what we are good at -— and use it to help those around us to climb up that steep mountainside along with us.

More than 100 people attended a service in memory of David Beeler, a Dept. of Public Safety security system engineer, at the Davidson Conference Center last Tuesday.
Safety · David Beeler is survived by his mother, wife and siblings. - Courtesy of Dept. Public Safety
Beeler, who designed and installed security infrastructure for more than 10 years with the DPS, died Aug. 3. He was 42.
The cause was medical issues, DPS Chief Carey Drayton said.
Beeler, who grew up a die-hard Trojan, was remembered for taking security breaches personally and quickly working to devise solutions.
“I will severely miss that,” Drayton said. “He always felt like faculty, staff and students were his primary focus.”
Many of Beeler’s colleagues at the university considered him family.
“Dave will always be part of the Trojan Family, but more importantly mine,” said DPS Director Carol Hayes, who was Beeler’s immediate supervisor.
Richard Tsung, senior computer consultant specialist, knew Beeler for seven years and remembers him as upbeat and thoughtful.
“He always seemed to genuinely care about what another person was doing,” Tsung said.
His mother, stepfather, wife and siblings all attended the memorial service. A service was also organized the Saturday prior at Calvary Chapel Beachside in Huntington Beach, Calif. where Beeler lived.
Before joining DPS, Beeler worked for Advanced Alarms, Inc. and served in the U.S. Army.
Daviee  was USC’s alarm and key security expert.  When he could not get the help he needed he would pick up a wrench and do it himself. When I have needed help in Facilities, Dave was one of the first people I’d call. For these reasons he will be missed!
We’ll miss you, Dave.

University Residential Student Community replaced its traditional Welcome Week foam pit party with a highlighter party to accommodate more students at one time and avoid technical issues brought on by the foam.
Enlightened · Students said they enjoyed the highlighter party because they could meet people by writing on them. URSC gave out highlighters and neon necklaces, which glowed under the blacklights they set up. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan
Students wore white shirts to the party, which still went from 9 p.m. to midnight Friday, and URSC handed out neon necklaces and highlighters for students to write on each other. Students’ shirts and drawings glowed under the blacklight.
URSC public relations coordinator Jennifer Lee said replacing the foam pit with a highlighter party made the event more accessible.
“There were some issues with keeping the foam pit fully inflated during the dance, which took away from the amount of time students had to dance in the pit,” Lee said. “To avoid long lines, URSC decided to go with a highlighter party where a large number of students could participate at the same time.”
Some freshmen who attended the dance said they had fun but thought a foam pit would have been more unique.
“It was fun but a foam party would have been cooler,” said Kaeli Lynam, a freshman majoring in international relations. “I’ve been to a lot of highlighter parties, but I’ve never been to a foam party.”
Still, most people seemed to enjoy how interactive the highlighter party was.
“It’s cool,” said Riley Scott, a freshman majoring in theatre. “It’s nice to meet people because they can sign your shirt and everything.”
Though hundreds of students attended the Welcome Week dance, some messages on the event’s Facebook page showed student discontent, including some who called Welcome Week “incomplete” without foam.
“What happened to [the] Foam Party,” Kiko Zang, a junior majoring in business, wrote on the Facebook event wall. “That was fun!”
Many attendees, however, were happy not to deal with the messiness of foam.
“[Foam] gets gross and wet,” said Kylee Lessard, a freshman majoring in communication. “You’d have to wear a swimsuit to go in it.”
Not all past attendees have been happy with their foam experiences either.
“I remember that the pool was too small and that it got really sticky and nasty,” said Srna Vlaho, a senior majoring in biological sciences. “I think the foam is fun but not very practical to getting people to go in or enjoy it.”
URSC said turnout at the highligher party was better than expected.
“We definitely had around the same, possibly more, attendees as in previous years,” Lee said. “The event was quite successful.”
And we still can’t party on the row?

West 27th Place on Figueroa Street is the first student housing complex to register for a Leadership in Energy Environmental Development platinum certification in the country.

LEED rates buildings based on the sustainability of the site, efficient use of water, use of energy and atmosphere, use of sustainable building materials and indoor environmental quality. Platinum is the highest level of certification a building can receive.
West 27th Place was carefully planned in advance to meet all of the standards for LEED certification, said David Hilliard, principal the of real estate firm Symphony Development. Walls were constructed off-site, delivered piece by piece like LEGOs and then assembled to minimize wood waste.
“While building, we were able to reduce up to 95 percent waste throughout the building’s construction,” Hilliard said.
Elevators are belt-driven, designed not only to be energy-efficient but also to generate electricity on the down stroke. The swimming pool on the third floor uses salt water instead of chlorinated water. All appliances are Energy Star-rated; no light bulbs are incandescent or fluorescent.
The apartment’s sustainability was a selling point, said Christine Rombouts, public relations representive for West 27th Place. Many students commented on the apartment’s Facebook page, expressing interest in the building’s sustainability.
“Students were really vocal on this,” Rombouts said. “They really care for sustainability. We were pleasantly surprised.”
Resident Ian Ritchey, a sophomore majoring in business administration, and Adam Maier, a sophomore majoring in animation and digital arts, said they heard about West 27th Place via word of mouth and were attracted by its sustainable quality.
“We grew up in cities [that were into the sustainability movement] so [sustainability] was a really important thing for us,” Ritchey said. “I was really impressed.”
Maier decided to live at West 27th Place because of the quality of the apartments in comparison to on- and off-campus housing options. He also enjoys the amenities West 27th Place offers, including the balconies, pool and courtyards.
“They have places that everybody can just come and congregate,” Maier said. “It’s not as isolated compared to other dorms or University Gateway.”
West 27th Place has its own separate bike storage room big enough to fit up to 325 bicycles — all part of a push for students to drive less, especially since the Community Redevelopment Agency plans to build bike lanes stretching from USC to downtown in 2013. Parking spaces are available, but priority is given to low-emission vehicles.
Despite West 27th Place’s heftier lease price compared to other on-campus housing, Hillard said every unit in the building except the model unit has been leased.
Units range from $1,500 a month for a small studio to $5,600 for a four-bedroom with a one-year lease.
A Five Guys Burger and Fries, a well-known East Coast burger chain, will also open a store in the building.
Minor point of clarification:  Salt water pools are still chlorine pools.  An electrolysis cell converts the salt in the water into chlorine.
I cannot wait till the University starts to build the new UV!

Phi Gamma Delta, also known as Fiji, received its official chapter charter from its international headquarters on Saturday and held an open house event Friday in celebration.
Although Fiji was started at USC in 1948, it closed its chapter in 2000 because of financial instability and returned to The Row in October 2009. Since then, Fiji has been nationally recognized as a colony, which is a probationary period before becoming an official chapter, said Austin Hay, former president of Fiji.
During this period, the members were not allowed to know some national Fiji rituals and secrets and were not permitted to put their Greek letters on their house.
“We weren’t able to be brothers in the strictest sense, and the legitimacy wasn’t there,” Hay said. “We weren’t allowed to have our letters on the house or wear the real pin.”
Bill Martin, executive director of Fiji International, noted the difficulty in moving from colony to fully accredited fraternity.
“It’s a challenge for every colony because you’re doing everything for the first time,” Hay said. “It takes extra energy and commitment.”
Martin said granting a charter is a reward for a colony’s hard work and indicates it is ready to become a full-fledged chapter.
Adam Laufer, president of  USC’s Fiji chapter, explained the charter will not change day-to-day operations of the fraternity, but it does provide Fiji with the privileges of  being full-fledged brothers of Fiji international.
“We’ve revived a chapter that started in 1948, and it’s very historical,” Martin said. “We’re pleased to be back at this particular institution.”
Hay said the occasion is particularly special for those who were part of Fiji’s first new pledge class in fall 2009.
“It’s a momentous occasion for us because it means a lot to the founding fathers who have been waiting for two years,” Hay said.
The process of returning to The Row and recruiting members has not been an easy one for Fiji members.
“One of the hardest things for us is making a name for ourselves on The Row and standing out to the point where we can recruit quality men to join,” Laufer said. “It’s hard being a new chapter because of how competitive it is, but as you grow it gets easier and easier every year.”
Tyson Beem, graduate advisor and former member of Fiji, commended the brothers for outstanding work despite the difficulties of being a new chapter.
“These guys have had to take on leadership roles because there weren’t any seniors when we started out,” Beem said. “They have phenomenal grades and put on great philanthropies, and they’ve made a good name for themselves on The Row.”
How are you hating on this, son? You don’t even have a house!
That’s all that needs to be said

John “Jack” Randolph Hubbard, eighth president of USC and U.S. Ambassador to India, died Sunday and was immediately remembered by colleagues and friends alike.
President C. L. Max Nikias announced Hubbard’s death at Salute to Troy on Sunday afternoon.
Hubbard served as president between 1970 and 1980.
Nikias said Hubbard was a true leader and a distinguished historian.
“He was a man of tremendous breadth and a champion of our faculty and students. We look forward to a celebration of his life and the legacy that has forever changed USC,” Nikias said in an email.
Hubbard came to USC in 1969 and served as vice president and provost for one year. In 1970 he was unanimously voted to succeed Norman H. Topping as university president.
During Hubbard’s tenure, the push to transform USC into an elite academic institution truly began.
Hubbard was known to have said, “It seemed, to me, that this would be a good time, strategically, to become aggressive as a university.”
This initiative propelled the grade point average for admitted freshmen to 3.4 on a 4.0 scale, began the construction of many major buildings and initiated programs with the surrounding community, promoting the inclusion of minority groups into the university.
Hubbard prided himself on having international connections. He formed relationships with schools in Asia and the Middle East to promote exchange programs between schools and set up many alumni clubs to connect the USC student body around the globe.
With the goal of transforming USC, he also launched the “Toward Century II” campaign, which raised more than $306 million in gifts and pledges and helped establish USC as one of the top 20 research universities in the United States.
Hubbard stepped down as president in 1980 and returned to teaching classes in history.
Steven Ross, former chair of the history department during Hubbard’s teaching years, said Hubbard was a unique character.
“Hubbard was an inspiring person as a teacher and as a human being,” Ross said. “He was one of the most dedicated teachers I have met.”
Prior to his appointment to USC, Hubbard served as chief education adviser for the International Development Agency missions in New Delhi from 1965 to 1969.
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed Hubbard the U.S. ambassador to India.
Hubbard joined the Navy during World War II and served as a naval aviation pilot. He was awarded four Air Medals and the rank of lieutenant commander for his outstanding service.
“Flying just came easy to me,” Hubbard said in a 1988 video interview.
In 2003, as a commemoration to Hubbard’s services to his country as well as the university, USC renamed the student services building John R. Hubbard Hall.
Aside from his passion for education, Hubbard had a deep-rooted love for USC athletics.
He used to send in football plays to then-coach John Robinson.
“The team might be able to fare reasonably well even without Hubbard to send in plays,” Robinson said.
Hubbard earned his bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in history from the University of Texas, was a professor of European history at Yale University and dean and associate professor of British and European history at Tulane University from 1953 to 1958.
Nikias said a memorial service for Hubbard will be held in October.
