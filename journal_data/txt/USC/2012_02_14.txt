Pac-12 Enterprises broke ground on the Pac-12 Studios headquarters in San Francisco on Tuesday.
The Pac-12 Networks, along with the Pac-12 Digital Network and Pac-12 Properties will operate out of the new facilities. Construction is scheduled for completion this summer.
The string of seven networks are scheduled to launch in August and to air more than 850 events annually, allotting more air time to women’s and Olympic sports. The Pac-12 network will be comprised of seven smaller networks: one for each of the six regions with two conference schools and one all-encompassing Pac-12 network.
Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Bright House Networks plan on carrying the new networks, the first time a college conference has launched a network on multiple platforms.
A new website portal, part of the Pac-12 Digital Network, will live stream events, making broadcasts accessible via smart phones.
“This represents another groundbreaking moment for a conference that is steeped in tradition and history,” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said. “There may be concrete at our feet, but the foundation for the Pac-12 Studios is being built on the success and excellence of our programs and our dynamic student-athletes.”

From entrance signs honoring the likes of Fred Lynn, Mark McGwire and Randy Johnson to the 12 national championship banners hanging so proudly as you step just a few feet inside the stadium to the Prior Plaza wall — which has 184 hanging plaques to commemorate every All-American and every major leaguer who has ever worn the cardinal and gold — it’s hard not to be reminded of the storied past that lies inside Dedeaux Field.
On Friday night, for the 39th time in the venue’s prestigious existence, the gates will once again open for local patrons and fans -— young and old. The lights will flicker on ever so slowly and a new season will be ushered in with the hopes of a long-awaited journey back to Omaha.
But the 2012 USC baseball team won’t be anything like the one that graced the field last year.
There are some familiar names, such as seniors Andrew Triggs (starting pitcher), Kevin Roundtree (catcher), Alex Sherrod (outfielder) and Brandon Garcia (pitcher/utility).
There are players on the rise, such as junior Adam Landecker (infielder), sophomore James Roberts (shortstop) and freshman Dante Flores (infield).
But on the surface, not a single player currently on second-year manager Frank Cruz’s roster looks to be the next immediate member of any Major League Baseball club or All-American team.
So how does a lackluster team try to restore the fading memories and once valued history of such a proud program after six seasons of dormancy?
Every player who toes the first base line before Friday’s game against Jacksonville understands what it means to don the USC emblem. They also know, however, that this is not their father’s — or even their grandfather’s — Trojan baseball program.
Since the Ian Kennedy-led squad that made the Super Regionals in 2005, the Trojans have not advanced to postseason play. They haven’t had a winning season and haven’t finished higher than fifth in the conference.
Once thought to be the dominant program in collegiate baseball, USC is not even among the elite in its own conference, as Stanford, ASU, Oregon State and UCLA have since become the only true World Series contenders from the Pac-12.
As bad as things have been in recent years, the baseball program at least had the luxury of showcasing one or two Major League-ready talents, whether it was Brad Boxberger, Grant Green, Anthony Vasquez or Ricky Oropesa.
Frankly, this team has more star power on its bench with former All-Americans Eric Munson and Gabe Alvarez on the coaching staff than they will on the field.
On talent alone, this might be the biggest question mark of a team the Trojans have fielded over the past seven years.
But this team also has something going for it that the previous futile squads didn’t have: They don’t have to compete with anyone but themselves.
“It’s not really about the past for us,” Roberts said. “We are not concerned with getting back to a place where other people outside of this program want us to be. It’s about right now with this team.”
Right now the conference views them as bottom feeders — a collection of seniors not good enough to be slotted as early round picks after their junior season, a bunch of young guys not talented enough to hack it at superior regional schools, a program where several top recruits typically bolt at the first chance to sign a major league contract.
Maybe this perception is accurate and then again maybe it’s not. Regardless, heading into a year in which there will be a complete reliance on the sum of its parts might just be the best recipe for success.
Without a star or any sort of widespread attention coming from outside the clubhouse, this team will be able to grow together in a distraction-free environment. They will, maybe for the first time since 2005, have a chance to come together as a team rather than as a collection of players driven by false expectations.
“Our chemistry is great right now heading into Friday,” Roberts said. “Everyone gets along and everyone is buying into Coach Cruz’s philosophy of making the guy next to them better. We have a good mix of older and younger guys, and so far, we mesh really well together.”
Being close, on and off the field, doesn’t necessarily translate to wins or regional appearances, but it’s definitely a great sign of the surprises this team may have in store for the non-believers or the disinterested.
When you look at it, the 2012 season is really a no-lose proposition for this year’s team. If they lose, no one will bat an eye. But if they somehow start to win and reinvigorate a sense of pride and dignity in a program that has lost its way in recent years, well, that could be a story that deserves a comfortable place on the walls of Dedeaux Field.

Fans and supporters like myself will not be satisfied or indifferent if team doesn’t improve enough from last season
and make the ncaa tournament. This program has such a great history and needs to return to being a top 25 team
at least season to season.

With two tournaments on each side of the country waiting, senior Steve Johnson has a busy week of tennis action ahead of him.
Ace · Steve Johnson is the defending NCAA singles champion. Led by Johnson, the Trojans have won three straight NCAA championships. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Before Johnson joins the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team in Virginia for the ITA National Team Indoor Championships, he is taking a shot at the singles draw in the SAP Open that started Monday and goes through Feb. 19 in San Jose, Calif.
Johnson’s fourth Association of Tennis Professionals competition will pit him against the likes of France’s Gael Monfils, American Andy Roddick and Canada’s Milos Raonic, who are seeded No. 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
On Monday night, Johnson participated in an exhibition doubles match alongside Monfils against John McEnroe, the 52-year-old tennis legend, and fellow American Jack Sock. McEnroe and Sock came out on top 6-4, 6-4 in the friendly.
Barring his advance to the latter stages of the San Jose tournament, Johnson will rejoin the undefeated Trojans in Virginia on Friday for the four-day  ITA Indoors tournament.
Johnson, the reigning NCAA singles champion, took the fall semester off to train as an amateur on the professional circuit.
He has played in several tournaments in the spring. He is currently ranked No. 365 in ATP singles and No. 191 in ATP doubles.
He most recently flew to Hawaii in late January to participate in the ATP Honolulu Challenger, where he lost in the first round 2-6, 4-6 to American Robby Ginepri.
In collegiate play, the ITA National Player of the Year and Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2011 currently has a 44-match winning streak in singles play dating back to March 2010.
He hopes to lead the Trojans to their fourth-consecutive NCAA team championship in April.

From 1959-2006, the USC men’s basketball team played its home games at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in Exposition Park, adjacent to the University Park Campus.
Rivals collide · At the Galen Center in January, UCLA defeated the Trojans by 19 points. The Trojans have won six games on the season and stands last in the conference, while UCLA is 14-11 and stands in seventh. The Trojans have just five regular season games left this year. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
But this season the Trojans’ crosstown rival, UCLA, has called the 52-year-old venue home, while its on-campus arena, Pauley Pavilion, undergoes renovations scheduled to be completed fall.
On Wednesday, USC (6-20, 1-12) will return to the Sports Arena for the first time in six years to face the Bruins.
“It’s an old building,” freshman guard Byron Wesley said. “I know it has a lot of history so I’m excited to play there.”
But that doesn’t mean it won’t be a little strange, either.
“It’s going to be a little weird with it being down the street,” Wesley said. “But we still have to go out there and play hard.”
Through 11 games this season at the Sports Arena, which is roughly 15 miles east of UCLA’s campus, the Bruins (14-11, 7-6) have gone 11-4. UCLA’s most recent game was a 73-63 home loss to first-place California.
But whatever struggles the Bruins have had this season pale in comparison to those of USC. Currently, the Trojans have lost 13 of their last 14 games and have won just once in the months of January and February.
Following Sunday’s 59-47 loss to Stanford, they have lost 20 games for the first time since the 1988-1989 season.
“There is no fun in losing — for anybody,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said following the 12-point loss to the Cardinal. “And there’s really no fun in losing ugly. I’m aware of all that. But what we need to do as a group is keep doing our job every single day.”
What has given the Trojans the most trouble this season is scoring. Currently, they average 53.3 points per game, which puts them 342nd out of 344 Division I teams.
Such scoring difficulties, as O’Neill is often quick to point, stem largely from the injuries of several starters, redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon, senior guard Jio Fontan and redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, that have left the Trojans with just six scholarship players healthy enough to play.
As a result, most starters are playing at least 30 minutes per game.
“All these guys are getting a great opportunity to prove what they can do,” O’Neill said. “The more they can prove what they can do, the bigger their role will be going forward.”
One of those players is Wesley, who ranks seventh among all Pac-12 freshmen in scoring with 8.1 points per game and fourth in rebounds at 4.8 per game.
“I love the way Byron Wesley has played,” O’Neill said. “I really do. He fights hard. Whatever these guys do will decide their role in the future.”
USC lost to UCLA earlier this season, 66-47, its sixth loss in a row at the time, at the Galen Center, where the Trojans made 18 of 50 field goal attempts.
Tip-off  will be at 7:30 p.m. and will be televised by Fox Sports Prime Ticket.

The USC Institute of Urology announced Tuesday that it received a $13.3-million donation to fund the institute’s USC Urology Robotics Center of Excellence and the Program for Prostrate Cancer Targeting.
Gift · The USC Institute of Urology, located in the Healthcare Consultation Center I, received a $13.3-million anonymous donation. - Photo courtesy of USC
The anonymous gift was presented at the Urology Vision 2012 meeting, held Feb. 7, which highlighted the institute’s progress and advances since Dr. Inderbir Gill, chairman of the USC Urology Institute, arrived at the institute in 2009.
President C. L. Max Nikias, who attended the event, said the gift will propel USC to be a global frontrunner in urology.
“Today the USC Institute of Urology is an internationally renowned powerhouse in robotic and open surgery. Tomorrow we look forward to being a cutting-edge comprehensive world leader in urology,” Nikias said. “Surgeries that were once considered fantasies are now a fact. Our Institute of Urology is helping redefine and reshape the field of urology.”
Gill said the institute focuses on the development and utilization of state-of-the-art technology.
“To be successful, you need a market differentiator,” he said. “A true market differentiator implies being the world’s best at a specific endeavor, which also drives your economic engine. You are lucky if you have one true market differentiator. USC urology has two: robotic kidney and prostate cancer surgery and open bladder cancer surgery.”
Since Gill’s arrival, the number of major urological surgeries and patient admissions has grown by more than 65 percent annually, having performed more than 2,500 bladder surgeries. Department collections also increased 65 percent between 2010 and 2012.
The department, which includes seven clinical sub-specialty centers, has 21 faculty physicians and researchers, 18 urology residents, 10 postgraduate fellows, five physician assistants and 29 staff members.
The institute received more than $3 million in research funding from the National Institute of Health in 2012, and was ranked No. 2 in the nation for urology. U.S. News & World Report ranked the institute 18th in the nation.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Saturday, Feb. 11, and Monday, Feb. 13. 

View Roundup 2-15 in a larger map
Crimes against a person
At 11:52 p.m. on Feb. 12, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a non-USC male and a non-USC female involved in a physical altercation near 7-11 and detained them for investigation. LAPD officers responded to take over the investigation, and the male was subsequently arrested.
At 6:16 p.m. on Feb. 11, a student reported that she was struck by a vehicle while riding her bicycle near 32nd and Figueroa streets and the driver left the scene without stopping to check on her welfare. The student sustained an injury to her side, but she declined when the officers offered to request an LAFD RA unit. LAPD officers were requested and they responded to conduct a traffic investigation.
Crimes Against Property
At 12:36 p.m. on Feb. 13, a student in University Gateway Apartments was detained by LAPD officers and subsequently transported to Harbor UCLA Medical Center for psychiatric evaluation after making threatening statements to another student.
At 6:20 p.m. on Feb. 12, a suspect approached a student who was walking near 23rd and Portland streets and, as he passed by her, he grabbed her wallet from her hand.  The suspect fled on foot and disappeared from sight. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
At 7:55 a.m. on Feb. 12, DPS officers responded to a report of a motor vehicle burglary having just occurred near Alpha Delta Pi and detained two suspects as they attempted to flee on foot. The officers recovered a laptop computer that one of the suspects had abandoned on the ground and, during questioning, the suspect said he removed it from a vehicle after the second suspect smashed one of its windows. Both suspects were arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 7:38 p.m. on Feb. 12, DPS officers detained five suspects who were observed loitering near 33rd and Figueroa streets and found one of them in possession of marijuana. The suspect was arrested, cited and released by LAPD officers who responded to the scene.  The remaining suspects were questioned and released.
At 4:17 P.m. on Feb. 12, DPS officers detained a juvenile who refused to comply when asked to leave campus after he was observed doing tricks on his skateboard at Charles Lee Powell Hall.  The juvenile was then transported to the DPS office and released to his mother after being advised that he would be arrested for trespassing if he returned to campus.
At 8:48 a.m. on Feb. 12, DPS officers referred a student in Tuscany Apartments to counseling at Student Affairs after she informed them that she was involved in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend and fears for her safety.
Hey thanks for the map as it clears up a lot of misconceptions about crime around SC.  It clearly shows that most of the crime is committed by Greeks on or near the Row just as I suspected.  I think DPS should do us all a favor and start naming the Frats so we know who to be most worried about.

USC’s student health care plan will adapt to new legislation, including President Barack Obama’s proposal to reduce the cost of copays and eliminate the cost of contraceptives, if passed.
On Friday, Obama announced a mandate in response to institutions that do not provide female employees with free contraceptives.
Health · President Barack Obama’s proposed legislation would only affect out-of-pocket costs for contraception, said Kari Trotter, director of UPC Pharmacy. - Ani Kolangnian | Daily Trojan
Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives and more than half of all women between the ages of 18 and 34 have struggled to afford it, according to the White House.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, a professor of pediatrics and medicine, said it is difficult to speculate on the outcome of Obama’s proposal.
“So much of the health care reform plan is up in air and not all is exactly firm as to what will happen when,” Neinstein said. “However, on the student side, we already comply with much of already passed health care reform.”
Kari Trotter Wall, director of the University Park Campus Pharmacy, said Obama’s proposed plan would only affect out-of-pocket costs.
“If a student is on a [non-USC] insurance plan that does not cover contraceptive care, they would benefit from the proposed mandate policy,” Wall said.
USC’s Student Health Insurance Plan is automatically applied to all students enrolled in six or more units, and to all international students and students at the Health Sciences Campus regardless of unit enrollment.
Students are eligible to use insurance companies not offered by the university only if it provides equivalent coverage and meets policy criteria.
Each USC student’s copay, or additional payment per medical expense, depends on that individual’s insurance provider and plan. Neinstein said if the legislation passes, all insurance rates will rise as benefits increase.
“These services are not subsidized by the federal or state government,” Neinstein said. “So this will be an interesting problem as increased services are required by health care reform. That issue is a national issue.”
Some students said the legislation would benefit them because they probably would not have to pay for USC’s insurance. Sruthi Pothireddy, a senior majoring in business administration, said she was disappointed the legislation is being proposed at the end of her college career.
“I’m an out-of-state student, and it’s mandatory that I enroll in the USC Student insurance policy with Aetna because my parents’ insurance could not be waved to cover the university requirements,” Reddy said. “It’s a bummer because I’m a senior, so even if it passes, it won’t affect me.”
As a woman, I know and rely on birth control on a daily basis.  I think it is none of the government’s business concerning what I do with my husband, when I do it, and why I do it.  They have no right to suggest married couples practice abstince. AH!
“Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives and more than half of all women between the ages of 18 and 34 have struggled to afford it, according to the White House.”
TARA-YOU ARE AN IDIOT.
YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THIS MADE UP STATISTIC?
WHAT KIND OF A “JOURNALIST” ARE YOU TO PARROT WHATEVER THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS RE: THIS ISSUE? 
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO LET SOME GUY USE YOUR BODY FOR HIS OWN SELFISH INTERESTS?
WHAT KIND OF GUYS DO YOU DATE ANYHOW?
ARE THEY INTERESTED IN YOU OR SOMETHING ELSE? IT”S SAD THAT SOME GIRLS WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALL ABOUT. ONLY GREEDY, SELFISH, LUST.
It’s better to do this, than to have another “dumpster” incident.
I think you totally missed the point of all the yelling that’s been going on the last few weeks. This was already part of the law — it was solely a question of what sort of religious exemption would be available that became such a big deal recently, as the bishops and beyond were waiting for an answer on that. As a non-religious school, this was never going to change one way or the other. 
…but hey, while we’re debating a year-old bill (or more, I don’t even remember), sure these services aren’t subsidized directly by federal and state governments, but with an expanded amount of people paying in, especially around our age group, the revenue should come in to pay for that level of service.

Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson and Dept. of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton held a meeting Tuesday regarding campus safety and health, addressing issues including student health concerns, crime near campus and DPS operations.
Safety first · Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson and Dept. of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton discussed Thursday at a forum in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center health and safety concerns. - Samuel Ham | Daily Trojan
Though crime has decreased over the last several years, student use of counseling services for mental health has increased since 2003 by more than 6,000 cases per year, and in the 2011 USC American College Health Association “National College Health Assessment Report” concerning graduate students, stress was reported as the top health concern affecting academic performance, Jackson said.
He said focusing on these and other health and safety problems will create a healthier community.
“Sometimes students are in crisis … our responsibility in Student Affairs is to resolve those crises,” Jackson said. “We’re concerned about supporting students in all their activities at USC.”
Claudio Tarchi, a freshman majoring in music industry, said handling stress is something students should cope with.
“USC is definitely a stressful place,” Tarchi said. “It should be on the student, though, to be responsible with their time.”
While Jackson primarily focused on student health, Drayton discussed the issue of crime on campus.
Drayton said, although crime has decreased since 2006, he hopes to reduce the current crime rate by continuing to implement DPS initiatives that make catching culprits easier.
DPS currently controls 72 video cameras, 49 license recognition cameras and more than 500 alarms across campus. DPS uses these tools in its campaign to “minimize the spaces,” which involves using DPS resources to reduce areas in which crime is possible to prevent law breaking before it even occurs, Drayton said.
Drayton said this pre-emptive strategy is more effective in reducing crime in the long term than responding to crime reports, and crime prevention should be a partnership between law enforcement and students.
“Safety and security is a shared responsibility,” Drayton said. “DPS has the responsibility to keep students safe — students have the responsibility to report potential problems to make officers’ jobs easier.”
Students had mixed feelings about the efforts of DPS and Student Affairs to keep students safe and satisfy their health needs. Riss Emond, a senior majoring in interdisciplinary studies, said USC seems more focused on increasing efficiency and improving academic performance than improving student health.
“The administration doesn’t appear to have the same interests as students in regards to safety,” Emond said. “The university is spending a lot of time and money chasing after stolen bikes, while bigger issues like sexual assaults sometimes go uninvestigated.”
Chris Gebert, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said it’s comforting seeing DPS on campus.
“DPS does a good job,” Gebert said. “It’s always nice when it’s late and you see a DPS car drive by.”
Jackson and Drayton said they are optimistic that their departments’ initiatives will make USC both safer and healthier for students.
“Victims of crime [at USC] have been steadily going down in the last several years,” Jackson said. “The key for me is that we create a community of respect.”

“I played saxophone from a young age,” says Princeton bassist and vocalist Matt Kivel. “I don’t know why. I kind of liked jazz music and you only have a limited number of instruments to play when you’re playing in school ensemble, so to me saxophone seemed really cool, like, the cool thing to do — so I did that.”
Kivel was fortunate enough to have other aspiring musicians within his family and group of friends growing up.
“Me and my brother obviously were around each other a lot growing up because we lived in the same house,” says Kivel, referring to his brother, guitarist and vocalist Jesse Kivel. “We thought it would be a good idea to start playing rock ‘n’ roll instruments. And [keyboardist Ben Usen] also grew up in our neighborhood and went to the same school with us. He was friends with us and he played piano, and we just thought that it would be nice to play some music together and make a band.”
In the years since then, Princeton has made a name for itself playing small shows during time abroad in London and supporting high-profile, indie acts like Vampire Weekend. The band has gained significant recognition for its dynamic live performances and sophisticated lyrics.
Princeton’s newest album, Remembrance of Things to Come, is set to release Feb. 21 and follows the band’s acclaimed debut, Cocoon of Love, which was released two years after the band members’ college graduation.
Remembrance shows off inspired new writing from Kivel and the rest of the band and marks a difference in the band’s formerly indie shoegaze sound. Kivel cites eclectic influences, such as As I Lay Dying and The Sound and the Fury by legendary author William Faulkner and various musical works by classical minimalists Steve Reich and Terry Riley.
“I think it’s like pop music, but there [were] a lot of orchestral instruments involved when we arranged the record,” Kivel says of the new album. “It’s densely rhythmic with minimal chord changes [and] these pop melodies over it so that it still sounds like a pop song.”
Over years of writing and playing music, Kivel has begun to feel a more emotional connection to his work, which has provided him with a sense of stability.
“I think playing music and writing songs over the last 10 years of my life has been one of the few consistent things that I just really get pleasure and joy out of and feel a sense of purpose,” Kivel says.
Although music brings him a sense of personal satisfaction, Kivel is rarely satisfied with the final product, often harboring mixed feelings toward his work.
“When I’m playing live, I wish I was recording something, and then when I’m recording something, I wish I was playing live,” Kivel says. “You have this vision of how something’s going to sound in your mind but regardless of whether you’re recording or live you never quite get there.”
The process of writing is as varied and challenging for Kivel, but it’s still something he relishes tremendously.
“Sometimes it involves just sitting with my guitar and working at an idea but sometimes it evolves. I tend to just write songs by playing chords on my guitar and then figuring out a vocal and then writing a lyric,” Kivel says. “As time went on, I got tired of the way guitar chords sound. So then I started writing [with] drum machines and keyboarding, even though I don’t play keyboard very well.”
Evolution is an important part of any band, and Kivel believes Princeton’s shift in style and influences is a natural result of time.
“As you get older, certain things that had meaning lose meaning, and things you overlooked become more valuable to you,” Kivel says.
This evolution will likely be paused, however, as Princeton hits the road in support of their newest release Remembrance.
“When you tour, your life becomes so simple,” Kivel says of the band’s new tour, which recently stopped at the Bootleg Bar in Los Angeles. “You literally have one goal for the entire day, which is to manage to drive to the destination and then to play the show at the destination.
“The bad part is that you can’t stay in shape,” Kivel adds with a sigh. “You eat terribly. You spend a lot of money. We all have jobs, so when we go on tour we have to put that income on hold.”
Kivel is largely unfazed by the downsides, however, and seems enthusiastic about life on the road.
“We get to see a lot of interesting parts of the country. We like to sightsee. We saw Mount Rushmore recently and we were obsessed with it,” Kivel says.
But in the end, it’s about the music. And on that front, Princeton appears to have a successful future ahead of it, fueled by passion and forged through strong relationships.
“As we got older, the idea of playing music together and the ambition to become musicians just stuck,” Kivel says. “I feel that when you have friendships like [this], it’s a special thing.”
[…] Friends grow as musicians “We thought it would be a good idea to start playing rock 'n' roll instruments.

There are days when nothing sounds better than a heaping bowl of pasta.
Perhaps you return home late from class, starving and in need of a quick meal. Or maybe you’re experiencing pangs of nostalgia for that old Italian restaurant you used to frequent with your family — you know, the place with the red-checkered tablecloths.
And then there are days when anything but pasta is your desired dinner option. Perhaps because it’s cheap and easy to cook, it’s the only thing you’ve eaten in weeks.
In either case, flavored pasta presents an exciting twist on the most familiar of pantry items. And fortunately for us, it’s suddenly everywhere.
One can typically find flavored pasta at farmers markets. That is where I have purchased ziti in an assortment of pea, carrot and beet flavors. The colors — green, yellow and rust red — are gorgeous, and the flavor is just as vibrant. Orange Szechuan spaghetti, or one made entirely from greens like spinach and basil, are other examples of what you might find.
The Original Farmers Market — insofar as you can call that a “farmers market” — is another place where flavored pasta can be purchased. Located in the center of the bustling bazaar is Pappardelle’s Pasta.
Pappardelle’s makes some of its pasta using Indian curry, others with sweet potato and lavender. They have roughly 50 flavors of linguine, fettucine and tagliatelle.
Maybe most intriguingly, Pappardelle’s makes a linguine with dark chocolate. If you’re hesitant about the taste, ask for a sample. You’ll be instructed to place a dry piece on your tongue, and in a few seconds an intense cocoa flavor will invade your mouth. “For dessert?” you might find yourself asking, only to be surprisingly instructed that chocolate pasta works well as an entrée.
It is an entrée, in fact, at Valentino restaurant. On some nights the Santa Monica institution features a pappardelle ai ciocolotto, a chocolate pasta that’s served with tomato sauce and lobster. I can’t vouch for the taste of this dish, but the fact that it exists is indicative of today’s demand for inventiveness in the simplest of foods.
Making pasta requires a mere two ingredients: flour and water. Home pasta machines start at as low as $50, and some are smaller than a toaster. And adding your own flavors to the dough, practicing kitchen improvisation as you go, is a fun activity. Cutting up and throwing in your favorite herbs is a smart, uncomplicated way to start.
But considering that pasta has been a humble dietary staple for centuries, this rise of flavored pasta begs the question: Why now? As gluten and carbs become an ever-evil force, the bane of every other health guru in the food world, pasta needs a new angle to seem appealing.
That’s exactly what flavored pasta provides: It’s hard not to appreciate a dish that’s not only simple to make, but comes with generous amounts of complex flavor. Additionally, the resurgence of locally made goods has welcomed a crop of pasta makers who are personalizing their creations with unique flavors and recipes.
This, then, might just be a pasta revolution.
Admittedly, the term “pasta revolution” comes from the latest issue of Cook’s Illustrated. It turns out Pasta Revolution is the name of the publication’s latest cookbook, but it also seems to be an apt name for this new advance of flavored pastas.
The timing also fits well in Los Angeles as the city waits for another outpost of Mario Batali’s New York hotspot Eataly. An Italian market and dining concept that feeds nearly 5,000 diners daily, Eataly is rumored to be coming to Los Angeles with a late 2012 debut.
However long it takes, the pasta revolution shouldn’t end until Eataly’s arrival.
OK, so the term is a bit dramatic. But as far as national movements go, a pasta-fueled one sounds too deliciously fun to resist.

In the dimly lit interior of an intimately small restaurant, anything is possible.
Modern dining · The Next Iron Chef contestant Andrew Kirschner’s Santa Monica restaurant, Tar & Roses, offers the perfect setting for dinner parties or a quick bite. - Photo courtesy of James and James Productions
At Tar & Roses, what will hopefully take place for eaters is a unique dining experience. The fledgling restaurant opened its doors to a flurry of customers its first weekend Jan. 24.
Andrew Kirschner’s Santa Monica locale prides itself on rustic fine dining. Formerly a chef at Wilshire Restaurant and a contestant on The Next Iron Chef, Kirschner has had quite a bit to prove with his new brainchild.
Whether or not he does is in the eye of the beholder, although some successes and shortcomings are more obvious than others. To start, the interior makes it difficult for you to walk away, even if the wait for seating is a lengthy one. Low ceilings, artsy light fixtures, an array of wine bottles and shelves full of goods like honeycomb welcome you and keep your eyes roaming. And if that isn’t enough, the food on the tables nearby can keep any eater’s curiosity piqued.
Most tables contain a wine glass and a wooden board replete with an array of intriguing options to start your meal. The appetizers are broken up into three sections: bruschetta, charcuterie and cheese. Each section has a long list of choices, and you can choose to mix and match three, five or seven items.
Between two people, the three item option is a satisfying beginning to the larger meal ahead. Under the bruschetta menu, the duck rillettes, prune jam and almonds option proves quite tasty.
The duck rillettes are thin, Lunchables-like slices that melt in your mouth and contain the right amount of flavor to keep you wanting more. The prune jam is sweet without being cloyingly so, and the almonds are the right type of crispy. Moreover, an extraordinarily sweet piece of honeycomb is included for daring eaters.
The wild boar option under the charcuterie is satisfying as well; the stringy meat is mixed with almonds between two crunchy pieces of bread spread with a sweet jam. One bite reveals a nice mix of flavors with an especially memorable smoky aftertaste.
Under the cheese section is a gorgonzola that isn’t necessarily spectacular but nevertheless complements the smokiness and sweetness of the other items. Not all the items on the list are offered at all times — the shaded-in boxes near the item names reveal eaters’ choices that are available that day — but the variety impresses. The combo is the restaurant’s strongest suit because it allows eaters to try bits of everything and keeps the meal interesting. It’s worth coming into the restaurant to order this mix and a glass of wine if you can.
The remainder of Tar & Roses’ menu fluctuates between intriguing to slightly bland. The menu is divided into sections titled Snacks, Small and Large. For a single diner, the small portions might be enough if paired with choices from the bruschetta, charcuterie and cheese sections, although a hungry diner might be left craving more.
On the more adventurous side of the small menu is a wood-fired duck egg that has just the right amount of salty. The accompanying stuffing comes in a hot ceramic bowl complete with a lid. Nicely fluffy, the stuffing provides a good accompaniment to the slightly watery egg. No bite of the sunny side up egg was ever really the same.
Unfortunately, not all the items on the small menu were as tantalizing. The bucatini was a small dish of thick noodles that unfortunately didn’t amaze. The noodles were mostly bland, and compared to the other items on the menu, this choice was much less intriguing and ultimately disappointing.
Additionally, most diners top off meals with a nice glass of wine, but the restaurant also offers a variety of specialty, non-alcoholic drinks along with regular and Mexican soda.
Overall, the restaurant’s menu items vary in strength, but it’s the starting items that make it a unique experience. Paired with the rustic, intimate interior of the restaurant, it’s perhaps these starters that will most set the restaurant apart from other Santa Monica eateries.
The restaurant experience changes when you come with more than a couple of people — the large items are more expensive probably because they are so delectable — but if you find yourself with only a few people and a semi-large appetite, sitting down to a glass of wine and your choice of meat and cheese isn’t too bad.

At Country Club Gallery on Sunset Boulevard, Patrick Ewing stands with his arm akimbo between two menacing German shepherds, while on the other side of the room, Roger Clemens gazes toward home plate with a steaming rocket in his hand where a baseball should be. Though Clemens and Ewing aren’t present in the flesh, they might as well be — designers John and Tock Costacos immortalized them in fantastical sports posters more than 20 years ago.
For The Kids is something of a retrospective showcase for the Costacos brothers and their iconic imagery that captured the imagination of a sports-centric 1980s.
Reminiscent · The Costacos brothers’ iconic sports posters encourage viewers to celebrate their childhood as the images feature 1980s and 1990s sports icons, such as Kenny Easley and Karl Malone. - James Violette | Daily Trojan
If you ask John Costacos where his career as a sports poster designer began, he may recount a moment in college when he was in the shower and heard Prince’s “Purple Rain” come on the radio. John Costacos was attending the University of Washington at a time when the Huskies football defense was unstoppable.
In a flash of inspiration, Prince’s “Purple Rain” became “Purple Reign,” which ended up on a T-shirt. John Costacos, along with brother Tock, eventually sold more than 25,000 T-shirts to Huskies fans.
“The best part about youthful entrepreneurs is that you are fearless because you see only the opportunities,” John Costacos said.
Building upon their initial success, the Costacos brothers began looking for their next big idea. Asking local sporting goods stores for desired, hard-to-find goods revealed a demand for a poster of the Seattle Seahawks safety Kenny Easley. Through a series of chance phone calls, John Costacos found himself at dinner with Kenny Easley pitching him a poster idea.
“[Easley] said he wasn’t interested in doing any posters because the way they wanted to portray him was just running down the field with a football or just standing there,” John Costacos said.
John Costacos had an entirely different idea in mind for Easley, one that involved a dark alley, a fog machine and a leather cutoff jacket; accordingly, the Costacos brothers’ first poster shows Easley standing in an ominously lit backstreet sandwiched between dynamic typography that reads “Kenny Easley” above and “The Enforcer” below.
If you didn’t know Easley, you might think you were looking at a movie poster for a low budget ’80s action film. If you did know him, your reaction to the poster would be closer to that of complete awe and an instant desire to get your hands on one. This specific aesthetic carries through the rest of the brothers’ work.
From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the Costacos brothers created dozens of posters that cast the biggest players in basketball, football and baseball into mythical proportions. In each poster, a player stands mightily in the foreground of a dreamlike setting; the players hold props that symbolize their identity in the context of their respective sport and pop- cultural standing.
“We weren’t really thinking so much about mixing [sports] with pop culture. I think we were hoping we could ride pop culture,” John Costacos said.
To magnify each persona further, the player in each poster is accompanied by a nickname known to the public or one created by the brothers: Karl Malone as “The Mailman,” Jim McMahon as “Mad Mac” and Jerry Rice as “Goldfinger.”
“[Posters] were the things that people hung in their room; they built shrines to look at their superheroes essentially. [The Costacos brothers] were creating these larger-than-life personas or caricatures for kids to absorb and obsess about,” said Adam Shopkorn, the exhibit curator at the Country Club Gallery.
The posters that were at one time created for bedroom walls are now being shown as works of art. Shopkorn organized the show for Salon 94 in New York and decided to see how it would fare on the West Coast.
“The real public that this hits hard have already downloaded all this stuff 25 years ago, and it has resonated with them. Now it takes on this element of nostalgia,” Shopkorn said. “What I didn’t realize before I did the show was how powerful nostalgia can be.”
Many visitors to the gallery were once kids who put the Costacos posters on their walls. Now, they’ve come to regain a piece of their youth.
“The show is titled For The Kids. When I spoke to John and Tock, they kept reiterating that they were doing it for the kids. They were making these posters for kids,” Shopkorn said.
For the Kids is an eccentric display of ’80s sports and pop culture that is captured in a one-of-a-kind aesthetic. The work of the Costacos brothers is a time capsule, making viewers yearn for an age where athletes were revered for their athleticism and larger-than-life personalities.
For John Costacos, the process of creating posters was a labor of love, and to see his work span the course of 25 years is nothing short of notable.
“It felt like we were a part of something. It was fun being connected with the sports leagues. It was really fun working with the players, and having been out of it for so long and feeling like there is some appreciation for it … is a really nice feeling,” John Costacos said.
 
For The Kids is on display at Country Club Gallery on 7561 Sunset Blvd. through March 4.

It’s the beginning of a long night inside Leavey Library and the text makes no sense. You need more help than Charlie Sheen, but you don’t know too many other students in your lecture, and tracking them down on Facebook would take longer than counting every granule of sand along the California coast. The professor posted the syllabus and holds office hours, but other than that, you have little interaction.
In short, your academic experience is isolated and limited.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
But the arrival of Coursekit will soon turn isolated and limited learning into invigorating and unlimited learning. Coursekit is a new academic platform through which instructors and students can interact online in a social, collaborative fashion. It’s a portable discussion at our fingertips. It presents the chance to learn from others, to teach others and to say hello to someone you met in class.
Founders Joseph Cohen, Dan Getelman and Jim Grandpre dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania to start Coursekit after securing a $1 million investment last spring.
Their decision is unconventional, but having swam upstream against academic culture, the founders are now poised to change it.
Higher education has been in need of a revolution since the arrival of social media changed the way we interact. The convenience and fluidity that Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn offer in sharing photos, résumés and quirky thoughts needs to make its way into higher education.
The social generation wants platforms where sharing is simple and continuous.
Blackboard is anything but social. For one, it’s practically anonymous: Students are only identified by names and emails. Professors don’t update it often enough. And its multimedia capabilities are limited and difficult to use.
Coursekit offers solutions to Blackboard’s problems. These solutions will not only increase the quality of our education, but they will do so through tools that are already familiar to millions of college students.
Videos from lab dissection, art samples from the girl a few rows behind you and study tips from the students who set the curve can all be shared and viewed with a simple click. A course calendar offers a clean and fresh alternative to student planners. You can live chat with the professor and other students; inquiring emails sent around a mysterious Listserv are superseded by instantaneous responses and tailored feedback. Facebook meets the classroom.
The greatest revolution Coureskit will precipitate is the redefinition of the student-teacher relationship.
The academic norm has been one where the professor lectures and the students take notes; interactions are usually one-on-one. But Coursekit presents a chance for each student to turn his proverbial chair toward the center of the circle and engage in a more communal learning space.
It’s time for Blackboard to step aside. With Coursekit, constructive interaction with others doesn’t stop when the discussion section ends.

In 2009, the American College Health Association reported that 40.6 percent of USC students have tried marijuana.
Medicinal marijuana has been legal in California since 1996.
In theory, medical marijuana laws only allow the people who need the drug to use it. Instead, this law has generated a complex web of problems. The medicinal marijuana industry, however, is surrounded by confusion and disorganization.
Marijuana has varied levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol — the psychoactive ingredient in the plant — pesticides, mold and bacteria. This range causes the distribution of medicinal marijuana to become a blind process. Possessing marijuana for testing is illegal; thus, there is no real system for quality control.
This approach makes no sense: Marijuana is a California government-approved medicine, but it is illegal to take any measures toward safeguarding patients who use it.
To make up for this conundrum, thousands of private entrepreneurs have sprouted up, offering to test marijuana for THC levels. The vast majority of these entrepreneurs have little scientific background. But the legitimate scientists among them are risking their reputations and careers to provide a safe system of testing to those who need it.
Three major labs — one located in Los Angeles — have grown in prominence and created the Association of California Cannabis Laboratories in an attempt to make the process more credible. But the labs need to be run in secret, lest the DEA shuts them down.
Legislators need to understand that they are endorsing marijuana as a viable medical product while crippling its use with their restrictive measures.
Legalization will allow well-run labs to stay running and prevent less-than-legitimate testers from running amok.
Whether or not you support the use of medicinal marijuana, it’s painfuly obvious that this law is illogical. Legislators are the only ones who can fix it.

Do a search for the documentary “In Pot We Trust” and watch. Then try to argue that there is no medical benefit. It is heartbreaking to watch the young mother worry about her ability to raise her daughter in a relatively normal manner that medical marijuana provides her.

Several student groups, ranging from the football team to USC Red Cross, have endorsed candidates running for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president.
The ticket of Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad received endorsements from the USC football team, Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, Sigma Chi fraternity and Trojan Knights.
“It highlights the balance between Greek and non-Greek [on our ticket],” Prasad said. “It also shows one of the strengths of our ticket in terms of improving athletics for all students.”
Presidential candidate Jared Ginsburg and his running mate Sam Coxe were endorsed by Global Business Brigades, Marshall Business Student Government, the Singapore Students Association, USC Chabad and USC College Republicans.
“It reflects that there is a very broad student base,” Ginsburg said. “The types of organizations that have endorsed us are very different from one another. I think it shows Sam and I are reaching out to a wide variety of students at USC and that was really the primary goal of the campaign.”
The ticket of Theo Offei and Julia Riley garnered official backing from the Black Business Student Association, Sigma Lamda Gamma sorority and USC Red Cross.
“They reflect excitement and, most importantly, they reflect diversity,” Offei said.
Student groups and organizations have until polls close Thursday night to endorse a ticket. Campus groups can endorse a candidate by filling out and submitting an endorsement form, which can be accessed on the USG website. The endorsement is then processed by USG and posted on its website.
Voting for USG elections began today and will last until Thursday. The preliminary results will be announced at a USG senate meeting Feb. 21 and the final tallies will be released the following week.

I completely agree! Quality control is very important! If its to serve a medical purpose then it must be regulated to ensure that it’s effective in treating the problem, not too weak, making it ineffective or too strong making the patient feel strong side effects that they may not be comfortable with.

The Panhellenic Council voted 6-4 Monday night to invite Alpha Gamma Delta to become the 11th Panhellenic sorority on campus.
Delegates representing each sorority chapter voted anonymously. Panhellenic Council  President Megan Lambert said Alpha Gamma Delta had some advantages.
“Both houses put a lot into their presentation. Alpha Gamma Delta just came out slightly stronger,” Lambert said. “[Their representatives] were very prepared. They had been at USC before so they had almunae here to help them, they had a lot of local support and … they really put a lot into their presentation.”
Lambert said Alpha Gamma Delta alumnae also own a house on The Row.
Alpha Gamma Delta is an international women’s fraternity that promotes academic excellence, philanthropic giving, leadership, personal development and sisterhood. Founded in 1904, it has 185 chapters at colleges across North America, with more than 160,000 initiated members internationally.
Initially established at USC in 1928, the Alpha Gamma Delta chapter at USC has been dormant. They still have a house at USC, however, that is currently rented out to Alpha Kappa Psi.
The decision to add a new sorority at USC began last year.
“The process started with an expansion exploration committee with a delegate from each house represented,” Lambert said.
Out of the three sororities that initially applied to form a chapter at USC, the council narrowed it down to two: Alpha Xi Delta and Alpha Gamma Delta.
The two sororities were invited to give a presentation and to conduct mock recruitment at USC. Approximately 200 delegates representing each house in the Panhellenic Council attended the mock recruitment and then met to give feedback.
A new Panhellenic sorority has not been added to campus since 2007, when Sigma Delta Tau established a chapter at USC, Lambert said.
“More and more girls are going to recruitment,” Lambert said. “We have some of the biggest chapters on the West Coast. There are a couple of houses with 230 to 250 members, which is too big. We felt a new sorority might alleviate some of those numbers.”
Lambert said, some members of the Panhellenic Council were concerned about the addition of a new sorority because there are some sororities that are not at a capacity of 150 girls.
“People were worried that a new sorority might bring more competition to those houses,” Lambert said. “There will be a big push in the next few years to make sure the smaller houses are up to total.”
Alpha Gamma Delta will be officially established in 2013 and will go through formal recruitment in 2014 so that smaller sororities can reach capacity.

The Beatles—“She’s Leaving Home”
The other songs on Sgt. Peppers, heavyweight singles like “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” and “A Day in the Life,” tend to steal the spotlight from “She’s Leaving Home.” Nevertheless this is perhaps the album’s most beautiful vignette. A girl escapes her home for love and adventure and meanwhile her stunned parents—begging, “Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly? / How could she do this to me?”—cannot understand what they did wrong.
They have done nothing wrong; but then neither has their daughter. Wonderfully, in “She’s Leaving Home,” as in the real world, no one is singularly culpable. Simply, inevitably, children must eventually leave home.
Slow Club—“Christmas T.V.” 
No—this is not a Christmas song. Or, at any rate, the story it tells, of lonely lovers loving each other from far away, is not some hokey Christmas tale. These are two realistic characters in a realistic relationship. They are scarred and scared and sometimes they argue, but eventually they make up, and finally they know that they give meaning to each other’s lives (“You pulled me out of the dark and now it’s light”).
The super-catchy chorus, “Let me come home,” signifies the song’s core metaphor, which is that being away from one’s love is like being in a foreign place. And by the same token, being with somebody feels like belonging somewhere.
Radical Face—“Welcome Home”
Despite the song’s thrilling chorus, “Welcome Home” is lyrically very sad, a love story in the past tense. The titular home is a house the narrator once shared with his now-ex-lover. As he looks around the house now he reflects on his past and, having suddenly lost a part of his whole, on his newfound incompleteness.
But the title is not ironic. “Welcome Home” empowers the newly single. It asks, and urges you to answer: How can you make a home now that you’re all on your own?
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros—“Home”
The song’s scarily infectious melody and its hippie-tinted warm-and-fuzzy lyrics (complete with a lubby-dubby dialogue about love and cigarettes chock in its middle) earned “Home” a prime spot last year on mix CDs across America. Some might argue that “Home” has worn out its welcome since last year, or even that the song has always been artless treacle, but never mind the humbugs. Once in a while you can afford to indulge your sweet tooth.
And on that note—Happy Valentine’s Day.

Last week, I talked about sound in film and video. This week, we’re going to examine lighting.
Lighting is a powerful force within videos and films. Lighting can add drama, embellish beauty or create a host of other effects. A character lit from behind can create an ominous silhouette, while soft light on someone’s face can enhance beauty. Natural and artificial lights also both have different qualities.
When shooting outside, natural light can be easy to use. The basic rule is to keep the light behind yourself while shooting—so that the light will be hitting your subject in the front, instead of the sun being behind your subject. Sunrise and sunset provides many different kinds of lighting, and the “magic hour” is always a good time to shoot. The “magic hour” is the hour after the sun has set in which the world is still illuminated. The light during this time is soft and gentle, and can be a beautiful time to shoot in.
If you’re interested in purchasing artificial lights, some inexpensive LED lights can simply be strapped to your camera or held by a friend. If you want to get more sophisticated, it’s good to learn about three-point lighting.
Three-point lighting is a fundamental lighting technique. It includes three lights—a key light, a fill light, and a backlight.
A key light is your main light source, shone directly on the subject. The fill light fills in the rest of the subject with a softer light. It comes from the front, opposite side as the key. And the backlight balances out the shot, and is placed behind the subject.
Lighting is a powerful cinematic technique that should always be kept in mind. Lighting can be the difference between an effective scene or video, and one that falls flat.
 Check back every Tuesday for Timothy’s latest techniques in filming.
