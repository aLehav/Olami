Natalie Laczewski | Daily TrojanTalking taboos · Muslim author, educator and reformer Irshad Manji urged the audience to ask her any questions they had about Islam.
Author of The Trouble with Islam Today Irshad Manji discussed the taboo questions of Islam and her views on the political strife regarding religion in conversation with USC Humanist Chaplain Bart Campolo at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Thursday evening. 
The conversation spanned not only forbidden questions about Islam, but also forbidden questions about religion and politics in general. Manji emphasized the importance of being receptive to other people’s ideas.
“Tonight is an experiment to see how honest are we willing to be in asking ourselves questions in what we believe, and why,” Manji said. “As in, ‘Is there something that I feel is so sacred that is so non-negotiable to me, that after all the negativity in the news, if someone asked me about it, I would be defensive to?’”
Manji discussed her own experience growing up and learning more about Islam. Some experiences, according to Manji, led her to realize not only the misjudgment of Islam by the rest of the world but the misjudgment of Islam by Muslims as well.
“Through self-study, I learned Islam had its own traditions of free inquiry; I came out of my experiences studying religion realizing I could be a believer of free inquiry and of Allah,” Manji said. “But recognizing that I could have both questions and faith made me complacent. I became unwilling to acknowledge problems in the actions of followers of my religion.”
Manji went on to specify what she believed to be the core of current issues surrounding Islam. Such issues, she realized over the course of her book tour, extended not only to Muslims but also to followers of other religions as well. At first, hearing her fans talk about other religions’ issues made Manji indignant, but gradually Manji began to learn from followers of her work. 
“Young Christians, Jews and even atheists would come up to me and say, ‘The message you have is important but you have to understand that this isn’t just the trouble with Islam today; the dogma and intolerance happens also in my religion,’ and I used to think that these people were saying that my entire thesis of the trouble with Islam is invalid,” Manji said. “My ego would make me defensive. But I began to listen.” 
From her followers, Manji learned about what she came to call “moral courage.” Recognizing the importance of moral courage, Manji began to change her own goals and missions. 
“These young people taught me three things that were really important: They taught me that speaking truth to power doesn’t just mean speaking truth to external power, it also means speaking truth to the power that is ego,” Manji said. 
For Manji, the second thing she learned from the young people she spoke to was the difference between those who criticize a work and those who offer constructive criticism. 
“When they shared with me the dogma in their own communities, they weren’t judging my own opinions about Islam, but they were rather opening up to me about their own experiences,” Manji said. “Finally, these kids taught me that actually, Islamic reform is not my mission; rather, the much more universal mission is what I have come to call moral courage. Moral courage, in its simple but not simplistic definition, means doing the right thing in the face of your fears.”
Following her explanation of her path to her current mindset following the publishing of The Trouble with Islam Today, Campolo asked Manji questions about her ideas about faith before opening up to the general audience. One of the questions asked Manji what specific problems she had with the practice of Islam today. Manji responded that while the majority of Muslims are not to blame for many of the terrorist attacks, she did not think that Muslims should feel completely innocent and only blame the rest of the world for their issues without looking within themselves first.
“My problem with Islam in its practice is the fact that we had thrown out the window this tradition of Ijtihad [which means free inquiry],” Manji said. “Instead of reminding ourselves that we have to take responsibility for some of the things happening to us, we instead are pointing fingers at everyone else.” 
Manji expressed her aversion to seeing the world in black and white for both outsiders and Muslims alike. She ended her talk with the idea that if Muslims hope to hold the world up to a higher standard, they must be hold themselves up to that same standard first. 
“I think that if my fellow Muslims want to have credibility, then we need to have our own different points of view at home,” Manji said. “If we’re stifling diverse thought within the Muslim community, we can’t preach to the rest of the world that we’re a diverse group, and we can’t expect the rest of the world to think of us as different individuals.”
Islam’s “Human Rights”
by Janet Tavakoli  •  November 5, 2016 at 5:00 am
No intelligent government should impair the right of free speech to placate people who falsely claim they are victims when often they are, in fact, aggressors.
To the 57 members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, however, all human rights must first be based on Islamic religious law, Sharia: whatever is inside Sharia is a human right, whatever is outside Sharia is not a human right.
Therefore, slavery or having sex with children or beating one’s wife, or calling rapes that do not have four witnesses adultery the punishment for which is death, or a woman officially having half the worth of a man, are all “human rights.”
Soft jihad includes rewriting history as with the UNESCO vote claiming that ancient Biblical monuments such as Rachel’s Tomb or the Cave of the Patriarchs are Islamic, when historically Islam did not even exist until the seventh century; migration to widen Islam (hijrah), as we are seeing now in Europe and Turkish threats to flood Germany with migrants; cultural penetration such as promoting Islam in school textbooks or tailoring curricula for “political correctness”; political and educational infiltration, as well as intimidation (soft jihad with the threat of hard jihad just underneath it).
More regrettable is that these are so often done, as at UNESCO, with the help and complicity of the West.
Both hard and soft jihad are how Islam historically has been able to overrun Persia, Turkey, Greece, Southern Spain, Portugal, all of North Africa, and all of Eastern Europe. It is up to us not to let this be done to us again.

Various keynote speakers and panels discussed the importance of sacred spaces like mosques, churches and temples, as well as the role of traditional elements such as clothing, on campus Thursday.
The event was hosted by the John A. Widtsoe Foundation, a Mormon religious and scholarly organization, and included opening remarks by USC Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni. 
During a panel discussion on the importance of sacred clothing, Aziza Hasan, the Founding Director of NewGround: A Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change, explained that clothing often serves as an agency of protection and safety, but can be turned into a barrier.
“One of the five pillars of Islam is to perform a pilgrimage, known as the hajj,” Hasan said. “Men and women are required to wear very specific clothing. Everyone is equal as the other, rich and poor, man and woman. It’s a leveler of society and a reminder that in the eyes of the almighty we are all the same.” 
Hasan also said that often, religious ceremony combines with the acquisition of finer goods. 
“During Ramadan, there is fasting sundown to sunset,” Hasan said. “You are not allowed to eat or drink anything. Coffee helps a lot, even more so do lavender and incense. During Ramadan you can see more individuals seeking lavender and pretty smells, so that they can focus on prayer at end of the day.” 
According to Hasan, therefore, obtaining decadent clothing or objects is a tradition that makes it possible for Muslims to partake in the experience. 
“All this access to beautiful resources comes down to relationships,” Hasan said.“When you think about buildings textiles, you want to think of how this is made and how it affects people and has big social impacts.”
Lori Meeks, an associate professor and chair of the School of Religion at USC, said that the creation of the physical parts interacted with during religious ceremony showcase how practitioners make faith a personal journey. 
“One thing that really struck me is that if we put sacred materials in context, we notice the contributions of others that don’t appear in the orthodox doctrinal texts,” Meeks said. “We can see the importance when we think about material aspects, how fabrics were made and so on.” 
Vinayak Bharne, an associate professor at the USC Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture, said that the idea of making faith personal can transcend tradition, making religion practical in the 21st century. 
“Hinduism has its own canons and rules and places for rules,” Bharne said. “What is beautiful is the more I encounter the entity, the more that I see they broke every single rule. Sacredness is very personal.”
For Hasan, this is why sacred spaces have become an important part of developing the faith of the individual, rather than just the select religious scholar. 
“It’s about ordinary people coming together to convene in sacred spaces,” Hasan said. “It’s very special. Sometimes, we defer to experts and to the elite, but creating spaces where everyone is an equal is important. It helps to build connection and support in the community, and is an important part of what people of faith can do together.” 
Bharne explained that individual sacred spaces can often manifest in what he called the “unintentional monument,” and that it is not necessarily religious. 
“If someone has passed away, the spot is marked with flowers and it becomes monumental for the family but not monumental,” Bharne said. “You feel so much for that place when you mark it. All the places I’ve visited that are converted to formal temples are designed to announce its presence, to let people know they are there. They are not personal all.” 
With the modern era offering more chances for interconnectivity and understanding, Bharne said that it is important to continue to investigate other belief systems in order to comprehend how religion defines perspectives. 
“The danger of not going behind the scenes is that we always tend to be outsiders,” Bharne said. “We look at the phenomenon from the outside, make our own experiences, tend to draw conclusions, and go away. We need to not be hasty, but take time to change our angle and take time to understand where they are coming from and how they perceive phenomenon.”

A viral outbreak that began in an on-campus residence hall last Wednesday has spread to off-campus housing, although the University says that the number of reported cases has decreased over time.
In a press conference on Thursday, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry offered more information on the source of the infection and the ways it has spread throughout the USC community. Although exact numbers are not available, LAist reported that the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has recorded 103 cases since Oct. 26. Carry said that the number of students coming to the Engemann Student Health Center has decreased each day since the start of the outbreak, but that there could be many students who have not reported symptoms.
“The outbreak started in New North, Marks and Pardee, but what we have seen is the numbers decreasing in those residential halls, and a trickling of incidents happening off campus,” Carry said. “We’re seeing more cases on the Row, and in the apartment complexes nearby. Students are mobile, they’re hanging out with their friends, and now we’re seeing more cases off campus.”
Carry also said that when the Engemann Student Health Center first began receiving a high volume of students with flu-like symptoms last week, USC worked with the health department to determine the cause of the outbreak. As a result, they ruled out the possibility that the disease was a food-borne illness, and dispelled rumors that the infection came from a residential dining hall. 
“Our health officials came into EVK the first thing following the outbreak and found that everything in EVK was done in top-notch hygiene — nothing was wrong with the cleaning procedures in the dining hall,” Carry said.
While Carry said that tests are still being conducted to determine the particular strain of the virus, LAist reported that according to the health department, the outbreak is currently being investigated as an incidence of norovirus, a type of gastrointestinal infection commonly known as the “winter vomiting disease.” 
Carry also offered options for students coping with the GI virus and discussed steps the University has undertaken to try to curb the outbreak.
“We have installed more hand-sanitizing stations across campus as well as in residence halls,” Carry said. “In our residential halls, we also now have the option for students to have their meals delivered to their rooms if they are not feeling well. If an off-campus student is on a meal plan in a reasonable distance, we’ll also be able to deliver. Our primary tool in dealing with virus outbreaks, however, is communicating with students.”
Carry also said that in affected residence halls, bathrooms are being cleaned every hour and employees are wearing gloves to minimize students’ possible contact with the virus. According to Carry, the main source of the rapid spread of the GI virus is the fact that students are not taking the precautions to keep themselves clean.
“Essentially, it’s passed by students touching each other, sharing items and not washing their hands,” Carry said. “For any of the flu viruses, our best advice is to isolate yourself, wash your hands, don’t share food and let the symptoms reside over 12-48 hours. So we’re asking students, if you’re feeling nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, isolate yourself, because when students stay isolated, they help keep the Trojan Family safe.”
On Wednesday, Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Michael Quick sent a memorandum to all USC faculty informing them of an outbreak of gastrointestinal virus on campus. Quick emphasized the importance of helping students make up missed work and providing resources for them to work on while absent.
“I am asking all of you to be aware that students may miss class due to this illness and to advise students in your classes to return to their residence halls if they are sick,” Quick wrote. “The recommendation is that students experiencing symptoms wait a full 24 hours after symptoms subside before returning to class or social activities. Please show consideration to students who have missed classes due to this illness.”

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanHold down the fort · Sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith leads the team in tackles with 55 this season. He also has six tackles for a loss. Smith missed last year’s game against the Ducks due to a knee injury.
After an undoubtedly successful October, the Trojan football team welcomes Oregon to the Coliseum for the first time since 2012, looking for their first victory against the Ducks at home since 2008. 
Head coach Clay Helton reiterated that the key to success against Oregon’s uptempo offense will be winning the third-down battle, getting the defense off the field and sustaining drives on offense. Though the offense has been racking up points for the Trojans lately, the defense expects to have their hands full as well, as they face the top rushing team in the conference. 
“Defensively, I think it is imperative to get pressure on this quarterback on third down,” Helton said. “If you don’t hit this kid, you’re going to have a long day.”
The Ducks’ freshman quarterback Justin Herbert became the first true freshman to start for Oregon since 1983 and he immediately stepped into the role. Herbert has thrown for 996 yards and 12 touchdowns this season. 
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast also has high praise for Herbert and has prepped his defense accordingly.
“I think he’s very talented,” Pendergast said. “I think they give him a lot, new wrinkles every week, and I’m sure they have some new stuff for us.”
Herbert has been helped by his running backs. Sophomore Tony Brooks-James and junior Royce Freeman have each rushed for over 550 yards and eight touchdowns this year. 
“When you see Oregon on tape, you just feel the speed,” Helton said. “Without question over the last seven years I’ve been here, they’ve always been the fastest team we play …  It’s always been a trademark [for them].”
The Ducks have found success with the two-back system so far this year.
“When you look at Royce Freeman and Tony Brooks-James, you’re talking about two different types of backs but two dynamic kids that are putting up 248 yards a game,” Helton said. “With Royce, 5.6 yards a carry, and then they put Tony in and Tony is ultra-dangerous. The kid’s averaging 8.6 a carry, and every time he touches the ball you hold your breath.”
An advantage that the Trojan defense has this year that they didn’t have in last year’s lackluster 48-28 loss in Eugene is sophomore linebacker Cameron Smith. Smith missed last year’s contest because of a knee injury but has been playing at full speed this year.
“It was rough, but I’m ready to play them,” Smith said. “It should be a fun one.”
Smith leads the team with 55 total tackles including 32 solo tackles. He also has six tackles for loss and one sack. Smith has forced one fumble as well as recovered one fumble. Helton described him as the rock of the defense.
Similarly, the offense has its own unsung heroes — the offensive line. It has allowed one or fewer sacks on average in the last six games despite allowing multiple sacks in the first two weeks. Giving up only nine sacks this season, USC leads the Pac-12 and is 12th in the nation.
The performance of the offensive line has allowed both the run and pass game to flourish. Last week’s 398 rushing yards were the most for the Trojans since 2005, but this week will prove a challenge without all of their top backs. Senior running back Justin Davis participated in practice Wednesday but was limited to straight ahead running, and sophomore Aca’Cedric Ware missed practice due to a sprained ankle. The top back will be sophomore Ronald Jones II, who has started the past two weeks. He has run for 529 yards and three touchdowns this year.
Redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, who has continued to dazzle with his play, is expecting a lot of similar schemes and coverages from Oregon as he saw against Cal and is feeling confident heading into the game, and rightfully so. Against Cal, Darnold torched the Bears for 231 yards and five touchdowns.
“After watching the Utah game on film, I realized how much time I actually had in the pocket … and I think that’s really helped me,” Darnold said.
The game is a special one as it is Homecoming weekend for USC. It is also the last time the Trojans and Ducks will meet until 2019. The game kicks off at 4 p.m. and will be televised on ESPN.

Emily Smith | Daily TrojanBack with a vengeance · After redshirting last season due to injury, redshirt senior Katie Johnson has not missed a beat, bolstering the Trojans’ frontline. She is tied for second on the team with in goals with seven.
The No. 5 Trojans are reaching the end of the road, with only one more game left before the regular season ends and the journey to the NCAA championship begins. And this season will end with a rivalry, as the team takes on UCLA at the Stubhub Center on Friday.
It’s a high-stakes matchup to finish on. The Bruins, ranked No. 18 in the country and sixth in Pac-12, stumbled late in the season in back-to-back road games. But with freshman midfielder Jessie Fleming — a starter for the Canadian national team — and a well-spread offense finding steady success throughout the year, the team has proved that they can bring the heat.
And Friday night, two games will decide the winner of the Pac-12 Tournament. Trailing Stanford by 2 points, the Trojans must win no matter what. But if Stanford falls or ties in their game against Cal, the Trojans will take home their first Pac-12 Championship title in program history.
No matter how the night goes, head coach Keidane McAlpine feels confident in his team. 
“I think they’re right where they need to be,” McAlpine said. “This whole season has felt like we’ve come together at the right time. We’ve learned and adapted and had our growing moments at the right time.”
It’s been a showstopper season for the Trojans, with conference and national accolades pouring in from the first week of play. Defensively, redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme has reshaped her backline into a stalwart wall that holds off attacking forwards ranked in the top echelons of the nation.
They started young and shaky, with Prudhomme and senior Mandy Freeman struggling to wrangle a squad of freshmen and sophomores with a lack of chemistry. The team gave up four goals in two games to kick off the year, with both losses coming unexpectedly to unranked programs meant to serve as exhibition matches.
In the past, the Trojans lived and died by their backline. But at the start of the season, McAlpine made it clear — this year, that wouldn’t be the case. 
In many ways, that was true. With redshirt senior Katie Johnson returning from an injury and multiple transfers adding depth, the Trojans’ frontline found its rhythm. Eleven players found the back of the net, with redshirt junior Alex Anthony leading with nine goals, and Johnson and senior Morgan Andrews following with seven apiece.
The offensive onslaught almost overshadowed a sudden and definitive transformation on defense. Prudhomme and her line shut out Pepperdine, then Georgia and Auburn on the road. 
The team strung together eight shutouts before Oregon finally snuck a goal in during a 3-1 road win for the Trojans. In total, the defense earned 12 shutouts through 18 games. Prudhomme was only scored on six times.
Last year, the Trojans boasted a similar level of defensive fortitude while struggling to finish on the attack. This year, it hasn’t been an issue at all — and it’s this balance of play that is bolstering the Trojans’ confidence as they begin to look ahead to championship play.
“I think you can see the confidence just in the way they’re playing [and] the way they’re coming into every game,” McAlpine said. “We’ve seen the pieces start to come together throughout the season but now, this is really where we have to lock in and play our ball and see if we have what it takes to make our mark nationally.”

There are times when sports are amazing, like when a team that hasn’t won a championship in 108 years finally breaks the drought and the viral video of an 81-year-old Cubs fan jumping for joy makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. Then, there are times when sports are sad and unfortunate and make you realize all of life’s cruelties — just ask Max Browne.
The redshirt junior quarterback’s time at USC is winding down, and the clock probably couldn’t move faster for him. In a span of 10 weeks, Browne has gone from USC’s next heralded quarterback to an underperforming backup to a frustrated soldier looking to transfer and salvage his final season of eligibility.
He had more than paid his dues to earn the starting job. Coming out of Skyline High School in Washington, Browne was one of the top quarterback recruits in the country. Analysts compared him to Peyton Manning. He had 11 other offers from schools ranging from Oklahoma to Alabama, yet he chose USC knowing that he would be competing with then-redshirt sophomores Cody Kessler and Max Wittek for the starting job.
“As a quarterback growing up on the West Coast, at least for me personally, there was always the dream of growing up and being the quarterback for the Trojans,” he said to the Seattle Times after committing to USC in December of 2012.
He probably didn’t anticipate having to wait four years for that dream to come true. He lost out to Kessler as a true freshman, and was redshirted. The following year, when Steve Sarkisian took over as head coach, Browne still could not beat Kessler for the starting job.
He dutifully backed up Kessler last season in No. 6’s final year at USC. So with Kessler out of the picture, 2016 was finally supposed to be the once prized recruit’s time to shine.
But then a monster in Alabama popped up on the schedule as the season opener, and Browne and the Trojans looked lost against the defending national champions. And there was Stanford waiting in Palo Alto in Week 3, where the offense looked stale and lackluster. Oh, and there was redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, a springy, dual-threat, dynamic quarterback who does nearly everything that Browne can’t.
So staring down at a 1-2 record, an upcoming road game at Utah and his seat getting hotter by the second, head coach Clay Helton played the one asset in his back pocket: the quarterback card, swapping Browne for an unproven redshirt freshman. Darnold, in turn, has responded with incredible stats and crowd-dazzling plays to provide a much-needed spark to the Trojans’ season — and saving Helton’s job while at it. 
But Helton’s job security and Darnold’s rising star comes at Browne’s expense, and that hurts. Browne was the consummate professional, the loyal team player waiting for his chance. But at the first sign of trouble, he was flung to the side. It is hardly fair to judge what he would’ve done in a full season based on a three-game sample size, especially considering two of those games were against superior talent in Alabama and — at the time — a confident Pac-12 powerhouse in Stanford. 
“I look back on a few of those routes [against Stanford] and you’re kicking yourself a little bit, because that’s kind of what I’ve made my money on out here,” Browne said, trying to rationalize why he lost the starting job. 
Nonetheless, even the most ardent Browne supporters will admit Helton made the right call. Darnold is doing incredible things — single-handedly leading USC back into the Pac-12 South race — and the Trojans don’t have to worry about quarterback competitions for the next three years.
What’s frustrating is that nobody did anything wrong here. Helton has been rightfully criticized for a number of decisions, but I’m not faulting him for giving the loyal Browne his long-awaited shot at quarterback, trusting that Browne’s talent as a former star recruit and his familiarity with the offense would outweigh the untapped potential in Darnold — despite the redshirt freshman impressing during both spring and fall camps. If my job was on the line, and I knew I had a wild card and potential lifesaver in Darnold, I would play that card 10 times out of 10. 
Likewise, no one can fault Darnold for seizing the day and putting any quarterback concerns to rest by starting his career 4-1.
So now, Browne is left searching for playing time somewhere else — literally anywhere else.
“I made sure my headline said ‘all NCAA schools’ for a reason: I’m willing to go anywhere,” Browne said after practice on Wednesday. “That was the case out of high school, and it’s no different, if not more emphasized, now.”
It’s sad because the past four years at USC have done nothing to advance Browne’s football aspirations — if anything, they’ve made them worse. He has to play the recruiting game all over again, and if he wants playing time in his final season of eligibility, he probably won’t end up at a marquee program like USC.
To be fair, the blame also falls on him. He had several chances to win the starting job, but Kessler was just better. When he finally did, he nearly lost — and eventually did lose — the position to a redshirt freshman. He could’ve made a much better first impression against Alabama, or could’ve hit the receivers he missed against Stanford. Perhaps he just isn’t as good as his recruiting status hyped him to be, or perhaps three years without regular game reps had a negative effect on him.
But it all comes back to circumstance: If USC had started the season against three easy opponents, would Browne still be the quarterback? Instead, when Oregon visits the Coliseum on Saturday for Homecoming, fans will be singing the praises of Darnold, while Browne will be hardly noticeable, relegated to the sideline. Just a reminder that for every Cinderella story, there’s a hard-luck loser — ask the Indians, or ask Max Browne.

The fact of the matter is that Max Browne was over rated coming out of Highschool. A five star recruit would have beaten
out Cody Kessler for the starting job back then. He is not suited for the new wide open offenses predominant in today’s game.
Great piece, but the headline is misleading and incorrect.

This week, I’m talking about a recent failure in my love life. Yes, friends, some of the greatest lessons come from failure — and I am not shy to say that I have had my fair share of defeat.
A couple of months ago, I was hanging out at a local Starbucks, doing the regular coffee run so I don’t kill anyone. You know how some people say they get “hangry” if they don’t eat food: hungry plus angry, cute right? Well, yeah. When I don’t drink coffee, I get “where the hell is my freakin’ coffee?!” I digress. I clearly haven’t my cup today.
So as I wait for my coffee, I stand by the pick-up area, and as a law-abiding citizen (well, that’s a lie, I’m Australian — more like law-abiding, legal non-resident alien as my mail from the U.S. Government likes to label me), I make sure I follow all signs whether the signs are on the road or if they are in stores. Looking up at this “pick up here” sign, I decided to fulfil my obligation and proceed to “pick up.” 
Standing next to me was this gorgeous girl. She had a great smile and an amazing fashion taste, so I smiled at her and dropped the least creepy and totally charming line I had in my arsenal.
“Nice furry keychain. Mind if I pet it?” I asked.
If you remember from the get-go of this article, I did say that this was a story of failure. However, friends, this horrible encounter is not where I failed. Quite the opposite, actually. But do not be dismayed, failure does come eventually. 
This girl and I hit it off alright, but not enough to really warrant a natural exchange of numbers. Too many times I have seen people be really pushy for what’s called a “number-close,” and I’m not really about that. Besides, I was already getting distracted by the smell of my coffee. I thanked her for letting me pet her keychain, and I told her it was nice to meet her.
A week later, I was up late and really couldn’t sleep. So, naturally I was on this mobile phone app that connects you with people around your area, maybe some of you have heard about it? Counting people by swiping left and right is the new form of counting sheep if you can’t sleep. 
I got a match with this oddly familiar-looking girl, and we were having a really great and meaningful emoji battle when it finally hit me.
“WAIT. IS THAT U?! Furry keychain girl?” I messaged her.
“OMG, [laughing and crying emoji]. YOU’RE THAT GUY!” she responded.
There are three Fs that I live by — fate, fun and FIRE. For me, it’s not a good romance unless there’s some fate with the person, the other person’s fun and of course, the other person is FIYAH (inside and out).
I took her out that weekend to the most L.A. thing you could do. I had this hookup at this art gallery, not open to the public, in this redecorated and restored industrial warehouse in downtown Los Angeles. The gallery had a DJ, free drinks, some finger foods and some good vibes.
She was awesome and filled all the requirements I had on my ideal partner list. She was fun, down-to-earth and pretty freakin’ artsy. Oh, but there was this one problem though … Just a slight one. She never responded to my text messages after what I thought was a great date night. I was ghosted, pretty bloody hard.
There’s the failure I was talking about.
I was pretty confused about it for a while. But looking back on that interaction, I realized that although it seemed like we had really good chemistry, a lot of it was actually kind of one-sided (namely, from me). Here was this person that I had some sort of inkling would be a great partner. However, for some reason, I was just not a good enough potential partner for her to continue exploring the relationship. Actually, her ghosting me was not a complete blindside. During our date, she talked a little about what her ideal type was — some of the features included being patient, put-together, mature and driven. And if I’m honest, I guess I still have a lot of room to grow in those departments. 
This furry keychain girl helped me realize something. As a love columnist, I have a lot of questions that come up here and there to me. A lot of them start to have a pretty similar echo. To give a few examples: “How do I find the one? How do I know if she’s the one?” “How do I reach and not settle?” and “Where are all the good ones out there?”
Valid questions. But they all have to do with the other potential partner, and less to do with ourselves. With all this dialogue going on about “the other,” it’s easy to get ourselves tricked into thinking that love is about finding the person you were meant to be with. It’s all about finding the one.
Yet here I was, after a few years of failed flings and relationships, and waiting around for someone to show up on my doorstep. I was thinking I had found maybe not “the one,” but at the very least a potential partner to explore a relationship with. I wasn’t what she was looking for, though. And it was kind of weird to me — all this time waiting, and this moment was here, but I just wasn’t ready for the moment.
And that brings me to some love advice that I want to share with you all today. Here’s a harsh question obscured by this awkward tongue twister: friend, are you “the one” that “the one you are looking for” is looking for? We spend so much of our time and energy and resources on discovering the person we were meant to be with, but we spend so little of our efforts on discovering the person we were meant to be. 
I find that a lot of our dialogue is on other people reaching our standards or how to know if someone is right for you. Honestly, I think it’s much easier that way. It becomes about other people being good enough for us. But when was the last time that we tried to look within and become better people ourselves? What would it look like if we stopped passively waiting, looking outward for someone to come along, and in the meantime started working on our own temperament and insecurities and faults? I think you’ll find yourself with a much better chance at not only locking down that person, but also having a fruitful and amazing relationship.

Photo from Taste TalksIn line for the food · Taste Talks starts off with famous chef Roy Choi’s Commissary breakfast burrito at The Line Hotel’s Garden. Chef Louis Tikaram will also explain the different types of curries and the art of curry making.
For all the restaurant connoisseurs and Food Network gurus that are upset DineLA is over, have no fear. Taste Talks, a national food conference, is coming to various locations throughout Los Angeles this weekend for three days of panels, parties, networking events, interviews and of course, delicious food. 
Taste Talks began as a food industry leadership conference and barbecue in Brooklyn. It acted as a place for up-and-coming chefs to come together to spark discussion and new ideas. Taste Talks quickly gained popularity, hosting weekends of the conference in both Chicago and Los Angeles. From there, Taste Talks evolved into an online editorial platform that now features videos, interviews and articles from food industry celebrities and influencers, all with the goal of creating innovative dialogues about food and culture. 
The Los Angeles festival kicks off on Friday, with the Opening Kelis’ Arepa & Agave Party at Hotel Normandie, which will feature a wide variety of Colombian arepas as well as tequila cocktails. The conference kicks off the following day at The Line Hotel, starting with a brunch at The Line Hotel garden. Then attendees can attend a wide variety of panels, demonstrations and discussions such as “Angelenos Eating Well: A Chat with Wes Avila and Snacky Tunes,” a discussion on “The Globalization of Dining,” and “A Dessert Demo and Discussion With Alma” at The Standard’s Ari Taymor. 
After the conference is the Mother of Pearl Chef Dinner at The Unique Space in Downtown Los Angeles. The dinner will feature a multi-course meal from Los Angeles’ top chefs, including Kelis and Julian Hoyos Vallejo from Tres Bastardos in Colombia, Jesse Barber from Dudley Market in Venice, Brett Halfpap from Belcampo in Santa Monica, Valerie Gordon of Valerie Confections and Robyn Sue Fisher of Smitten Ice Cream, along with wines from Jackson Family Wines. 
As Taste Talks rolls into Sunday, attendees get to experience the signature All-Star BBQ at Mack Sennett Studios. The BBQ will feature live music, with artists like The Glitch Mob, Rick Ross, Kitten and more. The barbecue will also feature some of the most innovative BBQ creations, including veri veri teriyaki chicken sausage with grilled pineapple from Chef Jude Parra of The Cannibal, Deconstructed pork Haitian style from Chefs Ron Duprat and Manouschka Guerrier, and 72-Hour Short Rib Steak from Chef Eric Klein.
Closing out Taste Talks Sunday night is a final industry party also taking place at Mack Sennett Studios. After the BBQ, attendees can mingle with some of the country’s best chefs and taste some delicious tapas courtesy of Badmaash and Delicious Pizza. 
Different ticket tiers are available for the weekend, such as single event passes for the Mother of Pearl Dinner and All-Star BBQ; a conference pass, which includes brunch; a “food enthusiast” pass, which has access to the conference as well as brunch and the All-Star BBQ; and the “kitchen sink” pass, which is an all-access pass to the entire festival. Tickets can be purchased online.

Photo from Paramount PicturesHere to stay · In the highly anticipated science fiction film, Louise (Amy Adams) is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve.
Films come and go often, and audiences move on quickly from one film to the next without much thought. Rarely does a film completely shock, unexpectedly impress and profoundly move audiences. This is the case for the 2016 science fiction film Arrival.
Arrival tells the story of a linguistics professor, Louise (Amy Adams), whose expertise gets her entangled in the race to uncover a new alien species that appeared in 12 ships across the globe. She is led by Col. Weber (Forest Whitaker) and teamed up with physics scholar Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to discover the aliens’ purpose for coming to Earth. The film is directed by Dennis Villenueve, who previously helmed the critically acclaimed Prisoners and Sicario.
In its most superficial form, Arrival seems like an unoriginal story featuring an alien invasion and humanities effort to preserve the Earth, a story that has been told several times before. This, however, is not true. The film is indeed about another life form coming to Earth, but the plot reveals a much more intimate, human story. It is a story about communication and the power of togetherness. It is less a spectacle of action and more a character-driven narrative.
One of the film’s most incredible aspects was its outstanding but subtle performances. Adams shines in the starring role, providing a heartwarming foundation for the film. Renner plays alongside with Adams, but it is clear that Adams steals the spotlight. Additionally, Whitaker walks the line between a serious colonel and comic relief successfully. While her counterparts Renner and Whitaker do a fine job in the film, it is Adams holds the attention of the audience throughout the 116-minute running time. 
With the exception of a slightly slow and muddled introductory sequence, the pace of the film is brisk, and the plot flows well. Villenueve does an outstanding job to hold the tension and suspense across the film’s many scenes. He effortlessly blends scenes together, intertwining visuals and creating more and more tension until the climax is reached. His pacing and visual storytelling has remained unstoppable since his previous feats. Villenueve, however, could not have been able to present this impressive work to audiences  without the help of masterful screenwriter Eric Heisserer.
Heisserer’s script drives the film, providing a multi layered story. It is unbelievable how much emotion Heisserer is able to convey in a science-fiction film featuring aliens and the government. The story is largely under wraps for the majority of the film, and with the assistance of Villenueve’s powerful vision and attention to detail, Heisserer’s script comes to life in an amazing way. Heisserer is able to write a script that subverts cliches and reworks them to create something original and thought-provoking, an incredibly difficult feat.
The visual aspect of the film was additionally laudable because of the work done by the cinematographer, Bradford Young. Young does a phenomenal job to shape Arrival tonally and keep with the ominous yet intriguing mood of the film. His dark and faded color use conveys the tired and stressed attitudes of the characters seeking to solve the dilemma.
As if the film could not have any more redeeming qualities, Arrival features a chilling score that captures the emotion of each scene. Jóhann Jóhannsson, who scored both Prisoners and Sicario, returns to work with Villenueve for the third time. Jóhannsson’s work. It creates an immersive environment for the audience of the film. 
Arrival is the rare film that breaks expectations and shocks audiences. Through its smart marketing, it cloaks an incredibly compelling, must-see story. It is a near-perfect film that is sure to linger long after the credits roll. With an unexpected plot, direction and score, as well as an outstanding lead performance by Adams, Arrival establishes itself as one of the best films of the year and perhaps the most original science-fiction film in the past decade. The film arrives in theaters Nov. 11.

Photo from Diner en BlancThe art of fine dining · Guests will be able to experience the glamour and elegance of French high society, all in the presence of company from varying backgrounds in one of the nation’s most diverse cities.
On Nov. 4, Los Angeles will host its third annual Diner en Blanc. The magical dinner party, where attendees must dress in all white, takes place in a public location that is not revealed until just minutes prior to the dinner. The past two L.A. dinner locations were Rodeo Drive and Pershing Square. Over 2,000 guests are expected to attend this year’s Diner en Blanc, all anticipating an evening of elegance and amazement.
“We are so excited to be back in Los Angeles, a city that truly revels in beauty, one of a kind epicurean events and top tier culinary experiences,” said Annette Dalloo, the director of the Los Angeles Diner en Blanc. “Angelenos will not be disappointed by this year’s top-secret location as the backdrop for an evening filled with music, excitement and an amazing celebrity chef.”
After registering for the event, guests are assigned to an initial meeting location. There, they will be led by a Diner en Blanc volunteer to the actual dinner location, where groups from across the city will converge spectacularly at one of Los Angeles’s chic public spaces. The evening will be filled with food, celebration, music and dancing. The first Le Diner en Blanc of Los Angeles was held in 2013, yet the pop-up dinners began in France nearly three decades ago. Launched by chef Francois Pasquier with just a few friends in attendance, Le Diner en Blanc de Paris now hosts over 10,000 guest each year. Some of France’s most historic and prestigious sites have hosted the events, including the Eiffel Tower, the Chateau de Versailles and The Louvre Pyramid. 
Guests must bring their own gourmet picnic basket, chairs, table and table setting. The table, chairs and tablecloth must be white, as per tradition. The picnic basket must be filled with fine food, white dinnerware and proper stemware. Nevertheless, a catered picnic basket option is available, ready to be picked up on site. The evening will be filled with traditional yet spectacular moments, such as the waving of a cloth napkin to commence dinner and the lighting of sparklers to signal that guests are free to mingle and dance. At the end of the evening, the sound of a trumpet indicates that guests should pack up all of their belongings, pick up their trash and vacate the location, leaving behind no trace of the night of festivity.
But the night does not end there — Diner en Blanc will host an after party at SPEAR Steak and Seafood. Tickets grant priority access to the after party, storage for picnic items and two drinks. The after party will run from 11 p.m. until 1:30 a.m. It will provide an opportunity to meet those who made the event possible as well as a space to continue to mingle with other guests, marking the conclusion of the the extraordinary evening.

For all those who are beginning to tune out from the presidential election after weeks of disappointment, maybe this is a good time to bring up something a bit more closer to home — something a bit more personally relevant.
As students, we’ve probably all been hit with that question, “What’s your goal or vision in life?” Whether it’s from mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, sober friend, not-sober friend, interviewee or stranger, we’ve also probably had plenty of moments when the answer was a sheepish “I don’t know” or, for the lucky ones, a fluent explanation of a planned career path.
Both are great answers. If you’re in the “I don’t know” crowd, join the club, we have jackets. If you’re in the other group — well, good for you. But a recent statistic from the National Center for Education cited that 80 percent of students in the United States end up changing their major at least once and that on average, students change their major at least three times over the course of their college career. So what does this mean, other than that students are in a phase of discovering themselves? Although the idea “students change their majors often” isn’t causative to “students don’t know what vision is,” the statistic does kindle some thought for entertaining a possible connection between the two. Especially as more and more people respond to the question, “What is your vision and purpose in life?” with the name of a career, perhaps we’ve forgotten what it means to possess a vision. In fact, when “what to major in,” “what to study” and “what career to choose” become the only significant factors that define “vision,” it may drift us even further from going back to the basic meaning of a life purpose.
As the day to day tasks of life demand constant attention, we often forget what the difference between career and vision is. But think for a moment: At what point did a career become the same thing as one’s life purpose? A career is an occupation. Vision differs from a goal in both function and effect. To slightly modify an original quote by C.S. Lewis: Vision is unnecessary, like philosophy or art. It has no survival value; rather it’s one of those things that give value to survival. Without vision, the pursuit of happiness becomes a purely utilitarian exercise — one that devolves into a theatrical bragging competition of life-trophies while engaged in bitter brinkmanship.
As we pursue our “happiness,” we must remember to include all the things that give happiness true meaning. When someone asks you what your vision is, it should be more than just a career goal. Purpose in life fuels the drive for success but seeking after success in and of itself will prove to be empty.
In the end, the reason we often prioritize having a vision is to make sure we have purpose, because when we have a purpose to live, it gives capacity for happiness. The original Latin root for “passion” is pati-, meaning “to suffer”. It makes sense. As many of us go about establishing goals and pursuing dreams, our passions are things for which we’re willing to suffer. As we decide on careers and major life choices, it’s time to remember the end of all our means: passion, success and vision.

Three thousand dollars in student debt is accrued every second in the United States, and the average total amount by the time students graduate is about $37,000. In the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign, and among other divisive issues like immigration reform or taxes, a pressing issue rests in the minds of many college students and their families — college loan debt. 
As it stands, 40 million people together have $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, and with the price of college tuition continuing to rise, the number of graduates unable to repay their loans is expected to increase. In fact, the cost of attending a higher education institution in the United States has increased by 757 percent from 1980 to 2009, which is almost five times the percentage amount that food and electricity costs have risen within the same time period. The discussion of student loan debt tends to focus on graduates of four-year universities, when in reality the vast majority of borrowers that have difficulty repaying their loans attend community colleges or for-profit universities. While the two major parties’ presidential candidates have addressed these concerns with varying policies, they do have one thing in common: Both rely on the federal government to provide aid. However, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s plan will be most effective in reducing student debt.
Sen. Bernie Sanders garnered the support of millions of students and their parents who are struggling to pay off student loans by making the issue of loan debt central to his campaign. In response to the issue coming to the forefront of this election, Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have been forced to solicit their solutions to this mounting problem. Both candidates propose using the federal government to decrease student loan debt, but utilize two very different methods to do so. Clinton’s idea of using federal funding to encourage states to increase their financial support for public universities starkly contrasts to Trump’s proposal of threatening funding cuts to decrease administrative costs to pass savings onto students. Given Clinton’s additional proposals of expecting students to work and financial penalties for universities that do not decrease costs and tuition, Clinton’s overall plan is the best solution to help reduce student loan debt.
While Trump does not have as detailed of a plan as Clinton, both use the federal government to reduce funding if universities fail to trim costs. However, Trump’s idea primarily focuses on universities cutting administrative costs. For example, Trump plans to threaten to end the tax-free endowments that colleges receive if they are unable to reduce costs. According to policy analyst Mark Huelsman, Trump’s idea of threatening universities to reduce costs without other substantive complementary proposals misdiagnoses the root causes of student loan debt. As Huelsman asserts, Trump, unlike Clinton, has not indicated additional plans to incentivize states to more fully financially support their universities. Thus, Trump’s solution largely ignores that the decline in state government support is one of the biggest factors in the increase of student loan debt; if public state universities are unable to offer their students financial aid packages or reduce the costs of tuition, the students are forced to take out loans to cover the cost. 
Clinton’s additional proposal of expecting students to work a certain number of hours per week in addition to offering states more funding to help support students aims to solve the issue of high student loan debt from multiple angles. However, similar to the Obama administration’s difficulty regarding their health care initiative, the success of Clinton’s plan depends on how well it is executed: Often times, by trying to decrease the financial costs for students, similar programs have shown to give too much money to state universities and going over the proposed budget, or underfunding the schools and failing to reach the proposal’s goal of helping students.
Ultimately, both Trump’s and Clinton’s ideas for decreasing student loan debt deal with greater federal intervention into the funding of state public universities. Trump’s main proposal seeks to threaten colleges to reduce costs and “administrative bloat,” and use the power of the federal government to force schools to eliminate tuition increases. Trump’s plan only half-heartedly serves to address the root causes. by ignoring the underlying causes of increasing student loan debt, such as the decline in the amount of funding states are able to give to public universities. By increasing federal funding to states that support public universities, as well as requiring students to work part time to increase their personal funding sources, Clinton’s plan to reduce student loans addresses more of the root causes of the problem.

“Federal intervention” means that taxpayers cover your debt or other government services are eroded to free up the money to cover your debt.  Behind every student loan is a contract.  The signatories knew what they were contracting for and must abide by the terms.  Welching on a contract is unethical and should expose the creditor to legal challenge. Don’t go thru life assuming that your monetary debts are disposable.  To all students with loans – be accountable and responsible.  And don’t make commitments that you can’t fulfill.

When Michaela Grobbel asked a room of people in Taper Hall to describe what they noticed about a portrait of Ceija Stojka, people immediately began to point out that she had numbers on her arms. 
Those numbers were tattooed onto her after she first arrived in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Stojka was a member of the Romani, a group of people persecuted by the Nazis and killed by the thousands due to their minority status. The artist, writer and musician had three separate stays in concentration camps, and her art reflects the memories of her time there during her childhood. 
Grobbel, a professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at Sonoma State University, visited campus on Thursday to speak about Stojka’s life and the impact of her work on the modern world. The event, “Memory Paintings by Romani Artist Ceija Stojka,” was hosted by the German Studies Program at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Grobbel said that Stojka’s paintings are her attempt to bridge the gap between her Romani identity and the dominant culture of Austria, her home country. Stojka struggled as an activist to educate the greater European public about the Romani culture through her art. Much of the Romani culture, which would have been passed on from the older to the younger generation, was lost after a quarter of the Romani people were killed during World War II. 
“How many people really know Romani? Are friends with them? Are family of Romani?” Grobbel asked. “I believe very few, and that is why stereotypes keep flourishing.” 
Grobbel said these stereotypes of the Romani people being gypsies and thieves persist all throughout Europe, and have led to intense discrimination. As a result, large numbers of Romani have been deported from France, Italy, Germany and other European countries to what is supposedly their “home” countries. Grobbel said the Romani people have also suffered systematic discrimination, including a lack of healthcare and education and forced evictions. 
This kind of discrimination is exactly what Stojka experienced and attempted to address in her paintings, Grobbel said. Her family was greatly affected by World War II and Hitler’s occupation of Austria. Stojka saw and felt how the Romani were being depicted and represented through the media. 
“Anywhere I am, I paint in my head,” Grobbel said, quoting Stojka. “And anytime, when it is time, I remember, and then the memory gets transferred to paper. It lands somewhere.” 
Within her art, Stojka intertwines words and images. Each painting is signed with the numbers tattooed on Stojka’s arm, as Grobbel said Stojka was unafraid to identify herself as a survivor and speak about her experiences. 
“The Romani people rely on artists and other people like Stojka to talk about the past and keep the Roma culture alive” Grobel said.

You won’t find Lavonna Lewis at a Trader Joe’s. It’s not because she is morally opposed to food samples, or that she has problem with their extensive supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. In fact, she would probably prefer if most markets had similarly healthy and accessible options.  But when Trader Joe’s officials basically told Lavonna that they weren’t interested in having a Los Angeles store east of La Brea, they lost her patronage.
Trader Joe’s unwillingness to join the larger community may seem insignificant, but their hesitancy to leave West LA encapsulates many of the food policy issues present not only in Southern California, but throughout the country. 
It is in food policy that Professor Lewis, a 20 year USC faculty member with a Ph.D in Political Science and a Masters in Public Health, focuses her efforts. She and her team are concerned with expanding access to healthy, affordable food options in neighborhoods where it’s easier to buy a burger than a banana. In public discourse, these areas are referred to as ‘food deserts.’
“Basically, ‘food desert’ is saying that within a walking distance, people don’t have access to quality, affordable, healthy food options, whether that’s fruits and vegetables that they can prepare themselves, or maybe healthier options that might be available in a sit-down restaurant versus a fast food restaurant,” Lewis told me when we sat down for coffee last Friday. “In a food desert, it’s not easy for people to make the healthy choice.”
The USDA’s original definition for food deserts is as follows: “Low-income areas where a significant number or share of residents is far from a supermarket, where ‘“far”’ is more than 1 mile in urban areas and more than 10 miles in rural areas.” The map below shows the regions, highlighted in green, that meet this definition, according to 2010 census data.

It’s easy to understand why proximity to healthy food options is such an important factor in making food purchasing decisions. Especially in low-income areas, where a greater proportion of people need to work many hours at low wages in order to make a living, dragging oneself to the market after a long day can be a tall order. When there’s a McDonald’s right around the corner with cheeseburgers on the dollar menu, it’s no wonder that people often opt for the cheaper, easier, and less healthful option.
But these dietary decisions have consequences. We know that black communities in LA county have significantly higher rates of obesity and diabetes than white neighborhoods, so it should come as no surprise that food deserts are generally concentrated in communities of color. Lack of access to healthful food is a systemic issue, connected with legacies of racism and displacement, disproportionately affecting low-income racial minorities.
“If you think about health from basically before you’re born, prenatal care until end of life care, lack of access [to healthful food] has consequences,” Lewis said. “If certain foods or vitamins are necessary for healthy development, and you don’t get those resources, you’re already at a disadvantage. And without intervention, disadvantage will persist over your lifetime.”
Rising rates of obesity and diabetes have been at the forefront of public health discussions for the past decade. But if our resources are spent on medical care post-diagnosis, we miss the opportunity to address the root causes of the diabetes epidemic.  According to Professor Lewis, “The focus around access to healthy foods is really around this idea of prevention. That’s why people are doing what they call ‘moving upstream.’ So rather than a doctor treating your diabetes, you move further upstream to find out what it is about your community that might put you at greater risk for diabetes and try to arrest that.”
Yet for some reason, while diabetes and obesity have enjoyed the spotlight as part of national awareness campaigns, food justice has remained in obscurity — a concern of policymakers, largely ignored by the public and the media. It’s not a very sexy topic, not very well suited for our reality television election cycle. Furthermore, food access seems like a problem with an easy solution: you don’t have access to fruits and vegetables? Build a grocery store! Easy!
If only it were that simple. An analogy: In the education system, schools are financially rewarded for high performance. Education funding quickly becomes cyclical, because school improvement can usually be tied to increases in funding. The well-performing schools get better, and the poorly-performing schools are never given the chance to improve.
Food access is an analogous problem — residents in a food desert forgo healthy food options (because they aren’t available), and businesses use consumer purchasing decisions as justification for not supplying healthy options. After all, no one would spend on kale! “I know for a fact that the Ralphs down the street (Vermont and Adams) doesn’t make available as many organic fruits and veggies when [USC students] are gone then it does normally,” Lewis said.
But this is fallacious thinking, in education as in food policy. How can you adequately measure demand when supply is limited to fast food restaurants and liquor stores?  The only way to accurately measure interest in healthful food options is to provide them to a community and then study consumption patterns once there is a greater variance in available fresh fruits and vegetables. But even getting fruits and veggies into a community can pose a challenge.
One such obstacle encountered by Professor Lewis in her study of food deserts? Advertising. “What’s being promoted before you ever open the door?” Lewis and her team asked markets and restaurants to understand which items were offered as part of dining specials. “Are they promoting fruits and vegetables or they promoting liquor? Are they promoting the super size entreé, or are they promoting a new salad?”
They found that in low access communities, it was the unhealthy choices that were generally on display. It’s not that these businesses are evil, peddling poison to their friends and neighbors. But businesses, particularly in low-income neighborhoods, are always vulnerable, operating on very thin profit margins. “If I know that I’m in a community where people smoke, then I want people to know I’ve got cheap cigarettes,” Professor Lewis said. It’s the same for food. Because residents of food deserts don’t spend on fresh fruits and vegetables, vendors don’t want to provide them for fear of missing their bottom line. “They’re just kind of reinforcing unhealthy choices.”
For this reason, Lewis will try to meet businesses halfway. She lives in the communities where her research is conducted, and understands the struggle. Her job as a policy maker and community influencer is to “get people to recognize the consequences of continuing to promote bad choices and get them to say, ‘Okay, we will keep one beer ad and then add some healthy options.’”
And it’s not just about altruism. While an appeal to community is one way of getting markets and restaurants to alter their available food options, there is also a strong economic incentive. “We are talking to the people in the community, and they are telling us that if [local businesses] bring something healthier, they are gonna buy it,” Professor Lewis said. “[Consumers] are leaving the community to buy [healthy foods], so it’s like resources are kind of leaking out of the community.”
Working with grocery stores and markets is just one way Lewis and others of the food justice movement are hoping to alleviate low access to quality nutrition. Other important solutions include: farmer’s markets, pop-up markets, community gardens, and store redesigns (e.g. turning a liquor store into a fresh produce market). The key idea is to give people as many ways as possible to make the healthy choice; do enough, and it becomes the easy choice.
While expanding food access is the top priority and ultimate goal of Lewis and her team, there are still important, intermediary steps that they are taking in the meantime. On the local level, this can mean a moratorium on the construction of stand alone fast-food restaurants, like the one enacted in 2008 in South Los Angeles. In recent years, the efficacy of this policy has been questioned, as obesity rates continued to rise. But still, it is a necessary part of improving access to healthful food. It is, of course, not enough to just curtail bad dietary options; they need to be replaced with nutritional alternatives, and without this second part of the equation it should not be surprising that the problem persists. Poor access to healthful food didn’t develop overnight, and it won’t be solved overnight either.
Visibility for the food justice movement, and an increased awareness for the problem is another key step. “Healthcare providers [residing in West LA] who have patients in South LA may have no idea what their patients are going through when they ask them to change their diet,” Lewis told me. “The physician gets frustrated because the patient isn’t following orders, and the patient is frustrated because the physician has no idea what life is like when he leaves his office.” There’s definitely a disconnect between healthcare providers and patients when it comes to dietary changes; educating physicians about the difficulty for many patients in adopting new behaviors can go a long way in improving holistic medical care.
Even more than that, spreading awareness will help dispel the myth that bad choices are made by bad people. “Just telling someone to do something without a real appreciation for their context leaves you to blame people for making bad choices,” Lewis said. “They may be bad choices, but they were the only choices that I had to make, and I will eat, I will not starve.”
And there is the heart of the problem. Why should we care about food policy? It can be difficult for people who have never worried about food access to understand the necessity of making drastic, systemic chances as soon as possible. But the essence of food justice, what makes it an urgent, pressing issue, is the simple fact that we need food to survive. Unlike physical exercise, eating is not a discretionary activity. We all have to eat, and we should all be able to make informed decisions about what we put in our bodies. 
I asked Professor Lewis if policy and regulation was the only viable means of solving the problem of food access. “I think when we don’t know what’s going to work, we are very happy letting people try to do things voluntarily, figuring out what works,” she told me. “But if over time we find out something is working better than anything else, you can’t justify not doing it anymore.”
It may be bad taste to respond to an article that has been written about me, but I wanted to tell Kevin in a public space that I appreciate how well he captured our conversation and the issue of food justice more broadly-thank you.

Image courtesy of Chinecherem EzeGirl power · USC junior Chinecherem Eze uses her foundation and skincare line to empower and educate black girls and women in Nigeria.
A USC junior has qualified as one of the contestants for the Miss Africa USA contest, a beauty pageant dedicated to African girls in America.
Chinecherem Eze, a student majoring in political science, was born in eastern Nigeria and came to the United States in 2013. On Nov. 5, she will travel to Washington, D.C. to participate in the pageant, which was launched in Atlanta in 2005.
Eze said that she is very passionate about Africa, and one of her biggest inspirations for joining the beauty pageant is that she wants to make use of the platform to become a voice for black women.
“I advocate for natural beauty,” Eze said. “I emphasize black women being comfortable in their skin and loving themselves in their skin. We don’t have to change the color of our skin to look beautiful.”
Eze created a skincare line called Skin Afrique in January in order to discourage black women from bleaching their skin to look lighter. She said she wants to take a stand against the fact that society defines darker-skinned women as less beautiful than women with lighter skin.
“Black is beautiful, black is powerful and being black is simply magical,” Eze said.
In March 2015, Eze started the Chinecherem Eze Foundation, a nonprofit, to support black female business owners through resources such as grants and to provide education for black girls in her native country of Nigeria.
“Sometimes what stops a child in Africa from going to school could be as little as $5,” Eze said. “This is why is goal of sending more African children to school is so dear to me. I want children to live their dreams, because they are the future of Africa.”
So far, the foundation has been able to pay for five kids’ tuitions for one year, and now she hopes to send up to 50 kids to school by the end of next year.
“I hope to extend my foundation to more African countries and not just my country of origin,” Eze said. “I also hope to spend more time in Africa teaching African women the importance of blackness through workshops, seminars or conferences.”
John Agbo, Eze’s friend of three years, said he supported Eze’s participation in the pageant because of the personal qualities that made her stand out.
“Chinecherem is very upright, hardworking and passionate,” Agbo said. “She always goes for what she wants with all of her energy. She is the nicest person I have ever met.”
Eze said she’s learned a lot about herself during the preliminary phase of the pageant, including how to be more self-confident and believe in her abilities.
However, she said that the contest is not only about her personal goals, but also about the impact she can make on the issues she cares about.
“After this competition, I hope that I would spend more time in serving humanity through my humanitarian platforms and to continue to pursue my dreams and purpose in life,” Eze said.

With the 2016 presidential election only days away, students met Wednesday night to discuss the election cycle and its impact on the Jewish community. “Capitol Hill(el),” hosted by USC Hillel and Trojans for Israel, featured a bipartisan panel that included Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Matt Klink, a partner at public affairs firm Ek, Sunkin, Klink & Bai, and Christina Wilkes, the former president of the USC College Democrats.
Kaley Cho | Daily TrojanElection preview · Christina Wilkes, Matt Klink and Dan Schnur discussed the future of American-Israeli relations and other issues pertaining to the Jewish community in regards to the election on Wednesday evening.
The event began with a discussion on how the future president will affect American-Israeli relations.
“At this point, it’s at least worth assuming that [Hillary] Clinton will be elected,” Schnur said, “If we do assume, as most public opinion polls do, that Clinton is going to be successful on Tuesday, I believe that U.S.-Israeli relationships will improve dramatically.”
Schnur said he believes that President Barack Obama’s somewhat terse relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has kept the relationship between the United States and Israel from being as strong as it should be. Wilkes added that Obama’s support for the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel opposes, has contributed to these feelings of mutual discontent.
“The perception is that Obama has been less sympathetic toward Israeli causes,” Wilkes said. “I think that’s done some damage.”
Schnur described the most important challenges he sees between the countries, and said that the next president will need to address these in order to improve American-Israeli relations.
“If you think about the most significant challenges for the U.S. and the Middle East, there are three categories: the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, Iran specifically as it relates to the nuclear arms agreement and ISIS,” Schnur said.
Going forward, Wilkes said she does not foresee many changes regarding the divisive atmosphere that currently exists surrounding American politics.
“The optimist in me wants to see this definitive break between the Clinton years and the Obama years, but I don’t think that’s likely,” Wilkes said. “Cooperation with [Clinton] is probably not going to be something a lot of Republicans want to be seen doing. I don’t see a lot of changes, but hopefully I’m wrong.”
Klink added that bipartisan cooperation would be necessary to repair the relationship with Israel.
“I think one of the foundation mistakes that Barack Obama made was that he excluded the Republicans,” Klink said. “I’m not saying it’s Barack Obama’s fault, but I am saying that leadership has to start at the top.”
The panelists also discussed the California Senate race, between Democrats Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez. All three said they believe Harris will win, but that the fact that they are both from the same party will affect voter turnout.
“The idea is that if you have an area that is very liberal, the more moderate [candidate] will attract Republican votes,” Schnur said. “What’s happened here has been a little bit different. The voters from the other party just don’t vote; one-third or more of registered Republicans in California simply aren’t going to vote in the Senate elections at all.”
Schnur added that he believes Harris will be an important asset to the U.S. Senate.
“One thing I can predict is that [Harris] will become one of the most extraordinary members of the United States Senate,” Schnur said. “Some of that comes from representing a state the size of California, but the other reason is that there are a lot of progressive Democrats, particularly young or minority Democrats, who may vote for Clinton or may just stay home. If President Clinton is going to reach progressive Democrats, it’s going to come from people like Kamala Harris.”
The panel then turned to discuss some general trends in the election, which Schnur acknowledged has been full of surprises.
“To me, what’s most notable in the election is that Trump and Sanders have a great deal in common,” Schnur said. “A lot of voters who felt like they’ve been ignored by the traditional political establishment, who became resentful of the fact that they’ve been ignored, looked for a candidate to express that frustration. Two candidates from polar opposite ends of the spectrum ironically are united by very similar sentiments.”
Klink said that this pointed to the need for widespread political reform in America, especially when it comes to the voting process.
“We need a fundamental change. We need to reform the way we select our candidates — what we have right now is not working,” Klink said.
Wilkes agreed, adding that the rise of candidates like Donald Trump has been fueled by a desperate need for change.
“[Americans] are willing to vote dangerously if that means that’s changing things,” Wilkes said.
“The perception is that Obama has been less sympathetic toward Israeli causes,” Wilkes said. 
The “perception”?
There is no perception about it.  Obama has arguably been THE most hostile president towards Israel.  Let’s not play word games, OK?

An ongoing study from the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy has found that a lack of affordable housing can be a burden for employees and the businesses looking to hire them in Los Angeles.
The study was commissioned by the Los Angeles Business Council and is led by Raphael Bostic, a professor at Price who focuses on urban issues and economic development, and his team of graduate students. The team is surveying 30 businesses spanning the private and public sectors in fields such as health care, education and banking in Los Angeles to determine how a high cost of living affects their ability to hire high-skilled workers.
Preliminary findings of the study, which have already been released, were presented last Friday at the Mayoral Housing, Transportation and Jobs Summit to show the issues ahead of the election, Bostic said. Housing affordability initiatives such as Measure JJJ, which would impose minimum affordable housing requirements and labor regulations on new developments, are on the ballot on Nov. 8.
“We wanted to give people a heads-up that the survey was taking place, and we wanted to give a flavor of some of the things that we have started to find as we talk to employers across the region,” Bostic said. “We wanted to get it out in the context of this election, because there are a number of things going on in the ballot that are relevant to this context.”
Research from organizations such as California Forward shows that L.A. residents face a high cost of living, as 44 percent of households use more than 30 percent of their income on housing. But while this does not strongly impact high-level managers and other higher-paid employees, for whom salaries are adjusted based on housing prices, lower-level, unionized employees are having to leave their jobs and move away to more affordable areas.
“We don’t see the same sorts of packages being offered to people at lower levels,” Bostic said.
The study found that some businesses are “feeling the pinch” of employee losses. Bostic hypothesized that housing prices could be the reason, but as companies aren’t required to ask employees why they leave, it is difficult to determine the exact reason.
On the other hand, some of the respondents in the Price’s survey said that they had no trouble enticing employees to work in expensive areas, according to Bostic. Despite concerns about housing, the L.A. metropolitan area added 93,000 jobs last year, on average with most major metropolitan areas in the United States.
“They don’t find it difficult to find employees, and that there is a very competitive market,” Bostic said. “On some levels, it’s a buyer’s market when it comes to finding employees.”
With this survey, Bostic hopes to get a better sense of the barriers that exist for employees so that businesses can find ways to lessen the burden of increased housing prices. Bostic said that employees are most burdened by long commutes to work to escape areas where housing affordability is an issue. Firms are aware of this issue, and in Bostic’s survey some businesses said 30 to 50 percent of the people they employ are in the car for more than 45 minutes on their way to work. And as home values are expected to increase by 4 percent per year until 2020, according to a report conducted by Beacon Economics, the issue will remain pressing in the near future.
Bostic and his team have interviewed 14 out of the 30 businesses they selected for the survey. He hopes to finish the study by December.
Funding for the project comes from JPMorgan Chase & Co., California Community Foundation, Enterprise   Community   Foundation, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and Habitat   for    Humanity,  according to an LABC press release.

Throughout most of her acting career, Trace Lysette never told anyone she was transgender. Her acting coach encouraged her to keep it a secret, but when she heard about Laverne Cox landing a role in Orange is the New Black, she realized it was possible to be open with her gender identity while still doing what she loved. This led her to take on a role in Transparent, a TV show that tackles the challenges transgender people face when coming out to their family, their friends and society. 
Lysette and several other panelists spoke at USC Wednesday night during “The Trans/Gender Tipping Point?”, a discussion on transgender visibility in today’s entertainment industry hosted by Visions and Voices and the USC LGBT Resource Center. Other panelists included actress Mya Taylor, Museum of Transgender History and Art Executive Director Chris E. Vargas, filmmaker Sam Feder, Transparent director Silas Howard and Transparent co-producers Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst. The event was moderated by USC English and gender studies professor Karen Tongson and gender studies, comparative literature and American studies and ethnicity professor Jack Halberstam.
In the first panel, Taylor discussed her experience starring in Tangerine, a film about transgender street workers set in Hollywood. While working on Tangerine, Taylor and her co-star Kitana Kiki Rodriguez wanted to tell the truth about the life of transgender individuals working the streets as hustlers. She went into the role making her objective clear to the director, Sean S. Baker. Taylor said that because Tangerine is a sad story, she wanted to bring comedy into it because that is truly how she would react to the events that unfolded.
“For me, I don’t like to complain about the less fortunate things that happen to me because there are people that are worse off, so I just make fun of it,” Taylor said. 
The panelists also stressed the importance of friendship in the transgender community. Feder’s new film Kate Bornstein is a Queer and Unpleasant Danger depicts Bornstein’s relationship with her partner Barbara Carellas. The film tells a new story about transgender people that isn’t shown that much in the media: a story of domestic intimacy. 
“I didn’t want to just interview Barbara and be like, ‘Tell me about your relationship,’” Feder said. “I wanted to show their relationship.” 
Similarly, Vargas said that he created the Museum of Transgender History and Art to keep transgender voices alive. Vargas said that many transgender people lived in “stealth,” without others knowing their true identity, and his mission is to create a resource for transgender history. He wanted the future of transgender people to not be forgotten or hidden like it has been in the past. Vargas explained that the increased visibility of transgender people today initiated the creation of the museum and led Vargas to take part in the growing movement. 
Drucker and Ernst, meanwhile, said they set out to create Transparent in order to bring visibility to an issue that they felt wasn’t getting enough attention. 
“I think that we may be the most visible generation of trans people because many of the trans folk that came before us were not as visible and perhaps many of the trans people ahead of us will be less visible,” Ernst said. “It’s a crucial and pivotal time in which things are shifting rapidly.”
Transparent covers issues of class, sexuality and gender, which Ernst and Drucker said creates authenticity. At Wednesday’s event, the two co-producers showed a clip where Lysette’s character discloses her HIV-positive status to her boyfriend. They elaborated on the topic of HIV through a transgender character and used it to develop the character and storyline that connects to people who may be in the same situation.
“I felt really honored to deliver that message because it’s pretty accurate to what a lot of us go through,” Lysette said. “Dating while trans is rough and, of course, having to disclose your status makes it even harder.” 
The panelists stressed that despite the constant struggle in the transgender community, many people are optimistic that the future will be inclusive and bring visibility to the community. However, this doesn’t mean that all of the problems will go away. There are still issues, especially in the entertainment industry, that some panelists stressed. 
“We need more,” Ernst said. “What we need is more shows, more web series, and more short films. I feel like this is the time to make stuff — for students, for younger film makers, for established filmmakers. Whatever your queerest, transest, weirdest, most out there, most unique idea is, this is a great time to make that.”
