When former chairman of the USC Alumni Association in Hong Kong, Garrick Tang, saw photos of a graduation held for a Hong Kong certificate program hosted by the USC US-China Institute, he knew something wasn’t right. The misspelled department names on the certificates held by the smiling graduates piqued his confusion, but what clued him in was the obvious: The program on the certificates did not exist.
Having worked with the Hong Kong Alumni Association for 15 years, Tang, a 1996 alumnus, knows the few programs USC offers in the region “inside and out,” and could tell the program was illegitimate, he said. 
Soon after Tang got wind of the program, the graduation photos reached a Facebook group of more than 2,000 USC alumni living in Hong Kong, many of whom realized none of them had heard of the program claiming to be held by USCI. 
Tang confirmed with the director of USCI, Clayton Dube, that the institute did not run such a program in Hong Kong. 
“We have not authorized anyone to issue certificates in our name or to represent themselves as being authorized to provide any sort of training,” said Dube in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
The USC Hong Kong office reported the incident to Hong Kong police in late October and is currently under investigation, Tang said. USC has since engaged its legal counsel to stamp out all programs claiming affiliation with the University, the USC Office of Strategic and Global Initiatives said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Two programs that advertised authorization to teach USC curricula are currently under investigation. One of these programs, Tang said, is spearheaded by Owen Chow, founder and chairman of the Association of the International Certified Financial Consultant. 
In 2019, Chow claimed to be a lecturer of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism finance program in Hong Kong, which Tang said was incongruent, as the Annenberg school does not host financial studies courses. Moreover, Tang said he would have undoubtedly heard if a scholar from Hong Kong had been appointed as a professor at USC.
“If there’s a Hong Kong guy who got appointed by USC as a professor, we should know. It’s big news for us,” Tang said. “If we got a really good guy who got hired by USC and he’ll be teaching at USC then we should all know. But none of us know this guy.”
Tang said the Chow case was reported to the University two years ago but no action was taken. 
“They knew about it, and they didn’t do anything to stop them,” Tang said. 
The second program, called the “Coaching-Based Leadership program,” held the October graduation and was directed by Ray Poon, the supervisor of education company Modern Continuing Education Centre. Over lunch with Tang, Poon said he paid to run the program and signed a contract with an individual named Larry L. Eastland in 2018. 
A 2018 memorandum from Eastland claimed “Mr. Jonathan So” was USCI’s authorized representative in Hong Kong and stated Eastland’s title as the Chair of the Advisory Committee of the non-existent Institute for Global Leadership. 
Poon, however, said he was misled by an educational agent who told him it had received USCI’s authorization to run the course with Eastland’s help. 
Poon told the South China Morning Post that his leadership course ran for two years, over the course of which 50 students paid $20,000 HKD each, totalling $1 million HKD, or approximately $128,348 USD.
According to Tang, the unauthorized courses presenting themselves as USC-sponsored angered some alumni who felt the programs minimized the value of a USC degree. 
“In a year, [USC students pay] $80,000 to get the degree to spend four years there and [students in the fraudulent certificate courses] pay a few thousand and get the same sort of certificates,” Tang said. “It doesn’t make sense.”
Although Dube said alumni are “agitated” at the illegitimate courses because of how hard they worked to get into USC, he said he does not believe the incident will in any significant way tarnish USC’s reputation in Asia.
“I don’t believe that there will be lasting damage to the University’s reputation,” Dube said. “Yes, if substandard programs are offered in the University’s name for an extended period of time, that can have a corrosive impact on the reputation of the University.”
Dube said the University “works hard to protect its intellectual property” and expects the investigation to be relatively uncomplicated because of the concrete evidence gathered by the Alumni Association and provided by individuals like Poon. 
“In this instance … they had a bit of a paper trail,” Dube said. “They had a company that could be pointed to rather than some sort of vague circumstance, they were able to pursue it.”
Tang also said Chow previously held similar courses that claimed affiliation with Oxford University. The courses have since ended but were not investigated by police, he said.

Faculty and students, chanting “stop the silence, no more violence” gathered on the Bovard Auditorium steps Thursday to voice their concerns about USC administration’s response to the Sigma Nu sexual assault and drugging reports. 
The demonstration was organized by the Undergraduate Student Government, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, faculty liaison Carol Wise and recognized student organizations, including USC Flow, Women in Science and Engineering and professional international relations fraternity Delta Phi Epsilon.
During her opening remarks, Carol Wise, a professor of political science and international relations, said the event aimed to give survivors a chance to openly talk about sexual assault and possible solutions.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, after the event, Wise also said the current University bureaucracy holds many dysfunctional aspects. For Wise, the lack of rape kits on campus indicated this dysfunction.
“[USC administration] could have had the town hall, they could have immediately agreed to the rape kits,” Wise said. “They could have made a couple of concessions right off, they could give us a straight answer as to why it took three weeks to let us know there was a sexual assault.”
Regarding Provost Charles Zukoski’s email that announced the establishment of the Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability, Wise said President Carol Folt was antagonistic to students’ wishes. 
“Folt already knew about this protest, she saw the list of demands, she said ‘I didn’t like it,’” Wise said. “The buck stops with you, right? You don’t like these demands? Well, you know, we don’t like making them, but you’ve got to meet some of them.”
Surrounded by the protests’ organizers holding transcriptions of chants, attendees went up to a podium and spoke on the issue.
 Hilary Schor, professor of English literature and law took to the podium after student appeals for survivor resources and said while the turnout of the event was encouraging, the fact that many felt the need to protest was not.
“I speak to you as someone who has been [at] USC for 36 years. I’ve been working on these issues since my first year as an untenured assistant professor,” Schor said. “Here we are, all these years later, saying things that everyone, including everyone inside this cold-hearted building, knows to be true.”
Schor said the risk of sexual harassment that students face interferes with the University’s function to “nurture” and create a meaningful experience for its student body.
“I cannot do my job if students are not protected,” Schor said. “I stand before you, or more accurately, sit before you, as someone who knows that this struggle is ongoing, that we’re not free until all of us are free.”
Schor then gestured to the Bovard entrance behind her.
“What would it take to make you give a damn? What would it take to make you tell us the truth?” Schor said. “What would it take to make you reminded of your own activities and lack of activities over the years?”
Rachel Holzer and Eva Heinrichs, two principal organizers of the protest and members of DPE and USC Flow, shared their experiences after Schor and implored faculty to “stand up with and for students against the administration.”
“Over the last three and a half years, so many of my friends, myself included, experienced sexual violence on this campus.” Holzer said. “It is really, really incredibly insulting and frustrating.” 
Holzer, a senior majoring in international relations, said she’s frustrated with the timing of the University administration’s response in an interview with the Daily Trojan following the event.
“We’ve created a set of 13 extremely feasible demands that they can implement in the short term,” Holzer said. “I really do not want to see task forces that are going to take a year or two years to do research to see if it’s a big enough issue that it’s worth upsetting the Board of Trustees.”
Holzer also said she doesn’t agree with the working group’s focus on the Interfraternity Council because the issue of sexual assault is campuswide.
“Part of the reason that we wanted to have this at Bovard instead of at Frat Row is because we want to make it very clear that this doesn’t stop and start with Frat Row,” Holzer said. “This is everywhere.”
Heinrichs, a junior majoring in sociology, said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that the Department of Public Safety’s reports fail to tell the full story of sexual assaults on campus.
“It would be so easy to be more transparent, and they’ve done everything they can to stop being transparent about all of these issues just to protect their students and their image,” Heinrichs said. “Administration is not going to step up. They’re going to try to bury it like everything else.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan after the event, DPE President Natalia Parraz, a senior majoring in international relations, said even after a meeting with Folt Wednesday, she was left unsatisfied with the University’s response. Folt posted on Twitter Thursday that the meeting left her “looking forward to working” with Flow and other student organizations toward a “zero-tolerance” campus.
Offering online curriculums on sexual assault are not enough, according to Parraz.
“What we need to be doing is really looking at frat culture and what language they’re using and what behaviors are acceptable,” Parraz said.
Parraz said she thinks the University task force needs an open dialogue with the fraternities about their contribution to rape culture as well as actively involving student voices.
“What I hope happens is that USC decides right now [that] we want a culture that does not tolerate sexual assault,” Parraz said. “There’s a difference between demanding that and then seeing the change that will actually create that.”
Lucy Chi, an alumna and a former patient of George Tyndall, said despite the University’s promises of transparency, USC’s responses have fallen short and failed to include student voices.
“There’s a culture of just turning the other way, ignoring all of the horrible things that happen on this campus. A task force is a decent start, but they really need to do a lot more. I think what they should really do is listen to the students and faculty,” Chi said. “Don’t go to your expensive lawyers and come up with the bare minimum.”

Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, Sample Hall and Wallis Annenberg Hall were evacuated Thursday evening because of a bomb threat. Twenty-eight minutes after the community was notified, the Department of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department announced the reopening of the buildings following searches.
DPS received a phone call at approximately 3:25 p.m. from an “unidentified male caller who claimed he had put explosive devices” in the buildings, said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
DPS sent out an alert ordering evacuations of the three buildings at 4:34 p.m. DPS officers were on scene and conducted their searches before the TrojansAlert was released, Carlisle said.
Carlisle said DPS is required to contact LAPD to handle bomb threats, who directs the investigation from there. 
“[LAPD] made an assessment and were determining whether or not to do an immediate search, evacuate the building and assess the entire situation, so, once those decisions were made, we have to follow the direction of the LAPD, and we consulted with our senior administrators and decided it was best to do an alert to the campus community and evacuate those buildings,” Carlisle said. 
LAPD confirmed in an interview with the Daily Trojan that officers found no evidence of a device or threat. 
A separate alert announced the reopenings at 5:02 p.m. 
The threat came at approximately the same time as similar threats at New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Multiple bomb threats were reported at other colleges and universities over the weekend, including Yale University on Nov. 5 and Brown University, Columbia University and Cornell University on Sunday.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence.
USC will establish a Working Group on Interfraternity Council Culture, Prevention, and Accountability, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Thursday in a communitywide email.
According to the email, the group will have four main tasks: assess the suspension of IFC social activities and the conditions that should be met before they resume; review and possibly redesign IFC’s recognition, education and prevention strategies; re-envision the accountability process; and “tackling the broader issues of sexual assault and misconduct, excessive drinking and drugs.” 
USC suspended IFC social activities on Oct. 22 following reports of druggings and sexual assault at the Sigma Nu Fraternity house. After the initial reports, multiple additional instances of sexual assault and drugging were reported at locations on and off the Row, including at Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity and Chi Phi Eta Delta Fraternity, and other unspecified locations. Community protests led by organizations such as the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence, which includes the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and USC Flow, took place across multiple days at locations including in front of Bovard Auditorium, at the Row and marches from the USC Village to the Row.
Because the recent allegations are said to have occured within fraternity houses, the group will focus primarily on IFC culture and sexual assault prevention. However, its scope will expand to the entire University to combat these issues across the USC community. 
Acting Vice President of Student Affairs Monique Allard and Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer Christopher Manning will serve as the group’s co-chairs. Other group members will include representatives from the Undergraduate Student Government, fraternities and sororities, USC’s offices of Relationship & Sexual Violence Prevention and Equal Opportunity, and Title IX and other faculty. Zukoski said USC will “share the full roster of members soon.”  
Zukoski also urged other community members to share their thoughts and opinions on the subject “in the spirit of mutual respect.”
“We are seeking meaningful outcomes that will include strong preventative efforts with the goal of ending sexual violence on our campus,” Zukoski wrote.
Zukoski promised that the group will “act swiftly,” and expects to deliver their initial recommendations by Dec. 17.

I’m writing this piece in the liminal space of a plane for a flight that was delayed two hours because the previous airplane would simply not work. Flying back home from a chilly New York City where I was visiting my cousin at his university, I realized that, while I worship at the altar of Los Angeles and adore it in spite of all of its messiness and beauty, it was fun to play New Yorker for a bit.
While 99.9% of the fun I had was because of seeing him (I personally think he’s among the best people out there), the other .1% was because of when I visited. I was there at a very particular in-between time (Have you ever heard the lyric “I recall Central Park in fall”? Probably from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” Yeah, that was me singing it on Amsterdam Ave). While I was there, the clocks changed, the Radio City Christmas tree was up, Bryant Park was a winter wonderland, Rockefeller Center opened up ice skating and the Brooklyn bookstore that I visited had a holiday section entirely composed of Hanukkah stories (Books Are Magic, I love you). The realization of the careening of the incoming winter season (and final exams) was startling.
Right now, we are standing at the crossroads of fall and winter, and I think that there is no entertainment news more eagerly anticipated (okay, maybe Adele’s album) than Taylor Swift’s “Red (Taylor’s Version).”
Have you ever heard of a more autumnal record? Have you prepared yourself to have your heart broken by the 10-minute version of “All Too Well”? My questionable decision to primarily build friendships with Swifties has come out in full force. I’m not one myself, so, instead, I rely on pairing books to music. As a pairing for “Red,” you need books to get you through this in-between season. You need to get through the sun setting at 4:30 p.m. as you run to your last class of the day. And the knowledge that this lasts for just about eight months. No sunshine. If you’re a seasonal reader, I’ve got your back.
I read “The Secret History” the summer before my freshman year of university which really seems incongruous to have such a wintry read during the sweltering L.A. heat. Of course, the story gave me a strange idea of what my university years could look like (I could fall into a group that loves Greek mythology to a worrying degree), but it did make me my first friend in college — who is still one of my closest friends — so I suppose it was a worthwhile trade-off.
Written by Donna Tartt, the breakthrough dark academia read follows a group of students’ misadventures at a small New England liberal arts college, which include a murder. Tartt has fantastic character development, a luxurious writing style, quotable moment after quotable moment and a penchant for writing morally gray characters. This isn’t a new book. In fact, it was published in the 1990s, an era that has already wrapped around and had its fashion come back. But, it feels timeless — just like those bodysuits and blue jeans. There really isn’t any need to recommend it any more, you probably already have it on your to-read shelf. It’s on my favorites shelf.
Moving on, you’ve heard of author Taylor Jenkins Reid. In fact, someone in your family or friend group almost certainly was in a book club that read “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” and asked themselves: “Why am I crying over a fictional celebrity?” Just me? OK. Anyway, all you need to know is that former movie star Evelyn Hugo is ready to finally tell all about her seven husbands and her life to “puff piece” writer Monique. Hugo is a woman who knows her strength, who knows her beauty — and she isn’t afraid to say so. In fact, she said it right in the story’s beginning. Reid knows that you want to hear from the celebrity herself, so she settles right into the fictional celebrity’s voice. It’s a luxurious story and it’s perfect for the in-between season.
The first time I read Erin Morgenstern’s “The Night Circus” was by the sea which was incongruous to the rural landscape it was set in, but I was so deeply enveloped in the world that I didn’t care. This is a book that lends itself to being read during any season on a swinging bench of a home that has no neighbors for miles as fireflies buzz around your face.
Morgenstern writes a story in various viewpoints of a circus that only appears at night and the players and the visitors that find themselves in the setting. It has competition and love and Victorian England overtones. It’s one of those special stories where you really shouldn’t know a ton going into it and instead just allow yourself to be swept up in the story.
Maybe it’s just me, but this in-between season reminds me of “High School Musical.” That scene at the very beginning of that first 2006 movie when a baby-faced Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens meet on New Year’s Eve and you already know that they are going to sing “Breaking Free” at the end of the movie (And let’s be honest, you will too).
It’s new beginnings and maybe just like Taylor Swift, we all need some new eras such as “folklore” and all of the “Taylor’s Versions” (So my Swiftie friends tell me). So, as you jam to “22” or re-listening to “Breaking Free” or reading one of these in-between season books instead of writing your final paper, just know that I’m rooting for you.

Men’s basketball will face Temple Saturday in its first away game of the season. After their dominant 40-point victory over Cal State Northridge Tuesday, the Trojans are favored going into the matchup. 
However, Head Coach Andy Enfield said he believes the matchup could be a challenge. 
“Temple is a very tough team, they have a lot of interchangeable players, meaning they can play different positions, and they have a couple guys who can put up big numbers on the scoreboard,” said Enfield in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
The Owls, who had a subpar season last year with a 5-11 record, also had a strong start to their 2021 campaign, defeating the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore 72-49 Wednesday night in their home opener. 
Sophomore guard Khalif Battle led Temple in scoring with 22 points. The New Jersey native added six rebounds. 
“[Battle is] their leading scorer and we have to play good team defense to limit his looks at the basket,” Enfield said. 
While Temple ended its season opener with a comfortable, 23-point victory, it looked sluggish to start the game. 
At halftime, Temple were only up by a point, and the Owls used an explosive 46-point second half to secure their first victory. As a team, Temple struggled from the foul line, making only 56.3% of its free throws.  
The Trojans on the contrary did not start slow in their season opener. USC led CSUN 52-19 at halftime, thanks to the strong performances of junior guard Boogie Ellis and junior forward Isaiah Mobley. 
There was plenty of scoring for USC, as 12 Trojans got on the board and three starters scored in the double-digits. USC also beat CSUN in all statisticalcategories. 
All 13 scholarship players saw playing time. 
“We have a super long amount of weapons on our team,” Mobley said. “We’re really deep, so getting everyone involved will make us hard to beat.” 
Mobley also expressed his excitement for the season’s first away game. 
“I’m excited. Temple’s a good opponent, should be a good atmosphere,” he said. 
Mobley was the first Trojan to score a basket this season with a three-point shot from the top of the arc. He went on to score 15 points and add 9 rebounds. Senior guard Drew Peterson also had 14 points. 
The matchup between Ellis and Battle is one to pay attention to, with the two offensive-minded guards scoring double digit points in the opener. 
Battle averaged 15 points and 6.4 rebounds per game last season as a sophomore after transferring from Butler.  
Ellis, who was named the AAC Co-Sixth Man of the Year last season, looks forward to heading to Philadelphia. Ellis began his college career at Memphis before transferring to USC. 
“I’m super excited to get on the court again and see what it’s like against adversity with these guys,” Ellis said. “I’m pretty sure we will do well if we do the little things and communicate.” 
The game will tip off at 4 p.m. Saturday and will be streamed on ESPN+.

Visions and Voices and the School of Cinematic Arts hosted critically-acclaimed filmmaker Thomas Allen Harris for “Family Pictures USC: How I Got Here” Wednesday. The webinar was the first of a two-part series working with Harris and his project which connects film, photography, history and identity through family photos. Harris, who has traveled across the United States speaking to people about their heritage and community through collected photographs, brought his techniques to the USC community. 
“Our methodology helps people become more understanding, empathetic and patient with our differences,” Harris said. 
After an introduction to Harris’ PBS series “Family Pictures USA,” Harris spoke to nine panelists about their journeys to becoming USC faculty. Panelists included deans and professors from the School of Cinematic Arts, Dornsife College of Letters, Art and Sciences, the Office of Religious Life and the Middle East Media Initiative.
Although Visions and Voices and SCA held the event virtually, Harris and members brought palpable energy to the space. The event allowed panelists to share images that represented the path they took to get to USC and detail the meaning of those images and their different identities. 
SCA Vice Dean of Academic Affairs, Michael Renov, has known Harris for more than two decades. Renov, who helped in the preliminary stages of planning this event, said “Family Pictures USC” intends to engage students by discovering unknown connections with others in the USC community. 
Harris, who is also a senior lecturer of African American and film and media studies at Yale University, discussed ways audiences could learn about their family’s history and culture through photographs. The event showcased Harris and his ability to listen and guide participants when discussing their stories and connection to USC, a skill that made his work impactful and serves as a powerful tool in his filmmaking.  
“This is just a way to really dig deeper and to see what we mean when we talk about identity formations,” Renov said. “[This] is a way to build bridges across cultural differences so that people realize that their own stories and their own identity formation is really very much like that of others.” 
Organizers collaborated with Harris’ producers and spent time searching for USC community  members who would be willing to share their family photos with Harris and the audience. Director of Programming and Special Projects at SCA Alex Ago said Wednesday’s event served as a jump off point for students to investigate their own journeys. The second part of this event, which will take place in January 2022, will parallel Wednesday’s event but will ask students instead of faculty to collect images from their journeys. 
“I thought that it would probably work best if we provided the students with an introductory session,” Ago said. “Then we use that as a launchpad to put out a call for submissions to invite our students from across the University to participate in.”
During the event, Harris and a collection of USC faculty discussed ways their upbringings shaped their path to USC. Professor of music Ronald McCurdy discussed his journey with the music industry and his relationship with his parents — the driving influence that led him to become an educator. McCurdy said this event was important because it allowed students to make connections with the USC faculty. 
“Sometimes students don’t necessarily know the path that faculty members have taken to get where they are,” McCurdy said. “I would imagine that being as diverse as USC is, all stories [are] very different.” 
Panelist and lecturer for the Dornsife writing program, Maddox Pennington, also described their influences and background as an Indigenous person that led them to educate others. Pennington said one of the reasons why this event was so interesting was because students and faculty could discover insights about other members of the USC community.
“We’re hoping that the students will look at the experiences of the faculty and staff and administrators who are on this and realize that they can also do this work of choosing photos and looking for how your story emerges when you study them,” Pennington said.
The exercise allowed the panelists to reflect on who and what made their journeys particularly important. Before the event, McCurdy said he looked forward to displaying photographs that represent the influences that led him to USC and believes the importance of this event boils down to the people that guided you to the spaces you are in now.
“[My photos are] about mentors and people who had a tremendous impact on your life during your formative years,” McCurdy said. “So I’m excited to have a chance to share about people who were in my life, who made it possible for me to be where I am today as a professor.” 
Renov said he is excited to have students go through the exact same procedure because it will give them the same opportunity to reflect. 
“This is all about the very process of investigating people’s family histories in their memories through their family photographs,” Renov said. “We would all be better off if we took a look back and thought and reflected a little bit about how we came to be the people that we are.”

Women’s volleyball is currently on a five-game losing streak and has only won five of its last 20 sets. USC’s latest losses came last weekend against Colorado and No. 16 Utah. 
Now, USC travels to Eugene and Corvallis to take on No. 17 Oregon and Oregon State this weekend. 
Although the team is currently struggling, Head Coach Brad Keller recently finished up a strong 2022 recruiting class. On Wednesday, which was National Signing Day, USC completed an elite recruiting cycle, and inked commitments from three top prospects in the country. The big commitments came from outside hitter Jordan Middleton — the No. 2 ranked recruit in the 2022 class —, right-side hitter Adonia Faumuina and libero Gala Trubint. 
“Jordan has grown immensely from the time we began recruiting her and has shown the ability to dominate a match from anywhere on the court,” said Keller in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “She brings athleticism, intensity and a winning mentality that is infectious. Jordan also exemplifies the values we put on family. We anticipate and expect Jordan will have an immediate impact for us.” 
Faumuina and Trubint are ranked No. 7 and No. 90, adding some depth to the class. 
“I feel absolutely fantastic about it,” Keller said. “We signed the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. Great kids, great people, the whole thing. Looking forward to that group coming in and having an impact for us.”
With matchups against a pair of Oregon schools coming up this week, Keller said that minor tweaks have been made, but overall things are the same as always.
“We actually practiced a little bit more this week, we’re a little bit more fresh this week,” he said. “We worked on a little more specific things that pertain to Oregon and Oregon State, but, other than that, it’s same as usual for us for preparation purposes.”
USC played both the Ducks and Beavers once this season. The Trojans’ last win came on Oct. 22 when they beat Oregon State 3 sets to 1 at Galen Center. 
Two days later, however, USC lost a tight one to Oregon at Galen Center after it took the Ducks to five sets, but ultimately fell short 16-14 in the fifth set to seal the loss. Oregon was ranked No. 16 at the time.
Oregon State comes off a loss against Stanford but faces UCLA Friday before USC. Oregon, on the other hand, has won four of its last five matches. 
USC won’t have home court advantage this weekend, but that hasn’t been an issue in the past against Oregon teams. Since 2015, USC has a 10-1 record in the state. This season, however, the Trojans are 5-6 in away matches.
With a current record of 10-13, Keller recognizes how the significance of these two upcoming games. 
“We gotta go 5-1 in order to be eligible for the NCAA tournament, and the goal will always be to make A) the NCAA tournament and B) to make deep runs to compete for national championships, and no matter what the record is, that’s always gonna be the case,” he said. “We’re always gonna be working towards that goal.” 
The next steps to achieving those goals will come this weekend in Eugene and Corvallis. 
“We’ll take it one point at a time, one game at a time, and we’re just gonna try to do our best against Oregon coming here first,” Keller said. 
USC will face Oregon Friday at 4 p.m. and Oregon State Sunday at noon.

Hello Friday readers, welcome to my column! I got an extension on this week’s article to more comprehensively assess the success of this year’s global climate conference — some may call it procrastination — they aren’t wrong — but I call it good journalism! At the time of this article’s publication, the 26th annual United Nations Conference of the Parties, held in Glasgow, Scotland, will have just closed.
The UN has hosted these annual global climate change summits for more than two decades. Negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens from countries around the world meet in a designated host city for two weeks to focus on implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Arguably, climate conferences are the ultimate high-stakes group project. But, if all the group members don’t get their act together, the damage will be a lot more irreparable than a bad grade. Instead of missed deadlines, rescheduled meetings and some light ghosting, the consequences include increased global temperatures, a more rapidly changing climate, increased wealth disparities, rampant food insecurity and more intense weather patterns, just to name a few. 
Because of the pandemic, COP26 was the first international climate conference held since 2019, so the pressure was on. Regarded as the world’s “last best hope” for avoiding the worst of climate change, the conference invited delegates from 195 countries to Scotland with the hopes of creating methodologies to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement goal: limit the global average temperature increase over the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. 
The United Kingdom claimed the event was destined to be “the most inclusive COP ever,” yet the reality was far from the truth. Perhaps the best way to sum up the achievements over those two weeks was a recent Tweet from climate activist Greta Thunberg: “#COP26 has been named the [most] excluding COP ever. This is no longer a climate conference. This is a Global North greenwash festival. A two week celebration of business as usual…” 
Thunberg is not alone in accusing Glasgow of being exclusionary. Thanks to capitalist priorities and pandemic limitations, conference regulations were more stringent than ever. Between travel restrictions and extraordinarily high lodging costs, developing nations and nonprofits found it unusually difficult and expensive to attend the conference. Prices were hiked even higher because of labor and supply shortages caused by the pandemic and Brexit. 
Developing countries’ lack of participation created an even greater power imbalance and failed to account for their interests in negotiations. Even as major world leaders from high emitters such as Russia and China failed to attend, the absence of Global South representation resulted in a disproportionate and ineffective power dynamic.
Additionally, pandemic protocols effectively gatekept one of the conference’s most important aspects — civic engagement. While the civil society’s participation is a keystone aspect of climate conferences, social distancing and limited seating at open forums only heightened feelings of exclusion. Aspiring attendees were regularly stuck in hours-long lines, bogged down by travel red lists and encountered wheelchair-accessibility issues. While protests and demonstrations continued in the city’s streets, activists felt that their social movements were disconnected from the conference itself.
In general, capitalism fuels disparities at climate conferences, and COP26 was no exception. The conference’s location, the accessibility of translators at forums, the conference’s general content and most organizational decisions benefit developed countries in the Global North over the developing nations of the Global South. 
Because of difficulties in obtaining vaccines and visas and receiving a literal seat at the table for negotiations, the voices of those at the forefront of climate change’s impact failed to be heard. And, hybrid events were of little to no benefit to countries and territories with minimal internet access. 
COP26 was a predictable disappointment that shows us just how counterintuitive global climate conferences are in attempting to produce tangible international progress. The bread and circuses of global climate conferences yield little substance; instead, they are an energy- and resource-intensive, commercialized photo opportunity for world leaders while activists and nonprofits congregate outside pleading for progress. 
While many climate change demonstrations have showed the collective power of social movements, they also served as frustrating reminders that progress is limited without the legitimate cooperation of government leaders.
Despite our yearly optimism, Glasgow reminded us that transparency, accessibility and political progress fall to the backburner at climate conferences — global leaders preach aggressive climate action and make bold declarations, only to follow them up with watered-down resolutions and apathetic, nonbinding legislation. The gap between promise and policy continues to grow, as does the divide and distrust between the Global North and South. 
I’m no stranger to a lackluster group project — I’ve had my fair share of late nights picking up the slack for group mates and scrambling to assemble a presentation before the deadline. However, that’s not an option when it comes to the climate crisis. Stopping or even slowing climate change’s effects requires legitimate commitment from every nation. 
A group is only as strong as its weakest link, and if that link emits record-high amounts of greenhouse gases, the success of our efforts will be incredibly limited. 
Regarding the UN, coordinating representatives from around the world with different priorities, languages and cultures is incredibly difficult. Although the United States and China made progress by announcing their cooperation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they have not clarified the agreement’s specifics yet. Despite the limited international progress that came out of the conference, the real outcomes have already become clear. 
The sparse guest list, ableism, lack of equitable arrangements for developing nations and closed doors to civil society at COP26 showed a lack of regard for adequate representation and set our course further away from the international cooperation we desperately need for effective climate intervention.

Everyone knows USC is expensive. For the 2021-22 school year, tuition is $60,446, and that number does not even include housing or dining. Students who struggle to pay tuition often look for cheaper ways to fulfill their graduation requirements, such as graduating early or transferring units from community colleges. However, by placing strict requirements on the academic system, USC makes it extremely hard for students to save money.
For example, USC caps units earned before high school graduation at 32. This cap means that students who took many AP exams or college classes in high school do not get to transfer all of their units to USC, making them stay longer at USC and spend more on tuition. Schools such as the University of California, Los Angeles do not have a similar rule, allowing students to transfer as many units as they want. 
After enrolling, USC also makes it extremely difficult for students to transfer in course credits. It does not allow students to fulfill their General Education Core Literacy Requirements at outside institutions, which forces students to take them at USC. Additionally, USC only accepts courses taken during the summer semester for transfer credit, meaning students cannot take transfer courses during the fall or spring. 
This rule makes it difficult for students to take transfer courses, as they may need a prerequisite course or be busy with internships and jobs during the summer. All these restrictions have one effect: They force students to fulfill their requirements at USC and pay high tuition. In contrast, UC Berkeley allows students to take transfer courses any time of the year and transfer in general education requirements. 
USC places even more restrictions on transfer units as students stay longer at USC. For example, once a student completes 64 units, USC only allows them to transfer in eight units. Therefore, juniors must complete basically the rest of their coursework at USC. The University provides no reasoning for this decision. Instead, it simply forces students to follow this rule. 
Students also cannot take more units per semester at USC to graduate early. Each unit above 18 costs an additional $2,035, making it unrealistic for students to pile on classes. Not all colleges have this rule; other private schools, such as Cornell, allow students to take additional units for free, as long as they can show they can mentally handle the extra coursework. Although USC offers exceptional funding and the Academic Achievement Award for students wanting to take more than 18 units, these scholarships do not necessarily cover the complete cost and do not apply to all students. 
These regulations make it extremely hard for students to graduate early, forcing them to stay at the University and pay USC tuition. They are unique to USC, as many other colleges make it much easier for students to save money on tuition. The University’s subtle money-making ways in the academic system hurt students, who may have to graduate later than they want and take out more loans. 
Some of the regulations seem contradictory. For example, students are only allowed to fulfill General Education requirements at outside institutions before enrolling at USC, and once they enroll, they must take GE classes at USC. This rule does not make any sense; enrolling at USC shouldn’t make it suddenly necessary to take all classes at USC. Instead, these regulations just make it harder for students to transfer coursework.
Not to mention the fact that incoming students rarely know about these hidden rules and enroll before understanding USC’s class system. After enrolling, they are forced to follow the University’s strict guidelines, spending more money than they might want to. These regulations, thus, do not only drain students’ wallets but also deceive them and speak to the University’s lack of transparency.
USC needs to relax these regulations regarding transfer work, especially if there is no solid reasoning for the specific rule. This flexibility would allow students more academic freedom in their classes and less financial stress while finishing their degree.
