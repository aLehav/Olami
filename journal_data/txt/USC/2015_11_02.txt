It’s 7:30 a.m. and it’s a struggle to even open your eyes. Class starts at 8 a.m. and you wonder how you will get from your soft, warm bed to your cold, hard classroom. What will motivate you this time?
Music, of course — not caffeine. It has the capacity to create change, inspire creativity and invoke positivity. All things that you need to start your morning off right. These seven songs are sure to get you to class on time and feeling good!
When we talk about lightening the mood, this is the song that comes to mind — upbeat, groovy and, of course, happy. Williams’ smooth voice and heavy bass will inspire you to dance your way to class. It’s a simple song, but it does the trick.
This is controlled dissonance at its best. Alt-J combines horns, guitar, human percussion and voices to create something unique. Left Hand Free doesn’t follow the typical arrangement that we find in pop today. The sudden change in power with the addition of drums and horns will do enough to jolt you from your dream-like state.
This sweet tune will inspire you to try to match Adam Levine’s falsetto and fail miserably. The differing aspects of the song work together perfectly, and will make your ears smile. With its catchy bassline and nicely-arranged melody, you’ll wake up in no time.
You can’t forget about good ol’ Michael. Since almost everyone who is into music knows this song by heart, you will fall into your routine immediately. Try to move to the beat. Going with what you know or love is the best idea when waking up, because it will grab your attention long enough so you do not fall back asleep.
Each verse in “Uprising” works up to a climax which ends with a bang — a guitar riff and “c’mon.” So if you are tired beyond belief and need to be woken up multiple times, this song is right for you. You can almost treat it like a metaphor for rising above sleep’s inordinate amount of power. The chorus repeats multiple times and each time the power picks up. By the end of the song you will be ready to take on the day.
If you want a song that starts and ends strong, then look no further. Prepare to get slapped in the face if you set this as your alarm clock. Though it starts before you even know it, this song has a very engaging melody that will keep you up.
The opening piano is light and peppy, a tune that’s sure to guide you to the world of the living. Additionally, the bridge really helps the song end on a strong note. In the bridge, the music pauses, and we just get voice and rhythmic elements. It leads back to the chorus, which will certainly brighten up your morning.

Blogger Charlotte Wulff found it strange she was not allowed to use her computer during lecture. Charlotte Wulff | Daily Trojan
After two months of attending business classes at USC, I have concluded that the curricula and teaching style here is vastly different from those at my business school in the Netherlands. I like some aspects of my classes, but some other things really get under my skin.
A noticeable difference in teaching style here compared to back home is that many business classes have multiple small assignments rather than one large one. My American friends tell me that these many small deadlines keep them disciplined and focused on the class. At many western European universities, lectures are not mandatory and the grades for many classes will depend on one large exam, assignment or presentation at the end of the semester. This approach is supposed to teach students the self-discipline they will need when starting a career. I am a big proponent of this system because I believe that one of the most important things to learn at university is how to be intrinsically motivated. It teaches you to be responsible without external pressure from professors who ask you to, “Please hand in your homework and do all the readings please because there might be a pop quiz.”
To me, due to certain rules in my classes, studying at USC sometimes feels like an extension of high school. One of my classes in Marshall has a very strict “no electronic devices” policy to ensure that students will not be distracted. This annoys me because I like to take notes on my laptop, and we live in a day and age where this is increasingly the norm. I also believe that it should be my own responsibility to pay attention during class. If I can still pass my exams even if I occasionally check Facebook, and I am not distracting anybody else by doing so, then why does it concern my lecturer? I do not believe that treating young adults like children is constructive to their development.
Another thing I am critical of is giving credit for participation. I am hesitant to assume that participation is necessarily a reflection of intelligence or understanding, rather than one of effort. Though putting effort into a subject is great and necessary, I do not think that as much importance should be placed on whether a student contributes much in class versus how well they demonstrate their knowledge on an exam or in an assignment. In-class discussions can be constructive, but in one of my classes (in which 25 percent of the grade is based on participation) people seem to be talking for the sake of talking and not adding very much to the conversation. From my European perspective, a system heavily based on participation could backfire, and allow students who are not necessarily intelligent or skillful to still receive high grades and diminish the value of the degree.
Now I want to give some serious credit to the things about studying at USC that I do like compared to studying in Rotterdam. So far, all of my lecturers have been extremely clear about what class material will be tested on the exam. They explain what is most important through the use of study guides. Back home, lecturers sometimes just prescribe an entire textbook that was not even fully covered in class, and then ask questions about material that I swear I have never seen. Professors are never vague about testable material in my USC classes, and it saves me a lot of stress and confusion.
Another thing I love about classes at Marshall (and music industry classes at Thornton) is that there is a clear emphasis on thoughtful writing, presenting and teamwork — skills that are necessary in order to build a successful business career. The Rotterdam School of Management is also very strong in this area, but that’s certainly not reflective of other Dutch business schools.
The classes I am taking all focus on their practical applications in specific industries rather than on academic research. I find practical advice from guest speakers and lecturers who are extremely knowledgeable about their own industry to be the main asset of my USC classes. Classes at my home university tend to sometimes require students to remember specific theoretical frameworks and research that is not always useful in the real world. Finally, I really appreciate the individual attention that I am receiving from my lecturers.
My ultimate viewpoint is this: while teamwork and presentation skills are important to succeed in life, intrinsic motivation and time-management are equally valuable. Not every boss will give you detailed instructions and frequent small deadlines. It pays off to be the kind of person with the initiative and organizational skills to independently build large projects in the long term. This is what the Erasmus University of Rotterdam taught me. So even though my classes at USC are extremely interesting and useful, I cannot help but feel that this educational system is designed to help many people to earn a business degree, regardless of intellect or initiative. If it does not necessarily take intelligence or intrinsic motivation to achieve a bachelor’s title, it makes me wonder about the actual educational value of a degree earned in the United States.

Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The first and last weekender of my college career can be considered a success! Despite the numbing drive up and down California, it will undoubtedly be one of the most memorable experiences of my college career. It sure helps that we came away with a gritty win against a tough opponent on the road. We caught Cal when they were in a slump and we were on a roll. Cal was nice enough to give me a ticket about as far away from the field as possible and right behind the end zone. But hey, it was part of the experience and I loved every minute of it. There were numerous injuries, notably to JuJu Smith-Schuster, Su’a Cravens, and Cam Smith, that could have disheartened the Trojans. But the team is showing a newfound resiliency behind Coach Clay Helton. He is doing his best to make a case for him being the next coach, but it is still too soon to tell. The upcoming games against Arizona and Colorado are winnable games for the Trojans. Let’s just hope they don’t provide the unnecessary suspense that Cal provided. I think we are developing as a team and playing the kind of tough football that USC used to be known for back in the glory days.
Grades:
Quarterback: B+
Running Backs: B+

Prediction: USC 35 – Arizona 38
 
Fight On!
Nothing is too short to tell.  Clay Helton is far superior to Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian as a coach.  The previous head coaches of USC appeared to be lackign in technique and training ability.

USC service workers ratified a new labor contract with their employer, Aramark, on Saturday after months of contract negotiations that concluded Wednesday night. Workers assembled at the Service Workers International Union headquarters to accept the new contract in a unanimous vote.
On Wednesday, a bargaining committee composed of five workers and several SEIU representatives came to an agreement on the terms of the labor contract, which will replace the old contract that expired on June 30. In order to design a new contract, service workers protested Aramark’s attempts to downsize their health care benefits and demanded wage increases and improved working conditions.
Under the new contract, which became effective immediately, workers will receive a $0.50 wage increase across the board, with successive increases raising the total pay boost to $1.65 by July 2017. The contract expires on Dec. 31, 2017, after which time a new contract will again have to be negotiated.
According to Edmundo Garcia, an SEIU representative present at the negotiations, the main wage issue the janitors struggled with was the significant discrepancy between the wages of more and less experienced workers. Though many workers earned around $14.85 per hour — well above the current Los Angeles minimum wage of $9 — there were at least 25 workers earning under $10, which many consider to be below a living wage in Los Angeles.
The contract also addressed other areas of importance to workers, such as allowing increased access to the mediation process and protecting health care benefits, which, according to Garcia, was the workers’ number one priority. Furthermore, negotiators managed to reduce workers’ health care premiums from 8 percent to 7 percent, an important victory that Garcia said workers were “very happy” with.
“This is a really great contract that we were able to put together — it’s a testament to the workers, the bargaining committee and the activism of our janitors at USC,” Garcia said. “We definitely did a lot of actions on campus, and we’re supported by several student organizations, who even [sent] a delegation to Aramark at one point.”

Last week, Department of Public Safety officers began carrying red and gold trading cards emblazoned with pictures of USC football players. The cards are intended to serve as an icebreaker for officers to interact with children in the community as part of a department-wide effort to expand community involvement.
This push is led by Elizabeth Carreno, head of community relations for DPS. She pitched the idea to DPS Chief John Thomas several months ago, modeling it after the way Los Angeles Police Department officers used to carry baseball cards for kids to collect. She collaborated with the Athletics Department to select players and collect statistics and pictures to create cards for 12 football players.
For the past year, officers have carried sticker “badges” to give to kids. That initiative saw great success — after going through an initial order of 2,000 badges, Carreno had to order another batch of 5,000, then two more batches of 10,000 badges apiece. She decided that the trading cards would be another way for officers to interact with the younger demographic.
“There’s a saying that people won’t remember what you do for them — they’ll remember what you do for their children,” Carreno said. “I think that’s definitely true, in any community that you’re working in, so we want to make that positive connection.”
Carreno was attentive to the details in making the trading cards. Along with typical statistics such as position, height and weight, the back of each card includes the major of the athlete to remind the children that USC athletes are students as well. She hopes that children in the community will be encouraged to dream of futures in which they are USC students. Each card also includes a quote from a DPS officer offering inspiration about staying safe and making smart decisions.
“It humanizes the officers in a way that is difficult to do,” Carreno said. “The uniform can be intimidating, especially for the younger kids, but that’s not what the officers are there to do. We want to break down that intimidation and make the community comfortable with our officers.”
Thomas addressed the fact that tensions between police officers and communities across the country have risen in recent years. This was the main impetus behind his decision to create Carreno’s department. He applauds her for constantly brainstorming new ideas to increase both DPS and USC involvement with the community.
“There’s a pressure to make sure that our community can trust us,” Thomas said. “We’re going to rise to that. We’re going to make sure they know we’re on their side.”
In the future, Carreno hopes to include trading cards for basketball, baseball and soccer players. She is also working on other projects to expand officer involvement. These include assigning officers to foot beats, hosting “Coffee With A Cop” events and installing Little Free Libraries in local neighborhoods.
“We can’t arrest our way to a safer community,” Thomas said. “If we want a safe community, we have to work to create it, and that takes constant involvement to make people feel safe.”

Due to financial problems, the Fresh & Easy grocery store, located on Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard, is scheduled to close in late November. The South L.A. store, which has been in business for over five years, is one of several hundred Fresh & Easy stores to close across the West Coast due to the company’s recent bankruptcy.
Many students who rely on the store because of its selection, proximity to campus and long hours were upset to hear it would be closing. “Fresh & Easy had a very specific niche that it focused on — their ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook meals were ideal for a busy student’s life,” said Sagar Miglani, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration. “It was a favorite amongst USC students.”
Miglani, like many other students, lives in University Gateway Apartments, which is located in the same building as Fresh & Easy.
“Fresh & Easy was the store I would stop by regularly at on my way to class, either for water or for a meal,” he said.
Part of Fresh & Easy’s appeal, other than its easily accessible groceries, was that it was open 24 hours a day.
“[Now], my access to late-night groceries are limited, at least temporarily,” said Nimarta Singh, a junior majoring in international relations and the global economy.
Singh, like Miglani, also lives in Gateway, and will be affected highly by this change.
“Fresh & Easy was one of the main reasons I chose to live in Gateway,” she said. “I know many USC students are unhappy and a little disconcerted.”
Students who live on campus, such as Zora Kidron, a freshman majoring in art history, are also disappointed by the closing of the store.
“Fresh & Easy is one of the few 24-hour establishments near campus, and its closure will represent a significant inconvenience for me,” Kidron said.
Fresh & Easy’s bankruptcy also adversely affects employees, said Fresh & Easy employee Shannyn Eddings.
“For most [employees], this is their main job or their only job,” Eddings said. “So now, they have to start over because there are no jobs.”
Eddings added that because of the company’s financial situation, employees are not receiving severance pay.
“We’re [just] getting our last checks and our [paid/personal time off]. If you haven’t saved up your PTO, that’s nothing,” she said.

Supporters of USC Forward, an organization that aims to change the University’s spending policies, gathered outside Bovard Auditorium on Friday to protest rising tuition costs, low faculty wages, high executive salaries and the University’s impact on the surrounding community. The demonstration included students, faculty and representatives from community organizations such as the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, faculty of USC Forward, the Clean Carwash Campaign, the Communications Workers of America, the Service Employees International Union and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
More than 50 demonstrators circled Bovard, chanting slogans such as “put people over profit,” before gathering outside the office of President C. L. Max Nikias to deliver a letter explaining the organization’s demands. A spokesperson from the president’s office assured protestors that Nikias would receive the letter.
According to its website, USC Forward is “a coalition of students, faculty, alumni and community fighting for a better USC.” The organization’s goals are to increase transparency and to direct funding back towards students, faculty and the local community and away from executive compensation.
Maria Rodriguez, a member of SCALE and a student organizer of the demonstration, explained that one of the core issues USC Forward is trying to address is the amount of money that the University spends on management and administrative costs.
“We are asking the administration to really consider where the tuition dollars that we are spending [are] going,” Rodriguez said, citing this year’s nearly $2,000 tuition hike. “We’re holding them accountable, and we need them to know that students here, faculty members, community members, religious leaders, want to know where that money is going, because it’s not going into the hands of the faculty members that teach here.”
Event organizers set up Halloween-themed booths and handed out bright flyers to passersby; signs listed the difference between executive and faculty salaries, ending with the question, “WTF are we paying for?” According to USC Forward, administrative staffing has increased 306 percent since 1987, and the president receives an annual salary of $1,942,935.
Faculty members involved in the demonstration focused on the low salaries and lack of job security that they face while working at USC. According to Andrea Parra, an associate professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese, non-tenure-track faculty have to take on increasing amounts of administrative tasks, which leaves them working greater hours without significant pay increases. Parra, who has worked at USC since 1999, believes that these working conditions could ultimately impact USC students if these issues are not addressed.
“Living in Los Angeles is quite expensive, and trying to make ends meet on USC’s starting salary is quite difficult,” Parra said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “At one time, faculty often taught at other colleges to supplement their incomes, but then the University prohibited teaching elsewhere altogether, leaving contingent faculty between a rock and a hard place.”
Members of ACCE, meanwhile, addressed the impact that University activities, such as the building of the University Village, have on the surrounding community. Martha Sanchez, a member of ACCE who spoke at the demonstration, said the construction and other USC land purchases have forced out community residents, while the University’s lack of hiring in the area has left the neighborhood with a dearth of jobs.
“For the last 16 years I have witnessed how this institution has been eating away at community businesses, affordable housing, and many other retail stores that used to serve people living in this community,” Sanchez said. “USC has built walls and placed guards on every street corner. We are outsiders to this campus.”
Nikias did not respond to requests for comment.
What a sad protest and situation. This well-meaning protest seems to be all about adjunct faculty seeking higher pay, with the community piece thrown in for good measure. But the reality is that USC staff — here apparently lumped together with ALL non-faculty and therefore considered to be part of the problem (too much pay, etc.) — have IN FACT little or no rights due to the REQUIRED use of ARBITRATION that avoids legal issues, in the event of wrongdoing or malice on the part of USC and its people. 
Having endured extreme discrimination by USC female supervisors, and having demonstrated to USC that the Human Resources department was complicit in wrongfully treating me, I had no choice other than to leave USC or to seek ARBITRATION — despite USC’s own admission of wrongdoing and failure to process according to its own rules. If you look at ARBITRATION, you will see that very, very few EVER win and most are left financially and psychically bankrupt. Thus, USC need never deal with the reality of its sad campus dynamics.
If this group really wishes to change things at USC, it must recognize the deplorable conditions under which most staff work. Often supervisors are negligent, emotionally inappropriate, and incapable of fulfilling their responsibilities. In such cases, USC provides such persons with exhaustive Human Resources support, and allows for ANY ill treatment of the staff victim — as long as the inappropriate treatment does not violate federal discrimination laws. It is really quite remarkable that the leadership and USC Board of Trustees allow this to continue. President Nikias should be removed at this point, if he continues to refuse to address this very real and sad issue.
Fight On — or whatever.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Middle East Studies program and the Gould School of Law International Human Rights Clinic hosted Amr Hamzawy to give a lecture on human rights in Egypt and rising above the fear of the current autocracy Monday afternoon in Leavey Library.
Hamzawy has a long history in the realm of political science. He is currently researching Egyptian domestic policies in a historical context at Stanford University following a recent lift on his travel ban. He also teaches political science at the Cairo University and the American University of Cairo and was elected to the first parliament following the January 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Hamzawy has also served as a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
During his talk, Hamzawy reflected on the human rights situation in Egypt. In order to help the audience get a sense of the current state of the region, Hamzawy gave a recent history of key political developments in Egypt.
“The timeline is basically the last two years, from July 2013,” Hamzawy said. “A military coup took place in which an elected president was removed and semi-democratic dynamics were announced terminated. What followed, from a human rights perspective, [was] a period of human rights violations and abuse unprecedented in modern Egyptian history.”
Tumult in Egypt began with Arab Spring protests in January 2011 that started the transition of power.
Mass protests deposed Hosni Mubarak, but not before he killed 846 people, according to BBC News. Mohammed Morsi of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice party was then elected in June 2012. Only one year after his election, the military took over and drafted a new constitution, creating an autocratic regime that exists to this day.
Hamzawy described four issues that people should be aware of — the current military establishment, which is centered around the defense minister; the constitutional amendments in place; the lack of a framework for transitional justice, which means people can be imprisoned without going to a court of law; and the absence of accountability.
“The third legal-slash-constitutional issue, which is of relevance here, is once again not in the sense of introducing an anti-freedom, anti-right, anti-liberty set of constitutional, legal changes, but in the sense of not introducing needed constitutional and legal amendments in a country where an attempt was made between 2011 and 2013 to democratize,” Hamzawy said. “We lack a framework of transitional justice.”
Hamzawy then went into factual detail regarding the aggregate human rights abuses by Mubarak, Morsi and the military autocracy.
Hamzawy said 30,000 to 40,000 Egyptians were detained without due legal process, 1,500 Egyptians were killed in the past couple of years and there are many reports that point to excessive torture and sexual abuse in prisons, yet many officials receive impunity.
“We have a trend [of] extra-judicial killings happening repeatedly in Egypt throughout the last couple of months,” Hamzawy said. “On average you have around 10 Egyptians killed in Sinai, and their identities are not disclosed.”
Hamzawy said there are many Egyptians groups who have conflicting beliefs as to what the future of Egypt should look like.
“It is highly polarized, and there are two narratives clashing without mediation,” Hamzawy said.
When the floor was opened to questions, there were some dissenting voices, including an especially harsh one from Suzan Wali, a lecturer for the Middle East studies program.
“I am Egyptian, and all my friends and family are Egyptian, and listening to you, I think you are talking about a different country. Egyptians are very happy with the situation now,” Wali said. “I expected you to praise the Egyptian army acting at the will of the people, who took the streets by millions asking the army to ask Morsi to step down.”
Hamzawy proposed a counterargument to this point.
“If citizens are so happy why didn’t they go out and vote in the parliamentary election?” Hamzawy said. “Why was the voter turnout, even according to the government, 20 percent?”
Egyptian students sought advice on how to make a difference in their country, and Hamzawy explained that the most powerful tool that they have is their connection to Egypt.
“Do not distance yourself from what is going on even if you are living as far as in California,” Hamzawy said.

Su’a the semifinalist · Captains junior linebacker Su’a Cravens (above) and redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler were both named semifinalists for the Bednarik and Butkus, and Maxwell and O’Brien awards, respectively. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Trojans handed the Bears a 27-21 loss on Saturday, their 12th straight win over Cal. Sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson recorded his first career interception and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown. Redshirt senior Cody Kessler completed 80 percent of his passes, and freshman tailback Ronald Jones and redshirt senior tailback Tre Madden each rushed for a touchdown. The win was the fifth this season for the Trojans, making them one win shy of becoming bowl eligible.
The injuries continue to mount, however, as sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster fractured his hand in the win and underwent surgery on Monday to repair it. He is listed as questionable against Arizona.
USC got some good news this weekend, however, when T.J. Brock of Chaminade announced Sunday that he is committing to USC for football and track. Brock is a defensive back on the football field and is a state champion in the 100 meters.
On Monday, Kessler and junior safety Su’a Cravens were named semifinalists for national awards. Kessler is a semifinalist for the Maxwell and Davey O’Brien Awards, while Cravens is a semifinalist for the Bednarik and Butkus Awards. The Maxwell is awarded by the Maxwell Football Club to the nation’s top player. Kessler is one of 20 semifinalists. The O’Brien goes to the nation’s top quarterback. Kessler is one of 17 semifinalists. The Maxwell Club also presents the Bednarik, given to the nation’s top defensive player. The Butkus goes to the nation’s top linebacker.
WOMEN’S SOCCER
The women’s soccer team also faced Northern California teams, falling to Stanford on Thursday and beating Cal on Sunday. The Women of Troy fell to                         No. 4 Stanford 1-0 after Stanford scored in the 62nd minute and they were unable to respond. Goalie Sammy Jo Prudhomme had three saves in the match, but her team was unable to score the tying goal.
The team bounced back on Sunday, however, with a 1-0 win over Berkeley. The No. 16 Women of Troy beat the No. 20 Golden Bears thanks to a goal by sophomore midfielder Sydney Sladek. Prudhomme made five saves on the day to help lift her team past Cal. The Women of Troy are 13-5 overall and 8-2 in conference. They play their final game of the regular season on Friday at UCLA.
WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL 
The No. 1 women’s volleyball team lost its first game of the season on Friday, falling 3-0 to the No. 5 Washington Huskies. The loss snapped a 22-match win streak. USC was held to a .147 hitting percentage, its lowest of the season. The Women of Troy got another record performance from senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, but it was not enough to stop the Huskies. Bricio had 17 kills and 11 digs for her 11th double-double of the season.
USC escaped a two-game losing streak with a 3-2 win over Washington State on Sunday. Bricio put up 31 points on Sunday to help her team win a close five-set match on the road. Her performance elevated her to USC’s all-time points leader with 2,267. The Women of Troy will host Colorado on Friday. USC won 3-2 when these teams met in Boulder earlier this season.
MEN’S WATER POLO
The men’s water polo team joined the football and women’s soccer team in Berkeley, but unlike their fellow Trojans, they were unable to get the win. The No. 3 Trojans fell 12-10 to the Bears, their second straight loss. The Trojans dropped to 17-4 overall and 5-2 in conference. Blake Edwards and Mihajlo Milcevic tied up the game with a pair of goals, but the Golden Bears put up two late goals to hold off USC. The Trojans will try to fend off a three-game losing streak on Sunday when they host UC Irvine.
MEN’S TENNIS
Senior Max de Vroome picked up his first singles win of the season on Sunday at the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships in Westwood. Doubles pair freshman Kalman Boyd and redshirt sophomore David Laser made it all the way to the doubles final before falling 6-3, 6-3 to a pair from UC Santa Barbara. All eight USC entries won in the Round of 32 and five won the Round of 16. The Trojans will play next in the ITA Indoor Championships in Flushing Meadows, New York, on Nov. 12.

Before the season started, I wrote a column about how Cody Kessler is the most underrated quarterback in college football. At the time, I was basing my opinion on Kessler’s performance last season when he completed 69.7 percent of his passes and had 39 touchdowns to just five interceptions.
Kessler likely flew under the radar last season because his team went 9-4, a record that most USC fans would consider disappointing. Kessler seemed to be another extraordinary USC talent on an average USC team.
Kessler has faced more adversity in three years than most players face in an entire career. He was recruited by Lane Kiffin and has seen three head coaches following Kiffin. Despite facing these coaching changes, Kessler managed to stay consistent under center and be a reliable presence on the field.
Perhaps it is the dramatic way in which Sarkisian was fired, or the fact that he was facing yet another coaching change during his senior season or maybe even the difficulty of USC’s schedule this season, but Kessler has gone from an underrated quarterback to an average quarterback.
The Trojans faced much higher expectation going into this season than last, so obviously Kessler was no longer flying under the radar. He and the Trojans went from being the underdogs with a first-year head coach to the preseason  No. 8 team.
After winning their first two games by scoring nearly 60 points, Kessler and the Trojans suffered a loss to unranked Stanford and unranked Washington. They lost again at Notre Dame, though that loss came from a top-ranked rivalry and is less concerning. After losing another head coach and falling to 3-3, the Trojans have finally started to look like the team we all thought they’d be at the beginning of the season.
The Trojans upset the former No. 3 team in the nation in Utah and then beat Jared Goff and the Golden Bears on the road and have put themselves back in the Pac-12 South race. The Trojans are 5-3 and will need to win out and need Utah to lose again to win the South, but they definitely have the talent to finish 10-3.
With the likes of Kessler, Adoree’ Jackson, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Su’a Cravens, the Trojans aren’t lacking talent, but rather consistent leadership. Interim head coach Clay Helton has done a fine job of giving the team something to play for in the wake of the Sarkisian fallout. But the team needs more than just a head coach; they need a quarterback they can be sure of.
We already know that Kessler is an elite college quarterback — he proved that last season. Kessler is struggling this season compared to his numbers last season. He has already thrown five interceptions so far this season, the same amount he threw all of last season. But I think what Kessler is struggling with most is his confidence.
He threw two interceptions against Washington and two against Notre Dame. He seems to get rattled under pressure and make bad decisions. The team has won two in a row now and have found a rhythm under Helton, so Kessler just needs to calm down and find the poise and consistency that made him so great last season.
The Trojans have four games remaining this season and can absolutely win them all. Their toughest test will likely be against true freshman quarterback Josh Rosen and UCLA in the final game of the season. If Kessler plays with the confidence of a redshirt senior, there is nothing keeping the Trojans from a Rose Bowl.
Regan Estes is a junior majoring in public relations and Spanish. She is also the sports editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Wild Wild Westes,” runs Tuesdays.
The head coach of USC was a major failure this year, and it had psychologically undermined the performance of the talented Cody Kessler.  After the departure of Steve Sarkisian, USC seems to play like some of the best teams in the country.  The victories against Utah and Berkeley were not flukes.  Under the new coach, USC will fair very well in the rest of the season and will be a major bowl contender.  They will easily defeat UCLA this year under the new head coach.

Beating Baylor · Junior Karen Chung has shot for par through 17 holes against Baylor. The Women of Troy lead the semifinal match 4-1. – Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The No. 1 women’s golf team leads Baylor 2-1-2 at the East Lake Cup after one day of play in Atlanta, Georgia. The No. 3 men’s team is trailing Illinois 4-1. Monday’s semifinal matches were shortened due to rain and are scheduled to resume at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday with the finals slated for 10 a.m.
If the Women of Troy are able to close out their lead against Baylor to advance to the finals, they will face the winner of the matchup between Duke and Stanford. Duke currently leads Stanford 4-1. A loss will place the women in the loser’s bracket.
Should the men come from behind to beat Illinois, they will face the winner of the semifinal match between Georgia and LSU. The Bulldogs only need to close out a 4-1 lead tomorrow morning to advance.
“We certainly could be in better shape at this point in our matches,” men’s coach Chris Zambri said. “That being said, there is no reason why we can’t prevail tomorrow with some good golf on the back nine. I like where we stand.”
The men’s team is losing by one hole in four of its five matches. Sophomore Jonah Texeira maintains a par through 16 holes. Freshman Justin Suh and junior Rico Hoey trail by 1 through 13 holes. Senior Andrew Levitt also trails his Illinois opponent by one hole through 10 holes. Through nine holes, junior Sean Crocker is the fourth Trojan trailing by one.
On the women’s side, senior Kyung Kim gave the Women of Troy a win with a 6 and 4 win over Baylor. Freshman Robynn Ree is leading her opponent by three through 13 holes. She was the Women of Troy’s top finisher in two of their three events. Juniors Karen Chung and Tiffany Chan shot for par. Junior Gabriella Then trails her Bear opponent by one through 11 holes.
“It’s definitely a dog fight,” USC women’s coach Andrea Gaston said. “I don’t think you can ever predict the outcome of match play. It’s great to see Karen and Tiffany get their matches back to even on their last hole tonight. We hope we can finish strong in the morning.”
The Golf Channel will broadcast the final round of the men’s competition live. This is the last competition of the year for both teams. The men do not compete again until the Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii, on Feb. 4 while the women play again on Feb. 7 at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes.

Opera, not Oprah · Yelena Dyachek, a graduate student in the Thornton School of Music, sings an operatic piece for her Metropolitan Opera Council auditions on Nov. 1. Dyachek sang selections from Mozart and Tchaikovsky. – Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
On Nov. 1, two USC students were among the 13 finalists of the Western Region competition: soprano Yelena Dyachek and bass-baritone Andrew Dwan. The Western Region finals of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions were held in Zipper Hall at The Colburn School.
Dyachek, a graduate student in the Thornton School of Music’s Vocal Arts program, received first place in the Western Regional finals. Her win also came with a prize of $4,000 and the opportunity to advance to the competition’s semifinals. She spoke about her reaction just moments after her win.
“I’m absolutely in shock,” Dyachek said. “I don’t even know how to process my emotions.”
The Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions is regarded as one of the most prominent singing competitions in the world. Since its commencement in 1954, the sole purpose of the competition has been to discover young talent and foster the growth of future generations of opera singers. Winners of the competition often go on to celebrated and respected operatic careers.
There are four levels of the competition: the district level, regional level, the semifinals and the finals. Last year, approximately 1,500 singers competed at the district and regional levels, of whom 20 were selected to compete in the semifinals. Of those 20, around 10 singers advance to the finals, in which five to six singers were finally announced as national winners of the competition. Dyachek will compete in the semifinals in New York City this March.
Dyachek, a native of Ukraine, completed her master’s degree in vocal arts at USC last spring. She is currently receiving her Graduate Certificate in Vocal Arts under the tutelage of soprano Elizabeth Hynes, who Dyachek has also worked with for several summers at the Aspen Music Festival.
“I owe everything to [Hynes],” Dyachek said. “It’s reassuring to know that all this hard work is paying off.”
Dyachek presented “Come Scoglio” from Mozart’s Cosi fan tutte as her first selection, which she sang impeccably; Dyachek has a large voice that is well-suited for Mozart. The judges then asked Dyachek to perform an excerpt from Tatiana’s Letter Scene from Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin, which culminated with a large ovation from the audience.
Upcoming performances for Dyachek include the role of Vitellia in Mozart’s La clemenza di Tito in mid-November with USC Thornton Opera. She is also scheduled to perform the role of Der Komponist in Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos this spring, also with USC Thornton Opera. In addition, Dyachek will be featured in workshop performance of Frau Schindler, a new opera co-written by Vocal Arts department chair Ken Cazan.
Andrew Dwan, an alumnus of the Vocal Arts program, was also singled out among the singers; he received a special encouragement award and a prize of $1,500 to help further advance his vocal studies. Dwan currently resides in the Bay Area.
Dwan, a previous student of Hynes, is currently covering the role of Figaro in Opera San Jose’s production of The Marriage of Figaro. He said that the training he received at USC was invaluable.
“Ken Cazan’s direction [with acting] has helped me tremendously in the professional world,” Dwan said. “In addition, [Hynes] set me up with very solid technique — I finally feel like I’m beginning to understand my voice.”

And both of them are graduates of the undergraduate program in vocal performance of the Conservatory of Music at the University of the Pacific. Just sayin’…

Lights, camera, action · Actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are two producers of the HBO series Project Greenlight. Both served on a panel that selected contestant Jason Mann from a talent search to direct a movie. Filmmaker Effie Brown also served on the panel. – Photo courtesy of HBO
A couple weeks ago, news outlets circulated a video depicting a disagreement between Matt Damon and film producer Effie Brown on the HBO reality series Project Greenlight. This reality show centers on a group of professionals, including Damon and partner Ben Affleck, awarding an aspiring director $3 million in order to make his or her first feature film. In the video, Damon said that diversity quotas should only be taken into consideration when casting the actual movie, not when deciding who should win the $3 million. In response to Damon’s statement, Brown — a black woman with prominent film credits including last year’s indie darling Dear White People — guffaws loudly and responds, “Wow. OK.”
I hadn’t watched a single episode of Project Greenlight at that point — the only footage I’d ever seen of it was the video aforementioned. When the clip went viral and Damon was asked to apologize for his statement, I was on Damon’s side. I felt the people were too quick to point their fingers, and I truly believed that he was right in saying that the director chosen should be based on merit and merit only. I also felt that Brown was looking to pick a fight with Damon — her response seemed too inflamed and accusatory. It didn’t sound like she was listening — just merely reacting for the benefit of seeming like she was on her equality high horse in a sea of exactly the same type of white, upper-middle class men who are precisely the reason why Hollywood has such a diversity problem in the first place. In essence, I felt she was occupying a role she felt pushed into inhabiting, simply because no one else in the room would’ve done it. And that didn’t seem good enough to me.
This past week, SCA had a screening of The Leisure Class — the actual movie made in the show — followed by a Q&A with the winning director Jason Mann and producer Mark Joubert. The movie itself wasn’t without its problems. In fact, it was very flawed. But what I found most fascinating was the obvious tension during the Q&A. In a room with only a couple dozen people and the actual production of the series months behind them, Mann and Joubert didn’t seem to shake the bad blood accumulated during production. This led me to binge watch Project Greenlight in its entirety the day after Halloween, ultimately leading up to the actual finale of the show later that night. I had to find out what happened to cause such obvious discomfort in one of the most innocent of spaces, a screening room filled with film students in an institution of learning.
Throughout the show, a clear antagonistic relationship is created between Mann and Brown. The two are constantly butting heads in terms of production choices and money, culminating in Brown abandoning the reshoots of the project.
But beyond that, Brown is often portrayed as the bad guy throughout the series — she cracks the whip on time and budget and demands that more diversity be employed throughout the casting of the show. She does, in fact, do an admirable job of casting diverse employees below the line of production — the assistant director, location manager, film editor and production designer are all people of color, including a plethora of women behind the scenes who also are working on the project. However, Brown is also targeted as the odd woman out throughout the series. Whereas the other men throughout the show, such as Joubert, are almost depicted as silent, passive forces during production, Brown is loud and outspoken. When director Pete Farrelly, known for movies such as Dumb & Dumber and There’s Something About Mary, who was brought on to mentor Jason Mann, quits the project, it’s because he doesn’t like how Brown told him it wasn’t his place to pitch digital shooting to Mann. Farrelly cites wanting to avoid “drama” with Brown for leaving, but it really just seems like Farrelly didn’t like being put in his place by a woman.
Throughout the series, the camera crew also takes considerable time documenting Brown’s blunders. At one point, Brown is running around her office and subsequently trips and falls. Later, the camera includes several moments where Brown says she needs to eat her feelings away during the stressful production. The crew even manages to catch Brown gorging alone at crafts services. In a way, she’s “caught in the act,” and when she sees the camera filming her, she’s visibly upset. In a documentary series with hundreds of hours of footage and only a couple hours that can actually make the final cut, I wonder why the editors at HBO felt they needed to personally attack her. On the other hand, the process of casting the women in the film was left completely on the editing room floor. It might have been that the executives were so stretched for space and character in a sea full of bland men with nothing to offer the story that Brown was the only person to target. Or they needed to portray some sort of antagonist throughout the series, and therefore made the poor choice of choosing the only black woman in a position of high power in the show.
Granted, the argument could also be made that Brown was not without a bad side. Part of Brown’s goal throughout the series is to increase the diversity in a production that seemed like it didn’t allow for it. The Leisure Class in its essence is a movie about the 1 percent and how — despite their affluence, connections and privilege — they are just as complicated and messed up as any other family, if not more so. So in a story that occupies such a defined world, to add in diverse characters and background players would be to change the rules of the very society the film is trying so hard to comment on.
However, this argument doesn’t sit well with me, because as Brown points out during one part of the show, we’ve all seen the trope of the chauffeur or butler being played by a person of color too many times. Thus, Brown hopes to provide “a different narrative” in Hollywood going forward, which she absolutely should. The rules have been defined for decades by the very white men making most of the decisions throughout the show. They, in my opinion, did a very poor job with choosing the winning director in Mann, who is not only disrespectful, but ultimately makes a really flawed movie.
The dilemma with Brown also brings to mind a quote from The Devil Wears Prada, when Anne Hathaway’s character defends her strict boss played by Meryl Streep by saying: “If she were a man, the only thing people would talk about is how good she is at her job.” For some reason, I kind of have the feeling that in Brown’s case, the same would be true.

Scion is a unique brand in many ways. Not only are their cars relatively inexpensive, but they also feature something called Monospec, where cars have no trim levels. This makes the buying process simple, as buyers only have to choose if they want a manual or an automatic transmission with a choice of accessories. To help young buyers, Scion has a Gen-One financing program that can finance buyers even if they have limited or no credit history.
2016 Scion iA
The Scion iA is, without a doubt, the best new subcompact people can buy on the market right now — if you can get over the appearance of the front end. The Scion iA is essentially a Mazda2, which won’t be coming over to the States unless people buy one of these or the next generation Toyota Yaris. Mazda has been really pulling out the stops with the “Driving Matters” campaign and its SKYACTIV technology, and it really shows when one drives the iA. Despite having a small, 106-horsepower engine, the car is an absolute riot to drive. The slick six-speed manual has an excellent mechanical feel, making each gear change extra satisfying. The clutch is easy to maneuver, making manual driving easy for all skill levels. The steering, unlike most modern cars, feels like it’s actually bolted directly to the front wheels, making things like parking and canyon carving fun and easy. The infotainment system uses a touchscreen or rotary dial system, which is suspiciously similar to BMW’s iDrive system and is extremely easy to use. Despite the incredibly low price tag, it even comes with a low-speed pre-collision warning system. Unlike the iM, the iA features push-start ignition and automatic central locking come standard. The iA’s engine, much like the iM’s, is lacking in the power department. The iA’s tiny mill, however, has no problem moving the lightweight body around. Though it’s the best car from this year, it’s also the ugliest.
Verdict: A+
2016 Scion iM
The Scion iM is a hatchback version of the Toyota Corolla, sharing with it the same interior, engine and transmissions with it. Though it comes with a factory body kit and 17-inch alloy wheels as standard, it doesn’t drive the same way it looks. It’s still a Corolla underneath, so it has the handling characteristics of a house brick, with lots and lots of understeer which makes spirited drives disappointing. The suspension is stiffened up from the Corolla which makes it more uncomfortable than the Corolla. The iM comes with some unique standard features, such as power folding mirrors and dual-zone climate control, which make it a standout at this price range.
These features, however, don’t make up for how the car drives. The steering wheel is overly light and imprecise, leaving no idea what the front wheels are doing. The engine has virtually no power at the bottom end, which makes using the terribly designed manual shifter (a CVT is available) a huge chore. The driving position is only suitable for a gorilla and the pedals are all over the place. Though long overdue from the American market, the iM isn’t as good as its rivals from Ford and Mazda in terms of driving dynamics. Their engine produces less power than its rivals and despite offering some nice standard features, speed-sensitive automatic central locking are missing.
Verdict: C
2016 Scion FR-S
Though the Scion FR-S is the most expensive car in the Scion lineup, it is also the most exciting and most powerful. Unlike anything else in Scion’s lineup, it features rear-wheel drive, a Torsen limited-slip differential and a boxer engine producing 100 horsepower per liter. It distances itself from other rear-wheel drive coupes on the market by being much smaller, much less powerful and being much lighter. The small size means there is virtually no legroom in the back and the trunk is laughably tiny. The suspension is also incredibly stiff and can find bumps in even on the smoothest of roads. The steering is well-weighted and complements the car’s agile character by providing the driver with a great driving experience. The throttle is very sensitive, so people might find themselves occasionally over-revving or bogging the engine down while feeding the clutch. For 2016, they’ve updated the FR-S slightly with the addition of new colors, a new BeSpoke Audio head unit, a rearview camera and other features. Despite the impracticality, the Scion FR-S is a true sports car for the price, with a great community and a large aftermarket. For those looking at budget horsepower, this may not be up their alley. However, the Scion FR-S does cater to those who are looking for an old-fashioned drive.
Verdict: A-

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
Trojans breathed a sigh of relief as October came to a close. By Sunday, we had scrambled to put together and successfully rock our Halloweekend outfits and picked out our classes for next semester. Some of us received our LSAT scores and study abroad acceptance emails.
To top it all off, daylight saving time gave us another hour of sleep before we had to get up and continue to contemplate our futures.
For many, the future holds the decision of whether or not to turn their current relationships into long-distance ones. Yes, I am talking about the dreaded LDR. For those studying abroad, it may seem daunting to have a transatlantic relationship. The same goes for seniors — it’s hard to think about possibly working on a different coast as your significant other come graduation.
As a card-carrying LDR member, I can say that this is a discussion that no one really wants to have. It can end in one or two ways: yes or no. We will make adjustments or we will end things right now.
But luckily, long-distance relationships and millennials were seemingly made for each other.
It takes certain qualities to maintain a relationship from afar. You have to be selfless, giving and willing to put someone else before yourself sometimes. Basically, becoming everything that people say our generation is not, according to a Pew Research Center study. However, emerging technology, which was not afforded to previous generations, does make LDRs very possible. We just have to hone it properly to make it work in our favor.
Our generation isn’t the first group of young adults to grapple with the question of staying together or not. England’s Queen Victoria and Prince Albert wrote letters back and forth for years as they courted. When my parents were in college, they crossed the Illinois-Indiana border every month or so to visit each other. And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan communicated with each other over email in the 1998 film You’ve Got Mail.
Granted, those were under different circumstances and the Hanks-Ryan pairing was constructed by Hollywood, but my point is that long-distance relationships can work. If people could manage their love sending emails back and forth, then we millennials, who have so much more at our fingertips, can tough it out.
Our reliance on and readiness to use technology in all aspects of our life makes us more able to take on LDRs. We have FaceTime and Snapchat, which give us insight into our boyfriend or girlfriend’s day-to-day lives. Instagram and Facebook give us the highlights of their weeks. But there’s nothing like the freeflow of text messages that is built into any college student’s day. Gone are the days when we had to calculate how many incoming and outgoing texts we were sending a month — my limit in middle school was 400. Now, we can always connect with people no matter how far away.
This is even applicable while abroad. Many cell carriers have now gotten on board and offer affordable text messaging with their international plans.
A long-distance relationship for a millennial is possible.
So with this technology, it’s hard to pinpoint what is really keeping us from saying “yes.” One reason may be that a long-term relationship early on in our twenties is not a top priority for a lot of us today. We’ve seen the changing demographics that show that our generation is slated to receive higher level degrees, travel more and put off relationships and marriages until later in life. I think it’s more surprising for me to hear that one of my peers is getting married at 21 compared to a handful of my peers spending a year living in India — both have happened in the past few months.
Nothing is wrong with either decision; it’s just a sign of the times that priorities for us are changing. Millennials value freedom, and many times long-distance relationships don’t feel that way.
There’s nothing wrong with taking our twenties to “find ourselves.”
The continual messages we receive about using this time to “see the world” help us delay the age-old structure of developing healthy and meaningful relationships while we are young.
We shouldn’t let it.
So as you enter into your next phase of the school year, whether that is studying abroad or taking a job on a coast away from your boyfriend or girlfriend, make sure to weigh the options. Breaking up is hard to do, but missing an opportunity to learn how to love someone from a distance might prove even more difficult.
Millennials, as selfish as we can be, can find a space to add one more thing to our list of aspirations. A successful long-distance relationship can be that attainable goal.

Prior to the Undergraduate Student Government Senate’s vote in two weeks, I would like to take this time to affirm the Senate’s genuine commitment to addressing issues of diversity and inclusion on campus. As I stated on the Senate floor, our goal is to pass a resolution that is responsive, responsible and reasonable in calling for sustainable diversity initiatives. As written, the resolution would not have passed had we taken a vote last Tuesday. Therefore, please understand Greek Sen. Darian Nourian’s approved postponement is a good faith effort to reach a compromise, rather than a move to shut down the efforts of all who labored tirelessly in drafting the resolution. Like Graduate Student Government and the Faculty Senate, we welcome diverse students and faculty. However, we do not want to increase costs for future Trojans and neither do we want to increase debt for students that would have otherwise been covered by USC. We need to consider this resolution calls for $100 million to be spent and used for things like expanding administrative overhead and hiring expensively tenured faculty. President Rini Sampath made it clear she know how funding works. Yet, last Tuesday was not the first time Sampath has gone on the record to say that her focus is not on the numbers. Sampath has said in the past that “we can’t get stuck on the numbers,” and that she objects to “putting things into such a quantitative level,” when discussing financial issues.
Education is society’s greatest equalizer. Sen. Sanjay Mahboobani was quick to research and find information on scholarships like the Jewish Leadership Scholarship, LGBT, Latino and Black Alumni Associations, the Norman Topping Aid Fund — not to mention additional aid available per individual school, as well as a University Grant that can kick in when the Cal Grant does not. The Senate wholeheartedly supports bolstering these scholarships. However, the original resolution was not clear in whether it would use this existing infrastructure in place, or spend that money to also create a new system. This is the type of clarity that Sen. Eric Dubbury and I campaigned to demand from USG’s initiatives. Furthermore, the resolution did not demonstrate knowledge of how an endowment functions. As a student who interns for the Endowment Office, I share that only  5 percent of its current market value may be distributed back to USC for spending. This is a constraint we must recognize.
Though the resolution has somewhat readjusted the language that would have otherwise called for racial quotas, the unfair demands to control course curriculum in violation of academic freedom remain. Requirements to prioritize the critical race and queer theories over other relevant, yet dissenting scholarly perspectives in their fields reveals a bias in the Sampath administration’s goals.
The attacks the Sampath administration launched at the Senate meeting and over social media have been numerous. It is much more difficult to craft a responsive, responsible and reasonable resolution when the Senate is called “absurd,” or said to be in the same league as “old white men.” Framing certain concerns, such as those introduced by one of the greek senators and myself over the proposed curriculum reform, as insensitivity toward victims of sexual assault is distracting and hinders productivity.
Additionally, please understand senators have always been prepared to fund cultural resource centers and support Title IX initiatives, and these initiatives were never questioned.
It became increasingly troubling at the meeting that the Sampath administration led a rapid politicization of ethnicity. Supporting calls for impeachment and vehemently claiming that senate was derelict of its duty is not just constitutionally incorrect, it is also unprofessional. The Senate has the authority to postpone voting and to open negotiations with USG executives as an independent body; we are not yes-men ready to rubber-stamp anything from the executive.
We sincerely and respectfully ask Sampath to abandon the political bullying and engage in productive conversation, very much in the spirit of building upon progress already being made between two of our greek senators and resolution writers Sen. Sabrina Enriquez, Sophia Li and Shyann Murphy. We understand that Sampath has recently come out to state “constructive input is not only necessary, but also a vital part of our work.” We hope that Sampath will join us in staying true to that goal.
Giuseppe Robalino
USG Senator
This post has been updated for style and clarity.
Well said. Everyone knows diversity issues need to be addressed, but the details are incredibly important! And the wider buy-in from everyone on campus, the more successful changes will be anyway. Stop playing student politicians and being superior and realize that representing others should come with a huge amount of humility.

Dear Tiffany,
What are the best hiking spots you’ve been to in L.A./within a two-hour radius of L.A.? I want to get my hike on, but I’m a newbie to this whole being fit thing. 
Not going to lie, I avoided answering this question for a long time because I didn’t want to encourage increased traffic at my favorite hiking spots. After giving it another thought, I realized that my mom and the three other people who might read this post probably will not spill the beans to the world. Behold, my top three hiking recommendations in and around Los Angeles. 
Dear Tiffany,
What do I do if my roommate watches mukbang (a Korean eating show that shows people eating insane amounts of food) 24/7? I’m afraid she wants to eat me in my sleep. 

— Afraid of being eaten
After some light research, it doesn’t appear that mukbang stars encourage cannibalism, so I think you’re good for now. Be more concerned if she starts exhibiting dilated pupils and delirium.

Since the end of the era of iTunes and a decline in radio listeners, it has become increasingly hard to find good new music. Avid music lovers are constantly trying to search for new or hidden gems of songs in all kinds of places. Friends, family and, of course, the world wide web are all avenues through which one can explore new music. 
Blogs have become the most useful media outlet of our generation. There are bloggers who talk about almost every subject imaginable, one of the most popular subjects being music. There are several great blogs out on the internet that can help the starving music lover find some new tunes.  
One of the most socially significant blogs is Pitchfork. That name owes its fame to the huge festival held in Chicago every year, but the site holds much more relevance to the world of unknown music for curious fans. Pitchfork continues to debut and foster the knowledge of many independent artists, such as Bon Iver and Grizzly Bear. Though it can come off as pretentious at times, Pitchfork continually shines the spotlight on interesting and inspiring artists in the rock, indie and folk genres.
Another blog that continues to shock and awe readers is Popjustice. Though pop music has seemingly become a cliché that supports untalented, automatons in the music industry. Popjustice presents a diverse range of pop music that questions this contemporary notion. This blog will give you a wider range of sounds, even within the pop world, that will make you doubt your first thoughts about the genre itself. 
For EDM lovers, like myself, an interesting blog to keep up with is The Music Ninja. This blog features constant artist profiles on upcoming DJs along with exclusive and intimate interviews. This month feature Danish producer Galimatias, who has worked with singer Alina and rapper Nas.
Another indie music blog for the alternative mainstream is The Wild Honey Pie. Based in Brooklyn, this blog specially hosts, films and features hand-picked bands on its site, giving the whole blog a personal feel. The unique artists featured are some of the most interesting and likely unknown on the web but are sure to be featured in your future playlists. 
The internet has provided us with the medium of blogging for the exploration of the arts from a more personal perspective. Music blogs have come to be some of the most exciting and innovative ways for fans to find new music and discover new artists and bands. No matter the genre, there are hundreds of music blogs like the ones mentioned that can help you find your next favorite hit.
