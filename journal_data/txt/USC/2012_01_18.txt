The university unveiled last-week a new strategic plan to further develop its online programs, which aim to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world.
According to the Strategic Vision, USC will offer access to education to more people in order to meet the growing demand for educated workers.

“New modes of learning and societal needs require that we reinvent undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral education,” the Strategic Plan states. “Changing demographics and public demands require we provide greater access to, and accountability in, higher education.”
Binh Tran, the executive director of the Distance Education Network at the Viterbi School of Engineering, said the university has progressed toward the goal of providing education to more people by creating online programs with an emphasis on a professional education.
“We create programs, which, especially at the graduate level, are very much professionally based,” Tran said. “More than half of the current online programs have all come up within the past year, so you can see how there has really been a concerted effort by the university to offer degree programs that are geared toward professional education.”
Tran said the university has utilized its online programs to form partnerships with corporations where employees can use the online programs to become better educated and to gain a professional education.
“This year we’re graduating our first group of Kuwait Oil Company engineers,” Tran said. “The neat thing about this is that USC was able to educate people living in a country that doesn’t currently offer a lot of online programs.”
Dani Haberman, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said increasing the amount of online courses offered in the university will be beneficial for students because it will facilitate students’ abilities to further develop their knowledge without affecting their schedules.
“I’ve had experience with online courses from a community college and I found that they were better for specific learning styles and made creating schedules easier,” Haberman said. “I don’t see a downside to this because it could also make it easier for students to access classes from a scheduling standpoint.”
Lauren Schlessinger, a graduate student studying education, said the online classes currently offered by USC are extremely informative and supportive. By adding classes, the university could educate a larger number of people, she said.
“The common [misconception] about online classes is that you take a class behind a computer without any help, but in my program, it feels like you’re actually in a classroom that has similar discussions to any non-online course,” Schlessinger said. “The student support [in online classes] is great, and I honestly don’t see any downside to expanding the current programs.”
I actually looked into some of these programs and asked them more questions about the program itself. It turns out these programs are in fact very unique and has the same admissions requirements. Some online programs provide the off campus students access to the same faculty and class and online students could attend the class as well, but have the additional flexibility to participate online. All work and exams are done exactly in the same manner. It was a misconception to compare these offerings with other online programs as they are vastly different.
Online classes do water down the “prestige” of an SC degree. This is not the correct way to expand the “brand awareness” of USC. I thought that only community colleges, vocational schools, for-profit schools and the like did this…But now, I don’t know?. 
For professional school, I’ll opt for a school higher than SC.
What about watering down the value of an ‘SC degree?

Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, is slated to speak about Joining Forces, an initiative aimed at supporting military families and veterans, on campus today.
The Department of Defense Education Activity has funded a four-year $7.6-million project based at the USC School of Social Work to address military students’ special needs for financial support. Building Capacity in Military-Connected Schools joined San Diego State University, several Navy and Marine school liaison officers and a consortium of eight school districts around San Diego.
Kim Becker, a graduate student in social work involved with the program, will also speak at the event. Becker, a 20-year military spouse and parent, created a school-wide celebration at Jefferson Middle of the Marine Corps birthday School to raise awareness about the differences between military and civilian culture.
“Military students bring strengths into their schools and have unique life experiences that often go unrecognized,” Becker said. “Military students need to be recognized because they are proud, honorable and an asset to our public schools.”
About 1.2 million military children are enrolled in civilian public school districts, according to USC News. Building Capacity’s principal investigator Ron Astor, a professor of social work and education, and Victoria Downs, an eighth-grader whose father was deployed, will also speak.

Planning consultants, who are responsible for developing a plan to address bike issues at USC, unveiled a draft of their recommendations at a meeting in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom Wednesday.

In their presentation, consultants from Kendall Planning + Design identified four aspects of cycling that should be addressed: education and enforcement, campus bicycle access, bicycle parking and a campus circulation network.
The meeting was part of a daylong Bike Summit, which included a rally, an expo featuring bike-related organizations and breakout sessions. The recommendations include the addition of bike lanes, new parking racks, better signage and more limitations on biking.
“No decision has been made,” said Director of Orientation Programs Thomas Studdert, who is heading the bike campaign. “We are actively seeking the decisions of stakeholders. With that said, students need to provide that input.”
The consultants released two options for creating a bicycle circulation system. The first option proposes extending the dismount zone for cyclists and creating a 24-hour bike loop, including a bike lane on Trousdale Parkway. The second option, which would benefit pedestrians, expands the dismount zone even further and pushes bikers to the perimeter of campus.
“It is much needed for Trousdale to have a bike lane because it is one of the main thoroughfares through campus,” said Otto Hsiao, a sophomore majoring in business administration, after the presentation.
Both plans would restrict biking to main streets and would eliminate biking on narrow paths, including those near the Annenberg Building and Alumni Park.
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said he hopes the findings will encourage stakeholders to pay more attention to bike issues.
“We are now at the point where I hope people will pay even more attention to [bike issues] because they know we will be making some choices about pedestrian safety [and] bike safety,” Jackson said.
While Jackson ruled out the possibility of a total bike ban, he said changes to bike policy will definitely be made.
“There is no way we are going to ban bikes from USC,” Jackson said. “But we have to find a way to manage them better.”
Approximately 100 students, faculty and staff attended the presentation, which encouraged dialogue among the affected groups.
“What we are hoping is that … faculty, staff and students who are interested in this issue show up to hear about some of these ideas … and have an exchange of their thoughts about what USC can do to improve pedestrian safety and bike safety on campus,” Jackson said.
Consultants from Kendall Planning + Design also released results from a survey of more than 2,000 respondents. The consultants based their findings and recommendations on meetings with affected groups, data analysis and observations of bike culture on campus.
Los Angeles Police Department and USC Dept. of Public Safety data from 2006 to 2011 showed that many collisions occurred in the area immediately surrounding campus.
“We saw high rates of collision off of Orchard [Avenue], Hoover [Street] and University [Way], which was a particularly bad offender,” consultant Mark Simpson said during his presentation. “Data like this demonstrates a need to look at off campus as well.”
Jackson said he hopes the recommendations will be finalized by the end of the spring semester to allow time for the implementation of the policies.
“We’d like to get all this done by the end of spring so that when folks come in the fall, we’ll have a new, hopefully improved, way of dealing with bikes,” Jackson said. “We are really gearing up for the next academic year.”
Monique Ramirez, a graduate student studying education, said the Bike Summit was a productive meeting and highlighted the main concerns of bikers and pedestrians.
“Some of what they said was really good, like improving the bike lanes around campus and biker education in general, for both bikers and pedestrians,” Ramirez said.
The next summit will be held in April with updated recommendations.

Thanks so much for the great summary of the bike summit and our recommendations! There is still ample opportunity to contribute your thoughts about bicycles on campus. Log on to our website bikeusc.org for more info. Or you can email us directly at info@bikeusc.org. The more input we receive from Students, Faculty and Staff, the better.

The Trojans aim to end their longest losing streak since 2003 when they face Oregon (13-5, 4-2) at Matthew Knight Arena on Thursday. The Pac-12 matchup is the first of a two-game road trip for USC in the Beaver State, concluding on Saturday with a game against Oregon State    (11-7, 1-5).

The Ducks are coming off a 59-57 road victory against Arizona, handing the Wildcats their second home loss of the season. The Trojans, meanwhile, are trying to move on from a blowout loss against crosstown rival UCLA.
“We have to get back on track,” said freshman guard Alexis Moore, “It’s obvious we need a win, so our goal is to get better in practice every day.”
USC coach Kevin O’Neill echoed similar sentiments as his team geared up for a difficult inter-conference clash.
“Win or lose, your job is to do your job on every play, every single day,” O’Neill said. “That’s the way we approach practice, shooting, individual work, all of that.”
Even as the losses continue to pile up, the Trojans have maintained a positive outlook regarding their upcoming schedule.
“In terms of team morale, we still have to stick together and keep spirits high in order to finish out the rest of the season,” Moore said.
One point of emphasis for the Trojans against Oregon will be the rebounding battle, especially after getting dominated on the boards by the Bruins by a wide margin — 66-47.
“I’m going to have to start really focusing on [rebounding],” said redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon.
The Ducks are a veteran-laden team, starting three seniors and two juniors. Meanwhile, the Trojans are a much younger squad without any seniors logging significant minutes.
“[It’s] not just that [the Ducks are] older, they’re talented,” O’Neill said. “They’re playing well right now, and they’re playing at home. It’s going to be a challenge. We’ll have to play our best game to have a chance to win.”
In addition to their edge in the experience department, Oregon has multiple shooters whom the Trojans will need to keep from getting hot from beyond the arc.
“We basically have to run them off of threes and contest all their two-point jump shots,” Moore said. “Obviously they’re going to make some shots, but our goal is to try to minimize that as much as possible. We have to get up in them and pressure them and force the drive.”
Forward E.J. Singler, perhaps the Ducks’ biggest offensive threat, garnered high praise from O’Neill.
“I don’t think there’s any question. … He’s one of the best [in the Pac-12],” O’Neill said. “Singler is the guy that glues this team together, and he has a bunch of guys he’s played with that understand the game.”
After Thursday’s game, the Trojans will take on the Pac-12’s most potent offensive squad, Oregon State. The Beavers are averaging 82.7 points per game — tied for fifth-highest in the country and nearly 30 points higher than USC’s current output (53.6 points per game).
As the Trojans play out the two-game set against Oregon teams and move on in Pac-12 play, O’Neill has a message for disgruntled USC hoops fans in search of some victories.
“I understand [fans’] frustration,” O’Neill said. “I’m frustrated too, the players are frustrated … We appreciate their loyalty, we appreciate them cheering for their team.”

The Women of Troy (9-6, 4-1) return to the Galen Center to take on the Ducks (10-8, 2-4) tonight at 7 p.m.
Following USC’s 47-43 victory over UCLA at the John Wooden Center on Saturday, the Women of Troy have a chance to continue their strong conference play and maintain their second-place standing behind Stanford (15-1, 6-0) and ahead of California (13-5, 4-2) in the Pac-12.
Unstoppable· Junior guard Christina Marinacci scored eight points against UCLA. She also added seven rebounds, one block and one steal. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Oregon will come to the Galen Center averaging the 16th most points in the nation with 76.3 points per game, led by guard/forward Jasmin Holliday. To dispel the Ducks’ offense, USC hopes to maintain its reliable 3-point shot and efficient fastbreak game.
“We’re going to have to run them off the 3-point line and make them beat us with two’s,” senior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “We also have to limit our turnovers. Any team that likes to transition will take your turnovers and turn them into points.”
On the other end, however, the Ducks give up 78.1 points per game. The Women of Troy hope to exploit a shaky defense that has allowed at least 80 points in three of their last four games.
“We are a very difficult matchup for most teams because we shoot the ball very well and we have a lot of different sets,” USC associate head coach Laura Beeman said. “[We will] set some screens, move the ball around, let the ball find the open person and run right back at them.”
One of the key members of the USC offense has been senior guard Ashley Corral, who became the No. 5 all-time assists leader for the Women of Troy in their win over the Bruins. She nearly notched a triple-double in a 10-point, eight-rebound and eight-assist effort.
Corral’s emphasis on facilitating a balanced offense has encouraged a selfless mindset that the team has embraced.
“We’re really good at finding who’s open and I think we’ve done a really good job this season sharing the basketball and getting everyone involved,” Corral said.
The Women of Troy are 3-1 at home. Their last game at the Galen Center resulted in a 20-point thrashing over California on       Dec. 31. As for Oregon, they have yet to win a game on the road and have gone 4-8 after winning their first six games of the season.
USC has plenty of momentum with its longest win streak of the season, but the Women of Troy are being careful not to place too much pride on their recent success.
“We are where we should be, so it’s one step at a time, one game at a time,” Corral said. “I wouldn’t say we’re excited. We’re just looking forward to the future.”

When goalkeeper Joel Dennerley left the pool after defeating UCLA 7-4 on Sunday Dec. 4, 2011, he could call himself a national champion — four times over. Four national championships in four years.
Unheard of.
Champions · Senior goalkeeper Joel Dennerley and the USC men’s water polo team won their fourth consecutive national championship. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
In the grand scheme of college athletics, the Trojans’ four-peat is truly historic. There are few runs in college sports that have matched that of the USC water polo team. To put what the Trojans have done into perspective, here are a few of the great dynasties in college sports.
UCLA Men’s Basketball
From 1966-1973, the Bruins won the national title every year. For those counting, that’s seven straight. Under coach John Wooden, the Bruins had three undefeated seasons with 30 wins and lost a total of five games. Players such as Bill Walton, Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Sidney Wicks made the UCLA basketball dynasty.
USC Baseball
From 1970 to 1974, USC baseball won five straight national championships. Led by legendary Rod Dedeaux, the Trojans featured stars such as Fred Lynn and Jim Barr. Under Dedeaux, USC won a total of 10 titles.
Nebraska Football
Under coach Tom Osborne, Nebraska won three straight national championships between 1993-1995. Because college football does not have a playoff system, several different organizations hand out national titles. Before the BCS era, the AP was the most prominent. Osborne won two AP titles and one other from a lesser polling organization. Nevertheless, the team went 36-1 over three years.
Oklahoma Football
Bud Wilkinson led the Oklahoma Sooners to 47 wins in a row, which stands as a record in college football history. They won three out of four titles, including two from the Associated Press.
Princeton Men’s Lacrosse
From 1992-1998, Princeton won five out of seven championships, including three in a row.
Virginia Men’s Soccer
The Cavaliers won the national championship between 1991-1994. In four championship games, they did not give up a single goal.
Connecticut Women’s College Basketball
Led by Geno Auriemma, the Huskies won four titles between 2000-2004. From 2009 to 2010, they had a 90-game-winning streak.
When looking at some of the historic runs in college athletics, USC’s run of four straight titles in water polo is incredibly impressive. Over the past four seasons, the Trojans have lost a total of seven games, including an undefeated season in 2008-2009. Their roster was filled with numerous All-Americans, including Dennerley, who leaves USC as the school’s all time leader in saved goals.
Water polo might not be the revenue sport at USC, but there is no denying the incredible streak the team has been on over the past few seasons. In fact, there might not be a more underrated coach in all of college athletics than Jovan Vavic, who, since taking over 17 years ago, has won six men’s national championships, he’s accumulated a winning percentage of 86 percent and has been named the coach of the year on nine separate occasions by the NCAA.
Though other consecutive national champions have seemingly been honored and revered, the Trojans have been overlooked for the most part. Unless you’re an avid water polo fan, you might have missed the championships.
That, however, does not make it right. The Trojan legacy deserves to be remembered. It should not be cast aside because water polo is not one of the most popular sports on college campuses. It is just as legitimate as football or basketball in its competitive nature. In fact, the streak is as majestic as any in recent college sports memory.

The Gilbreath sisters always knew they wanted to play college basketball together.
When the sisters, senior guard Briana and redshirt junior guard Stefanie, looked at schools in Northern California during the recruiting process, they couldn’t agree on one they both wanted to play for. Once they got to Southern California, the only school on their radar was UCLA.
Back to basics · Women of Troy junior guard Stefanie Gilbreath is back in the lineup. Gilbreath was sidelined for her first three years at USC because of multiple knee injuries. She averages three points per game. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
But once the sisters saw the UCLA campus, they knew it wasn’t the right fit.
Though they were done with the West Coast and were ready to head back to their home in Texas, their cousin, a club basketball coach in California, told them they should visit USC.
After taking their cousin’s advice, the Gilbreaths were sold on becoming Trojans. And so began their sister act on the women’s basketball team.
With Stefanie constantly battling injuries throughout her last few seasons on the team, the journey hasn’t been an easy one for the Gilbreath sisters.
“It’s been a real roller coaster, with all the injuries, trying to get back,” Stefanie said. “But everything happens for a reason, and I’ve had a great team be there with me. My team, trainers, coaches, my sister, my family — they have all been very supportive and I probably wouldn’t even be here without them.”
But after three years of sitting out because of various ailments, Stefanie is finally getting some playing time this season.
“I’ve been waiting a long time to play alongside her,” Briana said. “For me and her personally, it’s good for us. We get that feeling of being on the court just like we were in high school, and it’s a bond that really can’t be replaced.”
Stefanie also expressed happiness in being able to play alongside her younger sister again.
“There’s always been that one year when we don’t play together, but for it to be three years or two years, it was really weird,” Stefanie said.
Getting back on the court and reaching her full potential won’t come automatically for Stefanie, and she is well aware of the fact that she can’t do it alone.
“Now it’s starting to come together,” Stefanie said. “My teammates have been working with me to make sure I know all the plays. They have been helping me get back to what I know and how I played.”
With Stefanie back in action and Briana already a leading scorer for the Women of Troy, the Gilbreath sisters are certainly back in business. The idea of two sisters playing on the same college team isn’t unheard of, but it is rare. Even more rare, according to Briana, is leaving Texas to play a college sport elsewhere.
“Growing up in Texas, it’s all about sports in general,” Briana said. “Everyone loves sports. It’s really tough to get out of Texas. You have Texas A&M, University of Texas, Texas Tech, Baylor and all these different schools that try to get you to not leave Texas. It’s tough to leave the area and go somewhere else, especially California. It was a tough decision, but I think we made the right one.”
This season, which was rocky at first for the Women of Troy, brought with it the third-toughest schedule in the nation, according to RealTimeRPI.com, and some hard losses in the preseason. Regardless of the troubles USC faced at the beginning of its journey, recent wins — including a narrow victory over UCLA — have given the team new momentum.
“At first it was kind of rocky but we have to remember we played a lot of top-25 teams in the preseason,” Briana said. “We learned from our losses obviously, and we started off the Pac-12 pretty strong. We have really found our identity as of lately, and it is going really well.”
Now that Briana is in her last year and Stefanie is in her second to last year, the two Women of Troy share yet another goal for the future: to play in the WNBA. With such a long history of togetherness behind them, it probably wouldn’t be surprising to anyone if they played professional basketball as a duo as well.

It’s difficult to rise to fame in the comic book industry with hundreds of writers, artists, designers and editors trying to break in and hit the big time, even when the ultimate success rate isn’t that high.
There’s a perception that a graphic artist can just shop around some work, get on a smaller title and take on flagship series as if they were the second coming of Alan Moore or Jack Kirby. That’s partly why artist Sean Murphy’s recent blog post fueled so much discourse.
Murphy’s post, titled “5 Year Plan,” called on all aspiring creators to be assertive and ignore the unofficial, so-called “protocol” that has become the norm.
But Murphy, whose recent work includes Grant Morrison’s Eisner Award-nominated Joe the Barbarian and American Vampire spinoff Survival of the Fittest, said his blog post came out of a desire to help get art students to think outside the box.
“Because of the nature of my work, my vocal reputation and the fact that I’m getting paid to write for myself, I think my position in comics is unusual,” Murphy said. “I owe it to people to describe what I’m seeing from where I stand. My thoughts are worth nothing unless I write them down — even if it upsets a lot of other professionals, which my blogs often do. It’s worth it for me to piss off one professional if it helps 10 students.”
Murphy feels that comics, like other media, suffer from a majority of projects being average. Artists and writers aren’t doing enough to innovate the industry.
To try to make up for that, he tries to infuse his art — inspired by the expressionist art of Sergio Toppi and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes fame) — with extreme movement to give readers engaging visuals that do more than just layout the story.
“It’s hit and miss at times, but I always give it my best effort,” Murphy said.
For Murphy, doing what you love as an artist, rather than jumping onto different projects, was key to furthering his career and solidifying his artistic style.
“Branding, to me, is based off a simpler question: What gigs make me happy?” Murphy said. “There’s a through-line in the projects I enjoy, and once I realized what that through-line was, I started to see my brand. For example, I don’t enjoy drawing superheroes — I love sci-fi, action adventure, history, noir and more contemporary genres.”
That made it a bit harder to get on series, but it ended up pushing him toward more creator-owned organizations.
“Simply turning down projects that didn’t fit [certain] criterion landed me on books that I really enjoyed — books that fit my brand. Branding isn’t a chore, it’s figuring out what you want to be ‘about’ while adding a marketing sense,” Murphy said.
And though he’s created his own brand with frightening runs on Vertigo, DC Comics’ mature imprint, he finds it surprising, admitting he was never a big fan of the horror genre starting out, even though it has become a part of his artistic brand.
“There are two reasons why I’ve ended up doing more horror lately: One, a lot of my publisher’s stuff is horror-based, and two, because my style uses a lot of messy shadows and scratchy black line work, so it’s easy to make the leap and go, ‘this guy should be doing horror,’” Murphy said.
But those projects ended up being titles with creators he wanted to work with, and that fit in with what he wanted to do with his career.
“Even though I’m not into horror, I loved doing Hellblazer and American Vampire — maybe I’m a horror fan and don’t know it,” Murphy said.
“5 Year Plan” offered a very candid look into the industry — not the business side, but the traits artists and all creators need to better their talent and keep comics from growing stale, as evidenced by Murphy’s career.
Comics are sometimes looked at dismissively with an “anyone-can-do-that” view, but it takes skill, luck and focus to get into the market, even outside of the bigger-name publishers.
And Murphy, an artist who has established himself, says he’s sticking to original content at the moment.
“Right now I’m working on my creator owned book for Vertigo called Punk Rock Jesus about a clone of Jesus that turns into a rebel and joins an atheist punk band,” Murphy said. “After that, I’m not really sure yet.”

“Spine of the Earth 2012”
Sunday, Jan. 22, 12-2 p.m.
Nothing exemplifies a lazy Sunday afternoon more than avant-garde performance art, right?
Maybe that idea doesn’t conform to the typical norm of a carefree end to the weekend, but “Spine of the Earth 2012” is one modernist art installation you won’t want to miss.
The project came to fruition when Santa Monica’s 18th Street Arts Center asked Lita Albuquerque to restage “Spine of the Earth,” a land work originally made in 1980 that incorporated red pigments used to form geometric shapes in the El Mirage dry lake bed.
This weekend the recreation will take place at The Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook but will use 500 volunteers in red robes instead of red pigments, so as to avoid staining the trails. A skydiver will fly over the volunteers to capture an aerial view.
What was once an interaction between art and nature has now added a new element: people. “Spine of the Earth 2012” has adapted, transforming into a modern work of art and a tribute to nature, thus making it all the more beautiful.
 
Georges Méliès Shorts Program
Sunday, Jan. 22, 5 p.m.
You might recognize the name Georges Méliès if you saw Hugo, Martin Scorsese’s critically acclaimed film. Scorsese’s fantastical treatment of Méliès is appropriate because the man himself was a bit magical: Méliès previously worked as a theatrical showman, thrilling spectators with illusions and stage tricks.
Of course, Méliès’ true legacy lies within his innovations in the world of filmmaking. Méliès created many film production techniques such as time-lapse photography, split-screens and dissolve transitions, techniques that are often taken for granted today. Though his filmmaking career ended in bankruptcy as the novelty of his movies wore off, his contribution to the cinematic world cannot be understated.
Sunday’s event at the Aero Theatre will feature Méliès’ films — many of them rarely seen — with live musical accompaniment. The Georges Méliès Shorts Program looks to be an event perfect for anyone with a fascination of the origins of moving pictures.
 
Wu-Tang Clan at Club Nokia
Saturday, Jan. 21, 9 p.m.
Can the history of gangsta rap or the concept of the hip-hop collective be mentioned without mentioning Wu-Tang Clan?
The answer is no. Current rap collectives, such as Young Money and OFWGKTA, probably wouldn’t exist without Wu-Tang Clan, who used the group to kick-start individual careers and profit from the music industry as efficiently as possible.
The seminal Staten Island crew has been terrorizing the rap scene since 1993, and now they’re back to give Los Angeles a taste of old school rhyming. All the existing legendary original members, such as RZA (Robert Diggs), GZA (Gary Grice) and Ghostface Killah (Dennis Coles), will be at Club Nokia to unleash their unique flows and lyrical styles.
The show promises to be a packed event with additional live music from DJ Ivy.
 
“The Super Serious Show” 
Thursday, Jan. 19, 8 p.m.
It’s only the second week of school and students are already overwhelmed, nervously looking ahead to midterms and papers. The Super Serious Show provides students with a much-needed comedic break.
The monthly show, produced by Joel Mandelkorn, Betsy Koch and Mandee Johnson, incorporates an exuberant mix of standup and musical comedy, as well as brief character bits.
The laugh-out-loud event has featured many greats, including Sarah Silverman and Demetri Martin. This month’s performance will present an equally talented lot consisting of Johnny Pemberton, T.J. Miller, Mary Lynn Rajskub (yes we’re talking Chloe from 24), Sean Conroy and Barry Rothbart.
The riotous comedy event takes place at Café Club Fais Do-Do and tickets cost $13 to $20, depending on whether they are purchased in advance. Plus, there’s free wine and beer.
Take a break early in the semester and get ready to laugh.

Let’s face it: Mall food is hardly considered exciting, and the term is often synonymous with fast-food joints such as Panda Express and Taco Bell.
Penne perfection · Post & Beam’s oven-baked pasta, topped with arugula, Parmesan and short rib Bolognese, packs a deliciously flavorful crunch and shines as an updated take on a tried-and-true classic. - Jasmine Ako | Daily Trojan
 
Shaking up the notion of a neighborhood mall joint is Post & Beam, a new eatery serving up seasonal Californian cuisine located in back of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw shopping plaza.
Slightly out of place next to a Fatburger, the new restaurant sits brightly in the old space left by the fast-food chicken chain Golden Bird. But that shouldn’t deter anyone from giving it a try.
Though Post & Beam has its share of flaws, it adds a fresh pinch of pizzazz to a neighborhood not historically thought of as a destination for trendy, delicious dining experiences.
Post & Beam is a new culinary concept led by restaurateur Brad Johnson of Georgia and BLT Steak, Executive Chef Govind Armstrong of Table 8 and 8 oz. Burger Bar, and Director of Operations David Borrego, who has whipped things into shape at The Raymond and Morton’s.
The restaurant has a focus on fresh, local ingredients and in will tailor its menu toward its outside herb and vegetable garden.
And now the important part: the menu, separated into intros, hand-stretched pies (pizza), larger plates (entrées) and small plates (sides), provides mixed results.
The oven-roasted penne with short rib Bolognese, arugula and shaved Parmesan is a delectable appetizer with components that complement each other beautifully. The genius touch on the dish is the decision to oven-bake the penne, which gives the pasta a unique crispy texture that surprisingly crunches with every bite.
Another hit is the cast-iron natural chicken with olive oil, poached garlic and sage, a main entrée that seems to be a mouthful of fried chicken but is actually just pan-seared on both sides.
And if you go for the pizza, try the wild mushroom, California goat cheese and nettles option and savor the crackling crust balanced against the exceptional blend of toppings.
The impressive side dishes consist of choices such as melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes and black-eyed peas with sweet potato and house-smoked bacon, the latter having a perfect balance of texture, salt and sweetness.
Not everything on the menu works though. The grilled octopus with garbanzo beans, preserved lemon and cracked olive is ambitious in its choice of ingredients but puzzling in its execution, and the popular boneless beef short ribs with fresh horseradish is surprisingly one-note in flavor — and in this instance was slightly dry, to boot.
The grilled beer-brined pork chop with charred onions, although flavorful, was also dry and overcooked — an easily avoidable mistake.
Post & Beam has generated strong buzz in a short span of time, as indicated by the 45-minute wait some customers must endure on busy weekends, though the delay could also be a sign of slow service.
While waiting for a table, however, guests are invited outside to the patio to sip on beer and wine. State-of-the-art heating lamps provide warmth and a charming playlist of jazz tunes, including tracks by Amy Winehouse and a guitar instrumental of the Beatles’ “I Love Her.”
Post & Beam especially scores brownie points on ambiance, with an interior full of warm, deep-wood hues that’s lit by the open-hearth fire inside and small candles at each table. Especially unique is that Post & Beam keeps the old Golden Bird’s structure. The pre-existing space was stripped down to its studs and load-bearing walls — instead of being completely rebuilt — to maintain the original “post and beam” style that many homes in the Baldwin Hills area had in the 1950s and 60s.
The atmosphere inside, however, is surprisingly loud given the upscale nature of the restaurant. Guests can hardly hear each other over the din of others’ voices, and this crowd noise also renders the great jazz playlist hardly audible.
The service at Post & Beam makes up for it: The waiters are incredibly friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu and cooking techniques and are notably eager to please.
Despite some culinary hiccups, the minds behind Post & Beam should be commended for bringing a fresh, hip dining concept to the Baldwin Hills area. With the garden on its way and a continued pursuit of quality, Post & Beam could soon become another classic part of the neighborhood — structure and all.
 
this place is pretty good.  nice to have some different options in the area.  this ones a first.

Going to breakfast with friends is no longer just about chatting over pancakes. I also need to check into the restaurant on Foursquare or Yelp and snap pictures of my food on Instagram. All the while, I frantically plot a new Facebook status in my head.
An overarching sad realization hits: Since when did we become so obsessed with using technology to document our lives?
Social media is easy to abuse. Though we should not ignore its potential drawbacks, social media is ultimately a good thing. It merges the digital world and real world in novel ways that bring us together.
Smartphone apps — such as Foursquare, Yelp, Find My Friends, Instagram and Facebook — are all about publicizing exactly where you are and what you’re doing. There’s no avoiding the fact that in today’s world we are more connected than ever and constantly create online versions of ourselves.
We are also more narcissistic than ever. Instagram, which encompasses photography and self-projection, nabbed Time magazine’s award for “iPhone App of the Year” in 2011.
The creators of Facebook were wise to give us the option of removing people from our newsfeeds. Friends or otherwise, some people simply post too frequently. If you’re guilty of constantly updating your status, try disconnecting every once in a while. Don’t focus on your online persona at the expense of real life.
Location-based services such as Foursquare, however, provide unique advantages. On several occasions, location and documentation applications on my iPhone have allowed me to keep in touch with people that I wouldn’t see otherwise.
As the overlap between the online and real world continues to grow, it’s essential to recognize the dangers of over-sharing and being obsessively connected. But it’s also essential to recognize and take part in the best parts of technology — the ones that truly bring people together, inspiring creativity and interaction in a way that has never been done before.

Following Wednesday’s Bike Summit and DPS Safety Fair, a group of LAPD officers on bikes happened to be predatorially perched on Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue, ready to cite law-despising cyclists.
While it might not be right for officers to prey on bicyclists, it’s also not right for bicyclists to completely ignore standards of etiquette and safety.

Hopefully, events like the Bike Summit, which introduced two potential plans for bike safety reform, will take care of these concerns.
We live in fast times, so we live in fast ways. We rush to class and speed to work. As heuristic humans, we tend to develop quicker and more convenient ways to do virtually anything. From putting all that connects us — personally, nationally, globally — on one smartphone to multitasking daily regimens, we constantly strive for efficiency. But we rarely think of safety.
Students ride against traffic, occasionally while having a phone conversation. These aren’t handless Bluetooth or headphone conversations. No, these are conversations that require one hand to be kept off the handlebars.
Perhaps I underestimate the cycling ability of the average Trojan. But after seeing several students nearly get plowed by cars, I can only conclude that these reckless routines need to change.
Last semester, I caught sight of a student riding her bicycle while talking on her phone. Her right hand held the phone, and her left hand held the handlebar. She made a left turn onto Jefferson Boulevard against traffic.
At the same time, a bus barreled around the corner in the opposite direction. Needless to say, she jumped off her bike, tossed her phone, tucked and rolled. She got up, bedraggled and disturbed. In an upset tone, she asked those around her, as they slapped grass and grime off her back and hair, if they had seen the license plate of the crazed busman.
After witnessing what could have been a horrific scene, I have no choice but to take the side of the ticketing officers, though I do not agree with their vulture techniques.
Using precious resources to have people stand on corners and hand out citations seems excessive. Citing bicyclists just teaches them to be more vigilant. We think we don’t need to change our habits; we just need to become wary of our surroundings.
Yet above all, with all this talk of a bike-friendly university, safety should be our top concern.
More instances of safety hazards include cyclists who tailgate pedestrians on narrow sidewalks, then becoming upset when unable to pass. Because of the lack of racks, students often park their bikes around building entrances, making it a nightmare to enter and exit.
Many different mediums exist to educate the habitual cyclist.
For instance, investments should be made to Facebook, Twitter, email, signs, fliers and education programs that allow students to quickly reference bicycle rules and regulations. Half of these mediums exist on smartphones. Why not take advantage of that?
For starters, the university should develop small pamphlets using summarized versions of the safety precautions from the student handbook. These pamphlets should also be accessible online.
At the end of the day, however, students need to take some responsibility. Anyone can quickly search online for local bicycle laws on bicyclela.org, which has an exhaustive list of bicycle laws and etiquette tips.
Most students ride bikes around campus — as anyone who has ever crossed the treacherous Trousdale Highway can tell you — so why aren’t more students motivated by this Bike Summit? If you visit the bikeusc.org website, you will notice that its Facebook page has only a whopping 11 “likes.”
Maybe cyclists don’t have time. Maybe their fast lives don’t allow for a half-day commitment to the Bike Summit.
Whatever your reason is for not making it, all cyclists should take the time to educate themselves. It might save your wallet. It might save your life.

We love your ideas for the university to help students learn more about bike safety.  In fact, we produced a map of current bike dismount zones with Bike Safety Tips and graphics for the summit, and would like to find campus groups willing to disseminate it widely.  We’ll also post it online at http://www.bikeusc.org.
One of the interesting findings in our study is that many students do not know much about rules of the road for bikes, nor do they know urban cycling tips that can help them negotiate the congested streets and pathways on and around campus.  Yesterday we took a group of 25 USC graduate student for a quick “bike safety tour” of campus.  Seeing 25 cyclists with helmets obeying all stop signs and restrictions made most people stop and stare in disbelief.  We’d like to see a strong “Bike Ed” program implemented on campus so more students can learn how to bike safely and considerately.
Great ideas! We’re definitely interested in developing a robust educational program that gives students the foundational knowledge and skills to be safe and confident cyclists. Rather than ‘gotcha’ enforcement, we would like to see a more targeted crackdown on the most dangerous behavior. There may be opportunity to integrate an educational component into enforcement, such as requiring scofflaw cyclists to take a bike safety course rather than pay a fine.
We’d love to hear more from the Trojan community! You can connect at http://www.bikeusc.org or email us directly at info@bikeusc.org.
why yes, I ride a bike, like any sensible person who doesn’t want to spend half an hour getting anywhere. your point being?
That you’re a douche.
Jack ^ is definitely a bike rider.
sounds like you have no friends. LAPD has better things to do than cite students for frivolous bike violations, like busting the actual criminals in the neighborhood and keeping us safe. it’s a shame the officers have resorted to handing out absurd tickets to collect donut money.
you must be a bike rider.

Rumors about Fall Out Boy planning a show in Lancaster, PA. spread like wild fire throughout the internet last week.
After years of waiting for Fall Out Boy to end its hiatus, hopeful fans are continuing to wait after band members, Pete Wentz and Joe Trohman, confirmed on Twitter that the rumors were false.
Although each member of Fall Out Boy has branched out to work on other projects, the question about whether or not the band will ever make music together again is still up in the air.
In a recent CNN.com interview, Wentz said, “Right now I couldn’t picture playing music with Fall Out Boy or playing Fall Out Boy songs, at all.” He continued on to say that they are tighter now as friends than when they first went on hiatus.
Black Cards, Wentz’ band, split from its vocalist Bebe Rexha at the beginning of this week, but the band plans on releasing a mixtape in the near future.
Wentz is not the only one dealing with change. Trohman announced on his Tumblr that his band, The Damned Things, which Fall Out Boy member Andy Hurley is also in, will most likely not be doing anything in 2012. But while that project is put on hold, another one is being born.
Trohman is starting a new band called With Knives, which will be recording an EP next month.
