Facing the nation’s eighth-best passing attack might be a source of significant concern for a lot of teams. But having already faced two other top-10 passing teams in Oregon State and Washington State, the Trojans feel well prepared for the “Air Raid” offense they will face in Berkeley this Saturday.

“There’s a little bit of carryover,” redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said. “They’re a powerful offense. We’ve got to eliminate explosion plays and affect the quarterback.”
The Trojans more or less did just that against Oregon State. The Beavers were actually the leading passing attack in the nation before USC’s 31-14 victory last Friday, averaging more than 420 yards per game through the air. But a mere 277 yards passing dropped the Beavers’ average by more than 15 yards, dropping them behind Baylor and Texas Tech.
“It was a big boost,” USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron said about the secondary’s performance against Oregon State. In addition to the 277 yards allowed, the defense also recorded three interceptions. “But again, it’s a new week. We can’t let our hands down. [Cal] will throw the ball vertical, and they have some speed.”
Unlike the Beavers, who were considered one of the top teams in the Pac-12, the Bears are just 1-8. And with a grudge match against Stanford on the horizon the following Saturday, it would be easy to overlook Cal.
“We’re in the mode of one game at a time and one day at a time,” Orgeron said. “And hopefully we can stay focused on that.”
USC hasn’t lost to Cal since 2003, when the unranked Bears stunned the top-ranked Trojans in triple overtime. USC went on to win 34 straight games after that, but that doesn’t ease the pain for Orgeron, who was USC’s assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator at the time.
“I will always remember that day,” Orgeron said. “We walked into a snake pit. We didn’t play very well and we tried to catch up and we couldn’t. That was a devastating loss.”
Breslin out
Orgeron announced that senior linebacker Morgan Breslin will have surgery on an injured hip. He’s expected to be out for “an extensive period of time,” but Orgeron left open the possibility of him returning for a later game, possibly a bowl game.
“In my 27 years of coaching, he’s actually one of my favorite players I’ve ever coached,” Orgeron said of Breslin. “He’s just a fantastic young man. Totally dedicated to football. Great player, obviously. And I just loved his attitude.”
In other injury news, sophomore defensive lineman Leonard Williams was surprisingly held out of practice with a shoulder ailment. Orgeron deemed him questionable for Saturday.
Junior cornerback Anthony Brown and junior tight end Randall Telfer are both out with knee injuries. Sophomore running back Tre Madden is out with a hamstring, as is senior linebacker Marquis Simmons with a back injury. Senior offensive lineman Kevin Graf is probable despite a bad ankle.
Those seven injury concerns are still quite a bit fewer than just a few weeks ago, something not lost on Orgeron.
“I feel like the line is a bit thicker, especially on offense,” Orgeron said. “We’re feeling healthier and more confident.”

With eight games to go in conference play, No. 4 USC is at a crossroads: Should the team take its foot off the gas until the NCAA tournament or go pedal to the metal and try to run the table in the Pac-12? USC head coach Mick Haley hopes to find a happy medium as his team heads into the final month of the season.
“November is a critical month,” Haley said. “We want to be as good as we can be. We need to keep getting better. We have to take it one game at a time and we’re working on some new and different things.”
USC’s first match in November was against Cal last Friday evening. In that match, the Women of Troy (20-3, 10-2) saw their offense open up in new ways and ended up winning in four sets. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio recorded five service aces in the match to go with 25 total points and four total blocks, while senior libero Natalie Hagglund stole the show on defense with 36 digs. Both players went on to win Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week honors, respectively.
Next on USC’s radar will be their conference foes from the state of Oregon. The Women of Troy will take on the unranked Oregon Ducks this Friday before turning around to play the unranked Beavers of Oregon State on Sunday morning at the Galen Center. When USC last met with these opponents, they swept both matches on the road. This time around, they will need to be wary of falling into a trap against teams who are better than their records might indicate.
“Practice this week is going to be really important,” Hagglund said. “Doing all the little things and being able to execute is going to be really big. Oregon has some really good players; they have an All-American setter and outside hitter. But we really have to focus on ourselves. If we focus on us, we’ll be okay.”
Hagglund — herself a 2012 All-American — is referring to Oregon setter Lauren Plum and outside hitter Alaina Bergsma, the two most prominent players on a very talented Oregon roster. Since the teams last squared off, the Ducks (13-9, 6-6 Pac-12) have split six matches, winning three and losing three.
Resiliency will have to be the key for the Women of Troy. The Ducks often win matches in sweeps and are rarely swept when they lose, usually managing to clinch one or two sets before succombing to defeat.
Oregon State (9-14, 0-12), on the other hand, is having an extremely rough season in conference play. The Beavers have not won a match against a Pac-12 opponent, and their home loss to USC on Oct. 11 was just one of their 12 conference losses this season.
Friday’s match against the Ducks will begin at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center and will not be broadcast. Sunday will present the Women of Troy with a rare morning matchup, as they will take on the Beavers at 11 a.m. at the Galen Center; the match against Oregon State will be broadcast on Pac-12 Networks.

I am pretty sure OH Alaina Bergsma aka Miss Oregon 2012 already graduated and no longer playing for the Ducks this year…

As the cliché goes, “The games you remember are played in November.” And if you’ve followed USC football — or college football in general — even peripherally for the last decade or so, you’ve heard the stat: Pete Carroll’s USC Trojans were 29-1 in the month of November throughout his illustrious tenure.
It actually is quite impressive. Consider the fact that Ohio State lost four November games in the nine years that Carroll was at USC (2001-2009). Texas lost five games, Oklahoma six. Even Boise State, with all of that program’s success, still lost three November games, and they played in a lesser conference.
The record that USC put up is impressive enough in and of itself, but it is more impressive still for what it represents. Those USC teams, as talented and dominant as many of them were, actually got better as the season entered crunch time. When you’re in the running for a BCS Championship, as, again, many of those teams were, each game becomes progressively more magnified. A loss in Week 10 is much more crushing than a loss in Week 3, no matter the opponent. And so, without fail, those teams rose to meet each challenge on the biggest stage.
Nov. 17, 2001: unranked USC knocks off No. 20 UCLA 27-0.
Nov. 30, 2002: No. 6 USC dispatches No. 7 Notre Dame 44-13.
Nov. 1, 2003: No. 3 USC handles No. 6 Washington State 43-16.
And how about November 2006: the Trojans beat No. 21 Oregon, No. 17 Cal and No. 6 Notre Dame by a combined 59 points, including a 44-24 victory over the Irish.
Since Carroll left, USC is 8-5 in November. That’s 7-5 under Lane Kiffin and 1-0 under Ed Orgeron. And that one win — last Friday up in Corvallis, Ore. — was the most Pete Carroll-like win since Uncle Pete himself ran out of town. The dancing, the chanting, the smiles and laughter. To use the word for surely the billionth time in the month-plus since former head coach Lane Kiffin was fired: just plain fun.
Based on this year’s calendar, close to 40 percent of the season will be played in November (or if you’re buying into the so-called “eight game schedule” post-Lane Kiffin, nearly two-thirds). And look at what those games are.
Last Friday’s win (on Nov. 1, mind you) over the Beavers exorcized a lot of demons — not necessarily for this Trojan team, but for the program as a whole. Road trips to bottom feeders Cal (this weekend) and Colorado (Nov. 23) are forgettable. But sandwiching those two: UCLA, a game that needs no further explanation, and Stanford.
If Oregon State exorcized demons for the program, a win over Stanford would do so for this 2013 team specifically. And the 2012 team, and 2011, and 2010 and 2009. That’s how long the Cardinal has had the Trojans’ number. In fact, Pete Carroll’s only November loss as USC head coach came against Stanford in 2009: the infamous “What’s your deal?” game when No. 25 Stanford smacked No. 9 USC all around the Coliseum.
The matchups against the Cardinal and the Bruins were, even at the start of the year, the two most important on the schedule. The fact that they take place at the end of the season — in November — only magnifies that.
There’s no national championship to play for this year. There’s no Pac-12 Championship or Rose Bowl on the horizon either, not without a whole lot of help and a whole lot of luck to go with it. But this is still November. That used to mean something special around here. And that alone is purpose enough.
The games you remember are played in November.

If we win 3 of these last 4 games, Coach O should be given strong consideration for the full time job as head coach. Only if the university were to get Pete Carroll to return or possibly a Nick Saban to coach here, would most other potential candidates be less than what the Alums would want. Coach O is part of this family, the Trojan family. He loves being her and he is honored to be even the interim head coach. the players love playing for coach O. They love his style and it is reflected in these games that we have played so far.

The USC men’s basketball team, led by former Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield, will look to improve both the results on the court and the attendance at the Galen Center. And to propel Enfield’s fast-paced offense, which helped lead his old team to the Sweet 16, the Trojans will have to depend on strong guard play.
Last year at Florida Gulf Coast, guards Sherwood Brown and Bernard Thompson led the Eagles with 15.5 and 14.3 points per game, respectively, with Thompson also averaging 2.8 steals per game. Point guard Brett Comer set the tone as the facilitator for the offense, averaging 6.6 assists per game.
Despite most focusing on how USC will replicate Enfield’s high-flying offense, Enfield said he is paying just as much attention to the team’s defense, which will be tested in a strong Pac-12 conference that boasts three teams in the Associated Press preseason Top 25.
“My team last year was 16th in the nation in steals at nine per game, so it’s a big point of emphasis for us,” Enfield said about his defense. “Get deflections, get steals. We play in man, we play in zone, we’ll press a little bit, we’ll mix our defenses up — but we have to be ready to go. We have to execute, no question. You get in transition easiest when you steal the ball or get a long rebound. We averaged nine steals a game last year and that was [nine] chances to run.”
The guards on USC’s roster are a mix of new faces and battle-tested veterans who will need to maintain a high level of play to keep the offense firing on all cylinders.
Junior Byron Wesley serves as the most experienced member of the backcourt. He’s played more games (64) than any current Trojan, starting each except for one while averaging 33.2 minutes per game in his career. He averaged 10.2 points (third on the team) and 4.3 rebounds per game last season, along with being second on the team with 61 assists. Wesley is likely to start for the Trojans in their season opener.
Senior J.T. Terrell brings exceptional shooting ability, having averaged 11.7 points and 2.1 rebounds in 2012-13. He hit 67 three-pointers, which is the 11th-most in a single season in USC history, and shot 76.4 percent from the free-throw line, leading all USC players. And though Terrell seems likely to be out there at shooting guard for the opening tipoff, it’s unclear how Enfield will choose his starting lineup to best run his system.
“We have a lot of athletic players who can get up and down, so I think the style really complements the players that we have and the format that we like to play,” senior point guard Pe’Shon Howard said.
The Trojan backcourt will also see plenty of new members of the basketball program, with two transfers in Howard and sophomore guard Katin Reinhardt joining the roster along with three freshmen. First-year guards Kahlil Dukes, Julian Jacobs and Devon Pflueger will all look to make immediate contributions during what is being pegged by pundits as a transitional season. But if USC’s newcomers all make a big impact and come close to replicating the numbers they put up at their previous schools, it’s certainly possible the Trojans could contend for a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
Dukes averaged 23.9 points, 3.9 assists and 3.0 steals per game as a senior at Capital Prep Magnet School, and should provide Enfield with another scoring threat.
Jacobs was named Nevada’s Player of the Year by the Las Vegas Review-Journal during his senior year of high school after averaging 16.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 3.2 steals per game at Desert Pines High.
Pflueger averaged 9.5 points per game at Junipero Serra Catholic High (Gardena, Calif.), hitting 45.9 percent of his threes and 49 percent overall before suffering a season-ending ankle injury.
Howard, who is eligible to start immediately at USC after three seasons at Maryland, has 84 games (44 starts) of college experience, along with 20 games of five or more assists. He averaged 3.3 points, 2.4 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 36 games with the Terrapins, helping lead them to the NIT semifinals.
“This is a different style and a different atmosphere for everybody,” Howard said about the changes. “The coaches are really positive and upbeat. We like to play fast.”
Reinhardt, who transferred from UNLV, has to sit out this season due to NCAA transfer rules. He started 34 of UNLV’s 35 games, finishing fourth on the team with 10.1 points per game, second with 86 assists and first with 65 three-pointers made.
The Trojan backcourt is rounded out with sophomores Chass Bryan and Brendyn Taylor and redshirt senior Daniel Munoz. Bryan is fast and disruptive at both ends on the floor, serving as another strong option for coach Enfield despite his walk-on status. Taylor gives the Trojans a strong defensive presence, while Munoz gives the Trojans experience off the bench.
USC opens up the regular season on the road on Friday at 8 p.m. against Utah State. Their home opener is on Nov. 12 at 8 p.m. against Cal State Northridge.

The USC women’s soccer team is looking to replicate last year’s season finale as they finish their regular season against No. 2 UCLA on Thursday in Westwood.
Looking to the past · Senior midfielder Jordan Marada has two goals and four assists this season after leading USC last year with five goals and five assists, which included a game-winner against UCLA in the season finale. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (8-9-2, 3-6-1 Pac-12) are coming off of a sweep of conference opponents from the state of Oregon, pulling out a 2-1 overtime win on Friday over the Ducks (4-11-3, 2-7-1 Pac-12) and a 2-1 double overtime win on Sunday over the Beavers (5-12-2, 3-6-1 Pac-12) on Senior Day.
After Oregon’s Kristen Parr scored just over four minutes into the game, sophomore forward Katie Johnson knocked the equalizer in in the 80th minute to send the game into overtime. Freshman midfielder Kayla Mills would score the game-winner against Oregon to end a three-game losing streak for USC. After Oregon State’s Jenna Richardson opened with a goal 46 seconds into Sunday’s contest, senior forward Elizabeth Eddy used a penalty kick in the 10th minute to tie the game at 1. The game would go down to the wire, as a handball call on the Beavers in the final minute led to the game-winning penalty kick from sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink.
“I think the weird thing about our team is that, when we get scored on, we come back crazy and ready to fight,” senior midfielder Autumn Altamirano said. “I think it was a good thing they scored early on us.”
The Women of Troy outshot their opponents 73-21 over the weekend, picking up a season-high 43 shots against the Beavers.
“Our team has been peaking, and we always seem to peak near the end of the year, so hopefully we’ll maybe get the chance to play further on,” Eddy said. “Our team is just kind of coming together and playing for each other.”
Mills enters the finale as USC’s points leader with 15 (4 goals, 7 assists). Eddy leads the team in goals (six), followed by Johnson (five).
UCLA (16-1-2, 8-0-2 Pac-12) continued their perfect conference run with a 3-0 win over Oregon State on Friday and a 2-0 win over Oregon on Sunday. Their win over the Ducks clinched their 11th Pac-12 championship and first since 2008.
Darian Jenkins leads the Bruins with 24 points (10 goals, 4 assists), while Taylor Smith and Sarah Killion are tied for the team lead in assists with eight each. Goalkeeper Katelyn Rowland has 10 shutouts and a 0.32 goals against average on the season.
“We’ve got more than 72 hours to recover, so we should be fine,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said, brushing off any fears about the possibility of the two overtime contests affecting their performance Thursday.
The Bruins are outscoring their opponents 36-6 on the season, while the Women of Troy have outscored their opponents 30-23.
Due to the squad’s lengthy losing streak at the beginning of conference play, it’s extremely doubtful that the Women of Troy will qualify for postseason play.
But USC hopes to repeat the result from last year’s match against UCLA, when they also beat a No. 2-ranked Bruins squad 3-2 in their last game to end the season on a high note.
Senior midfielder Jordan Marada scored the game-winning goal at the end of the first overtime in USC’s ninth overtime game of the 2012 season.
The Women of Troy are 5-20-1 all-time against UCLA, and are 3-5 against the Bruins under Khosroshahin.
“UCLA’s always a fun match, and we always get pumped up for them,” Altamirano said.
The teams kick off in Westwood at 5 p.m.

Heopfully this coach will be fired at the end of this season regardless if they beat UCLA or not.  He is a disaster.

On Wednesday, the Political Student Assembly held a debate at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on oil drilling activities near USC.
Heated debate · Ivan Kumamoto, of the Environmental Affairs Organization, and community organizer Alexandra Nagy discuss fracking. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
A panel of students and community members divided into two groups — one “for” and one “against” the drilling activities and related operations such as hydraulic fracturing — and argued the fiscal benefits and detriments, environmental implications, political implications and health impacts involved with the activities.
Representing the “for” side was Giuseppe Robalino and Jennifer Massey of the USC College Republicans, and Mohammad Javaheri, a Ph.D. student in petroleum engineering and member of the USC Society of Petroleum Engineers. Representing the “against” side were Monica Uriarte and Nalleli Cobo, two residents who live near one of the oil drilling sites, Alexandra Nagy, a community organizer with Food & Water Watch and Ivan Kumamoto, a member of USC’s Environmental Affairs Organization.
The operations that sparked the debate were the Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas Company site on Jefferson Boulevard and the Allenco Energy, Inc. site located on West 23rd Street.
As one of the environmental issues getting major coverage in the media, hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” dominated the debate. This practice involves the high-pressure injection of fluid into an oil or gas reservoir to allow for better recovery of the resource being extracted.
Regarding this practice, Robalino and Massey argued that there is a lot of misinformation and scare tactics clouding the argument. The panelists said that a debate should be centered on the facts, not emotion. Javaheri cited the benefits of fracking, highlighting that it reduced the United States’ dependence on coal as an energy source.
“Renewables cannot replace natural gas,” Javaheri said.
Alternatively, Uriarte and Cobo cited the oil and gas energy industry’s political power and argued that there were externalized costs that oil industry proponents were not taking into account such as environmental and public health impacts.
Kumamoto highlighted the difference between drilling where nobody lives and drilling where there are a lot of residents. Uriarte showed the audience Styrofoam heads marked to show ailments that residents in her community have been experiencing.
“I’m not getting emotional, I’m getting real,” she said.
As the debate progressed, the sides went back and forth disputing studies regarding the economic impacts and public health impacts of fracking. Whether or not fracking was actually occurring on Jefferson Boulevard, however, was not directly addressed.
During the Q&A portion of the event, Bilal Hakim, a graduate student studying petroleum engineering and the event coordinator for the USC Society of Petroleum Engineers relayed information obtained from Freeport-McMoRan that no fracking was actually occurring or will be occurring at the Jefferson site.
“We have been coexisting with oil wells. Just because people made two or three documentaries and raised a media hype, all of a sudden you’re asking the question: ‘What would you do if you have to live with these things?’ We have been living with these things. People just don’t know about it,” Hakim said. “We have been coexisting with oil wells in our backyard, you just have to look for it.”
Alina Evans, a first-year graduate student in public diplomacy, previously lived adjacent to the Jefferson site and wrote an Oct. 8, 2013 opinion article for Neon Tommy on the subject. Evans said that she has not experienced any health effects from the two months that she lived near the site. She moved from the building because of the activity.
“It smells like the La Brea Tar Pits. It is lit up like a space station at night, so I had to buy blackout curtains for my windows,” Evans said.

For the final “Students Talk Back,” forum of the semester, hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Schwarzenegger Institute, panelists discussed the United States’ policy toward the Middle East.
International relations · Peter Baker, White House correspondent for The New York Times, discusses his views on U.S. foreign policy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The panelists included Peter Baker, White House correspondent for The New York Times and author of Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House; Terry McCarthy, president and CEO of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and Annalise Mantz, editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan. Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Yasmeen Serhan, co-online editor of the Daily Trojan served as moderators of the event.
Baker, Mantz and McCarthy analyzed the situation from different angles: Baker from the point of view of the Bush’s relationship with Cheney, Mantz from public opinion and polling and McCarthy from a political theory perspective. All three panelists agreed, however, that the United States is tired of war in the Middle East.
Mantz cited a CNN poll in which seven in 10 Americans said they believed that a strike in Syria would not advance U.S. goals. Another poll reported that 53 percent of Americans are opposed to the Iraq War.
Baker argued that though these negative opinions toward military involvement have had a large effect on Obama’s presence in Syria, public opinion in fact had a different impact on the Bush-Cheney intervention into Iraq, turning the war in to one of principle rather than one of politics.
“He looked at the low [polling] numbers he had as a badge of honor,” Baker said.
McCarthy approached many of his arguments from a theoretical perspective.
“The bigger problem we have is: What is America’s role in the Middle East and how unilateral can it be?” McCarthy asked.
McCarthy said Putin’s role in the Syria conflict helped to end unilateral intervention into the Middle East.
McCarthy also argued for the need for self-determination, wherever that might lead, for the Middle East despite the fact that he believes that this path will be a destructive one.
“It’s unclear to me whether Syria even remains a country,” he said.
Citing its history and its shift from power in dictatorship to power in the people, McCarthy pointed out that Syria is an artificial country designed by the French, and that conflict there was inevitable.
Though the discussion principally remained on the topic of the Middle East, Baker discussed his book, which discusses the entire Bush administration, not just Iraq. He cited differences in leadership styles with an anecdote concerning Bush, and one concerning Obama. When both of them dealt with leaks in their administrations, Obama said he was disappointed, but Bush threatened to fire potential leakers.
“It’s the mom approach and the dad approach,” Baker said, pointing out that neither method is right or wrong. “Mom is disappointed. Dad is just going to fire your a–. It is a different approach and it’s tough love in two different ways.”
When the forum opened up to the audience for questions, Denise Ge, a senior majoring in international relations (global business) asked McCarthy about unilateralism in Middle Eastern public policy. Though McCarthy said he believes that intervention will be multilateral and done through the United Nations, he also believes that an attempted military strike will be done unilaterally.
When interviewed after the discussion, Ge expressed support for the forum.
“[The forum] kind of cast a different light on the story that we read every day,” Ge said. “Students are often very unaware of what is happening in the world.”
On the other hand, Ge had hoped there would be more discussion about the humanitarian implications of the Arab Spring.
Other students said they were more concerned with the relationship between Bush and Cheney that was explored during the event. According to the event’s speakers, the initial push for war came from Cheney but the second term found Bush relying more on his other advisers.
“It was interesting to see how Bush changed from first term to second term and how his disconnect [with Cheney] expanded and grew,” said Chris Lee, a senior majoring in international relations and economics.
Whitney Davis, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, also enjoyed learning more about the former president.
“I really enjoyed Peter [Baker’s] background knowledge of the Bush and Cheney relationship. That was something I was not aware of growing up during that time.”

Coming straight from a visit at the Boys and Girls Club in Hollywood, Teddy Davis attended a dinner at a Downtown L.A. hotel for the Miguel Contreras Foundation on Oct. 29. It’s a packed schedule that Davis, a former journalist and communications strategist, and current fellow at USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, is becoming more accustomed to as he campaigns for Los Angeles City Council.
Two months ago, Davis entered the City Council race for a vacant seat in District 4. Even though the election isn’t until 2015, campaigning within the community has already begun, as evidenced by the stream of photo ops on Davis’ Twitter account.
Davis — who is running on a platform that includes creating jobs, reducing traffic and keeping neighborhoods clean and safe — believes that this busy schedule in the community is just part of the job.
“A councilmember always has to be out in the neighborhoods, listening to people,” Davis said. “You can be their voice.”
Davis was born in Los Feliz and went to school in Sherman Oaks — both areas of Los Angeles within District 4 — before attending Georgetown University. Since then, he has held a variety of different positions in politics and communications, including covering politics for ABC News, working nationally and locally for the labor union Service Employees International Union and holding key positions in the administrations of former California Gov. Gray Davis and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.
Most recently, Davis served as press secretary for Villaraigosa and, earlier this year, as director of strategic communications for Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland.
Davis attributed his interest in politics to a 1992 rally he attended for then-governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton.
“It changed the way I looked at politics. It stopped being something that other people do and it seemed like something that was very open and that all of us have a chance to get involved [in],” Davis said.
Davis’ current fellowship at USC involves lending his expertise to discussions on current issues and policy, as well as mentoring students who are interested in politics.
“My favorite part is having the chance to hear about a student who wants to go into politics, who wants to work in public service, who is curious about ‘What is this job like?’ ‘How do you get that kind of job?’ ‘What paths do people take?’ and be able to share [my] experience,” Davis said. “If I can help anyone achieve their goals of being in politics or making a positive difference in public service, that’s the greatest benefit for me.”
Davis recently did a Question & Answer session with the USC College Democrats where he answered questions about politics and public service.
“We try to bring in leaders or people that want to be leaders in the community, and that have that experience,” said James Drevno, a sophomore majoring in policy, planning and development. “I thought it was really good.”
Other students said they were inspired by Davis’ story.
“It’s nice to see someone who’s been able to bounce back and forth,” said Catherine Shieh, president of the USC College Democrats. “Not having that fear to take a risk is always a great message for college students to learn.”
Davis said that taking advantage of internships is the best way for students interested in public service to become involved in politics.
“It is very hard to get hired into a job if you don’t already know the people,” Davis said. “People who do hiring like to hire people that they know, and if they feel like they met you during the internship, you are much more likely to get hired than if you come to them just cold from the outside.”

Recruiting has started for S.A.F.E. T-Alliance, a campus-wide program set to launch next spring by the USC Center for Women and Men, which aims to make the USC campus and community safer through awareness of gender-based violence.
The program will also provide aid and support to members of the USC community who have been victims of gender-based violence, such as stalking, dating violence, sexual assault and sexual harassment.
“The hope … is to feel safe and connected to each other, to feel responsible to ensure one another’s safety. It creates more cohesion. We are already a Trojan Family, this is just another way to enhance that and to support someone, should something happen,” said La Shonda Coleman, the director of S.A.F.E. T-Alliance.
In addition, the S.A.F.E. T-Alliance will launch a leadership program for students, aimed to facilitate peer education. Thus far, there are two types of positions a student can apply for: a tier one safety liaison or a tier two safety leader.
“A safety liaison has a basic knowledge of issues, campus issues and resources,” Coleman said. “They represent a group or organization on campus and keep us connected and establish a relationship with that group.”
Liaisons will receive training through multiple external organizations, such as Peace Over Violence and the Rape Treatment Center, to learn how to deal with issues of common gender violence. The students will also be familiarized with the local resources such as the Dept. of Public Safety’s procedures.
“We understand the importance of outside agencies and how their input is valuable. It is truly collaborative — that is the best way to describe it; it is a collaborative initiative,” Coleman said.
Safety leaders take on higher leadership responsibilities within the alliance. This position requires more than the basic training because safety leaders will work hand-in-hand with staff members, help facilitate workshops and provide support to survivors of gender-based violence.
Coleman said she wants the organization to focus heavily on peer-to-peer contact because she believes that it is essential for students to show their support and be a part of the solution to gender-based violence.
“Why not equip students to be a resource to their peers?” Coleman said. “There is such an opportunity for peer-to-peer education. Peers are more likely to reach out to other peers.”
Coleman said that the recent rape cases that have surfaced at USC just further illustrate how more needs to be done at USC to shift the way students think about sexual harassment.
“It’s not OK. That is why we need a program like this to change the culture. I don’t think girls understand what sexual harassment is, some think it is normal and they shouldn’t take that lightly,” said Kelly Kinas, a freshman majoring in theatre.
Coleman said that she hopes that students leaders from different cross sections within the campus will help to break this pattern of thinking.
“We are looking for someone who is genuinely interested and committed to ensure campus safety and provide support in our community,” Coleman said.
Kinas said she has already submitted her application to S.A.F.E. T-Alliance. Kinas learned about the program after she heard Coleman speak during one of her sorority’s Monday night dinners and applied because she feels personally invested in Coleman’s cause.
“One of my theatre girls got raped outside in a car — it’s absolutely terrible,” Kinas said. “I want to help in any way that I can.”
Other students have expressed support for the program because they believe a program with trained peers might help more people speak up about gender-based violence.
“I would feel a lot safer on campus if this program is implemented … to have students have someone to come to if they aren’t comfortable in talking to their family or friends. It’s nice to have a place to help,” Adanna Teemac, a freshman majoring in psychology, said.
Though the program is just getting started, Coleman said that as it continues to grow, it will continue to shift to adapt to the needs of the university.
“We want to do our best to be a reflection of the USC community and their needs,” Coleman said.

According to the Dept. of Public Safety, a 2008 Honda Civic collided with a 20-year-old male USC student on a bicycle around 10:40 p.m. Tuesday evening and subsequently fled the scene. A security ambassador reported the traffic collision happened at the intersection of 28th Street and Figueroa Street.
“The student was treated at the scene by paramedics and then transferred to California Hospital where he was later released,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said.
According to ABC News, the student suffered scratches and was treated for hip and shoulder pain.
“He complained of pain in his left hip and shoulder and had abrasions on his wrist and knee,” said Sgt. A. Cruz of Los Angeles Police Department South Traffic Division.
Though DPS was on the scene, LAPD South Traffic Division is handling the investigation.

If you’re coming back early from The Weekender (or if you’re just not going), Fool’s Gold is hosting “Day Off,” an annual party right next to campus in the Shrine Auditorium. Free RSVP admissions are closed, but $55 VIP tickets are still on sale. VIP ticketholders get line-free admission and a special viewing area where they’ll be able to take in Fool’s Gold headliners A-Trak and Danny Brown. Anyone who was at Springfest last semester can tell you that A-Trak can put together a killer set, and up-and-coming Detroit rapper Danny Brown will spit some hilariously unprintable lyrics in what promises to be one of the true highlights of the fall semester.
 
Japanese Food Festival
Nov. 10, 11 a.m. – 3 p.m.
Hilton Los Angeles

Tickets are a little steep at $60 each but admission includes all-you-can-eat sushi, ramen, soba noodles and beef bowls. In what could be a potential recipe for disaster, all-you-can-drink Japanese beer and sake are also included in the price of admission. If all-you-can-eat sushi from Sushi Gen doesn’t get you excited enough, there will be musical performances including taiko drum demonstrations and live jazz music. If you’re still not convinced, just take comfort in the fact that you’ll be partaking in one of the most generically named festivals in Los Angeles this weekend.

There have been a few pieces of recent news that made me feel, once again, that perhaps I’m not the only one with a turbulent relationship to changing communication technologies.
Last week, on Oct. 28, the Syrian Electronic Army struck again. The group of hackers supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime took credit for redirecting links from President Barack Obama’s campaign social media to propaganda videos for the group. Though the digital “army” did not gain direct access to Obama’s Facebook or Twitter accounts, it did hack the link shortener used by the campaign.
On Tuesday, there were reports suggesting that FoxNews.com had been hacked after the front page included a headline that read “WEEEEEEEEEEEEE” and a deck underneath that said, “Stuff yo.” It turns out that “during routine website maintenance, a home page prototype was accidentally moved to the actual site,”  Fox News Chief Digital Officer Jeff Misenti said in a statement to the Huffington Post. A hacking it was not. But the experience is still indicative of how the Internet can be a place where what we intend is not always what is displayed.
OK, in all honesty, neither of these news pieces were so revolutionary. It’s something we’ve been seeing for quite some time. But if Obama’s social media can get hacked, then I’ll feel slightly less bad next time you get that direct message from me with a sketchy link asking you to check out what people are saying about you online.
If you’ve read my column in the past, you’ll know that my fears range from being turned into a viral meme to having some minor difficulties controlling my phone. And so, as you can imagine, there are very few things that give me more unease than the hacker.
Luckily, I don’t have too much experience with being hacked, minus the occasional friend-changes-Facebook-status-when-you’re-not-looking situation.
Well, there was this one time freshman year. I was minding my own business (actually pledging a fraternity) when I got a frantic call from none other than my very own mom.
“Daniel, did you see the email you just sent out?”
The answer was a resounding and obvious no. Of course, there was nothing I could do about it. I was only a pledge and couldn’t leave just because my AOL (yes, I still have one) account had been hacked.
When I did see the email, however, I must admit I understood why my mom had been so panicky. The email, which had something to do with muscle-building supplements (I think) had gone out to everyone I’d ever emailed, from former bosses to family to robotic “reply@” addresses. Whoops.
I had become the worst thing imaginable: a spammer.
As time went by, though, this fear went from reality to something barely considered in the back of my mind. That is, until the same thing happened with my Gmail account over the summer. Now the fear is back and in full force.
Trivial spam aside, hacking is a serious issue and one that’s only likely to grow in seriousness, as digital technology becomes more integrated with daily aspects of life. Already, we’re seeing hacking to gain information, not only about individuals, but also about different governments and their programs.
Back in May, for example, the Washington Post reported that “designs for many of the nation’s most sensitive advanced weapons systems have been compromised by Chinese hackers, according to a report prepared for the Pentagon and to officials from government and the defense industry.
And that’s only one example of an aspect of civic life increasingly open to hacks.
Other aspects of life, as they become more reliant on digital technology, are becoming evermore exposed to hackers. This includes records kept by insurance companies, doctor’s offices, banks, etc…
And, of course, there’s the National Security Administration (but I’ll have to leave that for another column).
It’s because of reaction to news of frequent hacks that my mom refuses to hand out any personal information without a hard-fought (and often lengthy) battle.
But I get it. It is scary to know that private, personal information is so close to the fingertips of others. It’s perhaps even more worrisome to realize that systems you might believe more secure, such as an email account, can so easily be compromised.
Sure it’s a relatively minor, albeit embarrassing, issue to have your email compromised so that it sends a muscle-building supplement ad to all of your contacts. For the most part, people know what’s spam and what’s not.
But what if it was worse?
In a world more prone to hacks, everyone ranging from individuals to large companies has a responsibility to understand hackers, their modes of entry, and to defend themselves accordingly. When it comes to this 21st Century Fear, it’s likely we’ve only seen the beginning.

It’s interesting that those who claim to be members of the “tech community” or those in the IT field seem to be hacked the most.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently awarded USC alumnus Barbara Stepansky with one of its highest honors in screenwriting. The Academy selects five screenplays and gives a cash prize of $35,000 to the writers. This year, 7,251 screenplays were submitted to the competition. Stepansky earned this high honor for her screenplay Sugar in My Veins.
Humble beginnings · Stepansky was a philosophy of science major at University College London where she worked with director Christopher Nolan on the latter’s first film, Following. Stepansky would soon follow by directing her first film, the 2009 horror film Hurt starring Sofia Vassilieva. – Photo courtesy of Barbara Stepansky
Sugar in My Veins follows a 14-year-old violin prodigy as she falls in love with her sister’s boyfriend, a man twice her age.
“It follows the troubling affair and how it changes her and the people around her,” Stepansky said.
The Academy is celebrating the achievements of the six selected screenwriters with a public reading from a portion of their scripts at the Academy headquarters in Beverly Hills Thursday night. Stepansky will receive her award and is expected to give a speech.
Stepansky was born in Poland and later moved to Germany.
“I lived in a sleepy town where nothing happens,” Stepansky said.
At a young age, Stepansky was extremely motivated or what she describes as an “overachieving teenager.” Between playing two instruments, dancing ballet, heading both the drama and photography societies at her school and writing novels, she found filmmaking to be the perfect combination of all her talents and interests.
Stepansky was 16 years old when she realized that filmmaking was an actual option for a profession. After playing around with cameras with her friends, she developed a fascination with the behind-the-scenes work of film.
“I always loved movies, but I wanted to know how they worked,” Stepansky said.
After graduating from high school in Germany, she began her studies at University College London where she sought to “explore the world.”
Though her passion lied in filmmaking, Stepansky majored in philosophy of science. Coming from a sheltered existence in a quiet German town, she felt she needed to live a little before going into film.
“I feel like film is about people sharing something about life and society,” Stepansky said. “I didn’t have anything to say.”
During her studies at UCL, she learned to be analytical and confident and accumulated real-life experiences.
“I wanted to, get drunk, have freedom and make mistakes,” Stepansky said.
At UCL, Stepansky worked with director Christopher Nolan on his first film, Following. The future director of The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception rented equipment from the UCL Film Society, which Stepansky was the president of at the time. She remembers being blown away by his talent.
“That man is a flawless filmmaker,” she said.
By obtaining an MFA in film and TV production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts’ graduate program, Stepansky was able to get a solid foundation of all aspects of filmmaking.
“As a director, you need to be a jack of all trades. You need to be able to talk to your photography director without sounding like an idiot,” she said.
If the three-year graduate program gave her a breadth of film knowledge, it was at the American Film Institute where she could focus on the style that suited her best. The two-year film conservatory requires students to specialize in one area of filmmaking.
During her time studying the craft of directing, Stepansky developed her style which she describes as “heavily story-driven, dramatic and not flashy.” Her skills suited her work for the thriller and romance genres.
During this time, Stepansky worked as a script reader for various production companies, sifting through screenplays to find the best among them. Seeing the screenwriting process from the other side gave her a better understanding of how screenplays become successful.
“The first 10 pages are so important,” Stepansky said. “You have to grab people’s attention early if you want to be successful.”
Stepansky was able to apply her skills from USC and AFI to fulfill her dream of being a director. Doing primarily “work for hire” jobs, she directed small films written by other screenwriters, making films such as Hurt and Final Recourse. Ultimately, however, Stepansky hopes to be able to direct her own screenplay.
This may be a greater possibility as a result of the Nicholl Fellowship. Stepanksy describes this high honor as the “pinnacle for every up-and-coming writer.” This award comes just two years after she wrote the script as a part of a UCLA master class in screenwriting. It was the third time she had submitted a screenplay to the fellowship.
With the economic support from the fellowship, Stepansky is planning to focus on writing. In the course of the next year, she will work to produce another screenplay. She will continue to work on a few small films she is involved with now, she said that writing will remain her priority throughout the year.
With the her heightened status and new connections as a result of the fellowship, Stepansky is still set on directing, hopefully at a higher level.
“I want to move up a notch,” she said.

When considering the term “boot camp,” usually the image of a strictly disciplined, gruelingly physical military workout comes to mind. Los Angeles’ General Assembly brings a different kind of boot camp to USC and UCLA students, though: one that provides the skills necessary to begin or work at a startup company.
Halls of learning · Startup Bootcamp will take place on the GA’s Santa Monica campus and give students a forum to discuss tech startups. – Photo courtesy of General Assembly
“Basically our boot camp is designed for students who want to learn more about opportunities in technology and startups,” said Bita Shahian, a 2011 USC graduate who works for GA as a partnerships associate.
The event will bring together hundreds of students, as well as technology and startup company executives, for deep conversation and intense learning in only three hours. Shahian wants the event to help create conversation around startups and technology in ways that undergraduate majors don’t touch on.
“I hope that students come away with a sense of how to find meaningful careers for themselves, and they get excited about technology and design and all the elements we’ve made so much progress in,” Shahian said.
Founded in 2011 in New York, GA is an organization that helps Americans learn more about modern technology and techniques necessary to join higher tiers of America’s workforce.
“Our mission is to help people forge more meaningful and challenging career paths for themselves,” Shahian said.
GA works as a community to provide full-length classes in areas such as software development and design as well as more efficient ways to teach technical skills to those without graduate school background.
Its classes are focused specifically on people who have not received higher education degrees but hope to challenge themselves by entering higher-level jobs in technical fields.
Startup Bootcamp, the brainchild of Shahian, is GA’s way of reaching out to college students. The boot camp is tailored to students interested in technology and will focus on the development and marketing aspects of beginning or working for a technology-based startup.
“For a startup, [entrepreneurs] basically need five things; somebody to help with marketing and development, somebody to manage projects, someone to do web development, someone to design the actual product and someone to work with software,” Shahian said.
Shahian said she wanted to create a program that would be useful for college students as well as encourage students who live in Los Angeles to stay in the area and bring their technological skills here rather than going directly to the Bay Area.
“[Our goal is] to help students who are interested in entrepreneurship to break into startups with unique opportunities and training,” Shahian said.
Sasha Spala, an executive board member of USC’s Girls in Tech club, said that this is a unique opportunity for the girls in her organization as well as others interested in technology and startups.
“We really want to get girls and their friends involved,” Spala said.
Because the boot camp will bring students from USC and UCLA together in a way that connects their passions and interests, Spala also sees it as a good networking opportunity.
“I think it’s really cool that we have an opportunity to connect with students from our rival school who we otherwise never would [connect with],” Spala said.
The free, three-hour event will take place on Saturday at the GA’s headquarters in Santa Monica. It is open to undergraduate students from USC and UCLA, who can sign up by going to startupbootcamp1.eventbrite.com.

Sixty-one Republicans and Democrats in the Senate joined forces earlier this week to move forward on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination in the workplace based on sexual and gender orientation. The bill is expected to pass in the Senate by the week’s end, when it will go to the House of Representatives.
Once again, House Republicans under Speaker John Boehner are seeking to prove that their colleagues in the Senate are too rational for the rest of the GOP, whether those Senate Republicans like it or not. Those Senators, who include Dean Heller (R-Nevada) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), are miles ahead of the rest of their party, which becomes more divided with each issue that Congress tackles.
Tammy Do | Daily Trojan
 
ENDA is not expected to see the light of day in the House. At best, the GOP opposition to the bill is grounded in both a skewed understanding of religious freedom and blind faith to “small businesses.” At worst, the House GOP is demonstrating blatant moral bankruptcy and proving that they will align themselves against people of different sexual and gender orientation at all costs.
State regulations already attempt to limit discrimination, but they are not nearly as comprehensive as federal laws. As long as federal law does not protect qualified Americans from being fired or not considered for jobs based on their identity, then it falls short of the ideals that the United States was founded upon. Apparently, so does the dominant ideology in the House of Representatives.
In a statement released to the public by Boehner spokesman Michael Steel, the Speaker voiced his opposition to anti-discrimination legislation. His reason?
“The speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small-business jobs.”
Beyond the absurdity of the factual claim, Boehner’s moral hierarchy is frightening. The last time I checked, the United States of America does not put the interests of small businesses above equality.
In addition, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, a law that prohibited children from working in sweatshops, was also “costly” for small businesses. So were subsequent minimum wage laws that prohibited companies from paying workers ten cents an hour for backbreaking labor, like they do in China. Not convinced yet? Compare Speaker Boehner’s opposition to ENDA to this excerpt from another Congressional speech:
“By its attempt to regulate and govern the private businesses, which are miscalled public accommodations in the bill, this proposal would inject the Government into the most sensitive areas of human contractual relations — agreements for personal services.”
Sound familiar? It should. Both statements voice fundamental opposition to anti-discrimination legislation on the basis of economic priority and the ability of businesses to operate efficiently. The difference? The above quote is 49 years old. It’s an excerpt from a speech given by Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, in opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
And if you still aren’t convinced, let’s rewind another 100 years. How many plantation owners thought that the Emancipation Proclamation impeded their ability to run a cost-efficient “small business?”
The sad thing is, some members of the GOP drop the “small business” excuse every day. We can find it in nearly every speech in opposition to bills ranging from the Affordable Care Act to clean air regulations, and voters let them get away with it. Allowing economics to drive morality is a dangerous game, and the next defense of the law, “religious freedom,” potentially is even worse.
Before voicing support for the bill, Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey and Rob Portman met secretly and garnered their support for the bill on including exemptions for religious groups.
The right to the free exercise of religion protected by the Bill of Rights should never be used to defend the “right” of employers to discriminate based on sexual orientation. Such logic deems that religious groups should be given an “exception” to discriminate against homosexuals, and while it may have been socially acceptable 20 years ago, it certainly is not now.
The First Amendment also prohibits Congress from respecting an establishment of religion, inspired in part by colonial Maryland where the colonial government actively persecuted Quakers (and all other dissenters). Freedom of religion is intrinsically related to freedom from discrimination, and any religious group that seeks an “exception” to anti-discrimination legislation is forgetting that freedom of religion was established to protect them from discrimination in the first place.
The seven GOP Senators and handful of GOP representation willing to support ENDA should be commended, but it is downright reprehensible that the most significant equality measure since the repeal of “don’t-ask-don’t-tell” is expected to fail in the House of Representatives.
The last time I checked, the United States was better than this.

Don’t all anti-discrimination “laws” violate the principle of free association? Why should only special people in Washington DC decide for the rest of us whom we may hire or what criteria we may use?

Last Monday, former Arizona congressman Rick Renzi was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted in June for federal corruption charges.
The charges follow Renzi’s conviction on charges of extortion, bribery, insurance fraud, money laundering and racketeering related to a 2005 money laundering scheme that cost the Republican more than $700,000 in charges. But this situation is not unique to the Republican party — in fact, corruption runs rampant within the United States’ entire political system and it is absolutely imperative that citizens demand an end to the dishonesty.
Renzi’s lawyers hoped to prevent the ex-congressman’s prosecution on the grounds that it would violate the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause, a privilege reserved for lawmakers that protects them and their staff from legal action over “legislative” acts. Evidence that surfaced during the 24-day trial found that Renzi promised to use his legislative influence as a representative of Arizona’s 1st Congressional District to profit from a federal land exchange. Renzi was also accused of misappropriating money from his family insurance business to fund his campaigns and for personal benefit. Clauses such as this one help congressmen forge excuses for their lies.
The clause states that members of both Houses of Congress “shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.”
But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel deemed this clause does not exempt congressmen from their responsibility.
Following Renzi’s fiasco, Melvin E. Lowe, the former political aide to John Sampson, a former Democratic leader in the state Senate, was arrested on federal corruption charges last Tuesday, according to The New York Times.
It is an unfortunate fact that political corruption has become not only relatively common but also expected. It seems that it might take a supercitizen to resist the temptations that are part of the legislative job.
Legislators cannot continue to vote down the tightening of finance rules — it is these rules that discourage corruption.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court’s case last year of Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission cleared the way for corporations to make unlimited donations, which has given them a tremendous role in the decisions of U.S. legislators. This corruption crosses an ethical line. It goes beyond skewed voting and large party donations. It can lead politicians in office to steer away from their foremost priority of the public’s interest. Instead, this causes public interest to come second and decisions to revolve around benefitting those who fund them, often including themselves as the Renzi and Lowe cases show.
And though some corruption is inevitable in any political system, there is no excuse for lawmakers to justify this behavior by exhibiting lenience in handling these cases. When greediness starts to control the moral compasses of our political representatives, there is an obvious problem. Detailed laws need to be created and enforced to prevent these corrupt representatives from being able to hire lawyers to find loopholes that allow representatives to walk away without consequence.
The only way to end this political corruption is to hold politicians accountable for their actions. Greater regulations need to be put in place to force representatives to act openly. Only when this happens can trust be restored between the public and the government. Transparency in government actions also allows the public to make informed voting decisions and to hold officials accountable once elected.
One way that the United States can currently minimize corruption is the Secrecy Report. This annual report analyzes the freedom of information in the United States based on new legislations and infrastructures that allow for measuring progress or stagnation.
If this method were applied across the board to include a broader number of government officials, such as state representatives, this could be a step in the right direction. Doing so would increase trust and promote a positive relationship between government and the American people.
The regularity and acceptance of political corruption in the United States is incredibly ironic for a country that prides itself on fairness and freedom. The U.S. political system cannot continue to serve as a role model without fixing this increasingly apparent fracture in its foundation.
