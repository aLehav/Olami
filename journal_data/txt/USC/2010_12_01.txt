As you may or may not know, this is the last Daily Trojan issue of the semester. It’s been a wild, crazy, bacon-wrapped-hot-dog-filled ride, but all good things must come to an end (right Pete Carroll?).
With that in mind, this is the last chance to print something about the current football season.
It seems like forever ago that Carroll ditched USC and Lane Kiffin stepped in. Hard to believe that was just earlier this year. A lot has happened since then. The Trojans had more issues — mostly off the field — than Conan O’Brien’s hair stylist.
There was the abrupt coaching change, the new athletic director, the NCAA sanctions and scholarship reductions, the Reggie Bush Heisman saga, the golf cart rides and the injuries. More has happened to the USC football program in 12 months than most program’s experience in a generation (or five if you’re Penn State).
On the field, it hasn’t always been pretty either. There were the tackling woes, the Katy Perry-like hot-and-cold running game and the general inability to perform in the clutch. There were some great wins, especially against a ranked Arizona team on the road and the blowout of Cal, but those were overshadowed by the tough, rip-your-heart-out-and-put-it-through-a-pencil-sharpener losses against Washington, Stanford and Notre Dame.
However, I wouldn’t go so far as to call this season a disappointment. Yes, USC is 7-5 and just lost to Notre Dame. Other than the two blowout losses to the Oregon schools, the Trojans could easily be 10-2 if they could only get stops in the last two minutes of the game. Part of that is inexperience, part of that is fatigue from lack of able players and part of it is just poor execution.
Considering this, and since Los Angeles seems to have decided without anyone’s permission that it is going to be cold this Christmas, there seems to be no better way to recap the last 12 months than in a song to the tune of “Jingle Bells.”
Dashing through the air, in a sweet GulfStream IV sleigh,
Pete flees to Seattle, he’s never coming back our way.
USC panics, no Santa to deliver wins this year,
Coming to save the day, Lane and his hot wife appear. 
Oh!
USC, USC,
Matt Barkley is great.
The Trojans started off well but hit a spell where they gave up field goals late.
Oh!
USC, USC,
The Coliseum was magic.
Until this year when Locker was here but the Oregon game was just tragic.
Summer finally came, and with it the sanctions
That banned USC from a bowl game and took Reggie Bush’s relations.
Nikias became president; Pat Haden is rad.
He replaced Mike Garrett and nobody was mad.
Oh!
USC, USC
The sanctions hit you hard.
You had a secondary that was greener than Cheech and Chong’s backyard.
Oh!
USC, USC,
A lot with you has changed.
If you want a golf cart ride, that Dillon Baxter can arrange.
 
Despite what its record shows, USC was good.
The Trojans were competitive, but win, Oregon State would.
They didn’t dare venture there, for they knew what was in store.
Just like at Stanford, the Beavers rushed the field when they beat us for loss number four.
 
Oh!
USC, USC
Arrogance is here.
Arrogant Nation swept the school for an undefeated year.
Oh!
USC, USC
Your season ends on Saturday.
Don’t forget to wipe the ball on U-C-L-A.

The USC swim and dive team is in Columbus, Ohio this weekend to participate in the AT&T Short Course National Championships. The championships, which take place from Dec. 2-4, are being hosted by Ohio State University at Bill and Mae McCorkle Aquatics Pavilion.
Both swim teams (men and women) are sending most of their swimmers to participate on behalf of USC — the USA National Championships are open to all swimmers who meet national time standards, meaning all but a small fraction of the team went to compete.
The team has been preparing for Nationals for quite some time, and now that they have arrived, anticipation is high.
“This meet is important, in that if we can secure top 20 times individually [top-10 relay times] then we can focus our attention this coming semester on the NCAA championships [in March],” USC head coach Dave Salo said.
After the Women of Troy swept Arizona and Arizona State three weeks ago, and the Trojans defeated Arizona State as well, the team set its sights on Nationals. Salo expressed the importance of the National Championships and the implications of the results for the team.
“Our goal for this competition is to come away with relays ranked in the top four in the country while individually we want to secure athletes in the top-20 spots leading into the conference championships in February,” Salo said.
Since they have had three weeks to rest since their last meets, the teams expect to perform even better at Nationals.
“I think the team will do really well, we rested a little but not all the way, so some people will be really fast and the others will have to race a little harder to make it back for finals,” senior women’s captain Presley Bard said. “Overall we should do really well as a team and even win a few relays. Our goal is to get as many A and B cuts possible.”
The biggest competition that the Trojans will face, according to coach Salo, will come from Michigan, California, Ohio State and the University of Minnesota. There will also be several USA National Team members that will be competing.
The National Championships are a short course yards meet that will set the tone for the rest of the season and the Trojans hope to use it as an indicator of how they will do at the rest of their meets.
“This meet is really a gauge to see where we are at and a stepping stone to the rest of the season,” Bard said.
After this meet concludes, the team’s main focus will be on the NCAA Championships. Salo is hopeful that the rest of the season will be as successful as its beginning.
“Our women’s team is shaping up to be one of the top five teams in the country based on our results thus far,” Salo said. “I think [the men’s swimmers] can position themselves to be a top eight team this year.”

“Who are you?”
The question was made famous in the chorus of The Who’s 1978 hit.
For the USC men’s basketball team (4-4, 0-0), Sunday night’s daunting test at the Galen Center against Rick Barnes and the No. 20 Texas Longhorns (6-1, 0-0) will go a long way toward answering that age-old question as the team finishes out the latter part of its nonconference schedule.
Trapped · Junior forward Nikola Vucevic and the Trojans have encountered problems recently. Vucevic missed two free throws in the final seconds in the 64-63 loss to Bradley two weeks ago and USC has lost two in a row. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Through eight games, the Trojans’ only constant has been, in fact their inconsistent play.
From late-game fouls, to second-half collapses, to the home court drubbing it received at the hands of Rider, USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s squad enters its stiffest challenge to date.
“The only long-term goal I have for this team is that we continue to get better every day,” O’Neill said. “The wins and losses will take care of themselves as we move forward.”
But if the team is to notch one in the win column against its upcoming Big 12 foe, it will take  much more than a little optimism to get the job done.
The Longhorns come to town sporting an array of talented weapons, which more or less starts with the man holding the clipboard, Barnes.
Since coming to Texas in 1997, Barnes has led the Longhorns to 12 straight NCAA tournament appearances, 11 straight 20-win seasons and holds the all-time program record for victories by a head coach with 300.
Although the team no longer has the likes of All-American Kevin Durant or All-Big 12 First Team Damion James, Barnes’ club is led by an equally gifted athlete, guard/forward Jordan Hamilton — who initially made a name for himself playing at nearby Dominguez High School in Compton, Calif.
In six games, Hamilton is averaging 22.7 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game and connecting on almost 50 percent of his 3-point field goal attempts.
The big surprise, however, for the burnt orange in the early going, has been the outstanding all-around play of forward Tristan Thompson. The Ontario, Canada, native has not been shy during his first handful of games for the Longhorns, with  12.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game.
Throw in the experience of guard Dogus Balbay and forward Gary Johnson, and USC’s final game in the 2010 Big 12/Pac-10 Hardwood Series will be far from a cake walk.
Although the Trojans’ pulse is unclear at this point ­— the team has failed to muster more than a two-game win streak — it will continue to ride the double-double capability of its big man, junior forward Nikola Vucevic, who comes into play on Sunday boasting an average of 16 points per game and 10.9 rebounds per game.
Although USC is just 1-4 over the last four years in this annual conference showdown, O’Neill and company played against the Longhorns last season — a 69-50 Texas victory in Austin, Texas — not only giving the team  added motivation but a leg up in terms of preparation as the week progresses toward Sunday’s 7:30 p.m. tip-off.
Despite the mess the team has made in recent weeks, O’Neill — who has made the tournament in his second seasons with Marquette, Northwestern and Tennessee — said he realizes that a college basketball season is not a sprint but a marathon, regardless of who is on the schedule.
“In basketball there is no crying. You have to continue play,” O’Neill said. “In our situation, the only thing we can try to do is getting better from now until the end of December.”
The main question is why were the Trojans not able to recruit Jordan Hamilton a local product.? That is where it all starts . Remember way back when Charlie Parker the head coach after George Raveling was not able to get Paul Pierce from Inglewood High to come to Troy instead going to Kansas. You see how that worked out. That is why there is no real tradition in the basketball program over the last fifty years plus.

The Women of Troy are just a day away from their opening round game in the NCAA tournament. The selection committee awarded the Women of Troy the No. 6 seed.
“I thought we were placed about right,” said USC head coach Mick Haley.
USC will face off against New Mexico on Friday at the Galen Center. If the Women of Troy win, they will host the winner of Friday’s match between Long Beach State and San Diego on Saturday.
Killer instincts · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter was one of three Trojans named to the All-Pac-10 team ahead of the NCAA tournament. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
So far this week in practice, Haley has felt his team has been a bit distracted.
“I think the intensity of the finals coming up has caused us to have a little trouble in concentrating in practice, but we’re getting through it OK,” Haley said. “I think it’s a great opportunity to learn about how to do two things at once, and try to do them well.”
Nonetheless, he still feels the team is as prepared as it can be. And the Women of Troy should have some momentum, as they closed out the season winning 11 of their final 12 matches.
“We understand what our opponents like to do and what they’ll try to do up to a point,” Haley said. “Now it’s just the preparation to see if we can defend what we think they’re going to do and then put in our game plan for how we’d like to attack them.”
Despite the team’s high seed and impressive 25-4 record this season, the Women of Troy are not taking New Mexico lightly.
“They’re a very good passing team, and that’s what gives them the opportunity to stay in games all the time. They really just stay right in there, and they hang. So if we’re going to be successful, we’re going to have to be very good at some things that we do to score points,” Haley said.
Although Haley admitted most of this week’s attention is focused on the New Mexico match, the team is preparing for a potential Saturday game as well.
“We have to take a look at both of the other teams just in case we’re successful on Friday so that we’re not panicked at the last minute trying to get ready for the other two. So we’ll watch tape on all three opponents,” Haley said.
One exciting announcement that came amid this week’s postseason preparations was that of Pac-10 honors. Outside hitters freshman Falyn Fonoimoana and junior Alex Jupiter, as well as junior middle blocker Lauren Williams all earned conference honors, while junior setter Kendall Bateman received an honorable mention.
“It really speaks to the rest of the team because they couldn’t do that by themselves. It just means that they probably want to sit down and thank their teammates,” Haley said.
Although the players said they appreciate the awards, Haley downplayed their significance and denied they stole focus away from the team.
“We’ll be gracious, we’ll accept them and we’ll thank our teammates, and then we’ll put them in the locker and go back to trying to win the national championship,” he said.
The Women of Troy will face off against New Mexico on Friday at 7 p.m.

Heading into the USC-UCLA game, neither team’s record is supposed to matter.
For the Trojans, that should be comforting.
Ready · Senior quarterback Mitch Mustain, who got his first start of his USC career last week, is preparing to start his second game on Saturday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
At 7-5, the Trojans likely wish they could forget their record along with the many moments they fell short this season. They don’t want to make Saturday’s 7:30 p.m. game at the Rose Bowl another one.
“It’s a must-win game for us, hands down,” said senior cornerback Shareece Wright. “We got to go out and get that victory. We can’t leave that stadium without a win.”
UCLA has had more than its share of troubles as well. The Bruins (4-7) are coming off two lopsided losses to Washington and Arizona State. After starting 3-2 and beating two ranked teams in consecutive games, UCLA’s season took a turn for the worst.
The Bruins’ lone win in their last six games, however, did come over Oregon State, the same team that dominated the Trojans 36-7 a few weeks ago.
USC, which seemed a lock to win 10 games before playing the Beavers, is trying to avoid ending the season on a three-game losing streak. The Trojans are also in need of a morale boost after a devastating loss to Notre Dame last week.
The status of sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, who did not play against the Fighting Irish because of a high-ankle sprain, is still in question. USC coach Lane Kiffin said at one point this week that Barkley would definitely play, but later backed away from that statement.
Barkley, whose participation was limited in Wednesday’s practice, said the status of his ankle has been improving daily.
“Hopefully it stays at this rate every day and three days from now it will be three times better,” Barkley said.
Backup senior quarterback Mitch Mustain made his first start of his USC career last week, completing 21-of-38 passes for 183 yards and one interception. Mustain nearly led the Trojans to a comeback, but his effort was derailed by dropped passes.
As for who will start Saturday, Kiffin is still leaning toward Barkley.
“[Matt] continues to look better every day,” Kiffin said. “He’s throwing the ball fine and his movement is coming around, so I would anticipate him playing.”
Beating UCLA might not salvage USC’s season, but losing would be unthinkable, senior cornerback Shareece Wright said.
“We definitely can’t afford that as a program to lose both to Notre Dame and UCLA in the same year,” said Wright.
Added Barkley: “Our season’s at stake, our offseason’s at stake, the pride of this school is at stake.”
Wright, who will look to enter the NFL draft next year, said a win over USC’s crosstown rival would help the program move forward going into next season.
“Just to carry it on to next season and keep the momentum going and end on a winning note and start off on a winning note next season for these young guys,” Wright said. “It’s going to be real important for them.”

During the course of their season, the Trojans’ focus has never wandered beyond their immediate opponent. Now that only two additional victories will crown the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (26-2) NCAA champions for the third consecutive year, however, it is almost surreal to reflect on how far this team has come and how little it has left to prove.
Going for goal · Junior driver Peter Kurzeka, whose 35 goals is third highest this year for USC, will lead USC against St. Francis on Saturday for a spot in the national championship against either Cal or Loyola Marymount. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans will commence their quest to three-peat this weekend at the NCAA tournament hosted by California. In the semifinal round, the Trojans will face a relative unknown No. 4 St. Francis (24-3) on Saturday at 1 p.m. If the tournament unfolds as expected, the Trojans will face No. 2 Cal (23-3), in the championship game the following day at 3 p.m. To make this titanic clash a reality, however, Cal must first handle No. 3 Loyola Marymount (19-8).
The peculiar reality of the NCAA tournament is that, on its face, it does not invite the best teams in the country, almost all of which are members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Since the Trojans downed the formidable Cardinal ­— arguably their most difficult matchup this season — in the MPSF championship game, the NCAA could not justify giving Stanford the one at-large berth in lieu of Cal, which had a better record and finished first in the MPSF regular season standings. Similarly, there was no space for a potent UCLA squad that finished third in the standings. With those two behemoths looming next year, Cal appears to be the only substantial obstacle remaining between the Trojans and defending their title.
“The MPSF tournament is, by far, the most difficult tournament to win. You’re supposed to win three hard games, and many times your first game [in the NCAA tournament] is against a lower-ranked opponent than even your first opponent in the MPSF tournament,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said.
True to form, however, Vavic refused to discuss a game plan for Cal, insisting that the team’s sole focus is St. Francis and containing its potent offense.
“St. Francis has a lot of big, athletic players from Serbia and Croatia, and they are very good offensively, with a strong goalie,” Vavic said. “We are not preparing for Cal right now. We don’t even know if Cal is going to make it to the finals. LMU is a tough team. You cannot discount LMU.”
At the beginning of the season, the program was ostensibly in rebuilding mode, trying to replenish a roster that had lost several standout senior contributors. The thought now seems laughable. Certainly, the preseason pundits who picked the Trojans to finish fourth in their own conference severely underestimated Vavic’s ability to integrate a bevy of new freshmen talent into his proven system. In fact, on Tuesday Vavic earned his combined ninth MPSF Coach of the Year honor between coaching both the USC men’s and women’s water polo teams.
Eager to dispel any chances of a letdown, Vavic has drilled into his team that this is no time to ease up. The St. Francis team knows that an upset would instantly become the signature win in its program’s history. Cal and LMU are both talented teams with which the Trojans are well-acquainted. Hopefully, the team’s character and determination will continue to shine through in critical games.
“We’ve grown together from all the way back this spring,” junior driver Peter Kurzeka — selected to the 2010 All-MPSF first team — said. “Knowing that we were losing so much talent, we knew we needed to work hard all the way through. The team has bonded and everyone has bought in.”

When you think of Christmas songs, you probably think of the classics first — “Jingle Bells” and “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”
But Christmas songs aren’t limited to the traditional tunes we hear this time of year. As the recently released Christmas album, Gift Wrapped II — Snowed In, shows, pop songs can’t always provide a little holiday cheer.
The compilation attempts to appeal to a wide audience by modernizing traditional Christmas melodies and incorporating original pop songs, but the result is simply a mash-up of hackneyed themes and genre overload.
The album features 19 tracks, half of which are generally unrecognizable — newer, hipper melodies meant to replace the more traditional carols. Still, as a whole the album lacks focus, transitioning from pop to country and rock to mockery.
For example, the silly “Merry Something to You” by Devo is quickly followed by a Beethoven-esque symphony of “Carol of the Bells” — an impractical order that only epitomizes the odd choices for the rest of the songs.
The first track, “Home for Christmas” by Cavo, is a deceptive lead-in. The song itself stands as a decent contemporary tune, almost like an updated version of “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.” The lyrics are particularly relatable and heartfelt: Time’s moving on / another year gone and I’m still believing.
But the next track, “Les Trois Cloches,” has a distinctly old-fashioned feel and verges on country rather than pop or rock. Such a shift in genres, whether one prefers country or pop, risks alienating listeners.
Tegan and Sara’s version of “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late)” is also a strange addition. The song attempts to provide a contemporary update to the classic, but the biggest problem — besides the fact that Tegan and Sara talk like chipmunks — is that the harmony overpowers the melody, making the song sound flat and off-key.
Apart from the album’s random array of genres and song choices, it’s also unnecessarily repetitive. Nearly every pop song laments a lost love or dwells on a faraway home, a theme particularly conspicuous in the male-female duets.
Had Gift Wrapped II eliminated the songs that didn’t fit this theme and been subtitled “Coming Home” or “Loving You” — a track that clearly resonated the desire to be with loved ones — then the album might have sounded more focused.
What is most puzzling is the number of non-Christmas songs throughout the album. Although the Goo Goo Dolls’ “Better Days” and Regina Spektor’s “December” are beautiful songs, how did they manage to make the cut on an album meant to be played on Christmas Day?
These songs, and others like them, are indeed contemporary but lack the direct connection to the Christmas spirit that so many traditional songs already have.
Despite the overall disorganization, about a third of the songs on the album are surprisingly decent. Gift Wrapped II shines with David Foster’s extravagant instrumental version of “Carol of the Bells.” The chorus and bridge are over-the-top explosions of sound and rhythm — perfectly amplifying an already powerful song.
Additionally, House of Heroes’ rock version of “O Come, O Come Emmanuel” is an impressive highlight. The lead singer’s voice is mesmerizing, especially in the beginning before the onset of instruments.
The song is one of the few on the album that manages to unify contemporary rock with traditional Christmas music. As the lead singer builds up to the chorus, the instruments suddenly cease, allowing the folklike melody to sink in.
The end of the album unfortunately shows the opposite of what House of Heroes’ and Foster’s versions bring to the table. Though the final track is the classic “Little Drummer Boy,” the vocals from Wayne Coyne, the lead singer of The Flaming Lips, is an atrocious choice.
His voice is consistently flat and difficult to hear: The track is a live version, but it’s not evident why. The audio is fuzzy, the instruments are too loud and the lead singer’s vocals are soft and shaky.
Gift Wrapped II — Snowed In is not exactly a failed Christmas compilation — it’s more of a gutsy attempt to sound simultaneously modern and traditional, new and cultured. But it can’t decide what it wants to be or who its target audience is, and, unfortunately, these questions are never answered.

Net neutrality.
It’s a term that you might have heard, but the definition probably isn’t clear. Even to those who debate the issue, the subject material is vast and the implications are many.
Net neutrality refers to Internet providers offering their services without any sort of restriction that limits access.  With Level 3 Communications’ new spat with Comcast Corporation over the delivery of Netflix content, it’s about time that everyone became aware of the issue at hand.
Netflix, the online subscription-based video service, has practically taken over the market. The term “juggernaut” is actually an understatement when describing the company, which has expanded to deliver content through a plethora of platforms (televisions, computers, iPhones and iPads, Xbox 360s and Nintendo Wiis — and the list goes on), eventually reaching more than 9 million customers in 2008.
This has made it necessary for Netflix to find bigger, better content delivery networks. After all, you can’t hold up 17 percent of all Internet traffic without a powerful, flexible network.
And so Netflix has given Level 3 Communications most of the delivery job (though others, such as Akamai and Limelight, will pitch in).
But that’s not where this story ends. In turn, Level 3 must deal with cable companies — in this case, Comcast — to get the content onto the screens of Weeds-deprived users all over the country.
This is where things have currently come to a head, and it all goes back to that magical number: 17 percent.
Comcast claims that as part of the new agreement, it will be receiving five times more traffic from Level 3 than before, requiring it to charge Level 3 an extra fee outside of its normal peering contract.
Otherwise, Comcast has stated, it will need to pass on the greater costs brought on by the new network stress onto itself and cable customers. Level 3, however, is saying that Comcast forcing them to pay such a fee is against the principles of net neutrality.
Put simply, net neutrality is a term describing the condition in which user access networks (in this scenario, Comcast Cable) do not put restrictions on the sort of content, sites, platforms, attached equipment or modes of communications that is to be on the network.
“Restrictions” can mean discriminatory fees levied against certain types of content (say, Netflix) and not others.
Comcast has countered this argument by pointing out that it has held commercial contracts (where there is a fee, unlike in a peering arrangement/contract) with some of Level 3’s competitors and that Level 3 is merely crying foul in order to undercut normal fees.
Could Comcast be using its market dominance to leverage a company with a very significant client into paying up?
It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Comcast showed some disingenuous behavior on its part.
Let’s take a look at Comcast’s peer-to-peer sharing issues as a first example. In late 2006, Comcast began using hardware that disrupted multiple protocols used by file sharing networks, preventing users from uploading files.
Although Comcast claimed it was attempting to protect copyright laws, many critics said that instead it was a tactic used to manage traffic on their network.
There have also been connections made about Comcast’s competition with companies such as Netflix with Comcast’s merger with NBC Universal as well as the development of its own video-delivery program.
For these reasons, there are some fears of powerful cable/broadband companies such as Comcast eventually putting up hypothetical “toll booths” for customers and clients to have to pay in order to deliver and access info on the Web.
Perhaps Level 3 is simply crying wolf over the issue, but it does bring up an important issue: How will net neutrality be preserved in years to come?
The Internet was created as an open platform, where any parties could freely share information without fear of prioritization over another source. It’s this principle that has made the Internet such a hot spot for innovation and collaboration.
But the rise of the technology has also led to the rise of a few gigantic corporations with the power to control the information superhighway. But the surrounding debate surrounding the Neftlix/Level 3 catfight with Comcast has serious implications for the way we will surf the Web every single day.
So the question is: Will you be able to speak up about net neutrality when your beloved content is on the line?

Between 1956 and 1959, French film legend and comic genius Jacques Tati wrote an original script about a magician and a young girl. Meant as a love letter from father to daughter, the story was too serious and too personal for Tati himself to produce.
2-D · The Illusionist eschews modern CGI for  more old-fashioned, hand drawn animation. - Photos courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 
It remained untouched for 50 years in the possession of Tati’s daughter until it found its way to Sylvain Chomet, director of the Oscar-nominated animated film, The Triplets of Belleville.
In The Illusionist, Chomet has lovingly adapted Tati’s poignant script, using his characteristic hand-drawn style of animation to quietly capture the innocence of a bygone era.
The Illusionist is a mostly silent film about a stone-faced, old-fashioned magician named Tatischeff, an animated version of Tati himself. Specializing in pulling a rabbit out of a hat or turning a deck of cards into a bouquet of flowers, Tatischeff represents a brand of stage entertainment that no longer seems relevant with the coming of rock ‘n’ roll in the late ’50s.
After playing to empty houses and distracted crowds in Paris and London, Tatischeff takes a job performing at a pub on a behind-the-times island off the west coast of Scotland where the people are celebrating the arrival of electricity.
Here he meets Alice, a young girl awestruck by the illusionist’s tricks, which she believes are real magic. Seeing her tattered clothes, Tatischeff “conjures” a pair of new shoes for the girl, who is so enchanted she follows him to Edinburgh, Scotland.
They seem to instantly take up the roles of father and daughter, staying together in a boarding house populated with other struggling vaudeville performers (in the innocent world of the film, there is never a question of the girl’s parents or Tatischeff’s intentions).
Tatischeff hides his financial difficulties from Alice in an effort to keep up the illusion of magic as he continues to provide pieces of the sophisticated, grown-up wardrobe she dreams of having. But as times change and Alice matures, the illusionist becomes disillusioned with his own tricks.
With only snippets of mumbled dialogue, The Illusionist is a triumph of visual storytelling. In the vein of an old Chaplin or Keaton film, Chomet finds universal humor and pathos in very specific moments.
When Alice walks in her first pair of high heels, the same pair she had been looking at through a store window, she awkwardly tries to look as sophisticated as possible, knees wobbling like a baby deer trying its fragile legs for the first time.
It is a moment viewers recognize with affection, as a girl on the verge of adulthood naively imitates the women she hopes to become.
The small, incredibly human moments such as this one provide the quiet energy of the film.
The world Chomet creates for Tatischeff — and there is a strong sense of Chomet’s devotion to the illusionist — is filled with a wonderfully quirky cast of characters. Tatischeff’s grumpy, red-eyed rabbit fruitlessly struggles every time he is put in a hat, but it is obvious that there is a level of mutual affection between man and rabbit, no matter how deeply buried.
Among the vaudevillians at the boarding house is a drunk, emaciated clown who, at one point, is on the verge of committing suicide when Alice knocks on the door to bring him some dinner, restoring his faith.
Even though none of the characters join in conversation on screen, there is a permeating sense of camaraderie between them, a sense in which the audience can partake as well.
It is to the credit of Chomet’s beautifully old-fashioned animation that the director is able to visually convey so much. The lovely imperfections of the 2-D, hand-drawn style are able to capture a sadness and an intense nostalgia that the crisp, plastic images of today’s Disney (even in its recent return to “traditional” animation in The Princess and the Frog or this month’s Tangled) never could.
Although characters might have stylistically exaggerated features, the audience can still feel as if it is watching something real. Chomet tends to avoid close-ups and the typical shot-reverse-shot pattern in favor of deep focus long takes, as if the “camera” is simply observing.
In the most visually stunning shot of the film, that “camera” takes off from atop a mountain, providing a breathtaking panorama of Edinburgh that is as true to the spirit of the city as any photographic image could be.
The Illusionist is a slow-moving film, meandering along from scene to scene with no obvious thrust. But if one is able to adjust to the pace and simply inhabit Tatischeff’s changing world, there are endlessly perfect little moments of slapstick humor, true human connection or deeply felt nostalgia.
The innocence and simplicity of the storytelling convey a lamentation of the passage of time, of growing up and losing magic. Chomet directs the film with a magic of his own, as well as a deep affection and respect for Tati that allows him to capture the depth of emotion packed into this subtle tale.
The Illusionist might be Tati’s story, but it could not have found its way into better hands.

Throughout much of Black Swan, the new psychological thriller from director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler), Natalie Portman speaks barely above a whisper, as if the sound of her voice might offend anyone who hears it.
Photo courtesy of Fox Searchlight
As Nina, the young ballerina cast as the lead in a reimagining of Swan Lake, Portman is soft and fragile, a far cry from the manic pixie dream girls she played in Garden State or Closer.
Nina’s problem, as she’s told repeatedly, is that she needs to loosen up. She’s frigid and cold, a product of her own insecurities. To fully embody the dual lead role of Swan Lake as the white swan who loses her lover, and the black swan who tempts him, she needs to get in touch with her dark side.
At its heart, Black Swan is a film about a woman who finds her inner beauty in the worst possible way.
Like The Wrestler before it, Black Swan focuses on an athlete intensely dedicated to her craft, even when it begins to affect the rest of her life.
Nina eats grapefruit and a poached egg for breakfast. Her ankles crack and pop, beat down from years of abuse. In one scene, she refuses herself a celebratory slice of cake, a sign that she strives to stay unhealthily thin, as many dancers do.
When the director of the ballet company, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), decides he needs a new star to headline his revamped Swan Lake, he casts Nina. He has his misgivings. He’s seen a glimmer of simmering sexuality inside Nina that he regards as necessary for the role, but she can’t seem to reconnect with it.
When Lily (Mila Kunis) moves from San Francisco and joins the company, Nina begins to worry that the new dancer is vying for her spot. As Nina battles her own shortcomings, paranoia sets in, leading her to a series of hallucinations, losing her grip on reality.
Black Swan isn’t the most original story. It features plenty of cheap “Gotcha!” scares, and a boatload of “Wait, was that real?” moments.
It operates in the same area as this year’s earlier movie Shutter Island which also revolves around a character coming to grips with his own mind, and, like Black Swan, it didn’t break any new ground in the genre.
What set Shutter Island apart from other films were its stunning Hitchcock-inspired visuals and a gripping performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Aronofsky and Portman save Black Swan from its familiar story in the same way.
For Black Swan, Aronofsky reteams with Matthew Libatique, who worked as cinematographer on Pi and Requiem for a Dream. It’s a welcome reunion.
Aronofsky almost exclusively employs handheld cameras in his films, a technique that no doubt harkens back to his New York indie roots, when he didn’t have the time to do anything complicated with the camera or have the money to afford a tripod.
Sometimes, as with The Wrestler, it gives his films a cheap look. Here, Aronofsky and Libatique use the handheld camera to great effect. It allows them to be fluid, quick and, like their subjects, balletic.
Aronofsky sometimes risks overdoing his visuals. As would be expected from the play within the film, the art design contrasts black and white imagery. Most of the sets are painted in these two colors, and in some scenes, Nina wears white clothes, while everyone else wears black.
It lacks any subtlety, a bang-you-over-the-head reminder of Nina’s internal conflict. But Aronofsky redeems himself with his direction. When paired with Clint Mansell’s powerful score, Libatique’s lens elevates a run-of-the-mill story to a fierce, terrifying foray into a fractured mind.
Ultimately, however, this is Portman’s moment. The rest of the cast works well. Kunis’ beach-girl delivery suits the unrestrained Lily, and there is no better actor to play a French jerk than Cassel. Barbara Hershey as Nina’s mother might have created the creepiest on-screen mom since Piper Laurie in Carrie.
But it’s Portman who soars. Without a doubt, she’ll be an Oscar contender this year — and deservedly so. In discovering Nina’s black swan, she finds a side she’s never shown audiences before, and one the audience will find it hard to forget.
Black Swan is a testament to Aronofsky and Portman’s respective skills. Through their delicate work, they took a potentially familiar story into a stylistic exploration of the mind.
It sounds like you’re trying to go out of your way to be overly critical of a brilliant film to sound smart, but instead, you just sound pretentious.

General education courses: love them or hate them, you’ve got to take them. As a liberal arts institution, one of USC’s core missions is to expose its undergraduates to a vast array of subjects before they commit to a particular field of study.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Still, this does not change the fact that these requirements are usually met with discontent by USC students. Thus, if G.E. courses are a must, then perhaps there are some changes that could be made to ease the experience.
The idea behind the G.E. program is that each student is provided a comprehensive education so they are able to handle the intersection of academic disciplines as they might later arise in the real world.
By the time many of us reach college we have an idea of what we want to study — but these aspirations are bound to change. It is not uncommon to find a physics-turned-English-major because often our initial career goals are driven by factors such as family pressure, future income or what might appear to be a “glamorous” occupation.
Upon reaching college, we realize that these reasons are not enough to successfully motivate us for the next four years, let alone the rest of our professional careers.
So, if G.E. courses are so adept at providing us with a well-rounded education, why the cries of protest?
To begin with, students are worried about their futures. Sure, there are those among us that get a rush simply through the process of learning or that aspire to a 4.0 grade point average because it is personally satisfying, but it’s also likely that we are worried about succeeding our majors or what future employers or schools will deem acceptable.
Within a given G.E. category, some classes are clearly more difficult than others, whether that means more papers, more exams or even just more reading. Is it fair, then, that all of these classes, are valued with equal amounts of credits, regardless of difficulty, making their grade contribute to our GPAs equally?
There needs to be a more concerted effort to standardize the level of difficulty. This might seem too lofty a goal, but there are steps that can contribute to establishing a more equal playing field.
It is not fair, for example, to have one social issues course that requires three essays in addition to Writing and Critical Reasoning (WRIT 140) component, and another that requires nothing more than reading.
Perhaps it’s time to begin considering new formats for general education.
One of the more obvious solutions is to make all G.E. courses pass/no-pass.
This would still allow students to benefit from taking classes in a variety of classes without punishing them for choosing a course with a distinctly heavier workload than its other category counterparts.
Some might counter that this pass/no-pass system would essentially promote mediocrity in G.E. courses, but that’s not necessarily true.
There will always be people that search for an easy out in any situation, but it’s also likely that students will begin to choose their G.E. courses based on genuine interest in content and professors, instead of signing up solely based on ease as predicted by RateMyProfessors.com and previous students.
This would also allow students to focus the bulk of their energy on their major-oriented courses —  which, after all, is what brought them here.
Between picking a major, paying for school, planning for the future and having a life beyond academics, college students have enough things to balance.
Maybe somewhere down the road we can look forward to a little slack in the courses we’re required to take so we can focus on the ones we choose to.

Honestly the GE system has so much potential, but it’s a complete joke.
They need to broaden the categories to:
Cat 1: Take ANY Western Phil/ History/Religion class at USC with option of (pass/no pass)
Cat 2: Take ANY non-western Phil/ History/Religion class at USC with option of (pass/no pass)
Cat 3: Take ANY science/psych/astronomy class at USC with option of (pass/no pass)
Cat 4: Take ANY social science/linguistics/ir/poli sci class at USC with option of (pass/no pass)
Cat 5: Take ANY Literature/English class at USC with option of (pass/no pass)
Cat 6: Take a Social Issues class from a list of 10, with writing 140. Make it project based- so you have no homework in the class, 1 lecture a week, and then a social issues project with class members. Independent, on the class 1) It’s good to help out in the community, 2) Social Issues are only addressed in the field, 3) Writing 140 has too much repetitiveness making Cat 6 SO DULL. Make this COMPULSORY PASS/NO PASS. (No GPA)
This will 1) not screw up kids who cant cope with college freshman year, save time and give exploration to those who are searching for a subject, and will give those pledging a social or professional fraternity the benefit of not worrying about a GPA that semester.
2) It will actually make the GE system worthwhile so you can learn what you want, actually turn up to GEs, and probably put in effort. 
You could also structure the writing 140 curriculum differently, but thats a separate can of worms.
GE classes should be “pass/no pass.” There shouldn’t be a limit on how many GE courses that can be taken on the “pass/no pass” basis. There is obviously favoritism in these classes, especially when it comes to grading. Some of these instructors of GE courses are jerks because it’s the only powertrip they get to demonstrate; it’s your fault that you couldn’t hack a more rigorous major a la engineering, pre-med, computer science. The jerk professor or jerk TA wants to butcher your grade because he/she doesn’t like you…Yeah, sure, your academic discipline is an “exact science”…my butt, LOL!
So I agree Deepa, “majoring in minor things” is useless. There should only be a GPA that denotes core/concentration classes, not GEs.
Not to be rude, but this article is terribly written.  Seriously, take a writing class.
I agree!  It’s so ironic too given the topic of the article…ohh Daily Trojan..

The Syfy show, Hollywood Treasure, depicts the hunt for famous memorabilia from classic films.
Many of those special items — marked-up scripts, trophies and a lot of Hollywood’s most memorable moments — are located here on the USC campus.
Although non-cinema students might occasionally notice USC’s close ties with the film industry, they might not be aware of the behind-the-scenes effort to preserve Hollywood’s most precious moments for our intellectual benefit.

Perhaps no one knows the rich history between USC and Hollywood better than Steve Hanson, head of the Cinematic Arts Library, and Sandra Garcia-Myers, the assistant director.
“Our relations with Hollywood were being built since the 1930s,” said Myers as he and I observed the Hugh Hefner Gallery at the cinema school. “And it’s a continual cycle. It’s only getting bigger and bigger.”
Interest in donating items to USC has skyrocketed over the last few years.
What started as a group of film professors giving their memorabilia to the cinema school sprouted into a full-fledged effort from many in Hollywood to donate their items to the university.
“At first, a lot of professors would come in and ask,‘You want my stuff?’ Often they would donate items from their own garage,” Hanson said. “Now the relationship is stronger than ever. … The new cinema building has made it easier for people from Hollywood to come see our exhibits, who in turn call us up to donate their own items.”
The preservation of Hollywood history is undoubtedly a testament to our university mission, as we strive to be the single focal point of motion picture and television research — as opposed to other competitive institutions such as UCLA, the Smithsonian Institute and the Library of Congress.
USC’s role in preserving Hollywood history has allowed us to reconnect with our past. For more than a decade, Hanson said plans were made to create a John Wayne exhibit at the cinema school.
Though Wayne gave away most of his memorabilia to the public, his son, Michael, worked to regain these items in the interest of putting them on display on campus.
Hanson said Michael Wayne, who died in 2003, was able to fill 27 storage units of his father’s collectibles at the time of his death. Beginning this week, the school’s archives will be collecting thousands of posters and production materials from Wayne’s career.
“That became his life commitment,” Hanson said. “He went to auctions and other events to get his father’s things back. Now his work will be preserved here at USC. … What we do is about relationships, and these people will keep coming back.”
Perhaps the greatest benefit of safeguarding Hollywood memorabilia — a significant aspect of Los Angeles history — is that USC students can gain a new appreciation for the industry right at their own doorstep.
It only takes a walk over to Hefner Gallery to see what items are at our fingertips.
Here you will find a mix of modern memorabilia, such as the Batman suit used in Dark Knight, and items that have been preserved over time, such as the marked-up script of West Side Story.
“Hugh Hefner [has] a love for classics,” Myers said, “He donated the gallery for this reason. … Preserving the fullest picture of Hollywood history. We hope that students can also have a appreciation and understanding of the industry.”
Clearly, part of our university mission is to enrich our minds with the vast resources and opportunities available to us.
Yet, the other part of our mission is to continue to demonstrate the Trojan Family at work, just as it has in the past.
“We stand on the shoulders of greats. And the thrill of having a USC student becoming influenced by a script we preserve, that carries on a tradition,” Hanson said.
Myers ended with one piece of valuable advice: “Don’t throw anything away. You can contribute to a piece of history.”
