Students in the School of Cinematic Arts production program have launched a petition to pause the school’s production courses should the University decide to continue remote instruction through Fall 2020.
The petition, which has amassed more than 700 signatures to date, asks SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley to place the track on hold for the duration of next semester in the event that classes remain online. It argued that access to in-person resources is a cornerstone of the University’s production courses, and the classes cannot be replicated remotely.
According to Daley, SCA will not consider suspending any of its degree programs and plans to modify courses for an online format if in-person classes do not resume as scheduled in August.
The interruption to students’ academic progress caused by temporarily suspending the production program would pose an insurmountable difficulty for students whose circumstances prohibit them from extending the timeline of their degrees, Daley said.
“Nothing is a perfect solution, but we’re looking at all the scenarios that we can, and we are definitely not going to close down,” Daley said. “When something goes wrong on a movie set, you don’t close it down — you move ahead.”
Gerardo Garcia, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production who helped organize the petition, said the production classes at SCA emphasize hands-on and collaborative philosophies that don’t come through in a virtual format.
“Currently, our production classes have shifted to online, and it’s not the same effect — we’re not learning the same tools that we would have learned,” Garcia said. “It’s all very conceptual, and although the conceptual aspect is important, USC — and SCA specifically — markets itself on its physical production education.”
Garcia cited the “Advanced Production Workshop” class production students take in the fall of their senior year as part of the production curriculum lost in the online format. The class culminates with a $10,000-budget movie, an experience he said would be eliminated if the course is held online next semester.
“If physical production courses don’t fit on an online medium, why force it?” Garcia said. “It sort of feels like SCA’s best interests are in their financials, and they’re not taking the time to consider our educational consequences if we continued online.”
Ashlyn Bradshaw, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said she does not plan to sign the petition. She said the degree plan for the production major would make it difficult to ensure a timely graduation for current students if courses were suspended for a semester.
“It’s just tricky because the production course for fall and spring admits is so compacted,” Bradshaw said. “Unless they figured out a way where maybe our major didn’t need as many requirements or they took a class away, I don’t really see how pausing it would work in terms of getting us all out in four years.”
Garcia said administrators should take into consideration elements of the curriculum that can’t be conducted remotely. He said the filming equipment SCA provides and the opportunity to shoot films with other students in the production cohort are central to instruction and part of what attracts students to the program.
“I think if they really respected their education, they would pause the production track and just wait until we go back to doing classes in person,” Garcia said. “That is a big portion of what physical production is: learning the tools and collaborating.”
Daley said that while pausing the production track is not a possibility, SCA administrators and faculty have begun to look at alternative course plans should in-person classes not resume in August.
“In the fall, we’ve looked at a bunch of different scenarios,” Daley said. “Maybe we’ll get to come back just like we always do, but if that doesn’t happen, then how could we work in smaller groups, how could we shift the curriculum a little bit perhaps so that maybe you take certain courses in the fall that work a little better online and some of the other courses get delayed until either later in the fall or spring?”

I thought about writing this column on the way the NFL handled going virtual for its draft that started Thursday and ended Saturday but decided against it for two reasons. The first was that there were surprisingly few technical difficulties, and it would be boring if I just wrote about everything that went right.
The second is that for the first time in a month and a half, the world felt almost normal. With teams overdrafting quarterbacks, the awkward shots of family celebrating alongside a player’s temporary girlfriend and the Patriots trading back out of the first round, the virtual draft gave me the same feeling as the typical event, and I want to hold onto that feeling as I continue to figure out how to live in quarantine.
So in that spirit, I want to do the most archetypal recap of an NFL Draft possible: Here are my big takeaways from an intriguing weekend.
All that talk about Tua Tagovailoa’s hip was just that — talk
There was a lot of gossip in the lead-up to the draft that Tagovailoa’s injury history — specifically the season-ending dislocated hip he suffered against Mississippi State in November — would cause him to fall out of the top-five selection his talent warrants. There were even reports that he was off some teams’ boards altogether and that the Dolphins, who started the 2019 season so poorly that the phrase “Tank for Tua” became the fan base’s motto, were seriously considering taking Justin Herbert over Tagovailoa at five.
That ended up being a lot of hooey, because the Dolphins did take Tagovailoa at five. Perhaps those reports were a smoke screen set up by Miami so it wouldn’t have to trade up to get its guy after unexpectedly winning its final two games of the season. Regardless, the selection shows that teams are willing to bet on game-breaking talent such as Tagovailoa’s despite the uncertainty.
Aaron Rodgers is going to be even more prissy than usual
It’s not just that the Packers traded up in the first round to take Jordan Love, a talented quarterback prospect who Green Bay is surely grooming to be its next franchise signal-caller. It’s that the Packers also did nothing to address their areas of need that would’ve made things easier on Rodgers and help them surpass the level they reached last year, when they were clearly outclassed by the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.
First and foremost, Green Bay didn’t take one wide receiver in the deepest class at that position in a long time, so Rodgers will have to depend only on Davante Adams for another season. The team also took a lot of interior offensive linemen but no tackles, which is where its real need up front is, and didn’t select a cornerback.
Rodgers is known for being a diva, but this is only going to make his moodiness worse. When he said on “The Pat McAfee Show” that he wanted the Packers to take a skill position player in the first round for the first time since he became the starter, I don’t think drafting his replacement is what he had in mind.
The Cowboys and Cardinals took advantage of falling talent
Two of the biggest winners of the draft took advantage of other teams overthinking their needs or misevaluating talent. The Cardinals got Isaiah Simmons, one of the most versatile defensive prospects in draft history, at eight, and as a result got a guy who has a good chance to be one of the three best players in the draft. They also lucked out when offensive tackle Josh Jones, projected by most evaluators to go at the end of the first round, inexplicably fell all the way to No. 72, allowing them to go with the best player available in the first round and address their major need with an elite prospect.
The Cowboys did even better. They snapped up CeeDee Lamb as the third receiver off the board after he fell all the way to No. 17. They also grabbed two borderline first-round-caliber talents at positions of need in the second and third rounds in cornerback Trevon Diggs and defensive lineman Neville Gallimore. Perhaps their best value came at pick No. 179 in defensive end Bradlee Anae, who easily could have gone 100 picks earlier.
The Jets are finally prioritizing Sam Darnold
The former Trojan signal-caller’s career has been hard to evaluate thus far for two reasons: He hasn’t had any sort of talent around him, and, relatedly, he’s missed a fair amount of time due to injury. The Jets’ offensive line and weapons have been dismal since Darnold was drafted in 2018, so it’s hard to know if his flashes of success more accurately describe who he is as a player or describe the team’s frequent inability to move the ball.
New York is certainly doing more to give its franchise quarterback the tools he needs, drafting a mountain of a man in offensive tackle Mekhi Becton (6-foot-7, 365 lbs) who also has the nimble feet to protect Darnold’s blind side. The Jets also addressed a major wide receiver need by stealing Denzel Mims at pick No. 59, providing Darnold with an exemplary outside receiver to throw jump balls to, and continued to fill out the offensive line by taking Cameron Clark, who has the ability to fill multiple positions should one of New York’s presumptive starters get hurt.
For three nights, it felt like football was back again, and clearly, the NFL landscape will look a little different next season, whenever that may come.

As exciting as it is when Lil Uzi Vert drops new music, his new single “Sasuke” falls short of expectations — if you even had enough time to conjure up any with the surprise release. What is exciting, however, is the wave of speculation following the track and Uzi’s hyperactivity online.
After dropping the long-anticipated album “Eternal Atake,” Uzi has taken to social media, often engaging with fans on Twitter as well as other artists. One artist in particular, who recently returned to the music scene, has the focal point of Uzi’s recent tweets and fan interactions. This artist, of course, is Playboi Carti. After two years since the release of his critically acclaimed album “Die Lit,” Carti has finally put out his own music, with a single titled, “@ MEH.”
This review is just as much about Carti as it is Uzi since the two have been going back and forth for unknown reasons on Twitter, fueling speculation of “beef” between the two long time collaborators and friends. In the midst of this tension, Carti dropped his single on April 16, which was followed by Uzi’s “Sasuke,” released Friday night, more than a week later. 
In this track, Uzi uses the infamous baby voice; a recent trend in the hip-hop community, with none other than Carti at the forefront of it all. 645AR’s “4 Da Trap” is an example of the baby voice use going viral as the song was featured in countless memes. The voice, along with Uzi’s cadence and adlibs, makes the track eerily similar to Carti’s style. Yet, because of this, this track is probably less of a serious release and rather part of a larger promotional plan for Carti’s highly anticipated album, “Whole Lotta Red”— just my guess. 
In a response to one of Carti’s tweets alluding to his new album, Uzi quote-tweeted asking the rapper, “Did u drop yet?” All of this teaser material points to a collaboration between the two artists rather than a beef, with Uzi playfully mimicking Carti’s typing style and also showing an alternate cover to Carti’s single. Their recent tweets professing their love for each other add more to the mix. “Sasuke” perfectly fits into this scheme, but it doesn’t mean it’s a great track.
The song does have a Carti-esque nature, but it also sounds like a generic Uzi song. References to fashion, sexual innuendos and cars in the typical Uzi delivery make for nothing special. The title of the track refers to Sasuke Uchiha, a character from the Naruto universe. The anime theme has been a large part of Uzi’s recent image, with his car collection featuring various anime-inspired designs catching lots of online attention.
The repetitive nature of the track grows tiresome by the middle. It doesn’t feel like an actual song, especially in the midst of this online feud, but rather as a demo of what Uzi would sound like if he was copying Carti. Coming off not only the “Eternal Atake” drop but also the deluxe version, “Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2,” (which can stand alone as an album) it’s strange to see Uzi again after a long hiatus. 
If a Carti-Uzi project is truly in the works, it might mean that an entire collaborative album could be on its way since a project between the two, “16*29” was teased as early as 2017. The two seemingly simultaneous drops from each artist certainly add fuel to the fire since fans have been waiting for another Carti-Uzi song after the immense success from songs like “Shoota,” “wokeuplikethis*” and “Of Course We Ghetto Flowers.”
“Sasuke” is not going to have a lasting legacy like Lil Uzi Vert’s other hits. Though, the hype drawn from it and Uzi’s constant Twitter interactions hinting at a Playboi Carti collaboration have certainly made it a better listen than it is alone.

The 1975 is back, with its seventh single from the highly anticipated upcoming album, “Notes On A Conditional Form.” Filled with catchy lyrics and a lively saxophone, the track “If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know)” is the type of serotonin boost that we all need right now. 
The band also released a black and white music video the same day, April 23, to accompany the new single. In the video, the group plays side-by-side with frontman Matty Healy sporting a punk aesthetic and happily dancing along to the song. 
“If You’re Too Shy” sounds straight out of a coming-of-age movie, right when the main character and their love interest suddenly fall for each other in a dreamy montage sequence. Although that sort of fanciful scene probably won’t happen while social distancing, the song still makes you want to joyfully dance in your bedroom.  
The single begins with a soft instrumental, jumping into an upbeat track that is energetic, fun and easy to dance to. Healy goes on to describe his relationship with a mystery girl he met online. The lyrics are provocative and lustful, especially at the chorus when Healy sings: “She said, Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes / I wanna see and stop thinking / If you’re too shy then let me — too shy then let me know.” 
The song could be interpreted in different ways, especially when its bold and merry tempo enhances the risqué lyrics. In an interview with Annie Mac from BBC Radio 1’s “Future Sounds,” Healy said “It’s about the idea of chasing connection, it’s about getting naked on FaceTime … It’s the lighter version of some of the observations of what we’re up to on the internet.” 
Throughout the song, Healy sings about wanting to see the girl he saw on the screen, an allusion to either pornography or a girl he just met on the internet. Although he has feelings for her, she easily intimidates him: “But I see her online, and I don’t think that I should be calling / All the time, I just wanted a happy ending / And I’m pretending I don’t care ‘bout her stare / While she’s giving me a tough time.” 
The band has previously tackled themes of love in the digital age since their third album “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.” Their forthcoming album is a continuation of these themes, and “If You’re Too Shy” plays as a perfect introspective social commentary. 
The sound of “If You’re Too Shy” is reminiscent of the band’s alternative music that appeared in its debut self-titled album. With its ’80s-inspired synth pop sound and double entendres, “If You’re Too Shy” is similar to the band’s other songs “Chocolate” and “Girls.” It’ll most likely become a 1975 classic, combining the band’s take on online love with a pop-rock style and giving us a reason to smile and dance amid quarantine. 
Although the song was formally released April 23, the band originally debuted the track during a February concert; from that moment, fans have eagerly anticipated the new single. 
Along with Thursday’s release, the band has released the tracks “The Birthday Party” and “Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America” as singles for its upcoming album. In comparison to these mellow tracks, “If You’re Too Shy” is more rose-tinted and tech-themed. An edit of “If You’re Too Shy” was also released with backup vocals from English singer and songwriter FKA Twigs. 
The 1975’s fourth studio album “Notes On a Conditional Form” is set to release May 22.

My favorite moment of any Barry Jenkins movie happens in his junior picture “If Beale Street Could Talk” (2018), about a quarter of the way in. Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) exit a nice restaurant where they’ve just received special treatment from one of Fonny’s old pals, Pedrocito (Diego Luna). The couple step out of the restaurant, but Fonny lingers, probably to land a parting dig at Pedro. As she does throughout the whole film, Tish narrates the moment in a tender tone:
“I had never seen Fonny outside the world in which I moved,” she says. “Perhaps it was only now I was able to see him with me; because, even though he was turned away laughing, he was holding my hand.” 
At first the camera singles her out, but as she nears the turn of the phrase it cuts to reveal Fonny’s hand firmly wound around hers. Even as the rest of his body is turned away, this is where he wants to be. 
I would never reduce a filmmaker’s work down to one theme (even if that filmmaker has only made three movies), but what I’ve found most impressive about Jenkins’ work is his ability to create a consistent visual language — his movies define love almost solely in visual terms. Pretentious as the cliche may be, I think if filmmaking is defined as “writing with light,” Jenkins is one of the most genuine working filmmakers.
That moment in “Beale Street” works without Tish’s narration, for the director has already established in this film (as well as his previous work) that true love is about connection. When those of us acquainted with Jenkins’ work think about our experience when watching his movies, doubtless we think of specific shots; of these, Jenkins’ single shot is chief. He does it in “Medicine for Melancholy” (2008), “Moonlight” (2016) and “Beale Street” — a character stands right in front of the camera gazing directly at the lens and, spiritually, at the audience on the other side. The shot is an invitation to stop and consider characters, to get to know them, one at a time.
How can these lonely frames define love as connection? Does connection even matter if we constantly see people by themselves? To answer the positive: Jenkins takes pains, not so much to explore the intricacies of every character, but to argue that knowing another person — or, at least, taking the time to know someone — is crucial. 
Jenkins does not humanize characters — he lets them exist as the humans they already are. (“Humanizing” characters is really an absurd thing to commend a director for. Those characters were human before the camera got there. It’s how one interprets that humanity that matters.) In those single shots, characters have no prop, usually only a static background — nothing but themselves. The result is a powerful assertion that the person standing smack in the middle of our screen is worth at least a few seconds of our undivided attention simply because they are human.
Really, the fact that Jenkins feels the need to so blatantly tell us, straight up, to pay attention to someone, says less about the characters and more about how we’ve been conditioned as an audience to expect rapid movement in the films we watch — that’s why these portrait shots feel “disruptive” to the plot. Like a novelist taking up a page to detail a landscape with elegant language, Jenkins uses his camera to patiently detail bodies, faces and eyes. 
When you’ve established each character as complex and powerful in and of themselves, each film becomes a journey (for the audience and the other characters) to understand another person. Jenkins’ films aren’t always so simple and so joyful as a shot of intertwined hands, though. 
The most complicated relationship in “Moonlight” is the one between Chiron and his mother Paula (Naomie Harris). When Chiron is a boy (Alex Hibbert), Paula yells at him with all her might — “Don’t look at me!” Yet, never in this recurring moment are the characters seen in the same frame. Both Chiron and Paula are laid bare by the single shot; it’s as if Paula feels the implications of being framed by herself. She is being judged by her son and by us. In a Jenkins project, to stare is to know. Paula knows her imperfections, and she doesn’t want anyone else to call her out, let alone her son.
Nevertheless, Jenkins implores the audience to understand — Paula’s coarse shouting is constantly replayed for us so that we can relive that moment with Chiron, struggling alongside him to be reconciled with its cruelty. Decades later, the mother and son meet for a final gut-wrenching conversation. Eventually, they are literally pressed together into the frame, Chiron embracing his frail mother, wrapping almost his whole body around her. 
In a Jenkins film, the worst fate anyone can suffer is never sharing the frame, never connecting, left perpetually naked for the audience to judge (see Officer Bell in “Beale Street”). No matter how cruel Paula was to Chiron, he knows, sooner or later, they must connect. They are mother and son. They cannot stand in separate frames forever. 
Just as we stare and evaluate each face presented to us in these portrait shots, Jenkins’ characters themselves are constantly struggling to evaluate their identities. Chiron, chief among Jenkins’ searchers, is tossed about like ocean waves as almost every person in his life has a say in who he is or who he is supposed to be. The most heart-wrenching shot in “Moonlight” is one of young Chiron alone in a bathtub. He has discovered both Paula and his surrogate father Juan (Mahershala Ali) to be inadequate authorities on the question of identity. Chiron sits in the tub, looking around, looking up as if for Divine revelation; the moment marks his life for worse — he remains convinced he is all alone.
Hope for Chiron, Tish, Fonny — and in “Medicine for Melancholy,” Micah and Joanne — comes in romance, a romance with someone who actually comprehends them. Tish and Fonny have known each other since childhood (“bone of bone, flesh of flesh” they call each other, even before marriage). Chiron is drawn to Kevin because he’s the only person with whom Chiron expresses the emotions he keeps hidden from everyone else. 
In Jenkins’ debut film, Joanne is dating a white guy we don’t see during her day with Micah. She fits so well with Micah, though, because he knows who she really is; he even takes her to the Museum of the African Diaspora to awaken her to her historical identity. The lovely Micah knows how to woo her and show her a good time, while the implication is that her boyfriend is aloof to all things romantic.  
In “Medicine for Melancholy,” we spend a lot of time in Micah’s apartment, listening to the couple share secrets, fears and political concerns. If the highest show of friendship, trust and love in Jenkins’ movies is to welcome someone into your frame, the audience is given the great privilege in all of these films to enter private spaces like this one and fully grasp who these people are. 
If Jenkins’ single shots constantly reinforce the complexity of individual identities, then, quite naturally, it is very thrilling when two such people connect and the director allows us to see it. 
So if holding hands is that exciting in all Jenkins’ movies, a first kiss, needless to say, means everything.

It’s hard to look for the positives when so much is crashing around us. 
As death tolls and unemployment rates climb, the pandemic continues to lay bare inequalities that went undiscussed in the public eye for too long. Black, Native and immigrant communities are dying at higher rates from the coronavirus in many parts of the country, likely due to socioeconomic and health disparities in majority-marginalized neighborhoods. Essential workers at major chains make small hourly wages and have to protest for paid sick leave, a few extra dollars in hazard pay and protective materials in the workplace such as masks and soap. Small businesses are shutting their doors and the resources from a  $349 billion fund meant to help them dried up in its first round because major chains had the resources to apply faster. 
But looking back on history, some major social changes came from our greatest challenges.
Women took on various roles during World War I working at factories and as ambulance drivers, farm workers and nurses, and in many countries women’s suffrage followed the war. During World War II, women took on more jobs at home, and more than 350,000 joined the military to repair planes, nurse soldiers, drive trucks and perform clerical work. While men mostly reclaimed their factory jobs once they returned from the war, about a third of women older than 14 worked outside of the home within a few years of the war’s end.
Obviously, gender, racial and other disparities persisted after each of these moments, and in the grand scheme of history, they may have been small steps forward in terms of trying to achieve equality. Still, I would like to see the pandemic as an opportunity to rebuild and fix the inequities it has so clearly exposed. Governments must push for new laws and practices that value level the playing field, rather than only offering assistance.
Hawaii is already leading the way. The state recently proposed what it labeled a “feminist economic recovery plan” that includes publicly funded child care for essential workers, a nearly $25 hourly minimum wage for single mothers, universal basic income and covered co-payments on coronavirus testing and treatment. Hawaii’s plan sets aside an emergency fund for marginalized groups, including undocumented immigrant women, women with disabilities, domestic workers and sex trafficking survivors, and it proposes 20% of coronavirus response funds be pro-rated to help the recovery of indigenous populations. 
Khara Jabola-Carolus, who leads the state’s Commission on the Status of Women, explained the goals of the policy best in an interview with The Lily, an offshoot of The Washington Post.
“Normally, this ‘women’s work’ seems nonessential, but during COVID-19, it’s [society’s] only defense from total collapse,” Jabola-Carolus said. “If we want a sustainable recovery, we need to formally revalue this work, entice men to do it and integrate our economy around it.”
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called this pandemic “the great equalizer,” acting as though it has placed us all in a similar situation. All Americans feel anxious right now but for far-ranging reasons. Nurses, doctors, store clerks, pharmacists, garbage collectors and postal carriers are worried they’ll contract a new and deadly disease and spread it to their loved ones at home, and many who are out of work wonder how they’ll pay bills or find a new job. 
The coronavirus has yet to equalize anything, but hopefully lawmakers will see the dire need for change in a system that devalues its most essential workers and puts its own people at greater risk of falling ill. And for women and other underrepresented groups, who make up a majority of the essential workforce that holds our society together right now, it’s necessary to rethink and rebuild these policies. If Hawaii can create a progressive plan that provides extra support to underrepresented groups during recovery, there’s hope that other states and the whole country could do the same.

As the coronavirus crisis continues and the semester comes to an end, students may be looking at a summer without plans or direction, cooped up in their apartments or their families’ homes. For those continuing school in the fall, this break may seem like a time of uncertainty. Many students had internships canceled for the coming summer, and many others have been forced to leave from their place of work and have moved back home with family. These students may be looking for a way to fill this void with productive avenues for their energy. It would be prudent for students to examine other options to occupy themselves during this summer vacation, be it summer school or finally working on a passion project of their own.
Summer school can help students provide structure and a regular schedule in this tumultuous time. For some, the simple act of having something with a definite start and end time can help those who have trouble managing their mostly empty day. The summer can be a perfect time to take courses to fulfill general education requirements or introductory courses for their major. Students who see a particularly stressful semester on the horizon could also opt to take one of their harder courses over the summer so they can balance their studies. 
If taking a difficult class this summer sounds too stressful or impossible, students could consider taking something simply for their own education or enjoyment. If students are feeling disconnected from their USC community while at home, courses such as  “Los Angeles: The City, the Novel, the Movie” could be useful for those who do not know that much about the city of Los Angeles. While conducting classes over Zoom does make connecting with peers more difficult, students could enroll in courses with friends to provide another avenue through which to connect. 
L.A. City College offers several language classes, including American Sign Language, that it is conducting online for the summer semester. Learning a foreign language could be a nice escape from the current times and provide some useful skills for life after sheltering at home.
These courses do not have to be too expensive either. At $1,928 per unit, costs for taking a four-unit class at USC could be prohibitive for those who have been hard hit by current conditions. But the University offers financial aid over the summer, such as discounted loans or extension of existing scholarships. However, if these options are unavailable or unfeasible for students, L.A. City College and other schools within the L.A. Community College District offer courses at $46 a unit, a much lower price tag than USC. Students who have moved home should also consider looking into their local community colleges, as California tuition for those out-of-state residents is significantly more expensive. Even if the course credit doesn’t transfer back to USC, simply enrolling in a class that aligns with student interests could give them something to do and teach them something about the world around them.
If the prospect of taking even more courses sounds stressful, now could be an opportune time to take up a personal project. These tasks don’t have to be writing the next great novel or starting a podcast, although those who are willing can give those their best shot. Perhaps parents need a new bookshelf or an elderly neighbor needs their lawn weeded or grocery shopping done. In these stressful times, helping those in the community or even checking something off your own personal errand list can help relieve anxiety. All tasks, from the smallest favors to the biggest undertakings, can help provide a sense of purpose or productivity for those who feel trapped at home with little to occupy their time. 
Of course, for some students, productivity by these metrics may be out of reach. For students who are hit hardest  by the pandemic, it may demand all their energy to keep working or take care of sick loved ones or community members. However, these are options for the USC students who have the privilege of time off in relative security during this pandemic and who may be itching for a task to keep them occupied. Those students should consider furthering their education or personal projects in addition to finishing that season of television.

For several months, students and faculty from USC Games, the joint video game design program facilitated by the Viterbi School of Engineering and the School of Cinematic Arts, have been working to create video games to exhibit at the third annual USC Games Expo May 12. Recognized as the world’s largest university-sponsored gaming and esports show, the Expo brings together students, faculty and industry professionals to check out the latest developments in gaming. 
Unlike previous years, the 2020 Expo will not be held on the University Park Campus due to the coronavirus pandemic. Before California issued its stay-at-home order, event organizers decided to shift the event online and stream it on various platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitch. Jim Huntley, an adjunct assistant professor of SCA’s Interactive Media & Games Division who helped organize the event, said they began planning the Expo in February but made plans for an online switch if the situation with the coronavirus worsened.
“[We reacted] very quietly and somberly,” Huntley said. “As things were evolving on the pandemic in other parts of the world, we were talking to each other, going, ‘OK, we have to [make a] parallel path, we have to plan for both the physical Expo, and there might be an online Expo, and it might be a combination of both.’”
Even with the decision to transition the Expo to a virtual format, Danny Bilson, chair of the Interactive Media & Games Division and director of USC Games, said he and the other organizers looked to branch out beyond their campus audience to a general audience with a passion for video games. Organizers of the event originally thought of the possibility of streaming the actual in-person event, and the shift to complete virtual mode gave them the opportunity to experiment with this. 
“What we’ve always known is that everything we’re doing for this is what we wanted to do for phase two of our Expo anyway, which is to get it beyond our walls,” Bilson said. “Hopefully by the time we’re back on campus, we’ll be able to literally share, broadcast in interactive ways through all these streams out from USC physically because we’ll have learned it and tuned it through these socially distanced times.” 
Even with the online adjustment, the major elements of the Expo will remain the same. Namely, the event will feature more than 90 exhibitions displaying tabletop, mobile, PC and console games. USC Games will sponsor this year’s Expo alongside Jam City Games, a Los Angeles-based video game development company.
One of the major focuses of this year’s Expo will be the games created by students participating in the Advanced Games Program, the capstone class that brings them together to work on the production of a major game. Overseen by Viterbi and SCA, AGP gives students the opportunity to use their skills in composition, programming and design to make a game for exhibition. 
Twelve AGP games will be featured at the 2020 USC Games Expo, including “ShortStacked,” a PC game that follows the adventures of two children disguising themselves as an adult using a trench coat to carry out shenanigans such as watching R-rated movies. Christie Xu, a senior majoring in computer science (games), said although she was unsure of the transition of an in-person Expo to a digital event, she looks forward to presenting her team’s work to fellow students, faculty and the average livestream viewer.
“I’m actually really happy because that means the people on my team get a way to showcase their work still,” Xu said. “My goal was to make a good game as a byproduct and make sure
that everyone had a good experience … and making people smile at [the] Expo.”
The coronavirus outbreak resulted in Xu and her team finishing the game remotely, in three different time zones. In fact, one of the external artists on the team worked directly from Taiwan. Despite this, they managed to collaborate online and completed beta testing April 23. 
“I feel like the reason why my project’s still been going smoothly is because of everyone’s individual accountability — showing up to the meetings and the Zoom calls and just holding themselves responsible,” Xu said.
Colin Spiridonov, a freshman majoring in computer science (games), will present his team’s game called “Ghosted: Battle Royale,” a physical card game that adds a competitive feature and implements a theme of high school popularity. Spiridonov and his team completed the game in Fall 2019. 
Because the team’s final product is a physical board game, Spiridonov said the switch from an in-person event to an online one required them to make changes to their game presentation such as switching from interactive play to gameplay footage for the stream. With the game centered around player interaction, Spiridonov and his team planned to have a table and chair set up where people could walk by and play during the original Expo. With the transition to an online event, they made the necessary adjustments to the game’s presentation.
“All we have to show is the gameplay video in the trailer, and then some b-roll video, which is just [an] uncut version of gameplay video,” he said. “So we’ll show that off to whoever wants to see or not. Yeah, it’s not the best, obviously. But it’s the right thing to do, to move [the Expo] online.” 
The USC Games Expo will also hold a scheduled esports tournament, which comprises matches from various universities across Southern California competing in games such as Overwatch, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros and Rocket League. 
“I’m looking forward to seeing the content go live and the viewers and the fans and the students’ reactions to seeing it,” Huntley said. “I’m feeling really excited and positive about seeing everything on the screen come together … because we’ve never done it before.”
Tournaments and video game presentations still make up a large part of the scheduled Expo. However, Huntley and Bilson said the virtual event would be promoted differently with the help of celebrities and volunteers. The list of these individuals will be announced in an upcoming press release.
“We’re getting a lot of people who are willing to help out because they all see how important this is to the program and how important it is to the students,” Huntley said. “It’s been very uplifting seeing the support from [the entertainment industry] and everybody else.” 
Bilson said although the gaming industry has to adjust, it can easily transition because of its digital nature. As people look to video games for recreation and an escape from present uncertainty and isolation, Huntley sees gaming gaining more legitimacy as an art form due to a lack of other events, such as sports. 
“I think the video game industry is going to be more important than it’s ever been in the next few years for its ability to connect people who are separated through play,” Bilson said. “So I think you’re going to see a little bit of a flourishing of creativity around connected games and ways to play and communicate and be together when we can’t.”
