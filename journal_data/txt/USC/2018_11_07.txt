Wallis Annenberg Hall echoed with cheers and applause from students and faculty as the CNN broadcast announced projections and updated polling numbers Tuesday evening. 
Attendees at the Party @ the Polls: Election Night viewing event watched as control of the Senate and the House of Representatives swung between the Democratic and Republican parties. Republicans maintained hold of the Senate, while Democrats gained control of the House. 
In Texas, incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz kept his seat, defeating Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O’Rourke. GOP candidate Rick Scott edged out Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson in a tight race in Florida. 
Democrats gained 26 House seats at the time of publication, including two key Florida districts previously occupied by Republicans. 
“I don’t think a lot of people were expecting in the Senate,” USC College Democrats political director Ben Pearce said. “[The House win] gives us a chance to actually enact progressive legislation [and] bring it to the floor that we didn’t have for the last two years.”
USC Center for the Political Future Director Bob Shrum, who co-hosted the event, said he was surprised by the results in Florida.

“I was not surprised that the Democrats took the House, and I’m not surprised by the 10 percent margin in the generic vote for the House because that’s what our USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll predicted,” he said. 
College Republicans at USC Treasurer Sahil Nandwani said that he was satisfied with the overall election turnout but was slightly disappointed with a few results. 
“Nationally, I’m really happy with what’s going on,” Nandwani said. “The headwinds of history are against us, but Republicans are winning a lot of uphill battles. [California races were] still a nailbiter. We are very disappointed to see Proposition 6 fail.” 
California Proposition 6 advocated for a repeal of the statewide gas tax, which pays for road and infrastructure repairs.  At time of publication, the proposition was rejected. 
The proposition had the support of many Republicans, including California gubernatorial candidate John Cox, who lost the election to Democrat Gavin Newsom. Dianne Feinstein kept her Senate seat. 
California residents voted against Proposition 10, which would repeal the limits on municipal rent control, though the proposition garnered much support from housing advocates in Los Angeles.
Some congressional elections in Southern California districts were not finalized at time of publication. Districts 48 and 49 were projected to turn blue, with 91 and 44 percent of precincts reported, respectively. 
Pearce said that with more Democrats in the House, he expects the Trump administration to be held to more accountability.
“I think we’re going to see a House of Representatives that’s going to start governing the way that the people want it to,” Pearce said. “It’s less of a partisan thing. … Now that the Democrats control the House, there’s going to be a lot more accountability.”
This year’s midterm elections were historic for underrepresented communities in politics. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan is one of two Muslim women in Congress this year, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is the youngest woman to be elected at 29. Colorado also made history by electing Jared Polis, the first openly gay man, as governor.
By time of publication, more than 100 women were projected to win seats in the House, compared to a previous record of 84 seats.
“It has just been old white guys for so long … so it is nice to see more representation that is representing more of the population,” said Sophie Roppe, a freshman majoring in communication. 
Leah Ghavami, a junior majoring in communication, said election results can be attributed to an increase in voter turnout.
“This election had more of an emphasis on voting, which was largely made via social media platforms to encourage youth to have a voice,” Ghavami said.

USG Vice President Blake Ackerman apologized for comments regarding hazing pledges of his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu. (Krystal Gallegos | Daily Trojan)
Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Blake Ackerman was censured at the USG meeting Tuesday after senators received an anonymous email with screenshots tying Ackerman to comments about hazing.
“I … regret that those comments imply that I condone hazing in Greek life, which I absolutely do not,” Ackerman said. “I know that hazing has a negative impact on both individuals and the community as a whole, both in terms of mental health and campus climate, and should not be tolerated on our campus.” 
Following his remarks, the Senate voted to censure Ackerman while it looks into the screenshots included in an anonymous email.
On Friday, USG senators, along with the Daily Trojan, received an email with screenshots of Ackerman’s comments on a post in a Sigma Alpha Mu Facebook group. One screenshot showed comments made by Ackerman in support of a post that suggested giving an instant bid to pledges who have sex in a casket.
“So down for this,” Ackerman wrote.
Another screenshot showed Ackerman standing behind two fully naked brothers on the fraternity’s front lawn. 
“I firmly believe that the process of censuring [Ackerman] is a good first step towards addressing these allegations in a thorough and fair manner,” said Sen. Michaela Murphy, who proposed the censure.
The email states that an SJACS investigation is underway, but Ackerman said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that he has not been notified of an official investigation.
“These screenshots clearly position Blake within close vicinity of an incident of indecent exposure,” the email read. “Blake is within mere feet of two fully nude brothers … on Greek Row in front of the SAM fraternity house, and surely must have been aware that this was occurring at the time.”
With Ackerman censured, Speaker Pro Tempore and Sen. Matt Crane presided over the meeting. 
Sen. Meagan Lane, who said she voted in favor of the censure, explained that as of now no drastic measures will be taken and Ackerman will not be removed from his position. 
“I’m very much in favor of being as fair as possible and getting all of the facts from all parties,” Lane said. “As an elected officer I also intend to look further into the information that we did receive over the weekend because my primary interest is to protect the integrity of our work.”
Senators will discuss the future of Ackerman’s position at following senate meetings. 
CORRECTIONS: This article incorrectly stated that Vice President Blake Ackerman was censured indefinitely. He was only censured for the senate meeting on Nov. 6.
The story also incorrectly stated that Sen. Matt Crane will be presiding over future senate meetings . He only presided over the meeting of Nov. 6.
The story also stated that Ackerman was being investigated by Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards. Ackerman said he was not aware of this investigation and the Daily Trojan could not independently confirm the type of investigation.
The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

The Greek organizations claimed that the University’s decision to defer rush violated Leonard Law. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed a lawsuit Monday filed by five Greek organizations against USC regarding the University’s deferred rush policy. 
The Greek organizations — Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority and Beta Theta Pi, Theta Xi, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Chi fraternities — filed an appeal for the lawsuit, which was expedited last week after request for preliminary injunction was denied by the trial court, according to attorney Alexander Pilmer, who represents the Greek organizations suing the University. 
“Students have first amendment right under the constitution that are fundamental to our country and those first amendment rights cannot be deprived in a situation like this,” Pilmer said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We felt it was important to bring this lawsuit to try to prevent the University from infringing on fundamental first amendment rights.”
However, the University acknowledged the importance of fraternities on campus, but said that the rush process was deferred since it can “impede the success of an incoming freshman already dealing with many transition challenges — both social and academic — during their semester of college academic life.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Thomas Derken, the vice president of communications for the Interfraternal Council, said they are currently evaluating the lawsuit. 
“IFC acknowledges the change and adaptation in recruitment policies,” Derken said. “We are currently in the process of further review regarding the hearing.”
According to the statement, the University has been evaluating the decision to defer rush for two years. The policy announced by vice president of student affairs Ainsley Carry in September 2017 and began being implemented this academic year.
The lawsuit claimed that USC violated the Leonard Law, which prevents private universities from making rules that would violate the First Amendment if enforced at a public university.  
“The Leonard Law extends to private school students, as a matter of discretionary state power, rights that public school students would have under the First Amendment,” David Cruz, a USC professor of law and First Amendment expert, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It prevents penalizing students at private schools in certain ways that would not be allowed in public schools.”
Michael Overing, a First Amendment expert and adjunct professor of Annenberg School for Communication, said that by deferring rush, USC is violating the students’ rights to join organizations on campus. 
“We have a first amendment right to freely associate,” Overing wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “That includes the right to join a fraternity, student groups, clubs … The USC proposed rule runs afoul of that right because it says you have to defer your right of association.”

Junior guard Minyon Moore dribbles in an offensive attack in the Trojans 2018 home opener against UC Riverside. Moore scored 16 points, 12 of which came in the second half, to aid in USC’s 73-55 win. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
An aggressive third quarter spearheaded by junior point guard Minyon Moore helped the Women of Troy defend home court in a season-opening 73-55 victory Tuesday.
A 13-0 run from UC Riverside before halftime led to a 30-30 tie at the half. The Trojans came out of halftime with an attack mindset as they switched to a 1-2-2 full court press and focused more on speeding up the game. 
USC managed to outscore UC Riverside 27-12 in a third quarter that came to define the game; not even a 2-3 zone could contain the flow the Trojans managed to play with in the second half. 
Head coach Mark Trakh credited the game’s momentum swing to the Moore sisters, junior guard Minyon and senior guard Mariya.
“[Minyon] knew, ‘[I’ve] got to turn it up and everybody will turn it up with me,’” Trakh said. “Mariya came out and hit a couple of 3-pointers … and that was the difference.”
Minyon Moore scored 12 of her 16 points in the second half and served as a constant spark on both sides of the ball as she screamed out instructions on defense and looked to push the pace after each of her 12 rebounds. The 2017-18 Pac-12 All-Defensive Team member kicked off the season with a near triple-double, as she posted a stat line of 16 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. 
Despite accompanying a near triple-double effort with a block and three steals, Minyon Moore still believed there was room for improvement. 
“I had a couple of stupid errors that I usually don’t have,” Minyon Moore said. “On defense, it’s a new group so sometimes I tried to help too much.”
One of the key additions in that new group is her older sister Mariya, who transferred from the University of Louisville. After sitting all of last season due to transfer eligibility guidelines, Mariya Moore knocked down three 3-pointers en route to 11 points and five assists in her USC debut. 
“I was just trying to get back into the flow of things,” Mariya Moore said. “It felt good to be back.”
Trakh had a similar reaction to the team’s performance.
“To start how we started and win by 18 points,” Trakh said. “I think we’ve got a lot of potential on the team.”
However, the Trojans start to the season was far from pretty, as they posted nine turnovers in the first half alone. Turnovers paired with anxious play on the defensive end led to a sloppy first 20 minutes of basketball.
At one point in the second quarter, USC mishaps helped UC Riverside go on a 13-0 run and take its only lead of the night. 
However, the constant efforts of the Moore sisters accompanied by solid interior performances from junior forwards Kayla Overbeck and Ja’Tavia Tapley helped keep USC from falling in the team’s season opener to an overmatched UC Riverside team.
Trakh and the Women of Troy suited up Tuesday without senior point guard Aliyah Mazyck. Defensive miscommunications and errant offensive passes were prominent in the senior floor general’s absence. Mazyck was a 2017-18 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year finalist and is expected to bring that same level of production along with her savvy veteran point guard presence when she returns.
“I was happy with the win,” Trakh said. “We won that game tonight without Aliyah and Aliyah’s one of the top players in the Pac-12.”
Next, Trojans will head south to face Long Beach State University Sunday at 2 p.m.

Redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton dribbles down court at Galen Center. Thornton tallied 8 points in the win over Robert Morris. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Shaqquan Aaron planted and took flight, tomahawking the ball with his right hand and flushing it with authority. Before running back on defense, he flexed at his team’s bench and unleashed a mighty roar.
It would be understandable if this was a scream of pent-up frustration. The story for much of USC’s season opener — in front of a crowd of 2,502, the smallest for a season opener since 2006 — was a dysfunctional offense. But Aaron’s dunk, one of two throwdowns for the redshirt senior guard during a solo 9-0 scoring run in the second half, gave the Trojans the spark they needed to pull away from Robert Morris in the Trojans’ 83-62 victory. 
“I just felt like it was time to give my team a boost,” said Aaron, who led the team with 20 points. “It wasn’t just me. We all bought in together and locked down on defense, which led to offense.”
Aaron’s mini-explosion was part of a 21-5 run the Trojans used to take control in the second half. After being unable to receive good looks for much of the first half, USC found its way to the rim over and over again as the second frame progressed. 
Once they had some easy looks at the rim, the ball seemed to move much quicker and their outside shots began to fall; the Trojans had 11 assists in the second half and shot 60.7 percent from the field, including six makes on nine attempts from long range.
But it was striking that they needed a run at all. USC was down 53-49 with just over 12 minutes left, due mostly to a stagnant offense. The team had almost as many turnovers (11) as field goals made (13) in the first half and struggled to make shots at the rim despite their size and talent advantage.
USC’s perimeter players seemed rusty, possibly feeling the effects of many preseason injuries that kept the team from practicing much as a whole. The Trojans fumbled the ball around off the dribble and on passes, allowing Robert Morris to score 9 first-half points off turnovers.
“First game, some of those guys were a little nervous and wanted to prove some things,” head coach Andy Enfield said of the team’s disjointed first half. “They just needed to settle down.”
The Trojan defense wasn’t particularly inspiring, either. Although USC maintained a small lead for most of the half, Robert Morris temporarily took control with a 16-4 run in the middle of the frame. 
The Colonials targeted USC junior forward Nick Rakocevic during this stretch, using USC’s switch-happy defensive scheme to put him into actions that gave his quicker matchup space to shoot or attack off the dribble. Their ball movement also sliced up the press and zone the Trojans occasionally went to.
Rakocevic made his presence known in the second half, however; he began to dominate the interior, grabbing defensive rebounds en route to 16 total boards on the night. His 18 points only trailed Aaron for highest on the team.
“I’ll do that every game if I have to,” Rakocevic said of his work on the glass. “Offensive rebounding has kind of been my thing since freshman year, so I wanted to stick to that.”
The whole team might have needed some time to find its groove. The careless ball-handling, poor shot selection and slow-footed defense of the first half was replaced by energetic ball movement and stifling athleticism in the second.
“We made some adjustments defensively, how we guarded ball screens,” Enfield said. “We finally rebounded the ball, and then we went down and shared the basketball. It’s a fun style to play when you can run, spread the floor and make the extra pass.”
Freshman guard Kevin Porter was also impressive in his debut, totaling 15 points, five rebounds and a number of highlight plays. His alley-oop slam gave the crowd a taste of his game-changing athleticism, and he showcased his shot-making ability with a tough stepback three in the second half, although he picked up a technical for taunting afterward.
“He just needs to [be] more controlled, act like you’ve been there, done that before,” Enfield said.
This USC team clearly has talent. Multiple players stepped up when needed, and senior forward Bennie Boatwright, heralded freshmen guard Elijah Weaver and forward J’Raan Brooks did not play due to injury. But last year’s team was talented, and they disappointed as a top-15 team in the preseason. 
The Trojans need to avoid stagnancy and apathy and play like they did in the second half more consistently, or they will fall below expectations for the second straight year.

The football team looks to regain control of the Pac-12 South division with a win against its in-state rivals Cal following a much-needed win against Oregon state.
The offense focused heavily on its run blocking scheme today, perhaps in anticipation of a heavier workload for the Trojans’ tailbacks. They certainly seem to deserve it, after senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware broke out for a career night last weekend with 205 yards and three touchdowns on 17 carries. Along with sophomore tailback Vavae Malepeai, who picked up 101 yards, and sophomore tailback Stephen Carr’s score, USC’s envisioned three-way ground game finally appears to be coming to fruition, even if a bit later than hoped. Life should get easier for freshman quarterback JT Daniels when opponents have to respect the run as well. But USC will be without Carr, who suffered a high ankle sprain, for the next few weeks.
Helton praised all three running backs for their dominant effort.
“I thought [Malepeai] and [Ware] and [Carr] really ran the ball violently between the tackles,” Helton said. “It was great to get that running game going, have over 300 yards, and yes, it makes play calling so much more easier cause you get the one on one matchups and those are easy reads for a young quarterback.”
Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast commended his unit’s scrappy performance as well.
“We wanted to come in here and stop the run, and they had 41 yards rushing, so that was our main goal to hold them under 75 yards running,” Pendergast said. “Our guys rose up to the occasion … I thought the guys executed the plan for the most part pretty well.”
However, it’s hard to say whether USC’s commanding victory last week was the result of a surprise coaching change that saw Helton assume play calling duties and bring in Tim Drevno to handle the offensive line following the firing of offensive line coach Neil Callaway, or if it had more to do with Oregon State’s talent level. Helton spoke about the adjustments he made prior to the game.
“I’m always harder on myself,” Helton said. “The emphasis going in, I just wanted to get us in a flow, let the kids play with tempo, not try to overthink things … let them play fast.”
Helton also downplayed his own decisions, giving the credit to his players’ execution.
“I though they brought a great attitude, and great effort, and I told them ‘those are the only two things you can control,” Helton said. “I know it’s been a hard week, it’s a tough week, but you’re gonna set the tone.’ And they did.”
Either way, the Trojans are still in the thick of the Pac-12 race, sitting one game behind Utah, the South division leaders. That being said, USC will need to win out the remainder of the year in three straight rivalry games, the first coming against the Bears this weekend. 
Rivalry Weeks
With three-fourths of his freshman season over, Daniels isn’t letting up in the crucial final three weeks that will make or break USC’s season. 
“I’m just so into it right now,” Daniels said. “You’re coming into the home stretch, your body’s tired, your mind’s tired … it’s college football. It’s USC football. It’s a big stage.”
Daniels stressed the importance of film in making sure that he’s ready for the three classic rivalry matchups against Cal, UCLA and No. 3 Notre Dame, while also speaking humbly about his own limitations.
“I’m not as good as someone like Sam Darnold, just to be frank,” Daniels said. “I can’t do what a guy like [Darnold] can do. For me, if I’m going to succeed, I know that I have to be the most prepared to know what’s gonna happen. … I just have to know based off of preparation and film study who’s gonna be where and have to know where I gotta throw the ball.” 
Injury Update
Freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin returned to practice Tuesday. He will continue to be monitored as his shoulder injury heals. 
Sophomore linebacker Levi Jones returned from practice after missing last week with a hip injury.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Fink has resumed his throwing routine as he recovers from three broken ribs. He is not yet cleared for contact.
Junior wide receiver Michael Pittman sat out due to a bone bruise in his shoulder. He is doubtful to play.

Who can beat Alabama? It’s the question on everyone’s mind this college football season — more so than ever after the Tide steamrolled No. 3 LSU Saturday. The answer is probably no one. At least not one of the other 130 teams in the FBS, who adorably keep playing out their schedules as if the season isn’t a foregone conclusion. It’s like when LeBron lets his kids play each other in one-on-one before swatting every one of their shots like it’s the NBA Finals. 
Right now, you may be thinking to yourself, “I am a USC student reading a USC student-run paper. Why should I care about Alabama and their dominant collegiate football team? Where is Alabama?” 
Astute observations, but as USC students, we must all be worried about Alabama for one reason and one reason only: They’re coming. The Trojans play Alabama in the 2020 season opener. I need not remind you of the last time the two programs met, but in the 2016 season opener, Alabama squashed USC 52-6. USC head coach Clay Helton, who has never said a mean word, was seen on the sideline yelling things like “darn,” “oh, goodness” and “oh, shucks.” It was a scary sight. 
It gets worse. Since the Tide keep getting better and better with each passing year, by 2020 they should be legitimate Super Bowl contenders. 
Since we’ve established that no current college team can compete with Alabama, here’s how they’d stack up with teams from the past, the NFL and alternate dimensions (it takes a lot of digging to find teams who can beat Bama). Let’s get started with hope this column gives USC a road map to beating Bama in 2020 (it won’t). 
2004 USC Trojans 
(13-0, National Champions (later vacated)) 
We’ll start here for a couple reasons. The 2004 squad is the most decorated USC football team in recent history. Led by Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Matt Leinart, USC defeated Oklahoma 55-19 to claim the program’s first unanimous national title since 1972. This USC team holds up as a truly dominant group. They led the nation in scoring defense (7.5 points per game allowed) and placed third in scoring offense (46.1 points per game), en route to a 13-0 record — the program’s first undefeated season in a quarter-century. 
But could they hang with the 2018 Crimson Tide? Maybe for a half or so. In 2004, USC won four games by 8 points or fewer. Alabama’s closest game this season was a 22-point drubbing over a ranked Texas A&M. You do the math.
Predicted score: Alabama 40, USC 21 
2001 Miami Hurricanes 
(12-0, National Champions) 
There’s a reason the 2001 Hurricanes are often regarded as the best college football team of all time. 
Not only were the ’01 Hurricanes a truly dominant team — they were also loaded with future NFL stars like wide receiver Andre Johnson, running back Frank Gore, safety Ed Reed and defensive tackle Vince Wilfork. They are one of the few teams in college football history that could’ve kept up with Alabama from a talent perspective. 
The ’01 Hurricanes’ offense, which averaged 43.2 points per game with three future Pro-Bowl running backs, could’ve hung some points on the Tide defense. This year, Alabama is allowing 14.1 points per game. That mark is good for seventh-fewest in the nation, but it isn’t historically ridiculous like most of their other feats (for comparison, Miami allowed 7.2 points per game in 2001). 
With most aspects of this matchup being a wash, it would likely come to down to the quarterbacks. Alabama’s human-missile-crisis sophomore quarterback Tua Tagovailoa holds the second-best passer rating in FBS history. Miami’s quarterback Ken Dorsey sounds like the name of a used car salesman.
Predicted score: Alabama 45, Miami 35 
2018 Buffalo Bills (2-7) 
The Bills are technically not the worst team in the NFL in terms of record (the Raiders and Giants are both 1-7). But I have to believe they’d give Alabama the closest game of any current NFL squad. As an above-average team defensively, the Bills’ three quarterbacks are the three worst judging by passer rating (min. 20 pass attempts). If you put a Swiffer Wet-Jet mop behind center, it may fare better than the trio of quarterbacks Josh Allen, Derek Anderson and Nathan Peterman. Collectively, they’ve thrown over five times as many interceptions (16) as touchdowns. Peterman, the current starter, has been especially impressive in his terribleness, tossing 12 picks and three pick-6’s in just four career starts. 
Meanwhile, Alabama’s defense is tied for seventh in interceptions (13) and first in pick-6’s (four). This would be a gritty victory for the Tide defense, but they’d ultimately win behind seven turnovers.
Predicted score: Alabama 17, Buffalo 6 
2003 Atlanta Falcons 
(Madden Version) 
The 2003 Atlanta Falcons were a very unremarkable team (5-11, missed playoffs), and thus Alabama could have maybe beaten them because they are quite remarkable. However, the video game version of the ’03 Falcons, as featured in Madden NFL 2004, was special for one particular reason. In it, quarterback Michael Vick was and is the most dominant player in video game history. His speed and precision throws traveled at the speed of light. Therefore, Madden-Vick is the closest equivalent we have to real-life Tagovailoa. Plus, they’re both lefties!
If we could somehow transport today’s Alabama team into the video game, we’d witness one of the best quarterback matchups in history. Unfortunately, we just don’t have the technology yet. Bama would still win, though.
Predicted Score: Alabama 156, Virtual Atlanta 153
