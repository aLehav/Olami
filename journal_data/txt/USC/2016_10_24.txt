In the low-lit ballroom of the Radisson Hotel, a stage stood with a lone microphone planted in the center. 
This was the setting for the USC Funny or Die: Jokes for Votes, headlined by producer and director Judd Apatow. The event, which took place on Sunday evening, aimed to “promote voter registration and getting out to vote this November,” according to its Facebook page. 
Jokes for Votes was hosted by Funny or Die, NextGen Climate and the USC Special Events Committee. Apatow and several other comedians, including Ron Funches, Moshe Kasher, Beth Stelling and Taylor Tomlinson, presented comedy segments throughout the evening.
Apatow, who once attended USC, told stories about his experiences in Hollywood as well as some of the lessons he’s learned over the years.
“No one is thinking about you as much as you think they are,” Apatow said about the time he made a joke about David Schwimmer. He convinced himself that the actor hated him for the joke, and went so far as to hide from Schwimmer the entire night at a charity event.
Even though the evening was dedicated to voter registration, few of the remarks were aimed toward the campaign trail. Instead, Apatow’s set included anecdotes about actors Robert De Niro and Mark Ruffalo’s eccentric methods for smiling in photos, as well as a story about an evening with Val Kilmer in which he failed to tell the actor that he had a booger hanging out of his nose “for 45 minutes.”
While most of the evening refrained from talking about the election outright, politics manifested itself in more subtle ways. Kasher, who was named Best New Comic by iTunes in 2009, spent a portion of his set advocating for women by tearing apart the “evils of catcalling.”
“Women have to deal with the strangest things,” Kasher said. “In order to understand what women go through you have to bend your brain. Men don’t fully get it because it doesn’t happen to us, and if it did we would not like it.” 
Kasher referred to a man he encountered in New York who would grunt loudly at women he found attractive. 
“Never in the history of New York City has a woman been flattered by the growl,” Kasher said.
Similarly, Tomlinson discussed how unsafe it can be for a single woman to feel secure when going out on excursions. 
“Being a woman is fun most of the time until you want to go on a walk by yourself,” Tomlinson said. “We have to read all the tricks and trips on Buzzfeed on how not to die. If something bad does happen, society is predisposed to think that somehow it is the woman’s fault.”
The night was not completely void of election humor, as Apatow took the time to personally apologize for Trump’s candidacy. He had written some of the jokes aimed at Trump for the White House Correspondents Dinner.
“Apparently, that was the moment Trump wanted his revenge and decided to run for President,” Apatow said.
Ultimately, the goal of the evening was to encourage voter registration. The comedians urged viewers to register at a booth in the back, or to text the number provided on a flyer at the event to determine if they were registered or not.
Funches argued that while there is always a place for positivity, laughter is needed more than ever in the current social climate.
“I think right now it’s important to be positive and to remember that above all else we are all human and we all want the same things, we all want love, and we all want to be taken care of,” Funches said. “That’s something that’s important to remember.”
Gisella Tan, director of the USC Special Events Committee, said that the evening was one stop in a tour the comedians are doing around schools in California. 
Tan emphasized that comedy was an important tool in reaching young adults who may not want to vote. 
“It’s trying to get students to come out to register to vote,” Tan said. “In order to get students to be more engaged in politics it’s really essential to present the topic in a more easily digestible form. I think comedy is a really good way to do that.”

Panelists spoke to journalism students about the overlap of entertainment and journalism when covering Hollywood and television at Wallis Annenberg Hall on Monday evening. 
The event was hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
The panel featured Danielle Robay, an entertainment journalist, TV host and Pop Politics blogger; Heidi Clements, the executive producer and writer of the ABC Family show Baby Daddy; and Ken Baker, a senior news correspondent for E! News. 
Mary Murphy, a senior lecturer at Annenberg, moderated the event. The panel discussion took place as part of Murphy’s class, “JOUR 381: Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society.”
“When I became a journalist, no one ever said you had to be entertaining. They said you have to be accurate, honest, tell both sides of the story,” Murphy said.
With the development of apps like Instagram and Twitter and outlets like YouTube, being entertaining and creating a brand has become important to a successful career. 
The number of followers a person has elevates their value as an entertainer who need to gather support from fans in order to make a living. 
“When I got into entertainment news, everyone told me you had to find your niche,” Robay, who is currently a host and producer of CBS’s Entertainment Tonight/Entertainment Tonight Online, said.
Robay defined niche as her “why,” the “why” being the reason why she is in entertainment news. 
For Robay, a person needs a reason to work besides money, such as passion for their careers.
Clements encouraged the event attendees to follow their passions and choose what makes them happy over what might make them wealthy. 
“A lot of times you can end up following a certain path because the money is so good and you get stuck in it even if it’s not your passion,” Clements said. “Go be broke.”
The best time for a person to re-evaluate and find what their true career path is, is when they are “stuck” in a job that they are not passionate about, according to Baker. 
Baker previously worked at People Magazine and US Weekly.
“That’s when you define your career, when you’re stuck. What’s going to propel you is your passion,” Baker said.
Baker encouraged the audience to keep trying to break into the entertainment industry and realize that more people in the world are going to say no than yes, which does not signify defeat. 
“What are you meant to do in service to the world? Find your dharma,” Baker said.

Lisa Blaydes, an associate professor of political science at Stanford University, gave a talk about the types of resistance and compliance that took place in Iraq during the regime of Saddam Hussein at the Von Kleinsmid Center on Monday afternoon. The lecture, which was part of a political speaker series, was hosted by the political science department at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Blaydes is also a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and author of the book Elections and Distributive Politics in Mubarak’s Egypt. 
Blaydes pointed out that much of the American viewpoint of Iraq has caused problems for the country, especially in how the American government decides whether or not to intervene and in the way they intervene in Iraqi affairs. Americans see Iraq through the lens in which the mass media has presented it, especially during Hussein’s regime in Iraq during the late 20th and early 21st century, according to Blaydes.  However, not much is known about the violence within the region during that time between the different sectarian groups and Hussein’s regime. 
“We need to understand more about what that regime was like, and I think these documents help us understand more about the violence that followed the U.S. invasion,” Blaydes said in reference to documents obtained from Iraq after the 2003 invasion. 
According to Blaydes, the documents revealed an array of information about Iraq during the late 20th and early 21st century, including political party preference within each region of the country, the number of war martyrs within specific time frames, the names of “distinguished families” within each region and the number of sons they had lost during the Iraq-Iran war. 
The conventional narrative that has been promoted by the media cannot be assumed about sectarianism within Iraq, Blaydes said. She explained how the sources of those sectarian identities are very much a function of the experience of Iraqis under authoritarianism. Furthermore, she pointed out that there are a lot of assumptions made about the nature of sectarian identity as being more important than any other identity in Middle Eastern societies. 
Morris Levy, an assistant professor of political science at USC, coordinated the speaker event. 
“It would benefit USC students to attend these lecture series, as they cover topics that classes don’t usually get to talk about and let people know what’s going on in other places of the world,” Levy said.

This week, USC students will have the opportunity to join the efforts to end homelessness in Los Angeles. A collaboration between the USC Interfaith Council, Office of Religious Life, Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and Price School of Public Policy, USC’s Homelessness Awareness Week provides a variety of events where students can learn about how to get involved in ending homelessness.
The events include information tables around campus, a march from the Office of Religious Life to Tommy Trojan, a movie screening, a walking tour of Skid Row, a rally and panels featuring various guest speakers.
“The goal of this week is to make students and the USC community aware of the seriousness of the problem of homelessness in Los Angeles, and also to discover where to be involved in solving the problem through charity and political action,” said Reverend Jim Burklo, associate dean of Religious Life.
In addition to learning about how to get involved through charity, students can also register to vote and learn more about Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion Los Angeles Bond campaign to build housing for homeless people.
“The timing is perfect because Nov. 8 is coming very soon, and it’s a time to inform the public about the issue,” Burklo said.
For those interested in volunteering to help stop homelessness, organizations and agencies such as PATH, NAMI, A Community of Friends, Nourished, LA Voice and Share a Meal will be on campus throughout the week.
Jack Lahey, a USC alumnus who earned his master’s degree in social work, is now the Project Assistant and Project Coordinator for two different homelessness-related research projects. Lahey said that part of his position is funded by the Grand Challenge to End Homelessness, a nationwide initiative by the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare. He emphasized that he was one of the only staff members planning the event, and that it was mostly student-run.
“It’s almost all students,” Lahey said. “I think that’s really important, because the administration is supportive of it, but the students are in leadership.” 
Jaclyn Nguyen, a senior majoring in Spanish and human biology, helped organize Homelessness Awareness Week.
“I knew I wanted to be a part of it,” Nguyen said. “It’s important to demonstrate that USC is supporting the city in battling homelessness. I am just astounded at how much support and enthusiasm we have gotten from different groups throughout the past weeks.”   
Lahey also helped start Nourished, a program that allows students to cook healthy and affordable meals for the homeless population of Los Angeles.
“A lot of times when people talk about solutions to homelessness. It’s very monolithic; we think housing will fix it or we think jobs will fix it. Homelessness is a multifaceted issue,” Lahey said. “I think the first step in successfully understanding [homelessness] is education. You have to understand what the causes of homelessness are and what happens when someone is homeless.” 
For Burklo, the work the students have done to make Homelessness Awareness Week a reality was impressive.
“There is tremendous student interest in this,” Burklo said. “It’s pretty impressive how all these groups have come together to stand for working against homelessness.” 
The team is trying to plan another Homelessness Awareness Week, which is currently set to take place in January, according to Lahey.
“This is just the beginning of the dialogue,” Lahey said.

The No. 2 USC women’s golf team has been aiming to play out the adage, “quality, not quantity” during competition this week. 
Despite sending only three golfers — which is not enough to qualify as a complete team — to the Nanea Pac-12 Preview this week, USC has strung together several competitive, yet unsteady individual performances. 
Through the first two rounds of the competition — both of which were played on Tuesday — sophomore Robyn Ree is currently tied for the lead (-3) as an individual in a field of 64 golfers. 
“She seems to have a really good knowledge of her own game and her yardages, so she makes some really good decisions out there,” said USC head coach Andrea Gaston on Ree’s performance. “Given the fact that we had completely different weather conditions in the afternoon — almost completely different from the [first round] in the morning — she was able to make some good adjustments.”
After shooting 3-under in the opening round of play, Ree returned in the second round to shoot even at par. Ree is currently tied with Oregon sophomore Kathleen Scavo (-3) and Arizona freshman Gigi Stoll (-3) entering Wednesday’s final day of play. 
“I’m definitely really proud of myself and what I was able to do today, especially with different circumstances, like winds and the tough course conditions,” said Ree regarding her performance Tuesday. “[Today’s performance] definitely helps a lot. I was struggling early on in the season, but knowing that I’m playing well now towards the end of the fall definitely helps me look onto the spring season.”
In addition to having Ree as a frontrunner in Hawaii on Tuesday, freshman Alison Corpuz is tied for 13th overall with a score of 3-over through the first 36 holes. 
Corpuz shot 3-under in the first round and found herself in the top five at that point in the standings. But after shooting 6-over in the second round, Corpuz fell nine spots in the player leaderboards. 
The third and final USC golfer competing at Nanea Golf Club this week is senior Elizabeth Doty. After shooting 6-over in both the first and second rounds Tuesday, Doty (+12) is tied for 43rd overall.

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the NFL is flooded with a lot of pink, from cleats to towels to gloves to the cheerleaders’ pom poms. Even the breast cancer ribbon is painted on the field underneath the NFL logo. As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, these are all things that I like to see. Breast cancer awareness is something that my family and I take seriously. It’s something that I advocate for and support whenever I can, whether it’s something small like the pink ribbon on the side of my high school class ring or something big like attending the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure in Costa Mesa every year since first grade when my mom was diagnosed. 
For the NFL, this is a great cause to support. One in eight women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in their lifetime. In the United States, the death rate for breast cancer is higher than any other cancer except for lung cancer, and it’s the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women besides skin cancer. 
But, beneath the pink infusion and breast cancer awareness campaigns coming from the NFL, there’s another problem that lies beneath: domestic violence. 
October is also domestic violence awareness month. One in three women will have suffered some form of physical violence from their partner in their lifetime. Yet, there is no infusion of purple — the color of Domestic Violence Awareness month — anywhere for the NFL. Maybe they see it as a good thing; purple is an easy enough color to hide. It’s dark like the shadows where the NFL likes to brush off reports of domestic assault committed by their players. 
I’m sure no one has forgotten the blatant mishandling of the Ray Rice case by the NFL. Rice was originally suspended for two games and then he was indefinitely suspended following public outcry over his limited suspension. Commissioner Roger Goodell then changed the suspension to six games for players that committed assault on their spouse or partner. 
I was fortunate enough to get to read the court documents surrounding Rice’s case for my pre-law writing class. Even with a basic understanding of the law early on in the semester, it was easy to see the inconsistencies and lack of organization from Goodell and others from the NFL that allowed for Rice to overturn his suspension. The league’s failure to consistently discipline its players played a role in Rice’s decision being overturned. The issue was whether or not Rice misled Goodell in the original disciplinary hearings. The notes taken during the meetings served as primary evidence in the appeals process. Notes by Goodell and others from the NFL were not very detailed and they didn’t contain any direct quotes. On the other hand, the NFL Player’s Association’s attorney, there on behalf of Rice, had detailed notes with verbatim quotes from Rice. Because of the poor note-taking and lack of organization and control from the NFL, Rice’s suspension was overturned. 
So, Rice was allowed to return to play in the NFL — though no team has signed him — and Goodell was left with his new policy of a six-game suspension for players that committed domestic violence. 
Knowing that the rule has been changed, one would assume that any NFL player found of committed domestic violence would be suspended for six games, right? Wrong. 
Enter Josh Brown. The Giants kicker was suspended for one game in August for violating the NFL’s player conduct policy, a policy that can fluctuate. It can be adjusted according to what the NFL refers to as mitigating circumstances, which can shorten the suspension. Merely three out of 10 players who could’ve been handed the full six-game suspension since Goodell changed the policy have actually received the full suspension. Usually because of mitigating circumstances, the suspensions are reduced. 
Last week, Brown’s letters, emails and a journal — evidence from a May 2015 arrest — were released in which Brown admitted to assaulting his wife. After this information was made known, Brown was put on the commissioner’s “exempt list,” meaning he cannot attend Giants practices or games, but can attend Giants meetings and workouts. He’s also continuing to get paid by the Giants despite not being included on the 53-man roster. 
It’s not clear if New York was aware of the evidence that Brown admitted domestic violence, but the Giants said that they knew about abuse when he signed a two-year $4 million contract last April. 
Goodell’s defense for the NFL’s actions so far with Brown is nothing new. He first said that it’s “difficult for them to understand” the complexities, and that it’s all “a lot deeper and a lot more complicated than it appears.”
As the mess with Brown continued to develop and more incriminating information was released, Goodell defended the NFL’s one-game suspension because when they asked law enforcement for more information, it wasn’t released to them and they “weren’t able to get access to it.” For a league with as much power as influence as the NFL, this seems like a faulty excuse. It sounds all too similar to the NFL claiming they weren’t able to get the elevator video footage of Rice, while TMZ was able to get its hands on it. 
Goodell’s inconsistency and weak stance on domestic violence and players’ punishment are part of the reason Greg Hardy, who was convicted for domestic violence against his former girlfriend, had his original suspension of 10 games reduced to four games. 
This isn’t just a Goodell or NFL front office problem; it runs league-wide. A number of teams have been criticized for drafting or resigning players who have been involved in disputes or misdemeanor charges of domestic violence. 
 “We are looking forward to the start of the season and having Greg be a part of the team,” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said after Hardy’s suspension was reduced.
In short, the NFL has a problem on its hands. It’s been a problem for a number of years now. The inconsistencies and lack of organization for a league that’s so powerful and well-known throughout the United States should really have better measures in place for dealing with their players. Instead, it seems Goodell is more worried about keeping video highlights and GIFs of plays off of social media (even official team accounts) because he’s worried that it’s affecting television ratings. 
Goodell’s policy change has yet to produce substantive results; therefore, it could be argued that the policy was just the result of public outcry against the league’s decisions. It can be said that the policy was never enacted to actually produce change, just created to appease the public and not actually change how the NFL approaches or handles domestic violence with its players. If the NFL doesn’t get its problems under control, leadership changes need to be made. 
It won’t matter if every October athletes don pink accessories promoting breast cancer awareness because the league, through its policies and actions of the commissioner, doesn’t actually care about or respect the well-being of women.

Redshirt senior defensive end Jabari Ruffin has been suspended indefinitely for a student conduct issue, head coach Clay Helton announced on Sunday.
On Monday, his name was taken off USC’s football roster on its website. Ruffin is the third football player to be removed from the team this season after Osa Masina and Don Hill were disciplined in September for their alleged participation in a sexual assault incident.
Helton told the media on Sunday that Ruffin’s status was ambivalent. 
“I don’t have a crystal ball on when or if he could return,” he said.
A backup linebacker, Ruffin has made one career start in four seasons at USC. He has appeared in six games this season — including in Saturday’s win at Arizona — and recorded two tackles. 
He primarily played on special teams and on defense backed up junior Uchenna Nwosu at linebacker. On the depth chart, junior Olajuwon Tucker will take the place of Ruffin. 
Ruffin was suspended for the first half of the Utah State game earlier this season after he stomped on an opponent’s groin in the season opener against Alabama. He also had to write a letter of apology.
In a statement after the September incident, Helton said there would be “zero tolerance” for Ruffin in the future. 
“Jabari is a good kid who made a poor emotional decision,” Helton said at the time. “I am sorry as the head coach, [and] he is also. I know that it will not happen again.”

USC football took to Howard Jones Field on Monday afternoon for the team’s penultimate practice before Thursday’s game versus Cal. Coming off of a bye week, the Trojans will host the Golden Bears in a midweek matchup, hoping to contain their opponent’s high-octane offense.
The Stretch Run
USC has five games remaining in the regular season, and the team sits just one game out of first place in the Pac-12 South with a 3-2 conference record (first-place Utah and Colorado are tied at 4-1). After what many labeled a disastrous start in August, the Trojans have life.
Head coach Clay Helton compared the program’s current situation to the 2015 season, when USC rebounded from a 3-3 start to take the division and came agonizingly close to a Rose Bowl berth. Helton said a game-by-game mentality was key to last year’s comeback, and the head coach was determined to repeat the feat through a similar approach in 2016.
“We haven’t looked ahead, and we’ve just been focusing on this game and this game only,” he said.
Helton also emphasized the need for the squad to stay even-keel even as it gained momentum.
“Stay the course: I haven’t gotten too high or too low as a coach and neither has our coaching staff,” he said. “We’ve just kept grinding. Add up all the wins at the end, and we’ll see where we’re at.”
Having said that, the Trojans aren’t lacking in confidence. With two weeks of prep leading into Thursday’s game, senior linebacker Quinton Powell wasn’t interested in making excuses.
“At this point, every game should be won based off our preparation and things we’ve been watching on film,” he said. “We should win out. It doesn’t matter what the other teams are doing as long as we’re winning.”
Bear Hunt
USC has had an extended chance to study Cal quarterback Davis Webb, and the Trojan defense is prepared, but wary of the senior transfer’s big-play ability.
“He throws the ball very well,” junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said. “They compare him to Jared Goff — that’s what our coaches tell us.”
Indeed, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast was impressed by Webb’s well-rounded game when scouting the Golden Bears’ signal caller.
“He can make all the throws, he’s got really good vision, knows where all his receivers are at all times, and has a really good feel for protections,” Pendergast said. “He’s very impressive.”
Pendergast conceded that Webb would beat the Trojan defense on occasion but stressed that avoiding the big play was paramount. Helton agreed.
“Our [defensive backs] are going to have to do a great job of playing the football because there aren’t going to be too many missed throws or overthrows with this guy,” Helton said. “He’s an elite talent, so we’ve got to play the deep ball really, really well.”
Facing an aerial threat like Webb, senior linebacker Michael Hutchings was glad to have an extra week to get ready.
“They just set an NCAA record for plays in a game, so when you’re dealing with an explosive team like that — a quarterback like that — it’s something you have to be ahead on,” he said.
But in terms of specific strategies to contain Webb, the Trojans were happy to stay mum.
“You’ll find out on Thursday,” Pendergast said, smiling.
If there was one clue, it came from Helton.
“The biggest thing for us, with any good quarterback, is to get him off his spot, whether it’s through a three-man rush, four-man rush, or pressure situations,” he said. “We’ve got to be able to move this quarterback.”
Injury Updates
Redshirt sophomore Ajene Harris and senior Leon McQuay III returned to practice on Monday, and Helton said both were expected to play on Thursday. Senior tailback Justin Davis remained out with a high ankle sprain and is looking less likely to see the field against Cal.

The beautiful, emphatic sounds of the semitic language, along with the eye-catching spectacle of the black- and-white checkered patterned Arab scarves, known as the keffiyeh and the whispers of awe in the air about the Q & A with that incredible Lebanese director are each the instruments of excitement that has built up this event — the 20th-annual Arab Film Festival, which premiered at the Harmony Gold Preview House in Hollywood this past weekend.
There is no one archetypal attendee of this festival — more often than not, one would expect for this to be a reconvening of the sizable Angeleno Arab community. However, it is more than the culture that bonds these audience members, but rather, the passion and interests of a people, both Arab and non-Arab alike, that draw them to this annual festival. Men and women of all ages and backgrounds mingled in the foyer of of the Harmony Gold Preview House, debating and discussing the various topics of the film. “Why did Gamal Abdel Nasser’s dream of Pan-Arabism fail?” “Why do Westerners politicize the veil?” “Will the situation in Gaza ever improve?” were all questions asked in discussion at the event, and the answers of which only expanded after the screening of the films.
This year, in particular, offers an impressive array of films. The Arab Film Festival screened four official entries for the 2017 Academy Awards, its first animation program and 40 percent of the films were directed by Arab women — the highest percentage since the festival’s birth. With the opening night being on Friday, the festival’s debut film was Lebanon’s submission to the Oscar’s, Very Big Shot. 
Though it is easy to assume, with all the turmoil in the region, that the Arab Film Festival’s selections would pertain around the theme of war, this is not quite the case. There are films, like After Spring, which is based off of the Syrian refugee crisis Degrade, which is set in a salon in the blockaded Gaza Strip and 3000 Nights, which follows the story of a Palestinian woman falsely accused of a crime and living in an Israeli prison, that allows for the audience to view those very real situations in the Middle East, however, there are films with themes as universal as coming of age, which was a huge theme in Temporary | Namour, which tells the story of a 20-something Arab-American who feels stuck in his life, who, with his job as a valet-employee, is paid to be in someone else’s intimate space, also defying class-lines. The feelings of being love and in lost left the audience with an eerie sense of vulnerability— which is a feeling all way too familiar. 
The strong emotions, though felt, did not usurp the feeling of the night. And despite the deep discussions, both unique to the Arab world and general to the human emotion alike, through pain, comes laughter, and the laughter was abundant throughout the Arab Film Festival. It will be exciting to see the fate of the films submitted to the Oscar’s and to observe the growth of various directors in their upcoming works and years.

During my senior year of high school, I found a box of CDs that my dad kept in the basement. 
Some were good, some were bad, and some were so bad I felt embarrassed for him. A few of them caught my eye, however, and I appropriated them for my own personal collection to listen to at a later time. 
When the end of October came around, I popped in one of those CDs in particular to see what all the fuss surrounding the album was about. This was when I truly understood why Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of all time, and why The Marshall Mathers LP is his magnum opus.
This album showed me how much of a musical genius Eminem is. He manages to master everything that made him popular on his last outing and condense it into an album that doesn’t drag on for too long, making sure that almost every line is quotable and every song is memorable. 
His internal rhyme scheme has never been stronger in an album. My jaw still drops when I hear his verses on “Remember Me” and “Kill You.” The way he’s able to stuff one bar with multiple rhymes like a Thanksgiving turkey is mindblowing, and I don’t think anyone will be able to recreate his technique on a level like this ever again.
My jaw also drops when I hear some of the things he says on some of these songs. Even at 20, when I pay my own bills, fill out tax forms and am considered an adult in the eyes of the law, I still feel like I have to hide this album from my parents. I thought the last album could get dark at times, but this album is on a whole new level. 
Domestic abuse, school shootings, drug abuse and things I can’t even mention in a school newspaper are all slight work for Slim on this album — hell, all of these sensitive topics make an appearance in one song. Yet, like he did on his previous album, he somehow finds a way to make all of these things and even more despicable acts and crimes sound ludicrously funny, which forces you to take a step back and think about what you’re laughing at. His dark wit is a large part of what makes this album so successful. I still find myself laughing at random times when I’m reminded of some of his funniest quips from this album.
While he brings the laughs, he also shows his more serious side on a couple of songs. “Stan” immediately comes to mind. If you have never heard this track, I honestly urge you to listen to it at your earliest convenience. It’s haunting, but it’s tragically beautiful, and it’s one track out of many that shows that Eminem’s storytelling skills are on par with his rapping skills. Another serious song, “The Way I Am,” is Eminem giving an honest look into how frustrating his newfound fame is, showing that while it got him millions of fans, it also got him just as many, if not twice as many critics.
However, being true to his nature, Eminem couldn’t give any less of a damn about what a critic could think, and it’s one of the main points he stresses throughout the album. Part of the reason I love this album so much is because of how cheeky he is over its entirety. Every line that could be seen as offensive is a wink to the average conservative parent or religious nut daring them to go up in arms against his speech. One of my favorite jokes about this is in “Who Knew” when he asks: “You want me to watch my mouth? How? / Take my f-ckin’ eyeballs out and turn them around?” If the average American was offended by The Slim Shady LP, this album probably gave them an aneurysm.
For starters, this album gave me quality listening material for the rest of the year. The CD didn’t leave my car until I had to turn it in when the lease was up. I listened to this album at least once a month the whole way through for my entire senior year.
This, like some of those albums I’ve written about, have been synonymous with home for me. And when I moved away from college, Eminem’s hit forced me to remember that I’d be leaving Detroit in a couple of months for somewhere as unfamiliar and new like Los Angeles. 
It also finally clicked as to why Michiganders have two holy trinities: the father, the son and the holy ghost and Eminem, Marshall Mathers and Slim Shady. I often have memories of when Detroit was the murder capital of the nation and how people who weren’t from Detroit saw it as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. 
What Eminem helped to do with an album as commercially and critically successful as this was give the city a voice. He showed that you don’t have to grow up in the slums of the Bronx or Compton to have a story to tell, since the Mitten state is full of prideful people who know how great their state is. 
Even with his humble beginnings in Michigan, he was able to make something of his life, and that gives hope to Michiganders everywhere. With this album, he told everyone who overlooked Michigan as a flyover state exactly where they could stick their pretentious attitude.

Try 8 times a day for a year, then daily for a few years and then at least once a month for the years since. 
Nice to read someone discovering a passion for Em through MMLP still today. 
But if it was your dads why do you need to hide it from your parents lol
Wow, good question…lol

Get ready to find humor in things that are no laughing matter. 
In a rocky political climate, when connotations of political correctness are rapidly changing, what role does comedy play? Comedians, filmmakers and actors will gather on campus from Oct. 28 to Oct. 30 at USC School of Cinematic Arts’ third Comedy Festival.
In a series of screenings, panels and seminars spread out across three days, comedy experts will cover topics such as women in comedy, racial diversity, political comedy and social media’s role in distribution of content. Additionally, programs will feature films created by students in SCA’s recently established comedy program. 
Several big influences in the industry are expected to speak and attend the event, which has steadily gained recognition and popularity since its conception. Judd Apatow, director and producer of several comedy films such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up will host a talk on “How to Earn Thousands Making Comedy.” Other industry professionals include Paul Fieg, director of Bridesmaids; Issa Rae, lead actress of The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl; and Ned Fulmer of Buzzfeed. 
Zach Galifianakis and Emmy Award-winning screenwriter Diane English will lead a panel discussion about political comedy, an aptly timed discussion on the eve of one of the most controversial elections in American history. With the emergence of political satire as a legitimate news source, comedians discuss what happens when “TV comedy delivers serious political discussion while presidential debates turn laughable.” Artists will discuss the implications of integrating humor into the political process. 
The rise of female comedians and women using comedy to share their narratives and further feminism will be explored in a panel titled “Women In Comedy — Stars of Their Own Story.” The immense success of comedians such as Amy Schumer, Tina Fey and Mindy Kaling have continued to create a permanent place for strong, confident and funny women in comedy. 
The idea that women have unique and humorous narratives to tell is still a unique one to most, but has become more normalized with the rising popularity of female-driven comedies such as Ghostbusters, Bad Moms and Trainwreck. Women’s role in comedy will be explored by stand-up comedian Maria Bamford, producer Suzanne Todd and other socially conscious, feminist comedians. 
USC’s SCA Comedy Festival is part of a movement to legitimize comedy and build up its presence in academia. USC’s comedy program is the first of its kind, attempting to unravel the idea that comedy cannot be taught. Comedy, like all other kinds of film, is based equally on talent and expertise. Founded in 2010, the program “offers instruction in the writing, directing, production as well as the history and theory of comedy.” SCA’s Comedy program has given students interested in pursuing this rapidly evolving field, a strong foundation. 
Comedy Festival is a combination of efforts from the School of Cinematic Arts and USC’s Vision and Voices initiative.
The event is free and open to the public, but reservation is required.

The team at Swedish game developer EA DICE took a big gamble by taking their flagship Battlefield series 100 years back in time with the release of the game Battlefield 1. Fortunately, this risk has largely paid off. 
Similar to other mainstream first person shooters, Battlefield slowly came to embrace modern warfare starting with Battlefield 2. After the initial excitement surrounding modern combat in Battlefield games died out, the franchise began to feel stale. While its rival series Call of Duty opted to go further into the future of warfare, Battlefield needed to reinvent itself. 
Battlefield 1 does exactly that by taking the series where it hasn’t been. In doing so, it completely reinvents the tone of the series while still retaining the familiar formula of large-scale, objective-based combat.
The multiplayer concept has and always will be the bread and butter of first-person shooters. After the initial release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, single-player campaigns have largely been an afterthought. This is especially true in the Battlefield series,  where the quality of such experiences has diminished considerably in recent years. 
Rather than stick to telling the story of one person at one specific time in one specific place, Battlefield 1 opts to showcase multiple characters in different areas across different periods of time. These vignette-style stories allow players to experience a wide range of geographical locations, but most importantly allow for the telling of human-based stories. 
These missions also serve as a primer for many of the mechanics and modes found in the multiplayer. It’s a unique approach that allows for players to not only experience an amazing set of stories, but to also prepare themselves for the frantic experience that comes after the credits roll. It’s a shame, however, that the campaign isn’t very long. 
Fortunately, in comes the multiplayer option. Whereas Battlefield 4 suffered from the fatigue of sameness regarding its weapons, Battlefield 1 triumphs in its old-school feel. The massive collection of weapons, from rifles to carbines, are all unique and varied. Most importantly, the weapons are customizable in ways that truly matter. 
There are no thermal sights or recoil-reducing attachments to be found in the multiplayer mode, which means players cannot tailor each weapon to their exact specifications. This in turn forces players to experiment with each weapon and what little attachments are made available in order to create the best possible load out. It’s a hard trade-off at first, but is most certainly worth it. 
Adding to the collection of weaponry is the addition of World War I-era vehicles. From bi-planes to horses to early renditions of the modern Abrams tanks, there is no shortage of vehicles at players’ disposal. Each vehicle behaves in a unique way and, depending on the circumstance, can completely change the tide of the game. 
The addition of a new game mode in the form of Operations helps bring the multiplayer full circle. It’s a mishmash between the scale of Conquest and the combat of Rush. Two teams clash on an open map for dominance of the entire area. 
The game mode is designed with the trench warfare of World War I in mind with all the players meeting in the middle hoping to gain control over a certain area. Added cutscenes place the game mode in the context of World War I and add a historical element. It’s an interesting game mode, however, whether it has the capability to overtake the immensely popular Conquest mode remains a big question. 
Unfortunately, while the new multiplayer additions are solid, the same cannot be said for all the maps. Though most of the maps are generally well designed, some of them feel rather boring. But the addition of dynamic weather, coupled with destruction and vehicles, help make these mediocre maps a bit more bearable. 
While the lack of compelling maps isn’t a deal breaker, it would have been nice to have a few more memorable maps that capture the intensity, grit and horror of World War I that the game is able to masterfully portray in its campaign mode. 
Small annoyances aside, Battlefield 1 is a risk that paid off. To say Battlefield 1 is a good game would be an understatement. EA DICE truly outdid themselves with their rendition of World War I. From amazing visuals to a poignant tone and everything in between, Battlefield 1 is truly an excellent game. 
The addition of new game modes and mechanics all help turn what was becoming a stale series into the bonafide leader of first person shooters. It is, quite possibly, the most complete Battlefield game to date.

Upon turning 30 yesterday, Drake decided to surprise his fans by uploading four new songs under the playlist “More Life” Sunday night during his Apple Music OVO Radio Show. The rapper, who will release more songs under “More Life” this December, refrained from dropping the entire album right away to create a more intimate connection with his listeners.
“I’m off like mixtapes,” Drake said during the radio show. “I want to do a playlist. I want to give you a collection of songs that become the soundtrack to your life.”
The playlist channels Drake’s frustration through lyrical jabs at those who have labeled him dishonorable and insincere. While leaving his 20s behind, he enters his 30s with pent-up anger to release through the one way he knows best — music. Coming down from the high of his recent album Views left him, Drake uses “More Life” to speak to the onslaught of controversies he currently faces in his career as he continues to top the charts.
The playlist project’s cover of the man wearing a suit and smoking a pipe with a pen and paper in hand indicates Drake’s philosophical mindset while writing these songs. His manifesto of his personal, disputable fame bwlasts those exploiting his reputation through the song “Fake Love.” The catchy screams of the chorus emulate the artist’s public anger toward people who have used him, while “Two Birds One Stone” has a specific target in mind. 
The notorious song highlights Drake’s ongoing feud with Kid Cudi, a fellow rapper who paused his music career earlier this month to seek treatment for his mental health. He calls Cudi out after he blasted Drake and Kanye West on Twitter last month for being fake rappers by singing, “You were the Man on the Moon / Now you go through your phases / Life of the angry and the famous.” Fans expressed disappointment toward Drake yet continued to show overwhelming support to Cudi on Twitter using #YouGoodMan. 
Despite suffering defamation from his fan base, the Views singer gives rise to the fame of Atlanta rapper 21 Savage and U.K. rapper Santan Dave in songs “Sneakin’” and “Wanna Know” respectively. The eerie introduction to “Sneakin’” leads into the tension both rappers feel when artists become possessed by perfection at the height of their careers. 
As for the fourth song on the playlist, HotNewHipHop reported that Drake’s partnership with Skepta and BBK has turned the rapper into a frequent London visitor. The city’s 17-year-old sensation Dave caught the rapper’s eye, leading to his song “Wanna Know” being remixed by Drizzy on “More Life.” Critics wonder whether the song will blow up like Drake’s past remixes, yet realize that it has already awarded Dave with his approximately three minutes of fame.
Drake’s latest project proves that he is not leaving behind a run-of-the-mill message to his listeners. Throughout his 10 years in the rap game, he has conquered feats and risen to the top, but his static, elevated position does not have much more to offer him. He is left with “weariness and bitterness” catalyzed by underhanded social media posts and blatant offenses toward his creativity, according to Billboard. With “More Life,” Drake hopes to take on the new decade of his life with new music for his fans to turn into their personal soundtracks.

His manifesto of his personal, disputable fame bwlasts those exploiting his reputation through the song “Fake Love.” The catchy screams of the chorus emulate the artist’s public anger toward people who have used him, while “Two Birds One Stone” has a specific target in mind. 
The notorious song highlights Drake’s ongoing feud with Kid Cudi, a fellow rapper who paused his music career earlier this month to seek treatment for his mental health. He calls Cudi out after he blasted Drake and Kanye West on Twitter last month for being fake rappers by singing, “You were the Man on the Moon / Now you go through your phases / Life of the angry and the famous.” Fans expressed disappointment toward Drake yet continued to show overwhelming support to Cudi on Twitter using #YouGoodMan. 
Despite suffering defamation from his fan base, the Views singer gives rise to the fame of Atlanta rapper 21 Savage and U.K. rapper Santan Dave in songs “Sneakin’” and “Wanna Know” respectively. The eerie introduction to “Sneakin’” leads into the tension both rappers feel when artists become possessed by perfection at the height of their careers. 
As for the fourth song on the playlist, HotNewHipHop reported that Drake’s partnership with Skepta and BBK has turned the rapper into a frequent London visitor. The city’s 17-year-old sensation Dave caught the rapper’s eye, leading to his song “Wanna Know” being remixed by Drizzy on “More Life.” Critics wonder whether the song will blow up like Drake’s past remixes, yet realize that it has already awarded Dave with his approximately three minutes of fame.
Drake’s latest project proves that he is not leaving behind a run-of-the-mill message to his listeners. Throughout his 10 years in the rap game, he has conquered feats and risen to the top, but his static, elevated position does not have much more to offer him. He is left with “weariness and bitterness” catalyzed by underhanded social media posts and blatant offenses toward his creativity, according to Billboard. With “More Life,” Drake hopes to take on the new decade of his life with new music for his fans to turn into their personal soundtracks.

“Do you want to bike across California with me this summer?”
I don’t think my friend Jake expected me to say “yes” when he asked me this question midway through my final year of high school. I didn’t expect myself to say “yes” either…I didn’t own a bike, I didn’t know the first thing about changing a tire, and I had never planned a trip on my own before. But as the summer drew closer, I couldn’t shake the feeling that sometimes you have to do things that surprise and scare you in order to make the best memories and learn the most about yourself. So I said “yes.”
As soon as I graduated, I began the frenzied trip-planning process. Jake and I put a lot of effort into preparations, yet it felt like I was planning a trip for someone else — a trip I would never actually go on myself. But soon enough, it came time to fly to San Francisco!
Martina Erdstein | Daily Trojan
We landed in San Francisco, and my predominant feelings were ones of excitement, awe, and a bit of anxiety. I couldn’t believe we were actually doing this! Before we could begin our trek across the Pacific Coast Highway, I knew we had to get some things done. After settling into our hostel in downtown San Francisco, Jake and I went to run all of our errands, and we walked around the city and talked about accomplishment. We discussed how, even if you have to struggle to achieve a goal, the pride that you get when you accomplish something that you had to fight for is one of the best feelings in the world. That feeling is what we were chasing.
After our first day in San Francisco, we began our 500-mile bike ride along the PCH. It took us a couple of days, but we eventually got into a routine: Wake up early, pack our stuff, eat some Cliff bars, hop on our bikes, conquer the road ahead of us, arrive at a new campsite, set up our tents, explore, make and eat enough food to feed a small village, hang out, chat, go to bed, repeat.
Martina Erdstein | Daily Trojan
Each day was similar, but in a way, every single day was completely unique because of how incredibly diverse the California coast is. Some days, we biked through strawberry and artichoke fields, where we could see nothing but farmers doing backbreaking work for miles on end. The smell of strawberries was so strong and sweet that it felt like we were biking through a cloud of fruit. On other days, we spent most of our miles in the forest, surrounded by tall trees and winding roads. Sometimes, we would be biking along the coast and would have nothing but views of the turquoise waves crashing into the grassy mountains surrounding us. Other times, we’d be biking on a rainy day, and the fog would be so thick that we couldn’t even see our own hands gripping onto our bike handle bars for dear life.  Every day was exciting and new.

Even more diverse than the topography of PCH are the people who travel on it. Every night, Jake and I would stay at a different campsite, and every night we would meet cool new people. One of my favorite memories from the trip is the night we spent in Kirk Creek Campground. We were sharing a campsite with a couple from Glasgow and a couple from Chattanooga Tennessee. The couple from Chattanooga invited us all to join them around a bonfire. Jake and I sat down, and we ended up talking with these strangers for the next 3 hours as the sun set and the fire burned out. We discussed gun laws in America, the upcoming presidential election, same-sex marriage, health care, Brexit, and war. Jake and I are pretty liberal Canadians, and the couple from Glasgow was liberal as well, whereas the couple from Tennessee was more conservative and had very different worldviews than the rest of us. It was wonderfully eye-opening to be discussing these heavy topics with people who see things so differently than I do. It was one of the most memorable conversations I’ve had.
Martina Erdstein | Daily Trojan
Every night of this trip was colored by interesting conversations, and every day consisted of endless miles of biking, aching quads, nonstop consumption of disgusting and delicious food combinations (my favorite was the Nutella, cream cheese, Oreo bagel sandwich), and exploration of interesting new places.
After 10 days, 500 miles, and a few misadventures, we finally arrived in Los Angeles. As we approached the Santa Monica Pier, we began to slow down. Before this, every day had been about crushing all of the miles as fast as we could. But now that we were done, we didn’t want our ride to be over. We had come to realize this experience was about the journey and not the destination. Yes, we had arrived in Los Angeles and accomplished something amazing! But even more important than accomplishing what we had set out to do were the accomplishments we hadn’t even anticipated. I experienced exhaustion like I’d never known before. I met some of the most interesting, eccentric people from all over the world. I saw beautiful parts of California that literally took my breath away. I had wonderful, eye-opening conversations. I laughed so hard that I cried. I experienced happiness in a rare way — it was a feeling that I was doing exactly what I was meant to be doing, and that there was nothing in the world that would make me happier than being in the place that I was with the person I was with.

America is, first and foremost, a democracy. While the definition can get muddled from time to time — especially within partisan politics — one of the main guiding principles of democracy is transparency. Transparency within the government means that citizens know their President’s actions, along with an understanding of his or her policies.
Now that everything is digital, the “information highway” confuses the definitions of transparency and accountability even further.Everything is accessible at the touch of our fingertips: tax reports, presidential history, celebrity gossip and more. Some databases have capitalized on the controversy surrounding public and private information. In the realm of private information, there is much in the world of politics that has not come out. Databases like WikiLeaks strive to minimize the gap, taking it upon themselves to create a more transparent perception of government. So while at first glance WikiLeaks seems like a harmful source for journalism and politics alike, it does much to uphold the level of transparency and accountability within the field. You may want to think twice before criticizing the website over your favorite candidate.
As a result of its bipartisan functionality, WikiLeaks has the ability to govern both the Republican and Democratic parties in American politics. By releasing confidential reports, the organization aims to hold government accountable for their actions: If officials are caught with questionable documents, their reputations and reelections could be jeopardized. By regulating the various sectors within the government, WikiLeaks helps to form a stronger, more open government structure. Journalists have every right to use WikiLeaks’ information to better supplement their reports. 
WikiLeaks is an organization that exists outside of political boundaries to reveal secrets related to government officials, espionage and corruption. Because of its existence as a non-governmental actor, it is not controlled by the government and cannot be influenced by the government. This has definite advantages: In times of scandal, it cannot be persuaded to sway its audience one way or another, unlike other news information sites. For example, in the face of a wiretapping scandal, The New York Times was told to delay releasing their story for a year. Conversely, WikiLeaks has none of these restrictions: they can publish whatever they want, whenever they want to.
 Unfortunately, WikiLeaks has come under considerable critique recently in  light of the 2016 presidential election. More specifically, it has recently started publishing emails from the Clinton campaign — emails that show that the former secretary of state is not necessarily the saint her campaign tries to suggest. While this is hardly surprising news, one particular leaked email from the account of her Campaign Chairman, John Podesta, shows Politico, a news site, asking for his approval on an article about Clinton prior to publication. This is a violation of ethics in journalism: Reporters must seek out the truth, not what their sources want them to write. Newsrooms and newspapers are not propaganda machines, and both reporters and authority figures must understand that they cannot bypass the very purpose of news information.
 In releasing information as revealing as the Podesta email, WikiLeaks aims to regulate major events like the election campaign by keeping all parties honest. If the candidates wish to uphold their esteemed reputations, the threat of WikiLeaks publishing any dishonorable information should prevent them from performing shady actions in the first place. This website provides a somewhat harsh but necessary system of checks and balances where political jurisdiction fails.
With their words, figures and graphs, journalists can present the news to the general public, whether or not it is framed objectively or in a certain light, so that everyday citizens can also understand the news. The average American does not read WikiLeaks, but the nature of journalism allows them that freedom.

Over the past few weeks, WikiLeaks has been releasing hoards of hacked emails allegedly recovered from the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Last Thursday, private researchers said that Russian actors were likely behind the hack. The Podesta leaks come in the wake of numerous other hacks by Russian hackers in an effort to influence the American election, according to government officials. The content of the Podesta emails ranges from the legitimately substantive to the completely frivolous. The emails include some significant material, such as the much-sought-after transcripts of speeches Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs. Mostly, however, the emails give unshocking details into Podesta’s relationships with political figures and the inter-workings of the Clintonian world. 
These emails contain dense amounts of information regarding one of the most significant figures in American politics so, naturally, journalists have seized this opportunity to report on the plethora of new material from inside the Clinton campaign. However, in the wake of these and numerous other hacks, some have legitimately questioned the ethics of reporting on illegally released information. The job of the journalist is to report on worthy information, but the process of obtaining the information should not be ignored. News organizations should discern the ethical implications of publishing illegally stolen documents. Of course information within a prominent political person’s email account will provide weighty and juicy news fodder. But if the means of obtaining this information is through such dubious means, news organizations should, at the very least, seriously question using it. 
In the past few months, Russian hackers have consistently attempted to hack into American accounts, servers and websites. With the public release of so many private emails, personal zones of privacy are being completely eroded. While the Podesta leaks may give journalists compelling material, it also shares the intimate details of individuals’ personal lives to the world. Every person, regardless of their public prominence, deserves a space to discuss and discern with confidants and friends. Releasing hacked emails completely undermines an individual’s sense of privacy. Nearly everyone says things over email that they wouldn’t share in public and emails can make comments made to friends seem far more important than they actually are. 
While these recent leaks provide information about Hillary Clinton, they also come from illegally obtained documents never intended for public consumption. Today it is Clinton, but tomorrow it could be the Republicans or even the news organizations themselves. Reporting of these hacked documents opens the door for complete disregard of private correspondence of any figure in public life. As Sen. Marco Rubio said, “Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.”

The Pentagon Papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg who had worked on the study, and first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of The New York Times in 1971.  They were classified documents and Ellsberg broke the law to release them and the press was complicit by publishing the material.  It already was the Republicans who got burned (for you kids who don’t know your recent history, Nixon, a Republican, was President at the time).   BTW the Russian hackers thing is not proven at this point.  You are repeating a suspicion, not a fact.  And Podesta is a sleazebag of the first order.  If you want to keep your government from being sold, you want to encourage the criminals to rat out the guilty.  Right now Hilly and Billy take money from oppressive regimes seeking to buy influence.  Fact.  Deal with it.
