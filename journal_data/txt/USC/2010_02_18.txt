Pre-health students will gather for a conference on Sunday to discuss global health care issues and how they affect different aspects of the medical field.
The Alpha Epsilon Delta pre-medical honors society will host its annual Southland Pre-Health Conference, featuring a keynote speaker from the USC Institute for Global Health. The conference is held annually to educate pre-health undergraduates about the medical field.
“The way we want to relate global health things is that we want to give a perspective of health as a whole in the entire world. But at the same time, we want to compare that to our health care system here,” Southland co-chair David Daar said.
Keynote speaker Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health, was asked to speak because he represents the focus of the conference: global health care.
AED chose to focus on global health care because of rising student interest in wanting to practice medicine outside of the United States.
“A lot of our members are interested in the [World Health Organization] or the doctors without borders,” Daar said.
Daar and co-chair Emma McDonnell said this year’s conference will be different from previous ones because it will span many different facets of medicine.
“Our variety of speakers is definitely different. We tried to pull in people from all facets of health care or physical therapists or physician assistants,” McDonnell said.
McDonnell added that AED collaborated with pre-pharmacy students this year, something they’ve never done before.
The conference will also feature Gina Camello, associate director of admissions at the USC Keck School of Medicine, who will talk to students about applying to medical school.
Although health care reform will not be a main focus, organizers said they have asked many of the medical experts to touch on the potential health care changes.
“We’ve asked our individual speakers to talk about how the health care reform will affect them personally,” McDonnell said.
Along with speakers and workshops, the test-prep company Princeton Review will be hosting a raffle for two $1,000 scholarships for MCAT prep classes. One scholarship is enough to cover half the price of a standard course. Kaplan will also have representatives at the conference.
The focus of the conference is not admissions, though, Daar said. Instead, AED hopes to give attendees a picture of health care today and a sense of what their careers might be like.
“It’s for students by students,” he said.
This is the 44th Southland conference at USC, but AED has only recently started hosting the event at the Davidson Conference Center, McDonnell said.
The majority of the cost of holding the conference is renting the Davidson center, according to McDonnell. AED received funding from the Undergraduate Student Government, as well as the Office of the Provost, through support from Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers.
“We got $2,000 after presenting to the professional fund at USG,” McDonnell said. “We also got shirts donated from the bookstore as part of the thank you packages we’re giving to [the speakers].”
Jeff Sakamoto, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said he would consider going to the pre-health conference to explore his options. For now, Sakamoto said, he wants to go into the medical field, but he’s not sure what aspect he wants to focus on.
“I would go to get more of a broader view on medicine — I mean, medicine is such a huge field — just to see what I’d be interested in doing because there’s so much that you can do in medicine,” Sakamoto said.

Seniors will soon have a chance to decide what their legacy will be.
The options for the senior class gift were announced this week and include a tribute to President Steven B. Sample, a solar thermal energy system for the Lyon Center pool, a class of 2010 internship award and a class of 2010 Volunteer Center van.
“As a board, we looked into the preferences of the senior class and underfunded initiatives on campus and proposed a diverse list of gift options,” said Katherine Prendergast, the chair of the Senior Gift Advisory Board and a senior majoring in international relations and fine arts. “After we collected all our ideas, we had a meeting where we discussed our findings and ranked our favorite options that had been vetted through the university.”
The final gift ideas run the gamut, from environmental initiatives to a plaque in Sample’s honor.
If chosen as the senior gift, the plaque would be placed on Alumni Walk next to the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Seniors hoping to leave an environmentally friendly impact can vote for a solar thermal energy system for the Lyon Center pool. Currently, the pool is heated with boilers that burn natural gas. If this gift is chosen, the senior class will donate money to the USC sustainability office to help accelerate the implementation of a solar energy system to heat the pool. USC will provide the rest of the money, and the project would likely start in summer 2010.
The class of 2010 internship award, if chosen, will create a fund to help students afford to take unpaid internships or volunteer opportunities. The fund would help students entering their senior year. The Office of Financial Aid has offered to match the senior class’s donation to the fund.
The final option for this year’s senior gift will provide the USC Volunteer Center with a van to shuttle students to volunteer opportunities around the city.
“It was important for us to select a variety of gifts but also ones that were both feasible, accessible to a bunch of students and most importantly approved by the university,” Prendergast said.
Seniors will have the chance to vote for their favorite option beginning Feb. 23.
Caitlyn Crisp, a senior majoring in communication and gender studies, said she thinks the gifts offer a good variety of choices.
“I’m going to vote for the solar panel because I think it’s the most beneficial for our university because it’s actually making progress,” Crisp said. “The tribute to President Sample was appealing, but as nice as that is he would even probably prefer we do something that’s more eco-friendly and making our campus more green.”
Crisp said she plans to donate regardless of which gift is chosen in the end.
Jamie Wolf, a senior majoring in occupational therapy, said she too will definitely donate because her program requires it.
She said she was pleased with the options.
“I like the tribute to President Sample because it’s nice to acknowledge all of the hard work he’s done for the school,” Wolf said.
Susie Phadke, a senior majoring in kinesiology, said she is leaning toward options that help the community.
“It’s important to give back to the school because it’s given so much to us, but it’s more important to give back to the community. I’ll eventually end up donating money to the school, but I would like for the senior gift to benefit the community,” Phadke said.
Regardless of which gift is voted the winner, Prendergast said she hopes everyone will donate.
“It’s a way for the class of 2010 to participate in this tradition collectively as a class, and it’s a way to give back to the university that has done so much for us,” she said.
The Senior Gift Advisory Board is hoping to reach at least 86 percent participation, slightly higher than last year’s 85.2 percent, the highest ever.
Some said the gift chosen might affect their decision to give money.
“I do think it’s important to participate, but I think I would only donate depending on what the gift is,” said Kelly Williams, a senior majoring in business and accounting.
Organizers are expecting the economy to have some effect on the total amount of donations, which is typically around $20,000.
But the focus is not as much the amount of money as the participation rate, according to Kim Newstadt, the assistant director at the USC Office of Annual Giving.
“The real objective is participation rather than dollar amount,” Newstadt said.
“As seniors are prepared to take the next step in their lives, we’re hoping that they want to make a lasting donation to USC. Even just a few dollars makes a difference.”
Previous senior gifts have ranged from a bench on campus to a history station or funding for specific initiatives or programs.
Last year’s class donated an endowment to restore the Von KleinSmid Center bell tower, and the class of 2008 donated a study alcove for the future Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The advisory board hopes seniors recognize the importance of making a lasting connection to their alma mater.
“USC has given us so much: memories, a great education, friends for a lifetime,” said Prendergast.

The USC Office of Admission has seen a small increase in the number of transfer applications received this year, though officials say the jump is not dramatic.
According to Tim Brunold, director of undergraduate admission, the number of transfer applications is up about 3 to 5 percent.
Brunold said the increase of California applicants is not drastically different than the overall increase in applications, though he suspects the slight increase can be attributed to the current turmoil in higher education.
“It’s probably been a 200 application increase from California, which would be proportional to that overall increase,” Brunold said.
With the recent budget cuts to California higher education, state community colleges and University of California schools have had to cut back on the number of courses offered to its students, raising a possible explanation for the increase in transfer applications.
“I wouldn’t say that the increase has been dramatic,” Brunold said. “It’s not as if we are seeing a huge percentage increase from a certain type of school, but there definitely has been a reasonable size increase from the UCs. Last year we got about 400 from the UC system, and this year we have about 450 — an increase that is more than coincidental.”
According to preliminary data, the quality of the transfer applicant pool has also stayed at a high level, a trend that the admission office said it sees every year.
“We do ask for students to self-report what their GPA is, and that number is at the same high quality it has been in past years,” Brunold said. “Those patterns look similar, which is a very positive thing for us.”
For Kevin Khakshouri, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, his transfer from Santa Monica College to USC brought with it a change in work ethic.
“You have to do a lot more reading; it’s basically more work,” Khakshouri said of his transition to USC. “I could get by without doing the reading, whereas at ’SC I can’t wait till the last minute. I have to stay consistent.”
For USC, the recent transfer applicant pool is indicative of the increasing caliber of students looking to transfer.
“Our transfer applicants are very high quality. Last year the average transfer had a 3.65 GPA. Every indication so far is that the quality has stayed the same. It certainly has not gone down,” Brunold said. “It’s getting to the point where the typical rate of transfer admission is similar to freshman admits.”

When voting for Undergraduate Student Government closed at 8 p.m. on Thursday, 4,561 students had voted online and an estimated 100 to 200 students had filed paper ballots.
Emiko Suzuki, USG’s co-director of elections and recruitment, said when final numbers are determined this year’s total will likely be around 4,800 votes. This total is consistent with last year’s election, which brought 4,617 students to the polls.
Suzuki said the turnout met USG’s expectations.
“Usually the problem with USG is that a lot of students don’t know about it,” Suzuki said. “So I think that the fact that we got almost a fourth of the undergraduate population is a pretty impressive number.”
Despite the cancellation of USG’s carnival — typically held during the voting period to draw in voters — Suzuki and other USG officials said they had no problems raising awareness.
I think we did a very good job in getting as much publicity out there, advertising to as many people to vote and the importance of voting,” Chan said.
Chan said Tuesday’s “Rock the Vote” event was particularly successful in increasing voter turnout.
Now that voting has closed, candidates and students must wait until Tuesday for the unofficial results to be announced.
Presidential candidate Dylan Dann said this week was “exciting” and that he is anxious to hear the results.
“It’s kind of stressful with a bunch of different emotions,” Dann said. “It’s really just been an adventure.”
The unofficial results will be announced on Feb. 23, and the official results will be announced March. 2.
The unofficial results are based solely on electronic and paper votes. The official results will be announced once the candidates are determined to be in good standing with Student Affairs, have completed their budget proposals and when everything is cleared with the Elections Commission.
The lag in announcements is because of the scheduling of Senate meetings.
What’s the other type(s) of voting? 
“The unofficial results are based solely on electronic and paper votes.”

Martin Scorsese has been behind the development of no small number of great actors. For instance, if it weren’t for him, Robert De Niro would not be the actor he is today. And, as the director’s new film Shutter Island will confirm, if not for Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn’t be one of the best actors of his generation.
While DiCaprio has been a household name since the mid-1990s, he has not always been considered a serious actor. His role in Titanic confirmed him as more of a heartthrob than a thespian to be taken seriously, and, with only a few good films here and there, DiCaprio initially seemed destined for a short-lived career.
It was in 2002 that the actor finally gained recognition, and from two of Hollywood’s top directors no less. DiCaprio’s appearances in both Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can and Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York initially garnered skepticism — after all, most audiences were exclusively familiar with the actor through his character in Titanic — but the release of both films presented audiences with a completely different star.
No longer just an uncomplicated picture of adolescence, DiCaprio began pursuing problematic roles in which characters had their youth but found themselves unable to enjoy it, usually because of inner turmoil.
While Spielberg’s film presents dramatic emotion, it does so in a happier light with only very subtle hints of weariness. It wasn’t until Scorsese’s first collaboration with DiCaprio that the young actor was able to showcase the extent of the inner conflict he could put forth on screen.
At its heart, Gangs of New York is a simple film about revenge. DiCaprio portrays Amsterdam, a man whose father was killed when Amsterdam was only a boy by the ruthless Bill the Butcher. After his release from a reform school, Amsterdam eventually returns to New York to seek his revenge. In order to kill the butcher, however, Ansterdam must first gain his trust to get close to him.
This is where DiCaprio excels — in his ability to convey the conflict between the desire to kill a man while respecting and even loving him at the same time. None of his earlier films allowed him to illustrate such intricacies on screen. He had to work with someone like Scorsese to accomplish this.
As one of the best living American filmmakers, Scorsese has redefined the idea of conflict in film narrative, and it is something he has been doing for over 40 years.
Scorsese’s earlier films like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, along with his later works such as The Last Temptation of Christ and Goodfellas, all portray characters who are flawed, confused and incredibly conflicted. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, DiCaprio said, “What Scorsese does so well is when the lead character starts to betray you after a while: After you’re with him, he starts to do things you don’t understand.”
And this sentiment is exactly what has made DiCaprio such a diligent actor since he started working with Scorsese.
In Gangs of New York, Amsterdam starts to love his enemy, and in their next collaboration, The Aviator, the brilliant Howard Hughes gains all the momentum of both aerodynamics and audiences but then loses all of it through blatant misunderstandings and is ultimately ruined.
It made perfect sense for Scorsese and DiCaprio to work together on a film about the life of Hughes because it radiates everything appropriate about their own working relationship. The film personifies personal conflict, and the director and actor thrive off of manifesting cinematic conflict.
To date, The Departed is the best personification of the power these two artists share together, and it is the defining film that has made DiCaprio a great actor.
His character, a Boston state police trooper undercover in the Irish mob, is conflicted between two worlds to the point where he loses all sense of normalcy. By investing himself so thoroughly into a world that lacks morality, he loses his true identity and completely isolates himself from the person he once was.
The Departed, without a doubt, showcases DiCaprio at his very best, and by working with Scorsese yet again, DiCaprio was able to go on and give one incredible performance after another. Without their developed relationship, DiCaprio would not have succeeded in Blood Diamond, Body of Lies and Revolutionary Road.
He would not be who he is today, and Shutter Island would not look as promising. Sure, it is a Scorsese film, and that alone suggests merit. But it is the fact that the film features both a great director and a great actor that gives the film its true momentum.
After all, Taxi Driver would not be Taxi Driver if not for Scorsese and De Niro, and certainly Shutter Island will not be as good as it hopefully is without Scorsese and DiCaprio.

The Ghost Writer, controversial Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski’s newest film, was made under intense personal stress. Filmed in exile, edited under house arrest and released during complicated legal troubles, the resulting film is a claustrophobic, compelling thriller that feels only a little bit rushed. Some guys can’t write five-paragraph essays after their girlfriends break up with them — the fact that Polanski was able to make the movie at all is a testament to his love for the art, and, with today’s release, Polanski shows that he can still make a great film.

The Ghost Writer follows Ewan McGregor’s character, a writer referred to only as “the ghost,” as he undertakes to finish the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). Though Lang is cooperative and feeds the ghost sandwiches, the suspicious circumstances of his predecessor’s death lead the ghost to suspect that the enigmatic Lang might be a less than scrupulous politician. The ghost, who only took the job for the money, quickly finds himself neck-deep in conspiracy theories and high-stakes political scheming.
Performances by the primaries are stellar. McGregor is great, but it’s Brosnan who truly excels under Polanski’s direction. Brosnan’s ability to maintain a witty geniality when he seems ready to boil over makes for a remarkably nuanced performance that he’s hasn’t achieved before.
Olivia Williams, Timothy Hutton, Tom Wilkinson, Kim Cattrall and Jim Belushi round out the cast as Lang’s cronies. Cattrall and Belushi might seem like questionable choices, but Polanski has always been adept with actors. The performances are successful across the board.
The story is based on a novel by author Robert Harris, and, though the premise isn’t groundbreaking, Polanski and Harris competently build a complex and believable world. Though sometimes a little bogged down with its own politics, the script flows remarkably well. Until an elderly local steps in to elucidate any questions the audience might have, The Ghost Writer has all the makings of a classic keep-them-guessing thriller.
Polanski’s skills as a writer should be commended, but elements of the storytelling feel haphazard for such an experienced filmmaker. The plot gets overstuffed with unnecessary and occasionally silly details, and every “key witness in a coma” excuse falls progressively flatter than the one before it. Does the audience really need an “old timer familiar with the currents” to tell them the previous ghost writer’s allegedly accidental drowning was — gasp — not accidental? There are CSI episodes that handle the same reveal with more aplomb. When the penultimate twist is spelled out — really, literally S-P-E-L-L-E-D out — it becomes clear Polanski is filling in blanks that didn’t need filling. Somewhere, hidden amid cheap plot points, there is an extremely intelligent story that doesn’t need help in establishing its narrative. This is the film’s biggest problem, and, though it’s nice to imagine the increased tension that would have accompanied subtler storytelling, the filmmakers can’t be faulted for pandering to the public. Since this is the biggest suspense film in a while that doesn’t feature Shia LaBeouf, some might need a step-by-step refresher course in the finer points of the thriller genre. All the same, Polanski deserves credit for maintaining a highly intense film with these crude, fun-spoiling plot points included.
Alexandre Desplat delivers his typically great score, expertly balancing his music with Polanski’s infamously suspenseful direction. Desplat has been nominated again for an original score Oscar this year — for the peppy music from Fantastic Mr. Fox — but, if he doesn’t win for that, he should get consideration next year for his unnerving, energetic work in this film. The score proves essential to maintaining Polanski’s atmosphere, and Desplat deserves kudos for this achievement.
In fact, the entire cast and crew deserve praise. If it weren’t for those gratuitous plot devices, the film would be near perfect. The story is gripping despite the aforementioned pandering, and the sharper twists are rewarding. And as could be expected from Polanski’s director, the last moments of the film are absolutely stunning — emotionally and aesthetically. It’s that last moment, in all its subtle, devilishly clever glory, that reminds viewers that Polanski is an indomitable master and provokes the same viewers to wonder where he was two minutes ago when Speak & Spell was spoon-feeding them the story.
Technically and aesthetically exceptional in sound, direction and performance, The Ghost Writer shines through its weaker moments and adds further clout to the already astounding repertoire of Roman Polanski.
Thank you for proving my point.
So what’s your beef with North Dakota? I hear it’s lovely there.
Joe,
Does anyone really care about you, or what you think? You seem to have a penchant for posting here opinions that the average retiree from the middle of North Dakota has… opinions completely irrelevant and unsophisticated.
Oh, so the “sophisticated” thing to do is to ignore the child rape and pretend Polanski is some kind of edgy artist that anyone would care about if he weren’t milking the “misunderstood artist persecuted by the unjust law” thing for all it was worth?
Wow, it sounds like that child rapist can really make an entertaining flick. I wonder if they have a certification at the end of the credits, “No animals were harmed, and no children were molested, in the making of this film.”

Every fall semester, a select group of 11 students are accepted into the USC School of Theatre’s Masters in Fine Arts in Acting Program beginning a three-year journey toward professional acting. Currently in its fourth year, this relatively new program gives its graduating classes the opportunity to create yet another USC tradition — a rotating three-play repertory.
Passionate · Andrew J. Robinson has been the director of the USC School of Theatre’s MFA in Acting Program since its creation four years ago. This year’s graduating class is performing a three-play repertory. - Photo courtesy of USC School of Theatre 
Unlike last year’s MFA class — the first to graduate from the program — which performed two plays in the fall and one in the spring, the 2010 class has planned for all three plays to run simultaneously during a one-month period.
Although the change might seem minor, dirctor Andrew J. Robinson made an effort to constantly push and develop his actors and refine the cirriculum.
“No other MFA training program in the country does [a rotating repertory],” Robinson said. “This is a major deal.”
The MFA students spent months preparing for their respective roles in the three plays, Pericles, Orestes 2.0 and Fisher King, and started by selecting the stories themselves.
First, Robinson and his professional team choose plays that were right for the group, as each graduating class varies in gender and racial diversity. Second, they wanted plays that provided the 11-member cast with an equal amount of work. For instance, Thomas Chavira II has a minor role in Orestes 2.0 but has a much greater role in Pericles and Fisher King. And third, in contrast to last year’s more traditional repertory, Robinson and his team chose lesser-known works.
Performing less common plays requires the actors to thoroughly understand their characters and forces them to bring their own sentiments into the story. As lesser-known works, there are fewer expectations of how the play should be performed and the result is a presentation that comes alive with originality.
“This is the equivalent of a master’s thesis for these students,” Robinson said. “This is the application and culmination of all their skills classes and the work that they have done in the previous two and a half years.”
By bringing together these three vastly different plays, the program offers another level of training intensity for these MFA students. Under Robinson’s leadership, the third-year actors learn to take on different characters and then summon them when rotating from play to play. In essence, they are learning to use their bodies as instruments for character exploration.
“The great excitement for me is walking into a room and sitting down with the audience and watching live people,” Robinson said. “Where the excitement pays off is when those people I’m watching on stage have a story to tell, that they are trained and they are able to express deep truths that a playwright is exploring.”
For example, Pericles — the Shakespeare play being performed this month — opened at 2:30 p.m. on a Saturday earlier this month but was quickly followed by Orestes 2.0 at 8 p.m. The actors only had a three-hour window to take a mental break and then prepare for their roles in the next play.
“[By doing this,] they are now professional actors as far as I’m concerned,” Robinson said.
Though the student actors make it look easy, this is one rigorous program. Like at the rest of USC, the  MFA in Acting Program selects a diverse body of students; hopefuls are recruited from all over the country to audition. But the program isn’t looking for the next James Dean or Brad Pitt. Unlike the inbred environment of the old Hollywood legacy system, the program’s directors seek out actors who stand out in their own right, making for a much richer and varied set of actors to reflect today’s more global society.
In addition to selection and rigorous training, the School of Theatre’s MFA in Acting Program strikes a delicate balance between theater acting and commercialization, since the latter is still important. Upon completion of the three-plays, the program brings in casting directors, agents, managers and other specialists so that the rest of the semester is devoted to helping the students transition into the commercial side of acting.
These students are fortunate to be a part of this program. Robinson has such a strong commitment and genuine interest in making this top-notch actor-training program even better. It’s his passion for his team, students and the art of acting that drives the program, and that passion motivates everyone. Robinson believes that the best actors start in theater.
“Most of the actors that we love, come out of theater,” Robinson said. “That was our training. That is where we learned how to do it.”

Earlier this month, Utah Sen. Chris Buttars put many up in arms by proposing to nix the senior year of high school for Utah teens in an effort to minimize the state’s massive $700 million deficit.
Understandably, educators argued that doing so would deprive students of a formative year before college or the working world. In addition, the education system would have to be revamped, incurring high costs. In response, Buttars changed his proposal, offering to make 12th grade optional instead.
To many, his original proposal was outlandish. Critics champion the final year of high school as important, memorable and worthwhile. It triggers fond memories for many students, from the quintessential prom to the tears at graduation; that final year is the ideal culmination of 12 years of schooling, the final threshold to cross before achieving a new level of freedom in the real world.
Utah Rep. Marie Poulson said senior year is the time that students mature and excel in academics and extracurricular activities — a time for students to glean as much information from their mentors as possible, unwind and spend time with their friends and ruminate over the fact that they and their classmates’ paths might never cross again. The strongest argument against the proposal states that senior year serves as the transition phase from adolescence to adulthood, a crucial step that should not be overlooked, let alone removed altogether.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Many argue that a junior in high school, typically a 17 year-old, is not remotely ready for the pressures of college or the working world. But what makes an 18-year-old any more ready for the pressures that await after graduation? Being one year older does not make a person one year wiser. It’s not time that makes the difference; it’s the experiences and lessons that elicit change in maturity. It appears the current model of a “crucial” senior year is lacking in, well, the crucial caveat of helping one transition to adulthood.
As fun as it is to use senioritis as a crutch for laziness, senior year is also somewhat a waste of time and money. Buttars said, “If you talk to a hundred [seniors], you’ll hear over and over that, ‘I took four PE classes and two art classes.’ That’s not the way to spend the public’s money.”
In a way, he is right. His proposal, which is currently being debated in the Utah state Senate, would save the state $60 million a year in expenses.
Needless to say, there are countless motivated high school students who take a slew of AP classes up until graduation. But then again, they sometimes pass over senior year as a mere roadblock to the life they are so eager to begin living — the independence of a college student or working adult. And for the other camp of students — the elective-takers described by Buttars — senior year only prolongs the time they spend learning things of no interest to them. In either case, Buttars could be onto something with his proposal, since that final year might not contribute as much to one’s education as educators had hoped.
Maybe Buttars’ plan is not completely far-fetched or novel after all. In fact, some high-performing countries have public education systems that are very different from the one we are used to. Schools in Singapore end their high school-equivalent education after 10th grade, when students can opt to attend a junior college for two years before entering a university or attend a vocation-oriented polytechnic. France also offers students a similar option to pursue higher education, while Italian upper secondary schools have a greater focus on the humanities, something most public American schools don’t emphasize.
The proposal is difficult for us to swallow because we are so steeped in the American public education system that we can’t see room for reform. There is still much to learn from other education systems around the world, and given the deficits faced by the state of Utah and the country, it might be wise to rethink the education system.
Buttars’ bill might be able to kill two birds with one stone. Instead of funneling precious state funds to keep seniors in school — many of them are afflicted by senioritis anyway and don’t take full advantage of the education — the funds could be somehow used to rectify the debt and Utah would become a valuable laboritory for alternative modes of education in the United States.  As renowned American educational reformer, psychologist and philosopher John Dewey once proposed, a student’s experience of actively learning should be the focus of an education. And if during the senior year of high school most students are doing anything but actively learning, what is the point of that education?
Nadine Tan is a sophomore majoring in business administration. Her column “World Rapport” runs Fridays.
This article suffers from crippling generalizations and a failure to consider that many countries with lower school requirements have adjusted their age laws for accommodation, something the US has not done.
In particular, Tan dismisses typical seniors as lazy with far too much assuredness. There are certainly some seniors who coast through their last year of high school, but many make the most out of being in school at a time where they have entered adult age and are more capable than ever of absorbing difficult material. I say this as a veteran of regular public school education.
Moreover, I am not convinced that most 11th graders are in fact ready to transition into the adult world. For one, they are not legally adults yet, which will make for a year of logistical misery. As for emotional maturity, there are always exceptions, but the argument of “It’s not the years, it’s the educational experience” is often used as a crutch by those eager to get high school or college over with early, who most often end up regretting such premature excitement to move on.
In short, this is a terrible idea, and I am sad that a fellow college student could embrace it so openly.

Perhaps it’s because so many students are from outside of Los Angeles, thinking wistfully of places where February means actual snow and not 80-degree days inexplicably bookended by rain, that the Winter Olympics have been so welcomed on campus.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately for many eager viewers crowded around their dorm neighbor’s coveted flat-screen, the first images they were affronted with Friday were not of the gathering crowd in Vancouver or Lindsey Vonn’s warm-up routine. They were the last moments in the life of Nodar Kumaritišvili, the 21-year-old Georgian luger who lost control of his sled during a training run and fatally catapulted into a metal beam.
NBC warned its viewers, before releasing the footage, that it would be hard to watch.
Still, that disclaimer did little to quell the rising tide of disgust and indignation that followed.
NBC did not only make the video of the crash public — which included graphic images of a battered Kumaritišvili receiving on-site CPR — but also repeated the exact moment of death, in slow motion, three times within the span of a few minutes.
Most unconscionable of all, NBC chose to air it at the very beginning of the opening ceremonies, before Kumaritišvili’s family had even been notified of the accident.
Viewers from across the globe are now castigating the network for making public a host of images that are extremely sensitive, both emotionally and ethically. And in a culture where we find immense entertainment in the freak accidents of others (Darwin Awards, anyone?), such an overwhelmingly negative response is a clear reflection of the grimness of the footage and the over-eagerness of our media to share it with the world.
As a nation, we love extreme sports. We are fascinated by speed, danger and the possibility of things going wrong.
But to broadcast the moment of a man’s death on national television is different. It crosses the line from entertaining to invasive, especially when the footage is coming from a news source, which could have arguably informed its viewers of the tragedy just as thoroughly using only selected portions of the video or a narrative describing what happened. Such voyeurism has made even accident-loving America uncomfortable.
“If [the victim] was me or someone I knew, I would never want it to be broadcast across the country,” said Mychal Bailey, a freshman majoring in fine arts. “It’s so insensitive that everyone gets to see his death at the same time that his family’s grieving.”
NBC, as the syndicated USA Olympics rights holder, certainly wasted no time spreading the footage. According to the Associated Press, NBC does not usually make a practice of releasing its Olympics coverage to other media outlets. Yet within a matter of hours, ABC, CBS and a host of other networks had suddenly been granted access to the video — NBC had sold it to them.
“We released the footage because this was a significant news event,” the network stated.
While the media has an obligation to keep its audience informed to the best of its ability, there are certain cases in which possession of unique footage does not necessarily justify using it.
Had the video been released for the sake of improving safety precautions, its use might have been substantiated.
Showing a man’s death to the nation, potentially even to the entire world, is not by definition unwarranted. Eddie Adams’ famous photograph of a Viet Cong officer being shot in the head point blank during the Tet Offensive (ironically, NBC was there to broadcast that death too) was a decisive factor in bringing to light the horrors of the Vietnam War; the image was a reflection of a conflict that embroiled a nation. Its lack of censorship helped us realize the need to extract ourselves from the war, to effect change on a global level.
Nothing constructive was accomplished by bringing Kumaritišvili’s final moments into the living rooms of North America. The footage is excessive and without purpose; it’s not seeking to change anything.
In 2001, when a similar video of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt’s fatal crash on the track of the Daytona 500 was replayed over and over, it could be argued the publicity contributed to racing safety improvements, including seat belt inspections and head and neck restraints.
Still, the officials involved recognized that the accident was an improbable one and that drastic changes in the sport would not be effective. “We are … not going to react for the sake of reacting,” declared NASCAR President Mike Helton.
This sentiment could have been echoed by Olympic organizers handling the aftermath of Kumaritišvili’s death, who noted they were changing the luge course more for the benefit of the athletes’ states of mind than to correct any mechanical flaws.
It appears, then, that the mass distribution of Kumaritišvili’s fatal moment of impact can’t even claim to have a purpose in education or safety. Sure, it’s relative to the Olympics, and it’s certainly news, but the bottom line is that death is something that should be granted privacy.
If nothing constructive can come of a world seeing a man’s final moments, there’s no excuse for using it to garner publicity and make a profit. NBC, in its eagerness to provide us the full story with graphic content, should have used more discretion.

With the American financial crisis still looming over us, influencing political pandering in Washington and a wave of populist anger elsewhere, other financial bubbles have begun to burst all over the world.
What came out of those untimely bursted bubbles?
Doubt about the stability of the world economy and the global marketplace that could shuffle the economic order as we know it.  
Recently, the Greek financial crisis has been a hot button issue. Despite having a population smaller than the state of Pennsylvania, Greece is in danger and could have a huge effect on the global economy.
Greece joined the European Union in 1981, but it took 20 years for the country to be economically stable enough to replace the Greek Drachma with the euro. The E.U.’s strict policy with regard to economic viability, including country debt limitations, prompted Greece to resort to less than savory tactics to fabricate a pristine fiscal condition.
It appears the same Wall Street tactics that caused the mortgage crisis in America were employed to boost the balance sheet of Mediterranean state. The Greeks invited investment bank Goldman Sachs and hedge fund the John Paulson Group, to spray paint the elephant in the room invisible. Goldman Sachs was on the scene in Athens in 2001 to arrange large transactions with the goal of reducing public debt (which had by that time exceeded annual Greek gross domestic product) but instead hid billions from overseers in Brussels. According to the Financial Times, bankers and officials say that the swaps were legal.
As recently as a month ago, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou met with Gary Cohn, president and COO of Goldman Sachs. Curiously, Goldman denies to comment on the Greek issue.
There is something rotten in the state of Greece.
Since Greece is part of the euro zone, and because there is a large chance the rest of the countries could feasibly go down with the ship that is the euro currency, Germany and France — the two most politically and economically powerful countries within the euro zone — have a duty to the E.U. to face the challenge of the Greek issue.
So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have addressed a need for a solution but have not committed to anything concrete. The hesitance in both countries to sign off on the Greek bailout is logical: If Greece got into debt trouble because of weak economic policies and if those institutional problems are not changed, then who is to say that no matter how much money is thrown Greece’s way, the problem of budget deficits won’t still persist?
Aside from a much-needed bailout, Greece should look toward the International Monetary Fund for further assistance. The Financial Times reported that the French believe the IMF, should be involved because of their expertise. Yet I have to wonder what type of technical capacity the French had in mind.
The E.U. president, Herman Van Rompuy, has high expectations for Greece. He said with the implementation of rigorous, determined measures and efforts, Greece will eliminate its budget deficit by 2012 and will cut the deficit by four percentage points of GDP in 2010. An even more optimistic approach to solving the Greek issue was supplanted by Financial Times contributor, Michael Massourakis.  He said that an E.U. bailout will not be necessary and reform and privatization should do the trick.
Call me a pessimist, but I believe things are more complicated than that.
Greece is a microcosm of a bigger problem; the Spanish and Portuguese financial crises, coupled with the Greek issue, are taking a toll on the euro zone and exhausting resources for potential solutions.
At some point E.U. policies, especially German and French policies, must accommodate the Greek issue and other economic crises within the E.U.’s midst because it needs to take care of its own, and be avoid economic self-mutilation.
Worst case scenario would be if, because of the financial crises in the euro zone, the euro took a devastating, suicidal plunge and created a global economy so off-kilter it’s aftershocks would not be just a “ripple effect” as Vanessa Rossi, economist at the think tank Chatham House, deems, but a tsunami.

“Greece should look toward the International Monetary Fund for further assistance.”
The IMF and the rest of these neoliberal economists are the ones who got Greece into these problems to begin with. How can the solution to neoliberal capitalist greed be more neoliberal capitaism?

During the USC football team’s historic run from 2002-2005 into college football immortality, the Trojans were led by All-Americans and first-round draft picks galore. From the bone-crunching hits of Troy Polamulu, to the graceful leaps of Reggie Bush, to the composure and debonair of Matt Leinart, USC fans were treated to star-studded teams with well-recognized faces, all except for one, punter Tom Malone.
For a team hailed for its high-octane offense led by the pro-bound leadership of Leinart, Bush, Carson Palmer, Steve Smith, LenDale White, and Mike Williams, it is easy to understand why Tom Malone’s name and face don’t standout in a crowd, let alone a team picture.
But Malone, despite being foreshadowed by the glitz and glamour of his offensive-minded team, was as successful a punter as USC has seen in nearly two decades. As a sophomore in 2003, he averaged 49.0 yards per punt, a stat that would have made him the top punter in the nation, had he met the required number of punts for a season.
For his career, the former-Trojan was a two-time All-Pac 10 punter and was a second-team All-AP punter back in 2004 – a year he averaged almost 44 yards per punt.
After graduating from USC in 2005, Malone took his kicking game to San Francisco as an undrafted free agent with the 49ers. He was cut shortly after the start of training camp in 2006 and has since spent parts of the last three seasons as the practice squad punter for the New England Patriots.
While it appeared the once-elite punter had run out of chances in the NFL, and that his best days were well behind him, this week Malone received a second chance thanks to a familiar friend, former USC Pete Carroll.
Although Carroll and the Seahawks already have a veteran kicker in John Ryan, who just inked a six-year, $ 9.1 million dollar deal last month, Malone will have a chance to showcase his skills this coming July during the Seahawks’ training camp after agreeing to a two-year deal.
While it is not uncommon for competition purposes to bring two punters to training camp, it seems unlikely Malone will make the team given Ryan’s veteran experience and expensive contract. Regardless, for an athlete whose career dating back to his days with USC has been overshadowed by the exploits and accomplishments of others, another chance may be just the thing the 25-year-old Malone needs to make a name for himself.

Over a decade has passed since Jimmy LaValle, former guitarist of San Diego’s Tristeza, began experimenting with synthesizers and digital pianos. On Saturday, following the release of his fifth studio LP A Chorus of Storytellers, LaValle brought his resultant creation, The Album Leaf, to the comforts of the El Rey for a night of sonic, symphonic meditation.
Mixed by LaValle and fellow post-rock master Jonsi Birgisson of Sigur Ros, Chorus is the first Album Leaf disc to feature the talents of LaValle’s live band members in the recording process. All of these players, including violinist Matthew Resovich and former Rogue Wave guitarist Gram LeBron, turned up for the show, accompanied by San Francisco’s Magik*Magik String Quartet.
LaValle, sporting a handsome black vest, emerged before a hushed crowd just past 10:30 p.m. After some awkward repositioning of musicians (there were eleven in total, making for quite the packed stage) and equipment, LaValle led the band through the new album’s first five tracks.
The show took some time to come together, much like the songs themselves. Surrounded by icicles of LED lights and projected images of fingernails, plant skins, water and other things that would make David Lynch grin, the band seemed to be groping for ideal tones. LaValle pounded away at his piano on “Blank Pages” and murmured the quiet verses of “There is a Wind” as the band tried to fill in the empty spaces.
By the time “Falling From The Sun” came around, The Album Leaf began to find its footing, ratcheting up the atmospherics with a series of elegant vocal harmonies over spare guitar notes and a lush landscape of strings from the quartet, which managed to make the best of being wedged into a corner of the stage.
The band’s decision to play the first half of its new album in succession speaks of its own departures from the minimalist style made popular by LaValle in his earlier days. Most notable is the growing inclusion of pop-inclined vocals in The Album Leaf’s material, arguably the riskiest step LaValle has taken in recent years.
Eventually, the band seamlessly delved into its older material. The glacial notes of “2214” and “The Outer Banks” evoked roars, and then entranced silence as LaValle and the band built towards pulverizing crescendos of beautiful, alien melodies.
From that point, the band never lost elevation, wandering through favorites like “Shine” and “Wherever I Go.” Even “We Are” and other newer material felt stronger and more alive here, maintaining a powerful realm of transcendent, melancholic peace. Thanks to an unusually fantastic sound arrangement, every instrument could be heard with touching resonance.
The night’s sensory highlight came during the encore. As the band performed “Red-Eye,” clouds of steam and thick layers of white noise slowly filled the room like salt water, enveloping band and audience in an aural mist of piercing notes and unsettling rumbles. If you closed your eyes, you could almost feel the North Sea winds tickling your chin, buoys of lights dancing in the fog.
Jimmy LaValle has been a musician long enough to understand the importance of aesthetic evolution. His ambitious composition, more layered and thoughtful on every record, has kept The Album Leaf from sinking into the bland tediousness that has consumed Explosions In The Sky and other post-rock outfits.
The new and more traditionally structured songs are admirable, necessary even, in their adventurousness, but they have no doubt polarized LaValle’s fans. Their live debut at the El Rey was sometimes moving, but also underwhelming. At one point, it was possible to hear both LaValle and a nearby couple debating whether to dine at Pink’s or Roscoe’s following the show.
Still, whichever direction The Album Leaf decides to take on its next studio outing, the El Rey show was hardly a breakaway from its most beloved material. If anything, its performance was a transporting and often exhilarating journey through the last 10 years of its existence in a world still largely ruled by consumable, predictable, manufactured artists.
Los Angeles native Sea Wolf opened for The Album Leaf, showcasing much material off its new album White Water, White Bloom. Alex Brown Church’s penetrating, lazy-eyed gaze hardly left the crowd as he lead the band through a warm, enthralling set, marked by Nathan Anderson’s reverberant guitars, dizzying cello work from Joyce Lee and a truly great performance of “You’re A Wolf.”

State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass announced Wednesday she will run for the California House seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Diane Watson.
“I am so proud to announce I’m going to throw my hat into the ring,” Bass told a crowd outside her Wilshire-area office, adding that she would have “very big shoes to fill.”
Watson, who is retiring at the end of her term and will not seek re-election, enthusiastically gave her support to the 56-year-old Democrat at the announcement meeting today.
“I 100 percent — maybe 300 percent — endorse Karen Bass,” Watson told the Los Angeles Times.
Bass is running for election in California’s 33rd District, which is considered overwhelmingly Democratic and one of the most diverse in the state.
It is important for the candidates to be able to build broad coalitions in a district that has long been represented by African-Americans, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Bass is considered a strong favorite for the seat, with backing from Watson and L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.
“Karen’s abundant strengths as a public servant have always been her willingness and desire to listen carefully to the people she serves, coupled with her ability to act swiftly, forcefully and sensitively to meet the needs (of) her diverse constituents,” Ridley-Thomas told Fox.
Bass has held the position as state assembly speaker since 2004, but cannot seek re-election in the assembly when she steps down March 1. She is the first African-American woman to serve as state assembly speaker.
Five other political unknowns have begun the formal process to run for the House seat, according to the Los Angeles Times. The filing period closes March 12.

The USC Radisson hotel, home to a number of students, is currently undergoing major renovations.
Brand new · Construction on the lobby of the Radisson hotel on Figueroa Street has been underway since December. The work on the lobby, which is almost done, is part of phase one. - Gage Allard | Daily Trojan 
The Radisson, owned by the university and managed by USC Auxiliary Services, is being redone in an effort university officials hope will benefit students.
The three-phase project began in late 2008 with the openings of McKay’s restaurant and Rosso Oro’s Pizzeria and will continue at least through 2011.
Phase one includes the already completed restaurant renovations and resurfacing of the pool deck, as well as total renovations of the lobby, front desk area, gift shop, first floor hallway, elevator bank and the second floor banquet space.
In phase two, which will start in a few months, all the guest rooms will be redone.
Phase three will include the renovation of student rooms, which occupy four floors of the Radisson. Plans for this phase are still tentative, however.
The decision to update the hotel was a joint decision between Carlson and USC.
Teresa Shary, general manager of the Radisson and director of USC Auxiliary Services, said the goal of the changes is “improving the look of the Radisson and making it more contemporary.”
The pool has already been renovated, and the lobby and front desk area are currently undergoing a face-lift. Phase one will be finished by mid-March, according to Shary.
Phase two, which Shary regards as “exciting” and “fun,” involves renovations of the 138 guest rooms.
Renovations will be done floor by floor so the hotel can continue operating as usual. Shary expects the process will take about a year.
“A decision hasn’t been made beyond next year,” she said.
In the meantime, renovations have been planned to minimize the inconvenience to both students and guests, Shary said. Carlson and USC made sure major actions, such as the demolition of the lobby, took place while students were away.
The lobby was closed for a month after its demolition in December, but a temporary front desk and valet was set up by the hotel’s back entrance, so operations were largely unaffected.
Renovations on the second floor are currently underway and have rendered the student-only gym unavailable. The Radisson, however, is accommodating students and guests by designating hours for students to use the guest gym until the second floor is complete.
Students who live in the Radisson say they were most affected by the project at the beginning of the school year.
Jessie Wu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the renovations were slightly inconvenient.
“Elevators were sometimes off or broken,” she said. “We had to walk more.”
Wu said she eventually got used to it, however.
Will Ji, a freshman majoring in business administration, agreed.
“We thought it would be worse than it actually was,” he said.
Melinda Guillory, an undecided freshman and a Radisson resident, said, even though the “lobby was destroyed,” she hasn’t felt inconvenienced by the project, nor has she heard complaints from other residents.
Allen Tate, director of sales and marketing for the Radisson, said a majority of the Radisson’s business comes from campus, including parents, guest speakers and campus visitors. He is hoping students become aware of the renovations and will visit the Radisson more often.
There will be a grand re-opening of the renovated Radisson in March.
“I can’t tell you how excited I am about it,” Shary said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the Radisson hotel is owned by Carlson Hotels Worldwide. The hotel is actually owned by USC.

South L.A. residents voiced concern about proposed changes to bus prices and routes throughout the city at a Los Angeles Department of Public Transportation public hearing Wednesday.
The event, attended by about 15 community members, was held at the South Los Angeles Activity Center on South Figueroa Street. LADOT officials gave a presentation on service cuts and fare increases, and members of the audience shared their thoughts and concerns.
Phil Aker, an LADOT hearings officer, said, although this is the second public hearing out of four scheduled, LADOT has already received valuable input.
LADOT will soon need to make a decision on how to deal with its growing deficit. In July, it will be $23 million, and it is projected to grow to $350 million in the next decade.
“The bottom line is we’re operating more service right now than we can afford to pay for,” Aker said. “Ask yourself, if you have a number of bills to pay, do you cut back on services, do you decide what you can live without or do you just call up everyone and say, ‘Sorry, I can’t pay’?”
Aker said allowing community members to attend public hearings or submit comments and suggestions to LADOT through e-mail, telephone or mail is the department’s attempt to deal with this situation responsibly.
Community members who spoke out at the event were mainly concerned with using the LADOT system, like the Commuter Express, to commute to work and get their children to and from school.
One community member  who rides the Commuter Express 422 to the San Fernando Valley from South Los Angeles discussed the impact the proposed service cuts will have on individuals.
“We worry about the future. If LADOT and Commuter Express were to stop now … we have a big, bad situation. I recommend you think about our futures,” she said at the hearing.
Some community members, including John Young, also brought up the policy process and asked how receptive the city council will be to LADOT’s recommendations.
“What’s your personal feeling — that [city council] will do your recommendations the way you are requesting?” Young said.
An LADOT official responded by saying they are optimistic the city council will consider recommendations for public transportation funding but can’t be sure.
David Roberston, another community member, asked if LADOT had considered that some areas might have a greater need for public transportation.
“There’s affluent areas, then there’s areas like South Los Angeles, where you have more demands,” Robertson said. “When you look at the 15 council districts, do you see a greater demand for South L.A. … versus other parts of the city?”
An LADOT moderator responded that many communities have different circumstances and needs, implying that South Los Angeles is evaluated just like the other 14 districts.
Aker said LADOT has been working with a consulting firm to compile a transit service analysis by looking at how many people use specific services and routes, how much they pay and to what extent LADOT services are duplicate by other transportation services.
The transit analysis is proposing to cut a number of routes, including the Downtown Route C and Downtown Route DD. Aker said Dash Route F, which runs through North University Park, would not be eliminated or changed because of its popularity.
“We used to operate it every 15 minutes, we went to every 10 minutes because of increased ridership,” Aker said. “As L.A. Live came into being, we began to see more service [and activity] in that corridor.”
Any changes LADOT decides to make will go into effect July 1.
So why should I pay more for you to ride the bus? How about you paying your share on the bus ride?
Why not try and supplement budgetary deficiencies by imposing heightened taxes on vehicle owners instead of neglecting those who cannot afford to keep a car or are trying to reduce their energy consumption by using public transportation? Los Angeles already has one of the most pitiful public transportation systems in the world, but severe cutbacks on bus routes may very well place it at the bottom of the list.
The fact is, owning a car today is not only more expensive than ever, but awful for the environment and infrastructure. If stricter regulations, supplemented by improved national public transportation, are not imposed within the next few years, we will be seeing astronomical gas price hikes, and will be nowhere near prepared to make a smooth transition. There’s a reason why virttually every European and Canadian city has made an effort to strengthen metro systems, bike routes, pedestrian structures, etc.

Though the fall semester is just a mirage on the distant horizon for most students, a few are already looking ahead to November and the California elections.
“I don’t think people realize that November is not that far away. It’s really just around the corner from a campaign standpoint,” said Alexa Ekman, president of USC College Republicans.
Two important California contests will be decided this November — the race for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s office and Sen. Barbara Boxer’s bid for re-election.
Students at USC have recently begun throwing their support behind their favorite candidates. Two Silicon executives — both women — have already drawn organized student support.
Daniel Gabel, Los Angeles regional chair for Students for Meg Whitman, founded and co-chairs a chapter of the group at USC. The group supports the former eBay CEO, who is one of several Republican candidates for governor.
Ekman and Lauren Korbatov are co-chairing Carly Fiorina’s campus campaign group, USC Students for Carly, which started a few weeks ago. Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, is running against Boxer.
Ekman said many students don’t know who the candidates are at this point, and she thinks it is because the elections seem so far away.
She said she expects student involvement to heat up in April and May, but that it likely won’t reach the levels seen during the 2008 presidential election.
“For the presidential campaign, every student was wearing a pin, was volunteering,” Ekman said. “It was exciting to be involved, to take a position. Once this cycles back around again, there will be a resurgence in student activity but probably not to the same extent.”
Many students said they don’t know who the candidates are or where they stand on key issues.
Geovanni Juarez, a junior majoring in public relations, said he hasn’t been paying attention to the campaigns.
“I haven’t looked into it yet, I’m kind of in the dark,” Juarez said. “I’ve been busy with the start of the semester. As the election approaches I’ll obviously take a side.”
Stacy Jones, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said she hasn’t followed politics to this point, but she plans to start learning about the races soon.
“I don’t keep up with politics because I’ve never been able to vote,” she said. “I didn’t want to get involved and then get upset if I didn’t have the power to change things. Now that I can vote this year, I certainly plan to get involved.”
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said it’s too early to know whether the unprecedented student involvement in the 2008 campaign was the beginning of a general trend in student activism or an aberration. As a California state election, it is likely it won’t have such a marked manifestation on campus, since many students are registered to vote in their home states.
But Schnur emphasized that student activism is especially valuable to politicians during these elections.
“The vote from a 19- or 20-year-old counts just as much as the vote of a 50- or 60-year-old,” Schnur said. “And young people are much more likely to donate time volunteering. Finally, there’s great symbolic value in having the support of the next generation; it sends a message to all voters. So there’s statistical value, organizational value and a symbolic value for having students involved in a campaign.”
Both Students for Meg Whitman and USC Students for Carly are currently focusing on recruiting members and raising awareness about the groups’ respective candidates.
Gabel said Students for Meg Whitman has recruited about 30 members in the last few weeks and the group hopes to increase that number substantially this month. They will have a table on Trousdale Parkway next week.
“This month is all about recruiting, raising awareness about Meg’s campaign, finding people who are interested in becoming involved,” Gabel said. “[In] March [we] will shift to spreading her message and her platform, organizing events on campus, bringing in local politicians who support her, allowing students to become involved in the nitty gritty of the campaign, walking precincts, calling voters, etc.”
Students for Carly will also be hosting speakers, and Fiorina herself has already visited campus to speak with students. Ekman said the group is also planning to host forums.
“It’s a way for us to find out what [students] want or expect,” Ekman said. “We have to go out and educate young voters about why [Fiorina] is the best candidate for the United States Senate. Education of potential members and voters is going to be our main focus.”
So far, only Republican candidates have generated student groups on campus, but Schnur said it’s only a matter of time before groups will form in support of the Democratic candidates — specifically for Boxer and former California Governor Jerry Brown.
“Neither Boxer nor Brown has a primary challenge, so they’re able to start their campaigns a little more gradually,” Schnur said. “My guess is by fall you’ll see very sizable student groups for both parties’ nominees.”

Bicycle theft is on the rise in Los Angeles, but the trend seems to be reversed at USC.
Although officials say such crimes are actually becoming less common near the university, bicycle theft is still higher at USC than almost anywhere else in Los Angeles.
Nearly 2,000 bikes in the L.A. area were reported stolen last year — an all-time high in the city — and police suggest the number could be even higher because most people do not report stolen bikes. Reported bike thefts rose 29 percent last year and jumped 57 percent in the Downtown area.
But despite LAPD’s analysis, bike thefts in the USC area are actually decreasing.
“We have a decline in bike thefts over the past three years,” said David Carlisle, USC Department of Public Safety captain.
In 2009, the number of bike thefts reported to DPS dropped to 139 from 274 in 2008. In 2007, 337 bikes were reported stolen and 384 went missing in 2006.
Those numbers, however, might not be quite accurate. Carlisle said many bikes that are reported stolen are often lost, misplaced, borrowed or taken by friends.
DPS has been promoting many initiatives to decrease bike theft at USC.
“We need to take proactive steps to catch bike thieves,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle noted that most bike thefts occur in remote areas around campus when bikes are not locked up properly.
Students, however, said they’ve had bikes stolen even when they were locked and in public areas.
Katie Morris, a freshman majoring in critical studies, said a number of bikes have been stolen from the Radisson hotel where she lives.
“My roommate’s bike was stolen, my bike was stolen, my roommate’s new bike was stolen,” Morris said. “Our bikes were definitely locked, but DPS thinks they were taken around late afternoon. The bike rack is behind the Radisson right next to Figueroa [Street], so people can just load the bikes and drive away.”
Ashley Phillips, a freshman majoring in gerontology, said she had a similar experience.
“I came back after a party late one night and locked my bike in front of New/North but it was gone the next morning,” Phillips said. “I reported it to DPS, but they were never able to find it.”
DPS encourages students to take measures to safeguard their bikes.
“It is important not to leave bikes where they are vulnerable to theft,” Carlisle said.
This is especially important since some thieves even carry tool to destroy even the most expensive locks, Carlisle said.
He also said it is important for students to register their bikes with DPS, as it helps officers locate and return the bikes in a more efficient manner.
“With the cooperation of students registering early and listening to crime prevention advice and warnings, we have seen a significant decrease,” Carlisle said.
Use two bike locks – a U-lock and a cable lock.  Destroying both locks takes different tools.  Then, if they steal the bike, they probably worked long and hard enough to deserve it.
Nothing worse than getting your bike ripped!

The eight candidates running for Undergraduate Student Government executive office come from diverse backgrounds, but there is one thing they all have in common: They’re all male.
All the president’s men · A student casts his vote for Undergraduate Student Government president, vice president and senator at a voting station on Trousdale Parkway. Voting began Tuesday and ends Thursday. - Youli Zheng | Daily Trojan 
For the fifth year in a row, there are no female candidates on the ballot for USG president. In fact, this year, no women are in the running for either of USG’s top two positions.
The gender imbalance is more striking than in the past — last year there were two female candidates for vice president, including current vice president Ashlie Chan. But it is not entirely out of the ordinary. Although women make up more than half of the current USG executive and program boards, female candidates for the top position are rare.
Since spring 2006, none of the 18 candidates for USG president and only a third of the vice presidential candidates have been female. The last female candidate to run for president was Jessica Lall, who was elected in 2005.
“Personally, I was very surprised to go to the first candidates’ meeting and see that there were no women running for president or vice president,” said presidential candidate Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, a junior majoring in theatre.
Berit Elam,  executive director of the Women’s Student Assembly, said that, although women are well-represented in student government and other organizations, they tend to shy away from the top position.
“I’m a little let down by some of the strong female leaders on campus that I know exist because I know they would be great,” Elam said. “Maybe ‘let down’ is too harsh, but it would be nice to see some of the amazing female leaders we have on campus step into that role.”
It’s not that women aren’t involved in USG. Five of the eight members of this year’s executive cabinet are female. But for some reason, they are not pursuing the presidential position.
“Women tend to be more involved in student government, so it’s kind of ironic,” said presidential candidate Dylan Dann, a junior majoring in international relations (global business).
Both women and men involved in USG were quick to say they believed the lack of female executive candidates this year was coincidental and not the result of any sort of bias.
“All you have to do is look at the legislative field and every residential senator that’s running is female, so I do think it’s really a coincidence,” said Andrew Matson, a junior presidential candidate majoring in political science and international relations. “I don’t think there’s any institutional bias.”
Some said the barriers keeping female candidates from running for office might be more individual than institutional.
Presidential candidate Chris Cheng, a junior majoring in international relations, said he had “no insight” into the disparity, adding that he considered female running mates when planning his ticket.
“I could believe there’s a subconscious trend, just because it hasn’t been done [recently],” he said.
The underrepresentation of women in student government is not limited to USC.
In 2006, a study at American University in Washington, D.C. found that women made up 62 percent of the student body but less than a third of the student government.
American University’s Women & Politics Institute created Campaign College, a program designed to encourage and train female college students to run for student government office.
The institute also examined the reasons women don’t seek high political office. Some of those reasons, such as family responsibilities, don’t usually apply to college students, but Ava Lubell, the political director of the institute, said women of all ages are less likely to see themselves as good candidates.
A study by the institute found that men are almost two-thirds more likely than women to see themselves as qualified to run, and a third more likely to consider entering politics.
Lubell said women, unlike men,  often need to be encouraged to participate in the political process.
“Women need to be asked to run,” she said. “They’re less likely to perceive themselves as being recruited, so you need to say explicitly, ‘We think you should run.’”
Students involved with USG seemed wary of specifically recruiting women to run for top positions.
“I’m not sure what USG could really do in terms of recruiting people. If someone wants to run, it’s their prerogative to run,” Matson said.
Elam worried such efforts could do more harm than good.
“I think it would have negative results if a female candidate won because she was recruited by USC,” she said.
Some student voters said they were surprised there were no female candidates.
“I think a girl should go for it,” said Rachel Porter, a sophomore majoring in piano performance.
Branche Foston, a junior majoring in communication, hypothesized that women might be choosing not to run because they have other commitments.
“Girls are involved with way more things than guys are,” Foston said.
Some voters, however, did not notice that women were missing from the presidential ballot.
“It didn’t even really occur to me,” said Julien Kacou, a junior majoring in political science and history.
Elam said she is not sure why there isn’t at least one female candidate on any of this year’s tickets.
“As far as running a smart campaign, I don’t know why more candidates didn’t pick women,” Bertram said. “I think it was really intelligent how the [Holden Slusher-Ashlie Chan] campaign was run because it appealed to a broader group of students.”
Matson said the lack of women was “not for lack of trying.”
“Without disclosing names, I can assure you that females were contacted,” he said.
Munoz-Proulx said he thought part of the reason for the gender disparity might be that men choose other men as their running mates.
“Most men, in our society, they’re closer friends with other men,” he said. “So it’s not too surprising that a lot of guys have chosen other guys to run with.”
Matson said he thinks the composition of next year’s USG candidates will be more balanced.
“Next year, it could be all female candidates,” he said. “I’d be willing to wager money that there will be at least one.”
Though there is nothing stopping women from running, Maya Babla, a junior majoring in communication and public diplomacy who ran for vice president last year, said it could be a while before women are consistently running for president.
“I don’t think there’s any barrier to pursuing whatever we want, but I do think it will take time to reach equality in numbers,” Babla said. “I would love to see more female candidates. I think that there is a difference in male and female candidates, in that a woman brings something different to the table.”
