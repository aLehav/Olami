Reduce, reuse, recycle: the mantra of our childhoods. One trifecta of alliteration taught us everything we need to know about environmentalism, or did it? 
I ask because I don’t actually see a lot of reducing and reusing. We’re big on the recycling, but the alliterative ideal of environmentalism ends there. It makes sense. Why should we alter our daily lives when we can just toss everything into a recycling bin, the environmentalist equivalent of the Catholic confessional?
Some company promises it’ll hop in the ocean and wrestle my forgotten plastic straws from a poor sea turtle and recycle them into something new. What a delightful deus ex machina to the doom and gloom of climate change. 
Allbirds offers a $100 pair of sneakers made from recyclable materials. Neat! Pharrell wants to make textiles from plastic waste. Even better! For every asphyxiated sea turtle, there’s a new startup that promises to sell us a piece of the green revolution. Problem solved! Climate change fixed! We can all go home!
Except we can’t. To begin with, there’s not actually enough recyclable plastic to go around. In the United States, less than 30% of all plastic bottles are recycled. As more and more companies hop on the recycling bandwagon, this already-diminished supply becomes even more scarce. 
These upcycling sustainable fashion brands are particularly problematic because while a water bottle made of recycled plastic can continue to be recycled, the clothing pieces made from these recyclable materials will only end up back in a landfill. If we could increase recycling rates across the world, this would certainly increase the amount of plastic available to be upcycled into new goods and materials, but here’s the hard truth we’re avoiding: Recycling is not enough. 
There’s no way around the fact that 91% of plastic items globally aren’t recycled. Even if recycling rates increase, plastic can’t be recycled indefinitely. Moreover, plastic is manufactured from crude oil, creating carbon emissions, and a single plastic water bottle remains on the planet for 450 years or more. That’s right. Four hundred fifty years. Four hundred fifty years ago America wasn’t even a country!
We need to radically reduce our consumption and rethink our consumer habits. 
In 2008, an MIT study found that even Americans with the lowest energy usage still use more than double the global per-capita carbon emission. There’s no way around the fact that our lifestyles are wildly unsustainable. 
Meanwhile, companies can easily sway favor by promoting themselves as sustainable and emphasizing their use of recyclable materials, but our choices don’t exist in a bubble, and these so-called sustainable products are often not as environmentally friendly as we want. Think back to that upcycled piece of clothing that will simply end up in a landfill.
But what about reusing? Let’s think about that sea turtle choking on your plastic straw from Starbucks that you used despite the strawless lid — yes, I see you. He need not suffer now that we have reusable straws. Go free, turtle! Breathe! Reuse is surely a flawless part of the trifecta? 
Again, no, because our idea of reusing has become wildly counterintuitive. Think about the drawer of ever-accumulating Tupperware in your kitchen. Yes, it’s certainly better to use reusable containers than single-use plastic, but that doesn’t mean you can just keep buying and buying reusable containers into oblivion. All plastic has a price.
When reusable plastics become a trend, they defeat their own purpose. Look at Starbucks. They regularly release seasonal reusable cups. Celebrate Halloween with a spooky cobweb-themed plastic cup. Toss it in your cupboard, and two weeks later you can buy Christmas-themed plastic cups: one for hot drinks and one for cold, of course. 
The entire purpose of a reusable cup is to reuse it. If you buy one for every major holiday, you might as well just go back to single-use plastic. It is great that environmentalism has entered the mainstream consciousness, but the more popular it becomes, the more businesses and people seek to use the label of sustainability to make a quick buck.
Be wary of companies that preach sustainability but may not actually act on it. Do your research. 
Reduce, reuse, recycle but remember recycling is a last resort and not an end-all, cure-all to our environmental issues. Reduce, reuse, recycle but remember the purpose of reuse is still to reduce consumption. Reduce, reuse, recycle but mostly, reduce.

When English majors are asked what they’re majoring in, these questions inevitably come up: “What are you going to do with an English degree? Does that mean you want to be a novelist? Where’s the money in that?” However, a lack of financial stability may not be so debilitating after all, and while some English majors may take the publishing route, this is not their only post-college option. In fact, there are plenty of opportunities for English-degree holders. 
The number of English majors nationally is down 25.5%, a figure on the rise since 2008. As students turn away from the humanities, more and more are entering popular fields like computer science and engineering. There is unsupported post-grad fear attached to fields such as English or literature. Humanities majors question their post-college careers and whether they can support themselves. Should they take such a large risk when there are more stable majors leading to lucrative careers? 
Interestingly, the National Center for Education Statistics found in 2017 that unemployment was actually lower among 25- to 29-year-old English majors than it was for math and computer science majors. And although pay inequality exists between STEM majors and humanities majors upon graduation, pay evens out with time. By middle age, the pay is fairly equal across degrees, with those in the humanities field given greater opportunities to earn leadership positions. 
On a broader level, it’s important to realize why humanities majors are so vital. After all, English majors aren’t just trained to write novels. They’re storytellers. They’re taught to think critically and carefully, to analyze human behavior and make sense of it. They are clear communicators, intelligent contributors and problem solvers. And this kind of storytelling — making sense of data and finding creative ways of presenting complex information — requires the kind of skills needed not only for humanities careers but for many fields.
For instance, in Australia, bankers and economists are looking to writers to tell the story of inflation. They want to better connect with the public through what they call “narrative economics.” Speechwriters are called upon to create stories that help executives, administrators and politicians deliver relatable and affecting remarks. Scientists need writers to interpret their findings and present them with clarity and precision. Marketing is all about crafting the story of a particular brand or business. Media and film allow storytellers to create rich and complex narratives audiences will identify with. 
With a growing need for storytellers, what better time to study English than now, and what better place than here? The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences is the largest school at USC, encompassing nearly 40% of the class of 2023. Dornsife boasts a thriving English program, offering emphases in literature and creative writing. 
No matter the route, English majors at USC have the great pleasure of taking courses spanning medieval to the modern, poetry to creative nonfiction, with professors who are deeply invested in students’ progress as writers and thinkers. With small classes that build a collaborative and interactive atmosphere, the English major allows students to learn from distinguished faculty as well as participate directly in complex discussions and pose questions of ethics, morality and identity. 
The program feels like a true cohort, a group of curious and driven students who go through classes together, getting to know each other’s work, critiquing and bettering their writing and learning how to apply what they have learned. As the USC English department puts it, “Job skills through stories? — yes.”
Though an English or a humanities major may not present the clearest path to success or the surest way to a career, this is equally as beautiful. There is joy in knowing the world is at our fingertips. The next time someone inquires about your major or implies you have taken a wrong turn, convince them otherwise. Show them the data. Better yet, tell them a story.

The No. 9-ranked USC women’s soccer team is advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament after defeating No. 22 Texas A&M 2-1 Friday and No. 20 Santa Clara 1-0 in the Sweet 16 Sunday.  
“I like the intensity and effort that we gave,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the win over Santa Clara. “I thought we raised our level today knowing the importance of the game.” 
Junior forward Tara McKeown returned against Texas A&M after missing two games with a knee injury to score the game’s first goal in the seventh minute.
Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking scored a second goal for the Trojans in the 33rd minute, and that ended up being all they needed. Redshirt senior midfielder Natalie Jacobs assisted both of USC’s goals. 
Texas A&M only found the back of the net once in the second half even though it sent a flurry of shots at the USC defense. The Aggies put up 21 shots compared to USC’s nine, but redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins made seven saves — including multiple impressive stops with the game on the line toward the end of the match. 
On Sunday, the Trojans handed Santa Clara its first shutout loss of the year in a physical and intense Sweet 16 battle.
The Broncos headed into the game with a strong regular season resume that saw them upset No. 7 UCLA and tie No. 4 BYU in double overtime. 
However, USC proved to be too much for them to handle as a stellar defensive outing limited Santa Clara’s scoring opportunities.  
“We didn’t get too caught up in the energy and excitement of the game,” McAlpine said. “We stayed focused and played through the physicality.”
Graduate defender Natalie Ward scored the game-winning goal for the Trojans in the 41st minute. After a long corner was sent back toward midfield, Ward perfectly struck a long volley that put the Trojans up for good. 
The goal was the first of Ward’s collegiate career, which included three seasons with Notre Dame.
“I’m speechless,” Ward said after the game. “I couldn’t be more proud of this group of girls and how far we’ve made it.”
After the goal, the Trojans took control of the game, dominating the time of possession and keeping the ball in Santa Clara’s half of the field. Still, USC could not find a second goal to put the game away, missing a number of close opportunities in agonizing fashion: The team hit the crossbar on three separate occasions in the second half. 
Santa Clara had a huge header opportunity with 12 minutes remaining, but the shot went wide right and the Broncos were unable to get off any more good looks. 
McAlpine credited USC’s experience and its tough regular season schedule with the team’s ability to perform under pressure late. 
“Our schedule was filled with teams that compete, and so we’re battle-tested,” McAlpine said. “We made some mistakes along the way in a handful of games, and we showed today that we learned from those.”
The win was especially meaningful for Ward, as it extended her college career another game. After missing her senior year at Notre Dame with an injury, Ward decided to transfer to USC as a graduate to gain a fifth year of NCAA eligibility. 
She has been a vital part of the defensive rotation this season, as she has started 12 games for the Trojans, but her offense made the difference Sunday.  
“I left it all out on the field today,” Ward said. “If we can bring the same intensity and mentality to every single game from here on out, we can go ahead and win this whole thing.”
Although USC was able to pull out another huge playoff win, it came at a cost. Late in the second half, Hocking went down in pain and later required stitches in her knee. Redshirt junior forward Samantha Bruder, who has played 15 games this year, had to be helped off the field after a collision.
The Trojans will hope to have both players ready to go in the Elite Eight against No. 2 North Carolina, which has only lost once all season. 
A win against the Tar Heels would send USC to the Final Four for the first time since 2016. The game will start at 3 p.m. Friday in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Earlier this year, as nearly every column I wrote had something to do with the Academy Awards, I realized the obvious: Movies are very personal. We think we leave our lives at home when we go to the movies, but I don’t think so. I think we take our problems, anxieties, our triumphs and defeats, into the theater, hoping that whatever is projected before us does not make us forget ourselves but makes us feel seen and understood. 
Even movies that we think exist purely to entertain are beloved because they appeal to our personalities and our ways of seeing the world. In writing about the Academy Awards, I realized that what the Academy says is “good” does not matter. At the end of the day, they are just people who bring their own experiences to the movies; they like and dislike movies just like us — they just have a better platform for speaking their mind. 
Since then, I would like to think I emphasized the personal dimension of watching movies more than anything in my column. And, to conclude its first year, I decided to follow through on my conviction by letting others speak up about their favorite movies of the decade.
Below are writers and editors from the Daily Trojan whom I admire both for their technical writing prowess and their sheer enthusiasm for the work. I’ve had the pleasure of working with most of them for nearly an entire year, and each one has inspired me in a different way. Not all of them write about movies, but I don’t care — their opinions are as valid as any member of the Academy. 
That’s why I told them not to write about what they think is the “best” movie of the decade or the most “important” — whatever that means. I told them to write about their favorite film of the decade, the one that they had the best experience with and that meant the most to them. My goal in compiling their answers is not only to offer a break from the sea of monotonous critics’ lists you’ll see in the coming months but to emphasize, once again, that the most important issue when considering any movie is not what critics or voting bodies think but how your neighbor felt about it. 
This isn’t my last column, but it’s my last as the arts & entertainment editor for the Daily Trojan. I don’t see a better way to conclude my year editing at the paper than by doing what I’ve been doing all along — letting the writers write about what they love.
“The Social Network” — Eileen Toh, digital managing editor
It could be assumed that at Facebook’s inception, Mark Zuckerberg would have more friends than anyone, but “The Social Network” (2010) proves viewers wrong. Starring Jesse Eisenberg as the Facebook CEO in what may be his most iconic role, the film unveils the rocky basis on which the social network was founded. 
The film provides softball critiques of Zuckerberg’s character though somehow convinces viewers that men with oversized intellect who are not afraid to disguise their insecurities with narcissism — which came to embody the “tech-bro culture” that is heavily concentrated in the Bay Area — emerge as the clear winners. 
Nearly shot as a daylight-horror movie, with Zuckerberg and booted cofounder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) facing off amid Zuckerberg’s betrayal following Facebook’s success, “The Social Network” serves as the ominous prelude to Facebook’s notoriety as a social network that has enabled false news and hate speech, not to mention the Cambridge Analytica scandal that sent the company spiraling. 
“Blue Jasmine” — Anton Vayedjian, A&E staff writer
If there’s one thing I expect from a Woody Allen picture, it’s characters that enthrall from the get-go. Their witticism is unparalleled. They’re wildly clever, often too intelligent for their own good, and I think that’s what makes them so endearing.
“Blue Jasmine” (2013) chronicles the story of socialite Jasmine Francis, played by the remarkable Aussie American thespian Cate Blanchett. Once married to a wealthy, New York City con artist and womanizer (Alec Baldwin), she now finds herself crashing at her estranged sister’s (Sally Hawkins) apartment. Suffice to say, Blanchett delivers not only her greatest performance but perhaps one of the best performances of the last decade. 
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get a kick out of her compulsive quirks and pretenses on every rewatch. Allen captures the contempt that the “bourgeoisie” has for everyone else. But what sets this picture apart more than anything else is all of the ugliness that comes with the loss of a woman’s livelihood. It’s a classic riches-to-rags story — except it isn’t.
“About Time” — Natalie Oganesyan, A&E editor
Anyone who knows me knows that I’m somehow both a cynic and a hopeless romantic at once. I watch romantic dramas and comedies with a zeal that is unparalleled by most: I can’t help it — I’m a sucker for a good love story (even ones that are told badly). That’s why “About Time” (2013), a movie I first watched five years ago, which I think about constantly and rewatch to this day, is my favorite movie of the decade.
“About Time” tells a love story that’s warped and transformed by time and mistakes. It all begins when Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) spends a fateful summer at his parents’ house and learns from his father James (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family can travel through time. So, Lake sets out on a journey to improve his love life.
The film, while criticized for its plot holes regarding time travel (but, let’s be honest, which movie has tied up loose ends when it comes to the space-time continuum?) is endearing and powerful. 
It taught me some of the most powerful lessons I know and stick to now: One, when we truly love, we love deeply enough to sacrifice ourselves for someone else; two, try as we might, we cannot outrun time — it catches up to us all, three, life is meant to be lived, complete with all its sorrows, joys, triumphs and losses.
“Inside Out” — Finn Kobler, A&E staff writer
Nobody tells a story like Pixar — that’s gospel truth at this point. What makes a film like “Inside Out” (2015) soar above even the best Pixar works, however, is how nuanced its storytelling is. To set the premise of a story inside the brain of a tween girl is a bold task that runs the risk of being gimmicky. But “Inside Out” is so much more. It glides over the hazardous chasms of crude contrivance and, by refusing to take the easy way out, lets itself shine as arguably the most poignant, clever and (appropriately) emotional adventure film ever made. 
When the characters Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) must find a way home to save Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), the girl they live inside, they could have easily been forced to battle vague “enemies” that exist within the human mind. A lesser writer could have easily scrapped major research and cheaply homaged “Indiana Jones” or “Jaws” by making the big bad guy a medulla oblongata axe pendulum or a broadly sketched “nightmare monster.” 
“Inside Out” isn’t written by lesser writers though. Its characters enter all sorts of erudite and psychologically accurate lion’s dens. In abstract thought, they have to find a way to navigate out of the decay from “nonobjective fragmentation” to “deconstruction” to “nonfigurative.” 
In “Inside Out,” Joy and Sadness learn from each other. They balance one another. Their combined strength defeats the real antagonist of the film: depression. It’s hidden masterfully, but in the end, Riley’s inability to feel Joy and Sadness cause her to feel nothing at all, which is a deeply relatable and — prior to this film — hardly talked about issue in children. “Inside Out” reminds kids and parents alike that there are no right or wrong ways to feel or remember things. It’s one of those movies that, if seen at the right time, can help kids go from lost to well-adjusted. I wish it came around when I was 11.
“Creed” — Eduardo Ocampo, A&E staff writer
“Creed” (2015) transcends the boxing film genre with its focus on the father-son story. What appears to be resentment for a father who Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) never met is revealed to be fear: fear of letting down a father’s legacy. Johnson’s moment of catharsis comes through the line that makes me tear up everytime: “Let me finish. I gotta prove it … I’m not a mistake.” As someone who recognizes the sacrifices my dad had to make to move to this country and raise me and my sisters, the thought of living up to our parents’ expectations can be taxing. After that line, in which the iconic “Rocky” theme blares, he’s accepted his father is a part of the legacy that he’s trying to forge for himself. 
My love for “Creed” has gotten to the point where when I’m watching it, I recite the lines before they’re even spoken. 
As Donnie aids Rocky (who can no longer take a step without pain) in walking up the iconic steps of the first “Rocky” film, both the old and the new take a moment of reflection. They are at a point in their lives where they’ve accepted themselves. And it was at that moment that I realized that “Creed” would be a movie I’d rewatch for years to come.
“La La Land” — Anmol Bajpai, A&E staff writer
“Here’s to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem.” This iconic line from the character Mia (Emma Stone)’s emotionally climactic song “Audition (the fools who dream)” captures why “La La Land” (2016) is so special to so many people, including me. Damien Chazelle’s modern classic takes place in the grandeur of Los Angeles where two young dreamers, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia , have big ambitions to follow what they are passionate about.
A talented pianist, Sebastian wants to have his own successful jazz club while Mia wants to be a Hollywood actress in big movies one day. When they’re drawn together and fall in love, the film combines jazz music and classic Hollywood to create an infectious musical spectacle in the vein of “Singin’ in the Rain.” All of these elements are a perfect recipe for a film Hollywood critics and fans would eat up, but “La La Land” has something else that makes it a true zeitgeist film when it came out in the end of 2016. 
I think that’s because “La La Land” wasn’t concerned with extravagant dance choreography or grandiose musical numbers or even worried about the love story between the leads. No, “La La Land” is a film about and for the ones who dream, no matter what those dreams may be. This film spoke to me at a very poignant point in my life as I was finishing senior year of high school. I had to make my own decision to let go of things close to me — friendships, home, love — to chase my dreams far away. That’s how “La La Land” connects with people — it makes them fall in love with their dreams again.  
“The Florida Project” — Natalie Bettendorf, associate managing editor.
My favorite movie of the decade has to be Sean Baker’s “The Florida Project” (2017). This film is an absolute masterpiece that got less recognition than it deserved. It is perfectly imperfect — the improvisation, the amateurs cast from Instagram and everyday interactions, the colors. I watched this film a second time with my parents right before the 2018 Oscars. It extracts what I love the most about children, which is their boundless imagination and their ability to turn the most mundane space into a fairytale land. It articulates the humanity of poverty and teen motherhood in a beautifully heartbreaking way. 
The scene where the 6-year-old star Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and her adolescent mother (Bria Vinaite) are together, being kids and reminding the audience of their youth despite their adult circumstances, are the points of the film that are still ingrained in me: spinning Moonee in the shopping cart of a dollar store, squealing at fireworks on the Fourth of July and, the biggest tear-jerker, the two of them spinning in the rain in the middle of a field. Watching the rain scene with my own mother multiplied my emotional attachment to the film and gave me an indescribable ache toward growing up in a cruel world. This film is everything I could ask from a cinematic experience.
“Call Me By Your Name” — Christina Tiber, A&E food columnist
“Call Me By Your Name” (2017) is a nostalgic movie, but not the kind of in-your-face, pastiche-overload nostalgia we’ve become accustomed to in this decade. Instead, the film showcases a subtle kind of nostalgia — the fruit was sweeter, the summers were warmer, the love was unconditional. Through gentle direction and nuanced performances, Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver’s (Armie Hammer) romance quickly became iconic, not only for the LGBT+ community but also for anyone who has ever experienced all-consuming love and heartbreak. From the saccharine establishing shots of lush Italy to the expertly written dialogue, to the profoundly cathartic ending, I can’t help but watch this movie over and over, wishing for my own sunny villa somewhere in northern Italy.
“First Reformed” — Kabir Malhotra, A&E staff writer
My pick for movie of the decade has to be “First Reformed” (2018). Written and directed by Paul Schrader, it tells the story of Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) who works at First Reformed Baptist Church and his ongoing crisis of faith in the face of climate change. It’s the kind of film that is so obviously great, even upon first watch — the Bresson-esque directing, rich, layered script, show-stopping performance from Hawke and the beautiful cinematography. More than all, though, the thing that I love so much about “First Reformed” is the existential, jaw-clenching fear it conjured up inside of me. 
I’d argue that the scariest movie I’ve ever seen isn’t a horror movie — it’s “First Reformed.” It’s pervaded by this overwhelming sense of dread, disillusionment and powerlessness — the feeling of knowing the world is ending, watching it happen and unsure if you or any of the institutions you place faith in can help with it. The first time I watched it, I literally had to pause the movie and take a break because I became so terrified. But Schrader allows for a hopeful ending. Up until the final scene, the camera never moves, allowing images to flutter in and out of the screen. But in its final moments it glides and spins around two characters in a carnal embrace, facing the despair of the world and combating it the only way possible — through love. 
“If Beale Street Could Talk” — Ellice Ellis, A&E music columnist
Love, Black Harlem and the ’70s not only top the list of my favorite things but are the bricks that “If Beale Street Could Talk” (2018) are built on. Barry Jenkins’ adaptation of the James Baldwin classic brought intimacy, better yet, Black intimacy to life. 
Growing up, I wanted perfect love stories, ones without the heartbreak of suffering — but this film isn’t that. There are hours of television and cinema that reckon Black love and family with social ills, but Beale Street is different. It’s shot softly, it’s touching and the story of Fonny (Stephan James) and Tish (KiKi Layne) is poignantly real without gimmicks or dialogue plucked from social media. 
If a film with a storyline imbued with profound tragedy can make a person want to experience love despite its risks, it deserves accolades and praise for years to come.

A singer, songwriter and producer from Arizona — this is the triple threat that has just hit the spotlight. Tyler Simpson, a sophomore majoring in business administration, started making beats when he was in eighth grade.  
Simpson came up with his stage name, Nemo Lakes, from distinct childhood memories about getting lost and living by a lake, which have stuck with him since.
“Nemo is because when I was a kid, I got lost at a waterpark during a field trip, and I guess my teacher called me Nemo, and it kind of stuck on,” Simpson said. “A lot of my friends, when I was a kid, would call me Nemo. Then Lakes — I grew up on a lake, and I thought it was a fitting name, and it sounded kind of cool.”
With no music lessons or training, Simpson taught himself all he needed to know about music and the art of making beats, while writing lyrics that represent his life experiences.
“I’ve definitely had a lot of self-doubt or self-pondering and wondering about different things and during this transitionary period of life, I guess that all the different thoughts I’ve had about myself and about everything around me I kind of formed into my music,” Simpson said. “I’d say there’s definitely very much a self-empowerment or self-belief element in my music.”
 When songs contain meaningful words that spark emotion from listeners it makes it easier for people to connect with it. Simpson’s music contains messages of self-worth and never giving up on what you desire.
“The message that I would be trying to send out is really believe in yourself and your self-worth and do what you want to do. Follow what you really believe in. I’d say that’s really the main message behind all of it,” Simpson said. “I believe very much in being yourself and not trying to conform to other people’s beliefs and society’s real metrics.”
If Simpson does not have an initial gut feeling about a song he has created, he will stop working on it. For him, it is important to be proud of the music he makes and confident in what he puts out.
“When I usually make a song that I like, I’ll get this feeling,” Simpson said. “I’ll feel it in my gut or feel it in my chest, like, ‘OK, this is super cool.’ I just recently, like probably two weeks ago, just made the first song that I felt like that since [my first album] ‘Lakes’ and really it took me four or five months after I finished ‘Lakes’ to come up with another song because I didn’t really like any of the music that I made after that.”
Jalen Stokes, Simpson’s fraternity brother and publicist, has known Simpson for a year and met him through their fraternity. As his publicist, Stokes helps Simpson with organizing and deciding what shows to play, as well as who may be interested in interviewing Simpson to get him exposure.
“I think for him, as an artist, he’s progressed,” said Stokes, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “Not just, ‘Oh, I’m going to just put out music and see what happens to it.’ He’s really trying to create a fan base and really trying to tap in with media and do shows and how can he grow as an artist. I’ve seen that with him happen in the last few months.”
Simpson took a break from music but is now ready to play shows live again and share unique and vibrant content that he has written with listeners who can relate to those words. He is able to create a wide variety of types of music that allow listeners to be transported to a different time.
“Tyler’s different because there’s no box you can put him in,” Stokes said. “Even looking at his inspirations also, his actual music, each track is slightly different than the other. Like there is a song where I feel like I’m listening to rock, like a rock album, from the 1980s, ’90s and then there’s other songs that make me feel like I’m on the beach, and I’m just watching waves pass by … He also does it all: He writes, he produces and he sings, so a lot of people either do one or maybe two out of those three, but he does all of it.”
Ryan Fischer, a sophomore majoring in music production, has known Simpson for a year, but they only recently began bonding over their love for music. Fischer assists Simpson in producing and creating the tracks that he envisions.
“[Simpson] is just super genuine in his music and his personality. As a person, he’s a super genuine person,” Fischer said. “A lot of artists want to put on a persona or a brand and strive for some kind of — there’s some element of putting on a mask. With a lot of artists they want to put on a character and Tyler, to a certain extent, puts on a character for his audience but he’s one of the most genuine dudes I’ve ever met. His passion for the music is so real.”
Although he does not wish to be a very prominent artist, Simpson does aspire to have a core group of fans who support him and are able to connect with his music.
“Since the last project that I did, it’s been pretty quiet from my end in terms of output and everything,” Simpson said. “It has been a lot of personal development and musical development and I’m really, really, really excited for the stuff I’m going to put out starting next year.”

USC football has been heading for a head coaching change ever since the team’s embarrassing 56-24 home defeat to the Oregon Ducks a few weeks ago. At the time, the Trojans were 5-4, and no matter how the rest of the season went, it seemed like the right time to move on from Clay Helton and bring in a staff that could help the considerable talent on this roster reach true contender status.
While I still believe that is the correct course of action, something about Saturday’s 52-35 victory over UCLA complicates the coaching matter just a bit.
That something is Kedon Slovis, who shattered the program records for both passing yards in a season by a freshman and single-game passing yards by any quarterback in a sterling 515-yard, four-touchdown performance. Slovis was absolutely lights out, putting the pressure on UCLA’s offense by guiding the Trojans to an early lead and responding with scores every time the Bruins mounted a comeback attempt.
Saturday’s game continued the trend of Slovis putting up monstrous numbers — and not just for a freshman. Over his final five games this season, Slovis averaged 404.6 passing yards and 3.8 touchdowns per game while completing over 70% of his pass attempts. If there were fantasy football for the college game, Slovis’ home stretch would have won the league for many of his owners.
USC fans have obviously loved what they’ve seen from the once-unheralded three-star recruit, but there’s a small discrepancy between their future hopes for Slovis and their demand that the University move on from Helton. If USC elects to hire a new head coach, he will almost definitely want to bring on a whole new staff, including an offensive coordinator to replace Graham Harrell.
To protect Slovis’ seemingly definitive status as a star to rely on for the next three years, USC should do whatever it can to avoid this result. Harrell has been a huge factor in Slovis’ success. The freshman quarterback has said so himself, crediting Harrell’s scheme (and his teammates) for his big numbers.
Slovis is the perfect signal-caller for Harrell’s modified Air Raid approach. He almost always makes good decisions, so he can sling the ball more than 50 times without risking too many turnovers. He’s also got fantastic accuracy and knows how to find his receivers in positions for them to make plays with the ball.
The crazy thing is that due to the attack’s execution-based nature, Slovis is only going to get better over time. He’s had a few freshman mistakes where he tried to force the ball between defenders, but that’s something he can iron out.
Remember that Slovis didn’t even get the first-team reps until after sophomore JT Daniels went down with a knee injury in the team’s opener. Imagine what he can do with a full spring and fall camp as well as a season of experience under his belt.
This is why USC cannot afford to get rid of Harrell. The relationship between an offensive coordinator and their quarterback is crucial to a team’s performance, and the Trojans have found one that works — really well. Slovis has shown he can be one of the best quarterbacks in school history, but we don’t know what he looks like with someone else calling the shots.
I’m not going to claim that Slovis couldn’t look just as good under some other offensive coordinator. He has talent that most evaluators obviously missed in the recruiting process. From mental processing to arm talent, Slovis has looked close to the total package these last few games. But we know that he works with Harrell, and that’s not something USC should mess with.
Harrell isn’t necessarily a perfect offensive coordinator either. He sometimes gives up on the run game a little too easily, and Saturday was the first time the Trojans could really make a team pay for dropping eight by running the ball effectively. 
Even with the injuries at running back, it shouldn’t have taken that long to develop a complementary run game. But it’s also important to remember that Harrell is young and coaching his first season in a Power 5 conference. Just like Slovis, he’s had a fantastic first season, and he’s only going to get better.
USC now has a delicate tightrope to walk. It needs to bring on a new head coach so that it can reach its rightful aspirations as a College Football Playoff contender. It needs a head coach who not only inspires devotion from his players, as Helton does, but spurs them on to new levels of play. It also needs an improved defensive staff, as evidenced by the 35 points allowed to a seemingly unstoppable UCLA offense Saturday.
The University must balance that requirement with the priority of holding onto Harrell. It needs to find an inspired coaching candidate — no, not Urban Meyer — that will be willing to retain and work with Harrell and his crew.
The Trojans have something special on their hands. It’s rare to have two key pieces of your team be so productive and yet have so much room to grow. It’s even rarer for those two pieces to fit perfectly together. It’s been an encouraging end to the season, but if Harrell doesn’t return next year, the offense will enter the 2020 season opener against Alabama with more questions than answers.

After an agonizing half-hour wait for Conquest’s headliner, the crowd roared to life when rapper and USC alumna Saweetie sauntered on stage, later accompanied by her partner and fellow rapper Quavo. 
Despite a last-minute change of lineup, the hybrid concert, pep rally and carnival held annually the week of USC’s football game against rival UCLA, brought students to McCarthy Quad Thursday night. 
Although her set was scheduled to begin at 10 p.m., Saweetie didn’t take the stage until 10:25 p.m. She came out to the title track from her 2018 EP, “High Maintenance.” Everything she wore was royal purple: her fur coat, bell-bottom pants, platform heels, sequin and velvet bra, eye shadow and wide hoop earrings.
Leading up to the main acts, this year’s event broke barriers by showcasing a performance by Angel Dust, a USC drag queen who recently performed at the Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s 10th annual drag show “House of Troy.”
After USC Concerts Committee announced Wednesday that rapper Rico Nasty couldn’t headline this year’s Conquest due to personal reasons, it announced 2016 Annenberg alumna Saweetie would perform instead.
“It was really, really touch-and-go for the last 48 hours, and there was a lot of stress and anxiety,” Concerts Committee codirector Chris Begler said. “But I am nothing but elated with the way [codirector] Leila [Kashfi] and I handled ourselves and most importantly with the way our team handled ourselves.”
Though doors for the event opened at 5 p.m., the opening act Channel Tres, didn’t go on until 8:50 p.m. When he did go on, he sported his signature rolled beanie in light blue with a cardigan that he promptly shed as he launched into his set.
“Yo, my name is Channel Tres, I hail from Compton, California, what’s cracking?” he asked the audience.
Tres did not let technical difficulties hold him back from delivering a solid show. His vocals were quiet for a significant portion of his set, but his groovy, uptempo songs were infectious enough to get the crowd dancing. He was accompanied by two dancers, and together the trio executed choreography to every track.
Tres’s 45-minute set remained engaging throughout by incorporating crowd participation, a visual for his song “Topdown” and a stream-of-consciousness-style freestyle during which he faced away from the audience.
“I thought the set was really dope. It was really unexpected,” said Jaryn Valdry, a sophomore majoring in communication. “I didn’t listen to Channel Tres before I came, but I really like his vibe, and the bounce in his music just made it really fun.” 
After the crown chanted Saweetie’s name, DJ Carisma from L.A. radio station Power 106 came on stage for a DJ set that lasted more than half an hour.
“I’m tryna get y’all hype as fuck before I bring my girl Saweetie out here,” Carisma said to the crowd.
“So y’all know I used to go here, right?” Saweetie asked after her first song. “I got my fucking degree, and I got to the motherfucking bag.”
After performing her breakout hit “ICY GRL” and throwing T-shirts with the phrase “Respect the icy punani” on them into the crowd, Saweetie brought out her partner, rapper Quavo of rap trio Migos, for their collab “Tip Toes.”
“Do you mind if I do a couple songs?” Quavo asked over chants of his own name.
Saweetie left the stage while Quavo — whose performance alongside Migos at Springfest 2017 was canceled  because of overcrowding — played “Pure Water” and “Bad and Boujee.”
“USC, we love y’all, you know I love y’all,” Quavo said. “I gotta give the stage back to my beautiful lady, the icy girl.”
Saweetie came back onstage to talk about her experience at USC and play her smash single, “My Type.”
“You know, I was in debt,” she said. “That motherfucking loan shit was no joke.”
Toward the end of her set, Saweetie invited three students, including Ariadna Cruz, a junior majoring in NGOs and social change, on stage to dance from the crowd. After the show, the trio took photos with Saweetie and received a silver, Icy-branded necklace. 
“I was just overexcited. She’s also from the Bay Area, so having someone who’s from the Bay on stage and someone who is an alum and is of color is so amazing and so exciting,” Cruz said. “I did not think I was going to meet her, so I think meeting her made it a thousand times better.” 
Following the dance competition, Saweetie’s set came to a quick close.
“Get your motherfucking good grades. Fuck that bitch Sallie Mae,” she said, referring to the federal loan company.
While some were disappointed by the length of her set, they felt it did not detract from their experience.
“She did her top songs, which everyone loved, everyone screamed for,” said Marlize Duncan, a freshman majoring in journalism. “I don’t mind the dirty shoes that I got from everyone moshing.”
With a Ferris wheel, an esports tournament against UCLA, student group showcases and sponsored booths with giveaways, Conquest strived to bring students more of an experience than just a concert.
Like last year, USC’s Esports Union faced off against UCLA’s esports team in a League of Legends tournament. While last year’s matchup ended in a tie, this year’s saw a 3-2 victory for USC.
Following the recent rise in student deaths, Conquest invited various organizations that provide mental health resources to the event, including the Department of Mental Health and Rise Above the Disorder. 
“We’re just out here trying to make sure that people know that it’s OK to reach out for help and to normalize talking about mental health,” said Rise Above the Disorder case manager Crystal Navarro. 
For the second consecutive year, Trojan Pride Committee replaced the annual tradition of burning a Bruin bear with an opportunity for students to throw pie tins full of whipped cream at a large print of a Bruin. While last year’s bonfire was canceled out of concerns of unhealthy air quality, this year it was out of respect for those affected by the recent Getty wildfire.
“We were caught off guard with the fires last year, but as a result, this year I came in, and I’m like, ‘We need to have an alternate plan from the start,’” said Trojan Pride member Yuliya Pisman. “We were planning backups from the very beginning, so it was less stressful when we learned that it was canceled.” 
Despite the unforeseen circumstances surrounding the event’s planning, Conquest drew an impressive 6,500 students, an increase of approximately 1,500 from last year’s event. According to Kashfi, the event “literally could not have gone better.” 
“Concerts Committee is only as strong as the members that make it up, and I think today was a fantastic example of the insane amount of talented individuals we have been lucky to acquire within our club in the last two years,” Begler said.

The USC women’s basketball team fell 74-64 Saturday night at Galen Center after a tight battle with No. 6 powerhouse Texas A&M. This marks the second loss of the season for the team and the fifth win for the Aggies.
The teams traded the lead eight times in the first half, but the competition tapered off as Texas A&M won the third quarter 19-13 and never looked back. Poor rebounding from USC led to the Aggies’ runoff, which included 9 unanswered points and strong defense from A&M junior guard Kayla Wells and senior guard Shambria Washington. 
The Aggies once led by 14 points, but the Trojans were able to fight back and come within 9 with just under three minutes left in the fourth. However, the Trojans were unable to close the gap, and the Aggies held on.
Both teams were sharp in the field throughout the game, but rebounding struggles ultimately did USC in, as Texas A&M far outpaced the Trojans 44-26. 
USC freshman guard Endyia Rogers posted her first 20-point college game, while freshman forward Alissa Pili followed with 12 points. This is the third game both Rogers and Pili have led the Trojans in points, as both players scored double digits in the loss against UC Santa Barbara last weekend.
The four-freshman roster could not match up to A&M’s veteran group. The Aggies played a junior- and senior-exclusive squad carrying deep NCAA tournament experience from last season. Junior guard Chennedy Carter, an All-American and First Team All-SEC player, scored 26 points for A&M while junior forward N’Dea Jones racked up 18 rebounds.
Head coach Mark Trakh kept his lineup nearly identical to the UC Santa Barbara game, only replacing freshman guard Alyson Miura with senior forward Kayla Overbeck. Overbeck had been sidelined due to an injury and had last played against UC Riverside two weeks ago for just two minutes.
A noticeable absence in Saturday’s lineup was graduate transfer guard Stephanie Watts, who was also unavailable last week. Watts joins freshman guard Madison Campbell and redshirt sophomore guard Shalexxus Aaron on the injured list, with Campbell and Aaron yet to see the court this season. 
The Trojans will not face another ranked team in pre-conference play. However, notable upcoming opponents include Nebraska on Friday and Alabama on Saturday at the South Point Shootout in Las Vegas.
The Aggies acted as the warm up for the competition the Trojans can expect in women’s basketball Pac-12 play. USC’s first conference game is against No. 11 UCLA. 
“I think we played very well as a team,” Rogers told The Eagle after the game. “Obviously, we have to build on it and take it to the next game and then to conference.”
USC’s ability to compete with a ranked team and keep up offensively gives the Trojans reason for optimism moving forward. 
The Trojans will take on Nebraska to open the 2019 South Point Shootout in Las Vegas Friday at 5:45 p.m.

Most college students face a dilemma when it comes to eating at school: It’s all but impossible to find an option that’s convenient, affordable and healthy. Everytable’s subscription program, through which students can order a week of balanced meals at about half the price of similar delivery services, addresses the challenge of eating well with a packed schedule.
Everytable, a Los Angeles-based food company and social enterprise, strives to increase accessibility to healthy meals in underserved communities across the city by offering convenient, wholesome food options. 
At the end of 2018, the company piloted a subscription delivery service to cater to customers with packed schedules who may live too far to make daily trips to the brick-and-mortar stores. Several of the more than 200 customers who have since purchased the meal program are USC students.
Everytable was established in 2016 and currently operates seven restaurants in the L.A. area, including one located less than a mile from campus. 
According to Everytable founder and CEO Sam Polk, the average price of an Everytable meal delivered to a USC address ranges from $5 to $6. Everytable stores located in higher-income neighborhoods like Brentwood sell the same meals at higher prices — typically $7 to $8, according to General Manager of Operations and Subscription Chad Massura. 
“We price our meals according to the average household income of the surrounding area,” said Massura, a 2017 graduate. 
The subscription service allows students to select meals to be delivered to their dorm, apartment or home. Massura said the service was created after Everytable’s management noticed that customers tended to buy several meals at a time for themselves and their families to eat throughout the week.
“What a lot of our customers are doing is they come in on Sunday or they come in on Monday to our stores, and they stock up for the week,” Massura said. “Subscription was really built as a way to just make that easier for them.”
Everytable also operates SmartFridges at various locations around the city, including the Health Sciences Campus. This initiative was launched earlier this year. The refrigerators, which are stocked daily with healthy, locally-prepared meals and accept credit card payment, were created to address the issue of L.A. food deserts, places where fast food may be easily accessible but balanced, high-quality meals are harder to come by.
Polk said Everytable owes its low pricing to its business model, which utilizes a centralized kitchen where food is prepared daily and then delivered to each restaurant as well as subscribers around L.A.
“Every single day, at a huge kitchen, we have incredible chefs make all these meals from scratch and then package them in grab-and-go containers,” Polk said. “That means when we open a restaurant, like the restaurant on 23rd St., it’s less expensive to build and operate.”
With the centralized process of food preparation, Everytable saves money by eliminating kitchens from each of its restaurants, reducing the size of each building. The company cuts costs while keeping its food high quality and convenient, Polk said. 
“What’s really amazing about this service is first of all, how good and healthy the food is,” Polk said. “A lot of the research that we’ve done around college students is that they’re looking for food that is fresh and healthy, but also, all students are on a budget, and so they need it to be affordable.”
Everytable also offers a “Pay It Forward Wall” program at all of its locations. A customer can choose to pay for an additional meal, write a message on a Post-it note and place it on the designated pay-it-forward board. Then, any customer who visits the store but is unable to pay can select a note from the wall and use it to pay for their meal.
“We don’t question why people don’t have the money or whether they don’t,” Polk said. “If you come in and you see a Post-it on that board, you can take it down and use it as cash — no questions asked.” 
Massura said Everytable is addressing food insecurity on college campuses directly and plans to open more locations near other colleges as well, including Santa Monica Community College and CSU Los Angeles.
“College food insecurity is a really big issue and one that we’ve sort of been confronting head-on,” Massura said. “We think that just by basically providing healthy food at fast food prices, we can be part of many solutions to this issue.”

A new wellness desk, will be added to Annenberg Media next semester to encourage students to report on mental health and wellness and improve the mental health of the news staff.
Next semester, Annenberg Media executive editor Ruby Yuan and managing editor for culture and outreach Dan Toomey will hire student editors for the desk who will oversee a group of reporters. 
“What we are doing is to lay out the foundation, lay out this system and logistics and everything,” Yuan said. “And hopefully, in the future generations … [and in] future classes, people will keep developing this desk and make it helpful to both [the] newsroom and USC community.” 
Toomey said the initial idea came from the Kaleigh Finnie Memorial Endowment. The endowment was started by the Finnie family to honor the life of their daughter, who was a USC student, and support students interested in exploring issues related to mental health. 
The endowment is a merit-based fund that provides scholarships and awards to Annenberg undergraduate and graduate students who contribute to the conversation around mental health. Toomey applied and received the funding. 
In the announcement posted to Annenberg Media, Toomey encouraged people to contact Annenberg  Media reporters over social media or email to talk about mental health.  Toomey said the desk is modeled after an initiative by The Denver Post, which piloted off-the-record community conversations about mental health around Colorado. The Post received a grant from Annenberg’s Center for Health Journalism to support initiatives for the project. 
“This sounds very industry-talk, but journalism at the end of the day is a service, right?” Toomey said. “I really do believe that by telling these stories, we are doing a service. We are helping people understand that it’s OK to share these stories, and we want people to do that so we understand the changes that need to happen.”
Yuan said the desk will also educate staff members about reporting on mental health and wellness topics and help improve their own mental health as they cover difficult topics. 
Yuan, a senior majoring in journalism, experienced firsthand what it means to report on difficult topics and the effects these events had. In two years, he covered both the Thousand Oaks shooting in 2018 and the Santa Clarita shooting in November. He covered a fire, a robbery, a murder trial and a story on financial aid difficulties in a four-week period last spring. 
Yuan wishes there were more school-specific or industry-specific mental health counselors, either at Engemann Student Health Center or at each school. 
As an adviser for the wellness desk, Annenberg Media Center Director and professor Christina Bellantoni said she hopes the desk can help student journalists learn to cover sensitive issues. 
“I always stress to every student I ever meet that you are a human first, and it is OK to be human and to have feelings, even while making sure you’re getting the full story and talking to all sides and all those things,” Bellantoni said. “Pretending you aren’t part of the equation is not a wise formula.”
Yuan mentioned the Daily Trojan’s wellness initiative as another way to support student newsrooms on campus. The paper also added a wellness initiative this year, directed by associate managing editor Natalie Bettendorf. 
The initiative followed coverage of major scandals last year, which was particularly taxing for Daily Trojan editors, as many skipped classes and lost sleep to cover them, Bettendorf said. 
Over the summer, Bettendorf met with Engemann professionals to figure out ways to better support editors and other staff members. The initiative now includes monthly check-ins with all the editors, giving writers and editors more days off, channels for feedback from staff members and ensuring more mental and physical health coverage in the paper.   
“It opened up this conversation that I thought that we were just having in our campus, in our newsroom,” Bettendorf said. “But to realize that it’s happening in newsrooms across the country, —specifically colleges and universities — that was just mind-boggling to me. I didn’t realize how people are having these same kinds of conversations of how we can take better care of student journalists? I think that was the most striking thing for me.”

More than 25 students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan Thursday afternoon to denounce the University’s treatment of hospitality employees in the wake of a contract negotiation that began Nov. 13. 
The students held signs that read “We stand with the workers of USC” and “Workers of the world unite.” At the demonstration, protesters spoke about workers’ holiday hours cuts and housing expenses. They alleged that the University owns many of its employees’ residences and charges them by the bed, making rent too expensive for staff with larger families.
Several of the students requested not to be identified, saying that the protest emphasized communal leadership and that allowing any individual to speak for the group would be counterproductive to the goal of the protest.
One speaker said at the protest that the University allocated funds unequally to administrators and lower wages for the workers.
“It is a distribution problem; it’s not a resource problem,” he said. “How can a school with a $5 billion endowment say that they don’t have the capital to pay their workers? A school that is constantly expanding, gentrifying the surrounding neighborhood, adding to the increasing homeless population of Los Angeles — how can they say they don’t have the capital to pay their workers?”
According to the University, USC has negotiated contracts with Local 11 in the past and expects to do so in this case as well. 
“We believe the university offers competitive compensation and exemplary benefits that make it a place people want to work,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We look forward to continued discussions with the union’s bargaining team and working together toward a new contract.”
During the protest, students walked from Tommy Trojan to the Tutor Campus Center until an operations coordinator asked that they relocate to avoid disrupting nearby students and blocking the TCC entrance. The protesters then walked across McCarthy Quad before stopping at USC Village, where they continued to chant and made speeches using a megaphone before returning to the center of campus.
As they marched, students chanted, “Racist, classist, neofascist” and “Hey hey, ho ho, subcontract has got to go,” referring to the University’s custodial services subcontract with Aramark, which one of the student speakers alleged works in the private prison industry. According to Aramark’s website, the company does not operate correctional facilities or penitentiaries but provides meals to inmates in 500 correctional facilities around the United States.
An estimated 800 housing and hospitality workers at USC have partnered with Unite Here Local 11, a union for workers in Southern California and Arizona, to negotiate contracts with the University. The negotiations began last week, when Unite Here Local 11 negotiator Austin Lynch presented workers’ demands for increased wages and consistent working hours to University administration.
Ariann Barker, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, spoke at the protest and said she believes that under current conditions, workers’ rights are being infringed upon by insufficient pay and housing challenges.
“The workers that work in [USC] Village, the workers that work to scan your food in the dining hall, the workers that work in the [Customer Service Centers], who clean your room — everyone in this space has not been given the rights that they are guaranteed,” Barker said.
Alejandro Rico-Gomez, a freshman majoring in fine arts who attended the protest, said students’ own backgrounds make the workers’ rights issue hit close to home. He said it was important for all members of the working class to unite on behalf of those struggling, saying that staff, students and faculty should come together to fight against what he called an oppressive administration.
“We are here not only because of the awful conditions of the workers at USC, but because the struggle for breaking down those conditions is entwined with a greater struggle for the political power of the working class,” Rico-Gomez said. “We hope that the contract that the workers are fighting for is passed.”
Rico-Gomez said he learned about the protest on social media. The protest organizers spread the word using an Instagram account called Active Change USC that became active in the week preceding the protest and posted about the workers’ rights issues discussed at the protest. Students also placed flyers about the protest in residence halls and around campus.
