This year, 70 members of USC’s class of 2013 opted to teach for two years in low-income school districts across the country through Teach for America.  USC is now the second largest contributor to the program in the country, according to rankings released last week.
“USC has a perfect storm for Teach for America corps members,” USC Recruitment Manager Carrington Bester said. “It’s already one of America’s top institutions, and then you add that they are being educated in South Central Los Angeles, one of the poorest communities in the state. You have this interesting dichotomy of wealth and privilege and academia and surrounded by kids who are just blocks away who will never be able to enroll in ’SC for no other reason than their zip code and tax bracket.”
Throughout Teach For America’s 23-year history, more than 465 USC alumni have taught as corps members, and about 5 percent of USC’s 2013 graduating class applied to the program. USC has ranked as a top contributing university for the past six years.
“Students are interested in playing a role in the movement to reform,” Shawnee Cohn, manager of regional communications for Teach for America, said. “Over 60 million children grow up in poverty, a majority not getting the education they deserve. Where the child is born changes their educational destiny. I think the ranking is a testament to the fact that [USC] students are really looking to have an immediate impact on future generations.”
More than 57,000 people in total applied to Teach For America this past year, and 5,200 were accepted to work as corps members for at least two years. Corps members are full-time employees at high-needs schools.
“There is no ideal applicant except for one that believes they can make an impact and really enjoy leadership and a challenge,” Bester said. “We recognize that the problem is so complex that we literally only want the best and brightest and nothing less. We seek to engage young people who are going to make a transformative impact around the world and are really making sure they’re making that impact in the classroom and the life of kids.”
The application process involves a written statement, several rounds of interviews and the creation of sample lesson plans. They receive one-on-one coaching through an instructional adviser. Two-thirds of Teach For America alumni work in the educational field at the conclusion of their two-year contract.
Teach For America accepts students from across all majors. Rikiesha Pierce, an alumna who majored in sociology at USC and began her first year with Teach for America this fall, said her major relates to her work as a teacher, even though she teaches other subjects.
“Sociology is not directly related to teaching but it does help me understand my surroundings,” Pierce said. “Having the sociological environment helps me understand the people that I interact with. I am able to view my community from a sociological lens, which gives me an advantage.”
Pierce is teaching third and fourth grade self-contained special education students. She said she never considered teaching as a career, though she volunteered at schools in Downtown Los Angeles before considering joining Teach for America. The pull of the highly competitive program, Pierce said, is that it gives corps members the opportunity to get paid to positively impact underserved communities.
“She painted a picture of the opportunity to give back in one of the most real ways, being on the front lines of the education,” Pierce said.
Founded in 1990, Teach for America’s goal is to end education inequity. Today, more than 11,000 corps members teach in rural and urban areas throughout the country.
Erik White, a business entrepreneurship and Spanish double major who graduated in 2013, said he identifies with the children he now teaches.
“I grew up in a single-parent household in a low-income community,” White said. “I always thought that education was a place to do well, no matter what my situation might be like — it’s a great equalizer. Even though these kids might have the same potential that someone saw in me, no one is there to see that. The kids will have at least one more advocate, one more person who knows what they can achieve and knows that they can do that.”
White teaches at Camino Nuevo High School, a new charter school minutes from the USC campus.
“The first day of teaching is very intense,” he said. “It’s a lot of learning on the go. I’m trying things for the first time. It might go well, it might go badly.”
Because this is the school’s first year, there is no established curriculum or lesson plans. Therefore, White has more personal control over the education of his students.
White says he plans to stay on as a teacher at Camino Nuevo for at least four years.
“I want to see my freshmen this year go to college,” he said. “Even if I don’t do education forever, given my socio-economic background, I understand.”
Pierce said that she sees a common thread throughout the students that entered the corps.
“The people that I know from USC who went on with Teach For America were the most active people on campus in terms of service and leadership in the community,” Pierce said. “These are the people that want to innovate and invigorate in societies and communities.”

“Cool.” “Chill.” “Easy to talk to.” These were all words various student workers at Webb and Fluor Towers used to describe charismatic maintenance worker Oziel “Ozzy” Albarran. Despite being much older than most of the students he meets, Albarran is beloved by residents for his easygoing demeanor and genuine desire to connect.

“He feels just like another student. It’s just easy to talk to him,” said Gina Ibrahim, a junior double majoring in psychology and cognitive science.
Albarran, 30, frequently chats with student workers at Fluor and Webb Towers when he is not busy with work. From helping students get haircuts to giving out life advice, many students have a story to tell about Albarran and how he has helped them through rough patches, or simply made their day a little more entertaining.
Albarran has been especially influential to junior Rubi Garcia, an American studies major. Albarran helped Garcia realize how fortunate she was to be studying abroad, even though she will be going to Chile instead of her first choice, Brazil. This happened one day by accident when Garcia was on her way to work at the check-in desk at Webb Tower, and Albarran ran into her and realized something was on her mind.
“Even though what he said was common sense, at the moment I guess just hearing how right he was, that basically just made my whole day,” Garcia said. “He really does know the students, like he automatically picked up that something was wrong with me.”
Adrian Johnson, a sophomore majoring in business administration who also works at Fluor and Webb Towers, said Albarran once gave him dating advice. On another occasion, Albarran even helped Johnson with his hair.
“My hair was real bad; it was real nappy. He took me down to his barber shop on Central Avenue, and his barber hooked me up. It was a good time,” Johnson said.
Albarran, has been a custodian at Fluor and Webb Towers for the entire seven years he has worked at USC, starting when he was 23 years old. Albarran said he chose to work at USC because they offer employees tuition benefits, but he truly enjoys the college atmosphere and being surrounded by so many young people all the time.
Albarran once helped junior Raul Alcantar, a cinema and television production major who is a student supervisor at Fluor and Webb Towers, complete an assignment on how immigrants assimilate into America. Albarran was born in Mexico and came to the United States when he was eight months old.
“So I did an interview on him, how he came to the U.S. He actually sat down and opened up about his whole experience,” Alcantar said.
Family has also been an important aspect of Albarran’s life. He is currently raising two sons who both attend school in Los Angeles. Albarran is working hard to make sure they will have the financial means to go wherever they want for college.
“If I graduated from here it would be awesome if my two kids graduated from here, just to keep it going,” Albarran said.
Albarran has been going to college for a year and a half. Currently, he attends night classes at Santa Monica College. Though he chose to major in accounting because it has a relatively high level of job security, Albarran said he originally considered industrial design.
In the future, Albarran plans to transfer to USC, where he aims to focus specifically on his core accounting courses. He hopes to be done with school by the time he is 35.
“My oldest son would be about 12, and my little guy would be 10. They’ll be old enough where, even if I have to work like a billion hours, they won’t really miss me,” Albarran said.
Seeing student life at USC when he first started working is what Albarran said actually inspired him to go back to school. Through his job, he was able to witness the fun side of college and realized that it was not all studying. Speaking with students also altered Albarran’s perception that college is only for “super geniuses.” He realized that if the people he met here could earn college degrees, then so could he.
Albarran said he feels grateful to his family members for being his support network and allowing him to easily juggle work, family and school. Though he has a lot on his plate, Albarran said he does not usually feel overwhelmed because he always tries to look at the bigger picture.
“Life is pretty easy,” Albarran said. “We just choose to make it difficult.”

Smart watches are probably not the next big thing in technology, according to the Center for the Digital Future, a research institute under USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, whose researchers have been following the same group of people for 13 years.  According to the study, only 3 percent of those surveyed use smart watches.
Back to the Future · The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is a hotspot for student and professors conducting research. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
According to Phys.org, the annual study, which “has given the think tank long-range insights into changing consumer behavior,” has also shown that smart watches may not have the same appeal as smartphones hold for the younger demographic.
The sale of smart watches is expected to grow from 1 million to 36 million in the next five years, according to a Juniper Research report. The report described the devices as “a smart wearable appcessory that can be worn on a user’s wrist, offering a range of smart functionalities in conjunction with an external platform, such as the smartphone or tablet.” Companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Google have plans to enter this growing market.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the results of the smart watch study align with other market research surveys. Statistics show that consumers are largely uninterested in gadgets such as Nike’s Fuel Band, Google Glass and smart watches.
The study made note of millennials’ aversion to smart watches in particular.
“A lot of the millennial behavior is transitory … But as people age, they still are not wearing watches, and we’ll begin to find out next month if that behavioral change is transformational,” Jeffrey Cole, director of the Center for the Digital Future, told Los Angeles Times.
Many students said they would rather have a smartphone than a smart watch, supporting the study’s findings.
“I don’t think I would want that around my wrist. You use [a watch] for time, but most people use it as an accessory function. It’s for fashion,” Yu Jin, a junior majoring in communications and international relations, said.
Some students, however, think a watch might be more practical than a phone.
“I would wear a smart watch. It’s a lot more convenient than carrying a phone around,” Omar Nasir, a junior majoring in business administration, said. “People wear watches anyway, and to have a watch that you can use as a phone is even better.”
As the Annenberg study shows people have differing opinions on whether or not the smart watch has the potential to surpass the smartphone. One of students’ main concerns was how much a smart watch would be accessible in classrooms.
“The screen is too small which gives it limited use. It’s not accurate. It could also get damaged when doing stuff. If you go to school, they’ll make you take it off,” Minh La, a senior studying computer science, said.
Others believe schools might give a little more leeway to the watches.
“It does seem very practical. However, it makes me wonder how to use our phones in class, but what can they do to students when we are wearing a watch? I can’t imagine them banning a watch,” said Ayisha Emerson, an undecided sophomore.

It must be far too early to see the impact of so-called smart watches on both the mobile phone market and the ‘traditional’ watch market. Annenberg are right that the ‘next big thing’ often fails to match the hype. Time will tell.

Ranked No. 23, USC and crosstown rival UCLA tied on the 2014 U.S. News and World Report National University Rankings released Monday night, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Both schools increased one spot higher from last year, sharing the ranking with Carnegie Mellon, the University of Virginia and Wake Forest University. Last year, both Los Angeles schools shared the No. 24 ranking with the University of Virginia.
Rankings are determined using multiple criteria, including acceptance rates, graduation rates, faculty and freshmen retention. However, U.S. News and World Report said their methodology for determining this year’s rankings has changed, putting less emphasis on freshmen academics and adding more emphasis to factors such as graduation rate performance and incoming freshmen SAT and ACT exam scores.
Overall, the magazine said these changes have had a minimal effect on the top 50 rankings.

Former Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy visited the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy, and Ethics at the USC Gould School of Law on Monday to join with USC Gould Professor Elyn Saks, USC law student Evan Langinger and USC psychiatry resident Michelle Wu to engage in a discussion panel on mental illness. The audience included many prominent members of local mental illness reform advocacy groups.
Speaking out · Former Congressman Patrick Kennedy discusses his history with bipolar disorder during a panel at USC Gould School of Law. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
A former Rhode Island representive, Kennedy opened the event by describing his past with mental illness. Kennedy, who was accused of driving under the influence of prescription drugs in 2006, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and an addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs while at a drug rehabilitation facility.
Kennedy came to the event as a mental health advocate. He told of his efforts in Congress that resulted in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, a 2008 bill that requires most health insurance companies to afford mental illnesses with the same amount of coverage with which they treat physical illnesses.
Kennedy originally became involved with the Saks Institute for personal reasons.
“Elyn is a personal friend and someone I admire greatly. In the community of mental health she is one of our brightest stars because she has taken on the most difficult issue related to mental illness and that is the destigmatization of [mental illness],” Kennedy said.
Kennedy said he came to USC with the intention of bringing awareness to the community about mental illnesses and helping begin the discussion about acceptance for those who are mentally ill. Many students who attended the panel were eager to hear about possible changes to mental illness legislation.
“I’m all for the elimination of the mental health taboo. I believe that ignoring those with mental health issues has put a burden on families and societies who try to help those with ailments without proper medical resources,” Chasen Washington, an undecided freshman, said. “People deserve to have their problems addressed.”
At the panel, Kennedy, Langinger and Wu gave personal testimonies of their own struggles dealing with various mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder and depression. Kennedy also spoke about how the Mental Health Parity and Addition Equity Act was the first step in healthcare reform that America needed.
“That’s our healthcare [system] today, it’s sick care not health care,” he said.
According to Kennedy, society as a whole needs to address the broader attitudinal barriers toward mental illnesses.
“[Society] treats [them] as moral issues not medical issues, character issues not chemical issues … we need to begin to end the discrimination,” he said.
Langinger, a third-year law student at USC, told his story of dealing with bipolar disorder while attending University of California, Berkeley. He spoke of the various phases of bipolar disorder, and how he eventually developed psychosis. Laginger said that the community around him essentially saw him as “another Berkeley hippie” and that it wasn’t until he flew back home for no apparent reason that his mental illness came to light.
Michelle Wu, a psychiatry resident at USC, also shared her story of dealing with depression while she was a student at Northwestern University. Wu spoke of how she went days without showering.
“I went from the star of the school to barely scraping by,” Wu said. “I [would wake up] and be disappointed that I didn’t die during the night.”
She was eventually diagnosed with depression after going to a psychiatrist, and is now healthy.
Many students spoke about having people close to them who were affected by mental illnesses.
“The number of people I know who are affected by depression is definitely higher than it should be and watching them go through it is a painful process. Reform would be greatly appreciated,” Lucia Lin, a freshman majoring in East Asian languages and cultures, said.
The testimonies of Wu and Langinger encouraged many students in the audience to share their own personal stories about battling various mental illnesses at the panel.
Kennedy’s speech was well received by attendees, many of whom indicated their approval on the topic with several loud, lengthy applause breaks. Some audience members voiced their thanks to Kennedy for being an advocate of mental illnesses.
“Most people disregard mental illness as an actual disease and treat the inflicted people as anomalies instead of patients to be treated,” Jessie Guo, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said. “The healthcare for mental illnesses is often quite shoddy and needs to be improved. I’m glad Patrick Kennedy, a politician, addressed the issue.”

Abel Tesfaye, better known as The Weeknd, is not the typical R&B artist. His music explores the dark side of fame, excessive drug use and themes of sex and its destructive nature. The 23-year-old singer lived in the Toronto, Ontario area for the first 21 years of his life. He released three critically acclaimed mixtapes in 2011 (House of Balloons, Thursday, Echoes of Silence) and, after being featured on Drake’s extremely popular “October’s Very Own” blog, he signed a record deal with Universal Republic and created his own imprint label, XO. The Weeknd has finally prepared his major label debut album entitled Kiss Land.
In an interview with Complex Magazine, he said that when he thinks about Kiss Land, he thinks about a terrifying place, one with which he is very unfamiliar. As it pertains to The Weeknd’s life, it makes sense. For a young man who has lived nearly his entire life in the confines of his hometown establishing a comfort zone, suddenly being thrust into the international spotlight and touring all over the world can bring about some interesting experiences, to say the least — and Kiss Land delves deeper into those moments and relationships.
Kiss Land begins with a song called “Professional,” a spacey track with echoing background vocals detailing why love has lost meaning to him because the women he meets while on tour are only using sex and fake love as part of their profession of prostitution. These women treat this way of making money as an actual profession. Even though this particular woman has “made enough to quit a couple years ago,” her line of work consumes and traps her, forcing him to ask her, “What’s a somebody in a nobody town?”
The Weeknd, contrarily, sees through this and suggests the way out as being with him. This might also be part of his own lying game, however, because the women never stay with him, and his “ideal” relationship never comes to fruition. Kiss Land successfully explores the conflict that arises when fame and money create an abundance of insincere feelings from those outside of one’s closest circle, particularly women. The Weeknd seems to have come to terms with the fact that finding actual love with any of the women he meets now might never happen. In a strange turn, however, his realization becomes an even stronger obsession. He doesn’t care for love anymore, but the idea of falling in love is a fantasy that he likes to recreate time and time again with the women he meets on the road.
This creates an interesting dynamic on the song “Belong To The World,” where he relates so much to a woman who is immune to love that he actually begins to fall in love with her during their one-night stand. Singing to the synths, drums and frightening strings, The Weeknd relates so much to her emotionless actions that it also assures him that they could never be together. This woman’s desire to continuously move to new love experiences is further detailed in the most up-tempo song on the album, “Wanderlust.” The Weeknd’s singing style often evokes favorable comparisons with Michael Jackson because of an extremely similar vibrato in his voice, as well as his ability to hit powerful falsetto notes. This song gives the best example of this resemblance, in part because of the dance-style beat and his nearly identical “Whoo!” adlibs throughout this song.
The only feature on the album is with fellow Toronto-native Drake, who adds yet another great verse to his repertoire in the crew anthem, “Live For.” The Weeknd’s role is limited on the song, singing a short intro verse and a catchy hook of, “This the sh-t that I live for / with the people I’d die for.” Drake stands out on this track with perfectly timed flow on the beat, dropping rhymes referencing everything from Demi Moore to Prince.
The Weeknd isn’t an artist that many fans will feel an intimate connection with. For some who hear his music, they might not be able to relate to the subject matter he sings about at all. The dark focus of his music is not exactly inviting to an audience, and it can be downright depressing at times.
But he doesn’t necessarily want listeners to feel his pain. The Weeknd acknowledges this directly on the title track, “Kiss Land,” a song about his interactions with female fans after his shows. He repeatedly sings the phrase, “This ain’t nothin’ to relate to” during the last minutes of the song. But though he gets listeners to feel the way he feels, it would be interesting in the next album if The Weeknd could entice listeners to understand the way he feels.

In just a couple of days, Keiji Inafune, the creator of the original Mega Man series, was able to raise a cool $1.2 million on Kickstarter.
Even though his project, which he calls Mighty No. 9, won’t be available until 2015, enough people believe in Inafune’s vision that he’s already raised $300,000 more than his original goal — and he still has a month left in the campaign.
The days of going door-to-door to ask for donations are over. If you have an idea, garnering support from generous strangers has never been as easy as it is now.
Crowdfunding, the act of pooling money from a group of people to fund an idea, can be dated back to Gulliver’s Travels author Jonathan Swift, who began a fund to help low-income families in Ireland. But this way of crowdfunding has changed immensely since then. In 2000, artistShare debuted as the first documented crowdfunding site for music. Five years later, Kiva came along as a microlending site for entrepreneurs in impoverished areas, with Indiegogo and Kickstarter following in 2008 and 2009, respectively.
Anyone can crowdfund — from average folks to the likes of Zach Braff and Spike Lee. Seeing a great project come to life is exciting for both the creator and his or her backers. Because many crowdfunding sites put the responsibility of investigating the validity of the creators and their projects on the backers, however, if you find out that you’ve been scammed, it’s your problem.
The story behind the dystopian, pro-urban destruction boardgame, The Doom That Came To Atlantic City by The Forking Path, is a strange one. After raising nearly quadruple the original goal amount, the game was suddenly canceled a month later. Erik Chevelier, founder of The Forking Path, said in an update to backers that “every possible mistake was made, some due to my inexperience in board game publishing, others due to ego conflicts, legal issues and technical complications.” In other words, no one but Chevlier and his team know where the money for the project is now.
One campaign that hit on a personal level was the Kobe Beef Jerky project. As someone with a love for jerky and high-quality meats, I couldn’t resist — a small donation would get backers a sample-size pouch of this jerky as a gift. This project seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately it was.
Minutes before the campaign was scheduled to end, the makers of a Kickstarter documentary helped to pull the plug on the phony project after finding out that this jerky didn’t even exist. If it wasn’t for some sleuthing, $120,000 in backer money would have gone into the pockets of these scammers.
I was devastated, but I should have known better. Kobe beef usually goes for about $100 for 4 ounces, and it did seem strange that a paltry $7 donation would get me a hearty sample pack of this premium jerky. Not to mention, a Google search of supposedly Los Angeles-based Magnus Fun — the company behind the Kobe Beef Jerky — didn’t bring up anything — no website, profiles, photos or videos. Magnus Fun was as fake as its jerky.
Not all crowdfunding campaigns are bogus, though. Despite the fact that 84 percent of Kickstarters do not ship on time, many of these projects do eventually deliver.
With the help of nearly 70,000 backers, Pebble Technology, the company behind the now popular Pebble E-Paper Watch, raised more than $10 million for its project. A combination of lots of press attention, publicity on Kickstarter and sheer curiosity helped to make this one of the most successful projects in crowdfunding history. And even though there were some delays in the shipment at first, Pebble now even sells these watches at Best Buy for $150 each.
There are projects started by USC students that have been quite successful.
AIO Robotics, a startup founded by USC doctoral candidate Jens Windau, raised more than $100,000 in one day for its all-in-one 3-D copy device, Zeus.
Another USC Kickstarter project created to help raise funds for a student-produced web series, 101 Ways To Get Rejected, was able to surpass three of its stretch goals for the campaign.
Benjamin Chance, one of the producers, noted that most of the backers were in some way related to those involved in the project, but there were also plenty of fans that donated as well.
“In our case, crowdfunding brought life to our project. We were overwhelmed by the results of our campaign,” Chance said.
But crowdfunding is still far from perfect.
Before submitting their project to Kickstarter, project creators are told that if they do not send backer gifts after being successfully funded, this inability to carry out promises might result in damage to their reputations as well as the possibility of backers taking legal actions.
Grave consequences may follow for project creators who can’t deliver. But a lot of times, nothing happens if something goes wrong, since the penalties are not serious enough. If it wasn’t for the Kickstarter documentary team, I would have been scammed out of $7. Would I sue for $7? No. And would Magnus Fun, the fake jerky company, suffer any damage to its reputation? None at all since, as a made-up company, it had no reputation in the first place.
It’s understandable that Kickstarter, along with other crowdfunding platforms, do not want to be held accountable for these projects. But more needs to be done. For one, Kickstarter staff can help research the validity of the projects and see if the project checks out, along with its creator. If more scams surface, Kickstarter should conduct background checks on each project creator as well as ask for official blueprints or, if a project is advanced enough, copies of patents.
Even if more guidelines aren’t implemented, crowdfunding still ranks as one of the best ways to raise money if you’re not looking into seed funding.
It’s amazing to see how one idea can bring so many people together. Think back to Pebble and its massive following. Even though we probably care more about the product than the team behind it, we’re still banking on an incredible idea to come true. We’re funding bite-sized American Dreams, in a sense. Though it’s recommended to be wary when funding projects, don’t be shy. And if you’re looking to get funded, make sure you can prove the legitimacy of your project and plan out all of the logistics so the crowd that’s backing you doesn’t turn into a mob.

Ashoka is also combining crowd funding with on the ground vetting with checks and balances, in terms of opening up their Fellowships to be crowdfunded.  Generally I think marketing is winning over quality right now in the crowdfunding space.
While the sites you mention are the biggies, there’s a subset of crowdfunding sites that generally do vet their projects thoroughly and while not quite as flavor-of-the-moment, could end up being just as important as business crowdfunding sites: civic crowdfunding sites. For sites like Neighbor.ly and Citizivestor, the idea is a civic platform for community-backed projects. Want to build a local dog park? Get your neighbors–or strangers–to donate. How about saving an old historic building–mobilize your community & preservationists nationally. Good businesses will find a way to get funds, but rarely have projects for the good of everyone been so voluntarily financed.

Perhaps it wasn’t in the stars for a quasi-Buffy the Vampire Slayer reunion to happen.
Sister act · Dagney Kerr (left) plays Maxine, the picture-perfect sister of Molly (Cameryon Meyer, right) in The Bells of West 87th Street. – Courtesy of Marla Halac
Juliet Landau and James Marsters, who played the infamous vampire pair Drusilla and Spike in Joss Whedon’s acclaimed series were set to reunite as a different kind of romantic duo for the world premiere of The Bells of West 87th at the Greenway Court Theater on Fairfax Avenue on Saturday. Unfortunately, only a few days ago, Landau was forced to step aside from the role of the lead character, Molly Fein, because of scheduling conflicts, and Cameron Meyer (Three Sisters at the Odyssey and Cold/Tender) stepped in to the role.
Though it would have been thrilling to see Landau and Marsters reunite, Meyer in the lead role gave Bells the opportunity to show that the script could stand firmly on its own two legs — even without Landau and Marsters’ chemistry. In fact, the show, written by Elin Hampton (Dream On, Mad About You, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), manages to reach an almost pitch perfect comedic pace at times, as it chronicles the life of Molly, a 40-year-old building manager and amateur poet who is trying to finally break away from her neurotic, dysfunctional family.
Hampton’s Woody Allen-esque comedy is set on the Upper West Side of New York, in two adjacent apartments. Molly lives in one, her father, the other. But Molly doesn’t live alone — her overbearing mother, Ida (played brilliantly by Carol Locatell, who captures the essence of the little old Jewish lady), has been secretly living with Molly rather than with Molly’s perfect sister, Maxine (another Buffy alum, Dagney Kerr, who makes an impact, despite less stage time) on Staten Island where she is supposed to be. (Bells loves to use real estate to establish personalities.)
Though Ida has been separated from her father, Eli (played by the hilarious, bathrobe-wearing Robert Towers), for years, she finds herself most comfortable with the overly amenable (read: doormat) daughter Molly and also, though she might deny it, she finds comfort in keeping track of her husband’s movements.
One might wonder how Eli has not discovered she is living next door, but Ida has a system for that: Eli is hard of hearing and she has hung bells all over the windows and doors of his apartment to hear when he is coming and going.
Molly has a secret of her own that she has been keeping from her family: She has been seeing someone on the sly, a man she met at a night poetry class named Chris Germain (played by Marsters, who falls into the character of the loveable, clueless poet with an effortlessness that is enviable). Tonight is the night that Molly is finally going to introduce him to her family when he comes over for dinner.
All of the pieces have been set in place for an explosive evening and half the fun is watching it unfold. The jokes never stop coming and the constant chime of the bells add to the campy element of the play.
When the situations just become too much for Molly, the play suddenly freezes and Molly steps to the front, a blue light on her, and lets loose her angsty poetry, spitting out verbs and adjectives with comical vitriol. Meyer is best in these asides. As she was the last to join the cast, it is to be expected that there are moments where her character does not feel as established as the others. She still manages to hold her own amongst the other actors though, and in these moments, especially, the character feels more hers.
It is easy to imagine that much of the laughter from the audience comes because they can easily identify with these dysfunctional characters. Who hasn’t had an overbearing parent, a perfect sister or a clueless boyfriend? Sometimes these characters don’t even feel like ideas but like real people who very easily could be sitting across the street, munching on a corned beef sandwich at Canters.
There are times where the jokes might go a little too far (for example when Molly talks about moving out and living her own life, her mother says: “Anne Frank never left her attic”). But the play’s ability to not hold back is also what makes it so relatable, so personal. There is always at least one family member who isn’t politically incorrect, who might actually say that.
The play’s tagline is: “Normal is what people call families that aren’t theirs,” and that is essentially what Bells is trying to show. Every family is weird; some, like Molly’s, are more so than others. But what’s the use in striving for normal? Rather, one must accept their family for what they are and then live their own life. Between the jokes and the drama, Bells somehow manages to make this theme hit home. For Buffy fans out there: the performance was “five by five.”
The Bells of West 87th Street runs weekends through Oct. 13 at the Greenway Court Theatre.

Sometimes flirting comes naturally and strategy is not involved — but for those times it doesn’t, that’s when it would be nice to have a flirt doctor to step in and help. Because, let’s be honest, don’t we all need help to brush up on our game, at least every once in a while?
The good news is the doctor is in. The flirt doctor, that is. USC Annenberg Alumnus Dr. Jeffrey Hall, the “Flirt Doctor,” will discuss his ideas on relationships more at length when he kicks off his book tour for The Five Flirting Styles at USC Tuesday at 8 p.m. in TCC 205.
During his time at USC as he pursued his Ph.D. in communication, Hall became interested in romance and flirting and ended up writing multiple articles on this subject.
While he was immersing himself in the world of romance, he met his current wife, another USC graduate student.
Hall said what makes flirting so interesting to him is that it’s ubiquitous and performed by virtually everyone, with various degrees of complexity.
“Who isn’t interested [in flirting]? We do it constantly, [and] it’s so tricky and difficult to see,” Hall said.
When writing a short piece on the effectiveness of pickup lines during graduate school, Hall got a lucky break and began doing research for eHarmony, the online dating website. Hall collaborated with eHarmony to write an article entitled, “Individual Differences in the Communication of Romantic Interest.”
For the article, Hall and his colleagues used statistics derived from approximately 5,000 eHarmony users and sifted through all the different ways people approach flirting: their tactics, goals and strategies.
Hall’s book, The Five Flirting Styles, was a result of this research and accounts for different types of flirting and addresses how one can amp up his or her technique. The five styles he identifies are: physical, polite, playful, sincere and traditional. This book derives knowledge from the previously mentioned published article and an additional 5,000 people from around the world. He said that the main sources of information were the interviews he conducted. These people shared their stories with Hall, which makes this book scholarly yet fun and a thought-provoking read.
Hall said that the other books on the market try to sell an idea: a super method or trick. He believes there is more to flirting than a simple trick.
“My main motivator [for] writing this book was looking at the other books about flirting,” Hall said.
Hall also said that most of the other books he encountered were written primarily by journalists. He felt that by using his Ph.D. in communication he was able to approach the book in a fresh way. Still, he’s quick to assert that flirting is by no means a science.
“We can’t boil it down to that,” Hall said.
Still, science does plays a part in flirting, but factors such as personal experience and history must also be considered.
Sophomore kinesiology major Jojo Korsh said that she felt flirting styles shouldn’t be broken down into separate sections and that most students were likely to use a combination of the different styles instead of one predominant single style.
“[Hall’s] system certainly has flaws. I think you can be physical and playful but still polite … You can be sincere in your compliment without it being formal; the things I say are always genuine, but are not necessarily said with the intention of attracting a serious boyfriend,” Korsh said.
Sophomore cinema and television production major William Yelton took Hall’s online flirting styles quiz and said he found Halls’ methods generally reliable but not precise.
“Even though they weren’t totally on point, I thought my scores were pretty accurate, and I [would] definitely go to the event,” Yelton said.
Students curious about their flirting type can attend the talk Tuesday — after the discussion, Hall will field questions from the audience. And who knows? This event might just help you score that date you’ve been keeping your eye on.

The No. 1-ranked USC women’s golf team began their fall season Monday, tying for eighth after one round at the Dale McNamara Fall Preview in Tulsa, Okla. The round marked the Women of Troy’s first steps toward defending their 2012 National Championship, won by one of the largest margins in NCAA history.
Sophomore Kyung Kim, who tied for sixth at last year’s NCAA championship as a freshman, led the Women of Troy on Monday with a 1-under 69. Her score was good enough to put her in a nine-way tie for third place. Kim struggled on the front nine, but strung together two consecutive birdies on the back nine to lift her up the leaderboard and within two strokes of first place.
Freshman Gabriella Then made a strong debut for the Trojans, hovering near par all day before falling to 1-over on the 18th hole. Then is tied for 21st but is just four strokes behind Oklahoma State’s Julie Yang at the top of the leaderboard. Stanford’s Lauren Kim is in sole possession of second place.
Two of USC’s team leaders from a year ago, senior Sophia Popov and sophomore Annie Park, struggled in comparison to their excellent spring campaigns. Popov finished with a 2-over 73, while Park came in at 5-over. The odds are favorable that this pair will return to form, considering Popov is aiming at several USC career records this season and Park is defending an individual national title.
The Women of Troy have 10 strokes to make up if they are to catch leader No. 16 Oklahoma State over the next two rounds. No. 3 Duke, No. 4 Oklahoma and No. 12 Stanford also stand in the team’s way. The rest of the tournament can be followed all day Tuesday and Wednesday on golfstat.com.

It couldn’t be ignored.
Most of the time, when the home team suffers an upset loss, they say you can hear a pin drop in the stands because the crowd is in such stunned silence.
Poor taste · Flyers advocating for USC head coach Lane Kiffin’s dismissal paint an unflattering picture of fans’ and students’ loyalty. – Nick Selbe | Daily Trojan
When the clock struck zero on Saturday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, however, this was not the case. If a pin did in fact drop, no one heard it. No one could hear much of anything, really, except for the deafening chant:
“Fire Kiffin! Fire Kiffin!”
It rang throughout the entire stadium as Lane Kiffin’s Trojans stunningly, embarrassingly and, for the most part, lifelessly fell at the hands of Washington State. People outside the stadium could hear it. Those watching on television or listening on the radio could hear it. USC players heard it.
And Kiffin himself definitely heard it.
After the loss, Kiffin joked that the chants and the boos were beneficial in that they helped his team get used to playing on the road. Could you blame him if the sound of 70,000 people passionately voicing their disapproval of his job performance didn’t quite feel like home?
Or how about the fact that the morning after the loss, the USC campus was plastered with fliers that read “No Parking: Fire Lane”? And that those fliers even made their way onto Tommy Trojan, the most sacred of all USC landmarks?
Would that feel like home to you?
Kiffin and his team, particularly his offense, which performed woefully against a less-than-stellar Cougars defense, have a lot to answer for and even more to improve upon. I find it extremely unlikely that USC can win a game, much less keep a game close for that matter, if the offense fails as miserably as it did on Saturday night again this season.
Kiffin’s playcalling was questionable, and who knows if his reluctance to pick a starting quarterback and stick with him factored into the offense’s ineptitude.
But that’s a discussion for another time.
What’s so disheartening about the chants and the fliers is that, to some degree at least, USC students are responsible for them. I am not saying that students started the chants or posted the fliers, because I do not know that to be true. But some students, at least, participated in the chants. And it would take much more of a commitment to print out hundreds of copies of fliers at home and drive to USC than it would to stroll out of your dorm room and make copies at Doheny.
Nevertheless, however many students were behind the #FireKiffin movement, it’s too many.
As Trojans, we’re easy targets. Either we go to the University of Spoiled Children, have a condom brand as our mascot or we have the most corrupt athletic program in the history of college sports. When it comes to insults, we’ve heard ‘em all.
But through all the taunts, we keep our heads up. We explain that, no, we’re not holding up two fingers because we’re second best, or because we’re part of a Vietnam War protest. We do it as a “V” for victory. Because, when adversity hits, we Fight On.
Or at least we’re supposed to.
With all the vitriol being launched Kiffin’s way, though, I’m starting to wonder if “Fight On” is actually our credo or just something we say or put on a T-shirt. For better or worse, Lane Kiffin is our head coach. He is a Trojan. Even if he were the worst playcaller in the history of college football, nobody deserves that kind of treatment, and certainly not from his own team’s fans.
I like to think of myself as a positive person, but even I had nothing good to say after Saturday’s game. That’s how bad the Trojans were, and that is a reflection of the head coach. Losing to Washington State at home is unacceptable, and I understand the students’ and fans’ frustrations. Those who believe he should be fired are absolutely entitled to think that way.
But no one deserves to be called out, literally, the way Kiffin has been these past few days. And I realize that I’ve said some pretty sappy things in this column (“When adversity hits, we Fight On”? Come on), but seeing “Fire Lane” fliers defacing Tommy Trojan and hearing the Coliseum crowd turn on its team’s leader just really gets under my skin.
Saturday’s game was my first time as a student not watching a home game from the student section. As the team took the field for the first time, I watched from the press box and wished I could transport myself to Section 25 and be a part of the rowdy group.
As the game ended, though, and the chants began, for once I was thankful to be clear on the other side of the stadium.

I’m sorry, but those who disdain booing can only be part of the “everyone gets a trophy”  crowd.  Not everyone wins – ask the team – and coaches are hired – and fired – for winning, plain and simple
Couldn’t agree less. Kiffin hasn’t been doing his job, and needs to get sacked. 
This situation would be very different if we didn’t have the talent. The season thus far could then be explained as the unfortunate result of a small pool to pick from. That’s not the reality of it, though.  We’ve got Marqise Lee, Silas Redd, Su’a Cravens, Nelson Agholor, etc. Kessler was ranked as the second best pro-style quarterback recruit in his class by Rivals.com, and many of the other players boast similar national rankings. Come on. 
Fact of the matter is, Kiffin isn’t doing the job he’s getting paid a lot of money to do ($2,400,000 annually). Sure – losses are expected to some degree – but to Washington State? Please. 
Fire Kiffin, Fight On.
Agree with you. I’m embarrassed to be a USC fan due to the booing and Fire Lane chants. I have been a fan for over 50 years and have 2 degrees from USC. I have seen lots of good and some bad from USC football teams over the years, but I have always supported the players and coaches and will continue to do so. I do believe these negative public messages are not helping either the team or recruiting process. The only person that can do something about the fans displeasure with the coaching is Pat Haden and his email is well known. It would seem to make a lot more sense to let him know what you think then embarrassing the team at a home game.
Fight On!
Maybe we should clap the fans off the field tell Lane better luck next time and oh shucks thats sports! Well that’s not how the Trojans I know respond! Messages need to be sent we are talking about the national representation of the university and millions of dollars at stake. The only one who should be embarrassed by this is the AD, the coach, and the team.
I could not disagree more. The actions of Lane Kiffin since he has been head coach have hardly reflected the glorious respected and feared nature of the Trojan program. Whether it is deflating balls, not responding to the media, poor play calling, or not picking a QB he has not even come close to representing the university, alumni, students, or its’ heritage. You people need to realize that this is USC football this is what this school prides itself on, and a message needs to be sent to Pat Haden. If you can’t take the heat get out of the kitchen, Kiffin has had his hand held through all of this excuses constantly made and he has been baby-ed. If this doesn’t light a fire on his ass and rebound whatever this season can come to then nothing will good riddens. Again this is USC football this is what he signed up for what he gets paid millions of dollars for, he doesn’t need any more excuses he needs to be pressed and then thrown out. I’m surprised he isn’t getting shelled with food and drink as he leaves the stadium this is embarrassing. This isn’t going too far its a bunch of signs and booing it could be way worse and if this were and SEC school you wouldn’t think twice about this behavior… Football is a tough sport tough crap if his feelings were hurt or it was disrespectful how do you think all USC fans feel- disrespected, embarrassed, having loyalty issues with their AD and coach?
I don’t condone booing or the chanting at a game, but we all have the right to our opinions sorry if that doesn’t jive with your’s, but then again I played football so I know how it feels to lose.
I’ve never booed or chanted negatively at a game, but I sure as hell got angry, especially when you consider or program’s proud history.
Nick, I’m with you completely on this one. Those calling for Lane’s exit think themselves righteous, and in their self-righteous display they degrade themselves to baboons unworthy of their title. It may be time for the university to install bread-showers in the Coliseum. Certainly the time of responsible fandom and true Trojan Pride appears to be, at best, in retreat.
Actually, YOU don’t get it!  Did Lane leave with the sanctions?  I can’t think of another coach including Saint Pete that could have managed this NCAA debacle.  We are all entitled to our opinions but the players and recruits on the sidelines don’t know WHO you all are booing.  They feel they have let us all down and I know for a fact that three players didn’t want to go to class on Monday not knowing what they would face.  GET A GRIP.  Do not embarass this university in public.  Do not embarass yourself in public.  Everyone else loves when we feed upon ourselves.  If you think this is such a plum prime job opportunity, you are delusional.  We will be rebuilding for another 2 years.  Support our players.  They are warriors.
May he have good luck wherever he goes, just not at my alma mater!

You are wrong on two counts; he is not a Trojan, he never played for us. He  is a Yankee traitor.
And most importantly, it is not his team.
It is the team of the alumni and the students.
And if they want a new coach, they have the glorious right as Trojans, to ask for one.
No, Nick doesn’t get it, Russell. He doesn’t get people like you; fair weather fans. As long as he is our head of coach, he deserves your loyalty. Period. Anyone can be loyal when things are going well, but that’s not when loyalty is tested. The true test of a man’s character is how he acts in the face of adversity. It’s those who show resilience in the most hopeless of times who ultimately come out on top. It’s moments like this that put Fight On to the test. This is what Fight On is all about. A well written article–one that all Trojans could benefit from reading in this trying time.
It is okay to ask or demand for the coach to be fired but NOT booing and doing the stupid chants AT the coliseum WHILE the team are playing. 
Think about the young athletes laying their hearts out on the field. They could use our support. 
Think about the recruits on the sideline. They need to know we are with them through thick and thin.
Create and sign a petition, buy a billboard, held a meeting with Pat Haden, do whatever you feel are  needed but please don’t add to the problem by not giving our team a chance to win while the team is playing at the Coliseum.
Be a first-class fan. Be a Trojan!
Wow does Nick not get it.
As a proud alumni I’ve never been embarrassed by anything about USC.  I wear Trojan pride on my sleeve.  Some of my earliest memories are watching Rose Bowls in the early 1970s with my parents.
Rolling over for the NCAA wounded me.  When the FBI finds no evidence of wrong doing you fight.
But never till a championship was tossed and talent wasted did I ever question our athletic heritage.  Lst season changed that.  I remember Ted Tollner, I went to school during the Larry Smith years (and bad as they were Smith took his first three Trojan team to the Rose Bowl).  Kiffin changed that, he is the problem, not the sanctions, not players that are arguably in the top 3 in the sport. In 2013 and were tops in 2012.
With options from Jon Gruden to Jeff Fisher to Jack Del Rio and others, and one of the 4 top jobs in all of college athletics ere is no excuse to settle for mediocrity let alone awful.  The chants started to late, Pat Hayden is ignoring his own heritage and needs to act or he needs to go to.  
I say let the chants continue, let them be so loud that Max steps in if the AD won’t.  Wear bags over your heads for this weeks impending loss to Boston College.
Let USC reclaim its rightful place as the sports premier program and end the SEC/NCAA $ driven hegemony. 
The problem isn’t the chant it’s that it took so long and is still far to quiet.

After an embarrassing defeat that saw USC’s two quarterbacks combine for the fewest single-game passing yards since 1998, USC head coach Lane Kiffin announced via YouTube Monday that redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler will be the team’s starter moving forward.
Time to shine · Newly annointed starting quarterback Cody Kessler has completed 18 of his 32 passes for 136 yards for one touchdown this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Though fans were frustrated with Kiffin’s inability to name a definitive starter at the beginning of the season, he defended his choice by explaining that he was confident enough in the abilities of both Kessler and redshirt sophomore Max Wittek to give them time on the field. But after a 10-7 loss to Washington State in which both players were ineffective and made costly turnovers, Kiffin described the passing game as “totally inept.”
Now, fans might be relieved to finally have a permanent starting quarterback, but many are equally annoyed with Kiffin’s refusal to answer why he chose Kessler over Wittek.
“I’m not going to get into [why Kessler was chosen] for protection of the guys,” Kiffin said. “We made a decision to go with Cody, and we’re excited about how well he’s gonna play Saturday.”
Perhaps Kessler’s edge in statistics can help explain Kiffin’s decision. Kessler started against Hawai’i and Washington State and completed 18 of 32 passes (56.25 percent) for 136 yards, with one rushing touchdown and one passing touchdown and two interceptions. Wittek came in during the second half in both games, completing a total of 8 out of 18 passes (44.44 percent) for 90 yards with no touchdowns and one interception.
Against Washington State, Kiffin’s conservative playcalling on offense indicated a lack of trust in both quarterbacks — Kessler threw mostly short screen passes, many of which were officially counted as rushing yards because they went backwards, and Wittek frequently handed the ball off to redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden, who finished with 151 yards on 32 carries.
Now that Kessler has been tabbed as the starter going forward, Kiffin plans to structure his gameplan around the                     6-foot-1, 215-pounder from Bakersfield, Calif.
“We’re going with Cody Kessler as our quarterback so we need to make sure that we’re doing things that he’s done really well,” Kiffin said.
Coming off of last season, Wittek might have been favored to start, as he started against Notre Dame and Georgia Tech after senior quarterback Matt Barkley sustained a shoulder injury. During camp, however, Kessler was praised for his smart  decision-making and improvement in arm strength, and was considered the frontrunner for the starting position.
When Wittek was asked during fall camp if he would transfer if not named the starter, he dodged the question, while Kessler clearly indicated that he would stay if he lost the battle. After officially naming Kessler the starter Monday afternoon, Kiffin acknowledged Wittek’s displeasure with the decision.
“We don’t expect him to agree with us,” Kiffin said. “He’s very competitive, like all the guys we recruit. They all should think that they should be the starter.”
Now that Kessler has been named the starter and Wittek the backup, Kiffin intends to redshirt Max Browne, the true freshman quarterback from Sammamish, Wash.
Dominant defense
Though the loss to Washington State seemed like a disaster on all fronts, USC’s defense, led by first-year defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, only allowed three points, as the other seven for the Cougars came from an interception thrown by Kessler that was returned for a touchdown.
“We played lights-out defense,” Kiffin said. “When we get the passing game fixed, we’ll win a lot of games with that.”
After two games, USC’s defense leads the country with 11 sacks, three of which have come from redshirt junior defensive tackle George Uko, which puts him tied for second in the nation. The Trojans also lead the nation in rushing yards allowed after giving up a total of just 30 rushing yards in two games.
The return of senior outside linebacker Morgan Breslin, who made his season debut after missing the first game due to injury, adds even more excitement to the defense. The preseason   All-American registered two sacks against Washington State and will look to contribute even more as he returns to full health.
Injury report
Though Breslin came back from injury this week, senior tailback Silas Redd has yet to play this season, as he is still recovering from knee surgery he had last spring.  Earlier this month, Redd visited renowned orthopedic surgeon James Andrews, who has garnered attention for his rehabilitation work with Redskins’ quarterback Robert Griffin III. Once back, Redd will contribute alongside Madden and freshman running back Justin Davis in what appears to be a much-improved running game for USC.
Other notable injuries include redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown, who was injured in the season opener at Hawai’i and missed the Washington State game, and cornerback Kevon Seymour, who played against the Cougars but was not completely healthy.

The USC men’s water polo team picked up right where it left off last year, going 4-0 over the first weekend of the season at the Triton Invitational in La Jolla, Calif.
Uncontainable · USC senior driver Nikola Vavic scored 14 goals in the team’s first tournament of the season. Vavic scored 83 goals last season, tying for the lead in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. – Daily Trojan file photo
On Saturday, the Trojans squared off against Cal Baptist and Loyola Marymount and won both contests with ease, coming out on top with scores of 19-5 and 21-7, respectively.
The real fireworks, however, came on Sunday, when coach Jovan Vavic’s squad scored a mind-boggling 50 goals while allowing just six from the opposition in two wins over then-No. 13 Air Force and Redlands.
The game against Air Force saw 13 different Trojans score, including three goals from highly-touted freshman two-meter Jon Walters.
Last week, Vavic stressed that the Trojans were going to need some less experienced players to step up if USC was going to be able to make a run at a historic sixth consecutive national championship. At that point in time, he was not completely sure who those players were going to be, but this weekend definitely helped clarify that situation.
“John Walters stepped up and played really well for us,” Vavic said. “He was really dominant in the two-meters.”
Walters had seven goals on Sunday, second only to senior driver Nikola Vavic’s nine. Vavic’s 14 goals over the weekend move him just 34 away from taking over as USC’s all-time scoring leader.
At first glance, it might seem like the Trojans played flawlessly. But glossing over details doesn’t win you five straight national championships, and the legendary coach Vavic is well aware of that fact.
“We missed too many short goals and we gave up too many,” Vavic said. “The guys were a little nervous and a little less patient when they got in front of the cage.”
Vavic and his staff clearly were trying to get to know their roster a bit more, and the rotations were indicative of that. The constant substitutions may have been somewhat of a factor in the rusty play for the Trojans.
Time in the cage was split almost equally between senior goalie James Clark and redshirt sophomore goalie Aleck Ryner in the first game. In the second game, junior Paul Mitre was even given a chance to enter the mix, and he performed well, recording three saves to seal up the 27-4 win over Redlands.
“We didn’t always play our best players, as we are trying different people,” Vavic said of his rotation. “And when you do that, you will make mistakes.”
The squad was also given a bit of extra practice, as they concluded Sunday with a scrimmage against crosstown rival and reigning national runner up last year, UCLA. With a total of four official games and one scrimmage in the books, coach Vavic now has a better feel of what his rotation for the season will look like.
Whether they were perfect or not, the four victories extended the Trojans current winning streak to a staggering 35 games.
Though quite the impressive feat, the accomplishment and maintaining of the streak is of little importance to the 12-time national coach of the year.
“You have to focus on the next game, and you really can’t think about the winning streak,” Vavic said. “When we lose, it’s just going to be another loss. All you can do is play against the next team. But if we can win all of them, that would be even better.”
The Trojans will continue play this weekend at the Inland Empire Classic in Pomona, Calif. Their first game will be Saturday at 1:30 p.m. against the UC San Diego Tritons, and the Trojans will also play Pomona-Pitzer, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Whittier. The final two games will be played on Sunday in La Verne, Calif.

USC’s top male and female athletes from the week of Sept. 2-8 were announced Monday, as men’s water polo senior driver Nikola Vavic and women’s volleyball sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio each took home USC’s Athletes of the Week honors.
Bricio led the Women of Troy to wins over TCU and Marquette en route to being named the Most Valuable Player at the Marquette Challenge. Against the Horned Frogs, she posted another impressive performance with 16 kills and 15 digs, while maintaining a .275 hitting percentage. Bricio was the catalyst of the USC offense, averaging 4.95 points per set over the team’s three matches, including 16 more kills and a .324 hitting percentage against Northern Illinois.
On the men’s side, it was no surprise to see Vavic, son of USC head coach Jovan Vavic, at the top of the stat sheet after the men’s water polo team concluded their undefeated weekend at the UCSD Triton Invitational. The 2012 Cutino Award finalist helped his team open the 2013 season in dominating fashion, scoring 14 goals over the Trojans’ first four wins of the season.
Vavic posted five goals on day one and caught fire for nine more on the second day of tournament play, netting four goals against No. 12 Air Force and adding five more against Redlands. Along the way, he reached yet another milestone in his impressive career, moving up to the No. 3 on USC’s all-time scoring list. His efforts helped the team extend its remarkable winning streak, which now stands at 35 games dating back to 2011.

On Sep. 9, the Daily Mail reported the death of an 8-year-old Yemeni girl on the first night of her arranged marriage to a 40-year-old man. Rawan suffered brutal internal injuries after her husband forced himself upon her. She died shortly after this horrific episode. This tragedy should remind the international community to heed the prevalence of child marriage in order to eradicate it.
Too Young to Wed, a movement started by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), sheds light upon the issue of child marriage by chronicling cases of child marriage through photography. Browsing the UNFPA’s website certainly comes as a shock to viewers: On its pages, innocent young girls with rosy cheeks and gentle eyes stand beside men maybe three or four times their ages. It’s nauseating.
A young girl named Tehani, a 6-year-old child bride, said to UNFPA, “I was so scared. I was shaking, shaking. And whenever I saw him, I hid. I hated to see him.”
Tehani is six. Six is an age when children like Tehani should play hide and seek with their schoolmates. Age six is not the time to hide from a husband.
Child marriage robs these young people of futures. When they commit to their husbands, they also sacrifice careers in order to cater to the needs of their significant others. According to PBS, child marriage has other detrimental effects, such as the spread of HIV/AIDS and the increase in maternal and infant mortality.
Most people understand the outrageousness of child marriage. Yet expunging this sweeping phenomenon requires awareness and action. Educating more progressive societies of these problems allows others to see the importance of intervention. UNFPA has started this journey through their eye-catching photography exhibitions and online campaigns. Additionally, UNFPA plans to tackle the problem of child marriage through financial and academic support of potential child brides to help them escape their tragic situations.
But these organizations cannot fight on their own. In order to combat child marriage, the international community must pressure these countries to enact stronger laws, as well as take great care in enforcing those laws. According to the Daily Mail, though “a February 2009 law [in Yemen] set the minimum age for marriage at 17, it was repealed and sent back to parliament’s constitutional committee for review after some politicians called it un-Islamic.”
Enforcement is one of the greatest problems in other countries such as India and Nepal with child marriage cases. For example, though laws against child marriage exist, The Times of India reported that the Asian subcontinent is still responsible for 40 percent of the world’s child marriages. Evidently, these bureaucracies do not prioritize the protection of girls such as Tehani. Thus, society must task a larger force — particularly, the United Nations — in vigorously monitoring and prosecuting these criminals.
The Huffington Post interviewed 18-year-old Savita Singh, another victim of child marriage. Fortunately, Singh’s story hasn’t ended as tragically as most girls’, but her words really cut to the core of the problem.
She said to the Huffington Post, “This is my time to ‘eat and drink’ — my time to have fun, my time to be in my parents’ house. This is my time.”
She’s absolutely right. And it’s our time to fight for her rights.

The British child brides: Muslim mosque leaders agree to marry girl of 12… so long as parents don’t tell anyone
    Two imams were prepared to officiate wedding of underage girl
    More than 1,000 of the 8,000 forced marriages of Britons each year are believed to involve girls of 15 or under
By Ryan Kisiel
PUBLISHED: 04:47 EST, 9 September 2012 | UPDATED: 18:53 EST, 9 September 2012
……………..
MPs on Tuesday called for a controversial imam, or Muslim religious leader, to be banned from the Netherlands because of his support for the marriage of young girls.
Mohamed al-Maghraoui caused a storm in Morocco in 2008 when he published a fatwa – or religious edict – saying it is acceptable for girls to marry at the age of nine. He is due to attend a five-day conference later this month to celebrate the opening of an extension to the As Soennah mosque in The Hague.
…………..
A growing legion of Muslim men from the Mideast and Europe are scouring Syrian refugee camps in order to purchase underage girls, some as young as 12, as child brides, many of whom end up being sold for use in temporary “pleasure marriages.”
msa,
So when your prophet, Mohammed, was 54 years old and consummated his 11th marriage (this one to Aisha) when she was only 9 years old you are telling us she was physically, mentally, psychologically fit to fully understand and embrace the act of fornicating with a man six times her age?
You might as well try selling us a bridge if you think we’ll buy that one.
……………
Muslim Student Assoc.,
What message does it send to Muslims when your prophet forces himself on prepubescent girls?
You can actually do something about this by joining 34 Million Friends of the United Nations Population Fund. During the last 10 years I’ve spoken at least 3 times at USC. UNFPA fights the wordwide battle for gender equality, for reproductive health, for family planning and of course in the fight against child marriage. For these young girls this is pure terrorism.   For 10 years we’ve been asking 34 million Americans for at least one dollar to take a stand for the women of the world. We’ve raised a lovely $4.25 million so far.
any marriage that has element of force on either of the couple is un-Islamic, any marriage that any of the couple is not either physically, mentally, psychologically fit is un-Islamic, so if you want to fight against under age marriage please do it with sincererity of purpose, without infringing on the right of Muslims both male and females.

In 2008, UCLA chemistry professor Patrick Harran was charged with violating state occupational health and safety standards, which allegedly caused the death of staff research assistant Sheharbano “Sheri” Sangji. Cases of accidental death often set out to blame someone for the tragedy; Harran, who has been charged with four felony counts after Sangji perished in a lab explosion, was simply her employer.

A judge recently refused to dismiss the charges against Harran stemming from Sangji’s death more than four years ago. On Dec. 29, 2008, 23-year-old Sangji suffered fatal burns when she accidentally pulled out the plunger of a plastic syringe she was using to transfer tert-butyllithium (t-BuLi), a chemical compound that ignites upon exposure to air. At the time, she was wearing nitrile gloves, but no lab coat. The solution spilled onto her hands and torso, causing her polyester sweater to burst into flames. Over half of her body was burned and she died 18 days later.
According to the Los Angeles Times, if convicted, Harran could face close to four and a half years in prison.
In the first U.S. case where a university professor is faced with a felony complaint in the wake of an employee’s death, Harran is charged with “willfully violating state occupational health and safety standards,”  according to the Times. He allegedly failed to provide hazardous chemical safety training, require body protection for employees exposed to hazardous substances and have an effective injury-prevention program.
What gets lost in this story is that this was a tragedy of more than one individual’s mistake. It is simply unfair to heap all blame on Harran, and no matter the verdict, the most significant outcome for years to come should be making sure such a tragedy does not occur again. In order to do that, we must closely examine what went wrong and realize that lab safety is a top priority.
Though the cause of the accident is still ambiguous, preventative measures could have been taken from the beginning. One of them is wearing a lab coat. If Sangji had had a flame-resistant coat on, her injuries would have been less severe.
On the training front, prior to the incident, the UCLA Environmental Health & Safety Office had conducted general lab safety training at the beginning of every quarter while principal investigators provided lab-specific training, according to Chemical & Engineering News. Because Sangji started work at the lab on Oct. 13, 2008, she missed the EH&S training and would have attended in January. Harran and UCLA maintain that she had had laboratory-specific training to complete her work safely.
Prosecutors say, however, that there is no evidence that Harran or anyone else trained Sangji in handling of t-BuLi, according to the Times. The defense argues that because she had done the experiment on a smaller scale before the accident and was successful, Harran had reason to think that she had been properly trained previously.
Yet, assumptions are never safe. Though it seems normal that Harran believed from Sangji’s excellent background in chemistry that she was a “seasoned chemist,” as she had graduated from Pomona College with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry five months earlier, his job as her supervisor should have been to be absolutely certain that she had received proper training at the university. Also, Sangji must have had a lack of understanding of the hazards of her work to not have worn a lab coat. According to the C&EN, she had not worked with pyrophoric materials during her work for chemistry professor Daniel O’Leary at Pomona College or for Norac Pharma post-graduation.
Harran’s lab also had violations two months prior to the incident, according to the C&EN. The red flags included keeping more than 10 gallons of flammable solvents outside of flammable storage cabinets and lab researchers, including Sangji, not wearing personal protective equipment.
Nevertheless, many factors also contributed to that fatal explosion, and Harran should not be made out to carry the full weight of the accident. Granted, he did have a misstep in not being stringent enough, but arguably, the UCLA Chemical Safety officers who inspected the lab on Nov. 5, 2008 could have been more vigilant in correcting the violations. Sangji herself, while her employer did not specifically require a lab coat, could have taken more precaution. The two postdoctoral fellows present at the scene could have put her under the emergency shower but instead attempted to smother the fire with a lab coat.
Multiple aspects of lab safety requirements need to be changed, and not just in that specific lab. This accident could have happened in many other places. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a federal investigative agency, uncovered “safety gaps” in university labs that threatened more than 110,000 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the United States after the tragedy, according to The Bay Citizen.
The accident has brought under scrutiny the dangers of the laboratory, where many people routinely handle toxic, flammable and explosive compounds without proper training or supervision. EH&S now provides general safety training monthly. Researchers cannot receive keys to their labs until the training is complete, according to the C&EN. This case is significant because it will set a precedent for the standards in a lab, including what’s legal and how far a lab supervisor’s responsibilities go.
In order for positive changes to continue, lab preceptors, supervisors, inspectors, research employees and students alike must all do their part to make safety a priority in the laboratory.

Nice article. I wasn’t aware that Sangji worked in pharma before she joined Harran’s lab. In response to glo’s comment, he/she apparently does not know the culture of graduate chemistry. Most professors who run academic labs rarely step into the lab’s that their graduate students are working. Did Harran know Sangji was using a pyrophoric on such a large scale reaction? Probably. Is it his responsibility to hold her hand and stand right next to her to tell her what to wear/do? Ask any organic chemistry professor at a university, and they will say “no.” She worked in industry post-bac, for pete’s sake.
Ah, youth, where is the wisdom in youth. The professor should be held responsible, this is  the same as a parent leaving a loaded gun around for a child to pick-up and shoot someone or themselves.  The parents are held responsible.  He knew that was a dangerous chemical capable of injury or death.   He or someone in his lab tried to cover it up when they took the door off to clean up the scene.
