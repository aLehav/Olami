A previous version of this article contained inaccuracies. Mosaic used $3,200 from Jack Agarwal’s security deposit to repaint his house, not $5,000 as originally reported. Additionally, Mosaic treated Jenna’s house for termites on Dec. 29, 2018; the original article reported that the termite problem was unresolved. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors. 
This article was updated on May 17 after an additional interview with Mosaic to provide clarification and context. Statements added in after publication have been noted in the updated version. 
After coming back to USC in Fall 2017 from studying abroad, senior Jack Agarwal was happy to move into an apartment on Menlo Avenue. 
Agarwal and seven other students rented the property from Mosaic Student Communities, knowing that competition for housing near campus was fierce. 
But by the end of the year, Agarwal, who graduated in Spring 2018 from the Marshall School of Business, was certain he would never rent from the company again.
Among numerous maintenance problems Agarwal described in an interview with the Daily Trojan, the property’s gate allegedly remained broken for two months. In that time, Agarwal’s bike was stolen, and he and his roommates could not access their car.
At the end of the year, Agarwal said Mosaic removed about $3,200 from the security deposits to the repaint the entire house. Agarwal notified Mosaic he was willing to take the company to court, but he backed down after feeling like he didn’t have a strong enough case.
Agarwal’s experience is not uncommon. Mosaic Student Communities, a property management company that markets primarily toward USC students, manages over 50 properties in the USC area.
“We care a lot about our reputation,” said George Alva, the co-owner and co-founder of Mosaic. “We care a lot about our product. We’re continuing to grow and the property management business is a challenging business.”
But a Daily Trojan investigation found that Mosaic has received numerous complaints from student residents, some of which have escalated into lawsuits. Lack of communication, failure to meet state building codes and standards and a perceived shortage of staff members have caused problem after problem for Mosaic tenants, many of whom don’t know where else to turn.
In conducting its investigation, the Daily Trojan reviewed court documents, looked over property, inspection and building records and interviewed two dozen students who have lived in Mosaic properties.
Over a dozen students said Mosaic kept their security deposits to repair damages — when instead they were used for routine maintenance projects that should have been taken on by the company itself. One student was charged $400 for a paint job. 
At the same time, students said they experienced long delays in maintenance orders and repair requests. After finding black mold on their property, four students waited weeks before Mosaic addressed the issue. One student waited nearly a month before Mosaic fumigated her termite-infested house. Two students have yet to hear back from Mosaic about cockroach problems. Another student is waiting for Mosaic to address a growing moth problem.
One student had to pay out-of-pocket for her scratched car, after Mosaic said it could not be held liable for the loose roof tile that caused the damages. Courtney Jurasko, Mosaic’s senior property manager, said in an email that it was an “act of God.”
The company says it doesn’t own all of the properties it manages, making handling student complaints difficult at times. It added that it only keeps security deposits for repair purposes.
But these problems, while specific to Mosaic, represent a larger issue in an area where tight competition for housing has led to skyrocketing rents. USC guarantees student housing for incoming freshmen for a maximum of two years, and students who can’t find on-campus housing are left to settle for whatever is available in the surrounding neighborhood, often signing leases half a year in advance. But many feel that housing companies take advantage of this desperation.
“I think it’s just a repeating trend that us students are generally seen as powerless or we don’t have a lot of ability to push back against the policies or the actions of these big housing corporations,” said Sam Maracich, a senior majoring in electrical engineering who has rented from Mosaic for two years. 
Slow responses
According to the California Department of Consumer Affairs, landlords must maintain their property and keep up with basic repairs to ensure the habitability of their residences. 
But within months of moving into a Mosaic property in August, Jenna, a junior majoring in business administration and real estate finance, said she found a termite infestation that went unsolved for over a month.
“I started seeing these little grounds on the floor,” said Jenna, who asked that her last name be withheld out for fear of reprisal from Mosaic. “I called a termite inspector, and they said the house should be tented. Mosaic hasn’t done anything about that.”
Mosaic provided documentation showing that the house was treated for termites on Dec. 29, and that its own agency said no tenting was needed for the level of termites present. 
Jenna reported the termites on Nov. 20 and found mold in her apartment on Dec. 11. After calling a mold inspection agency, she was told that the mold was likely due to the property’s age and poor maintenance.
According to California landlord-tenant laws, landlords must provide a written disclosure about mold hazards when they know, or have reason to know, that the mold poses a threat to the tenants’ health. 
Alva said Mosaic took allegations of mold very seriously, but said in a post-publication interview that Jenna never provided proof of mold to the company. 
“[Toxic mold] can lead to serious lung infections, and often results from landlords’ neglect of pipes leaking the walls, leaky roofs and unsealed walls [that lack a protective coating],” according to California Tenant Law, a website operated by the Carlson Law Office.
When Jenna reported the issue to Jurasko, the senior property manager, she said Mosaic would address the issue immediately.
“Nothing ever happened after that phone call even though I texted, emailed, called. Nothing,” Jenna said.
Justice Schiappa, a member of cinema fraternity Delta Kappa Alpha whose house is owned by Mosaic, said Mosaic has failed to address a faulty window for two years and to provide a proper lock for the front door.
“I’ve come up to that door and it’s just been unlocked from the outside … homeless people [have] walked in,” said Schiappa, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting.
According to the California Civil Code, landlords must meet certain conditions of safety and habitability. This includes installing proper security measures and lock systems to prevent criminal activity. 
“I’m trying like hell to move out because I don’t feel safe living in a Mosaic-owned property,” Schiappa said. 
Mosaic said in a post-publication interview that the front door lock can be difficult to use, but added that the historical nature of the house makes it difficult to install a new doorknob with a modern locking mechanism. The company also said that it encourages residents to avoid the front door and use two other entrances that have stronger locks. 
Montana Kanen, a senior majoring in economics, said her broken dishwasher flooded her house, leading to a cockroach infestation. But she also lived with a broken heater for a month even though, according to California law, landlords must provide “functioning plumbing, heating and electrical facilities.” 
Mosaic said in a post-publication interview that the company sent someone to fix Kanen’s heater twice, both times within 24 hours of an online report being filed — though Kanen maintains that she told the company of her broken heater by phone and did not hear back for a month. Additionally, Mosaic said a third-party inspection report from a pest control vendor cited “no pest activity” in Kanen’s unit. When Mosaic’s maintenance team eventually came to fix the issue, it set off the smoke detectors, which the company then removed.
According to Kanen, Mosaic did not install new smoke detectors for a month, despite a California code that requires buildings have smoke detectors at all times. The company re-installed them after the day after Kanen experienced a gas leak. 
“My boyfriend walks in and he’s like, ‘Holy shit, it reeks of gas,’” Kanen said. “I call Mosaic — again, really hard to get through. They told me [to] call the gas company [because] it’s not their problem.”
Mosaic said the company resolved the gas leak within two hours of receiving the call.
Petitioning for change
After living in a Mosaic-owned property during her senior year, USC alumna and former Daily Trojan editor Erika Lee was charged $605 from her security deposit for extra cleaning services and damage done to her room. 
Lee, who said she hired a professional cleaner before she moved out and made sure that nothing in the room was broken, started an online petition after she graduated in Spring 2018. The petition said Mosaic repeatedly charged students for supposed damages and normal “wear and tear,” amassing over 70 signatures.
Alva said that for properties that are managed but not owned by Mosaic, the owners of the properties have the final say in issues regarding security deposits.
“At the end of the day, the owner needs to approve [the tenant concessions],” Alva said. “If he doesn’t improve it or she doesn’t improve it or they have issues or there’s pushback, that puts us in a difficult position because we need to deliver that message to the students.”
A month after the petition began, Mosaic responded, saying it wanted to process the charges “accurately and fairly.” Lee later announced on the petition that she received her full security deposit and has since marked the petition as resolved. 
Jason Hwang, who graduated last year and commented on the petition, said he was able to ignore some of Mosaic’s issues — such as how it never addressed repairs like broken bathtubs and sinks — until the company took around 53% of his and his roommates’ over $3,000 deposit.
Hwang said he felt the company’s charges were unclear and that Mosaic failed to address problems he noticed before he moved in as well as repairs he asked for during his stay.
“[Mosaic] didn’t seem to patch up the whole place perfectly when we moved in and now that we’re moving out, suddenly [they’re] making us pay for damages that really even aren’t our fault? No one came to do a full inspection during our two years staying there,” Hwang said.
After negotiating for three months, the company eventually gave Hwang 80% of his deposit back.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Mosaic stated that “neither Mosaic nor its clients keep or make money from security deposits.”
Legal action
Some students who’ve lived in Mosaic-owned properties have turned to the legal system to address their grievances.
Since 2013, Mosaic Student Communities has been named as a defendant in four lawsuits in California Superior Court, two of which were filed in October.
Sammi Ali, the plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against Mosaic, lived in a Mosaic property twice before suing the company Oct. 3. Ali, a graduate student studying molecular biology, lived on a property that Mosaic recently acquired. Within a month following the change in management, Ali found that Mosaic had thrown out many of his belongings, including furniture and antiques that were placed outside under a tarp. 
According to Ali, none of his roommates were asked or notified by Mosaic about the removal of the belongings prior to the event. 
“I explained to them, in any scenario they tried to argue, I [said] either way, you needed to give notice,” Ali said. “The fact that you just started managing the property, you’re only one month in, you should already know better than to start doing whatever you want.”
After Ali sued Mosaic Student Communities in a small claims court, Mosaic was ordered to pay $6,000 for damages.
Fatimata Sanogo, a graduate student studying epidemiology, also filed a lawsuit against Mosaic in October after her security deposit was withheld. 
According to UC San Diego’s guide to landlord-tenant law, tenants can have a claim against property owners if a landlord “withholds all or some of a security deposit for damages that do not exceed normal wear and tear.”
Sanogo alleged that Mosaic overcharged her and her roommate for regular wear and tear on the apartment during her stay even though she left the property in pristine condition. 
Mosaic settled the case in December for around $400 each for both her and her roommate.
When asked about the legal action, Mosaic said it was against the company’s policy to comment on previous or ongoing lawsuits.
A competitive market
Mosaic told the Daily Trojan that it has close to 15 employees and that the company has a high turnover rate. Mosaic said they had over 500 residents in 2014 and have been steadily growing since. Many students found that Jurasko was the only Mosaic staffer they interacted with, leading them to feel like the company did not have enough full-time employees to meet the needs of its tenants.
“I think the employees are overburdened. I think they’re understaffed,” Maracich said. “Courtney is managing far too many properties than she’s able to.”
But issues surrounding student housing companies aren’t exclusive to the USC community. In 2013, USA Today published a story about Pennsylvania State University and West Virginia University students who did not get their security deposits back. The story quoted Gregory Nichols, a civil law attorney at Tulane University, who said some landlords target students because they don’t know how to fight back.
“In a lot of cases, students have moved away, so they are not even in town — or in state — to take a landlord to court, leaving them scot-free,” Nichols told USA Today.
Some universities have taken steps to help students find equitable off-campus housing. New York University has a list of vetted and safe student housing corporations on its website. UC Berkeley has a list of tips on how to approach security deposits and ensure students are not overcharged.
In Los Angeles, where the housing market is often complex and stressful, the University has not yet provided new tenants with guidance and resources to navigate the multitude of housing companies available. USC did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding its responsibility to provide students with help finding off-campus housing.
“At the end of the day, tenants pay the rent, they pay the mortgage, they pay all the bills,” said Mosaic co-owner Carlos Delherra. “That’s something we try to remind our employees about all the time. We see our tenants and our residents truly as business partners.”

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team capped off the regular season with a narrow 9-8 victory over No. 3 UCLA on Saturday, marking the Trojans’ sixth straight win against the Bruins. The Trojans head into the playoffs with a 23-1 record, including a 5-1 mark in conference play.
Although both teams created some scoring opportunities early on, the Trojans were better able to capitalize on their chances while defending the Bruins’ attack on the other end of the pool. Four different Trojans contributed a goal in the first period, giving USC a 4-2 advantage heading into the second. Senior goalie Amanda Longan came up with a big stop in the final seconds of the quarter on a penalty shot that could have cut the lead to 1.
The Trojans continued to dominate the scoreboard in the second period, widening their lead to 3 goals. In the second half, however, the momentum began to shift in UCLA’s favor. The Bruins scored 2 unanswered goals to bring them within 1 of the Trojans.
As UCLA mounted the pressure, the Trojans recognized the importance of staying focused and adapting their approach to counter the Bruin offense.
“I think we all set our goals straight and really focused on defense,” junior utility Maud Megens said. “We tried to focus more on their important players and play higher on them and let freshmen beat us. I think we did pretty well, although we forgot to play offense a bit.”
Before UCLA could find a tying goal, the Trojans regained a big lead and came out ahead 9-5 at the start of the fourth. Sophomore driver Paige Hauschild played a major role in this offensive surge, delivering 3 straight goals for her team and 4 on the game. 
However, this wasn’t enough to put the Bruins away in the final frame. UCLA scored 3 unanswered goals to make the score 9-8 with two minutes to go.
“I think [UCLA] really stepped it up in the fourth quarter and attacked us harder than before,” Megens said. “They posted up a lot of people and we got excluded, so we got into problems because people didn’t want to leave the game with 3 exclusions. We really had to manage and switch on defense, and therefore, it was hard for us to play our own game.”
However, USC was able to close out the game due to some enormous stops from Longan, who had 12 saves on the game.
Despite almost conceding their lead in the final minutes of the game, the Trojans look to be a dangerous team heading into the playoffs.
“I think we really played together as a team,” Megens said. “We set each other up very well, and a lot of players on our team scored. And I think because we’re such a strong team, and anyone can do anything, we can be surprising and unpredictable for other teams.”
By defeating UCLA, the Trojans secured the No. 2 seed in the MPSF tournament in Palo Alto Friday. They will square off against No. 7 Indiana in a quarterfinal match at 11 a.m.
If both USC and UCLA win their first matches this weekend, the two teams could meet again in Saturday’s semifinal game.
“I think we should be aware of the fact that we can’t count on [them playing] the same the whole game,” Megens said. “They can switch up their game, and we should prepare for that, and we should anticipate that with even more effort.”

The No. 5 USC men’s volleyball team fell to No. 4 Pepperdine 3-0 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference championship match Saturday night in Malibu. 
This was the Trojans’ third MPSF Tournament runner-up finish since the tournament started in 1993. While this was Pepperdine’s fifth MPSF Tournament title, it was also its first since 2008. 
Senior outside hitters Jack Wyett and Gianluca Grasso led the Trojans on offense with 13 and 10 digs, respectively. Senior outside hitter Ryan Moss contributed nine kills and eight digs, while sophomore setter Chris Hall added nine digs of his own. 
On the opponent’s end, redshirt senior outside hitter David Wieczorek had 18 kills, seven digs and 2 aces while hitting .571 to lead the Waves in their victory over the Trojans. Senior outside hitter Michael Wexter had 10 kills and four blocks, senior outside hitter Kaleb Denmark added 8 kills and seven digs of his own and sophomore libero Spencer Wickens had seven digs to contribute to Pepperdine’s win. 
“I think that we didn’t play our best game, and they played their best game for sure,” Grasso said. “Playing at home for them was a huge advantage. On our part of course there are things that looking back I think that we could’ve done better, but we have to look forward now.” 
The Trojans started strong in the first set, recording 4 service aces on their way to a 10-6 lead over the Waves. Pepperdine began to catch up and trailed closely behind until they were able to pull ahead for a 17-16 lead. The Trojans tied the set three more times, but Pepperdine stayed ahead for a 25-23 finish. 
The Waves kept their forward momentum in the second set, scoring the first 3 points and quickly garnering a 6-1 lead. They widened their lead to 21-12 before the Trojans started catching up to close in on the Waves 23-19. It was too little to late, however, as Pepperdine still managed to pull out a 25-20 win. 
The teams traded leads for much of the third set, with 12 ties in the frame. At 25-25, a kill by Wieczorek and a combined block by Chamberlain and Wieczorek won the tournament for the Waves with a 27-25 set. 
“It was pretty special,” Pepperdine head coach David Hunt said after the game. “It was special for me to do this in our home gym and to know that we’re going to the NCAAs, and to do it with Marv [Dunphy] on the bench. This team has put in a lot of hard work to get there.”
Despite the loss, Grasso said the 2019 season has been a turnaround year for USC men’s volleyball. 
“Making it to the finals says it all, we worked hard for this and we made a big push at the end winning 11 out of 13 games so it was just about the momentum,” Grasso said. “We kept winning and we kept growing as a team.” 
The outcome of this game gave Pepperdine an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. USC announced Sunday morning that it had earned an at-large bid and will face Lewis University in its first game with a rematch against No. 1 Hawaii looming. The Trojans have made 14 appearances in the NCAA tournament and won four times. 
Preparation will be key this week leading up to the match. 
“Definitely practicing in that Long Beach gym, getting used to the pyramid and getting used to the atmosphere down there,” Grasso said. “We can also always work on communication between our team. I think we just have to work hard as a team this last week so we can come out ready to play on [April 30].”
Head coach Jeff Nygaard is proud of his team’s persistance throughout the season. 
“Our team has worked hard this season and has had many outstanding wins, it is validating to be able to continue our journey by being selected to play in the NCAA Championship,” Nygaard said. “Congratulations to the other teams who made the tournament, it is an exceptional field of competitors. We have played particularly well lately and we are peaking when it matters most. I believe we have our best volleyball ahead of us.”
The Trojans face Lewis April 30 at 5 p.m. at the Pyramid in Long Beach.

I remember the first story I ever wrote for the Daily Trojan, — how could I forget it? It was the first week of my freshman year, and the sports editors asked if someone could cover football practice the next morning. As the eager, naive freshman that I was, I signed up.
The next day, I showed up to Howard Jones Field bright and early to no fewer than 15 news trucks lining McClintock Avenue. Every local news channel was there. ESPN was there. Steve Sarkisian, the head football coach at the time, was making his first public statement since he appeared on stage intoxicated in front of boosters during the Salute to Troy event. The story made national headlines and would eventually lead to his termination.
And there I was, a wide-eyed freshman, covering my first story for the campus newspaper. If you look at the video that ESPN embedded above its story on its website, you will catch a full glimpse of me, standing to the left of Sark, sporting a bright blue T-shirt and neon green backpack. I looked like a total freshman dork.
Unbeknownst to me, that kicked off four years of working at the Daily Trojan, which has defined so much of my time at USC. It also led to this column, where for the last seven semesters I’ve been privileged to have a weekly platform to spew my hot sports takes.
But this sign-off column isn’t about me. It shouldn’t be. It is about the people I have met, the stories I have written and the moments I have witnessed over the last four years. And man, there have been so many that the challenge lies in where to start.
I could start with Jake Olson, the blind long snapper on the football team who has been an incredible inspiration in his four years here. He was the subject of my first-ever feature. We sat on the patio outside Heritage Hall, his guide dog Quebec by his feet, and I listened to him describe his journey, struggles and persistence. I was at the practice where Sarkisian called on him to deliver his first snap during a live field goal drill, and I was in the press box two years later when he snapped for the first time in a game. 
I will never forget either moment, and neither will anyone else in attendance. Nor will I forget Olson’s quote after the game on appearing in his first game, a line that sucked the air out of a packed room of media members. 
“I just think there’s a beauty in it. If you can’t see how God works things out, then I think you’re the blind one.” 
Amen, Jake. 
I could go with Jack Jablonski, the hockey player who was paralyzed after a hit during a game in high school. I still get emotional thinking about his mom choking up during our phone interview, describing the frantic moments after the injury in which he looked at her and said, “Mom, I can’t feel my legs.”
His hockey dreams shattered, his life altered forever, Jablonski persisted. He enrolled at USC, interned with the Los Angeles Kings and started a foundation to raise funds toward a cure for spinal cord injuries. My profile on Jablonski won a California College Media Association Award, but all the recognition should go to Jablonski for his story, for allowing me access to grab a glimpse of his life, to follow him during one of his grueling thrice-weekly rehab sessions and see the daily struggles that come with paralysis. If there is one person who will beat the odds and walk again, it is Jack.
Or I could open with Sam Darnold, the phenom quarterback who I had the pleasure of covering when I was sports editor in 2016. I was in Utah for his first-ever start. USC lost that game on a rainy, miserable Friday night in Salt Lake City, dropping its record to 1-3. The Trojans were off to their worst start since 2001, and I remember thinking, “This poor redshirt freshman is going to get killed.”
Nobody was prepared for how exceptional Darnold was. This man became superhuman the rest of the season, making spectacular plays on a weekly basis. I loved his laid-back, lowkey attitude, the way he treated an upset over No. 4 Washington on the road like he won a pick-up game. Perhaps that’s what made him effective as a leader, the quiet confidence that his teammates automatically respected.
USC won its last nine games, culminating in a Rose Bowl victory over Penn State for the ages. That is the best sporting event I have ever attended, and it will take a pretty damn good game to beat it. I thought I was experiencing an earthquake in the press box when the sold-out Rose Bowl shook after Matt Boermeester kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired.
There are so many other ways to begin — with Bennie Boatwright and his work ethic that will lead him to a successful professional basketball career; men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield, who sat with me for not one, but two extensive profiles on his efforts to revamp the program; sports information director Tim Tessalone and his entire team, who are so accommodating in working with student media to cover this prestigious athletic program. It is fitting that my final byline in this paper later this week will be a profile of Tessalone, who has experienced more than 40 years of sports memories at USC. 
I can debate how to begin recapping my time around the USC sports landscape, but there’s no doubt how I will end it: with a heartfelt note of appreciation. Appreciation for all the incredible people I have met, the friends and memories I have made covering this program, for the passion of the USC fan base through good and bad times, and lastly, for the opportunity to go along for the ride, to grow as both a person and a journalist and witness some amazing stories over the last four years. Freshman dork me would be so proud.

From blaring horns to belting voices and big bodies, Lizzo comes out swinging in her new album, “Cuz I Love You.” 
“I’m crying cuz I love you,” Lizzo yells to begin the titular track. Drums and horns barrel throughout, sustaining the song’s high energy the entire time. The song showcases Lizzo’s vocal control, comfortably sitting in her falsettos and holding notes for longer than you’d expect.
Lizzo’s signature positivity, confidence and empowerment builds throughout the album from “Soulmate” to “Juice.” She’s reclaiming her body, personality, relationships and self. Especially in “Juice,” she owns the party — even dressing up as an actual disco ball for her performance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in February.
Lizzo doesn’t just want to make herself feel better, however. On the tracks “Better in Color” and “Like a Girl” she makes space for everyone. Produced by Oak Felder (who produced Demi Lovato’s self-love party-anthem “Sorry Not Sorry”), “Like a Girl” turns the once insulting phrase into empowerment. “If you fight like a girl …do your thing run the whole damn world,” Lizzo encourages listeners. 
Lizzo manages to create a galaxy of emotions in her short, 30 minute album. She comes to terms with her ex, “Jerome” and even finds a new “Soulmate” in herself. From regret to passion, Lizzo’s feelings are not only matched, but emphasized by the production and genre. On “Tempo (feat. Missy Elliot),” she raps confidently, owning music that’s easier for her to dance to. On “Better in Color,” she includes hints of gospel to reinforce the spirituality that comes with self love.
In Lizzo’s world everybody is invited to the party, even some pretty recognizable names. With features from Missy Elliot (“Tempo”) and Gucci Mane (“Exactly How I Feel”), Lizzo manages to share the stage while keeping the spotlight on her. Missy Elliot’s verse on “Tempo” is memorable and fun, and Gucci Mane’s time on the album is a braggadocious lesson on owning your success. 
Born Melissa Jefferson, Lizzo has released EPs and singles for years, opening for HAIM on their Sister, Sister, Sister Tour over the summer of 2018. While her older tunes like “Good as Hell” and “Boys” have graced many a movie end-credits scene, “Cuz I Love You” proves Lizzo is more than just popular bops. 
The range of an artist like Lizzo does not enter the industry often. While she can let loose, Lizzo knows when to tighten up. Classically trained in flute, Lizzo brings her trusty partner, Sasha Flute (an actual flute with an Instagram page), out for a feature on “Heaven Help Me.” 
Lizzo’s depth, perspective and wisdom is proven through her gratitude for the littlest things. She serves as a reminder that self-love isn’t easy to reach but is worth the effort. 
Currently at the No. 1 on the iTunes charts, Lizzo sits comfortably next to Beyoncé, whose Homecoming album was bumped to number two after Lizzo’s release. Not bad for a debut album.

Yesterday marked the end of the 20th annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. While attendees spent their time ingesting copious amounts of alcohol and music in the sweltering desert sun, I spent the past two weekends asking myself: How do festivals as massive as Coachella affect the environment? More importantly, what kind of ecological impact does the music industry as a whole have, and how can it reconcile this with concerns surrounding climate change? 
While the urgency of global warming has permeated industries like consumer goods, fashion and technology, the topic has largely gone undiscussed in the entertainment industry. Both inside and outside of the business, many do not typically consider the carbon footprint of common industry practices. 
However, it’s time to account for the impact music entertainment has on our planet. It is important to consider electricity use during recording sessions, carbon emissions from CD and merchandise production, as well as emissions from transportation of these products by cargo ships, trucks and planes. On tour, artists use an immense amount of energy for sound and lighting, and tons of carbon is emitted by the transportation of their sets and for travel.
There is a multitude of environmental factors associated with sustaining a musician’s career; as climate change remedies become more crucial, the music and industry will need to research and implement ways to make music entertainment environmentally sustainable. Environmental research organizations like Julie’s Bicycle and A Greener Festival are already offering numerous solutions for reducing energy usage and carbon emissions in music.
First, let’s trace the journey of a typical album cycle and analyze the environmental impact of each step. Albums begin with the recordings. In spans of a few months to multiple years, musicians trek between recording studios to complete their projects. Moreover, while at the studios, artists can spend multiple days recording, mixing and mastering tracks. Unsurprisingly, this requires a significant amount of energy and produces lots of atmospheric carbon. In total, the process contributes about 10,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to studies done by Julie’s Bicycle on the industry in the United Kingdom. 
Once the project is completed, the recordings have to be pressed into CDs and vinyl records; they are also stored in large warehouses before being distributed to retail stores. Julie’s Bicycle found that the materialization and packaging of physical records accounts for 65,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, and manufacturers produce about 10,000 tons. In addition to the emissions caused by music distribution centers (6,000 tons), and transportation of the product (16,000 tons), buying even one CD can still greatly increase a consumer’s carbon footprint.
Next comes album promotion, where live events get their time to shine. The music industry should focus on making tours and festivals greener; live events are already the most lucrative source of income for musicians and industry professionals, and they are continuing to grow in popularity. Nonetheless, their carbon footprint is problematic. In a 2010 study, Julie’s Bicycle found that large commercial music tours in the U.K. emit an average of about 2,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year (that is 2,000,000 pounds per tour, per year!). A 2007 study showed that air travel alone for record label, management, agency and promotion personnel produces upward of 3,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. 
One-off festivals can be just as bad. Oxford University researchers discovered that transporting Glastonbury Festival attendees can produce about 45,000 tons of carbon dioxide, accounting for 68% of the festival’s total greenhouse gas emissions. 
Water trucking also largely contributes to the festival’s carbon footprint, as are waste disposal and abandoned tents (historically, about one in five tents have been left on the festival grounds after the event has ended). Glastonbury also uses up to 30,000 megawatts of electricity during the event, which is the same amount of energy as some small cities in the U.K. 
Are these just lost causes? Are the entertainment industries — particularly music — so traditional that there are no ways to get similar results with less ecological impact? Well, fortunately, all it takes is awareness and a mitigation strategy. 
In regards to diminishing the carbon footprint of music studios, Julie’s Bicycle suggests reconstructing recording facilities to reduce electricity. This can entail repainting walls to maximize natural light and utilizing smart technology that automatically shuts off after long periods of standby.
The most effective solution for minimizing physical music’s carbon footprint might be not buying it at all. Luckily for the environment, purchases and permanent music downloads are growing obsolete by the day as streaming becomes ubiquitous. The problem for the business is that physical music generates more revenue, per unit, than streaming. The key to solving this issue would be to push streaming services to increase their royalty payments, as well as find a way to revitalize digital downloads. Julie’s Bicycle also recommends rethinking CD and vinyl packaging to include biodegradable materials. 
For festivals and touring, reducing carbon footprints will require overhauls of energy and transportation. Many festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury have already implemented green initiatives at their events to minimize carbon footprint. Glastonbury has urged visitors to manage waste and tents, and Coachella, a desert festival, has smartly implemented solar and wind energy. Moreover, adding newer technology that lets festival guests generate electricity themselves will help.
The music business is designated as a low-carbon industry, but there are still steps that can be taken to reduce ecological damage. As global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, we must work to make our enjoyment of musical expression as environmentally sustainable as possible. Our world continues to spin even when the records do not.

Every April 22, people celebrate our planet. This perfect rock is an Eden for life, combining just the right amount of different elements needed to support life as we know it. It’s not too hot, not too cold — it’s the “Goldilocks Zone.” 
In 1970, at the height of the counterculture movement, a senator from Wisconsin started Earth Day after witnessing the 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara. Sen. Gaylord Nelson was inspired by the student-led anti-war movement at the time, and he thought that same energy could be used to teach people about environmental concerns. 
He convinced conservative Congressman Pete McCloskey to serve as his co-chair and recruited a Harvard graduate student named Denis Hayes. They decided April 22 would be the prime date for the holiday — it fell between spring break and final exams, so students nationwide would be on campus. 
According to Earth Day’s official website, 20 million people took to the streets that first Earth Day. By the end of 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency had been formed and the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts had all been passed. 
In 1990, Earth Day went global, with 141 countries and 200 million people worldwide celebrating their shared planet. 
Earth wasn’t doing too well in 1970 — pesticides were killing birds, soot piled white birds black with gunk, smog was suffocating — and it’s not much better off today. While there have been major environmental achievements, like drastically improving air quality in Los Angeles and creating safer water sources in some parts of the world, this planet is in major trouble.
This year’s Earth Day theme is “Protect Our Species,” and rightly so with multiple species going extinct each day, some of them before we even have the chance to learn about them. 
“Normally, between one and five species will go extinct annually,” an Earth Day fact sheet reads. “However, scientists estimate that we are now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the normal rate.”
The fact sheet only gets more depressing as you read on. Insect populations have decreased by 75% in Germany, and 75% of primates species, humans’ closest relatives, are in decline. More than 650,000 marine mammals are caught in industrialized fishing gear each year. One in eight bird species is threatened with global extinction. Many of the world’s big cats, like tigers, leopards and cheetahs, have high probabilities of going extinct in the next decade. And the list goes on. 
A study published in 2006 in the journal Science predicts that, if we do not slow commercial fishing, all of the world’s fisheries will have collapsed by 2048. 
If humans continue living disposable lifestyles and disregarding their long-term impact on this fragile, beautiful planet, it will spell disaster. In 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change announced the world’s population only has 12 years left to dramatically change its habits to curb the effects of climate change. 
The planet is already warming, and the effects are already visible.Uncontrollable wildfires. Deadly hurricanes. Shifting weather patterns and rising sea levels make these already destructive natural disasters even more threatening.
Earth Day was created to raise awareness of the way people interact with the environment. It has done great things in its 49 years. But one day is simply not enough to adequately consider negativity of human action on the environment. 
Humanity cannot survive without Earth. People are currently threatening the “just right” conditions for life every day. 
Try not to use plastic on Earth Day, walk instead of driving or don’t eat meat. Why not try these small actions multiple days a week? Learn about a state representative’s stance on climate change and policy and call them. Let them know this matters. Be that annoying friend who has fun facts about the environment, and not-so-fun facts about how human actions are irreversibly damaging the environment. 
Climate change is the single most important issue of the century. Humans need to band together and work to change their habit to help change society and stop this life-threatening, man-made disaster.

Parents snap photos as they walk their kids to school, high school students host recycling drives, Angelenos take advantage of Free Metro Day on their way to work and USC students gather to plant community gardens — these are all common sightings on a single day of the year: Earth Day. But as residents of the second largest city in the United States, we could be better using the resources, systems and infrastructure available to us and making more sustainable choices every day.
As students, it can feel like there’s no way to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the city we live in. City planning projects take years to develop and implement, not to mention the time spent creating policy and raising funds required to execute them. Urban infrastructure is often already set, and outdated systems can only be incrementally changed. But we can still make environmentally friendly, sustainable choices. We can utilize well-designed systems within our campus and our city to encourage the funding, development and innovation of these systems. 
Simple everyday switches like sorting recyclable items out from trash or taking shorter showers also assist USC’s systems for waste disposal and water conservation. Because on-campus living covers the cost of major utilities, students can’t control how much the University spends on electricity but can cut their use down to lower the total energy spent.
However, beyond the boundaries of campus, USC students need to do a better job of using city infrastructure to make sustainable choices, particularly when it comes to transportation.
Most USC students don’t realize how intentionally Metro stations are positioned around campus and how far the Metro system extends. For $1.75, you can take the Expo Line to the Red Line to Universal Studios. And for $0.75 more, you can take the 460 Disneyland Express bus for a straight shot to Disneyland Park.
Los Angeles Department of Transportation’s DASH service is severely underused by USC students, as well. Line F stops at nine places around campus and goes all the way north to 3rd Street for $0.50, or $0.35 with a TAP card. By taking the bus more frequently and pushing for USC subsidized transit cards for students, we could cut back on the University’s carbon footprint and set a precedent of public transit use.
But L.A. is a sprawling city, and there are areas that are difficult to reach without transferring lines several times or spending the bulk of one’s day in transit. If you need to use a car, consider a ridesharing or carpooling to save gas and cut down on carbon dioxide emissions.
Another way to promote sustainable urban planning is by getting involved at every level of planning and policy. From encouraging the University to install more solar panels and invest in renewable energy to attending city hall meetings to voice support of more bike lanes, there are ways for students to assist in large-scale decisions toward sustainability.
The goal of good urban planning is to create a city that promotes the welfare of its residents, and this includes helping to preserve the environment. Considerations of eco-friendliness, sustainability and efficiency should not be relegated to one day a year. They should recur in our conversations about the future of our city. While an individual’s lifestyle changes may seem inconsequential in the vast stretch of L.A., they can be monumental in changing trends and systems. L.A. is trying to shift away from private transportation and consumerism toward a socially and environmentally conscious one, and as the future of L.A., our choices as students the first step.
