President Joe Biden ran on the mantra that the 2020 election would be a “battle for the soul of the nation.” Now, as he takes office, it is time to repair that very soul.
Former President Donald Trump has not served to make matters any easier for Biden. His divisive rhetoric over the past four years empowered the racists, conspiracy theorists and insurrectionists in the United States. It only worsened in his waning months as he baselessly claimed he won the election — which polls say over 50% of Republicans believe — and incited the riot and invasion of the U.S. Capitol.
Trump’s failure to attend Biden’s inauguration sent further signals to his base that he does not recognize Biden as the legitimate president. The former president’s actions have done anything but help unite our country, and instead only made it more difficult for Biden to be an effective leader.
Biden admitted in his inaugural address that unity in the United States may feel like a “foolish fantasy” to many due to the current political climate. Perhaps it is a foolish fantasy, as QAnon continues to grow, and constant threats of rebellion from alt right groups remain, along with the U.S. congressmen and senators who refuse to heed to fact. 
Given the situation, it may seem hard to believe that the United States can become wholly united again. In fact, it is possible that the easiest thing is to accept that there will always be a portion of the country that believes in an alternative set of facts, and we will never be able to reconcile our differences.
However, as Biden alludes to in his inaugural address, we must do our best as a country and as citizens to oppose the forces dividing us. Even when it may seem like a hopeless effort, we must try as best we can to reach the growing number of Americans who are politically on the fringe. This effort must start with Biden leading by example.
Biden must use his platform and power as the leader of the free world to promote the spread of facts and trust in U.S. institutions and government. This should include speeches and messaging, executive actions to stop the spread of fake news without infringing on First Amendment rights and an enhanced focus on civics education in American schools.
Fake news, conspiracy theorists and extremism may not be tangible issues but they are dangerous nonetheless. Biden must work to unite the country in order to heal the nation’s soul and to be able to pursue his own policy agenda with the entire country recognizing him as their leader.
The new administration should address this divide forcefully and swiftly so that it does not continue to grow. Although much of this extremism lives on the internet, it is starting to become a more palpable threat as shown by the number of protests against Trump’s loss and the storming of the Capitol building.
Although Biden must take the lead in unifying the U.S., all citizens should contribute. This could be through reaching out to a friend or neighbor who has doubts about the sanctity of our elections or government or engaging in dialogue with members of the opposite party. Hearing out people’s opinions, seeking to understand them and simply having a constructive conversation could help heal divides or serve to educate others.
It is a difficult time in the U.S., but if the right steps are taken and the people tackle this divide head on, it can become an opportunity to better the country and help form a more perfect union.

Despite being referred to as a “senior center” by the same publication which called for a more inclusive and appropriate approach to aging a month prior, the administration of President Joe Biden is truly one of the oldest in the history of the United States. Biden himself will be the oldest president in U.S. history at 78 years old, beating former President Donald Trump who was only 70 years old during his inauguration. 
Promising to appoint the “most diverse Cabinet in history,” Biden has appointed several individuals that he believes are representative of the country he will hopefully serve upon his inauguration. 
Many political analysts have noted that this cabinet, albeit diverse, resembles an “old guard” philosophy. According to Merriam-Webster, the term “old guard” refers to ideas originating from “the conservative and especially older members of an organization” or “a group of established prestige and influence.” The nomination of Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary seems to be the only highlight of youth, yet this older cabinet has many young Democrats concerned about whether Biden’s administration will rebuild and move forward into the future or simply regress to traditional views. 
Frankly, these decisions are for good reason. I’m not going to babble on about how it’s a guarantee that this new administration will pave the way for a stronger democracy — I’m no crystal ball, I’m just an aspiring gerontologist. We are simply unsure of the precise rationale behind some of these cabinet decisions; however, we should have a bit of faith in the politicians we’ve chosen through this forsaken, far from perfect, election structure. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “So what am I supposed to do about it? Why shouldn’t I stress too much about these older folks taking office? How about the youth vote that carried Biden to the presidency?”
Those are great questions to kick off this column again. Let’s take a trip down memory lane. 
The past four years — especially the past few months — have been wild, unpredictable and hectic. From a bat in China to a mob in the Capitol, humanity and the United States have really been through a lot. Maybe this cabinet is simply what this nation needs right now. In contrast to the prior administration, they possess years upon years of political experience, many hailing from the Obama administration. Their resumes are truly stacked.
In many ways, this revival of the “old guard” is a simultaneous regression and progression — a sort of static that gives us an opportunity to bounce back rather than continue further downward into conspiracy and violence. It’s a regression literally, in the sense that we’re taking former officials and placing them back into similar positions, yet it’s a progression in terms of diversity and moving forward from the previous administration. 
From gerontology, we know that older people are not at all stagnant; they learn and grow just like anyone else. This administration is fully capable of learning from recent history and building upon what they know already works. But for now, Biden’s priorities should be aligned with getting the country back on track before pioneering a new future. Current times are radically different from anything we’ve seen in history, which ought to be kept in mind as we rebuild our communities. 
This does not guarantee that life will be fine and dandy for the next four years. We know that some of Biden’s nominees, like Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, have political and corporate ties that may conflict with the interests of the people — sadly, that just seems to be the way with politics nowadays. However, we are poised to see dramatic leadership changes throughout Congress and the various levels of government with the new administration, and while change isn’t always necessarily a good thing, think of it as a “changing of the guard.”
Biden brings in plenty of experience to the table himself, but with this comes some concerning policy shifts over the years. For quite some time, his controversial Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was a stain on his political career, as well as his previous stances on LGBTQ+ marriage laws and foreign trade. Today, Biden is often referred to now as the “centrist Democrat,” and we see the side of Biden that stands for “We the People” and embraces new cultural and social practices. It is this transition, or character arc if you may, that is a testament to why we can place a bit of trust going forward in this “old guard.” 
This administration has the potential to rejuvenate the American way of life through the thick of this pandemic and long afterwards. Biden and his team bring not only the wisdom and experience but passion and dedication, which will hopefully carry us for the next term. 
When we’re appointing the secretary of space defense or whatever position is coming next in our nation’s cabinet, we can look back to the administrations of today and fondly recall, “Back in my day…”

When Daniel Donohue sat down for a Skype audition for ABC’s new primetime show, “The Chase,” he never anticipated he would get the chance to compete head-to-head with his childhood idols. 
Beginning his journey with the “Jeopardy!” College Championship, to now battling Brad Rutter, James Holzhauer and Ken Jennings — some of the biggest names in “Jeopardy!” history — Donohue has skillfully mastered his way up the trivia game show circuit. 
The first-year Gould School of Law student is set to play a high-pressure game on the newest episode airing Thursday. The aim is to answer trivia questions faster and more accurately than the champions, who are dubbed the “chasers.” The game is fast-paced and high-stakes, with questions even valued at $25,000 each.  
Donohue said it was the speed-based format that appealed to him.
“I think that benefitted me because when you’re trying to go as fast as you possibly can you don’t have time to get in your head,” Donohue said. 
When it comes to tackling questions that could come from any and every category, Donohue said he didn’t believe in memorizing facts and cramming information.
“Some people go on game shows, and they really hope to have like the ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ moment where every question is based on something in their life, and they get really lucky. And you know, but that’s not gonna happen,” Donohue said. “It kind of helps to just be generally curious about everything.”
Donohue believes that a natural intuition, built with habitual practice, is an essential technique to build performance.
“There’s this almost sixth sense that you have to have: ‘Do I know this? Even if I don’t have the correct answer at my fingertips in this nanosecond, will I be able to pull this answer out of my brain? In the next five seconds? Is this something I’ve heard before? Is this information that I have?’” Donohue said.
He describes it as a subconscious surrendering to his mental and physical being, especially during high-pressure situations. At times his fingers and some distant part of his mind would know the answer, and it would propel him to buzz in even without being consciously sure about it.
“But there was something that my thumb, just my thumb on the buzzer, caused me to ring in. And I just made up what I thought might possibly be the answer. And I was right,” Donohue said. “It’s the sixth sense of like, somehow my thumb and my brain knew that I knew.”
Donohue was introduced to competitive trivia in middle school through Quiz Bowl, and he continued involving himself in these national competitions all throughout middle school and high school. 
His selection for the “Jeopardy!” College Championship was what introduced him to the world of televised and monetized trivia competitions in the form of game shows. 
He entered the Los Angeles trivia circuit through the O’Brien’s Irish Pub & Restaurant in Santa Monica, which is a hub for many former “Jeopardy!” contestants. He got extensively involved in the Pub Quiz and through that, made a strong network within the trivia community. 
As an undergraduate radio, television and film major at Northwestern University, he found a passion not just for the fun of the game but also for the life on set— the way the shows were produced, directed and executed. 
“Twenty-one-year-old Dan gets flown out to Los Angeles for ‘Jeopardy!,’ and I get to walk on to the backlot at Sony Pictures, because that’s where they taped ‘Jeopardy!’, and I get to go to a soundstage. And there’s lights and there’s a director going ‘roll camera!,’ read the intro and there’s a makeup person doing your makeup,” Donohue said. “This is literally what I was studying in school.”
Donohue pointed out that the lack of scripted production propelled a major influx of unscripted content. A large number of game shows were being greenlit over the summer resulting in casting calls being circulated extensively in the trivia circuit. 
Donohue believes his immensely thorough knowledge of film and theatre, which also happens to be his strength in general trivia, general experience on set and as a performer and his career in TV hosting is what gave him an edge in the audition process.
“How many of [contestants] can say that they had the experience multiple times of being on a working Hollywood set and interfacing with producers and hosts and writers and everyone that’s involved in making a production like ‘The Chase’ or ‘Jeopardy!’ or ‘Millionaire’ happen?” Donohue said.
Quizmaster at O’Brien’s Irish Pub & Restaurant and USC Law alumnus, Brian Fodera can attest to Donohue’s vast expanse of knowledge and skill. 
“He has encyclopedic knowledge of musicals, … and is also a huge sports fan,” Fodera said.“There aren’t a lot of people that are sports and theatre experts — that’s something unique about Dan,. It sets him up to do well in something like ‘The Chase’ where the questions come across a whole broad swath of categories.”
According to Fodera, a sense of “intellectual curiosity” and a habit of reading is a vital trait to have in order to master the game of trivia.
“Curiosity, curiosity, curiosity — cause that’s the way to learn things,” Fodera said. “They’ll not only become better at trivia, they’ll be a better informed citizen. And we certainly need that.”
While Donohue notes that he is not the best in trivia, and that there may have been many who auditioned that were much smarter than him, he said the primary factors that game shows are truly looking for are televisable content and entertainment. 
“There are a lot more people who are really good at trivia that aren’t necessarily the most camera-ready people in the world … so they don’t make for primetime television,” Donohue said. 
Close friend and School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Jerome Vered, who Donohue credits as being a guide and the person who introduced him to the O’Brien’s community, agrees that Donohue’s personality and natural talent makes him the ideal contestant for “The Chase.”
“I’m sure he could have gotten on to “The Chase” when he was in college and I don’t think he would be intimidated,” Vered said. “He’s very appealing, … he’s really fun and very animated, very expressive and fun on TV, which is why they cast him, I’m sure” 
Donohue said it was surreal to play against champions he’d seen on television as a child — those that in many ways inspired him to enter the field. 
“The three guys that are on as the ‘Chasers,’ these three greatest ‘Jeopardy!’ contestants of all time, I grew up watching them compete. So how could I resist an opportunity to go head to head,” Donohue said. 
While Donohue can’t say whether or not he won until after the episode has aired, he has an optimistic attitude toward the outcome. 
“The way I look at it is it’s all found money, right? I came to this experience without this money, anything I win would be gravy. So I’m just happy to be here having the chance to win it.”
