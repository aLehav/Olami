After meeting in a public policy class on nonprofits last year and realizing the rising problem of college homelessness, juniors Abigail Leung and Esther Cha wanted to make a difference. Together, the students co-found Trojan Shelter, a home for college students experiencing housing insecurity. They plan to launch the program in Fall 2019. 
“There’s a rising college homelessness issue,” Cha said. “Even at USC, there’s approximately 2,000 students who are homeless or [have experienced] homelessness in the past 12 months. That’s just not OK.” 
Cara Esposito, an adjunct professor who taught Leung and Cha at the Price School of Public Policy will be the coordinator for the shelter. 
“These are extraordinary students,” Esposito said. “They really are going to change the world.” 
After hearing from guest speaker Louis Tse, who co-founded UCLA’s Bruin Shelter, in their public policy class, the two were inspired to create their own shelter for USC students at a church in Koreatown. The name of the church has not been stated officially. 
“The church [in Koreatown] initially offered their space to the Bruin Shelter, but they were too far away,” Leung said. “So, we were able to make that connection, and in August 2018, we sat down with the church and decided to move forward with the project.” 
As part of fundraising efforts for the shelter, Cha and Leung organized a competition with Bruin Shelter to see who could raise $15,000 first. Each shelter raised $32,000 in one month via CrowdRise, an online crowdfunding website. The shelters received donations from the Thornton Foundation, Students 4 Students (a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending college homelessness) and Home Depot. 
According to Cha, fundraising is a top priority for jumpstarting Trojan Shelter, along with ensuring infrastructure to house the students in need is in place.
“Because it’s housing students, there’s not a lot of room for error,” Esposito said. “We’re really trying to build up the whole infrastructure of the shelter before we open our doors.” 
The co-founders are currently looking for student volunteers to help out at the shelter.
“It’s obviously going to be a place for people who are homeless to come find refuge and a safe place to stay,” Cha said. “But more than that, we want it to be a place where our students can grow and learn and become advocates for this issue.”  
Student volunteers will serve on the executive board committee and help coordinate the shelter’s opening. The organizers hope to get student volunteers trained so that they can become full staff members by Fall 2019.This will involve staying overnight with the residents and helping prepare meals.
“Something we really want for the Trojan Shelter is for the residents and staff to become very close,” Leung said. “We’re hoping to have a lot of bonding activities led by shelter staff.”
Along with recruiting volunteers, Leung and Cha are focused on redecorating the space and equipping the shelter with basic resources, such as food, toiletries, towels, bedding and mattresses. 
According to Leung, Trojan Shelter plans to partner with other organizations such as Share A Meal and Swipe Out Hunger to help gather food-related resources. The shelter is also working on building partnerships with the University through the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the Keck School of Medicine. 
The shelter also plans to participate in Homelessness Awareness Week next semester.
“We are a USC organization, but we’re not just open [to] USC students,” Cha said. “We’re serving any college student between the ages of 18 to 25 who [is] enrolled in at least two units.” 
Cha said Trojan Shelter’s priority is to raise awareness for college homelessness and provide a safe community for college students who face housing insecurity regardless of which university they attend.
“There’s an issue at USC with homelessness but we’re not just addressing that,” Cha said. “This is a bigger issue.”

Netflix debuted its new original series “Justice” Monday, a show which unfortunately failed to effectively resonate with viewers. What could have been a revolutionary series depicting a powerful Arab female lawyer in United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi was actually a pulpy melodrama filled with flat characters, poor acting and unintriguing plotlines. 
The Arabic series, supplemented with English subtitles, follows Farah (played by Fatima Al Taei), an American law school graduate who has just returned home to the United Arab Emirates to start her own practice. The series explores issues of autonomy, relationships, truth, obedience and religion as she attempts to balance her family’s interests with her own. 
The first episode starts with promise, featuring incredible shots of Arabic architecture, culture and landscape. Intricate camera work and interesting plays on shadow and light give the scenes an enticing warmth. The cinematography within the first few minutes of the show is breathtaking and indicative of the rich Middle Eastern culture in Abu Dhabi. The show pays special attention to the portrayal of forensic evidence and legal documents, painting an aesthetically pleasing and comprehensive image of Farah’s work environment.
In conjunction with the artistic direction, “Justice” does a wonderful job depicting the beauty of Arab societies, going against the stereotypically negative media portrayals of Arab individuals. Particularly, Farah exemplifies Arab women are not categorically objectified and repressed in Muslim countries, a significant step forward in expanding the representation of non-Western characters on television. 
However, this is where the series’ positive qualities end. The concept of the show — a woman fighting for justice in a male-dominated workforce, facing all kinds of adversity from both her family and her clientele — is certainly powerful. Despite its strong premise, however, the series lacks the emotional depth and resonance necessary to retain viewership. 
The characters, with the exception of Farah, are mostly static. Their expressions seem artificially manufactured and their dialogue disingenuous. Exchanges are often rushed, which make it seem as if the actors can only recite their lines rather than truly perform them. This does an immense disservice to characters like Hasan, Farah’s father, who could have been an intellectually engaging, tenacious male lead if not for his bleak portrayal.
Most of the scenes throughout the show often only serve to amplify the dramatic disparities among the actors’ skills. Though “Justice” attempts to be a drama, it errs on the side of a bad melodrama. The musical choices, coupled with the actors’ emotionless reactions to overtly dramatic discoveries, make the show nearly impossible to watch. The sparse scenes that do elicit spectators’ attention and interest, such as when Farah and her sister tenderly discuss their respective life goals and dreams, typically fall flat at the end of the dialogue, leaving the audience unfulfilled. 
The lack of empathetic qualities in the characters, combined with unmoving scenes, results in a lackluster story. Characterized by predictability and marked by disconnected plot points, the show ultimately lacks a sense of significance. Viewers instinctively want to root for Farah as she pursues her dreams, but the repetitive and dull narrative of the series makes this challenging.
Netflix’s new Arabic drama fails to reach its potential as a revolutionary depiction of an Arab woman in a position of power because of its shallow plot, stale characters and exaggerated scenes. The show’s only lifeline, Farah, seems poised to grow as a dynamic character over the course of the series; however, her storyline is not enticing enough to cancel out the show’s significant gaps in content.

Last summer, the University quietly amended its speech code to make it easier for the administration to handle on-campus protests. But there was just one problem. The University’s policy change neglected a higher rule: the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
USC decided over the summer to require students to register protests with the University a whole two weeks in advance. 
It’s unnecessary and dramatic to  say that efficiency and regulatory control of the freedom of assembly is the first step to dictatorship, though it is true. Instead, we can start by arguing such policies are fundamentally contrary to the very mission that universities aim to accomplish. USC’s mission statement is: “We are private, unfettered by political control, strongly committed to academic freedom and proud of our entrepreneurial heritage.” 
The primary function of   “academic freedom” is for students to challenge the status quo. Students have been at the forefront of demonstrations and nationwide movements, and this certainly hasn’t always been to school administrators’ taste. Be it protesting the Vietnam War in the 1960s or gun laws just last year, students are frequently the ones who ignite the fire of dissent. Often, their passion is translated to actual policy in Washington, D.C. 
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization that ranks students’ First Amendment rights among university campuses across the country, moved USC to its “red” category after the changes were made, indicating that the University’s speech code “clearly and substantially” restricted students’ freedom of speech. 
The University administration was not happy. It responded to FIRE’s statement by saying the reason for the changes was to avoid potential conflicts and ensure adequate staffing. 
“The University of Southern California strongly supports the free speech rights of our students,” Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry wrote in his response to FIRE. “And this extends to campus demonstrations.”
Safety should never be taken for granted. After all, rights come with responsibilities, and the First Amendment explicitly says our rights are limited to assembling “peaceably.” Protestors that ignore their responsibility to remain peaceful can and should face consequences. The University certainly has the obligation to keep its students safe and ensure the safety of everyone involved in protests, but it cannot mask this duty by seizing the power to regulate who protests when. The two duties can — and must — coexist. 
After receiving backlash, the University is beginning to backtrack on the policy change. USC announced it would reword its speech code so that demonstrators would not have to register in advance. While the exact changes are still unclear, the Daily Trojan reported that even without the registration requirement, the policy will still “strongly encourage” students to register their demonstrations beforehand. 
This is the very most students should settle for. If USC truly wants to be a University that promotes “academic freedom,” it must limit how much it regulates on-campus protests to, at the very most, “strongly encouraging” pre-registration.
Fittingly, the First Amendment was the vehicle used to fight against the University’s regulation of the First Amendment. The pushback from students and the public, and the subsequent response from the administration, shows how important a collective voice can be. 
We must keep the First Amendment alive at USC because when the First Amendment loses, we all lose.

The media is everywhere in 2019. There are hundreds of thousands of websites just a click away, each ready to deliver its own version of the news to you. The low barrier for entry to the journalism industry means anyone can call themselves a reporter, no matter how accurate or biased their stories are. 
We often call journalism the watchdog of powerful institutions, keeping them accountable by shedding light on their operations and exposing wrongdoing. 
But here’s the issue: News media can be a powerful institution of its own. A 2012 Business Insider report said that 90 percent of all media was controlled by just a few conglomerates — News Corp (Fox News, The Wall Street Journal), Disney (ABC, ESPN), Time Warner (CNN, HBO) and Comcast (NBC, Vox Media). Granted, that report was written seven years ago; as more independent sites emerge, these conglomerates start to lose their stronghold on what we read and watch. However, these institutions still represent an overwhelming majority of American media. 
This can be dangerous — while journalism intends to seek and report the truth, bias inevitably emerges, no matter who the reporter is or how powerful the newspaper behind them is. This is fine as long as consumers have access to a wide variety of perspectives, but media conglomeracy means we aren’t seeing stories that challenge our perceptions as often.
A good example of where these media monopolies can go wrong is The Daily Prophet, a fictional wizarding newspaper from the “Harry Potter” series. I grew up creating my own versions of the newspaper, wanting badly to continue the stories of the Wizarding World long after the books ended. 
Looking back, the Prophet was truly the epitome of what news media shouldn’t be. As far as we know, the Prophet is the only daily newspaper in the British Wizarding World. When there’s so few news sources for wizards to read, it’s very easy for the Ministry of Magic (the Wizarding World government) to exert control over the paper and, thus, the views of the people. 
One of the narratives lurking throughout the background of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” is the Ministry of Magic’s constant denial of Voldemort’s (the series villain) return. The Ministry uses the Prophet as its mouthpiece to reject Harry’s insistence that the dark wizard foe really has come back. 
Because the dominant narrative created by the Prophet was that Harry was lying, everyone percieved that as truth. This caused the threat of to Voldemort loom large, with the majority of the wizarding population blindly trusting the Prophet.
Something very similar seems to be happening with certain populations in the United States and the dominant  television channel Fox News, which is owned by News Corp. 
News Corp was started by a man named Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch started his media empire in Australia — his dad owned just one newspaper there and Murdoch’s business acumen allowed him to not only bolster that newspaper’s success, but to buy enough media assets that News Corp alone now accounts for 59 percent of all news media circulation in Australia.
Murdoch also bought multiple papers in Britain and then came to the United States, where News Corp owns properties with brand name recognition and huge audiences.
Murdoch built his news empire with savvy investing practices, but what’s interesting is how he capitalized on sensationalism to sell as many papers as he could. He directed his newspapers to write exaggerated, eye-catching headlines and focused his newspapers’ coverage on scandals and controversy. After the Murdoch treatment, newspapers like the New York Post  went from near-failure to record-high circulation. 
The Daily Prophet, and journalists like Rita Skeeter, follow a similar path. Harry and his friends grew to hate Skeeter throughout the series because she would twist their words to write scandalous — even fallacious — stories. The Daily Prophet would publish her reporting with huge, sensational headlines, like “Harry Potter: Disturbed and Dangerous.”
Murdoch’s news was also often politically motivated, and here’s where Fox News comes in. The channel has over 2.4 million primetime viewers on average, and its conservative bent is no secret — in the past, Fox News has made erroneous claims suggesting that a snowy day outside proved that global warming isn’t real or that Black Lives Matter is a violence-inducing racist hate group. Both of these statements are obviously false, but viewers who exclusively get their news from Fox have no reason to question it. 
And as with the Ministry of Magic and The Daily Prophet, President Donald Trump seems to have a close relationship with Fox News — they cover him more favorably than other news outlets do, and Trump often praises the channel and its shows: After his inauguration in 2017, Trump tweeted in praise of the network’s ratings, while calling CNN “fake news” in the same tweet. 
So we’re seeing the same thing happen: Fox News, because of its massive media reach, is controlling the narrative of politics for many Americans, and leaving them in the dark to the truth, in the same way that The Daily Prophet left wizards in the dark about Voldemort’s return.
As such, Americans must be conscious news consumers. In this column, I’ll explore the ways that news media — from the Daily Trojan to The New York Times — can do better, and what precautions Americans can take to ensure that their news diet is balanced and effectively informs them of current events. 
Having a robust news media landscape is vital for a democracy to function. If journalism isn’t kept in check, America will lose its        already-waning trust in the media, and there’ll be no one left to keep our other institutions in check. 
Karan Nevatia is a sophomore writing about media ethics and literacy. He is also an associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Dear Rita Skeeter,” runs every other Thursday.

The Undergraduate Student Government announced two more presidential tickets for the 2019-20 academic year on its website Tuesday. Though an uncontested presidential ticket was announced last week, two write-in presidential and vice presidential candidates released statements.
USG funding directors Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin are running for president and vice president, respectively. Their candidacies were announced via press release Monday; John Lynch and Ryan Goldsher announced theirs through a post on Lynch’s personal Facebook account Tuesday.
Both tickets filed their campaigns after the official registration deadline. According to the press release, the Trenton-Mahin campaign said its candidates will be included on the ballot despite filing election paperwork after the official deadline.
“The two candidates decided to run in the elections to provide another option to the previously uncontested ticket,” Stone and Tahsin wrote in their statement. “Through their experiences within and outside of USG, Trenton and Tahsin believe that they can offer a fresh perspective to student leadership and to the larger USC community.” 
Stone, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, said he decided to run after finding out that there was only one candidate for presidency. 
“We felt very passionate that [the student body] deserved to have another choice and have a right to have a competitive choice,” Stone said. 
Stone and Tahsin’s platform focuses on establishing greater administrative accountability, expanding student health resources and improving accessibility, as well as addressing the campus climate and boosting sustainability efforts. 
“After we heard that there was only one [ticket] … a lot of what we discussed was that we wanted to present students with an active choice that ultimately represents them … on campus,” Tahsin said.  
Stone said the campaign will highlight the need for providing resources to expand on the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion’s efforts, as well as encouraging comprehensive research of more initiatives and programs to improve student well-being. 
The other presidential ticket includes Lynch, a junior majoring in screenwriting, and Goldsher, a junior majoring in political science. 
Lynch, who became known on campus for his involvement with the USC Memes for Spoiled Pre-Teens Facebook group, has three platform points: to increase in mental health resources, to create more recycling opportunities on campus and to establish more transparency between the student body and USC administration. 
“I’m so anxious to make a change,” Lynch said. “I just wanted to step in and correct the direction of the Trojan Family … because I don’t like some of the things I see.”
In a statement on Facebook on Tuesday, Lynch and Goldsher said they planned to improve USC by “defeating terrorism,” closing USC Village and giving free haircuts to all students. 
“And we saw that like [USC] spends a lot of money and resources on making the campus like beautiful but like our own students aren’t that beautiful,” Lynch said. “So one idea we had is like we want to offer free haircuts to students and if they don’t like their hair cut, for example, we can give them like a fedora, or like something like Jason Mraz would wear.” 
Lynch said his campaign includes expanding gamedays to have multiple tailgates throughout the week. 
“[Goldsher and I] hate the big crack down on game days, so like we want to have multiple game days a week like Monday through Friday there should definitely be some sort of tailgate going on every day in case people don’t have class,” Lynch said. “Everybody loves tailgates. They really foster a sense of community. I think tailgates are great.” 
Students can vote in the USG election beginning Feb. 5.

USC students, faculty and alumni joined protesters marching through downtown Los Angeles for the third annual Women’s March Saturday. They carried homemade signs that read “Jewish Women Are Powerful,” “#TheFutureIsBlue” and “Feminism Is Big Dick Energy,” among others. 
Speakers like women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who represents some victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, L.A. city councilmembers Nury Martinez and Monica Rodriguez and actress Laverne Cox celebrated the increased number of women in Congress while calling for equal pay and reproductive rights, among other issues.
Members of USC student organizations, including Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Environmental Student Assembly, USC College Democrats, Trojan Advocates for Political Progress and Residential Education at USC attended the march, which saw over 600,000 people fill the streets of downtown, according to a Facebook post from Mayor Eric Garcetti.
Amelia Montooth, a senior majoring in international relations global business, said she appreciated the diversity among the march’s participants. 
“I really love the display of unity and, hopefully, intersectionality that would include both Jewish and Muslim women who are oppressed in different ways,” Montooth said. “I think I am seeing that a lot in the women who are here, even if it is not really seen in the leadership.” 
The march’s leaders have received criticism in the past regarding issues of anti-Semitism. Tamika Mallory and two other original founders of the march were criticized for allegedly supporting Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who has made numerous anti-Semitic and racist remarks, according to reports by The New York Times. The Times also reported that a founding member was allegedly pushed out of the organization for anti-Semitic reasons. 
Some Jewish students at the march said they considered not going, but ultimately decided to voice their support for the movement. 
“This year I felt it was really important to come and support my Jewish women,” said Assaf Manor, a freshman majoring in theatre and political science. “Because the L.A. Women’s March made such an effort to distance itself from all of those problems and publicly denounce anti-Semitism, I felt like it was a good place to come and show my support.” 
Out of 34 Women’s March chapters around the United States, 23 have officially separated themselves from Women’s March Inc., the movement’s parent organization. Last month, Women’s March California issued a statement saying it “does not share leadership, structure or funding with Women’s March Inc.”
Emily Wulf, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, said that though some of the founders of the march were controversial, attending has more to do with showing solidarity with the women marching.
Wulf said the Women’s March was a perfect opportunity for USC students to demonstrate their interest in activism. She also said she believes the culture of activism and social justice on campus reflects a minimal effort.
“For me, I feel like [the] social justice presence on campus has always remained very surface level and pseudo-knowledgeable,” Wulf said. “You see a lot of people who try to remain politically active, but they do it in the bare minimum way.” 
Maria Camacho, a freshman majoring in international relations, said the Women’s March helped her find an outlet to strengthen her involvement with activism. 
“I think I’ve been desperately looking for some sense of solidarity, whether it be my identity as a woman, as a Latina woman or as a queer Latina woman,” Camacho said. “I’m just trying to find a community that I can stand behind and rally behind … just because I feel like there’s been a lack of that.”
Camacho said she has not been able to easily find a sense of solidarity among people who are social justice-oriented on campus and that “slacktivism,” or lazy activism, is apparent within the student body. At protests like that against conservative commentator Ben Shapiro’s appearance on campus in October, Camacho said a small number of students turn out and that they often lack a cohesive message. 
“The problem with USC is that you have to look very deeply to find the communities that you want,” Camacho said. “USC is not notoriously known for it’s very outspoken mannerisms, or dealing with these sorts of issues.” 
Montooth said though the majority of USC’s population does not actively participate in protests, she believes that open discussion takes place on an individual level.
“I see a lot of individual optimism, which is good and bad,” Montooth said. “I do think I see a lot of open discussions. And even though we’re in L.A., … I do see opinions from all over the spectrum on each side of everything.”
School of Dramatic Arts professor Mike Stutz, who attended the Women’s March with a group of activists painted blue called the “Blue Wave,” said he thinks it’s important for students to use their voices. 
“[Students] are the future of this country, to state the obvious,” Stutz said. “Get involved now and you understand what a difference you can make. I think the saddest thing out there is someone who thinks they have no effect on the world around them.”

Members of Young Americans for Freedom and other student groups voiced concerns over a proposed bylaw amendment that would allow the Undergraduate Student Government to pull funding from guest speaker events specifically on the basis of campus safety. YAF is the organization responsible for hosting conservative commentator Ben Shapiro on campus in October.
“The moment you cross from a legislative duty into one of moral authority — to me that’s a form of corruption,” said Josh Masters, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts. “I don’t want to see that happen at this school.” Masters, who spoke in opposition to the amendment, is not a YAF member.
The bylaw amendment proposes that guests who pose a threat to student safety may be subject to approval through a senate vote. Students will be given 10 business days to file a petition against funding for guest speakers through USG. 
A petition may be approved if it is proven that the speaker has encouraged violence from audiences or supported and received endorsements from hate groups. For the guest speaker to lose funding from USG, the petition must also receive at least a two-thirds vote from senators. 
“The common goal is to keep the dialogue but you want to feel OK having these controversial speakers on campus,” senate aide Adenike Makinde said. “We’re not here to put something up and have no one say anything about it.” 
Makinde, a freshman majoring in real estate development, suggested the idea of the amendment to Sen. Meagan Lane after Shapiro’s visit to USC. According to current bylaws, all guest speakers brought on campus qualify for USG funding.
The conservative commentator’s appearance sparked controversy throughout campus. Cultural groups including the Black, Latinx and Asian Pacific American student assemblies objected to USG funding of the event. Students protested on Trousdale Parkway throughout the day of the visit while the line for the event stretched from Bovard Auditorium to Jefferson Boulevard.
“We want to make sure students are put into situations where they’re allowed to have those conversations but [are] not afraid of their safety,” Makinde said. 
Despite students’ objections during the meeting, the bylaw amendment was not discussed by senators since it was not budgeted for the meeting’s agenda. Makinde said Lane, who officially proposed the bylaw amendment, and YAF chairman Maxwell Brandon may meet later to discuss conflicts over the proposed legislation.

The Trojan Advocates for Political Progress are fighting for gun control legislation with the help of snail mail. Partnering with shoemaker TOMS, student volunteers gathered near Alumni Park Tuesday and urged passersby to sign postcards to send to Congress. 
TAPP is supporting a measure introduced to Congress earlier this month that would require background checks on all gun sales and most gun transfers, according to President Alec Vanderberg, a junior majoring in public policy.
TOMS, which announced its campaign in December, has collected over 700,000 signed postcards to show support for the bill, H.R. 8. According to Vandenberg, TOMS reached out to TAPP and other university organizations to reach more supporters and achieve their goal of sending one million postcards to Congress. 
TOMS giving coordinator Mo Dugan said that pushing for background checks is the first step in solving gun violence issues. 
“[TOMS] has a history of philanthropy in trying to better the world through business,” Dugan said. “We know that gun violence is an issue that touches a lot of communities … We are starting with universal background checks, because it is something that is supported by a large majority of Americans.” 
Dugan said TOMS also wanted to gather support from younger demographics who could have a significant impact on public policy. 
“Young people are so important in politics in general and especially right now,” Dugan said. “We want to be addressing something that matters to them and also including them in the conversation. [We don’t want to make] it talking at young people, but really engaging them in the conversation and hearing what young people care about and how this issue affects them personally.” 
TAPP volunteer Anisha Anisetti said she thinks universal background checks are essential to protect against gun violence. Anisetti said she joined TAPP because the organization provides hands-on volunteering experiences to students who want to be engaged in politics and create change. 
“I think a really great thing about TAPP is that it is super direct involvement,” said Anisetti, a freshman majoring in economics. “It’s not like we donate for other people to go out and do the work; we do the work ourselves, which is really cool.”
Vandenberg said TAPP hopes to help make universal background checks a legal requirement.
“We know that over 50 Americans die due to some form of gun violence every single day, and any policy that lowers that at any degree will make a great difference that we definitely want to be a part of,” Vandenberg said. “Especially [since] H.R. 8 was just introduced in Congress, we really wanted to make sure there is enough of a solid backing of grassroots effort to get this bill across the finish line.”

After an emphatic victory against UCLA Saturday, the men’s basketball team is looking to stay the course with a pair of home games this weekend. 
The Trojans will first face off against Arizona Thursday before taking on Arizona State Saturday night. The two games will give the team a chance to face off against the No. 2 and No. 3 teams in the Pac-12 after a two-game skid of losses on the road in Oregon.
The Wildcats are 5-1 in conference play with a lone 59-54 loss to Oregon last Thursday. The team’s high-powered offense has scored 75 or more points in their past three games, under the leadership of sophomore guard Brandon Randolph, who averages 15.4 points per game. Although the team is young — with three underclassmen as its leading scorers — the Wildcats have been building toward dominant wins, capped off by an 11-point victory over the Oregon State Beavers days after the Trojans fell to them.
After facing off against Arizona, the team will only have a few days to regroup before facing the Sun Devils. Ranked third in the conference, Arizona State is fresh off a pair of wins in Oregon. Standout freshman Luguentz Dort, a Canadian guard averaging 16.4 points per game, has led the team this season.
Both teams will provide a challenge for the Trojans, who are settled in the middle of the Pac-12 standings with a pair of conference losses. The team has been in its element at the Galen Center this season, going 9-2 at home and that continued strength will be vital to carving out a place in an evenly balanced conference.
Despite the Bruins’ rocky 10-8 start — which culminated in an early-season firing of sixth-year head coach Steve Alford — the Trojans’ dominant win over their rivals bolstered the team’s confidence on Saturday. At first, the rivalry game remained neck-and-neck, with the Trojans exiting the first half with only a 3-point lead. But the second half was a different story, and the Trojans powered on to an 80-67 victory. 
Senior forward Bennie Boatwright and junior forward Nick Rakocevic led the flurry of scoring with 21 points apiece, tallying both players’ second double-digit game in a row. Junior guard Jonah Mathews added 16 points, providing a well-balanced attack that sustained the Trojans throughout the game.
The team isn’t fully operational yet, with freshman Kevin Porter Jr. remaining on the sidelines due to an indefinite suspension. The cause and terms of his suspension have yet to be disclosed by USC Athletics, but Enfield said after practice on Tuesday that the freshman is “trying” to meet expectations to return to game action soon. Before his suspension, Porter Jr. averaged 10.7 points per game for the Trojans.

After a full week at the Australian Open in Melbourne, the USC men’s and women’s tennis teams took care of business in exhibition matches against players from the Tennis Australia National Team and in their first regular season matches against the University of South Carolina Gamecocks. 
Both teams faced off against the Tennis Australia National Team on Jan. 20. The men went undefeated in doubles play, while only one singles player endured a loss. Two USC doubles teams consisting of freshman Mor Bulis and junior Riley Smith, and freshman Bradley Frye and redshirt junior Jake DeVine, faced off against the Australian National Team. Bulis and Smith won against an Australian doubles team 6-4. 
As for singles, the Men of Troy only lost one match, as Harry Bourchier beat Bulis in a game that went right down to the wire. The rest of the singles players consisted of Smith, Frye and DeVine, who all won their matches with ease.
The Women of Troy won both doubles matches against Australia and three out of four singles matches. The doubles teams consisted of sophomore Alexa Corcoleotes and junior Sydney Van Alphen, and junior Becca Weissmann and freshman Danielle Willson. Weissman and Willson had the closest match for the women’s team, narrowly winning against Australia 7-6. 
Singles had their fair share of wins as well, as sophomore Ana Neffa, Weissmann and Wilson all won their matches in two sets. The only loss for the Women of Troy was from Van Alphen’s two-set defeat to Australia’s Katherine Westbury.
After a dominating day for both teams, the Trojans quickly recuperated for their first regular season match the following day.
On the men’s side, the No. 5 Trojans took care of business against No. 25 South Carolina. Winning by a score of 4-0, the Men of Troy went undefeated in both singles and doubles matches.
For doubles, the No. 1 seed team of junior Brandon Holt and Smith defeated South Carolina pair senior Yancy Dennis and freshman Raphael Lambling by a score of 6-1. In addition, sophomore Daniel Cukierman and Frye won their match to win the doubles point for the Trojans.
The single players had to put up a fight, but Cukierman, senior Laurens Verboven and freshman Jake Sands all won their singles matches to give the Trojans a sweep against the Gamecocks.  
The women’s team started off NCAA play strong as well, beating the No. 13 South Carolina Gamecocks in a memorable comeback. The Women of Troy ended up beating the Gamecocks 4-1, but it would not have been possible without the gutsy fight from Neffa, senior Rianna Valdes and junior Angela Kulikov. All three players powered their way through tough first set losses to beat their opponents in three sets.
Kulikov had one of her best matches as a Trojan, coming back from a 0-6 first set in her match against junior Mia Horvit. Both Neffa and Valdes easily finished off their matches against senior Rachel Rohrabacher and sophomore Megan Davies respectively.
In doubles, Kulikov and Valdes won their match against junior Silivia Chinellato and Davies in an easy two sets. Weissmann and Willson and freshman Salma Ewing and Neffa both lost their matches, which prevented the Women of Troy from beating the Gamecocks 5-0.
The men’s tennis team plays against South Alabama and UC Santa Barbara at Marks Stadium this Saturday. Women’s tennis’ next match is at Marks Stadium against Loyola Marymount University on Jan. 31.

When men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield was asked before the season about senior forward Bennie Boatwright’s NBA prospects, he was adamant in his response: “We don’t even discuss the NBA.”
Coming off a knee injury that kept Boatwright off the court for eight months, the captain needed to get his rhythm and timing back, according to Enfield. Talking about the NBA at that juncture, he said, was pointless.
It might be time to start that conversation. Eighteen games into the season, Boatwright leads the Trojans in scoring at 17.3 points per game, shooting a career-high 39 percent from the 3-point range. After Boatwright dropped 21 points and five 3s in an emphatic 80-67 win over UCLA on Saturday at the Galen Center, the message was clear: “Bennie Buckets” is back.
“I feel totally more comfortable now,” Boatwright said. “It took me a couple of games to get comfortable out there. I’m feeling a lot better.”
When asked about what the blowout rivalry win means for the team moving forward, Enfield did not hesitate to put the spotlight on Boatwright.
“Our team has improved, and [a] big part of that is Bennie Boatwright,” Enfield said.
The coach touted Boatwright’s rhythm, his feel, his rebounding and his defense, all of which flowed into his offensive game. It is all back, a far cry from when Boatwright struggled early in the season against top-25 opponents in Nevada, TCU and Oklahoma.
“Bennie hadn’t played in eight months and you’ve seen, since mid-December, he’s a totally different player,” Enfield said.
That was apparent on Saturday. Boatwright stepped into jumpers with confidence, was assertive offensively and active on the glass with seven rebounds. He made shots that he missed earlier in the year. He made moves that he didn’t attempt in November.
“I don’t think people understand how tough it is to come back from an injury,” Boatwright said. “When you don’t play basketball for a long time, it’s tough to get a rhythm. You’re not to go out there and score 20, 30 [points]. You’ve got to work your way up. It’s a tough process.”
Junior guard Jonah Mathews, a fellow captain who played against Boatwright in high school, sees the difference in Boatwright’s game. The two talk about basketball daily, and he has seen Boatwright develop this season.
“You can tell the maturity of the way he thinks about basketball and the way he sees things on the court is next-level,” Mathews said. “He’s changed tremendously. He’s changed his game, mentally, physically, so it’s great to see.”
Boatwright is averaging 21.3 points over his last seven games on 52 percent shooting, and his five 3s on Saturday were the most he has made in a game this season. Slowly, but surely, he is developing into the stretch-four prototype that NBA scouts drool over.
Mathews is not surprised. Having been familiar with Boatwright’s game since high school, Mathews always knew he was talented.
“But when you have a knee injury like that, it can mess with you mentally,” Mathews said. “He got through it … Now, he’s back to ‘Bennie Buckets.’”

On a dreary, rainy night in Los Angeles last week, the Lakers found themselves in must-win mode. With LeBron James sidelined, they had dropped seven of their last 10 games. A loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls would have been an utter embarrassment for the so-called “Baby Lakers” and head coach Luke Walton. A loss would have heated Walton’s seat from warm to downright sweltering, as doubts arise surrounding his offense and ability to develop the team’s young stars.  
The Lakers didn’t lose that Tuesday night, but they didn’t do much to discredit all the noise. With a retooled, defensive-minded lineup, the team coughed up 17 turnovers and shot a mediocre 8-for-26 from the 3-point range. Point guard Lonzo Ball shouldered a lion’s share of the offensive load, as Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram clinched a collective 1-for-8 from deep. Ball scored 19, while Kuzma and Ingram underwhelmed with 16 apiece. 
Even when the Lakers led by 18 points with less than five minutes remaining, it was something of a mirage. The Bulls would storm back to within 5 points over the next few minutes, forcing an unusually tepid Staples Center crowd to sweat a little bit. The Lakers held off the run and won 107-100, but they impressed no one. 
Since that Bulls game, the Lakers have continued their trend of lackluster play without James. When James went down with a groin injury on Christmas Day, the Lakers were in the thick of the playoff hunt, tied for the fourth seed in the Western Conference. Now they’re on the outside looking in, sitting at ninth place as of Jan. 21. They’ve gone 5-8 without James, defeating only one team currently positioned to make the playoffs during that span. They needed overtime to defeat the third-seed Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night. 
The past month has crystallized Laker fans’ worst fears. Outside of the addition of James, the team hasn’t improved significantly from last season’s 26-win stinker. 
And , of course, the Lakers’ core is still very young compared to the rest of the league. Despite adding veterans like James, Rajon Rondo and Javale McGee this off-season, the Lakers had the fifth-youngest roster at season’s start, with an average age of 25.4. But the issue isn’t that the Lakers are too inexperienced. Topping the list of youngest rosters was the Denver Nuggets, who currently have the third-most wins in the NBA. The Lakers’ real issue lies in how little its younger players have improved. 
Take Ingram, for example: Many analysts pegged him as a generational scorer when he entered the 2016 NBA Draft at 18 years old. At a spry age of 21, he still has plenty of time to make that leap, but he’s regressed in multiple areas this season. As a 3-point shooter, Ingram’s percentage has fallen from 39 percent in 2017-18 to 29.7 percent this year, in line with his rookie season clip of 29.4. His player efficiency rating, which measures per-minute effectiveness, dipped from 13.8 to 11.7 in 2018 — with 15.0 as the league average. 
Ingram’s statistical slump should partially be blamed on the Lakers’ offensive schemes. Though his 3-point numbers are down, Ingram remains proficient from the corner, where he shoots at a 40 percent clip. Yet, only 23 percent of his 3-point attempts have come from the corner, the lowest share since he entered the league.
In his sophomore season, Ball also failed to show significant signs of improvement. His points per game (10.2 to 9.9) and assists per game (7.2 to 5.4) numbers are both down from his rookie year. With James out, Ball averaged a solid 7.2 assists and 12.5 points per game, but his month came to an unsatisfying end when he suffered an ankle sprain against the Rockets. He’s expected to miss three to six weeks, adding to the Lakers’ injury toll. 
Ironically enough, the young Laker with the least hype upon entering the league has shown the most flashes of potential stardom. Former 27th overall pick Kyle Kuzma is scoring 22.3 points per game in January, with his highest 3-point percentage — 34 percent — of any month this season. However, with James, Ball and Rondo sidelined, Kuzma remains too unseasoned to run the Lakeshow by himself. 
Walton can’t be entirely blamed for the team’s January backslide. The team’s been hit hard by the injury bug, and this season’s Cavaliers show how far a team can fall once it loses James. Still, the team’s sputtering offense and lack of development land squarely on Walton’s shoulders. The longer James is out, the longer those flaws will be exposed.

Workshop Salon and Boutique will open its doors at USC Village on Thursday. Last week, the Daily Trojan met with owner Monique Reynolds to discuss the shop’s opening, as well as what it means to be a small business owner.
Daily Trojan: When is Workshop Salon and Boutique open for business? Can we expect to see doors open soon, and will the fire last Tuesday affect the grand opening at all? 
Monique Reynolds: The fire wasn’t that bad. It didn’t do damage … [The salon] just needed some new paint. Next Thursday, we’ll open the doors.  
DT: Your mission statement says that Workshop’s goal is to “make every guest that walks through our door and sits in our chair feel their most beautiful.” Could you tell us more about what makes your business special?
MR: It’s every girl’s dream to shop and get her hair done, right? It’s nice to have that extra touch of fashion and jewelry, or to grab a quick gift while you’re processing everything else. We’re always trying to multi-task and get things done, and beauty and fashion coincide … People come and end up hanging out longer than they normally would … Our plan is to have happy hour on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, with blow-outs and styling. Girls can come down from the dorms and make appointments together. 
DT: How did you get into the beauty industry? Did you always envision yourself running two businesses?
MR: I didn’t know what I wanted to do out of high school. I went to Cal Poly Pomona and started out studying accounting, but when I was in my third year, I hated it. I switched to business law, and after that, I knew I didn’t want to be in an office, so I went to a junior college in Yorba Linda to do physical therapy. I went to Europe and decided I wanted to be an aesthetician. I went to Paul Mitchell Skin Academy in Costa Mesa and mostly did waxing and started tattooing eyebrows. I did that for 12 years, met a ton of amazing people, hair stylists, artists … and I did weddings. I exhausted all possible opportunities in the beauty industry.
One of my best friends was a hair stylist looking for a community with a very good vibe that wasn’t competitive and [was] very supportive. At the time, I had a very small skin salon. I said, “I have room for you,” and I put in a hair chair. Eventually, my salon grew into five hair chairs, a treatment room and a brow chair, as well as a shop on the side. But I had to focus. I focused more on my clothing store and the salon, combining the two. Then, USC approached me about opening a space at USC Village. This was my next step.  I’m going to go big. 
DT: At the Costa Mesa location, the salon offers Reiki massage therapy, sugar hair removal services, formal makeup and other options, which all draw in different groups of people. What specific ideas do you have for the USC location?
MR: I will always offer our special occasion makeup. One of my ideas for the USC location is to have a team that goes to the sorority houses and takes care of everyone for formals. My ideas are directed to the students. USC Village has totally exceeded [USC’s projections], and I don’t ever want to turn someone away. I also like to have stylists that are well-rounded in everything.
DT: What would you say to bring in people who do not normally visit salons or specialty services? How are you planning on bringing these individuals inside Workshop’s doors?
MR: The vibe of the space is going to be full of energy, but also calming, and it will attract people to come in.  Some salons have this feeling of intimidation — the thought, “Am I cool enough to be in here?”  People think that it will be too expensive. That doesn’t happen at Workshop. Workshop is for everyone. The guys will have a little barber area. At Workshop we are very welcoming. We make eye contact and everyone who walks through that door is going to feel welcomed … and excited about learning, through styling lessons. Self care is very important.

There are only three certainties in life: dying, paying taxes and wondering if something is wrong with your body. 
Fear not, because Mara Altman is here to reassure you that everything is perfectly normal — especially those parts you don’t want to talk about. Her book “Gross Anatomy” delves into the taboo, those unmentionable bits where, if an issue crops up, you only worry about it privately, or maybe confide it to a friend, or occasionally disclose it to a health professional. Dividing the book into “The Top Half” and “The Bottom Half,” Altman embarks on a head-to-toe tour of the human anatomy, confronting topics like chin hair, head lice, warts, belly buttons, camel toe, PMS and hemorrhoids. 
In addition to describing her own experiences with such subjects, Altman also conducts interviews with experts including doctors, scientists, an Allure editor, a salon owner and a host of sociology, anthropology and gender studies professors. Though often bemused by her line of questioning, they do their best to shed some light on the matter.
Some of these problems aren’t exclusive to women, of course. But it’s undeniable that for women, copping to struggles with “gross” bodily functions is a big no-no. Such admittance would puncture the illusion of the fairer sex as mystical beings who effortlessly comply with societal beauty standards, never spending hours soaping, shaving and squeezing their bodies into submission. Why would women get hemorrhoids? They don’t even poop. 
“Gross Anatomy” serves multiple purposes; it is Altman’s own reckoning with her physical imperfections while also a demystification of the female body that considers the array of factors conspiring to keep women insecure and ashamed of their natural selves. The book would be, I’m sure, a great source of relief and comfort for many women who are finally witnessing their truth brought to light. But for me, it served a slightly more insidious purpose: feeling vaguely superior to Altman and the women who relate to her. 
It was hard for me to relate to Altman. I have minimal body hair: I don’t even grow underarm hair and my leg hair is light and wispy and barely discernible. I don’t experience PMS symptoms: often my period arrives without me noticing. The last time I sweated was while running the mile in ninth grade P.E. and I’ve never worn deodorant or antiperspirant. 
OK, am I bragging here? You bet your ass I am. But can you blame me, when I’ve been told my whole life that performative femininity is the key to ascension and acceptance? For someone whose most ardent desire is to strip away her corporeal form like the peel off a banana, I sure do spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. 
There’s also the fact that I’m only 20, with the taut body and youthful arrogance to prove it. But I have enough foresight (and enough living evidence surrounding me) to know that such assets do not last forever. The day will come when my body will resemble those that Altman encounters at the nudist resort she visits with her mother — thighs dimpled with cellulite, skin dripping from upper arms, stray patches of hair sprouting up in places I didn’t even know contained follicles. 
There’s no guarantee that I won’t develop PMS in the future, or, God forbid, hemorrhoids. My feckless treatment of my sphincters may just come back to bite me in the ass (literally). 
Altman’s perverse humor combined with her scientific inquiries make “Gross Anatomy” a fun, enjoyable read, one that may resonate at different frequencies for women of different ages. One book probably isn’t enough to undo years of social conditioning, but it’s a step toward destigmatizing these fleshly prisons, no matter what they look like or what weird things they do.

Just when the volume of streaming services seemed to have hit its peak, YouTube made the jump to original programming. The long-standing platform, traditionally utilized for short-form comedy, self reflection blogs and how-to videos began broadening its scope with original content in 2016. YouTube’s foray into original programming continues with action-packed comedy series “Wayne,” which was released Wednesday.
“Wayne” stars Mark McKenna as the brooding titular character, a young and reckless 15-year-old who embodies a new kind of vigilante. Written by series creator Shawn Simmons, the pilot episode largely revolves around giving context to Wayne’s environment. Viewers meet his father, who is dying from cancer; his principal, a trusted yet confrontational mentor; and Del, his main love interest. Each character, though, is merely a tool used to tell Wayne’s main story, which is ultimately framed around a road trip to recover his father’s classic 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am. 
The biggest issue with the series’ is its largely unoriginal storytelling. Simmons fails to build a world that audiences haven’t seen before. In the vast sea of streaming content, new shows need to find ideas that carry unique storylines. While this is notably difficult given the sheer amount of content pumped into platforms, the premiere is nevertheless filled with cliches, badly acted characters and a lackluster origin story. 
The premiere’s setting makes it clear that “Wayne” won’t be YouTube’s springboard into prestige television. Brockton, Massachusetts is a low income neighborhood — an environment reminiscent of “Shameless,” a similarly coarse comedy that far better utilizes vulgarity as a tool rather than a crutch (at least in its earlier seasons). 
Additionally, the characters are largely archetypal, generic versions  of personalities seen in other, stronger shows — Wayne’s aforementioned principal is nothing more than the angry teacher trope who resorts to juvenile behavior to keep the school in order; Wayne’s well-meaning yet wholly irrelevant father and sidekick best friend fail to display any compelling qualities or complexity in character. Orlando, the best friend, is only interested in Wayne’s nude magazines, while Wayne’s father simply wants to live to see another day with Wayne. The most banal character of the show, however, is Wayne’s love interest Del.
Played poorly by Ciara Bravo, Del is a knock-off version of Fiona from “Shameless” — both use vulgarity and brashness as a distraction from their tough familial life. The issue, though, is that Del’s character is so superficial that she fails to evoke empathy among viewers. Her relationship with Wayne feels like a failed rehash of the love story in Netflix’s compulsively watchable “The End of the F**king World”. 
While “Wayne” is largely a collection of recycled material, Simmons attempts to introduce a new kind of vigilante by having Wayne use violence to right the wrongs of his closest confidants. The problem is that the story layered over the subtext does not offer enough nuance and detail for audiences to remain interested. 
Of course, there is opportunity for “Wayne” to improve beyond its pilot, but given the way streaming series are structured as season-long arcs, it does not seem that “Wayne” will ultimately survive as a successful series in today’s precarious television landscape.

My roommate is a lovely person. He grew up in Pittsburgh, was raised Catholic, is one of four brothers and describes himself as “40 percent Irish, 60 percent German.” But when I asked him what his favorite Asian food was, he replied, “General Tso’s Chicken.” 
I’m not going to lie — General Tso’s Chicken is pretty damn good — and I find the pretentiousness surrounding the authenticity of Americanized Asian food to be extremely annoying. 
When I’m eating a $14 Dynamite Roll from Wokcano, I don’t particularly care if “real Japanese sushi doesn’t use cream cheese;” I go to Wokcano for sake bombs, not authentic sushi. Regardless, having General Tso’s Chicken be your favorite Asian food was a little questionable to me. Does he even know how much great Asian food there is out there?
Turns out, he didn’t. His knowledge of Asian food entirely rested between two freezers in the Target frozen foods section. He had never tried, and sometimes hadn’t even heard of, all my favorite foods. While this initially shocked me, after thinking about it for a while, I realized that this was actually a pretty common theme among my white friends. 
Forget about pig intestines and cow tongue — these were people who had sometimes never even tried pho, to which “BCD” meant nothing more than three consecutive letters of the alphabet. The number of times I’ve had to grit my teeth and choose Denny’s over BCD Tofu House has been soul-crushing, particularly because I hung out with a predominantly white friend group in high school. The people who thought cracking a raw egg into boiling soup was “unsanitary” were also the ones consuming raw cookie dough by the bowl and eating off the same plates as their pets. Yes, I am bitter.
I have a deep love for Asian food. I would gladly spend the rest of my life eating exclusively Asian food if I could. Yet, like every other Asian American in the country, I grew up wanting to hate it. In an attempt to gain recognition from my white classmates and friends, I denounced the Mapo tofu and Singaporean rice noodles that often made their way into my lunchbox. In their wake, I boldly proclaimed my love for Smucker’s Uncrustables and Olive Garden. 
This universal experience of being ashamed of the “exotic” food in our lunchboxes has already been the subject of many illuminating thinkpieces, each reflecting the shared ideas of not fitting in, of those scrunched up noses and judgmental gazes. As I continue into adulthood, I see this patronization of Asian food taking a different form. Thankfully, it’s generally considered rude among adults to be openly condescending toward ethnic cuisines. 
Now, the condescending attitude toward Asian cuisines must be expressed in much more subtle terms. It materializes through wanting to spend $40 on a plate of pasta, but having Chinese food that costs more than $10 be “too expensive.” It creeps into our lives via long-winded tirades on how amazing it would be to eat Michelin-star quality French cuisine in Paris, but how the main appeal of eating in Thailand is just how cheap everything is! 
It appears in unsolicited advice on the benefits of going vegan with no thought whatsoever about how entire cuisines essential to Asian culture rely on meat and dairy for cooking. It says, “I’m not saying Asian food is inferior … I’m saying that European food is superior.”
Yet, moving forward, I don’t think that the best way to go about this is righteous bitterness. Sharing food is one of the most joyful methods of cultural exchange. Since finding out he’s had essentially no Asian food, I’ve taken my roommate to get pho, Chinese hot pot, Japanese curry and more. He approaches food with an open-mindedness I consider almost remarkable for a white person; he’s even been willing to try some of the more uncommon foods, which he eventually grew to love.
Though not everyone I know will be like him, I will still unhesitatingly extend my invitation. It’s not my job to introduce people to new foods. In fact, some people might even say doing so is problematic, a symbolic gesture of submissiveness to the people who made me hate the food of my own culture. 
There’s some validity in that anger, but in the end, it’s just so much fun to introduce people to new foods they’ve never eaten. If I can convince even one person to open their mind to new cuisines they’d never considered before, it’d be worth another 99 trips to Denny’s (but don’t quote me on that).

Last week, USC hosted its third annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week, featuring a series of lectures and discussions about marginalized groups and inclusion on campus. Topics included working with disabilities, encouraging LGBTQ+ rights and identifying as black or Latinx in academic spaces. But while there were many of these workshops to choose from, the programming lacked discussion centered on multiracial spaces in academia.
The Pew Research Center reported in 2013 that Americans younger than 18 made up only 23 percent of the total population. Yet, they made up 46 percent of those identifying as multiracial. While the total number of multiracial Americans account for just 3 percent of the total population, the increase in young people classified as such signals that those working to improve inclusion efforts on college campuses should think more about how to serve these students moving forward.
Questions of where multiracial students fit in at a university begin even before they step onto campus. The Common Application, used by USC and other schools, asks applicants to identify which racial group they belong to. With diversity as a major talking point for elite schools, prospective students of mixed race may feel pressured to check the box for whichever part of their racial identity they feel will help make their case for admission. A biracial student may only declare their minority identity throughout the application process with the hope of a better chance at admission through affirmative action.
Even something as simple as ignoring one or more parts of a student’s identity to bolster their chances with admission sets a harmful precedent. If unaddressed, this oversight would tell these individuals that only part of who they are is valuable in college spaces. This would make them uncomfortable with questions about their race later on or force them to continue overlooking their full racial identity in  attempt to fit in or “pass.” 
On campus, there is a variety of clubs for students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds to give them a sense of community. Groups like El Centro Chicano and the Black Student Assembly provide students with resources to engage with their racial identity in academic contexts and find people with similar experiences to help them adjust to college. Most of these groups are open to those beyond their target demographic, but ultimately, they serve students from a specific racial and ethnic background.
Students of mixed race descent can look for community through these organizations, but their experiences are different than those of someone identifying as only one race. This can lead to “imposter syndrome” and students feeling they “didn’t count” enough to belong with that group because of their mixed background. Students who are white-passing, who don’t look like they belong to a minority group, may feel their appearance disqualifies them from belonging to one of these groups. Those who look more like one race over another may feel pressured to choose organizations that prioritize that particular identity. 
MixedSC is a student organization that addresses this. According to its Facebook page, MixedSC is a  “welcoming social community created to connect multiracial students at USC.” Organizations like this, which aim to give students a place to explore what it means to be mixed, can provide a sense of belonging on campus. Having a space where students can engage with their full racial identity is beneficial in helping them understand where their experiences fit in.
However, resources for mixed students should not stop at a single student organization. USC needs to reach out to multiracial students and let them know they are as valued as anyone else on campus. Lectures and discussions on what it means to be multiracial should be held alongside those for students in a single minority group. Creating welcome events for mixed students to meet others similar to them during orientation can help them find a place of belonging early on, so they won’t feel pressured throughout their time at USC to pick an identity. 
USC Admission should take a firm stance that identifying as more than one race on an application is just as important in creating a diverse student body as having more students from a single minority group, so it is not ingrained in them before arriving that they have to mask part of their identity.
