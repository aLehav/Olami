The Women of Troy continued their red-hot start to the season after defeating Long Beach State  3-0 on Senior Day on Friday.
The Trojans looked comfortable at the start of the game, controlling the ball in the midfield. Long Beach State started the game with three midfielders against the Trojans’ four, which proved to be too much for the 49ers. Long Beach State could not create any opportunities as they lacked any kind of meaningful possession. 
On the other end of the field, sophomore midfielder Alea Hyatt scored her first goal of the season. She got the ball on the right side of Long Beach State’s box and had a shot deflected, but she quickly recovered the ball again and beat the keeper to get the Trojans on the board.
The second half saw senior forward Leah Pruitt score twice. The first came from a great overall team play. Freshman forward Penelope Hocking split two defenders with a pass to Pruitt who calmly put it away. Hocking’s pass was the kind of movement head coach Keidane McAlpine has been looking for this season, as it is the best way to break open a defense and create great opportunities to score goals from good positions.
“I think [Hocking] is really great off the bench because she comes in, and she’s like a little fireplug up top and I love playing with her, and I think we play really well together and I’m excited when she comes in on the field,” Pruitt said after the game.
Pruitt appeared upset before scoring her second goal of the game after being fouled constantly by Long Beach State senior defender Alyssa Alvarez and both players appeared to be angry with each other. However, her frustration did not get in the way of her scoring. Her next goal came from a cross from freshman fullback Ashley Soto, who delivered the ball into the box from the right side and perfectly found Pruitt’s head to put the game to bed in the 89th minute of the game.
“She was really feisty, but I kind of like when they get feisty because I can get feisty back,” Pruitt said after the game. “It felt really good to help my team with those goals. I think that [the second goal] was like a team goal because we worked all the way from the backline, getting it up and getting the cross so it was good.”
Overall, the Trojans performed much better in this game. They moved the ball much better and created more dangerous opportunities from good positions than they did against Missouri and San Diego last weekend.
“I thought the energy that we played with was much better than last weekend,” McAlpine said. “We started the game with a much better rhythm, we were able to maintain it for a much longer period of time. I think the pressure turned into not giving up corners and not giving up shots. That’s what we want to be about. We created a lot of chances, but probably still should be better in the final third. All in all, I think it was a good performance on a really special day.”
As the Trojans continue their winning streak, there seems to be more optimism about their prospect of winning another national championship. Senior defender Ally Prisock was a vital part of the team that won in 2016 but she said the two teams are different.
“We had different types of players on our team,” Prisock said. “I’d say in 2016 we were more athletic a little bit. We had an older team in 2016. Now we’re younger. But definitely we are still competitive and we still have the same drive, and I think we can get back to where we were.”
The one setback this weekend that junior fullback Ashleigh Plumptre’s absence due to an injury, so sophomore midfielder Tara McKeown had to play fullback. However, McKeown played that position all of last year for USC and for the U-20 USA National Team, so she did a good job of filling in that role. Plumptre’s injury is not believed to be too serious.
USC takes on its first Pac-12 rival of the season Saturday when it faces Washington at home at noon.

Saturday’s undressing at the hands of Texas marked yet another early-season setback for the Trojans. It was a game where the playcalling was once again suspect, where all three phases once again dropped the ball and where true freshman quarterback JT Daniels once again went through growing pains. 
There can be excuses, and there were. There can be injuries, and there were. There can be bad calls —  like the missed safety before halftime — that led to the game spiraling out of control. But at this point, it’s impossible to sugarcoat losses like the fact that USC was one or two plays away from winning the game. The team wasn’t close to beating Stanford last week, and it was run out of Texas after a pitiful second half performance.
Senior linebacker Porter Gustin could have not been ejected for targeting. Sophomore kicker Chase McGrath could have made the field goal attempt in the third quarter instead of having it blocked and returned for a touchdown. It wouldn’t have mattered. The result was a blowout, a head-scratching 37-14 rout against an unranked opponent that makes you wonder what this team even works on in practice.
Field goals should not be blocked. Punts should not be shanked. Star players should be smart enough to not get kicked out of the game. It’s not that hard.
Therein lies the point: USC has far too talented of a roster to play like this. The Trojans are stacked with four-and-five star recruits, up and down the program. They’ve had national top-10 recruiting classes for the past five years, according to 247Sports. The issue, then, is not the skill on this team, but rather those responsible for turning the skill into wins.
It’s become apparent that what drove USC’s success the last two seasons — a Rose Bowl trophy in 2016 and a Pac-12 Championship in 2017 — was not head coach Clay Helton and his staff, but rather Sam Darnold and his magic wand. Darnold masked  many of USC’s problems. Last season, it didn’t matter that the offensive line was decimated, that the wide receiving corps was inexperienced, that the playcalling was questionable because having a good quarterback atones for most problems that arise.
Helton does not have that luxury this year, and there is enough evidence by now to question how much he rode Darnold’s coattails to a contract extension over the offseason that runs through 2023. Consider this: Since taking over permanently in 2015, Helton has a 20-4 record in games started by Darnold. In eight games without Darnold as the starter, USC is 2-6 overall and winless against Power Five opponents, averaging 12.7 points per game in those losses. Twice, they’ve lost to Stanford. They lost to Wisconsin in the Holiday Bowl, to Alabama in a rotten 2016 season opener and to Texas on Saturday.
Bad losses to nonconference opponents is not the hallmark of a big-time program, and it reflects poorly on Helton, who has maintained decent job security thus far in his tenure. But at USC, a program with sky-high expectations no matter if the quarterback is a Heisman Trophy candidate or an 18-year-old freshman, things can go south quickly.
In 2016, when USC started off the season 1-3, Helton likely salvaged his job by benching Max Browne in favor of Darnold at quarterback. From that point on, Helton and Darnold were linked: Darnold’s success was Helton’s success, and there was a lot of it. But Darnold is gone now, replaced by a kid who can’t do this all by himself.
Daniels has received minimal help the last two weeks. He has attempted 117 passes, third among Pac-12 quarterbacks. But only one wide receiver — Amon-Ra St. Brown, Daniels’ high school teammate — has caught a touchdown pass. The run game is nonexistent and the playcalling continues to be questionable. And unlike Darnold, he can’t run, making the play calls somewhat predictable: either a straight handoff or a pass.
So it’s up to Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin to tailor the game plan to Daniels’ strengths, to give him time in the pocket to throw, to run the ball more. USC threw the ball 48 times against Texas as opposed to 16 carries, which incredulously  produced negative yardage on the night. Sophomore running back Stephen Carr ran for a 23-yard touchdown on the opening drive and then was not heard from again, actually losing 10 yards on his other five carries.
Few experts thought USC would contend for a playoff spot this season, and starting the season 1-2 with losses to Stanford and Texas on the road is not the end of the world in a weak Pac-12. But the way in which the Trojans lost both games, the way in which they were entirely outplayed by both teams and the way in which the coaching staff responded to a poor performance in Palo Alto with an even poorer performance against a mediocre Texas team is disheartening.
By now, we’ve seen enough to believe that Helton and his staff are still employed because of Darnold. It is imperative now for USC to rip off a win-streak as it begins play against a string of Pac-12 opponents starting Friday. It is imperative for Daniels, sooner rather than later, to beat a team other than UNLV. And it is imperative for the coaches to call plays to Daniels’ strengths and have the rest of this loaded roster play up to its potential so that the burden is not entirely on the shoulders of a true freshman.
This needs happen in order for this season to get back on track and for Helton to stay off the hot seat. Otherwise, this could be a long year, and Sam Darnold isn’t walking back through the door anytime soon.

Earlier this month, Marshall students James Yun, Brandon Kay, Claire Lin and Caitlyn Huang captured second place in the National University of Singapore International Case Competition. (Photo courtesy of Brandon Kay)
Last week, a team of Marshall students took second place at the National University of Singapore International Case Competition.  
The competition consisted of three rounds, in which the teams presented two different cases. A company told the teams about problems it was facing and the students brainstormed strategies to address the issues and present those to judges.
The student group comprised seniors Claire Lin and James Yun, junior Caitlyn Huang and sophomore Brandon Kay.
Following the first round of the competition, during which teams had to create a case presentation in five hours, the USC team took last place. 
“After we got last place, we were all pretty bummed out honestly,” said Huang, who was also named best female presenter. “So for the 24-hour one, we were just having a lot of fun, and I think we messed around a lot but it was more relaxed and we weren’t so stressed out.”
Before the second round, where teams had 24 hours to strategize and make a presentation, the team said faculty adviser and professor Clark Hansen gave them advice on how to improve their group performance.
Huang said they went into the 24-hour competition with a different mindset and were able to capture first place.
In the final round, the team took second place overall, beating business schools from the University of Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley.
“We were struggling,” Yun said. “We didn’t do too well. Professor Hansen gave us a pep talk. He kind of encouraged us, so we came back way more motivated and driven, and we just killed it on the second round.” 
The Marshall Case Team, composed of about 40 students, was chosen last semester to attend the competition. Each week they practiced by receiving a case on Monday and presenting their solutions to fellow team members at general meetings.
After joining the organization last semester, Kay said he has gained real world experience and looks forward to competing more in the future.
“A lot of the interviews for jobs will involve a case interview, so it’s great practice, especially coming in every week,” Kay said. “But also having a new purpose of competing and representing USC at another level — it’s unparalleled to other organizations on campus.” 
Huang added that the team has a good balance of different personalities, and each member focuses on certain roles like finance or strategy. Because of their team dynamics, they said that they hope to compete together again. 
“Overall, we’re very compatible,” Yun said. “We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and we build upon each other’s strengths.”

In a follow-up memo sent out on Friday that addressed USC and law enforcement’s investigation of allegations against a USC graduate student, Provost Michael Quick announced on Sunday that the student will not be on campus during the investigation. 
Quick acknowledged USC’s commitment to free speech, but he emphasized that the University does not tolerate threatening behavior or any act that would jeopardize campus safety. Quick wrote that even if the investigation concludes that the allegation is free and protected speech, it has had a negative impact. 
“Hate speech, by nature, is dehumanizing, degrading, toxic, and vile, and it leaves people feeling unsafe, unheard, afraid, and anxious,” Quick wrote. “I want to reassure you that we are constantly and rigorously managing, assessing, and mitigating threat.”
According to the memo, members of the USC community have shared their concerns with Quick not that the allegations affect the academic and business processes of the University and its emotional climate. 
Quick emphasized the University’s focus on student safety and security. He wrote that in the past year, USC’s Chief Threat Assessment Officer and threat assessment team have worked with the USC Department of Public Safety and consulted the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Los Angeles Police Department’s Threat Management Unit to develop new threat assessment resources and protocols. 
Quick encouraged anyone who witnesses incidents of hate speech or other issues of discrimination on USC campuses to report them.
Last Friday, Quick sent out a memo informing the USC community that the Department of Public Safety and USC’s chief threat assessment officer are working with local and federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of the community. 
Quick wrote that the University is still grappling to properly balance free speech and public safety, along with issues of diversity and inclusion. 
In the memo, he said USC and other American universities are working to distinguish hate speech from hate crime, and balancing the principles of free speech with campus safety. He added that USC is reaching out to leaders in the Academic Senate, Staff Assembly, Graduate Student Government and Undergraduate Student Government to address this.
He acknowledged the negative effects of hate speech on campus and encouraged the University community to turn to on-campus resources, including confidential counseling and pastoral resources. 
Quick wrote that, as provost, he has pushed the USC community to find solutions to issues of bias and discrimination to create a more inclusive environment for everyone. 
“Bias and discrimination are ‘wicked problems’ that negatively impact us as a diverse community of scholars, artists, and athletes,” Quick wrote. “But free speech also empowers us as a university to be an extraordinary incubator that translates our research into action and policy, so that we can proactively be part of a solution to the many crises we face today.”

“White Boy Rick,” the newest film from French Algerian director Yann Demange, is the latest “see-to-believe” true crime thriller. Despite having a fascinating premise, the film was meant to inaugurate the fall movie season with a bang, but falls desperately short. 
When he was 14, Rick Wershe Jr. (Richie Merritt), the youngest of two in a lower middle-class family in eastside Detroit, was hired by the FBI to buy and sell drugs undercover. He became the youngest informant ever but just four years later, when his services were no longer required, he began selling drugs for himself and quickly became America’s youngest cocaine kingpin. 
Wershe Jr.’s bizzare life calls for a film adaptation that takes the viewer deep into his mind; it is this possibility of being inside the mind of a 17-year-old drug lord that will get people to the theater as filmgoers have always been attracted to criminal psychology, especially in unbelievable cases like “Zodiac” (2007) or “Catch Me if You Can,” (2002) which also featured a minor becoming an affluent criminal. “White Boy Rick” does not deliver on this front. In its haste to move quickly through the many wild chapters of Rick’s life, the film sacrifices a deeper insight into the young outlaw’s mind.  
While its narrative is reminiscent of “Goodfellas” (1990) — another film about a kid growing up in the criminal underworld — it falls short when it never lets the audience partake in the adrenaline Rick may have felt at the height of his powers nor the the despair at his lowest. The blame falls mainly on poor pacing, an unclear style and subpar performances from most of the cast. 
The movie has a lot to juggle with in the many stages of its protagonist’s eclectic life. In its ambition to tackle so grand a subject, it ultimately never achieves balance between the various episodes of Rick’s experience. By moving too fast, it leaves barely any room to ruminate on what is going on: One moment Rick is working for the FBI and the next he is knee-deep in the drug world — a jarring, hardly explained rise to the top. This tight packaging of events suffocates the film and makes it hard to follow.
The story’s 1980s setting could have injected vitality into the film (just as it does in Netflix’s nostalgic “Stranger Things”), but every disco party scene, every money-making montage and every 80s oldie playing in the background is either misplaced or cut too short. In Rick’s first visit to “The Skate and Roll,” a roller-skating rink that doubles as the favorite rendezvous for the criminal youth, the audience is introduced to the vibrant scene along with Rick, but this sequence ends much too quickly for the following scenes to reap its energy.
The hope of clumsy films are its actors, but here, every performance is subordinate to Matthew McConaughey’s as Richard Wershe Sr. Without his unrelenting energy, the film would have capitulated entirely, but McConaughey transforms his twang and talent to a highly sentimental character, making him the most convincing part of the movie. The real Wershe Sr. juggled a junkie daughter, a decaying father and a drug dealing son; in his fatherly role, McConaughey can connect with his audience and transmit a genuine passion for keeping the family together. 
Alongside McConaughey is newcomer Merritt, a first-time actor who has mentioned in interviews that this is not only his first acting job, but it is his first job of any kind.
In some scenes more than others, it is painfully clear how inexperienced Merritt is. For much of the film, he fails to nuance his character with his limited arsenal of facial expressions and vocal intonations. Although painfully stale for most of his performance, Merritt flourishes in a couple of scenes such as one where he yells at his father in complete despair at their poverty; these are rumblings of true potential that may take a little more time and experience to fully unlock.

“Queer Eye” stars Jonathan Van Ness and Karamo Brown discussed LGBTQ representation and their personal and professional lives. (Caroline Cai | Daily Trojan)
Stars of Netflix’s Emmy award-winning reality anthology “Queer Eye” Jonathan Van Ness and Karamo Brown joined moderator JP Karliak for a conversation on gay identity and culture and their careers in entertainment at Bovard Auditorium on Saturday evening. 
Sponsors of the event included the USC Speakers Committee, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Queer & Ally Student Assembly among other culture and LGBTQ organizations. 
Van Ness and Brown — who are the grooming and culture experts on the show, respectively — were met with an enthusiastic welcome from a packed auditorium of USC students, many of whom jumped out of their seats as the stars took the stage. 
Karliak, a voiceover actor and alumnus of the USC School of Dramatic Arts, opened the conversation with praise for “Queer Eye” and asked Van Ness and Brown about the strides the show has made in queer representation. Brown thanked fans for contributing to the show’s success and reminded audience members of their power as consumers to demand improvements to on-screen diversity. 
“When you go to a film and you don’t see people of different races, gender expressions, sexual orientations, or religions, that means you’re telling these executives that this is okay with us — and it’s not,” Brown said. “So understand [that] the power is literally in your pocket.” 
Karliak breached the subject of how to balance reaching out to people who disagree with their political viewpoints while retaining respect for them. Van Ness said he could attest to such tense situations in his interactions with all sorts of clients as a hairstylist. Brown, who was previously a social worker and practicing psychotherapist, shared his insights and experiences. 
“First, try to be an empathetic listener and then use that to guide the conversation in a way that can help us all grow,” Brown said. 
Van Ness offered advice for how to deal with people who are not accepting of his identity as an openly gay individual, reminding the audience of the distinction that must be made in such situations.
“You have to remember which baggage is yours and what’s someone else’s,” Van Ness said. 
The closeness of Van Ness and Brown’s friendship was apparent throughout the conversation, as they constantly butted in to compliment or affirm one another with an “amen” or “yas, queen.” When discussing sensitive topics, including Brown’s recent public admission that he had attempted suicide at age 26, Van Ness comfortingly placed a hand on Brown’s knee.
They discussed the importance of having a support system of fellow queers and allies, citing each other as examples in their own lives. Brown brought up how just on the car ride to USC, Van Ness distressed about a personal problem and Brown offered him constant affirmations: “I got you. I support you. I’m with you. I love you.” 
Karliak asked why the pair had a particularly close working relationship, which they attributed to their disparate yet well-matched personalities. 
“Karamo is genuinely inquisitive and caring and calm … from the screen to real life that’s very much the case,” Van Ness said. 
“It’s funny because the opposite of me being very is someone [like Jonathan] who’s like, ‘This is me, baby, and you’re gonna love it no matter what,’” Brown said. “I think he and I are opposites ends on the spectrum … so when I see him I’m like, ‘Yeah, we would have totally dated before we both got married to our respective spouses.’” 
“And I’m like, ‘Don’t you write a check you cannot cash, honey,’” Van Ness quibbed back to rampant laughter from the crowd. 
After the talk, students participated in a Q&A session. They also brought up issues that are grappled with beyond and within the LGBTQ+ community such as the exclusion and erasure of certain sexual identities, with Van Ness saying he thinks transgender people are underrepresented on “Queer Eye.” 
Student attendees were enthused by the stars’ presences but wanted to hear more about the show’s production as it enters its upcoming third season, which will take place in St. Louis after completing two seasons in Atlanta. 
“It was exciting to see the stars of ‘Queer Eye’ in person and see how vibrant and true to the show their personalities were,” said Rudy Falagan, a sophomore majoring in fine arts, who attended the talk. “I did wish they talked about the show more critically and allowed for a more holistic discussion of the show and how to improve its message in the future.”
With regard to his vision for the future of “Queer Eye,” Brown said he wanted to see a more gender-inclusive Fab Five, a nickname for the show’s five stars which also comprises stylist Tan France, chef Antoni Porowski and designer Bobby Berk. 
“Five men are not the arbiters of all things amazing … we need to tell network executives, with our dollars, that we want someone who identifies as trans, or as gender-queer,” Brown said.

Harlem-based rapper Azealia Banks performed to a ravenous crowd of dedicated fans at her Los Angeles show Thursday night at the iconic Fonda Theatre. (Sasha Urban | Daily Trojan)
Azealia Banks’ biggest hit is “212,” but on Thursday night, she performed in the 323 to a packed house at The Fonda Theatre. At her third of four California performances this month, Banks delivered a raucous yet intimate hour-long set, including fresh renditions of her classic songs and dynamic vocal stylings.  
Banks released her debut album, “Broke With Expensive Taste,” in 2014, and she has since pushed the envelope of hip-hop and pop with her creative lyrics and flow, as well as her wide range of musical influences — from house and Brazilian to seapunk. Her most recent music video for “Anna Wintour” has garnered over five million views on YouTube, while her video for “212” has over 159 million views. 
On Thursday night, the crowd was a melting pot of races, sexual orientations and genders, and an excited buzz was palpable from outside the theater. 
The stage was simple — a drum set and DJ booth labeled “SLAY-Z: AZEALIA BANKS” took up the back half, while the front half was reserved for Banks and her two ferocious back-up dancers. 
The set kicked off around 9 p.m. with an unnamed opening performer who had little impact outside of building anticipation for Banks’ arrival. For the following two hours, audience members smoked marijuana, chatted and scrolled through their phones, undeterred by the increasingly tight indoor quarters. 
Banks energetically opened with “Chi Chi,” a single from 2017. She sported a form-fitting denim outfit and a short black bob (as featured in her “Anna Wintour” video), which she jokingly adjusted throughout the set while smirking at the audience.
Banks performed 15 songs in her one-hour spot and barely spoke a word to the crowd — but she didn’t need to. The entire concert felt like an inside joke between Banks and the audience, and she spoke through her music.
A few times Banks began a new song by performing the bridge a cappella, which seemed odd coming from someone who writes lyrics according to the beat. She describes the practice as being “ … like a mute person [trying] to tell a story, like I have to speak for them,” evidenced in her ability to rap over complex house music-inspired production.  
Occasionally Banks was timid in her deliveries, but she built on them throughout her performance, reaching new heights of fervor during “Anna Wintour” and “Miss Amor.” But nothing could beat the fever pitch that was “212,” which sent the audience into conniptions. Banks closed her set with an encore performance of “Yung Rapunxel,” which included the use of a megaphone.  
Banks is known for her outspokenness on politics and pop culture, which she communicates to her fanbase regularly through Instagram and Twitter. 
But most recently, Banks has gained attention for her line of soaps, which she sells as merchandise after her shows, as well as online. Occasionally she passes out free bars of her homemade soap to the front row, but Thursday night’s audience missed out on potential freebies. 
But audience members didn’t need any presents to placate them; one zealous fan even threw a hairpiece onto the stage in a fervor. 
If her fanbase is any indication, Azealia Banks is a breath of fresh air in today’s music scene. She is both unexpectedly eclectic and genuinely talented, as well as wholly unapologetic. Banks demonstrated Thursday what her devoted fans have always known: She is truly one-of-a-kind as both an artist and performer.

Dariel Filomeno | Daily Trojan
When rapper Cardi B emerged from the Harper’s Bazaar Fashion Week ICONS event with a torn dress and a welt on her forehead, the internet lost its collective mind. The beef that had existed only in rumor between her and fellow rapper Nicki Minaj finally came to a head. Both sides spoke out on what they felt caused Cardi B’s outburst and within the week, most people who cared to have an opinion picked a side. 
Rivalry is an integral part of rap. Biggie vs. Tupac. Jay-Z vs. Nas, Drake vs. Meek Mill. Rap beefs continue to push the genre forward by fostering competition and captivating audiences. 
But, this feud is different. This isn’t two rappers going toe-to-toe with impressive flows and lyrical dexterity. Rather, it’s Cardi B and Nicki Minaj insisting their right to be angry was based on hearsay and the rabidness of their fan bases. The think pieces on the feud are well-intentioned, but are hardly worth the unnecessary drama and exhaustion of the ordeal.
At one point during the fallout, a Twitter user asked if there were any unproblematic female rappers at all. They were quote-tweeted a couple thousand times, and by the time it reached my feed, the most popular response was “Blue Ivy.” 
Needless to say, I was disheartened. In fact, this exchange made me more upset than the vitriol between the two female rappers. It wasn’t what it said about them, but what it revealed about us — the consumers — and our role in the Nicki-Cardi fight.
The think pieces would tell you that this drama was avoidable. The problem is that we as a society habitually pit women against each other and encourage them to hate until it erupts with Cardi B throwing a shoe. It’s a good sentiment, but it’s been said before and kind of feels tired at this point. 
Yes, we need to improve the music industry by supporting women instead of encouraging them to tear each other down. Girls are trained to judge each other at a young age. Women supporting each other is a radical notion that could really do some good.
The issue I have is that simply teaching women to respect each other won’t work if there aren’t any prominent women in the first place. Just look at the reviews for Minaj’s latest album “Queen.” I dare you to find one that doesn’t point out that for the longest time she remained uncontested as the preeminant female rapper. 
Then came Cardi B, and some began to question Minaj’s place in the rap world. “Queen” is her clapback, a declaration that she is still relevant and worth taking seriously in a post-Cardi B world. Music critics and fans alike simplify the female rap scene to a binary, where your choices in are made out to be only Nicki Minaj or Cardi B.
Why is that? There’s clearly no shortage of rappers. The best rap album of 2018 so far was put out by a woman, and it was neither Cardi B nor Nicki Minaj. To prepare for her album “Chime,” Minnesota rapper Dessa participated in a brain imaging study to see if she could understand on a neurological level why she couldn’t get over an ex-boyfriend. 
The resulting album deals with loss, heartbreak and the lived experiences of women in an authentic and mesmerizing way. There isn’t a bad song or wasted line, as Dessa asserts her dominance and lays out her shortcomings, backed with ambient synths and thundering strings. The self-proclaimed “vixen of the wolfpack” lays everything bare and takes no prisoners.
We’re not talking about “Chime” though. Instead, we’d rather get sucked into a vortex of pointless drama, while what could be the album of the year goes vastly unlistened. 
That’s a shame. Dessa deserves better. Women deserve better. Why should we have to settle for either Nicki Minaj or Cardi B when there’s a whole world of female rappers out there waiting for the public to expand their horizons to? 
We have the depth and talent to tip the male-dominated genre in our favor if we just cared to look out for it. 
Instead of accepting whatever Spotify-curated playlists as the only viable musical option, we should be challenging ourselves by listening to the women rocking the boat and taking the world by storm with prowess and dignity. We must work on creating a scene that doesn’t encourage women to fight each other by first supporting the already established women who just need a bigger audience. 
We can all have Nicki, Cardi, Dessa, CupcakKe, Jean Grae and every other talented female rapper so long as we open our ears. Maybe then we can move on from pointless internet feuds and get to a truly vibrant and gender inclusive rap game.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Starting on Sept. 9, the Syrian government and its Russian ally engaged in a deadly strike against rebel-controlled areas in northwest Syria. The attacks — just some of 1,060 in the span of 72 hours — killed at least five people, including a baby and a young child.
Syria has been in shambles since March 2011, when the divided nation joined the tide of social unrest that constituted the Arab Spring. These latest attacks confirm that, plagued by a raging civil war, the country will continue to suffer from one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II. They also confirm that Syria’s population will continue to suffer from one of the worst mental health crises the world has ever seen. And the worst part? Nobody cares.
I could write a 10-page paper considering the different causes of Americans’ general apathy toward Syrian people: maybe it’s due to decreased media coverage, internalized racism or that the seven-year war is simply old news. Perhaps it’s all of the above. Regardless, the point is that people would rather hear about President Donald Trump’s latest controversial tweet than a chemical weapons attack on children in the Idlib Governorate. 
So in case you haven’t been tuning in recently, here’s a snapshot of the crisis still unfolding: According to the 2018 World Report by Human Rights Watch, over 400,000 people have died in the war. Five million of those who survived sought refuge overseas, and six million have been driven from their homes in the country. Turning the focus toward mental health concerns, two out of three Syrian children have either “lost a loved one, had their house bombed or shelled or suffered war-related injuries,” according to The Washington Post. If that’s not enough, the report states that one out of four children are at risk of developing a mental health disorder. 
The last statistic should stand out because, in addition to taking innocent lives and driving families from their homes, the crisis in Syria is producing an entire generation of children who will feel the invisible wounds of war for years to come. While the U.S. discusses Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin’s wedding, a six-year-old somewhere in Syria is losing his ability to speak after witnessing his friend’s murder; a 10-year-old is watching her mother die from a bombing strike; a 15-year-old is lured into joining a terrorist organization that promises him a new purpose in life.
This summer, I had the pleasure of working for a nonprofit organization that specializes in providing art therapy workshops and raising funds to combat growing mental health concerns among young Syrian refugees. Among our chief concerns was preventing negative coping mechanisms, or reactions to trauma that may result in aggressive or risky behavior. While it was fulfilling to know my work as an intern was at least indirectly supporting those desperately in need, it was also deeply sobering to consider just how many people’s lives were forever changed by a war they did not support in the first place. And given that there were about 100 psychiatrists for 22 million people in Syria before the crisis started, it’s safe to assume Art of Hope’s work is far from over.
To be clear, the objective of this column is not to shame those who haven’t been shouting for peace and providing direct humanitarian aid to Syrian children; rather, I want to inform readers that this war is much, much worse than they think — and it has become increasingly difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The onus is primarily on peacekeeping organizations such as the United Nations to make good on their promises and put an end to these senseless attacks, as well as the United States to accept — at the very least — more than a few refugees a month.
But as people with beating hearts and, hopefully, some shred of human decency, we should share at least some of the burden. In Syria, it would be an understatement to characterize the discussion of mental health as taboo. In addition to the barrier of access to psychiatrists and other similar professionals in the country, people with mental health issues are shamed and labeled majnun, which means “crazy” in Arabic. Therefore, as people with the platform to discuss these issues, we should become a voice for the refugees suffering from war, to stay informed about their mental health concerns and keep the conversation going — because these scars will last long after the war ends.
If there’s anything to keep in mind while we click through news programs and articles detailing the latest atrocities in the Middle East, it’s that Syrian refugees are, first and foremost, human. They are people who have lost the only homes they’ve ever known; they are people who have witnessed the senseless murders of their friends and family; they are people desperately escaping terrorism while being called terrorists themselves. They are people, undone by war.

In 1993, I was molested by Dr. George Tyndall when I sought medical care from the Engemann Student Health Center. At the time, it didn’t occur to me that a crime had been committed. Over the years, I have struggled to come to terms with what happened to me. It wasn’t until several months ago when I began seeing news reports about other victims that I realized a punishable crime had been committed against me 23 years earlier.
I love my alma mater. As a proud daughter of Troy, I am forever part of the Trojan Family. However, I also recognize that in its current form, USC is deeply flawed. The Trojan Family is dysfunctional.
What happened to me and hundreds of other women at USC under Dr. Tyndall’s “care” should have never happened, nor been allowed to continue for nearly 30 years.
The fall semester has begun, and parents of current students have sent their children off to school trusting that they will be safe and well cared for. To start this new academic year on the right foot, the Board of Trustees must advocate for an honest reckoning and a fresh beginning — for truth, reconciliation and accountability. Specifically, the Board must undertake the following: 
Give us a seat at the table. 
Every victim of Tyndall’s deserves to share her story in order to get to the bottom of the colossal missteps in this case. Don’t just leave the investigation to expensive law firms. Listen to us. Closely. 
Revisit the action plan.
Hatched with breathtaking speed mere days after the revelations in the Tyndall case, the 20-page action plan is ambitious. How many of the intended changes outlined in the action plan have actually been implemented? Our mission must be to serve as a model of institutional reform at USC, to be replicated elsewhere.
Don’t shelve reports from internal investigations. 
If USC truly wants a fresh start, make the findings of the internal investigation public. Transparency can be painful, but USC has a long way to go before it can shed its reputation for massive cover-ups that enabled egregious misconduct to fester for far too long, until it blew up into full-fledged crisis. 
Convince us that the renewal at USC will be real. 
Why was the Board so slow to comment and act on Tyndall and other current scandals? Why did it take so long to prompt President C. L. Max Nikias to leave? How is change possible when Nikias continues to serve as life trustee who will onboard interim president Wanda Austin? This is no more than a game of musical chairs. This half-hearted ousting is not enough. Shouldn’t more administrators be asked to leave? For example, Provost Michael Quick? 
Change governance. 
Self-examination is central to the understanding of our function and purpose. A board of 57 voting members is too big to function effectively and efficiently. The secrecy surrounding the membership of the executive committee should be lifted. The board has shown itself to be too cozy with the president and the administration. It is also time to include more women and minorities, and to elect faculty and student trustees to ensure greater transparency.
USC has produced some of the finest alumni in the country. But it’s time for the University to chart a new course. I am part of an accidental sisterhood of hundreds of women and we are not going away. To steer away from scandal in the future, the University must shed its culture of secrecy and silence and abandon business as usual. USC needs to reaffirm its commendable values — not just in word, but in action.

Jonathon Xue/Daily Trojan
A username linked to a USC graduate student’s email address was active in a chatroom used to organize the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. last year, according to screenshots obtained by the Daily Trojan and leaked chat logs. 
The screenshots connect the email of Robert L. Walker II, a doctoral student in petroleum engineering and research assistant at the Southern California Earthquake Center, to the alias “n—onaut” used in multiple chatrooms on Discord, a messaging platform cited in a federal lawsuit against “Unite the Right” rally organizers. 
A screenshot, shared with the Daily Trojan by former editor Razzan Nakhlawi, shows Walker’s email in a private chat where different users post contact information on Discord. Nakhlawi said she obtained the information in May from an unnamed source. A separate Twitter user posted a different screenshot also showing Walker’s email on Sept. 10. 
The Daily Trojan was unable to independently verify the screenshots, but verified Walker’s email in USC’s student directory.
The username associated with Walker’s email shared graphic images of lynchings, used racial slurs and expressed interest in guns on Discord throughout 2017. The user also said he attended the “Unite the Right” rally, which resulted in the death of counterprotester Heather Heyer.
Walker did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the Daily Trojan did not receive an official response from USC in time for publication. 
The Southern California Earthquake Center told the Daily Trojan via a Twitter message that it relayed allegations regarding Walker’s account to USC administrators.
On Sunday, Provost Michael Quick released a public statement citing “recent online allegations regarding a USC graduate student.” He did not name the student and the Daily Trojan was unable to verify that the memo specifically referenced the username associated with Walker’s email and its comments in the chat log. In the memo, Quick condemned hate speech as “dehumanizing, degrading, toxic, and vile.”
“While we are guided by our unwavering fidelity to free speech, it is also true that we do not tolerate threatening or intimidating conduct, or any other behavior that jeopardizes the safety of our community,” Quick wrote.
Allegations that Walker was “n—onaut” were first made public via Twitter on Sept. 8 by activist Emily Gorcenski, who accused Walker of targeting her on Discord. Following the “Unite the Right” rally, Gorcenski said that she and other activists have been threatened and harassed by white nationalists.
“We were aware that a significant amount of this harassment was organized, coordinated, and fomented in private chats, particularly the Charlottesville 2.0 Discord server,” Gorcenski wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “When the messages got leaked, it became clear that ‘n—onaut’ made specific references to me in this server, at one point referencing the timestamp of a video I appeared in.”
Gorcenski said she decided to publicly denounce Walker, in connection to the username “n—onaut,” due to public safety concerns. She said she had been aware of the user’s identity since May, but was unable to independently verify it until nonprofit media collective Unicorn Riot leaked the Discord chat logs in August. 
The chat logs show that in February 2017, “n—onaut” identified themselves as a doctoral engineering student based in Los Angeles. The user also shared their Skype and Twitter handle in the chat room. The handle coincides with an account on Github, a software development platform, linked to a “usc.edu” email used by Walker for academic projects, the Daily Trojan later confirmed. Gorcenski first posted about Walker’s Github account on her Twitter account.
According to his LinkedIn, Walker attended Marietta College in Ohio for his undergraduate education.
In 2008, a Marietta College student with the same name failed to appear in court in Ohio for a concealed weapon charge, a fourth-degree felony. The charge came after campus police discovered a semi-automatic rifle, shotgun, pistol and 1,000 rounds of ammunition in his car parked on school property, according to a local TV news station’s report. 
A nationwide arrest warrant was distributed, since officials believed the student left the United States for Madrid, the report said. 
According to the Twitter account “n—onaut” shared on Discord, the user is currently in Madrid and publicly tweeted about their arrival on Sept. 13.
