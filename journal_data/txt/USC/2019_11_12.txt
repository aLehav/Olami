In a game where seniors guard Jonah Mathews and forward Nick Rakocevic recorded their 1,000th career points in Trojan uniforms, the USC men’s basketball team pulled away late for a 84-66 win to continue its perfect start to the season.
It was a battle of unbeaten teams at Galen Center Tuesday night as the 2-0 Trojans went up against 3-0 South Dakota State. USC was coming off early-season wins against Florida A&M and Portland thanks to a number of talented freshmen, while the Jackrabbits tallied victories over  UT Rio Grande Valley, Peru State and CSU Bakersfield.
The second half was a back-and-forth battle between the two teams. But after a 3-pointer from Jackrabbits senior guard Brandon Key made it a 1-point game with 15:31 left, the Trojans went on to score 12 consecutive points and never looked back. 
“I’ve been through a lot of tight games during my four years here, so it wasn’t really stressful,” said Mathews said of the Jackrabbits’ comeback effort. “We just had to come together, get stops, make good plays. And we happened to do that down the stretch. Slowing it down, executing plays, [getting] steals, just shutting the game out.”
Both teams got off to a slow start in the first half. USC finished the first half shooting 35% from the field, going 14-for-40 and 4-for-17 from the arc. The Jackrabbits, meanwhile, shot 40% from the field, and 3-of-12 from behind the 3-point line.
It didn’t take long for USC to build a lead in the first half, as it jumped out to a quick 13-point advantage. However, it didn’t last long, as the Jackrabbits went on a 14-8 run to enter halftime down by only 7 points.
Rakocevic had a dominant first half, matching his season scoring total coming in with 15 points and recording 10 rebounds. Junior forward Douglas Wilson and freshman guard/forward David Wingett both scored 8 points in the first half for SDSU. 
USC had a much better second half, shooting 46% and grabbing 18 rebounds. Although it was once a close game, USC finished the contest without ever giving up the lead.
The difference in the game came down to turnovers. The Trojans took advantage of the Jackrabbits’ 18 turnovers, turning them into 13 points. In addition, SDSU also committed 26 personal fouls compared to USC’s 15.
The second half included two of the more memorable plays in recent USC history, as Mathews and Rakocevic scored their 1,000th career points. Mathews, who has played 105 career games as a Trojan, came into the Tuesday’s night game with 995 points. Rakocevic entered his 108th career game 20 points away from the milestone.
“To have two guys like Jonah and Nick, who came in together, who scored their 1,000th point on the same evening is pretty cool,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “So we’re excited for them, they have a chance to do something special this year together, to be leaders of the team.”
Rakocevic continued his hot first half, scoring 12 points and pulling down six rebounds in the second. He finished with a team high 27 points and 16 rebounds while adding five steals.
Rakocevic said although he had a hot hand, his teammates allowed him to utilize his size against a smaller South Dakota State team.
“My teammates did a good job of getting me the ball and just getting me in good positions to score the ball, and I was just taking advantage of the size I had over them,” Rakocevic said. “My teammates played a big factor in that and just getting me in that position to score easy points.”
The 3-0 start is a promising sign for a team that missed out on the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive year last season.
The Trojans will now travel to Nevada for their first away game of the season. They take on the Wolf Pack in an 8 p.m. tilt Saturday.

The PGA U.S. Open was held at the Chambers Bay Golf Club in my hometown of University Place, Wash., in 2015. The tournament featured veterans such as Phil Mickelson and new, upcoming players like Jordan Spieth. When the four-day tournament ended, the 21-year-old Spieth became the youngest U.S. Open champion in 92 years.
At the time, I didn’t know much about the sport. The only reason I cared about the U.S. Open was that it ended school early for me due to the amount of people that were expected to arrive for the tournament.
I wasn’t able to attend the Open, but I got a glimpse of just how popular golf really was. The fact that people from all over the world traveled to attend the tournament amazed me. I thought the sport was mostly played recreationally — I never expected this level of passion.
Just like tennis, golf has four major tournaments: the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship. Nearly 1,000 golfers make up the official golf rankings. But apart from the most popular names such as Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson, most people aren’t that familiar with many golfers.
It’s not as though golf is entirely dead, however. One of the most well-known golfers of all time is Tiger Woods. Woods, tied for the most PGA Tour wins ever, formerly held the No. 1 ranking for an unprecedented 683 weeks. Woods helped keep golf alive in a country dominated by sports like basketball and football.
Luckily for the sport, its popularity is trending slightly upward. Masters Sunday this year was the most-watched golf broadcast in history with more than 18 million viewers in the final round. Much of this improvement can be attributed to the recent success of Woods — who won his fifth green jacket that day — after being MIA from golf for much of this decade, but its popularity is still a surprise. 
Furthermore, around 6% of athletes who play golf in high school go on to play golf in college — almost double the conversion mark in basketball. Still, in terms of numbers, there are more than 500,000 male high school basketball players, compared to 144,000 male golfers.
So as popular as golf is becoming, there are still not that many participants. This may be because golf is an expensive sport to pick up and not as easy to get involved in as other sports, but the main reason is where golf is played.
It’s easy to practice hitting a golf ball against a net, but the best practice is actually going to a golf course and hitting a ball in real conditions. This alone can often be expensive and time-consuming, so people have to go well out of their way to play even a single round of golf. 
For example, USC’s golf teams have recently been quite successful. Last season, however, the men’s team placed seventh in the Pac-12 Men’s Golf Championship. Though it was not the finish the team was hoping for, former Trojan Justin Suh placed fourth individually and was named to his third consecutive All-Pac-12 team.
The women’s team, on the other hand, exceeded all expectations last season when they won the Pac-12 Women’s Golf Championship, its fifth in the last 12 years. Junior Gabriela Ruffels was one of the main reasons for the team’s success. The reigning U.S. Women’s Amateur champion is ranked No. 20 coming into this season.
But it’s still a challenge for the golf teams at USC to practice. Since there is not a golf course on or near campus, the McKay Center features a state-of-the-art golf facility. Players can practice their skills on an interactive screen that imitates an actual golf course.
This is possible for a large university like USC, but for smaller colleges that don’t have as many resources, obtaining a virtual golf simulation is just not possible. Because of this, it’s not surprising to see that there are many more athletes involved in sports such as football and basketball, which can be played almost anywhere. 
In spite of this, people who want to pursue golf should not let obstacles like price or location stop them. I remember “playing golf” on my Wii and imagining how cool it would be to play in real life.
Some of today’s greatest athletes have come from golf, and it’s unfortunate that not many people realize this due to its reputation for featuring out of shape, unathletic players. Luckily for the sport, people who do like to play and watch golf are generally quite passionate about it. Golf is an entertaining sport that should not be forgotten — and in my opinion, it will only continue to rise.

The Trojans will look to add another road victory to their record after barely holding on to win in Tempe, Ariz., last Saturday against the Sun Devils. 
The team’s youth and inconsistency, which have plagued it this season despite all of its talent, reared its ugly head in the last three quarters against ASU. The Trojans were outscored 19-3 after a dominant performance by freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis brought the lead to 28-7 after 15 minutes.
Slovis was happy about the team’s performance to start the game off but said that the team will need to be less lackadaisical on the sideline moving forward. 
“[In the first quarter,] that’s what it looks like when everyone does their job and is consistent,” Slovis said. “But at times later in the game, it just took one guy or two guys not doing their job, and a lot of that was me.” 
Slovis had to adjust to taking snaps from the backup center redshirt freshman Justin Dedich after redshirt sophomore Brett Neilon left with an injury in the third quarter. 
Although the win left many with a sour taste, there was plenty of good to take away as well. With its sixth win of the season, USC secured bowl eligibility after missing out on the postseason last year. 
But head coach Clay Helton isn’t satisfied with just a bowl appearance. 
“We have higher expectations here at USC, and there’s a lot of ball to be played,” Helton said. “We’re one game back from being Pac-12 South champions, so we’ve got to do our job. And that job is to go up to Cal and try to get another tough on the road victory against a team that just played a very good game.”
Cal, a team that started off the season at 4-0 and rose to No. 15 on the AP poll, has struggled mightily since its hot start. Still, a 33-20 victory over Washington State put the Bears at 5-4 on the season, proving that they’re still capable of playing like the top team they were earlier in the year.
“Anytime you play a [Cal head coach] Justin Wilcox team, you know the defense is going to be extremely well coached and it’s evident on tape,” Helton said of the Bears’ defense, which is led by senior insider linebacker Evan Weaver. 
Weaver leads the nation in tackles with 136 to go along with 2.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. 
Due to injuries and strong performance, freshman running back Kenan Christon will no longer redshirt this season, as the offense is now leaning on him.
Luckily for the Trojans, they should get some help going up against that Bears’ front, as running backs redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai and junior Stephen Carr practiced Tuesday and looked explosive. Their presence would help take some pressure off Christon. 
Christon found himself thrust into the limelight after a crowded backfield became riddled with injuries.
“He’s been playing, he’s been contributing, he’s been dominating and doing everything he’s been asked and more,” Malepeai said.
Though he acknowledged that Christon has performed well since stepping into the starting role, Malepeai said he wants to return this weekend to help the Trojans leave Cal with a win.
“If God grants me the ability to play this week and my body is feeling up to it, I’m going to go ahead and contribute in any way that I can,” Malepeai said. “You can’t make the club in the tub.”
Sophomore wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown has also continued to take snaps from running back and will help take pressure off of the run game.
“It’s something that I did growing up my whole life,” St. Brown said of playing in the backfield. “It’s nothing new to me, so I’m comfortable.”
Redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns left practice early Tuesday to receive treatment for an injured ankle, so the team may need freshman wide receiver Drake London to come up big once again — something that his quarterback is confident he can do.
“You guys see the catches on TV and the big games, but he’s been a stud since he walked in here,” Slovis said. “I’m really proud of him — he’s stepped up big time.”
With two games to go in the season, the Trojans have an opportunity to show just what type of team they are. Although it seems unlikely that they’ll compete for a Pac-12 championship, they still have a lot to play for. Finishing the season strong would both land the team in a better bowl game and show how close it is to achieving greatness.

I grew up on the internet. At age 4, the family computer became my sanctuary, and dress-up games were my go-to. Once I reached age 12, I graduated from Stardoll, Jojo’s Fashion Show and girlsgogames.com and moved onto older, more sophisticated Tumblr blogs and Polyvore sets despite not meeting the distant age requirement of 13.  
Through social media, I found an appreciation for fashion and style that was far beyond the reaches of the J-14 magazine I hid in my parents’ grocery basket at Save Mart. It’s how anyone in the fashion world learns about anything these days — what better way to keep up on the latest trends than seeing them worn by real people in real time? 
At USC, we keep up with these trends whether we want to or not. We’ve all seen international students who look like a million dollars at their 8 a.m. lectures, acutely famous kids whose entire Instagram feeds are a flex and “Choose-Your-Fighter”-looking squads posted up at art shows. Recently, we even saw a viral post of anti-FILA Disruptor signs placed around USC Village. 
So who’s covering these trends, aside from humble columnist yours truly at the Daily Trojan?
SPEC Magazine: a student-run publication at USC that focuses on fashion, culture and lifestyle. Its blog is updated weekly, and the magazine is printed every semester. With three issues under its belt, its goal is to serve as a creative outlet for USC students interested in writing about beauty and style. With nearly 100 members, the club aims to be as inclusive as possible, an important consideration when most organizations on campus are extremely selective.
My first impression of SPEC was made when I stumbled across their Instagram page a couple weeks ago. Photos of students rocking denim on school bleachers, sifting through records, and sitting in front of murals wearing bold prints and platform boots gave me hope that taking pride in one’s style at this school isn’t dead. An edgier photo shows off a manicure with hands covering a woman’s eyes — the woman is biting on a gold chain.
The real star of the show, however, is the online version of the magazine. On the magazine’s website, you can find the Spring 2018 issue, which features a plethora of street style images, dorm room ideas, beauty products and even a piece on student activism at USC.
I spoke with SPEC’s president Bailey Boccia, a senior majoring in business administration, about the fashion trends she thinks are most relevant to USC students. She told me that SPEC photoshoots have played with themes from Neon Cowboy and The New ’90s to business attire with a Gen Z twist and “Euphoria”-esque makeup and to expect all of them in their upcoming issue.
“In our past issue, we did the ’70s,” Boccia said. “I kind of feel like those older trends are coming back in different ways.”
Every week, SPEC highlights a USC student to be its fashion icon of the week. The questions asked include how they would describe their style, pick their outfits and stay up to date on the latest trends.
“I get a lot of my fashion news from Instagram,” recent icon Elle Gennis, a junior majoring in communication, said. “I’d literally wake up and watch Instagram stories for hours to see all my favorite designers’ newest collections.”
Not all of their writing is strictly fashion-oriented, however. One of my favorite SPEC articles to read was titled “Compliment-Giving 101: A Guide to Proper Compliment Etiquette.” Although I must say there really is no better compliment than saying “that’s hot” in Paris Hilton’s unapologetically nasal voice. 
Culture and style journalism is important, especially to a generation of students like me who grew up taking fashion inspiration from hashtags and influencers. That’s why, in my opinion, SPEC Magazine is definitely hot. 
Copies of SPEC are available at its events and involvement fair booths, and the magazine’s Instagram is @specmagusc.

Director Mike Flanagan faced a nearly insurmountable challenge when he was tasked with directing “Doctor Sleep,” the adaptation of Stephen King’s best-selling novel and the sequel to Stanley Kubrick’s horror classic, “The Shining.” In all of Hollywood’s history, perhaps the most public clash of creative difference occurred between King and Kubrick in the making of “The Shining” in 1980. 
It’s been well-documented that the famous writer did not appreciate Kubrick’s deviations on his praised work. Kubrick’s psychological study leaned away from King’s supernatural horror, changing crucial plot points and elements. 
All of this makes Flanagan’s “Doctor Sleep” all the more fascinating. Not only did Flanagan have to adapt the film’s source material, he also had to honor King’s original piece inside the same visual texture of Kubrick’s classic. Does it work? Oh, yeah. 
“Doctor Sleep” flawlessly combines its three influences in one triumphant return back to the chills of the Overlook Hotel. 
Picking up decades after the grim events at the Overlook, “Doctor Sleep” finds Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) a scarred alcoholic running from his past. Haunted by his childhood trauma, Dan lives a very lonely life, drifting from place to place. When a nefarious nomadic cult — which feeds off of people with the psychic ability to “Shine” — finds a young girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran) who can “Shine” even stronger than he ever could, Dan must overcome his inner demons to protect her from harm. 
“Doctor Sleep” may be centered on the familiar character of Dan Torrance, but the film is spearheaded by three separate protagonists. Dan, Abra and Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), the leader of the nomadic cult of Shiners, each drive the plot forward separately toward a massive collision course. Much like a novel or a miniseries, the film takes its time to put its pieces in place as the momentum builds further and further, pulling no punches. However, the finale is more than worth the wait. 
One of the greatest strengths of the film is in the fantastic lead performances. McGregor is brutally riveting in his portrayal of an older, haunted Dan Torrance. McGregor brings an authenticity to his performance that feels true to the young kid seen in Kubrick’s film, yet he adds new layers to the character. Newcomer Curran also does a terrific job as the brave Abra Stone, creating an engaging young protagonist to root for. Lastly, Ferguson may even steal the show with her electrifying and creepy Rose the Hat; her singular performance earns significantly more screen time than the average movie villain. 
From the opening sequence, Flanagan makes his intent clear to honor the “old,” yet offer something “new.” Flanagan makes sure the film takes its time to build new expansions on the narrative before returning to the classic setting of the original. He still gives fans what they want with authentic production design and shot-by-shot homages to Kubrick’s original; however, the film truly stands on its own as a separate piece with its own novelty, which serves as a fitting companion to its predecessor. Flanagan’s dialogue and editing feel very Kubrick-esque, but with his own flair to it. The cinematography genuinely tries to make every shot artistic and meaningful, giving the film distinct artistry. Finally, the Newton Brothers create a chilling score, which knows just when to cue the original theme to a thrilling effect.
For all these technical triumphs, perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is in the subject matter itself. “Doctor Sleep” tells a very honest depiction of sobriety, trauma and PTSD. The film’s horror elements work wonderfully in parallel to Dan’s struggle with alcoholism and the shadow of his father. Sometimes abuse and trauma only leads to the same cycle, and it is nice to see big studio films depict that unflinchingly. 
While Kubrick’s “The Shining” was going deeper and deeper into someone’s inner madness, Flanagan’s “Doctor Sleep” is about someone finding a way out of that darkness towards something more peaceful, whatever that may be. This alone makes “Doctor Sleep” one of the best films of the year.

Internationally recognized New Zealand choreographer Neil Ieremia brought his contemporary dance company Black Grace to Bovard Auditorium to showcase a collection of pieces celebrating his company’s repertoire Monday evening. The New Zealand-based dance group, founded in 1995, mixes contemporary movement with Ieremia’s Samoan and New Zealand heritage.
As the audience sat in total darkness, barely able to make out the line of dancers rushing on stage holding hands, a single hum hung in the air. It came from one dancer, then another and then another until the group of six hummed in harmony. No one had moved since the first hum, which isn’t a typical sight in a dance work. 
The lights rose, revealing two drummers behind the dancers who are providing a now-discernible rhythm with beautiful syncopation. The rest of the piece flies by with a flurry of contemporary and South Pacific choreography driven by the speeding drummers.
Ieremia’s choreography incorporates frequent body percussion inspired by Samoan Sasa and Fa’ataupati, a traditional slap dance that aligns with the intricate drum rhythm, adding another level of physical and musical complexity. In a Q&A with Kaufman School of Dance Vice Dean and director Jodie Gates, Ieremia discussed the significance of this first piece, “Kiona and the Little Bird Suite.”
“The piece is a collection of all the movement, movement phrases, motifs and all sorts of things from the last 25 years of Black Grace,” Ieremia said.
According to the event’s program, the disparity between historical and modern modes of artistic expression in the work — especially relating to the music — is an intentional decision that provides a space for these modes to interact.
“The mixture of live and recorded sound is an acknowledgement of the meeting place of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary,” the program read.
Ieremia draws from some of his most celebrated repertoire, which confront an array of topics from child abuse to peace. The event also exposed the audience to themes of toxic masculinity, freedom and  matriarchys in New Zealand culture.
One notable thing about Black Grace is its uncompromising drive to blur the lines between celebrating tradition and welcoming modern forms of expression. Ieremia is also no stranger to utilizing art that originates outside of the South Pacific by setting some of his work to classical European composers like Antonio Vivaldi. 
Ieremia admitted he has received wide-eyed stares and many questions in response to his choices that overtly deviate from the cultures he set out to celebrate. However, Iremia said mixing art from different cultures creates something new and original.
“We’re all the same people, aren’t we?” Ieremia said. “We’re all just doing the same thing. We breathe the same air. They expected me to continue to use wooden drums and nets and grass skirts because that’s what we’re supposed to do. But I just thought that was ridiculous.”
The choreographer tackled the difficult conversation surrounding cultural appropriation in art by suggesting that humanity is our most basic connection. Looking beyond the veils of guarded traditions and cultural norms, we can try to release the tendency to preserve our culture when we reject intermixing between cultures.
Black Grace’s explosive movements also intertwine beautifully to slower, classical music from baroque musical composers Vivaldi and Johann Sebastian Bach. Ieremia seems to be a master at fusing the conventional with the unusual through choreography, theme and music. 
Black Grace previously performed at Bovard Auditorium in 2015. Visions and Voices Executive Director Daria Yudacufski said the company did not travel to the U.S. often, so when she heard they were touring, she took the chance and secured the group’s appearance.
“They really are just this wonderful company,” Yudacufski said. “It’s really wonderful to be able to bring in international artists through Visions and Voices.”
Black Grace moves with a raw power and intense physicality that makes every performance an exhilarating ride. The effective use of counterpoint and canon techniques creates some of the most incredible visuals seen on stage. Ieremia showed he could handle his dancers while also letting each dancer embody their work in a unique way. 
The final presentation is surely a sight to behold, one that demands as much attention from the audience as it demands of its dancers. Through all of Black Grace’s immense energy and creative use of different artistic media, Ieremia establishes the company as one that is willing to take risks. 
In asking questions about the role of toxic masculinity and freedom, Ieremia’s message seems to align with the goals of the Visions and Voices initiative. According to Yudacufski, the program aims to use the arts to inspire students to think about larger social problems and ideas. 
“I want to begin a conversation along the lines of [looking] at the way we treat our fathers,” Ieremia said. “I want us to look at the way we treat our women, and I want us to look more deeply in things that ask some difficult questions.” 
By incorporating international artist events, the initiative engages students on a deep multicultural level that allows the community to explore how people are connected through modern social issues. 
Brianna Pember, a freshman majoring in musical theatre, spoke highly of the performance and held the company’s technical aspects with high regard.
“I love the minimalistic [sic] aspects of it, how there was no set and the costumes were really simple. It was really heavy storytelling, and I feel like I could see everything that they were trying to tell and it was really beautiful.”

As registration season rolls around, the monotony and stressful cycle of lectures, homework and midterms may leave students unsure if they want to voluntarily add another class to an already-packed 16-unit schedule. 
However, a full-time undergraduate student’s tuition covers 18 units, meaning there are two units left over for students to use however they want after making an average full 16-unit schedule. Students should use this space to take a wide variety of two- or one-unit classes available to them. Specifically, students should take a class that pushes them outside of their comfort zone and introduces them to something new. 
In terms of tuition costs, two-unit classes cost approximately $2,300, which is a lot of money that goes to waste if a student does not use those units, especially considering the fact that there are fun elective classes that can essentially be taken pass/no pass that do not affect a student’s GPA. 
Although a student’s hesitation may stem from the concern that an extra course will add to their stress and leave them with less time to do work for their core classes, many of the elective classes offered have actually been proven to reduce stress.
For example, “Yoga” is offered as a one-unit class, and “Beginning Pop/Rock Guitar” is offered as a two-unit class. Studies have shown that both yoga and playing instruments reduce levels of stress, lower blood pressure and decrease heart rate. 
Stressed about a midterm tomorrow? It may seem counterproductive to take time away from studying to practice yoga, but research has shown that practicing yoga significantly increases productivity levels. 
Even if it initially seems like these classes take up time in your day-to-day schedule and lead to more stress, they actually provide valuable tools to combat stress and increase concentration. Therefore, taking time away from regular classes and participating in a one- or two-unit class like yoga will be beneficial in the long run. 
To be sure, the main priority of a student when picking a two- or one-unit course does not have to be stress relief. 
For example, students in the “Surfing” two-unit class head to Santa Monica beach and learn the necessary forecast interpretation and wave recognition skills to surf. A student can also take Theatre in Los Angeles and learn about theater through “a study of acting, playwriting, criticism, stage design, lighting, and dramatic styles.” The class goes on trips to see plays around L.A. and even saw the critically acclaimed musical “Hamilton” in Fall 2017. 
These two-unit classes, among many others, allow students to explore the city and provide a much-needed escape from campus. It may be easy for students to stay within USC’s bubble, which makes it all the more important to take classes that push students to visit the rest of the city and learn while having fun. Field trips do not have to end once students come to college.
Additionally, different schools and majors within USC offer two-unit classes that provide a low-stakes way for students to learn new disciplines outside their intended field of study. Who knows? A two-unit class in the Marshall School of Business about the basics of entrepreneurship or a two-unit class in the Viterbi School of Engineering about web publishing might inspire someone to add a major or minor in that school without that student needing to take a four-unit class. 
The versatile purposes of one- and two-unit classes — whether it’s to destress, explore L.A., learn a new skill or explore a new potential major — make them an extremely valuable resource. Although it may feel like that extra time could be better spent for a nap, in reality, the 18 units covered by tuition presents a unique opportunity to make new friends, learn something new and add novelty to four-year plans that often are more or less cemented.

A soldier stands in front of a courthouse in Pittsboro, N.C. He stands at ease, his fingers wrapped around the barrel of a bronze musket, his Confederate uniform gone green with age. He has stood there peacefully for more than a century — but just last August, the Chatham County Board of Commissioners ruled that the statue was to be taken down.  
Protestors gathered in two groups by the statue, on either side of the adjoining Sanford Road. On the left side of the street were progressives holding anti-racist signs, demanding that the statue — a symbol of a racist history — be demolished. To the right of the road were Chatham residents who stood in the defense of their heritage, waving Confederate flags. 
The scene at the protests, each side spitting rude labels across the road, embodies the long-standing clash between progressive and conservative values in America. It is easy to point to the achievements of progressive movements — emancipation, suffrage, civil rights, labor laws — and decide that the clash has been settled: Progressives move history forward, while conservatives dig their heels into the ground to hold it back. The argument is not without merit; throughout the arc of history, every bend toward justice has been met by the conservators of an unjust status quo. 
But this argument also leaves us with a troubling, divisive stereotype: Progressives are the party of justice, while conservatives stand in the way of progress. The very connotation held by these words — progression against conservation — leaves us with a reductive and unhelpful view of their underlying philosophies. Similarly unhelpful stereotypes are made of progressives, that they are the starry-eyed idealists, their naive aspirations having no hold on the real world. 
The fact that these philosophies have come to be associated with Democrats or Republicans sticks us, politically, on either side of Sanford Road. Each group misapprehends the goals of the other, thus turning their opponents into boogeymen. Conservatives become guardians of broken, racist and unjust systems, while progressives are intent on ruining the nation in their attempts to “perfect” it.
The true ideology of conservatism has nothing to do with bigotry or injustice. Its foundations are in the respect for tradition and a belief in the maintenance of certain values — whether these be religious, constitutional or cultural. 
Take the policies of democratic socialism, one of the most progressive movements currently moving through our nation. The movement aims to take the policies of socialist countries like Sweden and Denmark and apply them to America. Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has said of these policies: “When I talk about democratic socialism, what I mean is moving away from where we are right now.” 
To a conservative, the idea of trading away one’s values and way of life for free health care and college tuition is fundamentally objectionable. In light of the fact that Sweden and Denmark’s socialist giveaways have saddled them with some of the highest tax rates in the world, the conservative desire to maintain American traditions seems somewhat more reasonable. 
But what about the great American traditions of injustice, racism and inequality? Many criticize conservative thinking as regressive, the kind of stuck-in-its-ways mentality that has allowed injustice to persist for as long as it has. Even today, many necessary advancements are stalled back by a desire to keep things more or less the same. 
Still, conservatism cannot be written off as regressive, or worse, racist in itself. The respect for tradition is not a bad thing; there are a great many traditions that we would respecting a respect for the rules of our Constitution. This respect is only faultworthy where the traditions are unjust, and though progressives have historically challenged injustice and exclusion, this does not make progressivism the righter of conservative wrongs. 
Progressivism is often enough wrong — or at least misguided — on its own. The democratic socialist idea of free college tuition sounds like a fair and promising progression, but the same could not be said of its likely outcomes. 
One reason for this is that free tuition actually raises drop out rates, as there is less incentive for students to complete their degrees. One Manhattan Institute study found that graduation rates were actually higher in G-7 countries that charged tuition as opposed to those with free college. This, on top of a host of other practical issues — a direct harm to private colleges, an overcrowding of schools and a $70 billion price tag — shows us that a more conservative approach might be better suited to the problem.
The bottom line is that neither progressivism nor conservatism can be removed without our country stagnating. Without a healthy clash of ideology, the state has only one voice and one direction — not necessarily the right ones. The idea that growth is always achieved by progressives keeps us shouting from either side of the road; it keeps us from meeting somewhere in the middle and moving forward.

Keidane McAlpine could sense Penelope Hocking’s competitiveness from the moment he met her. Although it was still relatively early in his tenure as USC’s women’s soccer head coach, McAlpine was straightforward in the expectations he set for the then-high schooler.
“I just told her flat out … ‘I think you’re going to be an elite forward, I think you’re going to be special,’” McAlpine said. “‘We want you to be our number one, and that’s why we’re recruiting you.’ And I think it resonated with her because … she didn’t want to be just another number. She wanted to come in and carve out [a] space for herself.”
That will and confidence has allowed the sophomore forward to become one of the country’s premier players in a very short time. Despite coming off the bench for most of last season, Hocking led her conference with 14 goals, earning Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and All-Pac-12 second team honors. She followed her impressive freshman year by stepping into the role of starting forward.
Hocking has shouldered the responsibility well, scoring 12 goals and adding five assists this season despite defenses keying in on stopping her. 
“I think it’s harder this year [compared] to year one, [when] you sneak up on people, and they’re not quite ready for you,” McAlpine said. “This year, everybody came into the year saying, ‘We’ve got to stop that kid.’ And so for us, the emergence of her as being able to wear that weight and still produce has been phenomenal.” 
A big reason for Hocking’s success is her fierce approach. Junior forward Tara McKeown, who has partnered with Hocking to form a formidable offensive duo, recalled that Hocking suffered a bad ankle injury against Long Beach State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament last season, but that her competitiveness helped her fight through the pain.
“There was no stopping her from playing in the next game or anything,” McKeown said. “You could tell that there’s so much pain in her, but she didn’t want to let the team down, and she did everything to make the team better and try and get us to go further in the tournament. And that showed in the Florida State game when she scored the only goal we had, and you could tell how much pain she was in, but it wouldn’t show when she was on the field.”
Hocking’s ability and mindset was forged by growing up in an incredibly athletic family. Her father Denny played 13 years in the MLB and her mother Venetta played basketball at Cypress College. But the real competition came with Penelope’s twin sister, Iliana, a sophomore defender at Arizona. This — along with the addition of younger brother Jarrod, also an athlete — made for some intense games growing up.
“Anything we played together, it was kind of just someone had to win,” Penelope said. “And if the other person lost, it was like, ‘Hey, don’t talk to them.’ Like they’re so mad.”
Penelope and Iliana grew up playing on teams together, but the oppositional nature of their positions — and the fact that they were often put on separate teams in practice to make things fair — created clashes all the same.
The two played for the So Cal Blues Soccer Club based in San Juan Capistrano, a long commute from their home in Anaheim. Iliana said she remembers some awkward situations that arose from the drive. 
“Every single practice one of us would be in the car dead quiet, all the time,” she said. “And it’s like a 45-minute drive home in silence, so it was kind of funny.”
McAlpine knew how competitive the sisters get, and he took advantage of their sibling rivalry to motivate Hocking before the Trojans faced the Wildcats earlier this season. He said he told her the defense would be coming after her — trying to get under her skin while also emphasizing that the game was about USC vs. Arizona, not sister vs. sister.
However, McAlpine emphasized that Hocking doesn’t let her competitive nature affect the team in a negative way. Hocking said her father talks to her a lot about how to be a good teammate, drawing on his experiences as a professional athlete.
When the two sisters play now, Hocking said that the softer side of the family clearly shows. Immediate and extended family members always show up for the “Hocking Bowl,” and Penelope said she’s just happy to see Iliana after going months without seeing her.
“It’s nice during season to get the whole family together, because we really never get together with family because we’re all in different places,” she said. “It was nice to have my mom, my dad, my cousins, everyone at the game and having them watch both of us play again.”
Hocking also learned how to be a supportive teammate from USC’s veteran players. Hocking came to USC late her freshman year because she was playing for the United States U-20 National Team in that summer’s World Cup, and she entered the program nervous about how she would fit in. 
However, she was immediately met with a positive, energetic culture. For example, she said senior midfielder Jalen Woodward helped her after a tough game against Utah last year. Hocking had missed on multiple opportunities and was frustrated, feeling she hadn’t helped the team.
“She put her arm around me and just told me that, you know, like ‘We all trust you, we all believe in you,’” Hocking said. “‘You’re fine, you can’t get frustrated and get mad like that. You just need to like keep going.’ Hearing that enforcement, that positive reinforcement from her being an older player just helped me for the next game.”
Hocking said it has been important for her to maintain that positive energy as she ascended as a team leader.
“She understands what it is to be part of a team culture,” McAlpine said. “And as much as she’s hard on herself, she is forgiving of her teammates, even when she’s frustrated with them. You know, in one breath [she’ll] be like, ‘Hey, come on.’ Next breath, ‘You know what, I got you, you know, it’s OK. Let’s keep it going.’”
Hocking has learned to control her fire on the pitch, but that’s never been a problem off of it. She’s majoring in computer science, an area of study that presents a tough workload to take on in addition to the hours required by a Division I sport.
While Penelope has always been a devoted student, Iliana said she didn’t find out about her sister’s interest in computer science until they were in college. McAlpine said Hocking’s prowess on the pitch and in the classroom are connected. 
“It doesn’t surprise me that she’s going to thrive there, too and be great on the academic side, because that’s who she is,” he said. “And she’s going to strive to be No. 1 in whatever she does.”
Hocking’s teammates and coaches alike have picked up on her thoughtful nature. Assistant coach Sammy Towne said she recalls a conversation she had with Hocking about Serena Williams’ argument with a referee at the 2018 U.S. Open.
“It was a really cool moment because she just came in the office, and we sat [and] kind of talked about how Serena handled this situation, and how it was such an incredible moment, I think, for women and women’s sports to really stand up for yourself,” Towne said. “And she is one that she’s going to fight, she’s going to compete, she’s going to stand up for herself.”
USC begins what it hopes will be a long run in the NCAA Tournament with a first round home game against Cal State Fullerton Saturday. To do so, the Trojans will need Hocking to be better than ever. 
Hocking has already won multiple accolades during her first season and will definitely receive more for her efforts this year. She’s already one of the best players in college soccer but, unsurprisingly, Hocking isn’t satisfied just yet.
“I don’t think I’m at my peak yet,” she said. “You know, I think that just motivates me because like, I won an award last year, [and] I wasn’t the best I could be. But now, I can work harder to achieve the next thing and the next thing.”

When Nathan Candaner was a sophomore in the Marshall School of Business, he found searching for internships challenging.
Candaner, now a 24-year-old alumnus, realized that it didn’t need to be so difficult. He could simplify the process and help other students easily find jobs and new opportunities and believed that he could consolidate websites and online job boards with open listings so students are able to better understand the job market. 
This led to the creation of his new company JobzMall in 2018, an interactive online platform with verified job postings where those seeking employment are able to pursue different career opportunities related to government, business, technology, education and other industries.
“Basically, after you use these traditional job boards and you go to ZipRecruiter, you go to Indeed, you type in job listings, you’re greeted with a bunch of texts, so many different job postings,” Candaner said. “You click on one and go to another website, most of them have expired links.                 It’s just a horrible process.”
Sarika Joshi, head of the success division, said JobzMall focuses on making the job search process more humanistic.
“We do work with Fortune 500 companies, we do work with startups, we are working with the education industry like colleges,” Joshi said.
During his time at USC and after graduation, Candaner researched what employers go through during a candidate hiring process and realized they also struggled with finding the right employees. After noticing how many opportunities may be missed on both ends of the job search, he was inspired to create JobzMall. 
Candaner said the company is growing and he hopes the website is able to benefit USC     students who may be confused and stressed about the job search. 
“What we primarily do with our groups, partnerships and all, we have a dedicated person just for colleges, and predominantly in California,” Joshi said. ”We have almost 1,000 organizations out there and 300,000 users … It is essential that users actually know who is hiring, how to connect career options.”
Candaner said he was inspired by his professor Greg Autry, who teaches technology entrepreneurship in the Marshall School. Candaner hopes that his work can inspire other people to find their passions and create their own path.
“Students should believe in themselves,” Candaner said. “I would definitely preach entrepreneurship. One of the reasons why I had the [inspiration] was that I had a great entrepreneurship class.”
Another one of Candaner’s favorite professors was Selahattin Imrohoroglu, who teaches finance and business economics. Imrohoroglu believes that Cardaner’s journey with JobzMall can help other students who also hope to pursue entrepreneurship. 
“He would be a tremendous example [of a] success story to entrepreneurs or who want to be entrepreneurs in [the Marshall School] … I would like to have him talk to my students and kind of tell his story and how it came about. I think this would be a very good connections for Trojans.”
