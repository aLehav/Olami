Daily Trojan sports editor Will Laws interviewed Do Hyoung-Park, the sports editor of the Stanford Daily, earlier this week to give USC fans a better feel for the Cardinal ahead of Saturday’s showdown at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
 
DT: Some thought that the Stanford offense would take a dip this year after the graduation of tailback Stepfan Taylor — but the Cardinal haven’t missed a beat, and have unearthed another gem in Tyler Gaffney. Taylor absolutely ripped USC last year for 213 total yards and two touchdowns. How does Gaffney compare to his predecessor?
SD: Most of us at Stanford thought that the running game — and by extension, the offense — would take a big hit with the graduation of Taylor, too. But Gaffney emerged early as a power back that had the vision and raw physical drive that could give the Card that production again and forced Shaw’s hand to make him the clear number one — after a year off for baseball, no less. I don’t think he’s quite on Taylor’s level — after all, you can’t simply replace a school’s all-time leading rusher and expect there not to be a dip in production — but Gaff has been an absolute workhorse this year. His ability to run downhill and smash for yards after contact has paid off in a huge way for the run game. It also helps that he runs behind Stanford’s monster offensive line.
 
DT: USC’s offensive line isn’t nearly as big as Stanford’s, but it has shown improvement over the past couple weeks. Do you think Stanford can afford to hold off on blitzes and depend on their defensive line to pressure Cody Kessler into mistakes?
SD: Stanford’s defensive line got a huge boost last week when senior defensive end Henry Anderson returned from an injury suffered in Week 3 against Army, and it definitely showed against Oregon, even with Ben Gardner out for the rest of the season. Anderson, Josh Mauro and David Parry are a formidable force up front and even though the depth on the line is a lot shakier than it was at the beginning of the season, all three of them have been making huge plays every game and have consistently brought pressure on quarterbacks. I definitely think that the defensive line can get enough push and we’ve been seeing that in the last few weeks. I really think that this Stanford front seven is one of the best this school has ever seen and that it can get good pressure against any line in the country.
 
DT: For the second straight year, Stanford wrecked Oregon’s hopes for a national championship and now control their own destiny in the race for the Rose Bowl. What’s the mood on campus like right now after last week’s big win? Are the Cardinal faithful taking USC seriously as a potential challenger?
SD: The thing about Stanford is that there’s a significant portion of the campus that is relatively ambivalent about football, so everyday life and mood hasn’t been affected too much. Within the football-aware crowd, though, it seems like everybody is reasonably confident and hopeful for the rest of the season.
That being said, though, a lot of people here are worried about the USC game. The last four Stanford-USC matchups showed that regardless of the differing levels of success of both teams in any given year, the games themselves have been tense nail-biters. None of those games disappointed in terms of matchup value and challenge in any way. Everybody knows that and everybody knows the extent and significance of the rivalry between the two teams, and so I think one would be hard-pressed to find a fan expecting anything less than a close, gritty matchup at the Coliseum on Stanford’s campus. It’s definitely a trap game after the huge Oregon win and a full Coliseum after College GameDay egging on a resurgent USC team that still has Rose Bowl hopes will definitely be a big challenge.
 
DT: In the end, how do you see Saturday’s showdown shaking out?
SD: I think that it’ll be a physical, defensive game dictated by the battle in the trenches as each team tries to establish a running game. I mentioned earlier that a lot of people are really worried about the matchup, but I do think that Stanford’s going to take a lot of confidence into the Coliseum after the Oregon win and I expect Hogan to be able to find receivers open for some big plays in the passing game, especially if it can get a running game going. I think it’ll be relatively close, but I’ll take the Cardinal.
Prediction: 21-10 Stanford

The No. 2-ranked Trojans will host No. 4 Stanford and No. 8 Long Beach State in their final two home games of the season before moving on to postseason play.

While the College GameDay crew features the Trojans vs. Cardinal football contest on the other side of campus on Saturday, the two teams will collide in the pool in a high-stakes matchup that boasts Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament seeding implications.
The Trojans (22-2, 4-1 MPSF) took care of business last weekend in conference play, as they came back to win 11-9 on the road against Cal before coming home and handily defeating Pepperdine 13-3.
The Trojans, however, felt that they could have played better defensively over the weekend.
“We felt like we allowed too many goals against Cal,” said junior driver Kostas Genidounias, who was given the honor of MPSF Player of the Week for the second time. “But we came back and allowed only three against Pepperdine so we will try and continue that against any future opponent.”
Stanford (17-4, 5-1 MPSF) was also very productive last week, notching three wins against UC Irvine (18-6), Chapman (24-7) and Long Beach State (11-8). The Cardinal are currently riding a season-high seven-game winning streak that the Trojans will look to halt on Saturday.
The Cardinal will be looking to avenge their 8-7 overtime defeat to the Trojans in the semifinals of the NorCal Tournament earlier in the season. In fact, USC has won each of the last six matchups between the two teams — but not by much.
Three of the last four games between USC and Stanford have been decided by one goal, and two of them have gone to overtime. Last year, the Trojans defeated the Cardinal 10-9 in overtime at the NorCal Tournament, 9-6 in conference play and 11-10 in the MPSF tournament semifinals.
The team that hails from Palo Alto, Calif., the site of the 2013 NCAA championship, is carried by MPSF leading scorer Bret Bonanni, who is averaging a little more than a hat trick per game. Goalie Drew Holland is currently making just a tad more than 8 saves to 7 goals against him per game.
“Most of our preparation for Stanford will be focused on defense,” Genidounias said.
After taking on Stanford, the Trojans will proceed to play Long Beach State (18-10, 1-5 MPSF) on Sunday. The 49ers had it rough last week, losing to UCLA 9-5 and Stanford 11-8. The Trojans have won 23 consecutive games against Long Beach State after beating them 13-7 at the SoCal tournament.
The 49ers’ leading goal scorer is Zacchary Kappos, who is averaging just under two goals per game. Goalie Pavo Ljepopio has been a force on defense this year, making slightly more than 10 saves per game.
As they near the end of the season, the Trojans know that they can’t take any goal-scoring opportunities for granted.
“Against Pepperdine, we missed a lot of opportunities that we needed to capitalize on,” redshirt junior driver Rex Butler said.
After once again being stripped of its No. 1 ranking after a road loss to the University of the Pacific, the team knows what it has to do in order to be on track for a sixth consecutive national championship.
“We need to win out and do well in the conference tournament,” Genidounias said.
Saturday’s showdown against Stanford is also Senior Day for the Trojans, and the combination of this milestone, Homecoming weekend and a top-five matchup should fill Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 2 p.m. before the schools’ football teams square off in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum three hours later. Sunday’s tilt against Long Beach State is slated for noon.

The USC men’s basketball team hopes to build off the momentum from their home opener, a 95-79 victory over Cal State Northridge, as they prepare to take on Northern Arizona on Friday at 8 p.m.
Fresh face · Walk-on sophomore guard Chass Bryan had his first start of the year for the Trojans in their 95-79 win over Cal State Northridge. – Corey Marquitti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (1-1) bounced back after a 78-65 road loss to Utah State in coach Andy Enfield’s first game with USC and came out with a 95-79 in their home opener against Cal State Northridge on Tuesday. Senior center Omar Oraby led USC with 17 points, while junior forward Byron Wesley finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds and six assists.
USC shot 57 percent from the field as the squad won its home opener for the sixth consecutive year. The two teams combined for 27 turnovers and 48 fouls in the contest.
“It’s hard to be up-tempo if you can’t get steals, can’t get stops,” Enfield said after Tuesday’s game. “If you’re constantly taking the ball out of bounds and the other team makes shots, it really hurts your transition game. Tonight, we were able to do that. We got some key stops and also got some deflections and steals. It always helps when you’re good defensively to do that.”
Oraby said that even though the team showed promise with their offensive barrage against the Matadors, there’s still lots of work to do before USC will face tougher competition in the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament in late November.
“We improved in a lot of things,” senior center Omar Oraby said. “We have to work on rebounding, keeping [opponents] off the offensive boards, and defense.”
Oraby and Wesley have paced USC in scoring by averaging 16 and 15.5 points per game, respectively, over the two contests. Wesley also leads the team with 9.5 rebounds and is second in assists with 5.0 per game, while Oraby has 7.5 rebounds per game. Senior guard J.T. Terrell, the squad’s leading returning scorer from last season who didn’t start against the Lumberjacks for what Enfield called “academic reasons,” is averaging 14.0 points per game.
After scoring 65.7 points per game last year, the Trojans are averaging 80 points in the infancy of their 2013-14 campaign.
“It’s much more up-tempo,” Oraby said. “We’re trying to push the ball as fast as we can. As you can see, we’re scoring more points than we used to last year. It’s based on just pushing the ball and trying to get easy baskets in transition.”
Northern Arizona (1-1) is currently in the middle of a four-game road trip to start the season. The Lumberjacks won their opener 74-63 over UTSA, and are coming off an 88-68 loss to Texas Tech. Forward Max Jacobsen led the team with 15 points and seven rebounds, while guard Quinton Upshur added 14 points.
Last year, the Lumberjacks finished 11-21 and 8-12 in the Big Sky conference, with just a 4-13 record in road games.
“[We’ve been] focusing on their offensive sets, their personnel,” said senior guard J.T. Terrell when asked about practice leading up to the game. “[We’re] focusing on getting better with our rotations and defensive positioning, and working on rebounding.”
USC is 2-0 all-time against Northern Arizona. The last matchup between the two teams was a 60-52 USC win on Dec. 11, 2010.
USC will continue their four-game homestand next week with showdowns against Cal State Fullerton (1-1) on Tuesday at 8 p.m. and West Alabama (1-0) on Thursday at 7 p.m.

For USC redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, the bright lights of Saturday night begin with Sunday mornings. It’s because before football, before USC, Cody Kessler and his parents would go to church every week in Bakersfield, Calif.
In the world of media, Christianity often only appears in extremes, usually “fundamentalists” who constitute the religious right being paired with religiously fueled policy agendas and used as one of the counterpoints in the United States’ constantly bifurcated philosophical discourse. Religion, as the argument goes, is at the heart of so many wars. Yet religion (in Kessler’s case, his Christianity) is seldom credited for being the mightiest sword in every individual’s most important war: the war of a man against himself.
Philippians 4:6 
Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
It’s a warm evening during spring camp in 2013. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek, freshman quarterback Max Browne and Kessler are at the south side of Howard Jones Field doing footwork drills. After Wittek completes his dropback, he launches the ball to a net with three hoop targets. The ball shoots out of his hand with a sharpness that could slice a grain of dust: there’s a reason the word “laser” has become a football cliché for tightly thrown spirals. At least for that moment, you’re convinced it’s because of Max Wittek. His passes are not “passes.” They’re archetypes, projectile extensions of his virility. The ball smashes into the net with enough force to kill a small animal.
Kessler steps up and looks almost feeble and meek in comparison. After the initial stepback, he throws a wobbly spiral into the air. The throw looks almost as tentative as Kessler himself, like Kessler’s arm had politely requested that the ball fall into the target. The pass takes on a parabolic trajectory before it lands neatly in one of the nets.
Practice ends about an hour and a half later, and the press swarm begins. Wittek walks toward the reporters with a smile.
“Bring it on,” Wittek says. And they brought it. It’s 6:15 p.m. during the first spring practice of the year. Max Wittek is USC’s starting quarterback, and if we judge by sight, it’s not even a race.
Down the right side of the press swarm walks No. 6, helmet in hand, toward the exit. His head is up, he’s thinking to himself. No reporters, no notepads, no iPhones. Just a man, his pads and his helmet, thinking about something, maybe talking to Someone.
“I think I was tested the most those first two years. Not being able to start, not being able to play,” Kessler said. “I lean heavily on my faith. I’d talk to my mom and she’d always tell me, ‘Just pray, just pray. God has a plan, everything’s going to take care of itself.”
Isaiah 41:10
Do not fear … for I am your God. I will strengthen you … Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.
You know how the rest of the story goes, and that’s sort of a testament to Kessler himself. But Kessler is no Tim Tebow. You won’t see him kneeling on the sidelines praying after a victory or a loss. Kessler bleeds cardinal like the rest of us. He’s going to have a couple choice expletives on national TV if he throws a pick six. He’s going to yank his chinstrap and get pissed off if he feels like he let his teammates down. But that doesn’t make him any less of a Christian. And being Christian certainly doesn’t make him any less of a man.
Through his coach’s sudden departure, through the installation of the new system under interim head coach Ed Orgeron and offensive coordinator Clay Helton, through a soul-crushing loss to Washington State at home and an unmitigated whipping at the hands of ASU, through constant injuries and shuffling of backfield personnel, Kessler remains. USC’s most uncertain position coming into this season has become the team’s lone constant. And Kessler’s constant has been God.
When asked if he could identify a single point this season where he felt the need to turn to God, Kessler demurred.
“I pray, honestly, all through the season. Some people think of it as, ‘Oh, I’m struggling, I need to pray on the side, something’s not going well so I need to pray,’” Kessler said. “But it’s something that you don’t go to ‘only in the bad times.’ I always try to give Him praise even during the good times.”
This mindset creates a foundation for emotional and physical stability that’s befittingof one of the most demanding and stressful jobs in sports. In his latest book Eleven Rings, 13-time NBA Champion and former coach Phil Jackson said he often cited a Zen phrase to capture the spirit of emotional and physical stability. In order for sustained success, Jackson suggests, it’s not important to merely strive to improve. It’s a matter of sustaining the mindset to constantly strive — to find a motivation beyond simple tangible successes. Jackson described it in his book as, “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”
Psalm 23
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want … Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Cody Kessler is the quarterback of USC’s future. To Kessler, the notion of living for a greater purpose — something beyond football — isn’t just a cheap PR sentiment reserved for press conferences after charity events. It’s part of a greater respect, for someone bigger than himself. For Kessler, that Someone is God.
The Trojans kick off against the Stanford Cardinal at 5 p.m Saturday. ESPN College GameDay will be in town; the game will be nationally televised. The cameras will be on Cody Kessler. And Kessler will look up at the bright lights of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on a crisp Saturday night — and find peace in Sunday morning.

Nice young man a bad a good role model. Cody is what an athlete should be:  someone to look up to and a leader by example.
Great article, so nice to read something positive about Christianity in a student  newspaper.
I’ll second that comment.  Kudos to Euno Lee for a great and respectful article.

With three weeks to go in the regular season, the USC women’s volleyball team doesn’t have the luxury of letting up quite yet. This weekend they will hit the road and travel up to the state of Washington where two hungry Pac-12 opponents will be waiting for them: the unranked-but-dangerous Cougars of Washington State and the conference-leading Washington Huskies.
Efficient · Junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer has converted 114 of her 253 attempts for kills for a .344 hitting percentage this season. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The fourth-ranked Women of Troy (22-3, 12-2 Pac-12) last saw these two foes less than a month ago, and virtually nothing has changed on paper for any of the teams. No. 3 Washington (24-1, 15-1) has gone unbeaten since its victory over USC on Oct. 27 and is currently in the middle of a 12-match winning streak. Washington State (17-11, 3-11) has performed as expected; they have lost four of their past five matches, but the one victory was an impressive sweep over Utah. The only noticeable difference coming into this weekend can be found in the rankings — this time around, the Women of Troy are the ones trailing closely behind the Huskies in the coaches’ poll.
USC senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard, however, knows that there is much more to her team than what can be found on a stat sheet. Though her team is behind in the conference standings and in the rankings, she has seen a big change in the demeanor of the locker room since the four-set loss to the Huskies.
“I think we’re more focused and determined,” Olgard said. “Playoffs are getting closer and closer each game and I know that none of us like the feeling of losing.”
Olgard was unstoppable last time out against Washington, recording 12 kills while recording a .429 hitting percentage. She could have had many more, but the Huskies were able to neutralize USC’s offensive attack by serving tough. USC head coach Mick Haley said the key to beating the third-ranked Huskies is beating their serving game.
“We didn’t make very good volleyball plays last time,” Haley said. “A lot of times, Washington forced us into those plays with their very aggressive serving. Quite honestly, that’s the only thing they do better than us at this point — they bring high velocity six times in a row serving the ball.”
A major problem for USC in their last match against Washington was their inability to get a good pass off of the serve; instead of having three or four options to go to off of a pass they would only have one good look, limiting their offensive potential. With weapons such as Olgard, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio, and freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu, passing will be crucial to USC’s success.
The deck will be stacked even further against the Women of Troy this weekend due to the match’s location. Washington plays very well in their own arena, a facility that regularly hosts around 10,000 fans. The Huskies are unbeaten this season at home and show no signs of slowing.
“They’re always strong in their own gym,” Olgard said. “They’ll have a sold-out crowd, so it’s going to be tough.”
Washington State has not played quite so well at home this season, but they did start the season with eight consecutive home wins. Though the media focus this weekend will certainly be on Friday’s game in Seattle, Haley stresses that Sunday’s matchup in Pullman is nothing to skim over.
“I’m actually as concerned about going to Washington State on Sunday as I am about Washington,” Haley said. “That’s the catch game right there. It’s a smaller venue, it echoes, it’s louder. We can’t just go this weekend to play Washington, we have to play both teams.”
The postseason implications for this weekend are massive. If the Huskies beat the Women of Troy, Washington will be in the driver’s seat for the remainder of the season. If USC wins, however, things could get a little more interesting. A Trojan victory would mean a possible share for the conference title at the end of the season due to the teams’ identical head-to-head record. With tough remaining matches against UCLA, Arizona and upstart Colorado, USC has more than enough motivation to pull out a victory in Seattle.
Several members of the USC squad are eyeing personal milestones as the season comes to a close. Senior All-American libero Natalie Hagglund has already set the USC all-time record in digs and will continue to chase the all-time Pac-12 record. Bricio looks to continue to carry the team offensively as she goes for yet another Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week selection. Already five-time Freshman of the Week Nwanebu has high expectations of her own this weekend.
“I want 22 kills,” Nwanebu said. “It’s my personal record, and I want to beat it.”
Such a performance would likely make Nwanebu the most accomplished Pac-12 freshman in quite some time — her five conference selections have her tied for the most all-time with current teammate Samantha Bricio, who also was named Freshman of the Week five times last season.
But as the team readies to travel north, it’s likely that no player is focused on her own individual achievements with the team’s ultimate goal in reach. The desire is there — all that’s left to do is execute.
Friday’s match against the Huskies will begin at 6 p.m., and Sunday’s match will begin at 1 p.m. in Pullman. Both matches will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.

Back in the early 2000s, a matchup on the gridiron between USC and Stanford usually resulted in an easy victory for the former. The Trojans boasted a 5-1 record with four victories by more than 20 points against their rivals from Palo Alto between 2001-2006. But in 2007, the Cardinal marched into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as 41-point underdogs and knocked off USC 24-23 — and nothing has been the same in the rivalry since.

Stanford has won five of those six games against USC, including the last four contests between the two schools. Two of those victories came when the Trojans were ranked in the top 10.
Now, with the Cardinal ranked No. 5 in the nation and fresh off an upset win against then-No. 2 Oregon, unranked USC is eager to return the favor.
“I know the team’s excited for the challenge,” said senior linebacker Devon Kennard. “I’m really, really excited for this opportunity to play them for my fifth year. They’ve beaten me the last four years.”
To reverse that trend, USC will have to find a way to put points on the board against a vicious defense that held Oregon to 62 rushing yards and is allowing just 99.2 yards per game on the ground, the best mark in the Pac-12. Stanford boasts a disruptive pass rush, too — the Cardinal rank seventh in the nation with 30 sacks, and senior linebacker Trent Murphy ranks third in the nation with 10 of his own.
“It’s gonna be a tough game,” senior right tackle Kevin Graf said. “That just shows how good of a team they are, and how great their defense is.”
Fortunately for the Trojans, they seem to be hitting their stride on offense at just the right time, having racked up 93 total points in their last two victories against Oregon State and California. And even though their running back corps has been depleted with injuries to senior Silas Redd and redshirt sophomore Tre Madden, who are both questionable for Saturday’s showdown, USC seems to have unearthed another speedster from its seemingly endless stable of tailbacks in redshirt sophomore Javorius Allen.
Allen has scored six touchdowns in the past two games, and gained 192 all-purpose yards against Cal on just seven touches. Allen’s breakout has been a pleasant surprise after he was buried on the depth chart under former coach Lane Kiffin.
“[Running backs coach] Tommie [Robinson] saw it in him, and Tommie was always fighting for him,” interim head coach Ed Orgeron said. “His opportunity came and he took advantage of it.”
Allen and the rest of USC’s offense will be facing their toughest opponent yet in the Cardinal, who rank 20th nationally in total defense (348.8 yards allowed per game).
But the Trojans’ defense should prevent a stiff challenge for the Cardinal offense, too — USC actually has a better mark in total defense (17th in the nation, 339.5 yards allowed per game) and is expected to have sophomore defensive tackle Leonard Williams back from a shoulder injury.
If Stanford does succeed in halting USC’s rushing attack, the Trojans will have to rely on the arm of redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler (197.7 passing yards per game) and a passing attack featuring junior receiver Marqise Lee. The reigning Biletnikoff Award winner has just 521 receiving yards this season and has battled several injuries, but declared he was back to full strength at practice earlier this week.
Even with USC facing Stanford at a seemingly ideal time in its schedule, it’s not hard to imagine the Cardinal having their way with a Trojan offense that has struggled to move the ball against the defenses of Notre Dame and Utah.
But the Trojans themselves are confident they have what it takes to halt Stanford’s longest winning streak in the long-standing rivalry between the two schools.
“We still have flaws here and there. But as a team, I think the mindset is there,” Lee said. “[Stanford] is gonna be ready. We just gotta be ready, too.”

Girls in Tech hosted a panel of four “Big Data” enthusiasts Thursday evening in Kaprielian Hall to teach students more about the subject of Big Data and its application in modern technology.

The one-year-old club consists of female students from a variety of majors, who hope to learn more about technology by talking about issues surrounding the role of technology in current events.
“We have members that have backgrounds in gaming and programming, just all sorts of different majors,” said Megan Doyle, secretary of Girls in Tech and a freshman majoring in communication. “We have field trips to go see tech startups, and we’re trying to get a mentorship program going.”
The panel focused on the wide range of fields that Big Data pertains to. It featured prominent engineers Eric Garcia, chief data scientist at Preact, and Robert Leon, vice president of sales and business development at tech company  Gravity.com. In addition, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism adjunct professor Peggy Bustamante and business strategist Barbara Bickham were also on the panel.
Bustamante stressed that though her field may be behind on the Big Data curve, journalism uses Big Data in a different way than most industries.
“We don’t actually use the data for business purposes, it’s for content, journalism and news purposes,” Bustamante said. “The heaviest Big Data that we do is census data.”
USC alumna Reem Mouazzen, who graduated in 2006 with a degree in communication, agreed with Bustamante that her job, though not directly related to Big Data, uses technology to understand customers on a higher level.
“Working in news and media, I started to see how the online news information from consumers relates to the news content we are going to create. The digital media landscape is so important, given that Big Data helps us determine what news stories are relevant to our consumers,” Mouazzen said. “It’s really changing the way consumers are receiving the news and information, and companies are honing their messages to be specific to their customers.”
Students, who ranged from engineering majors to cinema majors, echoed the words of the panel, saying that they saw many ties between Big Data and their individual fields of study.
“I’m really interested in working for a Big Data company. I like business, and I feel like I would be good at organizing data,” said Noble Lau, a senior majoring in business administration. “I feel like the world is going in the direction of technology, that seems to be where all the high-paying jobs are.”
The conversation became heated as the panel and the contributing audience members debated if the use of Big Data can do more harm than good to users.
“Big Data gives insight into existing things that we have lying around. So as long as you have a data log of things people are doing on your website, it’s pretty powerful,” Garcia said. “The NSA wiretapping shocked many people, but as a consumer you should be aware that everything you’re doing is being tracked by someone, somewhere. That’s just the age we live in.”
The panel generally agreed with Garcia’s comment, citing different cases where Big Data had both helped users and caused them to question their privacy.
“Scientifically, Big Data can be used to change lives, but it can also be used incorrectly in harmful ways,” Leon said. “Security is really important, and what you do with the data is really important.”
Bickham said that because of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, people are unconsciously releasing more information than they think. Websites, companies and the government use “cookies” to track and make certain assumptions about consumers from their online presence.
The panel emphasized how Big Data can be used in not only a variety of professions, but also in many different ways.
“The most interesting part of the whole concept of Big Data is the different ways that people are able to use this technology,” Doyle said. “We are basically giving companies access into everything about us.”

On Wednesday, a team of scientists announced that fossil fragments they discovered in Tibet on an expedition begun in 2011 led by Jack Tseng — who was a Ph.D. candidate at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences at the time — were the oldest fossils found of a “big cat” to date.
The fragments, which consist of seven skull fragments from three individual ancient cat specimens, were discovered in a remote location just north of the Himalayan mountains in Tibet. Tseng received his Ph.D. in integrative and evolutionary biology from Dornsife.
A skull from the new species, named Panthera blytheae, was found to be both remarkably large and intact. The new fossils challenge previous notions of how big cats evolved and provide significant clues to the evolutionary chain, according to the scientists involved. It is speculated that the remains are from 4 to 5.95 million years ago. The findings were published in a scientific paper by the Proceedings of the Royal Society. Before these findings, the oldest discovered big cat fossil, which was found in Tanzania, was 3.8 million years old.
Tseng, now a postdoctoral fellow at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said that he has also found other fossils in the same region in past years.
“For me personally, it’s the first discovery that is getting a lot of attention,” he said. “I’ve described fossil species before. For our research team, collectively speaking, this is one of three pretty significant discoveries we’ve already made from this area.”
Tseng’s past discoveries have included ancient ancestors of rhinoceroses as well as findings of three-toed horses. Modern horses are commonly thought to have only one toe or none at all.
Working in the Tibetan autonomous region was not always easy, Tseng said. The region is known for its political conflicts between China’s government and Tibet’s. The archaeological team faced obstacles ranging from being quarantined at military checkpoints to construction blocking roads. Tseng and his team, however, usually tried to travel to the region for a few weeks every summer.
“Some of those years that we did not go was not because we didn’t want to go,” Tseng said. “For example, in 2008, because the Summer Olympics were in Beijing, that year our research permit was denied. They didn’t want a lot of people going to these border regions since they were busy trying to help security with the Olympics.”
One of Tseng’s collaborators was Xiaoming Wang, who holds joint appointments as a professor at USC and a curator at the National History Museum of Los Angeles. The research team also included faculty from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as from the Smithsonian Institution.
Wang noted that Tseng had the to opportunity to study a variety of scientific fields at USC.
“Jack Zheng was from a program that we call Integrative Evolutionary Biology and that program is designed to encourage collaboration between USC and the Natural History Museum, where I work,” Wang said. “So it is extremely gratifying to see that this kind of collaboration bears fruit and have students go through this kind of program so that they get exposed to the best of the university and also to what the Natural History Museum has to offer.”
Many students were excited about Zheng and Wang’s relationship to USC, and what the discovery meant for the university.
“One of the reasons why I came to USC is because we have a lot of Nobel and science prize winners,” said Michelle Zhao, a freshman majoring in health and humanity. “It’s impressive and it’s living up to USC’s reputation.”
Other students were also interested in the scientific aspects of the findings.
“It’s really cool that USC was so involved with such an important discovery. Scientists are always learning more about the evolutionary history of life and new discoveries like this emphasize more than ever how much there is that we still don’t know,” said Sarah French, a freshman majoring in biophysics.

Students enjoy a ride on a USC-themed float as part of the homecoming parade on Thursday afternoon. The parade started at Hahn Plaza and circled around McCarthy Quad and the VonKleinSmid Center.
 
Thus would be a good time for the Daily Trojan to publicise the short documentary “The Game Changer” regarding the USC football team.

More than 50 students and faculty members gathered in Town and Gown Thursday evening to hear Columbia University Professor Mahmood Mamdani discuss the post-apartheid transition in South Africa as part of the Center for Law, History and Culture’s 12th Annual Law and Humanities Distinguished Lecture series.
Mamdani, the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at Columbia University and a leading scholar of African history and politics, human rights and the War on Terror, began the conversation by juxtaposing two responses to historical crimes against humanity: the Nuremberg trials following the allied victory of World War II and Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), the political talks that led to the end of apartheid.
“Nuremberg redefines the problem and the solution,” Mamdani said. “The problem is extreme violence. The solution encapsulated is lessons of Nuremberg is to think of violence as criminal and responsibility for it as individual.”
Recalling one grey morning in Cape Town when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission questioned the seventh and last President of South Africa under apartheid, F.W. de Klerk, Mamdani noted the distinct differences between the TRC, the judicial body established after the abolition of apartheid, and the Nuremberg trials.
“De Klerk had just read out a statement enumerating the wrongs of apartheid, and concluded by taking responsibility for apartheid. But the TRC was not interested,” Mamdani recalled. “At Nuremberg, the greatest responsibility lay with those in positions of power, those who had planned and strategized. At the TRC, the responsibility laid with those who pulled the trigger — those closest to the scene of the crime.”
Further contrasting the Nuremberg trials and the TRC, Mamdani suggested that both responses to human rights abuses differed in how the processes defined “the victim.”
“Whereas Nuremberg shaped the notion of justice as criminal justice, CODESA calls on us to think of justice as a primarily political justice,” Mamdani said. “Whereas Nuremberg has become the basis of what I would call ‘victims” justice,’ CODESA is for an alternative notion of justice which I call ‘survivors” justice.’”
In the case of Nuremberg, Mamdani said the process functioned under the shared political logic by the allies in which the victims and the perpetrators would be physically separated into distinct political communities.
“The possibility of victims’ justice flowed from the assumption that there would be no need for winners and losers to live together after victory,” Mamdani said. “The perpetrators would remain in Germany and the victims would depart for another homeland.”
Though Nuremberg officials had the option of separating victims and perpetrators, CODESA officials did not.
“Whereas Nuremberg was backward looking, preoccupied with justice as punishment, CODESA sought a balance between the past and the future,” Mamdani said. “The very meaning of survivors changed from a victim-based identity to include all those who had survived the apartheid. Yesterday’s victims, yesterday’s perpetrators, yesterday’s beneficiaries and yesterday’s bystanders — all were survivors.”
In closing, Mamdani emphasized the importance of recognizing the lessons of victims’ and survivors’ justice.
“Reconciliation cannot be between perpetrators and victims, it can only be through survivors,” Mamdani said. “The point is not to avenge the dead, but to give the living a second chance.”
Eszter Boldis, a junior majoring in history and philosophy, politics and law, said the lessons from Nuremberg and CODESA can be applicable to contemporary conflicts.
“The concept of justice and learning how to forgive for the survivor’s sake as opposed to seeking vengeance for the victim’s sake was really powerful,” Boldis said. “I think that’s something that the international community can really learn from.”
Some students, however, said there was still much to be desired in terms of defining justice.
“There was a lot left to be said of what his idea of survivors’ justice entails in that it kind of evaded the question of what exactly justice is and what a society is supposed to make of trauma on a collective level,” said Kristen Besinque, a third-year doctorate student in comparative studies.

USC’s Rossier School of Education, ranked No. 17 among graduate schools by U.S. News & World Report, announced Thursday that the school will grant professional support to any alumnus who reaches out.
Beginning on Thursday, the USC Rossier Commitment will provide any alumni with ongoing resources to help them excel in their professional career. Alumni can call the “rapid response team,” which includes a Rossier faculty member who will help create a plan for improvement and guide alumni to resources to help them achieve professional success.
“I am exceedingly proud of the USC Rossier Commitment to stand behind our graduates and their abilities to improve student learning,” Rossier Dean Karen Symms Gallagher told USC News. “I challenge other colleges and universities to join us and take responsibility for the quality of their graduates and America’s teachers. As the country focuses on effective teaching to improve student outcomes, we are doing our part to support our graduates in evolving their practice and being the most impactful teachers they can be.”
A program has been established to administer the USC Rossier Commitment, which includes a hotline and an email that students and alumni can use to contact the school. Gallagher is starting the rapid response team with nine staffers, three of whom are from the teachers education program. These staffers will conduct program diagnosis and plan development. The faculty could even visit the school site to assess graduates’ work. A roster of resources is also available for the graduates.
Gallagher estimated that about 25,000 graduates are eligible for the service, but she didn’t expect an initial flood of calls. Rossier operates a large online program, and about 2,000 students graduate from the school four times a year. Of this number, 1,800 are part of the online program.
Though a press release sent out by USC News referred to the new program as a “groundbreaking pledge,” some experts disagreed about how big the news truly was.
Rick Hess, political scientist and education analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told USA Today that USC’s move was “less a game changer than an admirable and ambitious effort to provide much needed support to new teachers.”
The USC Rossier Commitment will enhance the efforts to evaluate and improve the school’s program, Gallagher said. The school is committed to providing graduates with research-based knowledge and skills to make a difference in the classroom by delivering academically rigorous programs that combine theory and practice.

USC STAND, the Anti-Genocide Coalition, hosted its main event of the semester featuring award-winning photojournalist Sarah Fretwell Thursday night.
Speaking out · Human rights activist and photojournalist Sarah Fretwell spoke about sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. – Jessica Zhou | Daily Trojan
STAND focuses on social issues that occur around the world. The group’s president Francesca Bessey, a junior studying international relations, said the university’s organization focuses specifically on the events happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
STAND is a student-led movement that works across campuses to end genocide. Originally founded to end the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, the organization now fights against all genocides currently happening in the world.
Much of Fretwell’s work shares the same focus and goals as the organization. Her most recent project, “The Truth Told Project,” shares the stories of female rape victims in the North Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo in hopes of raising awareness for women.
“I heard about a news report about a small village in North Kivu that had been held captive for two weeks by rebel troops. And during that time, they systematically raped 200 women and five small girls,” Fretwell said. “I was outraged. I couldn’t fathom how the world had let this happen. How had I let this happen? It was my ‘enough’ moment.”
Fretwell offered the audience historical context, explaining how much of the conflict in the Congo region stems from its wealth of natural resources, specifically its rich minerals, which are used in technology. Her goal of exposing the consequences of using these conflict minerals is also one of STAND’s goals.
“Our chapter is currently affiliated with the Conflict-Free Campus Initiative, an international movement to engage colleges and universities in taking a strong stance against the conflict minerals trade which is financing the violence in the Congo,” Bessey said.
Fretwell discussed her determination to expose the horrors happening to the young girls and women of North Kivu through her project.
“As my plane hit the red dirt runway, the conditions [in the Congo] were so bad that one woman was raped every minute,” Fretwell said. “On a human level, I struggled to understand why it was all happening, but what I did know is that my happiness was inextricably linked to those girls and women and their ability to seek justice.”
The stories and interviews Fretwell shared left a lasting impact on many of the audience members.
“I thought the presentation was extremely impactful. The photos that Sarah took are just absolutely profound; they make an impact on just about anybody’s heart,” said Michael Tong, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “Just the way the expressions on their faces with their words over it really is going to impact the world and bring mass education to a very important subject that kids in college and just people in general don’t know about.”
Several audience members said they attended the talk in an effort to learn more about events that are not always reported in American media.
“As a USC student, I’m stuck in this USC bubble, so any opportunity to learn about how there is so much atrocity and so many terrible things out there, [or] to just get informed and do something about it and to support a group who is actually doing something about it,” said Claire Logan, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Fretwell said getting the word out about the human rights violations happening in the Congo is her ultimate goal.
“The most important thing is that these stories have reached thousands of people around the world,” she said. “And that’s the reason the project is succeeding. It’s driving influence is that it’s not about me, it’s about helping them seek out the opportunity to seek justice.”

ESPN Radio and TV personality Colin Cowherd came to the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Thursday evening to kick off USC Homecoming Weekend with a discussion led by Dan Durbin, director of the Annenberg Institute for Sports, Media & Society.
Cowherd flashed a “fight on” sign to the audience before he and Durbin dove into a conversation on Cowherd’s experience as the primary morning anchor of ESPN for the past 10 years.
Cowherd is the host of The Herd With Colin Cowherd, a syndicated talk radio show that broadcasts weekdays 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on ESPN Radio and ESPNU. He also debuted Colin’s New Football Show, which broadcasts Sunday mornings on ESPN2, in early September of this year. Cowherd recently wrote his first book, You Herd Me! I’ll Say It, If Nobody Else Will, which was available for presale and signing after the talk. Cowherd also announced that he found out Wednesday that his book would make The New York Times best-seller list.
Cowherd captured the audience’s attention with loud gestures and captivating stories, beginning with some insight into how he came to be the professional he is today.
“I always knew what I wanted to do and I always had a strong opinion. My mom used to say I was eight going on 42,” Cowherd said. “I couldn’t wait to get the newspaper everyday … I was just fascinated by it. I would mostly go to the sports section and my mom would always say, ‘You have to read more than the sports section.’ I told her ‘No, I don’t, I’m going to make a living in sports.’”
Cowherd attributed much of his success to constantly listening to the radio and practicing his own commentary. He said, however, that the best piece of advice he got was when his mother encouraged him to take a job opportunity covering baseball in Las Vegas and leave college at the age of 18.
“Well, darling, you have always had dreams, you have to pursue your dreams in life, you can go back and get a degree, so I think you should go,” Cowherd said in an impersonation of his mother.
Not surprisingly, that was not the only impersonation Cowherd, who is known for his confident radio personality and colorful commentary, performed.
While doing an impression of  Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, Cowherd admitted Scully is someone he looks up to.
“Vin Scully is why I work so hard,” Cowherd said. “He is just the best ever and there is no one like him. He just has incredible timing.”
Cowherd’s comedic leanings could play more into his show in the near future.
“I’m not going to give it away, but in the next six months there is going to be an opportunity for me and I will be hiring Saturday Night Live writers,” he said. “I am a big believer, and I think there is a real gap and opportunity for a mesh of a Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert meets sports.”
Cowherd also gave a lot of advice throughout the discussion, some of which might have been surprising to the audience.
“I like to be wrong occasionally,” he said. “Sometimes I egregiously just whiff completely and the audience just destroys you but people love you for it when you admit to it.”
Cowherd said that some of his worst qualities on the show are his impatience, his need to have a strong opinion and his loudness.
Many of the students who came and watched him speak, however, said they admired Cowherd for those exact qualities.
“Colin Cowherd is the type of guy who has an opinion, he’s not giving you the same cookie-cutter answers every time you do something and that’s why you can see how hard he works,” said Imran Noorali, a senior majoring in business administration.
Cowherd admitted that he sometimes plays up his opinion on his show to make the broadcast more interesting. Cowherd fills a three-hour time slot every weekday, which he equated to 35 columns per day, 175 per week and 600 per month.
One of the key aspects of his show is having discussions with different guests, both sports-affiliated and not, that often erupt into heated rants and disagreements.
“I think authentic dialogue and conflict is really good, and I am a big believer in that. It’s good to argue with your wife, it’s good to argue with your friends, it’s good to argue with your audience,” Cowherd said. “Don’t be mean — but it’s healthy.”
Caroline Deisley, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said she admires Cowherd but finds it difficult to see the current role of women in the industry. Cowherd himself admitted that men make up the majority of his audience.
“I found it very interesting to hear what he had to say about women because something I really struggle with is how women are portrayed in the sports media,” Deisley said. “I hate that they are portrayed as being there for the male gaze, that they are always attractive and they are always the sideline reporters.”
Ultimately, students said Cowherd’s genuine personality and charisma helped them gain insight into a field they hoped to enter.
“One hundred percent what I heard and what I learned played into my studies,” Deisley said. “He gave life advice, he is a professional who has succeeded in it and it’s something that I want to do and he provided me with inspiration go out and do what I wanted but also reminded me of stuff that I need to remember as I go out into the field.”
Cowherd said one thing he likes about sports is how it they have the power to bring people together.
“With sports there is a connective tissue. Everybody likes sports, they know someone who plays sports, it all kind of connects. It’s not as angry as politics,” he joked.
Cowherd will be returning to USC on Friday to broadcast his morning talk show live from Pardee Plaza.

If Waka Flocka Flame tells you that you better “turn your a– up,” you do it — and you don’t ask questions. And that’s exactly what he wants tonight at the Shrine Expo Hall — for everyone to turn it up.
Squad up · Rapper Waka Flocka Flame is enjoying significant success following the release of his debut, Flockaveli. The Georgia-based rapper has also become well known for his wild, energetic live performances. – Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records
Flocka will provide support for one of DJ Magazine’s top 10 DJs in the world, none other than Steve Aoki. Basically, it’ll be one giant party. If you’ve scored tickets, be prepared for some possible cake in the face, and some definite “going hard in the paint.” Both will perform in Los Angeles on Friday for a homecoming show that surely won’t disappoint. They will also perform with Australian rap star Iggy Azalea, DJ Alvin Risk and up-and-coming trap trio Keys N Krates.
Friday’s show is just one stop on the Dim Mak founder and international producer/DJ’s “Aokify America” tour, which began on Oct. 30. The tour will span 13 states as well as two provinces of Canada, and will also feature bass DJ Borgore and two appearances from producer Pharrell Williams.
“Aokify America” blends trap, dubstep, hip-hop and EDM in a wild show that spans all definitions of “turn up.” Flocka told the Daily Trojan that he joined the DJ on his tour because he feels that “Steve is like the Waka Flocka of house music and electronic music,” and thus they make a good team.
Aoki was nominated for a 2013 Grammy for Best EDM Album, founded an independent record label and averages about 250 shows per year. His latest tracks include “Boneless,” which has debuted at number 10 dance track on iTunes, “Bring You To Life” with house producer Rune RK and a collaboration with Linkin Park for “A Light That Never Comes.”
Meanwhile, Waka Flocka Flame dropped his latest mixtape, From Roaches to Rolex, a free, 15-track release of bangers that might foreshadow what will come early next year with his new album, Flockaveli 2.
“I wanted to do a hardcore underground hip-hop CD. I wasn’t looking for beats, I wasn’t looking for singles or any old records,” Flocka said. “[The album will] be one of the most anticipated albums, and I doubt any other music sounds like this. Expect high intensity — that feel good music, that party music, that put-you-in-the-zone music, that in-the-gym-working-out music, that 12 o’clock, 12:30, 1 a.m. music. It’s just that feel-good music.”
Though Flocka seems like an unlikely companion for a Steve Aoki tour, the rapper has never been shy of branching out.
“It’s the best tour I’ve ever been on in my life, I love it,” Flocka said. “Steve is like the Waka Flocka of house music and electronic music. I felt like this is something nobody ever did before,” Flocka said. “I hate being a follower; I love leading, so I love doing new things and new events because I want people to follow the path that we create, instead of following a path that another man created.”
Keys N Krates, an upcoming live band from Canada, will also join Aoki on Friday. They describe themselves as a hip-hop and electronic blend, though many just categorize the band as live trap. Dim Mak released their Solow EP in September, and their banger “Treat Me Right” has topped charts. The trio has also performed at huge music festivals such as Lollapalooza and Ultra Music Festival.
Borgore, the final artist in the unsual threesome on tour, also recently released his bass-heavy “Wild Out” EP and will be performing several of his hits. These include “Booty Monsta,” “Wayak” and the lead single, “Wild Out,” which has headlined Beatport and Soundcloud in the past month.
Borgore collaborated with Flocka on the EP and the duo recently answered questions regarding the release on Reddit. Though Borgore will not join the other two artists on Friday, he will return to Los Angeles on New Year’s Eve to perform at the Hollywood Palladium. For now, Flocka can’t wait to perform tonight at the Shrine.
“This is the show-off state, you gotta show off a lot,” Flocka said. “I can’t wait to get there, man.”

It’s difficult to begin the sequel of a book when the high expectations from the first novel are still in the back of your mind. And The New York Times best-selling author J.A. Redmerski’s The Edge of Always proves that sometimes it’s often better for readers to abandon any expectations at all, since they usually lead to disappointment.
Losing its Edge · Redmerski’s second novel follows 20-year-old Camryn Bennett as tragedy befalls her relationship with her fiancee. – Photo courtesy of Grand Central Publishing | Daily Trojan
In The Edge of Always, the sequel to her best-selling novel The Edge of Never, Camryn Bennett and Andrew Parrish pick up right where they left off in the first novel. After dropping out of college, Camryn is now pregnant. Tragedy strikes the two characters, and they decide to go back on the road and sing for money, hoping to live out each moment as if it is their last. And these might very well be their last moments. Camryn is reluctant to let go of the pain she feels over Andrew’s health problems, and Andrew hopes the roadtrip will help them discover what’s next for them, what’s home and what feels right.
The difference between this novel and the previous installment of the series, however, is that the readers feel less of an emotional connection to characters. Redmerski’s sequel to The Edge of Never is missing the development of the first novel. The reader ends up seeing the same characters dealing with the same problems with no character growth or justifiable plot twist whatsoever.
Just as in the first novel, Redmerski tells the story from both points of view, which worked to  her advantage. Ever since her debut fantasy series Mayfair Moon, Redmerski proved she knew how to create interesting characters. In The Edge of Always, Redmerski manages to provide adequate insight into the minds of both protagonists without being redundant.
Though deeper character development was not achieved in the sequel, the dialogue between Cameryn and Andrew was one of the highlights of the novel. Fresh and realistic, it’s obvious Redmerski had fun creating scenes between her characters, and it’s comforting to see the characters retain the same charm from the first novel.  Uncomfortably, however, Redmerski fails to provide new ideas about the characters.
Therefore, the reader is left disappointed because they cannot achieve the same emotional connection to the material that was forged in the first novel of the series.
The Edge of Always also includes flashbacks from the first novel, which are bittersweet to read. The Edge of Never told an interesting story about two strangers who developed a love for each other with layers of well-connected conflict and character dynamics. The Edge of Always made up a reason for Andrew and Camryn to go on the road again and takes the reader through the same journey as the first novel, only this time there is no conflict or new development in the protagonists’ relationship. The journey, which is essentially the premise of the book, is almost unnecessary. Flashbacks from the first novel, while sometimes interesting to read, only remind the reader how frustrating it is that the sequel does not live up to the original.
This brings up the question of whether the book should have been written at all. Sequels are often hinted at in the end of the first novel by the inclusion of either a cliffhanger or uncertainty in the plot. Though Redmerski attempted the latter, The Edge of Always didn’t have quite the “happy ending” effect that the first did. Camryn and Andrew got their “happily ever after” in the first novel. They really didn’t need another.

As the year draws to a close, the film industry begins to gear up for the madness of awards season. The films that studios believe to be their best chances at Academy Award gold will be strategically released in these last couple of months to keep them fresh in the minds of voters. It is unfortunate that awards can be greatly influenced by one film’s publicists outmaneuvering those of a different film. These awards should be based on the quality of the films, not on the quality of a PR campaign. This, unfortunately, is not the case.
Perhaps the most notable form of this maneuvering is the now famous — or perhaps infamous — “for your consideration” campaign, examples of which will soon fill the trade papers and spill out into newspapers and websites. The most famous instance of this was 1998’s advertising battle between Miramax’s Shakespeare in Love and Dreamworks’ Saving Private Ryan. Miramax’s flick managed to garner quite a bit of attention through its sheer volume and Shakespeare in Love eventually won the Oscar for Best Picture. Miramax’s advertising campaign for the star-studded film was rumored to cost $15 million for the Academy Award consideration campaign alone.
The practice has been around since the ’30s, or nearly as long as the Oscars have been in existence, albeit in a less pervasive degree. Now, however, many films will plaster their consideration ads without any restraint, not fearing the saturation that brought on such heavy criticism 15 years ago for Shakespeare because, frankly, everyone else is doing it, too.
What emerges here is a sort of advertising arms race, where any studio that doesn’t keep up runs the risk of their film falling into obscurity. Though tact used to be the name of the game, it is now a game of escalation, and no studio wants to be left behind. Subtlety has been thrown out the window, replaced by the attempt to garner the most favor with awards selection committees by having the greatest possible exposure.
The trade ads are coming very soon, but currently the maneuvering is more subtle. In comparison, Hayao Miyazaki’s last film The Wind Rises was just shown at the American Film Institute Festival for a week, even though its actual release date isn’t until February so that it qualifies for this year’s animated feature award. Martin Scorsese’s upcoming The Wolf of Wall Street was due to be released this weekend but the editing process took longer than expected. There was a frenzy in some corners as the film had been generating a good amount of awards buzz and if it got pushed past the end of 2013, it would have to wait through all of 2014 for eligibility for next year’s Oscars. Ultimately, Paramount pushed the film they intended to release on Christmas, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, until 2014 and put Wolf in its spot, avoiding the awards debacle.
When a film’s release is handled less expertly, the results can be quite embarrassing. The Palme d’Or-winning Blue is the Warmest Color was snubbed by the Academy Awards committee. The reason for this is not a controversial decision by the French selection committee to nominate a different film, but rather the film being released after the cutoff for the foreign film Oscar. By virtue of already having been released in the United States, however, it is eligible for all other Oscars in the awards ceremony and it could conceivably win an Oscar such as Best Adapted Screenplay and then win Best Foreign Film 12 months later. Some experts argue that winning at this year’s Oscars would disqualify it from winning the foreign film award a year later, but this situation has never arisen before, so no rule explicitly outlaws it. Considering the controversy with Blue, this is certainly not the biggest talking point surrounding the film. But a film of this quality being disqualified from the foreign film category because of a simple oversight such as this is very unfortunate.
The reality is these maneuverings are a very real and very essential part of the modern awards season. One can only hope that the films of the best quality also snag the most savvy publicists and the smartest marketers, in order to have campaigns and strategies that allow them to receive the recognition they deserve.

Each fall marks a drastic change for the film industry, a movement away from a summer inundated with action and effects-heavy blockbusters to a much more intimate awards season throughout the winter. To mark this transition is the crescendo of the film festival schedule, culminating in nearby Hollywood with the AFI Fest. On any given year, this three-month span is hectic, but often the industry’s most shining moment. This festival season, in particular, is perhaps the strongest in recent memory.

Though audiences are lucky to view a handful of award-worthy films most years, this fall’s and winter’s offerings, based on an overwhelmingly positive critical response, seem to push that count upwards of 10 or 15. As a result, AFI Fest, an event already famed for its trademark glamorization of Hollywood, was escalated to the nth degree. The film festival already prides itself on screening only the ‘creme de la creme’ of the cinematic year, and AFI Fest 2013 featured a nearly unprecedented eight gala premieres, which headlined an equally prestigious full schedule.
This year’s festival began with the North American premiere of Saving Mr. Banks, a love letter to Hollywood from Walt Disney Pictures, dramatizing author P.L. Travers’ resistance to a cinematic adaption of her popular children’s book, Mary Poppins. Starring Tom Hanks as the legendary Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as the begrudging Travers, the John Lee Hancock-directed drama possesses a special connection to its AFI Fest venue. The TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly known as the Grauman’s Chinese Theatre) housed the premiere of Mary Poppins nearly 50 years prior and with its screening in the same theater, Saving Mr. Banks completes an unprecedented cinematic journey for the practically perfect nanny. The journey was acknowledged by AFI with a special restored showing of the classic Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke musical over the weekend.
Though AFI Fest is known for its aggrandizement of Hollywood — with the opening night anchored by Saving Mr. Banks certainly perpetuating that tradition — the remainder of the festival couldn’t have been a more diverse, eclectic presentation of the cinematic year’s excellence. Other galas included The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, the Ben Stiller dramedy based on the perennial James Thurber short story of the same title, and Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coen Brothers’ latest work fictionalizing the Manhattan folk music scene during the 1960s. These two films depict the festival’s desire to not only showcase glamorous works, but also pieces that tackle varying, untraditional themes.
Of course, the gala premieres only comprise a very small portion of the festival, the full slate of which is made up of nearly 120 films (83 feature length) from more than 40 countries. Some highlights include Spike Jonze’s Her, a masterpiece meditation on love, what it means to be human and the future of society’s relationship with technology. This romance stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a socially inept writer who falls in love with his Siri-like operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. The film drew incredible praise following its Wednesday night screening at the Egyptian Theatre after which Jonze thanked the audience with an extended Q&A session. Hayao Miyazaki’s last film, The Wind Rises, and the Cannes Jury Prize winner from Japan, Like Father, Like Son, both screened as part of the festival’s World Cinema section.
But the main highlight of the fest was AFI Fest’s recognition of Oscar-nominated director David O. Russell in a special tribute at the historic Egyptian Theatre. In an almost two-hour discussion about his filmography, his career thus far and his influences, AFI honored Russell with its grandest accolade, a favor he returned by screening footage from his newest work.
Though not the most recognizable name in Hollywood, at least to the mainstream public, Russell has cemented his place as one of the industry’s most unique and honest filmmakers. For the early portion of his career, Russell had been highly successful in the independent realm, though he had not reached the caliber he is operating at today.
Russell took a six-year hiatus after directing his self-proclaimed weakest film, I Heart Huckabees, but eventually made a triumphant return to cinema with The Fighter. And it was this boxing drama, an adaptation of the true underdog story of Boston’s Micky Ward, which changed everything for Russell, winning seven Academy Award nominations. Reflecting on his career, Russell said that with The Fighter, he finally discovered the “type of movie he wanted to make.” It was not only a turning point within himself, but also one for his perception among his peers and audiences.
Upon completing the even more successful Silver Linings Playbook, a recipient of eight Oscar nods, Russell was no longer a merely talented filmmaker — he was now a member of Hollywood elite. And to conclude Russell’s pseudo-trilogy of brilliant cinema is this winter’s American Hustle. Though it has yet to premiere, it’s already generating buzz for film of the year in the minds of many critics and industry professionals. Not only does it feature Russell in a rare, almost untouchable form, but it is also set to showcase performances from Hollywood’s most prestigious actors (Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Robert de Niro and Jeremy Renner). The story involves the true life events of a con man working with an FBI agent during the late ’70s and early ’80s.
When speaking about the film during the tribute, there was a sense among Russell and his colleagues that they had created something special; that despite many accolades with his last two films, 2014 will be the year that Russell finally breaks through and sweeps the awards circuit. Based on the highly successful trailers and the opening six minutes, which Russell revealed publicly at the AFI Fest tribute, American Hustle looks like a triumph. The opening sequence is a distinctly period film, yet features an electricity and an honest heart that Russell has learned to master. It is an excellent establishment of character in which Russell takes the actor almost all moviegoers associated with Batman, Bale, and deconstructs his persona into an entirely different entity.
Despite not holding a premiere or screening at the festival, Russell made his presence known at AFI Fest. With a candid conversation and screening of the first American Hustle footage, he reaffirmed his position in this year’s awards race. Though the first months of fall have been particularly strong in terms of praiseworthy films, this cinematic year is Russell’s for the taking.
It can certainly be said that AFI Fest saves the “best for last,” being that it is the final major film festival of the year. The 2013 offering was the perfect ending to an incredible season of filmmaking and a promising prelude to what should be a very exciting awards competition.

Films this year have been full of striking visual films. Reaching into space, dystopian futures and comic book universes, audiences have had a lot of spectacle thrown their way. Alexander Payne’s Nebraska might just be the polar opposite of that spectacle. Yet, it is a different kind of delicious.
Pot of gold · Bruce Dern plays Woody, a grumbling man who believes he has won a million dollars through the lottery. Nebraska follows his journey from his home in Montana to Lincoln, Neb. to claim a non-existent “prize.” – Photo courtesy of Paramount Vantage
 
Set in the plains of Montana, Wyoming and, yes, Nebraska, the film follows the journey of Woody Grant, played by Bruce Dern, and his son David, played by Will Forte, to collect the $1 million Woody believes he has won in a contest. The contest is actually a mail scam and essentially everyone in the film knows this other than Woody. He refuses to believe that and attempts to walk the 815 miles from his home in Billings, Mont. to the address where he can presumably collect the money in Lincoln, Neb. Eventually David gets fed up and decides to humor him and drive him to Nebraska. Their journey is a rocky one, although the conflict never reaches feverish heights.
At the center of it all is Bruce Dern. He is fantastic in his role of Woody, playing the mostly deaf, mostly oblivious, cranky old man with a brilliantly subdued comedic pulse. His timing is flawless and he carries the film with equal skill to moments of both hilarity and of heartbreak. Will Forte, of Saturday Night Live fame, manages to play an excellent straight man to Dern’s quirky antics, showing off dramatic acting chops previously unseen in MacGruber and 30 Rock. The interactions he creates with Dern are quite fascinating and the way they play their characters’ evolving relationship is beautifully executed. Every gag is delicate, hinging on silence as much as the words actually being said.
June Squibb, who plays Woody’s wife Kate, steals many of her scenes with a dynamite performance. Her irreverent banter about Woody’s past life and all the sexual advances she had to fend off from other guys in town must be some of the most hilariously inappropriate words ever uttered on camera. It’s a wonderful counterbalance to the subdued comedy that the rest of the cast brings. Bob Odenkirk, fresh off his immensely popular role as Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad, and Stacy Keach, a captivating character actor, both give performances that are more highlights among this very deep and talented cast.
The film is a series of dichotomies: a comedy and a drama, a road trip adventure and an examination of family, a whimsical flick with a dark edge. The story is amazingly simple, but mined for every nugget of gold it can offer. The payload is surprisingly rich, even from a film that brings very hyped expectations with it.
That silence, that subdued quality that the majority of the cast takes advantage of to make their comedy resonate even more, permeates the rest of the film as well. The open emptiness of the states through which Woody and David travel offers a sense of quiet that most films cannot reach. The music rarely strays from one often-repeated background song and Nebraska is filmed in black and white. Compared to a film such as Gravity, Nebraska is almost a sensory deprivation experiment.
One downside to the flick is its pace: Nebraska is very slow. But a film that focuses as much on silence and on the lives of septuagenarians is bound to hold a slower pace. And if someone is not fully focused on the action, they run the risk of getting very bored and losing interest. Suffice it to say, this film is not sympathetic to the viewer with a short attention span. Yet that shouldn’t deter someone from catching this movie. It’s easily one of the funniest films of the year, that at the same time packs a serious emotional punch.
It will certainly be interesting to see Nebraska competing with the other awards contenders this year, as it offers a very different sort of viewing experience than Gravity or 12 Years a Slave. Those films strove to immerse the audience with orchestral grandeur and elicit emotions from the powerful connection that they formed. This film is no orchestra; it’s more like a blues solo, simple and minimalistic. Gravity is a film that you have to see in theaters to fully appreciate its majesty. Nebraska is the same way; you should see it in theaters, but for the exact opposite reason: watching it out of the immersive experience of a movie runs the risk of missing out on some of the film’s most subtly brilliant notes. And this beautifully crafted film certainly deserves better.

With winds 3.5 times as strong as Hurricane Katrina, Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines on Nov. 8, ravaging homes and decimating lands. Nearly 11 million Filipinos were affected by this tragedy, according to the Economist.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
Many organizations, such as World Vision, have harnessed the power of social media to spread awareness of the tragedy and encourage donations to the cause. But real relief does not come in the form of Facebook statuses or tweets — after all, the aid rallied by a few individuals can only go so far. Real relief depends on the actions of the international community.
CNN reported that aid from the United States to the Philippines is at an “unprecedented level.” American aircraft carriers have played a crucial role in assisting displaced people, supplying food and medical care.
But countries such as China are so focused on international politics that they choose to disregard the suffering of thousands. Such actions are simply unacceptable.
China, for example, initially donated a mere $100,000. One hundred thousand dollars is pocket change for the world’s second largest economy. After drawing fire from the international community, China announced it would increase this meager number to $1.64 million.
The New York Times reported that China’s petty donation can be attributed to its sour relationship with the Philippines. In contrast to its offer of a measly $100,000, China pledged $1.5 million to Pakistan during its earthquake in September.
When it comes to humanitarian relief, countries cannot act based solely on their own state’s interests.
Ultimately, people are people and politics must be set aside to end adversity.
Nations such as Taiwan understand this philosophy. According to Time, “In May, a Taiwanese fisherman was killed by the Philippine Coast Guard in the South China Sea.” But Taiwan still sent $200,000 in aid, which is twice the amount of China’s paltry offer.
Starving and homeless families deserve help, regardless of their nationality. The effects of Haiyan necessitate the same multilateral effort seen during the 2004 earthquake that devastated southeast Asia. Even Pakistan, which has had bitter relations with India, offered its help during that time of great distress.
CNN described the sheer havoc that has unfolded in the Philippines best: “The bloated corpses of dogs lie next to body bags filled with human remains. The stench from wreckage hovers all around, as people sift through debris. A line snakes around of the airport, filled with those eager to leave. Families huddle inside the city convention center, savoring their first rice in a week but not knowing when their next meal will come.”
As the Philippines embarks on a long journey to recovery, it desperately needs as many helping hands as it can get. And as effective as social media campaigns can be, it is important to pressure governments to play their part.

On Nov. 8, Carmen Carrera, a transgender woman, announced her interest in walking the Victoria’s Secret catwalk. Carrera, known for her appearances in RuPaul’s Drag Race, would be the first transgender female to walk the annual Victoria’s Secret show, an event viewed by millions on CBS and mostly catered to heterosexual men. Upon her expression of interest in walking, NewNowNext reported that some have criticized Carrera’s dreams because she would alter the “ideal” image of a Victoria’s Secret angel. But in reality, Carrera would tear down gender barriers and benefit society.
Carmen Carrera, born Christopher Roman, first rose to fame as a contestant on RuPaul’s Drag Race, a reality television show designed to mirror America’s Next Top Model. She was eventually eliminated before the finale, but Carrera left a positive impression upon her audience. After her stint on the show, Carrera’s modeling career skyrocketed. According to the Daily Beast, Carrera has appeared in W Magazine twice and walked in Marco Marco’s show for Los Angeles Fashion Week. Now, Carrera is regarded as one of the fashion industry’s first transgender supermodels. Carrera certainly has the experience to walk the Victoria’s Secret runway.
The fact that Carrera has such a strong background in modeling highlights just one of the many reasons why she would be a worthy candidate to be a Victoria’s Secret Angel. First, most of the fashion industry’s representatives are rail-thin women who act as closet hangers to a designer’s creations. Anybody who diverts from the standard attracts attention. Recently, a surge of plus-sized models have been noticed in the industry, but institutions of image cannot just stop at size. Gender, and what is expected of each gender, is socially constructed and therefore cannot be definitive. Society might frown upon men who want to become women, but nothing, except societal pressure, is stopping people from becoming comfortable with who they are. Carrera sends a message to the public to celebrate their inner selves and achieve those aspirations.
Though Carrera’s message is inspiring, many have expressed polarizing opinions over the matter. One of top comments in response to the Carrera story criticized Victoria’s Secret for noticing people based on merit, should they choose to put Carrera in the show, according to the Daily Beast. They recognized Carrera as a revolutionary agent, but being radical doesn’t equate with being qualified. Though this is a valid argument, Carrera’s involvement with high fashion and walking previous runways bolsters her ability to be a Victoria’s Secret Angel. The only thing stopping her is how she was born into the “wrong” sex, a mentality with which much of society is still uncomfortable.
To combat this antiquated mindset, the public must be exposed to people who eradicate gender stereotypes. Putting Carmen Carrera on the Victoria’s Secret runway is just one step. So far, Carrera has found support among her fans. Almost immediately after Carrera’s announcement, Change.org posted a petition to raise awareness of Carrera’s situation. So far, the petition has garnered nearly 40,000 signatures.
Carrera’s story has highlighted that whether a person is XX or XY or XX formerly XY, no boundaries are permanent.

While Angelenos were complaining about the unseasonably hot weather on Wednesday, 16-year-old Hussein Ghwadreh of Palestine stabbed 19-year-old Israeli soldier Eden Atias to death in Northern Israel.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Ghwadreh stabbed Atias several times on a bus driving from Nazareth to Tel Aviv. Police have told several news outlets that Ghwardreh claimed revenge for some of his family members held in Israeli jails as his motivation for killing the recently conscripted soldier.
In a region torn by decades of fighting, one instance of violence rarely stands out. Atias’ killing should not become absorbed in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, but rather serve as a reminder of exactly what is at stake in the Middle East.
Atias’ death sparked such a reaction in the international media not because it was rare, but because of the teenagers’ youth. Though many in the United States can often write off these tragedies as symbolic of the crisis, a 16-year-old feeling the urge to kill another teenager should not be seen as normal, even in a restless nation.
The United States has become used to its role as a sort of “world police,” intervening here and there when it sees a global humanitarian crisis. And yet, American society has grown so accustomed to the decades of violence between Israelis and Palestinians that we barely notice the death toll.
The United Nations Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East estimated that 711,000 Palestinian refugees were initially displaced when Israel was founded in 1948. The agency estimates that those refugees’ descendants number close to 4,950,000. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that at least 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians have been killed in the conflict between 1948 and 1997. Other approximations give even higher numbers of casualties.
With plans to build more permanent housing for Israelis in the contested West Bank on the horizon, the conflict is far from over. Palestinian negotiators recently resigned from their jobs, noting the lack of progress towards a peaceful resolution. As the fighting and violence continues, peace can seem further and further away.
It is tempting for Americans thousands of miles away from Gaza or the West Bank to write off the crisis. The relationship between Israel and Palestine is deeply rooted in historic, cultural and religious motivations as well as the more obvious political problems, and can appear unsolvable. Citizens outside of the region can lose interest in a conflict that seems never-ending or impossible to solve.
Many times, a lack of cultural understanding leads to the inability to care about the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Few understand the historical background of the region or have more than a passing awareness of the differences between the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Palestinian National Authority or the Gaza Strip. The mainstream media largely ignores the religious or cultural differences between the factions, instead focusing on their international political implications.
And though the politics of the region of course constitute an important part of the conflict and the peace process, there is more to the Israeli-Palestinian story — the people.
Though the average American’s life experience likely differs greatly from the average Israeli’s or Palestinian’s, neither side can forget their similarities. Even the most sheltered, suburban American can empathize with how it must feel to fear for your safety on a daily basis. From a humanitarian standpoint, the conflict between Israel and Palestine has been one of the most consistently devastating crises of the 20th and 21st centuries.
When a 19-year-old is stabbed to death by a 16-year-old, the world should not view this killing as yet another act of violence or something that is to be expected in a region fraught with conflict. The international media, governments and citizens from every country in the world should see it as a tragedy, and another reminder of the need for a peaceful settlement. Atias’ death must not be perceived as just another casualty in an ongoing conflict, but a loss of a life on the world stage.

And to the “part-Palestinian” who posted above: “I don’t agree with adolf hitler, BUT…”
Anyone who ever speaks these words will get what’s coming to them. That you would Explicity state that you wish the Jews had been wiped off the Earth betrays your hatred and madness. You don’t know what you’re speaking about. You don’t know the level of Satanic butchery that you’ve just tacitly endorsed.
To the two posters above, I should say that you’re both completely off the mark.
How, I ask, can you accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing when the “indigenous” populations of Palestinians have not only not shrunken, but have grown? You’re both parroting a slew of lies that have been thoroughly discredited and debunked.
How can you say with a straight face that Israel is the criminal state? Do either of you acknowledge that Palestinian and Arab intransigence might play a role? Give the Palestinians their due? For what? For fomenting hatred within every one of their failed generations?
Israel would emphatically benefit from a peaceful accord and a peaceful separation from Palestinians. But when Abu Mazen greets released murderers and the PA gives them a monthly stipend, it’s hard to see why Israel even bothers.
So for the record, you blame Israel for the actions of a Palestinian teenager? Is there no end to what you’ll hold Israel culpable for?
“nathan”, you are selling Hasbara nonsense. It is a FACT that Israel Ethnically Cleansed more than 700,000 Arab Palestinians at Israel’s birth during 1947-48 and destroyed more than 450 Arab Palestinian villages.
Today Israel is a defacto Apartheid State because it refuses to end decades of illegal occupations where the rogue state continues “belligerent” (Israel’s own High Court term) occupation of the Occupied Territories and steals land and resources from them. The “24000” new colonialist homes to be built have only been put on hold. That project has not stopped.
Further, it’s been in all the news, Israel is Ethnically Cleansing more than 40,000 Bedouins RIGHT NOW, the plan is to destroy their village and put instead some sort of Israeli religious town. I could continue for DAYS.
The point is, you are attempting to hold people who are under Israel’s boot responsible for Israel’s illegal actions.
Stop! You have been exposed. Yu cannot change the facts, history, or the reality. Israel is very close to facing the ICC not because of your lame excuses, but because of Israel’s own  actions.
The Palestinians who left Israel in 1948 were not “displaced.” That was deliberate ethnic cleansing, as revealed by Ben-Gurion’s own diaries. Nor is Palestinian territory “disputed.” It is occupied, contrary to international law. This is a sweet little article, but it isn’t journalism.
The land rightfully belongs to Palestine. It had been there for centuries. It had belonged to there ancestors. I could assure you, the land they ost, there were structure that cannot be moved on there, given to those accursed Jews.
I do not agree with Adolf Hitler, but these things that dare to call themselves human beings are making it surprisingly easy How many Muslims were killed by those dogs. Promised lands, my ass. That thing they worship as a book sent by gods, was probably wrote by a deluded megalomania. I am part Palestinian, and at time like these, I cant help but wish Hitler wiped Jewish people off the  face of the earth.
The Christian hold most of Europe and as such, the military power. If they could stay in Europe and keep there noses out of our business, then we would have been winning. If they could keep there noses out, I wouldn’t have lost my grandparents. If they could keep there noses out then there would be no Jews. Who needs them anyway?
I’d love to ask Israel’s critics in which state they would rather live: Israel or Palestine.  No other country in the world faces the existential threats nor criticism that Israel does, yet it still manages to remain the only pluralistic democracy in the Middle East all while sending daily shipments of food and other aid to the very people that are supposedly being ‘occupied.’  Perhaps if more effort went into building up the Palestinian territories into a respectable place to live instead of constantly blaming Israel, the region would be better off for all.
The ONLY existential threat that Israel faces is itself. The extremism, the greed, the arrogance has taken a large toll on the rogue state, so much so that even the paid Israeli trolls bought by the Prime Minister’s Office can’t manage more than a few bleats these days.
Just a few years ago and dozens of those Paid Hasbarians would descend on an Internet thread such as this one and now, just a couple. Why?
Because the truth has caught up to them. Ethnic Cleansing since birth until today, the state is unsustainable as an Apartheid State.
The state of Iran has Never Ever threatened the state of Israel. That lie was put to bed years ago. Hamas is no threat, President Obama has eliminated the CW threat from Syria for Israel and even though Hezbollah beat Israel during the Second Lebanon War (see the Winograd Report), even they represent no real threat to Israel.
These made-up threats are simply ways to avert the world’s eyes from the illegal occupations, the ongoing Ethnic Cleansing, the illegal colonies, and the incessant killing, often of woman and children, even more illegal colonies, its huge.
The onerous is on Israel here–everyone knows that. Nothing will happen until Israel stops breaking international law by confiscating Palestinian lands and resources (water) , period.
For every Israeli that dies in this conflict, 33 Palestinians die. This is a fact.
The onerous is on Israel and the US for it’s unflinching support of Israel through Israel’s coercion of US Politicians.
Time to set the balance here and give the Palestinians their due.
I completely agree with you. The land rightfully belongs to Palestine. It had been there for centuries. It had belonged to there ancestors. I could assure you, the land they ost, there were structure that cannot be moved on there, given to those accursed Jews.
I do not agree with Adolf Hitler, but these things that dare to call themselves human beings are making it surprisingly easy How many Muslims were killed by those dogs. Promised lands, my ass. That thing they worship as a book sent by gods, was probably wrote by a deluded megalomania. I am part Palestinian, and at time like these, I cant help but wish Hitler wiped Jewish people off the  face of the earth.
The Christian hold most of Europe and as such, the military power. If they could stay in Europe and keep there noses out of our business, then we would have been winning. If they could keep there noses out, I wouldn’t have lost my grandparents. If they could keep there noses out then there would be no Jews. Who needs them anyway?
I don’t write off Palestine at all. But it is quite easy to write off the violent state of Israel. The state, born in ethnic cleansing and terrorist violence continues that ethnic cleansing even as I write this with tens of thousands of Bedouins.
Its a shame, but Israel is an extreme failure as a state. No matter what “accomplishments” the state may be able to claim, the “belligerent occupation” of an indigenous people trumps all other history the rogue state may be trying to proclaim.
The violence does not happen in a vacuum, and just a few years ago a team of researchers affiliated with MIT found that Israel instigates or outright shoots first every time it is forced to face the occupations and the bargaining table.
And so it is today. What must be questioned, is a loyalty to a state guilty of the Nakba, the bombing of the King David Hotel, all the way to the announced then hastily hidden additional 24000 colonial habitats for yet tens of thousands more illegal colonists who are OUTSIDE of Israel proper and living within Palestine illegally and violently and belligerently.
Jews, of course, have fundamentally less of a right to self-determination than any other group. Thus Israel should be dissolved; is that correct? Decrying a nation’s policies is very different to denying its very existence, or making it out to be somehow the worst human rights offender.
Further, Palestinian Arabs are indigenous to the Levant? Try telling that to the Assyrians, Copts, Kurds and Armenians. Maybe after you’ve dissolved the state of Israel and made its citizens return to the countries they were evicted from (no compensation for the Jewish Nakba, of course – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries), you could force the Turks return to Central Asia and give their land back to the Armenians, Kurds and Greeks. Maybe the Maghreb could also be given back to the Berbers.
The fact of the matter is, the real problem in this conflict is not the inherently evil, bloodthirsty Zionists, but hardliners – whether they be Jewish Settlers, AIPAC, Hamas fighters or yourself (note that Israeli public opinion is firmly against the settlements) – who would rather that one side pack their bags and piss off as opposed to reaching a lasting and stable agreement.
“tom”, Israel has spent decades stealing land and resources and not making peace. This is beyond debatable it simply is a fact.
Don’t blame Hamas, AIPAC, or me for Israel’s quite public and blatant actions.
