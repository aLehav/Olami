PhD candidates Matthew Fontaine and Samuel Teets, master’s student Nivedit Balam and junior Anna Shaposhnik were able to produce unbelievable masterpieces with just words, such as “wind,” “glass” and “float,” during the first AI + Art Competition held by the Ahmanson Lab Oct. 19.
With the rise of digital media, it’s no surprise that artificial intelligence can make artistic wonders out of mere thoughts. 
AI art merges technology and the human psyche by interpreting text prompts and utilizing algorithms to produce unique pieces drawn from preexisting media, according to the Curtis Fletcher, Director of the Ahmanson Lab. 
“This technology, for the first time in human history, allows us to create images and videos of anything we could possibly imagine,”  Fletcher said.
The first of these AI Art competitions was hosted by the Ahmanson Lab,  part of the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study. Participants utilized Midjourney, one of many artificial intelligence programs, to generate surreal artwork with text prompts.  
Competitors went head to head to see who could come up with the most impressive illustration. As long as the three assigned words were included in their prompt, players could generate almost any textual description imaginable.
The competition was broken into rounds, each of which began with one competitor having three minutes to develop a prompt including the assigned words and generate four images, ultimately selecting their favorite one to upcale and submit for judging.
After the first player’s generation, opposing players could modify up to half of the previous player’s prompt and generate their own image with the goal of improving on the other’s; modification continued until each player had generated three new prompts and images — three “Volleys” back and forth. 
What began as three flat words could eventually develop into a phrase such as “Horror silhouette windmill rim light backlit foggy moonlight illuminated from above by the aurora borealis wintry spindly derelict haunted spirit capture horror film still painting whispering quiet suspense abstract in the style of greg rutkowski ar [sic] 9:16.” 
After six final pieces were generated for a round, a popular vote on the best image decided the winner. The same process was repeated in the second round with three different words — “weather, “hill” and “fly” — and two new competitors. 
The third and final round was a match between the two winners of the previous rounds, Fontaine and Balam, and consisted of only two volleys with the words “winter,” “book” and “draw.” Somehow, Pikachu came into the mix during the final volley. When it came down to the final competition, Fontaine credited his win to the risks he took by using original art styles of the Deep Dream technique as a modifier. 
“I took a risk during the competition by using that modifier, but I lucked out that it turned into something really good,” Fontaine said. “It makes the style very unique because I’m not copying a famous art style, but I do like blending two artists’ styles over time.”
The competition opened the window to a unique audience-artist interaction not typically seen with AI art generation. Waiting for the images to develop was part of the anticipation, and audience members were able to interpret each image and express their own fascinations and emotions. 
Anna Shaposhnik, a junior majoring in arts, technology, and the business of innovation and a participant in the AI + Art competition, noted the feeling of community the event created. 
“People came together, they created stories around those images,” Shaposhnik said.
There is constant debate over whether or not AI art can be classified as “artistic.” Some argue that art requires originality and physical creation, claiming that AI makes it “almost too easy to generate a really great work of art,” as Fontaine pointed out. 
“So it kind of takes away the skill aspect of learning to be an artist,” Fontaine said. “Some people have argued that you’ve replaced that with taste, because now what matters is your own taste in art. It’s like a flip barn.”  
The AI art community is continuously evolving and expanding. Fletcher commented on the ever-changing landscape of AI, and posited that “the lab is, in some ways, a perfect hub for these discussions to take place… trying to gauge what the community is for this and then  building off of that.” 
Fletcher cites the lab as a place not only for the intersection of different disciplines and interests, but between artists and technologists. The competition is a launching pad for students and staff members interested in what AI has to offer and its possible implications. This event embraced the connection between the human imagination and technological advancements. In doing so, it sparked conversation regarding the ethics and extent to which we should rely on artificial intelligence in art — and further in life. 
Undoubtedly, AI art generation takes its own creativity and careful attention. Shaposhnik explained that specificity and familiarity with artists and their visual styles are the most important part of curating the story you want to tell through a prompt. 
One of the most interesting qualities of AI-generated art is how it allows for “unartistic” people to participate. Though it may appear simple to create a fantastical, dreamlike art piece with the right software, that only makes the deceptively tricky practice more difficult to master. 
 “It by definition lowers the barrier of entry for people who can’t create in [traditional] ways, right?” mentioned Fletcher. “But then it also gives superpowers … there are plenty of artists who are now embracing this.” 
Besides, this is a time period that already embraces remixed, remade content. Shaposhnik supports this new art form as a believer that the inspiration we draw from other images prohibits an artist to be “truly original.” While technology can now replicate and mimic distinct art styles, it also has the ability to remix and hybridize styles to create a completely new aesthetic. 
AI caters more to creativity of the imagination, and thus requires a different skillset to produce aesthetically captivating images.
“It is just shifting the part where you get to be creative,” Fletcher said. “Like I actually can’t produce very good images, because I don’t know, I don’t know the right ways to describe the stuff. Someone with a PhD in English, it turns out, he’s really good at it … So there’s a skill set there.” 
There is no telling what the future looks like for AI-generated art. The possibilities are endless. No matter one’s standpoint on the AI art phenomenon, technology will continue to advance and exceed human capabilities. Mats Borges, the project specialist at the Ahmanson Lab, believes it is crucial to encourage discussion around the ethics and implications of rapidly developing technology because it is already so integrated into our communities. 
While AI-generated media is foreign to many, Fletcher believes it will exponentially improve and develop due to its ability to alter “our appearance, how we sound, and our identity.” 
“In some ways, but not really in real time. AI is going to make it so that we can consistently alter that stuff in real time,” said Fletcher. Reality and technology will continue to converge and blur together, and rather than trying to stop it, people need to be educated on it and weigh its benefits and harms. 
This competition is only the beginning of a future of possibilities for AI art, according to Borges.
 “It’s gonna go everywhere,” Borges said. “It’s going to be part of our lives, like, how photography is now in our cell phones.”

Since 2016, fentanyl overdoses have been on the rise and today fentanyl is the number one cause of drug overdoses and deaths. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2020, there were approximately 92,000 fentanyl-poisoning related deaths across the world, a devastating number that is only continuing to rise year by year. 
Fentanyl is a highly addictive and extremely powerful synthetic opioid, just two milligrams of the drug — the equivalent of a few grains of salt — is considered a lethal dose. While it is considered safe when professionally prescribed, it is often illegally used at a much higher dosage. Drug manufacturers will often mix fentanyl into other illegal substances such as cocaine and ecstasy because it is a cheaper alternative that is often easier for them to get their hands on. Dealers try to make a quick buck by selling it to unknowing customers, therefore putting these customers at high risk of an accidental overdose or fentanyl poisoning. 
This is a serious issue that we all must address, and while it may seem like the obvious choice to just eliminate all illegal drugs, that’s, frankly, impossible. We as a society must do a better job at compassionately addressing the ongoing issues of drug use, fentanyl-lacing, overdoses and addiction across the world. The first step in that process is to approach the situation in a realistic way because it’s past time that we accept the fact that prohibition does not work. 
While it may sound pessimistic, we must admit that in the modern world where technology has offered an unprecedented level of access, people will always find a way to get their hands on drugs and use them recreationally regardless of whatever laws exist or may exist in the future.  Addiction is real and cannot be addressed solely by our efforts and forewarnings. 
One effective approach that has already been implemented in some communities is the provision of resources for “safer” drug use. The National Harm Reduction Coalition  is an organization that supports the lowering of drug-related risks, such as overdoses as well as diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, by applying evidence-based harm reduction strategies around safer drug use. 
From providing sterile syringe access to supervised consumption services, the Coalition contextualizes drug use and acknowledges that addiction is not a choice. It is a disease — one that is killing thousands because of improper and unsterile drug administration. While there is no doubt that drug use will always be accompanied by great risks, we can certainly advocate for safer drug use in an attempt to lessen the risks of drug use and prevent accidental deaths and overdoses.  
Promoting safer drug use can be done in a variety of ways, such as encouraging individuals to test their drugs for unwanted substances, like fentanyl, before use. Several countries have begun to embrace this kind of approach to the opioid epidemic.  The Netherlands even has anonymous drug testing sites available to all its citizens and tourists across the country, and has already seen a decrease in overdose fatalities. 
Another resource is supervised consumption services, which are designated sites where people can use pre-acquired drugs under the supervision of a trained professional, significantly reducing the risk of overdose. Supervised consumption services have been growing in prominence over the last thirty years and now have over 100 sites in over 60 cities and 11 countries across the world. The effectiveness of these sites is evident and hopefully they will continue to be implemented worldwide. Key benefits shown with SCS include reduction of overdosing, injection-related infections, improvement of health and drug treatment services to those addicted to drugs, public safety and finances as it saves millions of dollars just with the reduction of HIV infections.
While some people believe access to these resources are responsible for promoting drug use, their true goal is to keep individuals safe and prevent drug-induced deaths — which they have accomplished with flying colors. Access to these resources is undoubtedly essential in combating the opioid epidemic and preventing overdoses in society. 
Advocating for safe drug use, even for illicit substances, isn’t a scheme to increase drug abuse but rather a method meant to save lives and allow addicts to seek help without fear. Until our attitude and methods of combating drug abuse changes, it will only continue to grow and take lives.

Though Hufflepuffs are known for being warm and kind, despite the Sorting Hat’s claims in The Philosopher’s Stone, this is what wizards and muggles alike hold to be true: 
“When you don the hat, if Hogwarts doesn’t quite know what to do with you but thinks you aren’t likely to commit a serious wizarding crime, you’ll be sorted into Hufflepuff.” 
Slytherins have a reputation for being cunning and strategic. Gryffindors are selected for their bravery, confidence and hearts of gold and iron. Ravenclaws tend to gravitate towards academia and consistently house epistemophiles and philomaths. But Hufflepuffs? They’re often sorted upon the “we love your qualities and what you bring but don’t have a tailored placement for you” approach. 
Though USC isn’t as historic or magical as Hogwarts, at times it’s easy to notice the wizarding world manifesting on campus. And no, I’m not talking about Bovard as the Ministry of Magic or Marshall as Slytherin. I’m talking about life as a USC Hufflepuff: a Dornsife student.
USC has several top-ranking schools, but it is best known for three in particular: School of Cinematic Arts, Marshall School of Business and Thornton School of Music. Yet, with 22 schools finite resources, the focus of administration is often divided, and doled and diminished — which means that unless you’re a student at one of those 3 schools, sorry, but you’re not Mom’s favorite. And if you’re in Dornsife, you’re on your own, kid.
The Hufflepuff of USC colleges, Dornsife, houses students whose studies range from neuroscience to creative writing to mine: philosophy, politics and economics. 
With such a broad emphasis and diverse array of disciplines, it is virtually impossible for Dornsife  to aid and guide students in the way that Thornton or SCA does. Where Thornton and SCA are specialists, Dornsife is a generalist. 
If you browse Dornsife’s website and scroll to their “About Us” page, what you’ll see is a lot of “fact figures.” In Dornsife, it’s not just easy to feel like a number — per their website, it seems like you are a number, simply quantified in their 36 academic departments, 97 undergraduate majors and 7,965 undergraduates. 
Compare that to Glorya Kaufman School of Dance’s 1 major and 4 minors or Annenberg’s 2,300 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. 
While there’s no denying Dornsife’s Hogwarts affiliation, I’d be lying if I denied the hidden perks of life as an ‘SC Hufflepuff.
It’s true that Dornsife students outnumber those studying at schools like Annenberg which is made up of 2,300 students and Marshall with 4,064 undergraduates. Upon closer inspection, however, this may prove an advantage.
Larger numbers help foster a broader sense of community and encourage the formation of sub-communities and interest groups of students helping students. Thus, one might argue for the strength of the “Dornsife connection” — with a larger student body, students seeking community are required to invest more energy in their endeavors, leading to the formation of tight-knit groups by diverse, incredibly motivated individuals. 
Changing or declaring a new major or minor within a student’s current school is typically a much easier process than doing so within another. Thus, with a wide variety of majors and minors, Dornsife students are able and encouraged to pursue a well-rounded, liberal arts education. In preparation for a career in diplomacy, one might pair a major in international relations and the global economy with minors in linguistics and philosophy. For those interested in a career in the business of biotechnology, a double major in biological sciences (biotechnology) and economics with a minor in sociology is possible as well. 
Though it may seem like Dornsife is playing a numbers game, the benefit may be on the side of its students. Don’t be fooled — being a small fish in a big sea can actually prove valuable for the refinement of character, grit and accountability. With a parenting style that discourages coddling, Dornsife toughens its students to become independent self-advocates. The resources are there, it’s just a matter of knowing when, where and how to look.  
Organizationally, can Dornsife be chaotic? Yes. Are students in Dornsife the USC version of Hufflepuffs? For sure. Can life as an ‘SC Hufflepuff prove challenging? Absolutely. But, challenge and chaos is where growth truly occurs — otherwise, contentment fosters complacency and in turn, mediocrity. 
So hold your heads high ‘SC Hufflepuffs, Dornsife might be a generalist, but we’ll walk out of here with more Golden Snitches than you’ll think. Take it from a Slytherin. (I solemnly swear.)

Sports fanbases, by and large, derive from prideful regionalism and enthusiastic belonging. Association football provides different caveats compared to other sports due to their national team tournaments. National team matches or bouts ultimately diminish, albeit temporarily, the stark divide between domestic clubs and bring together fanbases from different communities. The fusion of all backgrounds and identities creates an atmosphere with an unparalleled effect distinguishable from club environments. Simply put, attending a Real Madrid match is holistically different than observing the robust surroundings at a Spain’s national team match. 
One of the world’s most popular sporting events, the FIFA World Cup, will kick off this Sunday in what will definitely be a tournament of mesmerizing magnitude. Besides the amalgamation of multiple nations, the World Cup provides a rare showcase of unity despite the competitive background and bears witness to the lively fan bases derived from national pride and patriotism. 
World Cup Symbolism
The World Cup’s far-reaching influence continues beyond the month-long tournament. Qualification for the World Cup alone has profound, hopeful implications for struggling nations. 
Following Côte d’Ivoire’s last-minute qualification to the 2006 World Cup hosted in Germany, famous footballer Didier Drogba spoke to a TV camera and urged his home country struggling with civil conflict to cease fire and hold elections. Although the sole football campaign objectively conveys nothing more than a trivial sporting event, Drogba managed to recontextualize the situation and use the crowning achievement as a way to unite the polarized nation. 
The World Cup’s allure proved equally influential for Honduras during the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign. Although just qualifying for the second time in the federation’s history, Honduras’ victory in the campaign’s last matchday represented a beacon of hope as the nation had recently experienced an administration change from a coup d’état months earlier. 
Thin Line Between Pride and Perverse Patriotism
Although the World Cup provides profound symbolism to countries in dire need of hope, sports, in general, sometimes become politicized. Brazil’s signature yellow-and-green jersey has gradually grown ties with the right-wing faction of the nation’s political spectrum. Specifically, the traditional jersey, once emblematic of the five World Cups won by the most successful nation in the tournament’s history, currently represents support for right-wing Jair Bolsonaro and his current administration. 
Amid the controversial process of naming Qatar as the host of the 2022 World Cup, multiple parties have criticized the nation for human rights violations during the build-up for the tournament. Rather than criticize the government and policies, other parties opted to blatantly degrade and dehumanize Qatari citizens. The French newspaper, Le Canard enchainé, released a cartoon that included racist and Islamophobic depictions of Qatari footballers.    
Overt, perverse patriotism and racism rear their ugly head toward players of color during national play. Burgeoning Canadian star, Mark-Anthony Kaye, experienced racial abuse through social media from Canadian fans following his send-off against Costa Rica during qualifiers. Oftentimes, this national pride disintegrates and fans regress into racism against their compatriots and villainize players of color when they do not follow their lofty expectations. 
Heartwarming Harmony
The World Cup, at times, overcomes racial barriers and presents sportsmanship and harmony between diverse fanbases. Following their last-minute defeat and elimination against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup, Japan’s national football team bowed to the visiting fans before cleaning up their locker room and leaving a thank-you note to Russian staffers. 
In the same tournament, Mexico national team fans celebrated and paraded with South Koreans after the Asian side eliminated Germany and granted qualification for the Latin American team. I vividly remember walking through Koreatown and witnessing the mesmerizing fusion and harmony between Mexicans and South Koreans as they treated each other as companions rather than convenient neighbors. 
I hope that the upcoming World Cup will again provide its allure, break down barriers and bridge the gap between communities while helping us momentarily forget about the global conflicts ravaging our world.

People lined up on the Row the night of Oct. 29, waiting outside as they watched robots fill their pizza orders on a screen. This was the official opening night for Stellar Pizza, a robot-run pizza truck operating in front of Phi Kappa Tau. The business was offering free pizza as a promotion for its launch. The truck can be found most weekend evenings around USC Village or the Row. Hours are subject to change over the next few weeks and will be updated on the Stellar Pizza app and Instagram account. 
A big goal for Stellar Pizza is to make food more affordable, said Benson Tsai, chief executive officer of the business. Tsai noted that college students were “a customer base that really wants good, fast, affordable foods.”
“With the cost of a college education being so high these days, I think it’s important that the cost of living be somewhat reduced or stay reasonable,” he said. In regards to the price of the pizza, he believes that “the only way it’s achievable is ultimately through robots.”
Students have varied opinions about robots preparing their pizza. Steven Parson, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, shared his main reservation about trying the food. 
“It’s a constant fight between quality and quantity,” he said. 
Nevertheless, he was excited to have more late-night eating options available at USC outside of the USC Village, and was willing to give it a try. 
Amrina Roy, a graduate student studying business analytics, said she thought that the robotic aspect of the food truck was great. 
“I am a technical person, I am from a technical background; this seems very good for me. It’s like a pizza factory inside a truck, which is insane,” she said. 
Rylan Giorgetta, a sophomore majoring in classics and archeology, has already tried the pizza twice. His main takeaways were that it was good and inexpensive. 
“It comes out to be a pretty decent pizza, so it’s not lacking in that aspect,” he said. 
Giorgetta said that people generally tend to prefer handmade food, and he agreed with this to an extent. However, he still thinks the robotic model can be beneficial. 
“If you’re paying less, I think it’s worth it,” he said.  
The truck has a screen on the outside to display the pizza while it is being made, showing that the process used by the robots is relatively similar to that of a human. The machine opens the dough, adds sauce, cheese and toppings, and then cooks it. While the process of pizza-making itself is similar, the machinery took about 30 rocket scientists to develop. The biggest challenge comes in programming the robots to identify when there is something wrong with the pizza, Tsai said. 
Tsai initially worked on trucks and buses in Silicon Valley and spent time working for SpaceX, but eventually switched over to the food business, believing that this idea could bring together his work history and his experience as a chemical engineering major. 
“Stellar Pizza is bringing all of my professional history and channeling all of the network and my experience into something that I was really passionate about once upon a time,” he said. 
Another concern Tsai has heard regarding the idea is that it could get rid of jobs for people. However, he argues that the amount of money robot-made food will save people can make up for the number of potential jobs that are replaced. He said he believes this format is the “future of the restaurant industry,” and automated machines already dispense drinks in fast food restaurants and produce food sold in grocery stores. 
“It’s very cool, but it’s not revolutionary,” he said. 
Customers can use the Stellar Pizza app to find the exact location of the truck as it moves around. It will typically be located around the Row or near USC Village.

What happened to Los Angeles’ food insecurity crisis during and after the peak of the coronavirus pandemic? To answer this question, Kayla de la Haye, an associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine, led a team of researchers to collaborate with the Los Angeles County Food Equity Roundtable and faculty members from The City University of New York to construct a comprehensive data portal that monitors food and nutrition access and insecurity.
The project’s research in July found that 24.3% of L.A. County households were food insecure in the past year. Individuals from low-income households and those identifying as Latinx experienced the worst food insecurity, the study found. 
Food insecurity refers to a temporary or long-term lack of consistent access to sufficient food for every person in a household to live a healthy life. It is different from hunger — food insecurity in the long run results in higher risks for cardiovascular disease and higher overall death rates.
The three-year project utilized data gathered from survey panels, big data, government sources and community partners to build a conceptual model of food insecurity within the L.A. County food system. 
“Because the things that impact food and nutrition security are so complicated, to understand and monitor them, we can’t just rely on one type of survey data,” de la Haye said. 
One significant piece of information that government sources provide is the number of L.A. residents enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, CalFresh, which issues monthly payments as electronic benefit cards to qualified low-income households to purchase food. 
Community partners generate data to identify the food outlets in L.A. County, which informs people about the type of food and the operating status of the food sources. The project analyzes the information to gather the number of food outlets closed during the pandemic and understand how their closures impacted food access. 
With all of the data gathered from different platforms, the research team now has to decide on the kind of information to incorporate into the quantitative analysis process. In particular, the results of survey panels may lead to the selection of certain data sets that represent the ongoing situation. 
“We will also evaluate whether the information it provides really matters [to] people … and how we can make best use of the information we get of what people said,” said Mengya Xu, a project researcher and graduate student studying population, health and place.
The information is then coded and displayed online to share with government, community and private partners in a timely manner to address food insecurity issues in L.A. 
When the pandemic first hit and triggered a widespread food insecurity crisis, a previous partnership between the researchers and the L.A. County Emergency Food Security Branch helped identify populations at risk for food insecurity. 
The team’s research shows that about 1.2 million L.A. County households experienced food insecurity between April and December of 2020. 
However, as the research went on, the team realized they lacked integrated information about the different aspects of the food system, such as the accessibility to various food outlets and food assistance. This led them to further investigate ways to collect and analyze the data. 
“There is a lack of that data and a lack of monitoring. One good example of this is, when the pandemic hit, the latest statistics we had on food insecurity were from 2018,” de la Haye said. 
Building on previous work and with a $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the ongoing project aims to connect policymakers and organizations with accurate information to help residents have access to healthy food.
Jose Scott, a graduate student studying public policy and management who had been conducting interviews with residents, said a big takeaway from the conversations is how creative the people are in terms of utilizing limited food sources to survive food insecurity. 
“Some people found themselves, for example, trying recipes they have never tried before,” Scott said. “There was a lot of TikToking and trying new recipes on the internet.” 
The rate of L.A. households experiencing food insecurity dropped following the height of the pandemic. However, a recent research brief shows a significant increase in the rate, up to 24.3% as of July 2022 from 16.6% in 2021. 
De la Haye said that some factors have worsened the food insecurity crisis, one of being the rising inflation rate across the country. As food prices go up, the burden on low-income households to have enough healthy food becomes heavier. 
Another factor is the decrease in the number of food assistance programs. Once the pandemic began to wane, so too did government aid, which led to a tight budget for many families. 
“This issue of poor food access and food and nutrition insecurity impacts a lot of people in L.A. County, … but it does not impact everyone equally,” de la Haye said. “It really is a big food justice issue.”
