USC wrapped up its appeal of NCAA sanctions Saturday, meeting with the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in Indianapolis for four hours 13 minutes.
President C.L. Max Nikias, athletic director Pat Haden, Vice President for Athletic Compliance David Roberts and the university’s lawyers met with the five-member committee in the hope of scaling back penalties handed down to the football program last June. The Trojans want the NCAA to reduce its two-year bowl ban to one year. They’re also hoping the NCAA will limit scholarship reductions to five in each of the next three years as opposed to the previously scheduled 10.
When asked by Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times, Nikias thanked the committe for the opportunity to present the school’s case and described the process as “a good and fair hearing. We just have to wait for the ruling.”
A ruling is expected to be released in four to six weeks.

Former USC quarterback and current New York Jets signal caller Mark Sanchez is set to make his second debut in the AFC Championship after doing so a season ago.
Last week, the Jets stunned the Patriots in a dramatic 28-21 win Sunday and aim to do the same this weekend.
Yet, this is still unfamiliar territory for Sanchez, as he hopes to lead the Jets to their first Super Bowl since 1968, but to their rival it’s nothing new. The Pittsburgh Steelers know the severity of this game all too well.
Led by a former Trojan as well in safety Troy Polamalu, the Steelers hope to make their eighth Super Bowl appearance, potentially adding another title to their current six – the most in NFL history.
Defense is said to win games, and the Jets proved testament to that theory, shutting down both the Patriot’s passing and running game last week, forcing Tom Brady to throw his first interception in more than 200 completed passes.
The Steelers, however, are known for their defense as well, as Polamalu has recorded 63 tackles and seven interceptions this season. Despite suffering an injury to his Achilles tendon, the former USC defensive back practiced with the team on Friday and is expected to be ready to go Sunday.
Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger face his old WR Santonio Holmes, whose memorable catch in Super Bowl XLIII two years ago against the Arizona Cardinals, allowed the organization to capture its sixth title.
Both quarterbacks will be under intense scrutiny this week, as two of the league’s toughest defenses go  head-to-head.
