In honor of National Reading Month, this week retail giant Amazon.com offered a $20 discount on all Kindle models, slashing the price of the basic model to just $49.
I used to think the Kindle was an idiotic device, or, at best, something you could read while holding a snifter in the other hand. With the Kindle app on my phone, iPad, and even desktop, I couldn’t understand why anybody would shell out for a device on which all you can do is read. I recently gave my iPad to my younger brother and bought myself a Kindle after realizing that the problem with having a device that allows you to do anything and read, is that you will do anything but read.
With talk becoming increasingly cheap, critical reading — the ability to discern underlying patterns from the deluge of information we are presented with — is an increasingly important skill. But, as a willing victim of our over-sharing culture, I find myself skimming through text with the pointless goal of trying to be the first one to “break” the news to my semi-avid following. This means I end up sharing stuff that no one else finds interesting, and that I lose interest in shortly after. When using my Kindle, I at least have to put it down before sharing my profound revelations.
This is not, by any means, ground-breaking thought. Open any introductory text on economics, and you can read about Tom and Harry struggling on an imaginary island which bizarrely has only fish and coconuts. They quickly realize that if one fishes and the other gathers, they will both be slightly less miserable on their island, what economists call “maximizing their comparative advantage.” The idea that specialization and subsequent trade is beneficial to all parties is as old as the field itself.
This idea also explains last month’s $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, a cross-platform messaging service with a huge user base, by Facebook, social media giant and industry icon. Facebook has enjoyed its monopoly of the social media industry for years but is realizing that it faces a threat from more specialized services. If I can blog on Tumblr and Twitter, share photos on Instagram (another Facebook aquisition) and interact with my future boss on LinkedIn, why should I use Facebook?
Facebook is making the same realization that Tom and Harry did: you can’t do everything and be the best at it. Its blogging, photo-sharing and mobilizing features are being eclipsed by services that are simply more dedicated. Newer apps like Whisper and Secret, which allow users to interact anonymously, are now moving in to satisfy an even more basic human desire: expression without repercussion. As the gender-confused arms dealer Max in Mission Impossible said, “Anonymity… is like a warm blanket.”
The challenge for Facebook in the coming years will be to demonstrate to its users why they should still use it. I’ve already deleted the app from my phone, and instructed my browsers to limit me to 10 minutes a day. My productivity has gone up, and I feel better about myself too. I’ve kept Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram for now, and I have nothing on my Kindle. I like it better that way. I still don’t read as much as I would like to, but my desire to maximize my $69 (I purchased mine before National Reading Month) coupled with the absence of any other apps means I’ve at least been reading more, and, hopefully, am wiser for it.

With the Academy Awards last weekend, a new season of films has officially begun. March should bring more new releases each weekend than January and February, which are typically slow months for theaters because of the awards season.
This weekend has three nationwide releases, all playing to very different audiences. 300: Rise of an Empire should capture the male demographic, while Mr. Peabody & Sherman will replace The Lego Movie’s as the dominant family flick. Wes Anderson’s quirky film The Grand Budapest Hotel will play to a more artsy crowd, attracting not only art film fans but fans of the film’s ensemble cast.
300: Rise of an Empire is a continuation to the story in 2007’s 300 and is based on Frank Miller’s still unreleased graphic novel Xerxes, which focuses on the Battle of Artemisium. Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green play the main protagonists of the film, but there will still be some familiar faces from the first film, such as Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes and Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo.
While the film has received mostly mixed reviews, the fanbase for the original film, which can be considered a cult classic, will bring audiences to the theater this weekend. Fans should expect this installment to be just as gory and violent as its predecessor. Look for it to be at the top of the box office this weekend.
The second nationwide release, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, looks to also garner large audiences.  Starring Ty Burrell, Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann, among other notable actors, the film has received many positive reviews. Based on the characters that originated from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, it tells the story of how the smartest dog in the world’s time machine launches him and his adopted boy on an outrageous adventure. The film should appeal to audiences from any age demographic. It should also perform very well this weekend.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is the newest Wes Anderson film to grace theaters. It features a star-studded cast including the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton and Jeff Goldblum. His last film, 2012’s Moonrise Kingdom, was nominated for an Academy Award, which has only helped increase his immense fanbase. It might be a turnoff to most blockbuster fans, but should still attract a decent crowd.

I recently became reacquainted with pesto – the healthy basil puree that is often eaten with pasta or with chicken.
About a week ago, I was filming a segment for the Trojan Vision Show, Delish, at the Good Karma Cafe, an on-campus eatery open Tuesday and Thursday that accommodates vegetarian students. The head chef began making some fresh pesto for his penne pasta. The pesto was made effortlessly out of basil, almonds, olive oil and some onion and garlic replacements and, when blended with the pasta, created sheer joy in my mouth.
I decided to make my own, but without basil – I used parsley instead. The pesto came out tasting a little different than expected, but all in all it was not bad and it tasted fresh, which was ultimately my goal. My pesto recipe was a variation of Bon Appétit’s Spaghetti with Parsley Pesto, but I think mine was better.
The variations of pesto out there are astounding. I came across a recipe that called for mild-tasting miso – yes, the same ingredient as in the popular Japanese Miso Soup – pine nuts, and habanero peppers.
Although it is traditionally made with Parmesan cheese, pesto can easily be made vegan. Pesto recipes often call for some Parmesan to be added into the mix to add that savory kick to that fresh taste that we enjoy so much, but you do not need it. Parmesan adds a kick and provides texture. The Parmesan can be replaced by nutritional yeast, leaving it out altogether or by adding extra nuts like walnuts and almonds.
Nuts can also be an issue in pesto, so there are nut-free options. Two Peas & Their Pod has a great recipe for nut-free pesto. This husband and wife duo has replaced nuts with an assortment of fresh flavors like, lemon juice, garlic and spinach for the texture and thickness of the sauce.
There are so many pesto recipes out there, and my favorite part is that it does not have to be made with basil; pesto can be made with parsley, mint, rosemary and also cilantro. The rosemary pesto is definitely next on my list to make – the aroma alone will have me swooning.
I think I forgot to mention how simple pesto is to make homemade; it’s ridiculously simple – all you need is a blender or a food processor.

Alegra’s Parsley Pesto (A variation of Bon Appétit’s Spaghetti with Parsley Pesto)
 What you will need:
4 cups of parsley (the leaves, packed)
½ cup of unsalted almonds
¾ cup of chopped green onion
¾ cup extra virgin olive oil
½ cup finely grated Parmesan
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt
Directions:
Pulse the almonds in a food processor until smooth. Add the parsley, chopped green onion, extra virgin olive oil and Parmesan and process until smooth. To finish it off, season the pesto with salt and pepper to taste.
