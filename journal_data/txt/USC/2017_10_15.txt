Sporting pink uniforms in support for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the No. 6 women’s soccer team hosted Colorado last Friday. Entering the match, the Women of Troy boasted a 4-0-1 conference record compared to the Buffaloes’ 1-3-1 mark. The Trojans were coming off a strong two-game stretch in Arizona, and they were able to bring the intensity back to Southern California — dominating Colorado 2-0. 
Unlike their recent performances, the Trojans’ fast-paced offense struck early against the Buffaloes. In the sixth minute, freshman forward Tara McKeown worked herself deep into the Colorado defensive zone and played a beautiful cross up to the top of the six-yard box. With a one-touch shot, redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony slammed the ball off the crossbar and into the Colorado goal to put the Trojans up by one. The goal was Anthony’s fifth of the season; she now leads the team in that category.
In the 17th minute, the Women of Troy drove up the center of the field, and freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo advanced the ball through the Colorado defense to senior midfielder Sydney Sladek. With a cross-body shot, Sladek slotted the ball to the far post to score USC’s second goal.
It is no secret that the Trojans have struggled with in-game consistency. In several matches this season, USC got off to an early lead but found difficulty closing the match. However, that was not the case in this game. The Women of Troy found success in breaking down the Colorado defense and generating scoring opportunities — tallying 23 shots to Colorado’s nine.
Due to redshirt senior Dominique Randle’s red card against Arizona State, freshman defender Jessica Haidet stepped into the backline during Randle’s suspension. Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins was out of commission with an injury, leaving senior goalkeeper Julia Murphy responsible for tending the net.
The Buffaloes’ best scoring chance came in the 85th minute. Several steps outside the 18-yard box, Colorado midfielder Cassie Phillips delivered a rocket on target on the USC goal. But Murphy was able to get a finger on the ball to deflect the shot onto the crossbar. That save, in conjunction with the Trojans’ stellar defense, earned the team its sixth shutout of the season and Murphy’s first career clean sheet.
The Women of Troy kept the pressure on the Buffaloes until the very last second. In the final minute of the match, junior forward Leah Pruitt played a cross to fellow junior forward Erika Okuma directly in front of the Colorado goal. Okuma placed back-to-back shots on frame but was denied by the crossbar and then by redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Jalen Tompkins.
USC closed the game with a 2-0 victory. The win improved the team’s overall record to 11-1-1 and conference record to 5-0-1. The Women of Troy will now travel to Washington for a two-game stretch against Washington (Thursday) and Washington State (Sunday).

Two yards.
That’s all that kept USC from its season being over, its College Football Playoff hopes narrowed significantly and national championship hopes dashed. 
But instead, redshirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris dove and tackled Utah quarterback Troy Williams as he ran for the end zone. Williams fell two yards shy, failing to execute the two-point conversion and the entire Coliseum breathed a deep sigh of relief.
Every season has its defining moments — those moments that determine whether you win or lose, whether you walk away deflated or exhilarated, relieved or disappointed. And it’s how you perform in those crucial moments that separates champions from runner-ups, that either keeps your hype train running or grinds it to a halt.
So far this season, USC has had three of those moments. The first was the double-overtime win over Texas, when redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold led the Trojans on a miraculous game-tying drive and then delivered in the extra sessions. The second was in Pullman, Wa., where Darnold did not have similar luck, fumbling away USC’s final hope.
The third was on Saturday, when the Trojans overcame a 14-point halftime deficit and took the lead in the final minutes, only to see the Utes drive right back down the field, score a touchdown and then go for the win on a gusty two-point conversion attempt instead of just kicking the extra point and forcing overtime.
“I would not have switched the decision at the end,” Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham said. “Darnold was on fire, and I thought that was the percentage play. And if I had to do it again, I’d to the same thing.”
In other words, Whittingham thought that the odds of his team scoring from three yards out were better than defending Darnold in overtime. He played those odds, and they didn’t work out.
But imagine if they had. Imagine if Harris didn’t wrap up Williams, if the Utah quarterback had scored, if the 13th-ranked Trojans had fallen to the unranked Utes. It would have been more than deflating, especially a day after Athletic Director Lynn Swann told reporters he was a little disappointed USC wasn’t undefeated. It would have drastically lessened USC’s likelihood of winning the Pac-12 South and playing for a Pac-12 championship, which Swann said was the goal for this season. And it would have lit a fire under critics already unhappy about the Trojans’ haphazard performance thus far, even in their wins.
Such as this one. The Trojans were, as Darnold said, “lackadaisical” in the first half. They had just nine fewer yards of total offense than Utah but entered the locker room down 21-7 because of three turnovers and several big plays by the Utes. It wasn’t a bad performance offensively, but Darnold could not stop fumbling, and junior running back Ronald Jones II let a backwards pass hit him in the face, resulting in a turnover.
There was no way USC should have had to dig this deep just to beat Utah, a team that was pounded by Stanford last week — and USC had routed Stanford in Week 2.
This has come to define the Trojans’ season — giving inferior opponents openings and opportunities to hang around, to grab an early lead and then suddenly be in control of the game. Instead of seizing on the home crowd and making an early statement, USC “beat themselves,” head coach Clay Helton said.    
“We’d like to not have these closer games if we can help it,” Darnold said.
But they can help it. That’s the frustrating part about this USC team. Sure, it is 6-1 and the highest-ranked Pac-12 team, but the Trojans are not playing like a team that belongs in the playoff. Almost losing to both unranked Texas and Utah at home does not bode well for when USC plays Notre Dame on the road next week, much less Alabama if it somehow makes the playoff.
Conversely, however, all the Trojans have to do is get there — as in, get to the Rose Bowl like they did last season and then count on Darnold to work his magic. Just get into the playoff, and perhaps Wonder Sam can do the same against the likes of Alabama.
Helton has a cliche that he repeats almost every postgame press conference, and that’s the goal of being 1-0 each week. It sounds corny — no, it is corny — but in all honesty, it’s probably the best assessment of USC to this point because no one knows what else to think right now. The Trojans are winning games, but not the way we expected them to. They are playing well, but not to the point that makes anyone remotely comfortable about the remainder of the season.
In essence, they are playing a lot of close games, where the result will often depend on a play or two. On Saturday, it came down to two whole yards. Six feet. Seventy-two inches.
So, you can probably count on it: This won’t be the last time USC’s season will come down to the wire in the final minute of the fourth quarter. Buckle up, if you haven’t already.

Annie Clark, better known by her stage name St. Vincent, has earned status as a pop rock icon not just because she’s collaborated with rockstar legends Kurt Cobain and David Byrne, or because she at times sounds like a spiritual manifestation of Prince or David Bowie, but because she is the St. Vincent. Her fifth studio album, Masseduction, is one of the few albums I would forcibly sit someone down to listen to and is my top contender for album of the year thus far. 
St. Vincent is one of the few pop artists who wields absolute control over every aspect of the album-making process. There’s simply no need for her to be propped up by an assembly line of songwriters and producers, because even music industry veterans know not to undercut her extraordinary expertise — one which has produced the most infectious, without being over-the-top, and emotional, without being (totally) melancholy, albums I’ve heard this year. 
She demonstrates a remarkable curatorial instinct, able to pull together an album that cohesively blends a range of genres such as new-wave disco-tech, chamber pop and psychedelic rock, all without a single clumsy track. This album is packed with an insufferable tension as she captures themes of existential anxiety, unapologetic hedonism, shattering heartbreak, looming mortality and adolescent fantasies. While each track serves as fragments to a larger narrative context, they each unravel their own complex world. 
The album begins with Clark ruminating about a past volatile romance as she explores the more tragic aspects of love, drawing allusions to wreckage and disasters such as a plane crash and taxicab accident on “Hang on Me.” She does that beautiful thing where it sounds like the damper pedal is put down over her voice, backed by luxuriously smooth electric guitar sounds. 
The next track, “Pills,” is perhaps the most conceptually interesting on the album. The track begins hurtling toward a frantic, techno pace that accompanies an eerie, looped chant that sounds like what you would hear as the anthem to a dystopian regime. It’s broken down by a Kamasi Washington saxophone section before slowing down toward one of my favorite parts of the album, an invigorating comedown that is reminiscent of the outro of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” as she sings the powerful lyrics “come all you wasted, wretched and scorned” and “everyone you love will all go away.”
The title track “Masseduction,” stylistically reminiscent of David Bowie, introduces the thesis of the album: “I can’t turn off what turns me on.” Clark juxtaposes pain and pleasure until the phrases “mass seduction” and “mass destruction” become indistinguishably conflated. 
Ironically, the song “Happy Birthday, Johnny” was the most minimalist production-wise but had the most cathartic impact. The lyrics are nostalgic for a love in New York City and serves as a crooked lullaby to a misunderstood lover. This is one of those ballads that makes very specific references but feels devastatingly personal to any listener.
The album’s smoldering edge soon returns on “Savior,” with its catchy melody and erotic undertones. This song projects a taunting, role-playing caricature that is oddly sandwiched between two of the most personal and heart-rending ballads that come from Clark’s authentic voice. 
The quiver in her voice at the end of when she says “you’re the only mother f-cker in the city / who’d forgive me” on the track “New York” is enough to wreck me every time. Although this song had already been released as a single, it took on a deeper meaning when fit into the context of the album. It is a melancholy, string swept ballad that describes how the absence of one person can make a home seem suddenly unfamiliar. 
“Young Lover” has a danceable beat but describes the horrific memory of seeing a loved one passed out from an overdose. It seems to provide a conclusion for “Pills” and serve as a cautionary tale about medication and addiction.
“Dancing With A Ghost” is a brisk, dreamy, wordless interlude that serves as the pre-game for one of the most sensational tracks on the album, “Slow Disco,” a sad waltz with hypnotizing smooth strings and harmonies. Her voice almost cracks as she sings “slip my hand / from your hand / leave you dancing with a ghost.” The song is the perfect transition into the final track as this triumph of an album draws to a close with “Smoking Section.” After all of the chaos and heartbreak presented throughout the album, she contemplates going to the edge and nearly giving into the darkness. But alas, she deliberately takes a step back. 
“It’s not the end” she repeats 12 times, before her voice gradually slips away, leaving listeners with a final message of hope and healing.

Last December, I had a change of heart. After months of failed persuasion and coercion, I finally relented to friends and attended my first rave in San Diego. Dancing to deafening music until 4 a.m. and being surrounded by thousands of inebriated people didn’t exactly appeal to me. But by the end of the night, I was sold. I became one of them. 
The experience of being at OMFG! NYE 2017 completely erased any of my preconceived notions about the rave experience and electronic dance music. That night, Adventure Club performed a remix to one of my favorite songs, “Crave You.” I was in the company of my best friends, hearing brand new sounds pulsating through my body and meeting new people all around me. It was an experience unlike anything I had ever gone through. However, one thing I couldn’t help to notice was the sheer number of Asian people who shared the same space with me.
I first learned about the rave experience as a high school sophomore. Many of the graduating seniors had planned their post-graduation trip, a three-day weekend in Las Vegas to attend Insomniac Events’ iconic Electric Daisy Carnival. Initially, I thought it was just a trend that would die out quickly. But it never did. I began to notice that raving was not a coming-of-age phenomenon only prevalent at La Quinta High School — it became a rite of passage for Asian American teens in Southern California.

But even after becoming part of this experience, I still wondered: Is there a cultural motivation behind this Asian American youth movement? Part of the reason behind my fascination in this culture was learning of its continued popularity despite the news reports and public condemnation of drug-related deaths among young Asian Americans at events. How did the notion of PLUR permeate through the masses of unsuspecting first- and second-generation citizens? 
Although there haven’t been strong ethnographic studies regarding the resurgence of rave culture and its racial impact, some academics are beginning to shed light on this topic. In a thesis report, Harvard alumna Judy Soojin Park argues that cultural belonging has played a large role in the Asian American youth’s participation in rave events. 
As an Asian American myself, I believe there’s a much larger argument to be made about this entire movement — but Park’s reasoning is definitely a foundation for many of the underlying reasons why EDM and rave culture has manifested itself in today’s Asian American youth. One could point at the Second Summer of Love in Britain as a cultural parallel behind this 21st-century occurrence. During the late 1980s, the British rave movement exploded due to the influence of house and techno music in America, but more importantly, the cultural repression that British youth faced during the Margaret Thatcher era. The Second Summer of Love, which resulted in a massive boom in raves, represented a countermovement against Thatcher’s notion that “there is no such thing as society.” 
In the same vein, the Asian American youth here in Southern California have been mobilized by an invisible cultural current permeating through the masses of society, regardless of their nationalities. The labels placed upon us — the model minority, the perpetual foreigner, the overachiever — may all be part of this motivation, along with pressures and generation gaps within families. For us, raves have ultimately become safe spaces for those looking to escape their realities with others just like ourselves. And consequently, we’ve created a cultural community under one collective racial identity.
Regardless of how they are perceived in the media, I still see raves for what they truly are: gathering spaces for people to express themselves without judgment. And if this is what it takes for young Asian Americans to discover their voices in today’s society, I’m all in.

A New York Times article from last week asks, “Why are more American teenagers than ever suffering from severe anxiety?” And while millennials have heard this question before, the answer remains the same, for many of us enrolled in college.
In an age of new, consuming pressures from social media and increasing competitiveness in and out of the classroom, and struggles to grapple with rising student debt, the stakes and anxiety for millennials have never been higher.
The National Institute of Mental Health found anxiety to be the most common mental health disorder in the United States, with nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults affected, revealing a cross-country problem deeply embedded in our culture and society. In the age of social media, access to greater information and experiences and more awareness of the impact of mental health, anxiety has emerged on the agenda after decades of struggle.Anxiety emcompasses more than simple butterflies before a presentation or nerves prior to a social outing. It’s often a crippling condition that can render students, and adults, paralyzed by their own fears.
Though other pressing mental health challenges such as depression are now recognized as clinically diagnosable, the real struggle with anxiety lies in stigma and combating misleading narratives.
Anxiety is not confined to the hotbeds of hyper competitive coastal private schools. For example, thousands of adolescents suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from living in high-crime neighborhoods, with rates of PTSD found to be almost equal among residents of Atlanta as in war veterans. And according to The New York Times, “Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids.”
Second, anxiety does not represent a simple state of mind, but often a lifetime struggle that often entails prescription drugs, therapy and untold pain. With anxiety, the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” rhetoric falls flat for heart-wrenching stories and experiences of a generation.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
For Mental Health Awareness Month, the Academic Culture Assembly put up a canvas at McCarthy Quad asking students to detail their own experiences and struggles with mental health. A written symphony to the chaos of our minds soon followed, with notes and memories about fear, loneliness, struggle and suicide filling the page.
In recent years, anxiety has jumped to the forefront of campus dialogue. After years of trial and error, proposal after proposal and countless hours of research and advocacy, Undergraduate Student Government managed to pass a fall break through all legislative bodies. This break, which could be implemented as soon as the 2020-21 academic year, would fall in between weeks eight and 10 of the school year, when data from the Engemann Student Health Center shows a spike in stress levels and need for counseling. At a school with the most instructional days of all top-25 universities in the nation where the constant pressure to perform takes a toll on students, this break comes as a welcome relief.
But our efforts cannot stop there. We must continue these efforts to bring anxiety out of the shadows and into the light of our campus dialogue. And when students become comfortable enough to emerge from the shadows, the resources need to be there to support them in their time of need. The University desperately needs more counselors and institutional resources to combat the growing tide of anxiety, and students, families and the campus and community at large must rethink its priorities, approaches to and conceptions of mental health.
Growing up in the Silicon Valley, I watched as the area bred more than simply innovation — it bred a hyper-competitive culture where we grew inured with the daily stress of performing and even to rising suicides rates. Anxiety became the norm rather than the exception. But no school should have to place 24/7 guards at train stations to prevent the unthinkable. No community should have to see their youth suffering from PTSD. And no student’s mental health should ever be left behind.
It takes resolve, tough conversations and persistence to change the stigmatizing narrative surrounding anxiety, to mobilize resources and support and to continue and further a dialogue about mental health and well-being.

Ariel Heller sat up in bed when he read the original script for his Student Academy Award-winning thesis film last spring. Upon reading it, Heller knew then he had to bring the script to life. 
The script was written by alumnus Celia Rettenmaeier for a simulated studio-like production course, CTPR 546, Heller was in. It was originally titled “Blue Gatorade and Cheetos,” but over the course of the year, Heller and Rettenmaeier developed the script into Mammoth, a film following two brothers embarking on a journey to Mammoth Lakes after one discovers he is diagnosed with terminally ill cancer. 
With its compelling characters and visuals, Mammoth won a silver medal for best narrative film by a U.S. school for the Student Academy Awards. An alumnus of the USC Cinematic Arts program, Heller was one of two USC student recipient filmmakers awarded this season.
Heller recalled the developmental process for the film as streamlined and uncomplicated after sitting down with Rettenmaier. The original script could not be made in the production course because of its 12-minute time constraint, but the possibility of Rettenmaier’s script making it into Heller’s thesis film was a viable option. Rettenmaier agreed and Heller began adapting the script, then shooting the film in December 2016.
After receiving a bachelor’s degree in musical theater from Emerson College in Boston, Heller moved to New York City and began working as a stage actor in the Blue Man Group and the critically acclaimed Broadway play War Horse. In 2014, he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a master’s degree at USC.
Heller credits renowned filmmakers such as Alexander Payne, Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jones as an early influence on his writing and directing style. 
“The kind of humor and sensibility, and edge and tone that those guys get has always been what I’m after,” Heller said. “It comes in performance and complexities in relationships … mixed with the absurdity of life and how ridiculous things are and the ability to laugh at ourselves, feel pain and be vulnerable.”
The 22-minute film focuses on two brothers, played by Tad Cooley and Alex Hoeffler, grappling with themes of death, time and acceptance as one of them battles terminal cancer. Mammoth explores juxtaposing visuals and tone, with dark humor accompanied by vast seclusions of Northern California winter landscape.
Heller petitioned at USC to include his own brother Caleb Heller, an American Film Institute graduate, as director of photography for Mammoth.
The title of the film takes also on a double entendre, according to Heller. 
“[Mammoth is] not just the physical place, but the size of the decision, the size of the symbology of the biggest and last decision you’ll ever make,” Heller said.
As a director, Heller doesn’t shy away from political stances. He openly creates statements emphasizing “death with dignity” or the “right-to-die” laws for patients battling terminal illnesses.
“The reason why I was so compelled with the story is because death with dignity — as a cause in this country and a law — is one that had caught my eye a few years back,” Heller said. 
He specifically mentioned the controversial Brittany Maynard case, in which a 29-year-old woman decided to take her life after learning she had terminal brain cancer. The case propelled California to pass a law in June 2016, allowing individuals with a terminal diagnosis the right to physician-assisted suicide. 
Heller wanted to ensure Mammoth did not fall into the category of a soapbox film; he instead displays his point of view through the dynamic relationships of his characters.
“It’s an opportunity to shed a light on something through a real moment, through a real relationship, one that’s more nuanced and more complicated,” Heller said. “I hope that anyone who comes to see the film who might otherwise be skeptical or in opposition to that right, might walk away from this movie seeing value in affording people the privilege to be in control at the end.”
The Gathering cloud of broken promises covers the assisted suicide lobby.
Meanwhile all is not well in OR, WA, CO and
CA where reports on assisted suicide are incomplete: How many self-administered as promised and how many choices were dismissed.
A broken promise is revealed in the CA report on assisted suicides.
So after a year in CA how many self administered the poison as was promised when the concept was marketed? By omitting an ordinary witness all the flaunted safeguards are eviscerated and our choices are ignored and not honored allowing exploitation of us all.
State Documents in Oregon indicate that 20% of their assisted suicide deaths could have been bullied by the corporate facilitators forcing the poison. I take exception to the push polls yes 60%, even the religious, favor the concept then 95% change to not-in-favor after they learn how easily the laws can be wrongly administered saying “I’m not for that”. Risking us all,all ages, to be exploited by predatory corporations and predatory new best friends or heirs
Read the language of the laws to decern the double speak, omissions and commissions to reveal the normalized, ‪the exploited‬, the expended, the euthanized.

Devon Manney photographed by Natalie Ng | Daily Trojan
When alumnus Devon Manney stepped onstage to accept his student Academy Award in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, the gratitude poured out of him.
“No one makes a film in a vacuum,” Manney said. “And ‘Cradle’ is indebted to so many beautiful souls and talented artists that it really just makes me dizzy to think about it.” 
He went on to thank over a dozen people — his mentors, other artists and of course, the staff at USC’s Panda Express. That encounter encapsulates Manney as a student and a filmmaker — ferociously humble, gracious, with a profound appreciation for the menial. 
It’s almost as if he doesn’t recognize his own genius that culminated in a silver medal in Animation at the Student Academy Awards, the world’s most prestigious international film festival for college students that received over 1,500 entries and named just 15 winners. With his medal, Manney joins the ranks of previous Student Academy Award winners Spike Lee, Bob Saget and Robert Zemeckis.
Manney is fidgety: that much is clear from not just his acceptance speech, but from spending just 10 minutes with him. He has so much on his mind that he physically can’t sit still, even just for a moment.
It’s funny, then, that his 14-minute Student Academy Award-winning animated film, “Cradle,” moves so slowly. Set in a post-9/11 landscape, the film details an amputee’s return from the Iraq War in its early stages. Like many other veterans, he struggles to adjust to civilian life. He attempts to rekindle his relationship with his wife and learns how to parent his daughter. But on top of the typical barriers that amputees face, as a double amputee, he is afflicted with phantom limb pain. The film beautifully animates — in every sense of the word — the intense physical and emotional obstacles he faces as he fights for post-war normalcy. 
Manney latched onto the idea of phantom limbs in a high school psychology class. Something about the phenomenon stuck with him — the post-war metaphor of having the sensation that something is still attached, even if it is forever gone. That eventually made its way to a vague idea for “Cradle,” but it’s not until he started conducting research and interviewing amputees that he felt a duty to tell the story of phantom limb pain, because it was a story that hadn’t yet been told.
“Phantom limb pain, which affects a large percentage of amputees, is almost completely uncovered by any media representation,” Manney said. “I wanted to address the real kind of difficulty of what amputees have to go through on a  day-to-day basis — on an emotional level, on a physical level and on a neurological level with the phantom limbs.”
That goal has guided the past few years of his life. It started with his first semester at USC — Manney took an introduction to animation class with Professor Sheila Sofian, which showed him the possibilities of animation.
“It really forces you to hit the ground running in a way to say — there are so many things you can do with this medium, there is no limit to what you can do with animation and to what you can do with film,” Manney said. “The only limits are what you fail to imagine.”
Manney started developing the ideas for “Cradle” in his sophomore year. During his next year, he started writing and rewriting scripts, starting with one long enough for a feature film.
“He started with a much longer script,” said Sofian, who mentored Manney during his filmmaking process.
Sofian, alongside her husband David Fain, also a faculty member in the School of Cinematic Arts, helped Manney focus his script — to a whopping 14 minutes of animation in a single year. It’s a project that took a great deal of courage. 
“And stupidity,” Manney laughed. “There’s a lot of stupidity.”
And so, at the beginning of his senior year in 2016, working alongside a team of colorists, a sound designer and a composer, he started the diligent process of animating 14 minutes of film. 
“I spent somewhere between 12 and 16 hours on average at my cubicle, every day making small incremental progress — day in and day out, trying to tell this story and trying to keep focused on what this character was feeling,” Manney said. “For nine months, that was my life.”
Throughout the grueling process, Manney credits his friends, family and mentors for cheering him on along the way. USC’s animation faculty, in particular, provided him invaluable advice and support. 
“Almost every faculty member inside the animation program at some point helped me out on a huge level with  this film,” Manney said. “It owes an insane amount of gratitude to them for sticking with me and this project throughout that process — just constantly telling me that just keep going, keep going, keep going.”
Manney’s many thanks don’t end with the animation faculty. “Cradle,” he maintains, could not have been done in any other school besides the School of Cinematic Arts, which provided him crucial opportunity.
 “They just wouldn’t have given you the creative freedom and support to do a project this crazy, and short-sighted at times, and long, and ambitious, and different,” Manney said.
Now that the project is over, there’s a sense that he almost misses the three-year process of bringing Cradle to life — the painstaking, second-by-second animation, the composition of a harmonious score and the realization of a grand vision.
“‘Cradle’ was my life, and it was my world, and then the film … you know,” Manney’s voice trailed off.
It’s the hallmark of every brilliant filmmaker — someone who is so in love with their craft that the process of creation becomes a part of them. And so, coming off the heels of graduation in May, Manney is looking for his next big, creative project.
“It’s kind of a deep, wide ocean that I’m slowly diving back into, but for me that’s really exciting,” Manney said. “I like being in the middle of nowhere and having to try to find something to just grab onto and hang on for dear life — for a couple months, a couple years.”
There’s no telling what Manney will do next. Because at 22 years old, he won an Oscar.
Manney laughed. He didn’t want to inflate his ego, “A student Oscar.”
Congrats, Devon.  Just a word of advice: keep your hands out of your pockets, especially when someone is photographing you.
