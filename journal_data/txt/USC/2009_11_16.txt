The holiday season is almost upon us, and that means love is soon to be in the air. Expect repeat screenings of romantic Christmas movies designed to make you pine for someone to share hot chocolate with by the fire. And because of the inevitable desperation that comes with the closing of yet another year, expect your standards to drop and your patience to wither.
Forget meeting the opposite sex in bars, coffee shops or on the Row — there is an easier way to find Mr. or Ms. Right Now. It’s online dating, and, as much as you hate those TV commercials, it’s not as terrible as you think.
Just as the Internet offers a solution to almost every other one of my problems, it’s making being single a lot more entertaining. Online dating is quick, private and, surprisingly, fun. But as you may have noticed, not all dating websites are created equal. There are hundreds of networks out there, ranging from traditional matchmakers to special interest sites to genuine porn.
How do you choose which to register at? The same way you find love in the real world: trial and error.
Lots of dating sites pride themselves on their ability to “read your mind” and pair you with your soulmate. Certain sites, however, achieve this ESP by making you take questionnaires longer than your midterms to find your perfect match, culminating in a detailed analysis of your personal and relationship style.
Answering questions like, “On a scale of one to seven, how important do you think it is to take time and smell the roses?” may seem tedious, but sitting through eHarmony’s extended personality test can give you a (free!) spot-on character breakdown.
Sometimes, it’s even weirder — Chemistry.com, the website whose commercials claim to help those rejected from other dating sites, begins its personality test by asking you to describe your right hand.
And Match.com, eHarmony’s biggest competitor, is quite the opposite. All it takes is an email address and a bit of personal info to get started, and initial matches are based mostly on your location. But don’t count on them being good looking either — that only happens once you pay the subscription fee.
One of the best things about online dating is there is no pressure to take it seriously. In fact, it’s hard not to laugh at the concept of digital love when sites exist solely to pair “beautiful women and successful men.” The site is called Diamond Daddy and, as if the concept weren’t absurd enough, users are asked to list their “best physical charactoristics [sic].”
The Internet is a big place, and thus other special interest sites with more politically correct goals do exist. JDate is a place for Jewish singles to congregate, and upon registering, users get to specify their religious commitment — or willingness to convert — and kosher preferences before browsing potential lovers.
Say one day you quit creating fake profiles and actually manage to find the love of your life. The in-person meeting is the next step, and although online dating has been generally proven safe, protecting yourself is still a concern.
When meeting SmileyGuy012 in person, you should exercise caution: find each other in a public place, don’t let him or her pick you up, and, because some people are just plain twisted, be wary about leaving your food or drink unattended. Bear in mind that if your dream date refuses to talk on the phone or provides inconsistent information, he or she may be more of a nightmare.
If you are unsure about using the web to foster a relationship, don’t stress. Chances are your potential partner is just as skeptical about the system, and he also doesn’t want his body to wind up in a trash can the next day. While I can’t promise you won’t die of awkwardness, your risk will likely pay off — a Science Daily study found that 94 percent of couples who had been talking through email and then met in person went on to see each other again.
One thing that remains unappealing about online dating is its monetary cost, as paying a monthly fee to find true love is quite the downer. Just keep in mind that love is greater than money, and write something just as romantic on your profile — the ladies will eat that stuff up.

A piece of plastic.
It could be anything on the outside: black with funky doodles, gray with blue clouds and batting eyelashes, plain white peppered with lazy scrawls or simply an eye-popping pink.
But the inside always remained the same: 90 minutes of unassuming magnetic tape that managed to become the soundtrack to the lives of a whole generation of teens. Nothing could compare to capturing those fresh ambitions, sweet loves and heartbreaks on a brand new cassette, letting the dulcet tones of The Velvet Underground, The Magnetic Fields and Joan Jett immortalize and express so explicitly what couldn’t be said with just words.
Cassette From My Ex, a compilation book of mixtapes and the stories behind them, gives the modern-day reader a glimpse back into the heyday of an ’80s and ’90s rock ‘n’ roll scene and romance.
Jason Bitner, editor of the critically-acclaimed LaPorte, Indiana and co-creator of FOUND Magazine — a project that specializes in collecting unearthed notes and letters — brings readers Cassette From My Ex in an attempt to reintroduce the lost era of mixtapes. Like so many of his projects, the compilation is about capturing the feelings of a fleeting moment onto something tangible.
“[Now] so much of our communication is digital, and there are far fewer physical messages sent,” Bitner said. “Cassettes are largely obsolete now, and I just can’t imagine that we’ll put out an ‘iTunes Playlist From My Ex’ in 20 years.”
While infusing readers of the digital age with nostalgia for the days of analog media, Bitner and his contributors introduced the importance of the human “voice” and the makings behind a mix.
“Cassette From My Ex is a storytelling project based [around] love and music. Music can trigger so many memories, and the handmade artwork on mixtapes can do the same,” Bitner said. “We love hearing stories about being young and crushed out on someone, and these cassettes are a great way to conjure these tales.”
With kitschy scrapbook-style art from cover to cover, Cassette From My Ex reads like a note from a best friend — unpretentious, casual and full of surprises. Each essay brings something new to the table and anyone who appreciates music will find something to treasure in this collection of rock ‘n’ roll and alternative memorabilia.
For those with less cultured repertoires that don’t delve into funky Norwegian rock or Spanish fairytales, well-known bands and songs such as Nirvana’s “Oh, the Guilt,” R.E.M.’s “S. Central Rain (I’m Sorry)” and Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here” are also included.
Reading from Cassette From My Ex is often interactive, with regular “a-ha” moments at the nuances and perfect pairings of songs with the experiences shared by contributors like Jancee Dunn, former Rolling Stone writer and MTV2 vee-jay, and Claudia Gonson, pianist/drummer/backing vocalist for The Magnetic Fields.
With stories ranging in tone from the nonchalantly sweet and comical to the poignant and touching, Cassette From My Ex reads like a celebration of relationships and the great music behind them.
Although none of the stories have the typical fairy tale ending, they all avoid the expected carousel of misery and woe-is-me feeling of most breakup narratives. They instead opt for remembering the best of times and learnt lessons.
Some highlights and favorite pieces include “Ribbed … For Her Pleasure” by Rick Moody and Stacey Richter, which includes a comical exchange about an ideal mixtape; “Ken’s Corner” by David Greenberger, about the life and death of an endearing cassette critic; and “40 oz. to Freedom Mix” by Sara Strahan, detailing an unfolding romance between friends. Each story includes a corresponding tracklist and the original mixtape can be listened to online at www.cassettefrommyex.com, giving readers the chance to be there visually and auditorily for these captured moments.
“Everyone loved making tapes, and even better, receiving a tape. If someone made you a mixtape, you knew they were into you. It was the perfect medium to send messages,” Bitner said.
With Cassette From My Ex as the guide, those mixtape messages have been received. Regardless of age or interest, readers will find a story that resonates with them and reveals something new about love and music.

With 6:37 remaining in the fourth quarter, Stanford scored its seventh touchdown of the game to take a demanding 48-21 lead over the Trojans that all but assured a victory.
That’s when Cardinal coach Jim Harbaugh decided to go for a two-point conversion attempt that would give his team an even 50 points against the Trojans’ once-daunting defense.
Deal breaker · Pete Carroll questioned Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh about his surprising decision to go for two late in the game, sources said. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
The play was stuffed at the line of scrimmage, but USC players and coaches were still upset. It appeared as though Stanford was trying to show the Trojans up on its home turf.
After the game, USC coach Pete Carroll met Harbaugh at midfield to shake his hand, and, according to sources near the exchange, the conversation went as follows:
“What’s your deal? What’s your deal?” Carroll asked.
“What’s your deal?” Harbaugh replied.
And the conversation ended.
USC senior safety Taylor Mays refused to comment about the two-point conversion attempt but was seen walking toward Stanford’s bench and glaring at Harbaugh immediately following the play.
After the game, both coaches tried to downplay the two-point attempt for the media.
“I thought it was an opportunity, the way we were coming off the ball, the way our players were playing — that it was the right thing to do,” Harbaugh said.
When asked about the play, Carroll responded, “I’m wondering just like you.
“In that situation, they get to do whatever they want. Sometimes, you make the decision for your own team’s sake.”
Really, MaxTrojan?  I mean, really?  I thought your comments were part of some performance art piece, but now I’m starting to think that you are really serious.  Is this the kind of thug mentality bred into students and fans over at ‘SC?
I think the fans should be asking PC “What’s your deal”?  With undoubtedly one of the best recruiting and talent pools in the nation, why didn’t the Trojans even look competitive against Stanford?
Stanford had its day, and now they lost to CAL, a team which USC slaughtered. These things even out. Harbaugh acted the part of jerk. USC will be right there again next year. Stanford is nothing and will be nothing in the college football universe. Harbaugh will take his act to Michigan at some point,and the Stanford tree will dance around in a tizzy just as their band does. I was delighted they lost to Cal. Fame is fleeting, huh, Mr. Harbaugh.
Thank you Stanford for finally bringing this point up! What Goes Around Comes Around PC!!!
What was Harbaugh’s deal? The scoreboard.
Go daily trojan, it’s funny how you complain with a myopic opinion of Jim Harbaugh’s 2 pt conversion, yet you fail to see how SC ran the scores in the high 60 ranges with other schools in the past. Or how USC loves to do cheap onside kicks to weaker teams coming into the Coliseum.  I have also witnessed plenty of cheap late hits and deliberate helmet-to-helmet hits from SC’s safeties in the past.  And I’m not talking about the taylor “thug” mays hit on that Penn State player in the Rose Bowl.  I’ve seen other hard hits to other football players visiting the Coliseum in teh past.  What goes around comes around. This is good karma to pete carroll.  Also good karma for him being a dick to Norm Chow and booting him out of his coaching team because Chow was getting all the credit in the past, not pete boy.
Philly Cardinal, you’re so right on the money about USC’s “academic excellence” being a big misnomer.  As a matter of fact, I attended USC for the first two years of my undergraduate career before transferring to NWU because I just could not stand the boisterour, rowdy and unfriendly students in my dormitory at SC.  They would come home drunk, puke all over the hallways, place trash in front of my dorm room door, etc. I had it with these “trojans”.  Lived in Marks Tower then lived in the unit near the VKC dining hall.  Still the same crap the second year. The guys next to me would blast their music like jerks, turn their TV volume up at night so I couldn’t sleep, etc.  USC’s “academic excellence” is totally over-rated compared to the likes of Stanford, Cornell, NWU, and even UCLA.
Rich, don’t even base your opnion of a school on the US news college ranking.  Sc is notorious for tweaking the incoming class’ SAT/ACT scores just to look better than UCLA or some other colleges ranked in the 40s.  While SC has climbed a bit over the past few years in terms of improvement, there is still a LONG WAY to go before SC becomes a real academic powerhouse like Stanford, the Ivy leages, the UC’s and my alma mater NWU.
Trojanmax, wow, you are really off your medication or what?! You want to severely injure Stanfords football players all because of the 2 pt conversion attempt?  You know, the Trojans always had things their way from 2002 up until this year.  All their way with cheap on-side kicks against weaker teams that played in the Coliseum (i.e. Washington State this year, Hawaii back in 2003) as well as excessive celebration on the sideline (i.e. 2009 Rosebowl VS Penn State) without getting penalized for it.  How about that face mask penalty from taylor “thug” mays against James Rodgers this year?
anyhow, college football is college football. Same for NFL football.  You have to work hard to score points, and you have to work hard to prevent the other team from scoring points.  So what if Jim Harbaugh wanted to do a 2 pt conversion?  If the trojans didn’t want that to happen, then work your butts off to prevent that from happening!
What goes around come around. If pete carroll cannot take it like a man, he shouldn’t dish off pain and suffering by being a jerk to other football programs that visit the LA Coliseum.
Both of my brothers-in-law went to Stanford. So did my mother-in law. My father-in-law, now deceased, was also a professor there for many years.
I am therefore very used to the Northern California  “Stanford arrogance”.  After attending Saturday’s game, that arrogance reached new heights, not only with Harbaugh’s two point conversion attempt with a 27 point lead, but also the tasteless and totally classless half-time show by the Stanford band and its repeated references to ONE former alumnus ( I was waiting to have them mention O.J. as well, but they were fixated on Francis). Granted, the Stanford band has a reputation for irreverence and I have seen them perform many times. However, this time they clearly overstepped the boundaries of common decency on USC’s Homecoming Day with many families and small children in attendance.
Needless to say, my husband’s family was embarrassed on Saturday for their alma mater.
Where Stanford goes from here, who knows. But on Saturday, they somehow managed to make themselves look like amateurs out there amid a studly effort. Reminds me of the kid who goes around the dorm showing off a hickey when he finally got laid. Embarrassing, especially for an athletic program that was once among the country’s elite.
PhillyCardinal – USC is ranked in the top 30 University’s in the country, and is about a 10th of a point behind stanford in incoming freshman gpa. and our students have actually kissed a member of the opposite gender. stop being a loser.
Be real. SC is improving academically, but they are not even close to Stanford or UCLA for that matter. Whole different league, but hopefully with the next Pres after Sample leaves they will continue to improve.
PC has run up the score…but he did it with back ups, and he would have never gone for a 2 pt conversion in a  blow out. thats little jimmy taking running up the score to the next level. Stanford will have good seasons here and there, but will not be able to sustain a team every year that can beat USC. little Jimmy will lose this battle in the end…and he will look stupid. I for one am not worried….everyone goes through down times…and i say if a team can run it up on us, then have at it. but you will pay as you will see little jimmy pay. He is stupid to get into this personal battle with PC.
FIGHT ON!!
Yes Alex,
A team of revenge and hearts of fury for payback.
All teams play for payback. Line backers that put a hurting on people every Saturday and scare them ..YES !!
 We had them last year, check it out man. and NO, Coach Carroll has never gone for a 2 point conversion in the 4th at 48 to 21. Are you insane..lol
YOU know something I don’t??
Show me specifically where he ever did that and then ran his mouth all cocky at the end of the game in the face of another coach “Whats your deal?”
and NO, he did not deserve that and I resent you saying but after 7 years, he may have needed that. wake up call.
HI Doug,
heard and understand. Maybe my statement in that regard sounded a little over  the top and a little harsher then I intended. lol…I am miffed with the way and manner Harbaugh chose to conduct himself  in behavior and comment acheiving a dominating win which is every bit his job and right. Something he could have achieved without…..we can all agree………..I will retract such confessed pleasures then in light of your point.
However, when we do play them again and if in the coarse of clean Trojan fury (meaning legal hits), some may need “assistance” like Penn State’s Elwood did in last season’s Rose Bowl, Letssay there is nothing wrong with that and I keep my comments regarding those specific issues to myself…. lol
……………….and maybe somebody can “accidentally”knock a Stanford RB out of bounds into Jimmy boy….(??) …lol
Ok Doug, thanks for your comments
Go USC
hey maxtrojan…”Coach Carroll would have never done that.”  maybe you should go back and look at game film from the last 5-7 years.  He deserved it.  Apparently he can’t take a dose of his own medicine.  Also, why are you talking like you’re about to lead your knights into battle at medieval times?  “please build us a team back of rage and revenge that will crush our enemies. Get us Linebackers that destroy lives .”  really?!?
My point was that you shouldn’t be wishing injury to your opponents…ever. It’s a game, and if you want your team to run up the score on Stanford next year, go for it. However, if you want your team to injure and maim young men over a 2-point conversion, then you have serious issues.
no apologies to you Doug. Call me immature all you want.  We need to start playing bone crushing football that scares teams and be  real mean about it. You don’t let a coach come in YOUR house, smack talk YOUR coach, disrespect him to his face and let him just  walk off. Thats plain cowardly.
In MANY stadiums in the SEC and Harbaugh would have done that,…. he would have been attacked by a mob of fans.You think LSU fans would put up with that?? LOL..HOT CHICKS in Baton Rouge  drunk on Bourbon would have given him a black eye!!….. Why do you think Saban has 10 troopers holding hands in a circle around him on road games?? ….  . You get to win by as much as you earn and he did earn that win. We must take our beating with a smile because thats the way it goes in CFB  but the mouth and comments to my coach acted upon by a two point jab attempt?…… no sir. I’ll  take that  as personal like my coach does.
and Doug, …just because I take my beatings as fair like I do  does not mean that I don’t get to hold that aganist my opponents in the future and hate them for it wanting revenge. Thats CFB too. I want to see us play Stanford in the future with such clean fury, their players are carried off the field. Don’t be afraid to be a man for your team.
Unlike here for many (not all), CFB is a religion with NO equal in sight in half this country. They are raised this way.  How do you even hope to compete with programs with a mentality like that if you do not atleast know that. They are not a SHALLOW form of entertainment for band wagoners who bail when it doesn’t feel good anymore.  and right now, this team and this coach needs more than that. I will continue to wish the worst for those aganist my team.
You might want to think about that.
GO USC
Wow….Maxtrojan’s a real mature one isn’t he? Hospital beds? It’s a game you psycho. Go take your meds.
Oh this is rich! USC fans talking about class! They’ve run up the score countless times in the past, and the lack of discipline they show on the sidelines when they’re way ahead is unacceptable. When you’re up 40 you should be dancing and talking to the cameras. That’s showing up your opponent, and I can’t understand how a team that has done this since Pete Carroll took over can question the class of another team.
Quit whining, Trojans. Read all the articles of the sports announcers. They all agree that PC has a track record of running up scores and showing no respect for his opponents. These are people who watch the games and know. So quit your whining…what goes around comes around!!!
GO STANFORD. And next year I hope they do the same.
Mike.. nothing at Stanford will ever be associated with thug type behavior.  The same cannot be said for USC.  For all the talk of USC rising in academic standing, it has a LONG way to go before it reaches the level of schools like Stanford.  Also, the Stanford admissions office really does have say on the admission of athletes.  The same cannot be said of USC.
I think that we were all counting on having Sanchez.
His leaving threw a wrench into the whole year.
If we’d had him, we’d be facing a bcs comp. The frosh would have had a chance to be ready for NEXT year.
I think Pete rocks and has taken the loss graciously.
I’ve never seen him run up the score in the past. He does not throw, he uses the second /third string etc
In fairness, I thought the Stanford QB played very well.
On to next year, we will win 13-0
Brenda
HI Greg,
I don’t agree that PC is vindictive and disrespectable like Jim Harbaugh is. They are two totally different kind of people and carry themselves and talk to other people completely different…….. and I for one am not whining. I just want revenge. REVENGE with blood……. I want his players in hospital beds and him too….pretty simple.
Sooner or later, we WILL have it.
I am a Chicago USC fan and I can tell you when Harbaugh left the Bears he scored a touchdown in a pre-season game I belive it was with the Colts.  Little Jimmy made it a point to run by the Bears bench and put his arms out like he was an airplane or jet or bird, who knows.  Standford’s victory was tainted by their classlesss asshat punk coach.  Fight On Forever.
Little Jimmy, come on what is with the insults. Harbaugh has bitch-slapped Petey and his gangsta thugs twice now in their own house. You should address him King Jimmy ruler of Troy.
maxtrojan. I can also tell you that pete carroll himself has disrespected other coaches and other football teams that played in the Coliseum in teh past and during the most recent season.  Talk about that Arkansas game where he ran the score up to 70 pts. Then like Johnny said, he decided to do a nasty onside kick to Washington State who were underdogs, and also down by 20 pts in the FIRST quarter.  pete carroll also decided to pull this sh-t on Hawaii back in Sept 2003 when SC was up by 35 pts.
Before you guys whine and gripe about Harbaugh “disrespecting” your trojan team, please, take a look in the mirror and see what kind of crap you people have done to other football programs.
noone should care about this. once the score got out of control in the 4th qtr…who cares. We have issued to fix on defense, and we shouldnt be worried about little jim running up the score.
Next year, Make these people pay Coach Carroll and make it cost them EVERYTHING….. EVERYTHING !!
MAKE THEM REMEMBER.
GO USC !!!!
I tell you this. That is the 2nd time Harbaugh has disrespected Coach Carroll in two years. Coach Carroll would have never done that. I hope this is a wake up call for our beloved Coach Carroll. This guy hates you coach and wants to humilate you over and over again and has. Do you still want to be the super nice guy you truly are?
 I hear they have bill boards up in the Bay area with Harbaugh pointing his finger saying ” Whats your deal?” .lol…… If so, PC should put one just like it in his office staring at him in the face.
 We will never forgot and I hope Coach Carroll will lead this Trojan team on a RAMPAGE OF REVENGE that respects no one in the next year or two it takes to build this team back up.
Coach Carroll, YOU build it and we will come.  You have led and designed a CFB record setting 7 year reign. The most successful active coach in CFB. You have made the Trojans feared
Now sir, please build us a team back of rage and revenge that will crush our enemies. Get us Linebackers that destroy lives ! We will be right behind you
Look, big deal. Cry me a river. In the past, Pete Carroll was unrelenting on other smaller/weakers teams that came to the coliseum to play USC.  Like I’ve posted in another DT article, why doesn’t pete carroll ask himself about the cheap onside kick against Washington State earlier this year? Yeah, USC up by what? 20 points at that time in the 1st qtr and the trojans want to recover their own ball? This was also no big nasty Wazzu team. They were 25-pt. underdogs in that game at the Coliseum. I have observed PC over the whole course of his career at SC and he has been really really arrogant. I also recall PC doing another cheap onside kick against Hawaii back in Sept 2003 at the Coliseum. I believe USC was up by 40 points against a meager Hawaii team, and PC decided to do a cheap onside kick against the Bows. I recall this game as I saw an infuriated June Jones (now at SMU) yelling at the refs and giving PC stink eyes. From what I recall, PC also gave JJ the runarounds when it came to sending out video tapes to the Hawaii team for them to preview. Other people at other message board talk about the 70-16 trumping of Arkansas that PC did. How much class is that?
Overall, I’m happy that Jim Harbaugh did that 2-pt conversion attempt to HUMBLE pete carroll.  He has been very arrogant and cocky to other Pac-10 football coaches. Not to mention how he threw several F-bombs at former Oregon headcoach Mike Belotti at one of the games.
Now that the table is turned, pete carroll now understands how it feels like to have rocks and stones thrown at you.
Jim Harbaugh just took one of the most respected schools in the nation and reduced it’s football program to a thug school. By going for two points he proved that he doesn’t belong at the school.
Will the AD sit him down and explain to him what that school is about? Probably not.
Johnny,
The difference in each case has to do with context.
I admittedly do not remember the Hawaii game, but it sounds as if your recollection is vague also.
With regard to Arkansas it’s important to remember that the late scores were executed by 2nd and yes, third team scrubs. Michael McDonald threw the last TD at Arkansas when the game was well in hand. If I remember correctly, he may have checked out of it into an audible.
There’s simply a major, major difference between having your starting team do something like this and your 2nd or 3rd string. in your examples, this wasn’t Bush and leinart or for that matter John David Booty. it was Michael McDonalds’ only TD of the year I believe.
You simply cannot compare these two examples.
In almost all the cases I can remember, it was not a starting unit that scored
and if you know anything about Sports and especially football, you don’t ask these guys to give everything in practice and then ask them NOT to score.
It is widely and generally accepted in football that you insert 2nd or 3rd string late in games when it is almost done. You also generally never throw the ball. It’s extremely common and widely accepted that you run the ball. You cannot ask your players to not play hard or to lie down.
If you don’t understand this you don’t know anything about football.
now- If you can show me a specific example of Pete running up the score at the end of a game I’d like to see it. And btw, kicking an onside kick in the middle of the game is not construed as running it up.

The rich just got richer.
USC’s golf coach Chris Zambri said Monday that Jeffrey Kang and Ramsey Sahyoun signed letters of intent to play with USC. Both are among the top-rated high school golfers in the country.
“We are thrilled to have two phenomenal people and players coming to USC,” Zambri told usctrojans.com.
According to Golfweek magazine, Kang is the No. 1-ranked high school golfer in the country. He is also a 2009 Rolex Junior All-American First Teamer and a 2008 Rolex All-American second teamer.
Kang, who attends Sunny Hills High in Fullerton, Calif., was among four players who represented the United States at the Toyota Junior Golf World Cup in June. He helped guide the United States to a second-place finish and was the top US finisher.
Kang also posted top five finishes in 2008 at the Polo Junior Classic, Junior PGA, HP Junior, Rolex Tournament of Champions and Dixie Amateur. He led Sunny Hills to the CIF-CGA State High School Golf Championship, earning medalist honors. Earlier this year, he tied for eighth at the HP Junior and won the 2009 West Junior Open.
Sahyoun of Campbell Hall High in Van Nuys, Calif., is the 13th-ranked high school golfer in the country, according to Golfweek magazine. He won the 2009 36-hole US Junior Amateur Championship qualifying tournament. At the Emerson Junior Classic, he placed fourth out of 53 players and at the 59th LA Junior Golf Championship, Sahyoun placed in the top five out of 174 players.
Zambri is already looking forward to what Kang and Sahyoun can contribute to next year’s team.
“They will add so much in so many ways to our goal of winning national championships,” he said.

Without stepping foot on a court for a game in nearly eight months, the USC men’s basketball team made headlines around the country.
But starting tonight, the Trojans can put all of the chaos and tumult of the offseason behind them and finally turn their attention to basketball, when they open their season against UC Riverside at the Galen Center.
On his shoulders · If the Trojans hope to continue any of their recent success, it will start with senior guard Dwight Lewis. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
Debuting tonight will be a USC team that has experienced tremendous turnover and will bring an almost entirely new look and feel to the court this season.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill, who took over the program after Tim Floyd resigned in mid-June, oversaw the drastic change the Trojan squad experienced in the interim months — all while trying to get to know the program inside and out on the fly.
“I’m just learning our team really,” O’Neill said at Pac-10 Media Day.
Trojan fans may have some trouble figuring out the new team as well, since most of the core of the 2008-09 team is no longer suiting up for the Trojans.
Included in those losses was nearly 70 percent of the team’s scoring, including point guard Daniel Hackett — who is now playing professionally in Italy — and forwards DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson, who were both selected in the first round of the NBA Draft.
Replacing the production lost from those three starters is of the utmost concern to O’Neill. It is a task he knows will be directly related to the success of this raw Trojan team.
Much of that expectation for offense production will fall on senior and lone returning starter guard Dwight Lewis — not only the Trojans’ go-to option on offense, but the de facto team leader.
“As [Lewis] goes, we’ll go. He has the experience, and I think he’ll be a leader,” O’Neill said. “When you’ve lost a recruiting class and three guys to the pros, you’re counting on your returners.”
Lewis doesn’t seem fazed by the expectation.
“I welcome the pressure,” he said.
Expected to replace Hackett at point guard will be redshirt junior Donte Smith. Smith will have some help from backups redshirt junior Ryan Wetherell and redshirt senior Mike Gerrity, although Gerrity will sit out until Christmas because of eligibility requirements.
Also among the new faces the Trojans will be relying on this year is redshirt junior transfer Alex Stepheson. After sitting out last season following his transfer from North Carolina, the power forward will be counted on to produce down low to replace some of the low post threat lost when two-time Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year Gibson left for the NBA.
Because of the year Stepheson missed when he transferred, the Southern California native hasn’t experienced regular season action since his days with the Tar Heels. Even then, Stepheson was only a factor off the bench for UNC.
“[Stepheson] is an NBA-type rebounder and has a great body, but he needs playing time,” O’Neill said. “He’s worked really hard this summer to develop his skills, and he competes hard.”
Stepheson will be joined in the frontcourt by three returning forwards: sophomore Leonard Washington, redshirt junior Kasey Cunningham and sophomore Nikola Vucevic.
Washington must also sit out until the second semester because of academic issues, but once he returns, the frontcourt could be the strongest part of this inexperienced Trojan team.
“We have some good players on our team that feel they have something to prove,” O’Neill said.
One of the players with the most to prove may be junior guard Marcus Simmons. At 6 feet 6 inches tall, Simmons can play in a variety of sets and may be the Trojans’ most versatile player. How Simmons is used tonight may be a window into the third-year’s role going on into the regular season.
UC Riverside (0-1) presents the Trojans with an opportunity to even their record in home openers at the Galen Center, but the Highlanders will not be an easy first opponent for the Trojans.
UC Riverside features a balanced attack, that led the team to a 17-13 record last season in the Big West conference, and will also bring former Trojan forward Kyle Austin back to the Galen Center. Austin played for the Trojans during their run to the Sweet 16 in 2007 before transferring to Riverside.
Beyond tonight’s game, no one is giving the Trojans much of a chance to make it far this season. USC, last season’s Pac-10 Tournament champions, are being picked to finish ninth in the conference.
“I’m not sitting around and lamenting the players we have, we’ve got good players,” O’Neill said. “We don’t feel like a ninth-place team.”

The horde of recruits had to be confused. Maybe everyone had mistakenly entered the wrong locker room.
No, this had to be it. There were USC logos and colors plastered everywhere, but this was a far cry from the fun-loving, raucous atmosphere that they had heard so much about.
This subdued scene wasn’t what the potential future Trojans had envisioned ­­— not that anyone had reason to suspect a party following Saturday’s embarrassment against Stanford.
Mixed signals · Taylor Mays and the USC defense looked spectacular in the first five games, but have not been able to remain consistent. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
But as players and coaches floated around, it was undeniable that everyone was looking at a program in crisis.
The postgame locker room usually feels like a grand reunion. On Saturday, everyone languished as though there had been a death in the family.
“I’m not of a clear mind right now,” USC coach Pete Carroll said with a blank expression. “I’m not really sure how to deal with this.”
Indeed, the Trojans are in a land largely foreign to them. In the past three weeks, the Trojans have been outscored 111-55 by their opponents. They have gone from national championship outsiders to potential Sun Bowl invitees in less than a month.
Nearly every streak or staple of the program once thought to be invincible has wilted and died this year. There will be no eighth Pac-10 title, no BCS bowl, no top-five finish.
“To be a senior and leave a legacy like this is sickening,” said senior safety Taylor Mays, who was expected to be the face of the Trojans this year.
This team’s legacy is still undetermined with two games left, but more history is being etched into stone with each loss. But the key to salvaging what’s left of the season may be determining what the team’s true identity is.
Carroll’s previous teams all had clear images of themselves that were reinforced by their performances on the field. Last year’s USC squad was perhaps the best example — an aggressive defense that, save for one game, repeatedly willed the team to victory regardless of circumstance.
Trying to get a hold of the identity of the 2009 Trojans has been more difficult than tallying all the records set against them.
It appeared at first as though the legacy of defensive units capable of carrying the Trojans as far as they needed to go would remain. At one point in the middle of the season, the defense was actually outpacing last year’s unit in almost every statistical category.
But those days seem so far off now that it feels almost like a different era.
The Trojans defense has been so maligned that it may become the eventual story of the season. The game against Notre Dame may be the hinge on which the season turned, as USC gave up its first (but certainly not last) touchdown pass of the season.
From that point on, the Trojans’ offense frequently had to keep pace with the other team in frantic shootouts. And when it stumbled, things turned ugly.
It made everyone wonder what happened to the defense and team we thought we knew.
“I think we know who we want to be and who we represent,” Mays said. “We just have to find it, because this isn’t us.”
He could have fooled me. Whatever the Trojans see themselves as, an entirely different picture is appearing on the field.
The Trojans’ confused identity also applies to freshman quarterback Matt Barkley, whom fans were eager to make the face of the team since he was named the starter. Carroll was just as culpable in parading Barkley around, saying at one point that Barkley was playing as well as any quarterback that had recently come through USC.
The act of pigskin hubris drew puzzled looks at the time and now seems so ridiculous that it is hardly worth examining. Barkley has embraced the position and all it entails to the best of his ability, but he remains a freshman quarterback playing at the highest level of college football.
If a team has to take all of its cues from someone still finding his own way, it will falter more than once.
“This isn’t what we’ve really grown up watching,” Barkley said after Saturday’s game.
Barkley has not even been in the program for a full season but can already tell something is amiss with the team’s identity. For so long, USC’s image was derived from winning.
Now, it will have to establish something outside of that formula.
With two regular season games and a bowl game remaining, USC has the chance to right the ship to the best of its abilities. If it does, the salvaging effort may be the team’s legacy, which hardly seems appealing to players accustomed to Rose Bowls and conference championships.
But better to have an imperfect identity than none at all.

With time winding down late in the second half at the Galen Center, sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath figured it was time she made a play.
“I felt like I hadn’t played good all game,” Gilbreath said. “I just needed to help my team out in some possible way and that was kind of my time.”
Breath-away layup · Briana Gilbreath stole a pass and went the length of a court for a breakaway score to put USC on top for good. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
Gilbreath gave the Women of Troy the edge by stealing a pass in the backcourt and taking it the length of the court for the go-ahead layup.
“They got sloppy with the ball so I just went out there and took it,” she said. “It was a major play for us.”
The steal and score capped a furious rally for USC that culminated in a 68-63 win over Fresno State on Sunday. The victory was the first of the season for the Women of Troy, who lost their season opener to No. 11 Xavier on Friday.
Gilbreath led the Women of Troy with 17 points and seven rebounds. Fellow sophomore guard Ashley Corral struggled from the field but chipped in 10 points and seven assists.
USC coach Michael Cooper was pleased with the resolve his team showed against a tough early season opponent.
“Fresno State is obviously a tournament team,” Cooper said. “To come here and give us all we could handle was a testament to how good they are.”
Despite shooting poorly all evening, the Women of Troy were able to overcome a 32-19 halftime deficit thanks to some increased defensive pressure. Cooper said the team did a better job of keying in on the Fresno State shooters after halftime, which forced the Bulldogs into contested shots.
“One of the things we wanted to do was run them off that 3-point line,” he said. “They got up 30 [3-point] attempts but a lot of them were forced.”
USC trailed 55-48 late in the second half before scoring 13 unanswered points. A baseline 3-pointer by senior guard Heather Oliver pushed the USC lead to six with four minutes remaining. USC held Fresno State scoreless for almost six minutes during that span.
The Bulldogs roared back, going on a quick 5-0 run to cut the deficit to 61-60. Fresno State tied the game at 63 before Gilbreath put it away for good.
Freshman forward Christina Marinacci provided a spark off the bench for the Women of Troy, grabbing six offensive rebounds and scoring 11 points.
“You just want to look to be aggressive and crash the boards on offense,” Marinacci said. “Especially when you have a height advantage like we did against this team.”
Junior center Kari LaPlante added 12 points and six rebounds for the Women of Troy. Juniors Jaleesa Ross and Hayley Munro led the Bulldogs with 22 and 21 points, respectively.
The Women of Troy fell 81-71 in overtime to Xavier on Friday, despite a career-high 25 points from Corral and 19 points and three steals from Gilbreath. On Sunday, USC was able to overcome an off night from Corral to secure its first victory.
“Our team is not built around one person having to score 25 every night,” Cooper said after Sunday’s game. “Other people stepped up [today] and played extremely well. Getting four players in double figures is always a good sign.”
USC now heads north to Spokane, Wash., to take on Gonzaga Thursday night.

If Charles Dickens were writing today, he might have taken the easy way out and sent Scrooge to the Pantages Theatre for a heart-warming showing of Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical, which opened Saturday. It wouldn’t be much of a story, but at least Scrooge would be cured of his misanthropy and Christmas time ill will without the invocation of supernatural phenomena.
But then again, were Dickens writing today, we might not have a Grinch to begin with, let alone Dr. Seuss’ own recreation of Dickens’ famously infamous protagonist/antagonist. Literarily speaking, if Scrooge had a son (and mated with a lime-green she-cat), the result would no doubt be our Grinch — a one-of-a-kind creature out to rid the world of cheer.
Whoville · Stéfan Karl (left) stars as the hideous and bitter title character in Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. The musical adaptation, which also features Kayley Stalling as Cindy Lou Who, runs now until Jan. 3. - Photo courtesy of Broadway LA
Here, potbellied and covered in stringy, moldy hair (Robert Morgan makes some real magic with these costumes), the Grinch is played to perfection by a captivating Stéfan Karl, who frequently breaks the fourth wall in his comical interaction with the crowd. As it should be, Karl — even when it’s only his scraggly extremities reaching out from behind stage walls — steals the show, almost literally in “One of a Kind,” his big solo.
People who had childhoods all know the story, but for those pitiable exceptions whose shelters were rocks, a summary: In his self-imposed isolation atop Mount Crumpit, overlooking the nauseatingly cheery Whoville, the congenitally un-merry Grinch cooks up an evil plot to steal Christmas, the bane of his sorry existence, from the Whos. The Grinch’s only companion is his unloved dog Max (an endearing James Royce Edwards) that is made to aid in his master’s comical villainy.
Of course, all it takes is the friendship of a cute child to enlarge his small heart. Tiny Kayley Stalling’s Cindy Lou Who (alternating here with Issadora Tulalian) is almost unbearably precious. She sings like a cherub, and it’s no wonder the Grinch is reduced to tears after her “Santa for a Day.”
Other notable cast members include five-time Emmy Award-winner John Larroquette, who narrates the play as the older version of Max. Melinda Gilb is a real hoot as Mama Who.
The musical numbers are all similarly charming, especially “It’s the Thought that Counts,” a wonderful send-up of the commercialization of Christmas (the Grinch’s falsetto solo at the end was the best 30 seconds of the night, and that’s saying something).
Kids probably won’t get Dr. Seuss’ veiled critique, but they won’t need to. The story is classic, the performances certainly creditable and the show, thanks largely to Gregory Meeh’s special effects and John Lee Beatty’s stylized sets (based on Dr. Seuss’ sketchbook illustrations), a beauteous marvel to behold.
And at a brisk 90 minutes, there isn’t the moment-killing bustle and shuffle of parents leading their whiny children to the restrooms — well, it isn’t as bad as normal.
The risk with overproducing a show like this — and make no mistake, this is Broadway-style overproduction at its finest — is that we lose a sense of intimacy. Magically, that isn’t the case here. Karl singles out audience members to poke fun at or scare, and a few surprises with confetti turn the Pantages into a winter wonderland that pulls us all inescapably in. Kiddie fare shouldn’t be this good, but it’s a pleasure when it is.
There really isn’t much of a point to indulge in Scrooge-like bah humbuggery. Sure, the narrative stops and starts at times, and the ending may be slightly abrupt, but petty complaints detract from the sheer pleasure of watching this show. For those who haven’t felt the onset of the winter season quite yet — or for those who wish to thaw cold, stony hearts — Dr. Seuss has an answer.
At one point, the two Maxes lead the audience in a sing-along to “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.” It’s then, when you open your mouth to sing, that you realize you’ve been smiling the whole time.

Music may be the universal language, but dance has many dialects.
On Sunday, the USC Chamber Ballet Company invited five on-campus dance troupes to Bovard Auditorium to showcase everything from break dancing to creative interpretations to Björk songs, creating a collection of movement you don’t often see in one place.
En pointe ·  Members of the USC Chamber Ballet Company perform at the first “Dialects of Dance” concert in Bovard last Sunday. The company hosted the event, which also featured hip hop, Chinese and Latin groups. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
“We knew we couldn’t handle a show all on our own, so we decided to ask other groups who were probably in the same position,” said sophomore and co-director Diana Smith of the chosen performers. “It would be a great way to bring the whole dance community together and put on a show that really highlighted the diversity of dance here at USC.”
That they did, exposing those in attendance to a number of different cultures and clubs using various styles of dance of a form of expression.
The show began with a number that included every dance group, each clad in purple, showcasing their own unique style. Initially, the variety was a lot to handle — contemporary Latin performers and traditional Chinese dancers don’t often share a stage. Once past the shock factor, the troupes’ differences meshed well, and the diversity played out through the next hour to make USC Chamber Ballet Company’s first  “Dialects of Dance” a success.
Following the opening number, the first group to perform was the ballerines, who strutted on pointe shoes to “Big Spender.” The song encouraged liveliness and a roaring ’20s tone, both of which the group brought in full force.
“This show was really open, and we didn’t have a strict theme, so it was an opportunity for our choreographers and dancers to do something they’ve always wanted to do,” Smith said when asked about the troupe’s nontraditional song choice.
The Chamber Ballet Company continued to demonstrate the fruitions of its hard work by balancing en pointe to unexpected tunes such as “The Circle of Life,” managing to get into character beyond simply the choreography.
In between the pirouettes and bourees were lively numbers by the invited guest performers, including Traditional Chinese Dance, which kept it wholesome and, appropriately, traditional with its “Dance of the Peacocks.”
Then, a duo from Break on 2: Latin Fusion brought an overtly sexual element to the stage. They balanced the dance, which channeled Romeo & Juliet, with a talented singer who almost stole the whole show. The juxtaposition of the Latin and Chinese elements was surprising and contradictory, but made for a fuller display of each piece individually.
The oceans were calm and cultural, and no one was prepared for the hip-hop groups to steal the show as quickly as they did. Chaotic 3 consists of 29 people, and each brought so much heat it was as if their sneakers were on fire. The piece had attitude, and dancers moved to a unique mix of Beyonce, the Postal Service and gangster rap.
The audience was shaken up (in a good way), but was not too unsettled to regain its footing. They had bounced from classical ballet to Alosus’s interpretive-style modern dance to Björk’s “Who Is It (Bell Choir Remix).” Although these transitions were a bit confusing at first, the viewers adjusted themselves, and now they craved something different after each act.
Ask and they shall receive. Suddenly, a cloud of smoke appeared, and break dancer group Vanguard stood on stage. The group performed a mock-battle to a remix of “Canon in D Minor,” further contradicting audience conceptions of dance norms.
It was during this break dance set that the sheer craziness of the project became clear. The audience was somewhat shocked to learn that fellow students could move like that, or even that such diverse art forms existed on campus. The show brought together fans of various dance styles, and everyone in attendance saw something they likely would not have caught elsewhere.
“Dance is more than just ballet,” Smith said. “I think we showed that.”
The show culminated with the host company’s performance of a ballet piece set to the theme to Requiem for a Dream, and its choreography was just the right balance of epic and dark to conclude such a diverse, interesting and surprising show.
But the ballerinas couldn’t have done it without their guest dancers, demonstrating to the crowd at Bovard that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
Congrats Ballet Co. on another great show! Thanks for inviting us!!
YEAH DIZZY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We see it all the time.
A sleep-deprived student walks into class after a very late night, clutching a hot cup of coffee or an energy drink as his only hope for winning the tough struggle he is about to face — fighting off sleep.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
With dark, heavy bags under his eyes, the student begins to flutter is eyelids, and his head begins to droop. It seems like he is going to lose this struggle, but suddenly he perks his head up, quickly realizing he was a hair’s length away from giving in.
After an hour more of fighting the urge to doze, the student slowly walks out of the classroom. He won the war against sleep, but lost the ability to take anything meaningful away from the class.
“It’s almost like watching a drama unfolding. I see how [sleep-deprived] students valiantly fight to stay awake in class. It’s a battle between the desire to sleep and the desire to stay awake and pay attention,” said Robert English, a USC professor of international relations.
It’s obvious that many students today are sleep-deprived. An October survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that only 28 percent of college students reported getting sufficient sleep at night.
This can amount to a decrease in academic performance and overall health. Ultimately, the administration, not just the students, need to address the problem of sleep deprivation.
With Leavey Library full of students throughout the night studying for upcoming midterms and writing papers before the sun comes up, homework is one of the main explanations students give for sleep deprivation.
The copious amounts of reading and need to understand important concepts take up time usually intended for sleep.
“A lot of the material takes a long time to understand. It is one thing to just read it, but it’s another thing to understand it,” said Sukhveer Sandhu, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering.
Some students may end up enduring all-nighters because of procrastination and a lack of proper time management.
With so many distractions constantly surrounding students — whether it’s friends, parties, cell phones or computers — students will almost never be in a situation where a potential diversion does not exist.
These distractions, combined with poor time management, usually lead to long nights and sleep deprivation.
Professors are able to tell when a student is struggling to stay awake in class. The constant yawning and the clear display of a lack of concentration are dead giveaways to most professors.
In smaller classes a student who is struggling to stay awake can potentially be a class distraction and take away from the learning of others, as well as impairing the professor’s ability to concentrate and teach effectively.
“For many, this is an entirely new environment, and they will need practice to balance everything,” said Daniel Durbin, a USC professor of communication. “A professor definitely notices when a student is trying not to doze off. Sometimes it is a distraction to everyone including me, and I may respond to it, but other times it is better to concentrate on the subject being discussed.”
Other professors point to the similarity between students and professors in terms of their jobs and environments.
“As long as the [sleep-deprived] student is not hindering the learning experience of others, I don’t really react to it  …  Professors are working around the clock too. We’re constantly in meetings and we’re making presentations at various seminars which results in staying up late working,” English said. “Sometimes some of the subjects we’re listening too in such seminars may not be as interesting as we thought and sleep begins to catch up with us as well.”
Although fighting sleep in class is a big challenge for students, doctors point out that sleep deprivation may have larger health consequences.
Constant sleep deprivation over time can lead to a higher risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.
Although each individual needs different amounts of sleep to function, an average adult is expected to get between seven and nine hours of sleep, and anything less than six hours of sleep per night causes risk factors to rise.
“We’re shifting to a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week society, and as a result we’re increasingly not sleeping like we used to,” said Najib T. Ayas, an expert in sleep disorders from the University of British Columbia in an interview with the Washington Post. “We’re really only now starting to understand how that is affecting health, and it appears to be significant.”
To address sleep deprivation on campus, the university must take a two-fold approach.
First, a campus-wide initiative must be made by the university to educate and promote the potential detrimental health effects stemming from sleep deprivation.
This initiative should focus on educating the student population on how important sleep is for their bodies.
Second, the university should hold more time-management seminars in which strategies are taught on how to be time efficient and thus increase the time students have to sleep.
Although the university offers a plethora of orientation seminars for incoming freshman, few students have any opportunity in the next four years to get valuable advice and tips on time management.
As of now, most students do not put sleep high up on their list of priorities. Many see it as something that must be sacrificed or curtailed in favor of academics.
This relaxed perception of sleep must be changed in order for students to consider sleep deprivation more seriously.
We all want to sleep. We all need to sleep.
Let’s try to shift our priority lists and give importance to sleeping more hours.
Trust me, you won’t regret it.
Angad Singh is a sophomore majoring in international relations and communications.

Recognizing differences
We, the USC Interfaith Council, are a group of students from many different religious backgrounds and traditions that come together weekly for interfaith dialogue and collaboration. As representatives of the rich religious diversity of our campus, we are committed to helping nurture a campus environment in which all students — of all religions and of none at all — feel safe and comfortable.
As we mourn the lives lost at Fort Hood,, we feel the need to express our concern about the nature of the media coverage and discussions surrounding the tragedy, which have largely focused on the Muslim faith of the shooter. This tone in the public discourse has affected our campus and national climate. We have become aware of recent incidents on campus in which our fellow Muslim students (and non-Muslims) have been taunted and hassled.
As a group committed to interfaith understanding and cooperation, we must affirm that religious discrimination is just as unacceptable as racism, sexism and homophobia, and we ask the USC community to live up to the ideals of our university and take a stand against religious discrimination and intolerance in any form.
No student should feel threatened or unsafe because of his or her appearance, clothing, ethnicity or religion.
When Islamophobia, anti-Semitism or any other type of religious prejudice presents itself on our campus, it should not be the burden of the targeted group to defend itself, but the responsibility of the entire faith and campus community to stand together — Christian and Hindu, Muslim and Jew, Sikh and atheist, Baha’i and Buddhist — to denounce religious discrimination and violence and cultivate instead a campus atmosphere that fosters religious expression and interfaith collaboration.
Please join us on Tuesday, Nov. 17 at 5 p.m. at the United University Church for a multi-faith memorial service for the lives that were lost at Fort Hood.

Recuperation of Troy 
Seriously? The fall of Troy? Wow. I honestly could not help but laugh at the headline in Monday’s Daily Trojan. A three-loss season at the end of a seven-year run of unprecedented success is certainly no reason to sound the alarms and call for an end to Troy’s reign. After all, it’s not like USC didn’t lose eight or nine players to the NFL, one to a freak accident in the weight room and several others to typical football-related injuries — but who’s making excuses?
Still, I can’t help but be surprised at how quickly everyone is ending the Trojans’ dynasty. Take for example LSU, a school that has won two BCS titles during USC reign. In the same span of seven years, LSU has had two seasons where they lost three games, one season where they lost four games, and even one season (2002) where they lost five games. I don’t hear anyone in Baton Rouge calling for the program to be disbanded.
In 2007, the Florida Gators went 9-4. They seem to have recovered from that, right?
So, as I sit here composing this letter, I can’t help but feel a bit comforted in knowing that many of the great college football dynasties of our time have taken their share of hits. A true dynasty endures, and I for one am anxious to see just how the Men of Troy respond to the program’s first true obstacle in almost a decade.
If you can, please remind all of those bandwagon ’SC fans (and there are many), about the history of USC’s nickname. In case you don’t remember:
Until 1912, USC students were referred to as the Fighting Methodists. During a track and field meet against Stanford (of all teams), the USC team was beaten early, much like it was on Saturday. After the first few events, it became clear that it was statistically impossible for USC to win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events. After this contest, sportswriter Owen Bird reported that the USC athletes “fought on like Trojans,” and the president of the university at the time, a man by the name of Bovard, approved the name officially.
I urge you to keep this in mind, my friends and fellow Trojans — the king is not dead, just a little humbled. Does anyone know what happens when you humble a king? If I was the Pac-10, I’d enjoy this moment. I think Virgil’s quote on Tommy Trojan says it best:
“Here are provided seats of meditative joy, where shall rise again the destined reign of Troy.”
Fight On (notice that it’s Fight, not Fought).
Martin Jauregui
Graduate student, education
“I don’t hear anyone in Baton Rouge calling for the program to be disbanded.”
Oh really? Maybe you should have visited the New Orleans area during one those three-loss seasons, which you obviously did not. The conversations I heard in my aunt’s art gallery about LSU were not at all pretty.
Also, who exactly called for Troy to be disbanded?
The fact of the matter is USC has NEVER in its history given up 55 points. NEVER. Until Saturday. USC has NEVER in its history lost by 34 points at home. NEVER.
That’s not a momentary dip or part of a routine ho-hum periodical ten-year cycle that all teams have. This loss was unprecedented. As in, a loss of its magnitude has never before happened in SC’s 100+ year history. No, it does not mean USC will never recover. But, yes, unfortunately it is cause for raised eyebrows and rung alarms.

USC frequently touts the fact that it enrolls the most international students out of any other American institution.
And for the eighth year, the university has done it again.
According to the annual Open Doors report released today by the Institute of International Education, 7,482 international students attended the university in the 2008-2009 academic year.
New York University came in second place, with 6,761 students, and Columbia University in third, with 6,685 students.
The next California school on the list was UCLA, which came in eighth place with 5,590 international students.
USC also set two records in terms of enrollments by country. There are 1,623 Indian students at USC — the largest segment of the university’s international population. Students from China make up the second-largest group of international students at USC, at 1,428.
According to an article posted on USC’s website, officials said the university’s reputation on the Pacific Rim and an expanding alumni base in China and Indian that increases recruiting efforts helps USC attract high levels of students from these two countries.
“USC has long been a leader in attracting international students from all corners of the globe,” said C. L. Max Nikias, executive vice president and provost, in the article. “These students bring a wide range of ideas and beliefs to our campuses, as well as an abundance of intelligence and creativity. Not only do they benefit from their experience at USC, but they offer our domestic students a rich resource for teaching and learning.”
The survey also showed that the number of international students at about 3,000 institutions in the United States rose 8 percent from last year, setting a new record of 671,616 students.
