USG Community Affairs has planned a monthly gathering at the USC Community House, where students can sit down with neighborhood leaders and talk about the surrounding L.A. area.

USC’s Community House has a full-time staff, some of whom live in the house and coordinate USC and community relations. The USG-proposed monthly gatherings will discuss topics such as transportation and exchange programs with surrounding schools.
“Their goal is to help organizations and give them the tools to carry out their events,” said Marissa Srour, director of Community Affairs. “It’s a fantastic resource for organizations that need help connecting with community leaders.”
In the past, there has been minimal student involvement; the USC Community House mostly interacted with administrators. This year, however, the monthly meetings are intended to be both informative and interactive. Srour said they are opening up the house more this year because, in the past, students were not familiar with it as a resource.
“It’s great to actually show students their surrounding community,” Srour said. “It’s really important to really connect them and use that resource. We want to increase awareness about this great community house and this great organization.”
In the beginning of the year, a community tour was held by the local government for freshmen to see the surrounding community as well as the campus.
This was the first time the tour was held and the tour bus was filled beyond capacity, so Srour said she expects a similar outcome for the monthly gatherings.
Srour said she expects the monthly gatherings to begin at the end of the semester.

The California Transportation Foundation elected James E. Moore II, a professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering, to its board of directors this month as the first appointment of an academic member to the board.

The CTF, a non-profit benefit corporation founded in 1988, focuses on fulfilling California’s transportation needs that are not met by state-run programs.
Moore said his appointment distinguishes USC as a university dedicated to research and professionalism.
“CTF is largely oriented toward professionals rather than academics, and for us to be able to place a faculty member on that board, it’s an implicit endorsement of the attention that USC gives to professions that it serves,” Moore said.
The foundation increased its focus on education in an effort to strike a balance between the professional and academic aspects of transportation, said Heinz Heckeroth, executive director of the CTF. Offering Moore a spot on the board strengthened its educational abilities, Heckeroth said.
“We provide scholarships and mentoring programs, so we felt that Moore would be helpful in terms of understanding student requirements and student needs,” Heckeroth said.
Moore has been a faculty member at Viterbi since 1988 and serves as chair of the Daniel J. Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.
“I was a little skeptical initially because the board tends to be more oriented towards professional personnel rather than academic personnel, but it was clear that they had a very deep respect for the education enterprise,” Moore said.
As a scholar in the field of transportation research, Moore plans to further the cause of transportation education while serving his three-year term on the CTF board.
The foundation hosts an annual symposium for undergraduate students of civil engineering and urban planning, in which Moore was heavily involved before his election. USC typically sends three students under Moore’s direction to the symposium, where they work with leading experts on mock transportation projects.
“There’s a special degree of attention at USC and our professional schools to making sure that our work and our educational programs meet the needs of professions as those needs emerge and change,” he said.
In addition to the undergraduate student symposium, the CTF also hosts an annual conference on California transportation policy, sponsors agency personnel to attend other conferences and scientific meetings, and organizes an annual competition to award and recognize the state’s top transportation projects and officials.
“I think the foundation does important work and it contributes in a significant way to transportation scholarship,” Moore said. “I wanted to be able to participate and support them and to try to keep the resources of that foundation oriented towards serving universities.”
Moore believes USC is at the forefront of universities involved in transportation research.
“We’ve always been oriented toward research — we want to do good scholarship and contribute to literature and move the frontier of knowledge ahead,” Moore said.  “But in addition to that we’re also very interested in remaining relevant to the professions we’re serving.”
His election to the CTF board of directors, Moore said, reflects favorably on the university as a whole.
“The message I get is that USC is seen as a research institution that takes the professions we serve very seriously,” Moore said. “We’re able to bring the full strength of the institution to transportation problems and questions.”

Sixteen Interfraternity Council chapters have been banned from all social activities in chapter houses after the Department of Public Safety cited the chapters for unauthorized parties Monday night.
In addition, eight students were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning after showing signs of shaking and unconsciousness, according to USC Student Activities officials. Some of those transported to the hospital were underage female students who recently joined a sorority, officials said.
“Clearly, this behavior is unacceptable for any recognized student organization and detrimental for any values based fraternity and sorority,” wrote the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development in a letter to the USC Greek community.
All social activities, including planned and informal or spontaneous events, are forbidden until the 16 cited chapters meet with Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards.
“I feel very disappointed in the breakdown of the risk-management policies,” said Parker Adams, IFC’s vice president for public relations. “This is a good opportunity for us to step back and re-analyze our safety policies.”
Some students said they believe more people attended parties on The Row than usual because Monday night marked the first night after the completion of fraternity and sorority rush. Students are discouraged from attending parties during the rush process by the fraternity and sorority houses.
“It was really the first night that all the freshmen were out on The Row,” said Adam Laufer, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering. “There were definitely bunches of people walking up and down the sidewalks … more than a typical Thursday night.”
In the letter, the Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development stated that it plans to notify all national parent organizations of the chapters where alcohol poisoning occurred. The university plans to enforce any sanctions the national organizations place on USC chapters.
In a few weeks, all new members of fraternity and sorority chapters will attend retreats where DPS will speak about alcohol awareness — one measure that IFC has already planned to prevent incidents like those that occurred Monday.
“The safety of our community is always number one,” Adams said.
Patrick,
Good call on noting how many of these incidents were attributed to Row parties.
IFC isn’t to blame when their member fraternities get in trouble.  The 13 IFC Officers should always anticipate nights when risk management will be tougher and provide more support and coaching to the fraternities but you can’t expect them to be able to take responsibility for problems.  Besides, there are only 13 officers on IFC and the most fraternity members are hostile to their presence during party nights in the first place so there is only so much they can do.
This article forgot to mention that while there were 8 incidences of alchohol poisoning, only half of those were direclty connected to the parties held on the row. It is unfair to assume all 8 incidences were the direct result of the fraternity system. Additionally, it is unfair of the IFC to not allow parties on the first night after moratorium as social events are an integral part of the fraternal system. It is only human of the fraternities to have parties that first night as they were not allowed to for the previous week. IFC should have had the foresight to prepare for the amount of social events that night, regardless of whether they are registered or not. IFC should not hide behind the fact that these parties were not registered. It is apparent that IFC is using the the fact that the parties were unregistered as a scapegoat in order to prevent the blame from falling upon them.

Scandal, sanctions and uncertainty.
These are the labels Thursday night’s ESPN broadcasters will use to try to convince you that No. 14 USC’s season will not go so smoothly.
Although stories of controversy, instability and turmoil make for a catchy headline, an entertaining talking point during introductions or a time-filler in case the Warriors fail to show up for their primetime billing, they frankly miss the mark.
If you want a real story — the type that transcends the playing field and forces you to re-evaluate your own perspective on the daily toils of college life — look no further than the remarkable account of freshman cornerback Nickell Robey, a story built on the foundation of love, tragedy, wisdom and commitment.
On Feb. 2 — a day buried by the hype of big-name recruits such as freshman tailback Dillon Baxter and freshmen wide receivers Kyle Prater and Markeith Ambles — a 5-foot-8, 165-pound defensive back from Frostproof, Fla., signed his letter of intent to become a USC Trojan.
But before the ink had time to dry on Robey’s letter, the four-star recruit was dealt the challenge of a lifetime.
Though the Frostproof High School standout’s decision to come to USC was not met with the hoopla and grandiose publicity of the aforementioned crop of talent received, in a town of about 3,000 people, Robey’s cross-country trek didn’t just represent an individual opportunity or a chance to achieve national acclaim, but an unbinding promise between a mother and her child — a promise to follow the heart.
If ever there were a backbone in the budding career of Robey, it was, without question, his mother, Maxine.
From attending daily practices to cooking and cleaning for teammates to helping coaches plan team functions, Maxine Robey was, as her son puts it, “an all-purpose Mom.”
Although she was beloved by friends and teammates for her unyielding warmth and benevolence, it was the wisdom she bestowed upon her eldest child that, to this day, still resonates.
“My mom was just a loving person,“ Robey said. “What comes out of me from her is pretty much the wisdom part — being smart, using my head. She always taught me to make good choices.”
And when it came time for the No. 18-ranked high school cornerback in the nation to make his decision about where he would be taking his talents, Maxine didn’t mince her words when suggesting her son follow his California dream.
“I can remember when I was sitting in the living room, and I was just asking her ‘Mom what do you think I should do?’” Robey said. “She was like, ‘I can’t speak for any of the other colleges, but I know any school where Monte Kiffin and Lane Kiffin are at — and they told me they’d take care of you — I would go with them, because those are some great people.’”
Yet just days after he followed his mother’s advice, the newest member of the Trojan Family tragically lost the person who gave him that guidance.
In what can only be described as one of life’s cruel twists of fate, days after the Robey family informed Lane Kiffin and co. that their son would be attending USC, Maxine — Robey’s mother, mentor and moral compass — suddenly passed away of a massive heart attack.
For an adolescent, the idea of losing a parent is crippling. It is the type of moment that can define you, and in many circumstances, destroy the very existence you thought you had.
In the months that followed Maxine’s untimely death, Robey was forced to shed his label as an incredible athletic talent, and instead learned to cope with a new role: the man of the house.
“I feel like this is one of the tests that made me become more of a man, and had me thinking more about the responsibilities of a man,” Robey said. “You either go up or down and I just skyrocketed up. It boosted me. It strengthened my determination, it strengthened my confidence and also in terms of being just a more mindful person.”
In my mind, the word skyrocket doesn’t nearly do him the justice he deserves.
Despite losing his biggest supporter nearly eight months ago, Robey never waivered on his decision to fulfill his letter of intent — a choice that should be unanimously met with adoration from the entire student body.
Many athletes faced with similar circumstances would have likely asked out of their contractual obligation citing family issues, and no one would have questioned their motives.
For Robey, however, honoring his commitment to USC was more than a binding agreement to the university — it was a promise to his mother. It was a chance to celebrate her memory by following the path the two had always envisioned for him.
Since setting foot on campus, however, Robey hasn’t just honored his mother’s legacy; he has built upon it.
Through an uncommon source of motivation and an unflappable resolve, Robey’s maturation process — from an All-State football star to a promising collegiate phenom — can be seen through the grace in his stride, the compassion in his voice, the devotion to the game in his eyes and, most noticeable of all, the appreciation in his heart.
It is an appreciation, though subtle in nature, that extends well beyond his triumphs between the white lines these past few months. It can’t be fully understood simply by appreciating his capacity to make adjustments on the fly in an intricate Tampa 2 system, or watching him at 18 years of age handle the monotony of media interviews with the utmost professionalism — a rare quality for a young man who has far more important things on his mind.
No, this appreciation goes much deeper.
It is the reflection of a child’s everlasting affection for the woman who helped make him who he is today, and the remembrance he has courageously tried to maintain even in times of great strife and anguish.
“I write ‘Mom’ on my right wrist before I go out to the field,” Robey said. “I just look at it, and it just makes me appreciate my opportunity; it makes me go hard. I get really teary-eyed and riled up. She’s impacted my life a lot, and she’s done it well.”
In our entertainment-enthralled society, exploits of a son’s undying love for his mother often get overlooked. They lack the shock-and-awe value of an NFL franchise suing a college coach or traditional powerhouses seemingly marred by NCAA violations.
But what makes the story of Nickell Robey so applause-worthy is that the freshman cornerback doesn’t need to achieve a single athletic feat during his time at USC for us to all sit back and feel immense pride that he is a fellow Trojan.
While there remains a collective resignation that sports are most fascinating when conflict and salaciousness exists, Robey’s down-but-not-out tale illustrates the illuminating power of renewal and strength of character.
“In the end, it’s great what happened,” Robey said confidently. “Things happen for a reason, and I still don’t know the reason right now, but I am going to keep moving on and we will just see at the end.”
But when Robey’s time as a Trojan comes to an end, regardless of whether he’s accrued any All-Pac-10 accolades or whispers of a Heisman candidacy, he will still hold a title we should all be so fortunate to obtain: an all-purpose person.
It is a title that would surely make Maxine Robey beam from ear to ear.

Eight months and five days since its last game, the USC football team flew to Hawaii Tuesday night to prepare for its season opener Thursday. Taking into account all the negative news the team has received and change it has undergone during the off-season, eight months seemed like an eternity to some players.
“We’ve all waited a long time for this,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “It seems like the offseason was two years long.”
The Trojans held a final walkthrough Tuesday afternoon before getting on the plane. That practice concluded a two-week preparation experience for the team, and coach Lane Kiffin can understand if players’ minds were already in Hawaii during yesterday’s practice.
“I think that we started this thing so early,” Kiffin said. “Last week we went through a whole Hawai’i week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday practices — and we did it again this week so this was their second Thursday practice in a row. They weren’t right [last week], they were very comfortable and weren’t very crisp. That’s how you get beat.”
For Kiffin, pretty much the only thing that he has yet to see for the season opener is the opponent, but this has only contributed to his excitement about stepping on the field as USC’s head coach.
“I’m most excited to get it going,” Kiffin said. “It’s kind of different than I pictured it because of everything we’ve gone through since [I accepted the job] but it’s a lot of relief.”
For the players, this ends one of the most mentally tough camps they have been a part of. Because of the limited numbers on the team, Kiffin and his staff tightly controlled the physical aspect of fall camp and instead gave the players a lot more time in the weight and media rooms.
“This was definitely mentally tougher than last year,” Barkley said. “We didn’t do as much hitting or running as last year but the mental load challenged a lot of guys, and I think it was really important to building us as a team.”
Barkley said the team watched Matt Leinart’s performance against Hawai’i when the Trojans won 63-17 in 2005 and gained some tips from that. But because USC hasn’t had much full-speed game experience this year, the Trojans hope they can execute everything on the field that they haven’t been able to during camp because of small numbers.
“Some of the question marks revolve around just playing well: tackling on defense, not turning the ball over on offense and not trying to do too much because of anticipation that this game is finally here,” Kiffin said.
Barkley has repeatedly stated that this is a business trip. He believes the team is prepared for this game and is confident his teammates won’t get distracted in Hawaii.
“I’m confident they’ll have their heads down and not do anything crazy,” Barkley said. “We’re on a pretty tight schedule. Friday will be the time to celebrate after the game.”

A lot of words have been thrown around on this campus in response to the NCAA sanctions on the USC football program. Devastating, disheartening and crushing, to name a few.
And from a fan’s perspective, the sanctions are all of that. Nothing for Trojans to root for, except ruining other teams’ seasons.
But are the sanctions devastating and disheartening enough to stop fans from attending the games?
Staying together · Trojan fans have remained loyal through tough times, continuing to purchase tickets and support USC despite the recent NCAA sanctions. Concerns over football ticket sales stemmed from reduced sales for the men’s basketball team after it’s self-imposed punishment in 2009. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The magnitude of this question should not go unnoticed. As Jonathan Kendrick wrote in his column last Friday, the USC athletic department has an annual budget of about $80 million. In the fiscal year in which these numbers were taken (2008-2009), the football program turned the athletic department a $35-million gross profit and a $14-million net profit. Despite the $21 million in expenses, it was the only sport to finish in the black.
That means the financial viability of literally every other USC sport is tied to football. If football doesn’t turn a substantial profit, other sports will suffer as a result.
And though some of football’s tremendous revenue comes from game broadcasts and donations, a large percentage is from ticket sales. A loss of sales would not only be harmful to the football program but to all of Trojan athletics.
In light of all the turmoil and trouble USC football has seen in the last year, one could see how a potentially devastating loss of ticket sales is possible. But has it happened?
According to USC Ticket Office Director Debra Duncan, in a word, no.
“There hasn’t really been much of a change [in ticket sales] so far this year,” Duncan said.
She believes the primary reason for this is the attitude of the Trojan fans.
“Our fans are very loyal. They’re not going to stop supporting their team because of one bump in the road,” she said.
That sentiment was echoed by many. Almost without fail, every student who was asked why they still bought season football tickets in the wake of the sanctions responded with some form of the phrase, “Football is football.”
“It’s the culture here,” said Will Blair, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering.
L.A. native, longtime Trojan supporter and current freshman computer science and business administration major Curtis Speed went so far as to say that the team “could be playing one game the whole year and I’d still buy the tickets.”
For others, the football game is simply background.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love my Trojans,” said Josh Gonzalez, a junior majoring in psychology. “But it’s the atmosphere the game creates that you really can’t miss.”
Some students, however, don’t see it that way.
“I love football,” said Calvin Chung, a freshman majoring in computer science. “Trojan football was one of the major reasons I chose to come to USC. But I don’t want to pay to watch meaningless games.”
Chung’s viewpoint is not a common one.
“We’re right on track with our student ticket sales,” Duncan said. “We’ve been selling right around 12,000 every season and we’re certainly on pace to be right around there this season as well.”
Duncan also said there has been no drop-off in alumni and booster sales. And although loyalty is certainly the largest factor here as well, she admits most fans renewed their season tickets before the sanctions were announced.
“We actually have issued a few [sanction-related] refunds,” Duncan said. “But as I said before, our fans are tremendously loyal.”
She pointed out, however, that if fans don’t renew their season tickets, they lose the seating preference.
The one area where the ticket office has experienced a loss in sales is in single-game tickets.
“In the past, we would sell out entire seasons,” Duncan said. “In recent years, we’ve had as many as 1,000 tickets available on the day of a game. That’s not a lot in an 80,000-seat venue, but it’s still more than we’re accustomed to.”
But Duncan believes this is not related to the sanctions.
“We started experiencing this well before there was even any talk of sanctions,” Duncan said.
She instead attributed the loss of sales to the economy and the fact that the team has not been quite as successful in recent years as it was in the mid-2000s.
Duncan brought up that when the basketball team was doing well last year, sales went up tremendously. However, when the university put self-imposed sanctions on the program, including a one year postseason ban, sales fell rapidly.
“The basketball sanctions may have had an impact,” Duncan said. “Not in season tickets, but in single-game (tickets).”
But football remains king at USC.
“There is absolutely nothing like Saturdays in the fall,” 2007 alumna Alexa Maremaa said.
And although the team might not have anything to play for beside pride, that’s all the fans need to root them on.
Perhaps Dan Kasang, a senior majoring in environmental studies, said it best:
“I love football. I love the Trojans. They’re gonna kick ass like always, and I’m gonna love watching it.”
Our family are loyal Trojans. We’ve supported the football program through good and bad. These sanctions don’t change the traditions that have been built for so many years. In fact, we bought another pair of season tickets. FIGHT ON!

Marriage: there is nothing easy about it. Merging two lives, two souls, two histories successfully — it is one of the most difficult things two people can do. Getting to the altar is the easy part, but even in getting to that point, chance and fate have a funny way of intervening.
Yes, that oh-so-dynamic duo once more makes its presence known, this time in the beautiful and enjoyable South African romantic comedy White Wedding.
It tells the story of Elvis (Kenneth Nkosi) and his fiancee Ayanda (Zandie Msutwana), a couple only a few days away from getting married. They are young and very much in love, but there is one obstacle: Elvis and his best man Tumi (Rapulana Seiphemo) must make the 1,000-mile trek from Johannesburg to Cape Town. This seems simple enough, especially to Ayanda, but then again this is a romantic comedy, where uneventful 1,000-mile treks through the South African countryside are simply bad for business.
Things go awry from the beginning. Elvis misses his bus at the airport and Tumi’s girlfriend finds him in bed with the, um, “entertainment” from the previous night’s bachelor party. Thus, the stage is set for a colorful cast of characters to enter each of their lives, who at once challenge their preconceptions and reaffirm their deepest beliefs.
There is Rose (Jodie Whittaker), the pretty, recently unengaged English doctor; Tony (Mbulelo Grootboom), Ayanda’s ex-lover, handsome, rich, and fresh from the United States; Fanie van Zyl (Marcel Van Heerden), the alcoholic South African ex-priest; and the merry gang of Afrikaners who manage to set aside the prejudices of apartheid to help Elvis, Tumi and Rose.
The performances on the whole are superb. Whittaker displays a wonderful sense of comedic timing and turns what could be a whiny, unsympathetic character into one that is truly heartwarming.
The leads, Nkosi and Seiphemo, are newcomers to American audiences, but their clash of styles and personalities combine nicely to form perhaps the most entertaining buddy team since Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church plied their wares in Sideways.
The remainder of the cast is solid, but Marcel Van Heerden deserves special mention. His appearance is a shot of energy that props up an otherwise banal third act, and the fact that he can successfully pull off a character who bridges the gap between black and white formed by apartheid is a major coup.
The racial subplots are perhaps one of the strongest points of the film, and they are indicative of a social consciousness that separates White Wedding from its American counterparts.
It is difficult to address race in any medium without arousing ire, but White Wedding manages to do so successfully by taking a “let’s bury the hatchet” stance that stresses the underlying similarities among races rather than the differences.
In one particularly brilliant scene set in an Afrikaner bar, van Zyl attempts to buy Elvis a drink, but he is rebuffed.
“What? You think I don’t have money?” Elvis asks. Van Zyl replies, “What? You think I don’t have problems?”
Perhaps more than anything, White Wedding is a South African film, and it’s culture — from the almost unnavigable countryside to the racial stresses of apartheid — is what makes the film feel so fresh and unique.
A sense of joy permeates the film. It is a celebration of life and love. A celebration of fidelity, grounded by a fundamental belief in the institution of marriage. To pledge yourself to another, to dedicate yourself to growing old with another, it is a worthy goal — something that should be celebrated loudly and publicly, with laughter and joy.
White Wedding was screened as part of Outside the Box (Office). To view the calendar of free film screenings on campus, visit cinema.usc.edu/outsidetheboxoffice.

It took 17 hours to drive to Portland, Ore., but only five minutes of walking around the Peter W. Stott Center to realize that print media is not dead — it’s just hiding.
Do it yourself · The 10th annual Portland Zine Symposium — held last weekend at Portland State University — is a free conference and social gathering for zinesters, small press and other DIY items. - Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan 
For two days this past weekend, Portland State University in Downtown Portland hosted the 10th annual Portland Zine Symposium, a free conference dedicated to all things independent publishing, small press and provocative thought.
With newspapers scaling back staff writers, magazines pandering to their advertisers and independent weeklies shutting down city-wide, today’s zine community is giving hope to the printed word by creating niche-based publications for open-minded leftists, reminding us that if you want something to get done, you’re going to have to do it yourself.
First thing’s first: What is a “zine?”
“Zine” is short for “magazine” and was first used in reference to the multitude of small-run fan magazines (aka fanzines) that emerged with the first science fiction films in the 1940s. National magazines had no interest in the still-underground alien-and-monster market, so sci-fi lovers began self-producing their own as a way to distribute news and fan-fictions.
The spirit of handmade, limited-run, photocopied sci-fi fanzines was soon appropriated by other ignored-by-the-mainstream groups looking for ways to share their information, but the subversive concept also has roots in art manifestos, revolutionary literature and beat poetry chapbooks. A surge in independent publishing came with the underground press of the 1960s and continued through the ’70s and ’80s with punk zines created as a way to both localize the genre and to open it up to those outside of the immediate area.
This nurturing power of independent press has been used by all types of underground communities from early gay rights group Mattachine Society to feminist punks as part of the 1990s’ Riot Grrrl movement.
Traditionally half-letter size and spine-stapled straight out of a black-and-white photocopy machine, zines were originally made to be cheap and portable — essentials for maximum message dissemination. Today, however, zines are a catch-all term used to describe a variety of low-circulation, special-interest periodicals produced independently of major publishing houses. Self-publishing comes in handy for everyone from political radicals to cutesy cartoonists, and with the expansion of equally-as-indie distribution services (aka distros), the medium has seen a resurgence in recent years. Final products can range in size from matchbook to folio, and with a range of crafty accents — such as specialty paper, unique printing methods and hand-sewn bindings — many now blur the line between artwork and publication.
Every possible variance on the empowerment medium was on display at Portland’s Zine Symposium, an annual festival that showcases not only zinesters (as people who make zines call themselves), but also the city of Portland, itself an epicenter of the zine subculture.
To say that Portland is supportive of zine-makers is an understatement. In addition to hosting the longest-running zine festival in the world, Portland is known for its zine-specific bookstores, zine libraries (the largest of which is part of the Multnomah County public library system), and — most importantly — the Independent Publishing Resource Center.
The IPRC is unlike anything else in the country. A nonprofit, it spearheads the organization of the Portland Zine Symposium but is best known for its invaluable community space located in a modest office building in Portland’s Silverlake-esque Pearl District. Full of resources for artists and writers interested in making their own publications, the IPRC is thanked in the liner notes for many of Portland’s hometown zines. With a Mac-filled computer lab, a photocopy machine, a letterpress studio, a craft room, a bookbinding machine and its own expansive zine library, the IPRC is a collaborative environment that accepts anyone who walks through the door.
Free of judgment or elitist attitudes — and with a calendar stacked full of workshops, classes, contests and engaging events — the IPRC fosters organic creativity within the city’s self-publishers and could serve as a model for other towns looking to embrace their potential zinesters.
Like Los Angeles, for instance.
In a city so consumed with marketable media, it’s only logical that the zine scene would be lacking. But when the only other three people brave enough to trek from Los Angeles to the PZS didn’t even know of each other’s existence, the community factor clearly needs help.
No person should be on a self-publishing island, especially in Los Angeles, which has a burgeoning DIY music and art scene of its own, yet two of the other three in attendance didn’t even know there were independent bookstores that would buy their stuff.
Though Los Angeles did have a citywide zine fest once upon a time (2003’s appropriately-titled L.A. Zine Fiesta), it was a combination craft fair and the zine community has since subsisted on super*MARKET, a small-yet-flourishing swap meet-type concert-event held at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood.
The future of zines in Los Angeles is bright, however ­— we have all the ingredients for a flourishing community. First, we have plenty of zines. There are enough artists, writers and DIY people in this city to stock its own zine library. Plus, there are independent bookstores such as Stories in Echo Park, Meltdown Comics in Hollywood and Ooga Booga in Chinatown that offer brick and mortar outlets for small-press publications and local distros. Websites Only For the Open Minded and False Start already sell many art and comic zines online.
Taking cues from Portland, though, Los Angeles could use some glue, a large-scale annual event or a neighborhood center such as IPRC to bind together and motivate all of the city’s disparate creatives. Even though there are 19 people registered on Los Angeles’ “We Make Zines” Ning.com account, a consistent, in-person gathering for social networking should be established where zine-making veterans can share knowledge through panel discussions and first-time self-publishers can attend workshops and learn hands-on skills.
It was sad to hear, but from Venice to Hollywood to Long Beach, the zinesters that showed up at the PZS all said they felt disconnected from resources for their craft.
True, isolation is a common complaint in this city, but it still shouldn’t have taken us a 1,000-mile drive to find each other.

For those souls who have long wondered where to find silk screening stands, vegan entrees, vintage clothing vendors and enough indie bands to make the editors of Pitchfork wet themselves in one place, get thee to Los Angeles State Historic Park this weekend. The Seventh edition of FYF Fest kicks off at noon on Saturday. And with a stacked bill headlined by Panda Bear and The Rapture, it will likely go down as the festival’s most opulent outing yet.
Photos courtesy of Lauren Dukoff, design by Katrina MacGregor 
Before its growth in numbers and prestige necessitated some unfortunate title censorship, the festival was described by its promoters as “a mixtape of bands that would never play with one another but go so well together.”
It would be easy to deride the blatant hipsterisms of the event if it were not such a bargain. For $30, the rough price of a 3-D movie for two at L.A. Live, attendees of FYF Fest will be treated to 12 hours of art installations, record swap meets with dozens of participating stores, a cornucopia of ethnic food trucks and beer gardens and, of course, 37 bands that could normally be found playing anywhere from the Echoplex to Creamfields.
Closing the Oak Stage will be Animal Collective’s founding member Noah Lennox, known by his stage name Panda Bear, playing his first Los Angeles show since 2007. Panda Bear’s set will likely draw heavily from his masterfully melodic, Person Pitch, as well as his lesser known early material and perhaps a new song or two. In any event, the opportunity to hear the cryptic, Beach Boys-inspired epic “Bros” live should be enough to send thousands clamoring to the show.
Another serious grab for the festival is Spanish dance-rock outfit Delorean. Fresh off the release of its luminous new album Subiza (an arguable candidate for the best summer album of 2010), the four-man band plays with the pulse of any club act, but it is its beautiful air piano interludes, vocal layering and tonal range that allows the band to shoot beyond the artistic heights reached by Passion Pit and similar groups.
Those looking for a calmer form of transcendence cannot afford to miss School of Seven Bells. Last seen opening for M83 and Bat for Lashes, the New York trio, fronted by heavenly voiced twin sisters Alejandra and Claudia Deheza, sits somewhere between high concept shoegaze and frigid dream, and the result is a heartbreakingly gorgeous collection of tremolo heavy sound-scapes that would likely put a smile on Kevin Shields’ face.
As for local talents, the festival lineup will feature Dead Man’s Bones, the new folk project of actor Ryan Gosling, friend Zach Shields and the Silverlake Conservatory Children’s Choir (founded by Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea). With a penchant for moody venues, including cemeteries, Gosling and company will share their eerie yet romantic compositions of supernatural sounds with those open to its unique, unsettling quality.
Rounding off the day are numerous bands that have paid their dues at The Smell and other underground venues. Chino tropical punk quartet Abe Vigoda will unleash its frenetic guitars in the afternoon before heading off to Europe with No Age. Lo-fi poster boy Wavves will unveil new material after his disastrous Barcelona Primavera appearance and subsequent rehab stint. Silverlake rock darlings Local Natives, a late addition to the lineup, will also be featured in a late afternoon slot.
FYF Fest founder Sean Carlson, at a mere 25 years old, has described the festival as an aspiration of resurrecting his earlier days of seeing acts such as Murder City Devils in warehouses and other unusual, unregulated locales.
While FYF will usher in more fans than any venues could have contained, the festival still feels like a miracle in its survival and growth. Whether it can retain it’s proudly indie vibe amid its ballooning in size and attractions (a challenge met unconvincingly by Coachella earlier this year) remains to be seen, but for now Carlson’s creation should make for a thrilling way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
FYF Festival will open its doors at noon on Saturday, with tickets available online for $30, which will be placed on will call at the entrance. For those looking to reduce their carbon footprint for a day, the park is easily accessible by taking the Metro Gold Line to the Chinatown Station. The shebang officially wraps at midnight, but don’t be surprised if the after parties rage into the early hours.

This may come as a shock to the millions of fans who wait with bated breath and a bottle of self-tanner in hand every Thursday night at 10 pm.  The so-called “gorilla juiceheads” of MTV’s smash hit “Jersey Shore” did not take home the Emmy for Outstanding Reality Show.
In fact, they weren’t even nominated.
While the rest of the cast may be drowning their sorrows in RonRon Juice, Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino is in, well, a much better situation.
During Monday night’s episode of “The Bachelor Pad,” ABC officially announced that The Situation will be starring in Season 11 of “Dancing with the Stars” alongside other quasi-celebrities such as Bristol Palin,  “Baywatch’s” David Hasselhoff, singer Michael Bolton, “Brady Bunch” actress Florence Henderson and retired NFL quarterback Kurt Warner.
Other contestants include singer Brandy, comedienne Margaret Cho, “Dirty Dancing” star Jennifer Grey, Disney Channel’s Kyle Massey, NBA athlete-turned-actor Rick Fox and Audrina Patridge of “The Hills”.
The Situation can fist pump with the best of them, but can he dance? We’ll see if all those nights in the club paid off when the new season of “Dancing With the Stars” airs Sept. 20 on ABC.

President Barack Obama announced the end of America’s combat mission in Iraq Tuesday evening, acknowledging the “enormous sacrifices” troops have made since military operations began in Iraq more than seven years ago.
“Operation Iraqi Freedom is over,” Obama said.
U.S. operations in Iraq will take on a transitional approach, Obama said, as some troops will remain on the ground to advise and assist Iraqi security forces. These troops will be gone by the end of this year, he said.
“Iraqis are a proud people,” the president said from his desk in the Oval Office. “They have rejected sectarian war and they have no interest in endless destruction. They understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.”
“Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders,” Obama continued. “What American can do, and will do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner.”
The United States has paid a “huge price,” Obama said, in assisting Iraq.
More than 4,400 American soldiers died and more than 31,000 were wounded since former President George W. Bush announced the start of the war in March 2003. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed.
The United States still has an active presence in Afghanistan, and Obama said additional troops would be deployed to the country to “break the Taliban’s momentum.” Obama was quick to explain that this would be a temporary measure, and a transition to Afghan responsibility would begin in August 2011.
Obama also used the national address as a moment to comment on economic policy, citing massive spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — to the tune of more than $1 trillion — as part of the reason behind rising U.S. deficits.
The restoration of the economy is the nation’s “most urgent task,” the president said.
“And so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad,” Obama said. “They have met every test that they faced. Now, it is our turn.”

What do you do when your alma mater builds an extravagant student center with a perfect setting for stand-up comedy?
Come back and perform, of course.
That’s what MadTV veteran Michael McDonald, Chelsea Lately comedian Brad Wollack and the LAist-dubbed “2-man sketch comedy beast” Tremendosaur, Justin Michael and Jacob Reed, triumphantly did Sunday night. The show, dubbed “Commedus Alumnus” by USC Spectrum, was part of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s opening extravaganza and took place in Tommy’s Place, Traditions’ performance venue element.
Tremendosaur played host to the show, echoing strongly its recent improv past with campus group Second Nature. After a low-energy start to the show that involved some expressed bitterness about the niceness of the center and a quite failed joke about cheetahs and poker, they took a definite second seat to the real action.
The audience could not help but peg the youngsters as what they properly label in the comedy world as “noobs.” The pair even spent a good five minutes bickering — non-comically — about whether or not to do a certain segment.
The crowd, which, according to an informal clap-o-meter held by the duo, was mostly freshmen. Freshmen, unfamiliar with the real world of comedy shows, don’t have a two-drink limit to get them liquidly prepared for silliness.
The real heart of the event, Wollack and McDonald, explored topics familiar and dear to the USC student population, including an inexplicable anger toward the Department of Public Safety, the shock that the Daily Trojan now prints in color, living in dorms and the unforgettable experience of being mugged at knifepoint late at night outside of Del Taco.
Wollack, the unbelievably pasty E! Entertainment Television regular, opened with an  almost uncomfortably raunchy set. Nothing was sacred: the color of his pubic hair, Reggie Bush, his sex habits with his wife and the Holocaust were just some of the subjects of his bits.
He even answered a phone call from an old college buddy, who didn’t believe that Wollack would be allowed to perform at ’SC.
More enjoyably, Wollack’s quips at noisy audience members combined with his pronounced Trojan background gave students a familiar and intimate show. He even gave such audience members names: “Black Guy 1,” “Black Guy 2,” “Asian Girl/Senior Drunkard” and most notably, “Masturbate Boy.”
McDonald’s set started off with a pleasant recounting of his ’SC experience and his first heartbreak: surrendering a fast food burrito to muggers on Figueroa. Sounding off on trashy television, Arizona and being mistaken for another funny Trojan alumnus, Will Ferrell, the actor indulged the crowd by doing a little bit of his beloved infantile Stuart character from MadTV.
Though McDonald’s set verged into the depressing — he even discussed his mother’s sick jokes, which included fooling him into thinking she had a tumor by putting a contact on her tongue — his underlying message was appropriately hopeful for the young audience members in the audience.
“Find the funny in whatever issues you might be going through,” McDonald said. “Sometimes, the cancer turns out to be a contact.”
Tommy’s Place, which Wollack dubbed as “sitting room only” has the perfect vibe for comedy shows. With comfortable seats and easy access to beers and bar food, Tommy’s Place echoes “grown-up” venues like the Laugh Factory and other L.A.-area comedy clubs.
There is real potential for some truly great comedy shows here, but groups other than lanyard-sporting, dewy-eyed freshmen just have to get excited about it too. Though the administration has clearly made the venue — and even next-door Traddies — democratically and appropriately accessible to a large part of the student population, promoters need to make a concerted effort to cater to uppperclassmen, graduate students, and staff and faculty in order to keep the venue healthily mixed.
To not do so would be a waste of some really great potential.
Perhaps later events — not affiliated with the usually freshmen-heavy Welcome Week shenanigans — will bring a more diverse population to the venue.
When less than 10 percent of the room is plowing through pitchers during a comedy show, that 10 percent can’t help but feel like drunkards. Especially for “Asian Girl/Senior Drunkard.”
Harsh. The acerbity does little to hide that you do not know much about comedy.
Well, my favorite part was Tremendosaur! I wouldn’t call them “noobs”. And I wasn’t even drunk.

A lot has been said about Glenn Beck’s rally in Washington, D.C.  on Saturday.
Beck’s opponents have loudly objected to his decision to speak at the Lincoln Memorial on the anniversary on Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Civil rights activists held a demonstration on the same day to protest Beck’s alleged “hijacking” of King’s legacy.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Beck said the rally was not intentionally scheduled on the anniversary of King’s speech. He also used the criticism of his event to argue that he is in fact continuing the legacy of the civil rights movement by standing up for his beliefs in the face of oppression. Beck claimed that his rally was nonpolitical, that he was taking a break from his regular conservative punditry to speak about honoring the military and restoring morality in the United States.
Beck has not been honest about his intentions, nor did his critics understand the true problem with his rally. The problem lies in Beck’s insistence on the political neutrality of his speech and with that speech’s emphasis on religion.
Beck is not hijacking King’s legacy; in fact, as Beck himself noted, he is incapable of doing so. King’s legacy is, and forever will be, so much greater than Beck’s that to propose a comparison of the two is laughable (though I find it highly unlikely that the rally’s timing was an accident.) Beck is an expert at attracting attention by generating controversy. More important than the debate over the significance of the date is Beck’s nonsensical claim that the rally was apolitical.
Any speech to 300,000 people gathered around the reflecting pool at the Lincoln Memorial is inherently political. The long legacy of notable gatherings there — including the Million Man March and protests against both the Vietnam and Iraq wars — has established that a speech delivered from Lincoln’s feet is a request that its content be evaluated in the context of public policy. By masquerading his rally as an apolitical, value-oriented event, Beck was able to get away with making policy demands that are typically taboo because their extremism is not only unconstitutional, but threatening to the foundations of American society.
Beck’s speech concentrated on religion. “Something unimaginable is happening,” he began. “America today begins to turn back to God.” He later requested that audience members “recognize your place to the creator. Realize that he is our king … pray on your knees, but pray on your knees but with your door open for your children to see.”
Such a speech delivered at a church or neutral site would not only be harmless but commendable. Unfortunately, the site was far from neutral. By timing and locating his rally as he did, Beck succeeded in giving his speech a heavily political tone — and a dangerous one at that.
Rhetoric aside, Beck demanded that religion and politics mix even more than they already do in the United States. In the context of those major debates, such as those over the proposed Islamic community center two blocks from Ground Zero in New York City or the increasingly frustrated campaign in Afghanistan, a religious point of view has the opportunity to assert itself in public discourse and in government policymaking. Beck’s speech moved such a development closer to fruition.
This would be an unmistakable tragedy. The separation of church and state is a core principle of our nation and constitution. The erosion of this barrier has damaged our stature as the “land of the free,” and continues to chip away at our chance of ever reclaiming the international moral high ground and the “soft power” that comes with it. Holding an event that was widely compared to a 19th-century style religious revival at the Lincoln Memorial hardly helps reverse this course of events.
The strong association of the tea party with Beck’s event will allow tea party candidates to claim religious parity with the more traditional conservatives they are fighting. Seeing as the current crop of tea party candidates includes some of the most absurd viewpoints espoused by American politicians, this can hardly be viewed as a positive development for the country.
Beck (and Rush Limbaugh, Keith Olbermann, and the rest of America’s firebrand commentators) has made a living out of doublespeak, but he has never used it to such dangerous ends as on Saturday. If others learn by his example (and I do not doubt that they will), extreme punditry will become stronger and more sinister than ever.

Kudos to Simon for finding an actual historical document. But again, my friend, it’s not the Constitution. It’s a letter… and no, it was not “far more than a personal correspondence.” It was a letter. The sentiment expressed there was entirely legitimate, as it is legitimate now for folks to desire separation of church and state. However, it is not legitimate for that phrase to be misused and misapplied as Constitutional, which is what our young friend Daniel clearly stated “a core principle of our Constitution.” 
What’s more — what does this have to do with a group of people getting together in D.C. and praying? They have the freedom to do that, too. Daniel’s twitchy leftism notwithstanding, this is no threat to America. And Simon, you are entirely misled if you are under the impression that because you have read something written by ONE founder, you have a handle on how they all felt about religion. On the contrary, as Beck and many, many scholars have pointed out, the vast majority of the founders were Christian, and believed that this country was being founded with God’s express assistance. Now, you are free to reject those beliefs today. But to deny them — to LIE and make ridiculous comments about “conservatives hating our founders” when you clearly have not taken the time to read ALL their writings — is just pathetic.
And you show a great deal of historical ignorance with your comment about a Taliban-style cult. Clearly, this country has been “more Christian” in the past than it is today. If Christianity lent itself to a Taliban-style cult, buddy, you’d already be living in it. But it doesn’t. What an idiotic and ignorant comparison.
That was obviously meant to be a camel walking through the needle. But picturing Jerry Falwell trying to do the same is enough to keep me entertained for the time being!
Why do conservatives hate our founders? Why do they hate our history, America’s rich traditions? Why does Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and his band of lunatics want to turn our country into a Taliban-style cult? Tommy Jefferson had it right….
Jefferson’s Wall of Separation Letter
Thomas Jefferson was a man of deep religious conviction — his conviction was that religion was a very personal matter, one which the government had no business getting involved in. He was vilified by his political opponents for his role in the passage of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and for his criticism of such biblical events as the Great Flood and the theological age of the Earth. As president, he discontinued the practice started by his predecessors George Washington and John Adams of proclaiming days of fasting and thanksgiving. He was a staunch believer in the separation of church and state.
Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802 to answer a letter from them written in October 1801. A copy of the Danbury letter is available here. The Danbury Baptists were a religious minority in Connecticut, and they complained that in their state, the religious liberties they enjoyed were not seen as immutable rights, but as privileges granted by the legislature — as “favors granted.” Jefferson’s reply did not address their concerns about problems with state establishment of religion — only of establishment on the national level. The letter contains the phrase “wall of separation between church and state,” which led to the short-hand for the Establishment Clause that we use today: “Separation of church and state.”
The letter was the subject of intense scrutiny by Jefferson, and he consulted a couple of New England politicians to assure that his words would not offend while still conveying his message: it was not the place of the Congress or the Executive to do anything that might be misconstrued as the establishment of religion.
Note: The bracketed section in the second paragraph had been blocked off for deletion in the final draft of the letter sent to the Danbury Baptists, though it was not actually deleted in Jefferson’s draft of the letter. It is included here for completeness. Reflecting upon his knowledge that the letter was far from a mere personal correspondence, Jefferson deleted the block, he noted in the margin, to avoid offending members of his party in the eastern states.
This is a transcript of the final letter as stored online at the Library of Congress, and reflects Jefferson’s spelling and punctuation.
Mr. President
To messers Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, & Stephen S. Nelson, a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.
Gentlemen
The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should “make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. [Congress thus inhibited from acts respecting religion, and the Executive authorised only to execute their acts, I have refrained from prescribing even those occasional performances of devotion, practiced indeed by the Executive of another nation as the legal head of its church, but subject here, as religious exercises only to the voluntary regulations and discipline of each respective sect.] Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.
I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association assurances of my high respect & esteem.
(signed) Thomas Jefferson
Jan.1.1802.
Another year, another batch of failed products of our alma mater sign up as reporters at the Daily Trojan in order to score points with their favorite drug-addled liberal professors. When a bunch of Christian conservatives gather at the feet of (noted Christian conservative) Abraham Lincoln on the anniversary of a speech by (noted Christian conservative) Martin Luther King, to talk about Christian and conservative values, and factually do not speak about politics, you’ll need to come up with a better criticism than “It was all about politics, even though we all know it wasn’t, it was.” Indeed, instead of calling these values “dangerous” and “threatening” and “absurd”, how about identifying them and telling us, specifically, why they are wrong? If all you can do is insult your opponents with dubious slurs like “19th-century style religious revival” (that’s a bad thing?), then you don’t have much of an argument.
Finally, your attempt to give “advice” to conservatives is greatly appreciated. It’s always so nice when the Left makes these helpful suggestions about what we ought to do.  Rush Limbaugh says: the Left will always show you who they fear.
@Diane
Well said. THEY can’t handle the TRUTH. It’s even more interesting that there are no leftist pundits here yet. Nothing to say huh?
Oh, Daniel Charnoff. You are a scared little mouse, aren’t you? The DANGER of encouraging people to pray to God! I’m appalled! {{snicker}}
I fear for the value of a USC education if you, a senior, still don’t understand that separation of church and state is in fact not IN our Constitution, so it can’t really be a “core principle” of it. But, hey, way to spread the nonsense. 
Considering you are taking a broad swipe at a powerful, interesting, and charismatic personality (Beck) with your snide comments about legacies — I encourage you to shut your mouth and actually listen to what he has to say. He has shared a great deal of historical information with the American public that has been suppressed too long. You might consider, oh, I don’t know — opening your mind to the possibility that you, at your advanced age, don’t really know everything just yet. Oh, I know you watch CNN and MSNBC (never Fox!) so you know all the right catchphrases and can hit just the right note of smug elitist condescension — but that doesn’t change the fact that you don’t know WTF you are talking about.
Your concern for “traditional conservative” candidates who are having to fight off Tea Party candidates — um, that doesn’t even make sense, Daniel. Who do you consider a “traditional conservative”? Boxer? You have been on campus too long. Get out in the real world, son. The Tea Party actually has a lot of “traditional conservatives” in it who are fighting for viewpoints that are only considered absurd by the most jaded and hard left idealogues (like our president) who wish to see individual liberty curtailed in favor of statist control. Yup, those “absurd viewpoints” include things like limited government and free market policies — things that have (a) historically been American hallmarks and (b) are still supported by a vast majority of Americans. Except for the aforementioned idealogues — and college students too dumb to think for themselves.

The second week of class is upon us. Freshmen, this means you’re about to get acquainted with your roommates. Really acquainted. Step past the polite introductory phase, because you’re going to see all the strange habits suddenly emerge: food hoarding, passive aggressive Post-it notes, nightly midnight Skype sessions — for every quirk, there’s at least one person who can’t tolerate it.

William Brown | Daily Trojan
There is an obvious way to attempt preventing so-called bad matches: allowing incoming freshman to choose their own roommates. According to an article in The New York Times, more and more colleges are teaming up with matching services, which help said incoming freshmen find someone suitable to live with. If you choose your own roommate, how could anything go wrong?
Well, that’s the problem. There really isn’t much room for mistakes. It’s for this reason that colleges shouldn’t encourage freshmen to choose their own roommates. Our time here isn’t just about academic learning; if that were the case, American society wouldn’t see these four years as such a rite of passage. It’s also about self-discovery, as cheesy as the concept may sound.  By allowing new students to stay in their comfort zones, colleges erode that important self-discovery process, leaving students less prepared for the real world.
At top colleges, many students come from highly controlled environments. After all, to be a viable candidate one must manage grades, extracurriculars, applications, test scores and so on. Moreover, colleges have noted an increase in “helicopter parents” who micromanage their kids’ lives for fear that they’ll make mistakes. And even if none of that sounds familiar, consider the predictability of school in general: you know what classes you’re going to take, what books you’re going to read and when your midterms and finals will be. In comparison, the rhythms of most workplaces are inconsistent. It’s imperative that we use our time at college to learn how to deal with factors we can’t control.
Random roommates can help eliminate some of the prejudices people might grow up with. There’s much more to diversity then culture; accepting different kinds of personalities is important, too.
Say a traditionally studious girl rooms with an extrovert who goes out five nights a week. Girl No. 1 might write her roommate off as an idiot — until finding out that she maintains a 3.8 GPA. The realization would challenge her view of what a good student is, and might prevent her from jumping to similar conclusions in the future.
In the best case scenarios, roommates who seem like they have nothing in common develop friendships and introduce each other to new kinds of music, movies and hobbies. When colleges allow students to screen their roommates from the very beginning, students are more likely to gravitate toward people who reinforce the worldviews they already have. That’s unfortunate; at big schools like USC, it’s already easy to find your counterparts and stick with them for four years.
But what about the worst case scenarios? We’ve all heard horror stories about That One Roommate that made the last paragraph sound like it was cut out of a Disney movie. That’s why we have the option of switching roommates — a safety net that doesn’t really exist after college. If you were to end up with a horrible boss, you would have few options short of quitting. You would have to accept his personality and his grating mannerisms, or at least learn to deal with them. Wouldn’t you be glad to have lived with that crazy roommate of yours, if only for a few months? Negotiation — especially with someone you can barely tolerate — is an surprisingly important skill.
You’re more likely to be more open-minded about your roommate if you don’t make the choice yourself. People who use matching services generally have a set of criteria they want their roommates to fulfill — criteria those roommates rarely meet. Students who stick with random selection have fewer expectations. They’re probably satisfied with “is clean and doesn’t watch me sleep,” so it’s far harder to be truly disappointed.
Yes, college is full of changes, but you can avoid most new experiences by hiding in your room — unless it’s inhabited by someone you didn’t choose. USC should encourage incoming freshmen to take a leap of faith and leave the roommate choice to a random computer assignment.

Looking for something to read this semester that can serve as a break from assigned texts? Something that can also offer a new perspective on topics in class? The place to look is comic books.
The “funny pages” are not just for kids, and they are not just staid action stories. The best comics, superhero or otherwise, offer a commentary on society. A great example of this is Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra’s multiple award-winning comic book series Y: The Last Man.
The series revolves around a simple premise: What would happen if all the males in the world, human or otherwise, suddenly died? After a plague kills off every male mammal, society is left broken. Almost all governments are wiped out, armies obliterated and male cultural heroes like The Rolling Stones gone. The only male survivors are Yorick Brown and his pet monkey, Ampersand.
The series is both a drama exploring Yorick’s trials in the world and an examination of society. Alongside Guerra’s detailed, expressive art, Vaughan’s scripts offer something for tastes — and all college majors
Studying society and government? Check out how countries try to restructure when many of the politicians are dead. Gender studies majors might be interested to see the rise of an ultra-feminist movement that comes out of the elimination of all Y-chromosome-bearing creatures. Those studying theater or English will appreciate that Yorick and his family are named after Shakespearian characters, and that Vaughan drops in a number of references to the Bard’s work.
So if class-assigned reading has taken its toll and a good book is all you seek, give Y: The Last Man a shot. You might also be seeing it on a big screen soon, too; New Line Cinema acquired the series rights in 2007, and the project is currently in development. Director D.J. Caruso (of Disturbia fame) is loosely attached to the project.

With the reckless abandon and physical strength that current Pittsburgh Steeler Troy Polamalu plays with, it is no wonder the All-Pro safety missed most of last season due to a knee injury.
But, while most other NFL players would be concerned about injuries to the knee or concussions, the former USC safety has taken out a hefty insurance policy, though not a common one for athletes. It’s a $1 million policy with Lloyds of London, endorsed by Head & Shoulders, to insure his hair.
Polamalu’s hair is one of his most distinguishing characteristics and a tribute to his Samoan heritage, where it is customary for men to wear their hair long.
Though this may seem like a crazy proposition, it does make sense for Polamalu. In 2006, he was ready to return an interception for a touchdown, but Kansas City running back Larry Johnson pulled his hair in order to tackle him.
Lloyds of London has been known to insure the body parts of famous people, including Tina Turner’s legs, Celine Dion’s vocal cords and even the body of former professional wrestler Ric Flair — now, the company has a two-time Super Bowl champion to add to that list.

As the Ronald Tutor Campus Center celebrated its grand opening last week, USC’s historic on-campus bar, Traditions, re-opened to the public with some major changes.
Slap on · A DPS officer places a wristband on a student before she enters Traditions bar. Students must have wristbands to drink at the new bar and grill, which now allows students under 21 to enter. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Traditions, located in the basement of the campus center, is now adjacent to Tommy’s Place, a new concert venue featuring performances by both USC students and other non-affiliated groups. In addition, Traditions is now a full-service bar and grill restaurant.
According to Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, the venue was created as yet another location for students to relax and have fun while on campus.
“Our goal was to provide a space for all students, staff and faculty to enjoy,” he said.
In the past, Traditions was only accessible to students who were 21 or older. Now, the age restriction has been lifted and all students can visit both the restaurant and Tommy’s Place.
However, officials said this modification of rules does not change USC’s zero-tolerance policy for underage drinking on campus.
The entrance to Traditions is monitored by a Department of Public Safety officer who will check the identification of every person who wishes to enter the facility. People older than  21 will receive wristbands indicating they are allowed to order and consume alcohol.
Thus far, Klinger reported there have been one or two instances of underage students attempting to acquire wristbands from others.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said he anticipates that underage students trying to obtain alcohol will be a minor issue.
“We hope that by publicizing that we are enforcing the rules, it will discourage people from breaking them,” Carlisle said.
Any student found breaking the rules will have their student information documented and sent to USC Student Judicial Affairs.
Beverly Tse, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said she doesn’t believe underage drinking at Traditions will be a problem, even with the opening of Tommy’s Place.
“There are so many ways to get alcohol off campus,” she said. “I wouldn’t come to a school-operated facility.”
Jacquee Bell, a sophomore majoring in theatre, disagrees.
She said she believes opening Traditions to underage students will allow them to find methods of obtaining alcohol once they are inside.
“The potential for problems exists because people can very easily slip off the wristbands or find discarded ones and put them on their wrists,” she said.
But, Klinger said he believes the security measures that are already in place will be adequate to deter students from engaging in illegal behavior.
“It’s a concern and we take it very seriously, but we also need to realize all the security resources we have available,” he said.

Law students from the USC Intellectual Property and Technology Clinic helped to secure a significant copyright exemption this summer on behalf of documentary filmmakers who wish to extract materials from DVDs.
Free · Documentary producers can now use DVD materials in their films, thanks to USC law students. - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Chris Perez, a USC law school graduate, and Ashlee Lin, a current law student, lobbied for the exemption during talks to amend the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, which criminalizes the act of extracting materials from DVDs.
Jack Lerner, assistant professor of law at USC and director of the clinic, saw this lack of access as a problem.
“A central part of documentary filmmaking is discussing material to which you do not hold copyrights,” Lerner said. “As DVDs became the default media of our time, it became harder for filmmakers to become engaged in this type of commentary because of the laws around encryption.”
Perez and Lin drafted and submitted a comment in 2008 about the issue to the U.S. Copyright Office. This was followed up by an additional comment submitted in February 2009. The pair secured the exemption last July.
“The students drafted every comment, every piece of correspondence with the copyright office,” Lerner said. “This is on their shoulders and has been from the start.”
In collaboration with Los Angeles-based attorney Michael C. Donaldson, the students represented Kartemquin Films of Chicago, the International Documentary Association and a national coalition of documentary filmmakers and filmmaker organizations.
Perez explains that they faced formidable opposition during the process, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry of America and Warner Brothers, who all saw the exemption as a license for piracy.
The exemption, however, would merely restore to filmmakers the ability to make fair use of material for appraisal, rather than to copy and distribute entire DVDs for monetary gain.
Before the exemption, it was impossible for documentary filmmakers to reap the benefits of the fair use doctrine. The students were able to secure use of brief quotes from DVDs to comply with the doctrine.
Law student Jimmy Chen sees the modified ruling as “the law catching up to itself.” He and Daniel Fullerton, a graduate student studying law, are working to inform the film industry about the new exemption.
“We have a four-pronged plan,” Fullerton said. “A brochure will be posted online, a website will be set up, a short film made to train filmmakers how to handle material in light of the exemption and speaking events will be arranged.”
The clinic is now in the process of attempting to inform the documentary film community of this exemption in hopes that more filmmakers will take advantage of documentary film.
The USC Intellectual Property and Technology Clinic was formed as a crossroads of law, technology and policy, Lerner said. It aids policymakers, artists, innovators and non-profit organizations in attempts to secure their rights on a variety of issues.
