Los Angeles seems to be a mecca for healthy, clean foods, where everyone is up-to-date on the latest health trends. People will buy anything from cold-pressed juices to Kombucha to zucchini noodles if they see a nutritional benefit. There are countless places around the expansive city to find nutritional vegan or vegetarian meals: Cafe Gratitude, By Chloe and Zinc Cafe. However, some people think healthy food is inaccessible right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. Many of the current options are either too expensive or too far from Downtown. To fix this problem, husband and wife Richard Torres and Lizbeth Sanchez created Wild Living Foods. The vegan restaurant is situated on Main Street in the heart of Downtown. Wild Living Foods was created with the purpose of making clean, plant-based food more convenient to people in the Downtown community.

Many of my vegan friends raved about Wild Living Foods, so I decided to give it a try. The  restaurant’s name is in recognizable pink and blue neon lettering. Upon walking inside, I was first struck by vibrant designs and decorations. The restaurant is also spacious, with high walls and lots of seating. One wall is a giant, colorful mural, the floor is an assembly of patterned tiles and there are ceramic decorations on almost every surface.

I was skeptical about the menu at first, because everything is completely raw and vegan. I decided to order the New God Flow smoothie with cashew butter, cold brew coffee, vanilla, dates and mucuna power. I also ordered a delicious guacamole served with hopi blue corn chips and a spicy tuna roll made with almond tuna. The sushi was excellent, and I am now a new fan of almond tuna. The roll was savory, and the fresh tuna was balanced perfectly by the crunchy vegetables. The smoothie was creamy and the perfect level of sweetness.

My friend ordered the Basil Pesto Pesto, which consisted of kelp noodles with a basil pesto sauce. I gave her meal a try, and was pleasantly surprised by the texture and neutral taste of the kelp noodles. My friend also ordered the Pink Dragon smoothie made of strawberries, pitaya and goji, and claimed it was terrific.

I will most definitely be returning to Wild Living Foods despite the fact that I am not vegan. This place is a must-try for anybody who wants a clean, nutritional meal at a reasonable price. It serves a wide variety of items like smoothies, burgers, juices, pad thai and avocado toast. It’s the perfect spot for a quick lunch or dinner, and you’ll leave feeling incredibly satisfied.

Admittedly, walking into a fitness studio for the first time can be extremely intimidating. I know firsthand the fear of the unknown hour that lies ahead can easily prevent oneself from trying a new class. If you relate to this feeling or have a friend that is hesitant to join you in your fitness endeavours, this blog is dedicated to overcoming a fear of a fitness first — with a twist. 
Three years ago, I stepped into my first cycling class and was terrified within the first two minutes. When I opened the doors to the studio, I was shocked by the lack of natural light, the intensity of the music and the abundance of people spinning a mile a minute. To make matters worse, my bike was front row center, located next to what seemed like professional cyclists. I sat down, hesitant about what I just got myself into. However, after 45 minutes of struggling and sweating, the lights turned on, the music turned down, and I felt a newfound sense of pleasure from pushing myself to try something new. While cycling can take a few classes to get used to and I do not recommend sitting front row for your first class, this fitness first taught me a lot about myself. I was so used to doing the same workout that I felt a great sense of accomplishment after conquering my fear of cycling. I can proudly say that I now enjoy cycling, but could not have gotten to this point if I did not challenge myself. The ultimate takeaway from this experience is to not be afraid to break out of your fitness comfort zone. 
Fitness is not just physical; it is also mental. This brings me to my next first: a mindful meditation class. My first mindful meditation class was a completely different experience from my cycling class. Instead of loud music, there was a soft sound of the ocean playing in the background, and the darkness was not intended to intensify the atmosphere, but rather play a soothing role.
Overall, I walked into this fitness experience with a much calmer mindset. However, once the class started, my fear of this fitness first started to kick in. The instructor told the class to use one’s imagination as she guided us through a meditative course. I could not turn my mind off,and as I started to think about all of the things I needed to do after class, I worried about how distracted I was and could not complete the instructor’s requests. I left the class feeling frustrated by my inability to have a successful experience, but, taking my own advice from my cycling class, I pushed myself and tried again. The second mindful meditation class I took, I was able to remind myself that not all things come easily on the first try. This put my mind at ease and I was able to focus on the techniques my instructor was teaching. I can now vouch that success should be measured on a personal scale, and if you focus on yourself rather than the experiences of those around you, you will be much happier with the results of your fitness first. 
It is crucial to remember that a fitness first is not intended to be easy, but rather it is a way to test your abilities. Overcoming a fear of trying something new tests your inner strength, while completing a new type of exercise challenges your physical strength. So, next time you want to try a new class but are afraid of the unknown, remember the reward is greater than the risk.

On Tuesday, a terrorist attack occurred on Westminster Bridge about a mile and a half from my flat in central London, killing four and injuring 40, seven of whom are in critical condition. The attack occurred when a car drove into a crowd on Westminster Bridge before crashing into the gate surrounding the House of Parliament. The attacker then reportedly exited the car and fatally stabbed a police officer before being shot down. 
When I was first alerted of the attack, what struck me was fear. I was less than a mile from the attack, it was ongoing, and I had to get home. There was speculation that this was just one of many attacks planned for around London. I avoided the tube, I half-walked, half-ran the full half mile home, with my palms sweating and pulse quickening. 
When I finally got to my flat, turned around and locked the door behind me, I thought there would be a sense of relief, safety or comfort. But there was none. Instead, there was a deep emptiness I felt in the pit of my stomach, turning on the BBC and seeing the images of Big Ben and Westminster Bridge shrouded in blood, fear and unsightly human suffering. The golden beacon that is Big Ben was drenched in the shadow of red and blue sirens. 
It was difficult for me to put into words at the time what exactly I was feeling. I was at home, safe in my flat, and all of my friends were safe as well. I should feel grateful, or at least a sense of relief, but instead I felt horror, and I felt disillusionment.
The night after the attack, I couldn’t sleep. My mind was racing and once I woke up the next morning, I realized it was not so much that the attacks occurred in a city that I have called home for the last few months, it was Westminster Bridge.

Since I have moved here, I have walked across the Westminster Bridge dozens of times. It’s a wide, expansive pathway over the Thames River, with low walls that make you almost feel like you’re walking on water. Look to your left and you see the London Eye — representing the new, the future of London. Look to your right and you see Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament — rising up against the skyline as a symbol of the stalwart, impenetrable institution of the city of London and their system of democracy. On a good day, the Houses of Parliament glitter in the sunlight as its reflection dances across the Thames. 
But even still, I wasn’t so affected because the attack occurred at a beautiful place. It’s because this piece of London belongs to everyone, and that’s what kept drawing me back to it. Some parts of London are exclusive, designated for the native Londoner. The Westminster Bridge was never exclusionary. From the second you step onto the bridge for the first time, you belong. It is a piece of London that belongs to everyone. Whether it’s your first day in London or your last, the bridge belongs to everyone. It is where you become a Londoner. And that is why the attack is particularly gruesome for me. This place, this slice of London that is accessible and recognizable by all, became a scene of heartbreak and pain. 
I have been those people on the bridge. It was the one place in London that I always felt like I belonged. I was there a few days ago, if it had not been so rainy and cold the day of the attacks, I may have been there again. The day prior I had given someone directions to the bridge, telling them it was a beautiful way to see the city and recommending they go. I hope they didn’t. 
I’m still sorting through how I feel about the incident, how long until I’ll go back to Westminster Bridge. But I will go back. And when I do, I hope it is still filled with the same joy, awe and sense of belonging that it once was. This part of London still belongs to all of us, it does not and cannot belong to fear.

For starters, I know I have been slacking. But sometimes I have to get my ducks in a row and my life more in order before I could even begin to put my thoughts down into Microsoft Word. I feel like the one constant in my life right now is the stress of figuring out what exactly it is I want to do with the “real life” that we are so often told starts after we get our diplomas and graduate. But the funny thing is that “real life” is happening right now, all around us, even right now as you read this.
I know all too well how often life can seem to pass you by — it wasn’t until I actually had an assignment for one of my occupational therapy classes to track my daily activities, which entailed the documentation ofevery hour, even the ones spent mindlessly watching Buzzfeed Tasty videos. (You know we all do it.) After reflecting on the assignment and life in general as I so often tend to, I found myself thinking of all the things I would have done differently with my time. So for this week’s article I decided to give a few of of the takeaways I got from doing the assignment to anyone who may find themselves reading this in hopes that we’ll all find a way to live our best lives throughout the day.
Don’t worry about the pimple! 
Literally everyone gets them. We are all human and yes, sometimes they may come at the most inopportune times, but rejoice in the fact that this too shall pass. In fact, I have one right now so we are all in this together (queue High School Musical song) also, since I keep it real with you guys… Nobody cares! It ain’t that serious boo boo. 
Do The Dang Thang
If you’re anything like me you are constantly buying the latest self-help, meditation, key to wellness book in order to fool yourself into thinking you have any more control over your life than you may or may not actually have. Yet they all seem to collect dust on a bookshelf rather than be read. So rather than scrolling for another hour, read even just one chapter a day in that new book you’ve been eyeing on that dusty bookshelf of yours. It may not be reading a book for you…but that thang that thang (OK Lauryn Hill come thru I see you), do it!
Treat yourself
It goes without saying at this point that we all live extremely fast-paced lives and often don’t take the due diligence necessary in caring for ourselves or our interests. Stop it, girl! You deserve that sheet mask, that extra scoop of ice cream, or that “one more episode on Netflix.” As a girl we put way too much pressure on ourselves to look better, feel better and do better in all areas of life. Honey, that is no way to live. It’s OK to not have it all together. And if you don’t you still deserve to reward yourself for merely existing, you queen (or king for my male readers). 
Let me repeat myself again — this is your real life. Real life is not something that only begins once school ends but is what you get a chance to participant in and create every day. Whether that means sleeping in past noon, finally creating a work out routine or crossing things off your bucket list you had reserved for that always elusive “when you have time” time in your schedule. Give yourself permission to stop being the hamster on the running wheel and enjoy yourself for once.

While the school was on spring break, the No. 12 men’s volleyball team spent their week hard at work. They finished off their fourth non-conference match on Sunday against Sacred Heart to extend their win streak to four games, which is the team’s longest since 2015. The Trojans will look to continue adding to that win column as they finish off the stretch of non-conference games with Concordia on Friday.
“That is a team that is going to be really challenging for us,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “Every match from here on out, as they all should have been, is the most important match we are going to have all season long. UCLA doesn’t exist until after Concordia. Santa Barbara doesn’t exist until after UCLA. There are a lot of stepping stones toward what we are trying to achieve.”
Even though these four victories go toward the team’s overall record, they do not count for the playoffs. While the wins may have no impact on their conference record, they still show what the team can achieve game after game. It is validation that what they are doing in practice is paying off. 
“The playoffs are truly what matters the most,” Nygaard said. “We want to get better and better every single time out. We want to implement all the little things we have been talking about and all the big things. This is an opportunity to go out and showcase against a really talented team and work on some of the things that we are trying to implement and get really good at come to those in-conference matches.”
The Trojans have already played Concordia once this season and won to keep their record against the school a perfect 4-0. However, both teams have come a long way since the beginning of the season. For USC, the team has bought into the Trojan motto of “fighting on” as the season has developed. They came from being behind two sets to defeating Sacred Heart on Sunday and Nygaard was quick to give credit to his players.
“The guys are really absorbing it, taking it, and making it their own,” Nygaard said. “You can be as strong-willed a coach as you want, but if the guys aren’t representing it and doing it themselves, it only goes so far.”
The team will also get a chance to reconnect with their USC men’s volleyball history as the alumni game will be on Saturday. Not only will the current players get to face off against previous members in a friendly game, but they will also get to enjoy the company of players who lived in their shoes years before and get advice from them.
“The coolest thing about [the alumni game] is that there is a lot of remembrances, iconography and names in our locker room,” Nygaard said. “Then the wall pops to life and there is that person that you see in a picture that you see right in front of you having a live, one on one conversation. It is not just USC men’s volleyball and the history; it’s there is that person who can talk about the exact experience that they had … This is a chance to tie in that old school formative years that created what USC men’s volleyball is and should be.”
The Trojans will take on Concordia on Friday night at 7 p.m. They will then play against the alumni on Saturday at 4 p.m. in the Galen Center Pavilion instead of the usual home court because of scheduling conflicts.

Tucked away in a parking lot across from the Lyon Center, Lil Bill’s Bike Shop can be easy to miss. The shop, which resembles a plastic shed, has become a popular place for students to reinflate flat tires, purchase spare parts, or chat with “Lil Bill” himself: Aaron Flournoy, the shop’s owner. 
“The name comes from my dad, whose name is Bill, and he has been a pillar in this community for over 40 years,” Flournoy said. “He owned a bike shop down the street, but he sold the business. Everyone always called me little Bill, because Pops was always big Bill.”
The shop holds a strong place in the University Park Campus area, but according to David Donovan, an associate director of the USC Transportation Office, USC agreed to a non-compete clause with a new bike shop opening in USC Village this summer. Lil Bill’s Bike Shop will no longer remain on USC-owned property, leaving Flournoy in a state of uncertainty. 
“My dad is 81, so he’s selling his store and retiring,” Flournoy said. “This was a perfect opportunity for me to carry it on, and I thought it was going to be something good. But it’s turning out to be bad.” 
According to Donovan, the complications surrounding the establishment of Lil Bill’s Bike Shop can be traced back to last fall, when USC purchased the United University Church property. 
When Flournoy purchased the business under its original name, Tommy’s Bike Repair, the shop was originally located in the United University Church parking lot, a privately owned property at the time. This enabled the shop’s original owner, Micah Greenberg, to establish a contract with the church that allowed for a bike shop on its premises, which he passed on to Flournoy. 
However, when USC purchased the church property after years of negotiation, the contract became invalid and Flournoy was given until December 2016 to relocate, according to Donovan. 
Instead of requiring Flournoy to vacate USC entirely, Donovan was able to relocate him to a different spot on campus: in a parking lot at the corner of 34th Street and McClintock Avenue, where Flournoy has remained. But after the establishment of the non-compete clause, Flournoy is no longer allowed on USC property and must leave campus by April 30, according to Donovan.
“Finding him that space was just a courtesy,” Donovan said. “I like Aaron a lot, and we were trying to help him as much as we could just because of the circumstances he found himself in. Having said that, Aaron has known from the beginning that this was a temporary arrangement.” 
Though Lil Bill’s Bike Shop has only been on campus for less than a year, Flournoy and his family have been servicing the USC community for over 40 years. According to Flournoy, he and his father even built cardinal and gold bikes for the USC baseball team. 
“I have so much love for this campus and this school,” Flournoy said. “Everyone that’s met me knows how much me and my family love this school and stand behind it. And for USC to tell me to go, or that I’m no longer needed or welcome, I think is an injustice.” 
Flournoy is not the only one who is frustrated with the situation. Many students speculate that USC Village’s bike shop will not be as convenient or affordable as Lil Bill’s Bike Shop. An online petition has been created in response, and has collected 207 signatures and 42 comments as of March 23. 
“A lot of the time I feel like [USC’s] decisions are coming from the economic standpoint and not really from the social and cultural community that’s built around USC,” said Emma Schiewe, a senior majoring in art history and human biology and customer of Lil Bill’s Bike Shop. “I get money-wise it might be more economically satisfying for USC to have a bike store in the Village, but not only is the old shop more convenient, it’s also a smaller place where you don’t feel like you’re going to get cheated out of getting good parts and good prices.” 
The conflict between USC and Lil Bill’s Bike Shop has also sparked criticism toward USC’s treatment of small businesses in the surrounding community. 
“USC should protect small businesses,” said Jack Tenney, a freshman majoring in business administration. “[Fluorney] is really hardworking and people really appreciate how nice he is and how seriously he takes his job. I don’t think it’s right to put him out of work just so we can have a bigger bike shop.” 
Despite the criticism, Donovan believes there is a substantial amount of public misperception due to a lack of background information surrounding the situation between USC and Flournoy’s business. 
“I hate reading things that say USC is ‘kicking him out’ or ‘booting him off the property’ or other rhetoric like that,” Donovan said. “That really doesn’t serve any useful purpose because that’s not what’s happening.”
On the other hand, Flournoy, a South Central L.A. native,  sees USC’s commitment to supporting local businesses contradicted by its lack of action. 
“My family has been here in this community for so long, and all I ever heard was how USC wants to go out and help the community and help small mom-and-pop businesses, but I don’t see it happening,” Fluornoy said.
In addition to the non-compete clause, there are issues surrounding the placement of Lil Bill’s Bike Shop that require Flournoy to relocate. According to Donovan, the city of Los Angeles has identified the shop as an illegal business because it is operating out of parking lot and occupying a handicap space. 
“USC has tried to help him to the fullest extent possible, and he knows that,” Donovan said. “I don’t blame him for trying to do what he can to save his business, and I want him to be successful as a small businessman. He just can’t do it on USC property.”
Right now, Flournoy’s main priority is finding a permanent location for his shop and garnering public support. 
“I’m hoping that the president of the University or somebody who has the power to make decisions will understand my fight and my cause,” Flournoy said. 
He was basically being given free leasing space by the university in a space that is technically illegal under city code.  I see nothing wrong with this.  USC’s campus is private property.  
USC is a brand and they are obsessed with their image; from the faculty, the administrative staff, and down to the students. And this Lil Bill’s Bike Shop was a little brother that the school tolerated for a period of time. In essence, USC probably never really even wanted this bike shop there in the first place. 
I bet assorted USC employees probably in their bookkeeping, accounting and other departments probably were anonymously complaining about this bike shop and the way it looked amid the décor of the USC campus and said that the bike shop has to go. 
USC is a great school but also that school and Los Angeles Country period, is about money. That bike shop probably wasn’t making USC much money so they decided in 2017 that it has to go.
He is nice person who owns a very small business but there is no way of leasing him a space for free. And it is also impossible to have him on the side of the campus, with a temporary plastic house, staying forever. As USC mentions, both he and the university know that his status quo can only be temporary. So it is either him living under the courtesy of USC or him finding a place for his own. There is no way for USC to sacrifice for him. If there is one case like this, thousands are coming.

Last year, when USC students opened up their e-bills, they were greeted by an unexpected sight: Unbeknownst to them, their tuition had increased by $1,978 for the 2016-2017 academic year. This year, when USC released a statement announcing another 3.9 percent increase for the 2017-2018 academic year, students were irate at what many viewed as another unjustified hike.   
While the administration states that the hike is lower than it has been in previous years, tuition will be $2,006 more than last year and will total $53,448. 
Most students do not pay the full amount. Nearly two-thirds of undergraduate students benefit from some form of financial aid, according to the USC Financial Aid website. 
However, many feel that this is not enough to combat the tuition hikes.
David Delgado, a junior majoring in theatre production and gender studies, is worried that the tuition hikes could force him to work even harder or go into more debt. 
“I am able to attend USC predominantly by scholarships as well as financial aid,” Delgado said. “I already work way too much because I’m a low-income student with two jobs. It just puts more undue stress, especially on poor or financial aid students.”
Sajani Raja, a freshman studying health and human sciences major, is also concerned about the possible impact of the hike.
“My parents are paying for two kids going through college right now and that’s already enough of financial stress on my family,” Raja said. “I don’t know if USC can do anything to mitigate that cost, but at least they could tell us where the money is going.”
This year, in an effort to be more transparent, the University released a statement announcing the tuition hike. The University cited the importance of having a large financial aid pool.
“We want to create a high-touch environment that ensures all students have access to the world’s best faculty, academic programs that prepare them for the 21st Century, high-value internships and career services, and an exceptional residential college experience,” Provost Michael Quick said in a statement.  “I am proud that we provide ways to lessen the impact of a tuition increase with financial assistance so that we can continue to provide new and returning students with a challenging and relevant USC education.”
But Raja doesn’t think that that is enough.
“If there [was] a clearly stated reason for the increase in tuition, then perhaps I would be able to admit that the school needs students to pay more to meet its growing expenses, but the students have been told nothing,” Raja said. “The tuition hike essentially throws students who are already set to graduate with more debt than most of their peers in America under the bus with no justification.” 
Nadja Barlera, a senior majoring in English, thinks that transparency is just a small part of improving the tuition policy.
“This year they tried to release more information about it,” Barlera said. “But they’re still not doing what we asked for. They’re not listening to our demands in any significant way.” 
As a leader of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, Barlera hoped to drum up enough support to organize a rally. In response to the tuition hike last year, Barlera organized a protest after a student petition with 850 student signatures calling for a tuition freeze was unsuccessful.
Raja criticized the University’s response to student protests.
“It seems like the administration is very removed from student organizations, and that our voice doesn’t necessarily matter,” Raja said. “Even though there’s all this talk about the tuition hikes obviously they’re going to go through with it anyway.” 
As the University grapples with the issue of tuition in the coming years, Delgado thinks USC needs to refocus on its students.
“We, the students, have worked so hard to get USC where it is and without its students, a university is useless,” Delgado said.
Barlera hopes that the administration adopts a static tuition policy for all students, in which the cost would remain the same all throughout a student’s time at USC. 
“Students should have the same tuition for the whole time they’re in college,” Barlera said. “It shouldn’t change year to year.” 
Delgado hopes that the University will more fully address the needs of struggling students. 
“In the future, we should look to supporting our students instead of making a name for our University,” Delgado said. “[We should] stop the expansion, stop the promotion of how great USC is, and really look inward toward the University and solve the problems we have on the day to day.” 
Sofia Bosch contributed to this report.
Hmm, maybe people should stop advocating for ancillary and unnecessary administrative expansions? Studies have demonstrated the key factor in rising tuitions since the 70s has been the rise in administrative positions that don’t add anything to education (e.g. diversity offices, women’s offices, etc.).

After raising $22,120 through a GoFundMe account, a group of faculty members took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times on March 23 in order to publicly express their support for immigrants, international students and vulnerable members of the community. 
The ad, which was signed by 314 faculty members, professed to uphold the core values of the University, encourage University efforts to provide critical resources and protect the human rights of all members of the USC community. 
Ariela Gross, a professor of law and history at the USC Gould School of Law, established the GoFundMe account and was one of the main coordinators of the effort. 
“The first action we decided to take was to take out a full-page ad in the L.A. Times in order to express very publicly the strong support of a broad group of USC faculty for our immigrant communities and to urge and support our university administration’s effort to protect our students no matter what happens,” Gross said. 
Gross hoped that the ad would encourage the University to take direct action to implement policies and allot resources in order to show its support in a more overt manner. For example, Gross looked to set up resource centers specifically for immigrants and international students affected as well as establish emergency funds for legal counsel, with the goal of facilitating more cooperation between those in need of aid and those capable of providing aid. 
“We’re going to be scheduling teach-ins and training sessions for students and others in our community to be prepared for various contingencies, if they do happen,” Gross said. “We’re trying to have a more coordinative response as well in terms of the way we communicate on these issues to the outside world.”
Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano, said student response to the ad has been positive. Vela noted that his students exhibited appreciation and gratitude for the show of support. 
“I think there was a real excitement and appreciation to hear from faculty in support of students and in particular the more vulnerable students on campus,” Vela said. “In particular, I think one student saw that faculty were talking against discrimination, against bigotry, and really being supportive of our community. I can only see it as the Trojan family coming together.”
Vela hoped that the ad would open up more avenues of communication and spark productive discussion between the University’s staff and students that could lead to concrete action. 
“It’s more powerful when you have the University really engaging with our students and our student leaders,” Vela said. “That’s when you really have community because then you have discussion, you have dialogue. The Trojan family should be one where we can discuss and talk about things and use our critical thinking to come up with a plan together.” 
Tomás Mier contributed to this report.
As an alumnus (LAS 198-), if the USC administration starts harboring illegal aliens in the name of diversity and promotes breaking our immigration laws, I’ll stop sending checks. It’s as simple as that.
What the fuck is this even addressing? People with green cards and visas are allowed to stay in the US. Sure, I would love for every productive person to enter this country easily and become a citizen. But what the heck does this do? It’s one of the purest forms of social signaling. The DT’s editors are trash. This is so poorly written and so uninformative it sickens me as an editor of one of the most circulated and prestigious college newspapers in the countryl

There’s so much wrong with this. I don’t know where to begin, but I’ll start by rebuking people who continually and willfully conflate issues of legal and illegal immigration… as well as the issues of illegal immigration with studying internationally. International students are not illegal immigrants (unless of course they overstay their student visas, in which case there can be overlap). I’ll never understand people’s perverse, unbridled and sanctimonious obsession and support of people in the country illegally. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME.
When I was a young first-generation immigrant, people here illegally went about their business quietly and humbly, knowing they were in an unsustainable situation that could come to an end at any time. They realized there could be consequences for not being right with the law. Their humility was met largely with grace by the public. (Take, for example, the amnesty granted by Ronald Reagan in the 80’s.) Now however, illegal immigrants have been emboldened and empowered by a politically-motivated Left that has created an illegal-immigrant mafia that has weaved it’s way into everyday life, and public policy. Mafia is the correct word. Just look at the militant language and behaviour (“undocumented and unafraid”, waiving mexican flags, “demanding” everything from drivers licenses, to in-state tuition, heathcare, and even licenses to practice law in one case). Does anyone really wonder why much of America is pushing back? If their humility is gone, so too will our grace be withdrawn.
It’s funny… It used to be that an “immigration attorney” helped people understand and navigate immigration law in their journey to become Americans. Now apparently the job of an immigration attorney is to help people avoid and subvert immigration law.

Just one day after scouts from across the NFL flocked to USC’s campus for Pro Day, the football team returned to Howard-Jones Field on Thursday for its fifth spring ball workout this offseason. 
With just over three weeks remaining until its spring game, USC continued its preparation for the 2017 season on Thursday. 
Continuity a strength on defense
Head coach Clay Helton received high praise from his coaches and players for his ability to keep nearly all of his coaching staff from last season’s Rose Bowl-winning team intact over the offseason. 
The 2017 Trojan coaching staff features only one newcomer: former Indiana running backs coach Deland McCullough. McCullough is replacing Tommie Robinson, who departed from USC in the offseason to coach at LSU. 
“[Keeping the same coaching staff] really helps us,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “We obviously still have lots to do this spring, but keeping that continuity does help.”
A USC defense which held seven opponents to their season-low in points in 2016 has had the opportunity to further develop under Pendergast’s schemes. An offseason to study a familiar defensive playbook is helping players grasp concepts and trends from coaches. 
“It’s real helpful having the same playbook and the same schemes coming into this spring,” redshirt sophomore linebacker John Houston Jr. said. “It’s helped me a lot to know some of the schemes. I feel like I’m ready to just go full speed.” 
Redshirts showing promise
With Michael Hutchings graduating, Houston — who sat out the entirety of last season — has now been taking first-team reps this spring. Houston is considered a frontrunner for the starting inside linebacker position for the Trojans.
“[Houston] is doing a great job,” Helton said. “He’s always had the athleticism and the ability to track and get to the ball extremely quickly. He’s not done, and he’s not a finished product right now. But we are happy with where he currently is.”
USC’s defense also suffered a loss in the secondary this offseason, as former safety Leon McQuay III — who made the pivotal interception in January’s Rose Bowl — graduated. McQuay’s departure has opened the door for redshirt freshman safety Jamel Cook to garner some playing time in the secondary this season.
Cook’s 6-foot-3-inch, 195-pound physical frame has impressed many observing USC’s spring workouts. On several occasions through spring workouts, Cook has made some heavy hits on ball carriers, grabbing the attention of the media, teammates and coaches.
“[Cook’s] had flashes of real brilliance,” Helton said. “You’ve seen the explosiveness and physical nature that he brings. His length really makes things hard for smaller receivers.” 
Scrimmage Looming
This Saturday, the team will be participating in an intersquad scrimmage at Howard-Jones Field. The scrimmage will feature “live-tackling” among the players, Helton confirmed. 
A large portion of Thursday’s practice was devoted to installing play-calling systems in preparation for the upcoming scrimmage this weekend. Forecasts show that there is a slight chance of rain Saturday morning, when the scrimmage would be taking place. 
Star Power
Several famous faces and figures in the USC community made their way to Howard-Jones Field Thursday to watch the Trojans practice. 
Former USC Heisman-winning quarterback and NFL Pro-Bowler Carson Palmer and former All-Pac-10 USC defensive end Lawrence Jackson were in attendance.
Just one day after participating in Pro Day workouts, former USC receivers Juju Smith-Schuster and De’Quan Hampton were also present on Thursday. 
On Wednesday, former USC head coach and current Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll attended USC Pro Day on Cromwell Field. Carroll and Helton had the opportunity to chat during the workout. 
“Anytime you get to be around someone who is a great coach [in] Carroll, you try to get things from them, and I did,” Helton said. “I really appreciate him. He’s been great to me ever since I got the job here.”

Anyone who has played youth sports has probably had the misfortune of dealing with overzealous parents being far too involved with their children — the soccer mom yelling at the referees, the irritating dad telling the coach to put his kid in the game — or perhaps the even greater misfortune of having one of those parents.
Now, imagine being a star high school or college athlete and still having that kind of parent — except his words are being published in the national media.
Meet LaVar Ball: father of Lonzo Ball, the stud UCLA freshman guard, and LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball, both high schoolers already committed to UCLA. There’s no question the three brothers are good at basketball, but I doubt they asked for their father to tout each of them as the next greatest thing.
In case you haven’t been exposed to LaVar’s comments, here’s a brief tasting: He claimed that Lonzo, who he said will be drafted No. 1 overall this summer and will win a national championship in a few weeks, is better than Stephen Curry, more athletic than Magic Johnson, has a better jump shot than Jason Kidd and can beat LeBron James and Russell Westbrook in a 5-on-5.
He said his three sons will sign a collective shoe deal worth $1 billion. Oh, and as for himself, he believes he would have beaten Michael Jordan 1-on-1 in his “heyday” (just for kicks, LaVar averaged 2.2 points a game in 1987-1988 with Washington State, his only season of recorded stats. Jordan scored 35 points a game for the Chicago Bulls that same season.)
As good as Lonzo may be, all of those players he is being compared to are current or former NBA superstars. Lonzo is a college freshman. And no, playing one season of college basketball and literally scoring a single basket a game does not even qualify you to have a “heyday.” Jordan right now, at age 54, would destroy LaVar in his supposed “prime.”
Dare I say, LaVar Ball is the Donald Trump of sports dads. While LaVar’s comments have no real-world implications, they reach a lot of people, they confuse readers like a Trump tweet (check the #LaVarBallSays hashtag on Twitter) and they carry a lot of weight on their intended targets: his sons.
Think about Lonzo. He is objectively one of the best players in college basketball right now. He exhibits the poise and patience that few college point guards possess and has the intuitiveness to see the right play before it develops, and yet he can take over the game adeptly with his athleticism and unlimited range.
He likely has a stellar NBA career ahead of him, but … What if he doesn’t? A lot of high draft picks don’t pan out to be the franchise players they were projected to be. Greg Oden, selected No. 1 overall in 2007, was touted as a once-in-a-generation talent, but recurring injuries ended his career prematurely. Darko Milicic, drafted No. 2 in 2003 between LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, is currently a farmer in Serbia. Sam Bowie, picked first in 1984, played in just 139 games and is relevant only because he was selected before a guy named Michael Jordan. And don’t ask me how many awful top draft selections my Warriors have made over the years (do you have any idea who Joe Smith is? Exactly).
The point is, for LaVar Ball to play up his son like this is doing Lonzo a disservice. It is piling on a mountain of expectations, most of which seem impossible to meet. It is telling a 19-year-old kid that he is the next coming of Jordan. It is taking away Lonzo’s control of his own career narrative, which is shameful. Try typing “Lonzo Ball” into Google and you’ll find the suggested result “Lonzo Ball dad” second from the top.
From the small sample size of how much I’ve seen of Lonzo, he seems to be a calm, confident person who doesn’t let his emotions get the best of him, which will come handy for when his father inevitably dispels his next inaccurate prediction (heck, maybe Lonzo Ball will also walk on the moon by the end of the year or something). He clearly has the talent to be a star in the NBA, but will need the thick skin to stomach the expectations that are guaranteed to come with his father’s mouth and ego.
He’ll hear it from opponents, from fans, from passers-by on the street: “Hey, the next Steph Curry!” People will critique him much more than others, harp on his every misstep, trash talk him and tear him down if his career doesn’t go exactly as expected and predicted by his father. To wit, after Lonzo committed a turnover in the Pac-12 tournament semifinal against Arizona earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times quoted a fan as yelling from the stands, “Hey, Steph Curry wouldn’t have done that!”
Lonzo Ball should not be known as the next Steph Curry, nor should he be seen solely as LaVar Ball’s kid. Lonzo Ball is the next Lonzo Ball, and he and his brothers deserve to write their own fate, to weave their own path, to do the best they can in the NBA — or whatever level of basketball they wind up at — and not be judged for it because of their old man’s idiotic comments.
Eric He is a sophomore studying print and digital journalism. He is also an associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Grinding Gears,” runs on Fridays.
Eric, why would you write about that A-hole Lavar Ball on the USC paper? Sickening how much press he gets
from the L.A. Times in their sports section. This is as bad as all the free pub President Trump received during the
primaries and election. So many sports programs at USC that can be discussed and analyzed for better or worse.
Hopefully the ncaa will find something to throw at the ‘ruins now that the High Priest John Wooden is long gone from
the scene.

A lot has happened since the women’s water polo team past played a game at home. In the last six weeks, the Trojans have traveled across the Southland, up north and to the islands of Hawaii, tacking on 13 more wins to regain the top spot in every national poll and setting a new national women’s water polo record with their 47th consecutive victory over spring break.
On Thursday, that streak was extended to 49 in a row as the No. 1 Trojans (22-0) defeated visiting No. 10 Princeton (16-2) in a non-conference tilt, 12-3, at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
The Trojans were posed with a tough task in going up against Princeton goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson, who had been averaging just 3.5 goals-against per game this season after leading Team USA to a gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. However, not even she could stop a blistering Trojan offense that came out of the gates on fire in the first half.
Four different Trojans scored in the opening frame to give USC a quick 6-0 advantage, led by freshman utility Maud Megens’ hat trick. In the second period, solid defending resulted in numerous field blocks and steals that led to USC goals, including strikes from senior two-meter Brigitta Games and junior utility Hayley McKelvey. Eventually, two more goals by Megens extended the lead to 10-1, as she accounted for half of USC’s goals scored by the end of the half.
It was a defensive battle in the third frame, as the Trojans were held to just one goal scored by freshman driver Denise Mammolito with 48 seconds left. However, USC also held Princeton scoreless to take the commanding 11-1 lead into the final period. Princeton would punch in two more goals, but one more score by junior driver Brianna Daboub would make the final tally 12-3 in favor of the Trojans. In all, seven different Trojans scored on the afternoon, led by Megens with five goals and Daboub with two.
Although Megens’ hot hand helped the Trojans outpace the Tigers on the offensive end, she credits her team’s passing and defense as the difference makers in Thursday’s match.
“I think we started with good defense as a team, and from that defense we had fast breaks and some good transitions,” Megens said. “We got some great passes from side to side and we really made their goalie move, which allowed us to score.”
Daboub, too, noted that the defensive adjustments the team made before and during the game were key in the victory.
“I think when we were back in Hawaii last week, we kind of got away from the fundamentals and our defense,” Daboub said. “So this week, we really focused on getting back to the fundamentals on defense and just doing the little things right, and I thought today was a much better effort on everyone’s part.”
And while much of the hype surrounded the Tigers’ goalie on the defensive end, it was USC’s pair of netminders who stole the show. Sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan put up seven saves in the first half, while junior goalie Victória Chamorro had four saves in the cage to close out the game.
With the victory, the Trojans remain perfect on the season at 22-0 and improve to 3-0 all-time against the Tigers, while the visitors fall to 16-2 overall and had their four-match winning streak snapped by USC.
The Trojans will now get to stay in their home water for the weekend as they gear up for a pair of matches at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center this Saturday. The doubleheader will begin with a conference tilt against No. 14 San Jose State (9-13) at 1 p.m. PST, followed directly after by a non-conference match against No. 18 Hartwick (10-5) at approximately 2:30 p.m. PST. USC owns a combined 42-0 record against the two opponents in the all-time series and will look to extend its record-winning streak to 51 games in a row.

This season, USC took part in the NCAA fanfare, making its first appearance past the Round of 64 in the tournament since 2009. Head coach Andy Enfield’s Trojans’ tournament march drew plenty of eyeballs, but behind the scenes, it also contributed toward the $21 million and counting the Pac-12 has earned thus far from the 2017 NCAA Tournament — money that winds its way back to USC and other schools in the conference.
Such money could be reallocated to fund coaches’ salaries, which can range into the millions. This is understandable—good coaches attract star recruits, and a splashy salary pulls in the best coaches throughout the nation. But this precedent places an undue emphasis upon sports. And when more money is pocketed by coaches than the adjunct faculty of our institution, the University misses its mark.
In an overwhelming majority of states, the highest-earning public employee is a football or basketball head coach. University of Michigan head football coach Jim Harbaugh tops the list with an annual income of $9 million, and three of his assistants earn $1 million a year.
USC is not absent from this trend. Though football head coach Clay Helton’s salary has yet to be disclosed, his predecessor, Steve Sarkisian, made $3.6 million a year — a number that’s almost three times what President C.L. Max Nikias earns. Enfield reportedly inked a $1.5 million-a-year deal when he left Florida Gulf Coast University. And according to the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis database, the average head coach salary for USC men’s sports teams is $534,645.
While athletic programs are many universities’ main profit-drawing centers— USC Athletics has raked in at least $100 million a year for the past three years — the income disparity between adjunct faculty and head coaches is astonishing. The top head coaches may earn in the millions, but their salaries dwarf that of adjunct professors, who earn an average of $20,000 to $126,000 each year.
Nationwide, adjunct professors feel the void of the job security and benefits afforded to full-time faculty. Many often have to hold teaching positions at multiple universities just to have a dignified lifestyle — in an interview with NPR, artist Dushko Petrovich detailed his cumbersome commute between New York University, Yale, Rhode Island School of Design and Boston University, all places where he holds professorships.
Faculty have already voiced discontent with the University. Last fall, Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences faculty filed charges against USC, alleging that the “business model of education” left many of them  economically insecure with low wages and few benefits. Not only has there been little resolution to the issue thus far, but the University has also condemned the USC Faculty Union — a group of non-tenure track professors, aiming for higher pay and more secure contracts.
As such, the University should reevaluate its focus on the distribution of salaries. The athletics program generates a massive profit and students are paying the highest tuition yet, but adjunct faculty still aren’t being paid enough. The University must relinquish some of its emphasis on the athletics program, and that starts with reconsidering the vast amount of money they pay some head coaches each year. Otherwise, it’s pitting sports against academia.
School sports are an integral part of collegiate life. We feel the energy in the football and basketball stands, and it draws strangers closer to one another. What is not in the Trojan spirit, however, is leaving our professors — the pillars of our education — sidelined. 
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
What you commenters and those who like the comments of Lunderful and Magnum P.I. fail to realize is that this is an editorial/opinion piece. So in essence the writers of this piece wanted to express their opinion on the astronomical salaries of football and basketball coaches.
So what that adjunct, full-time and tenured professors don’t bring in butt loads of money to USC as football and b-ball coaches do. These professors are the people who educate these athletes and the regular student body to become leaders, somebodies, doctors, lawyers, educators, and etc. of tomorrow.
I aint saying professors should be getting paid $1 million or more per year. But for all teachers have to put up with, how hard it is to be an educator, and the fact that if it weren’t for professors aint none of these USC students would be prepared for the real world, these professors should be getting a much higher percentage of the revenue pie that USC generates per fiscal year.  
I don’t blame these professors for wanting to file charges against USC or speaking out more on their salaries. Teaching is one of the most underpaid and underappreciated professions in the country, and colleges and high schools STILL don’t care or understand that.
The point of your first paragraph is meaningless.  Every article by the Editorial Board or in the Opinion section is simply an expression of opinion.  The comments section is provided so that readers like “Lunderful” or “Magnum P.I” or others can post their opinions of agreement or disagreement.  
I agree with you that many in the teaching profession are underpaid, but be careful comparing apples with oranges.  Not all educators are the same.  Indeed many are deserving of higher salaries, but by that same measure, many are being paid too much.  Generally, I would like to see teachers and professors in the humanities making more money, certainly commensurate with their credentials.  Educators in other fields should face greater and more subjective scrutiny.  Anyone caught trashing science by peddling the transgender lie should be fired on the spot.
I hope you will one day take an economics class or become a critical thinker. Sports success increases endowments. Investing in overpaid Gender Studies professors who don’t equip students to get jobs doesn’t help anyone. Check yourself.
Many coaches represent revenue.  Few faculty represent revenue, but rather propaganda.

Though you could probably fill an entire Merriam-Webster Dictionary with conservative hypocrisies, their incessant primal screaming about government spending is probably one of their biggest (and most tiresome) harping points in all of New Deal politics. The most recent example, of course, is the national embarrassment that is President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal. 
The budget is perhaps one of the most insidious and disappointing pieces of legislation the GOP has produced yet. The fact that it hasn’t passed yet doesn’t take away from the importance of the attempt to convert something this ludicrous into veritable law; the intention behind the budget is more terrifyingly indicative of the GOP’s proposed direction than anything we have seen. 
Unfortunately for millions of Americans across states, social stations and political affiliations, advocates of this proposed budget abandon the constituents they pretend to serve — those same constituents they avoid at their own town hall meetings, in their own districts. Most importantly, the budget betrays the very purpose of legitimate industrialized government. 
In general, the government exists to uphold an agreement among constituents to come together under representative government for the protection of their rights and general fulfillment of their needs — needs otherwise incapable of being satisfied alone. The society agrees to share the burden of caring for its sick, educating its children, building its businesses and protecting its private property.
However, for those right-wingers and lovely libertarians who endlessly benefit from government-provided, federally subsidized infrastructure, schools, hospitals, programming, clean water, clean air, higher education grants, food and health regulations, police, emergency services, health and safety programs, medical assistance and standardized utilities — but don’t feel obligated to pay for any of it — I highly recommend Somalia. You will love it. There is almost no government and no roads. Four-wheel drive into your Chris McCandless heaven. 
And what are the programs the budget seeks to cut first? Grants that fund Meals on Wheels for elderly people and disabled adults, lunch programs for underprivileged kids, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Public Broadcasting Service, aid for college students, public school in general, along with summer school programs and public housing, legal services for the poor, the National Endowment for the Arts, the NIH and AmeriCorps. Most of these things comprise a tiny portion of the total budget. Defense spending, which received a generous increase under the new budget, accounts for 54 percent. 
Meanwhile, the president goes on weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago that cost the government around $3 million each and his wife and son will remain in New York, costing the government almost $1 million per week. If you think businessman Eric Trump’s $100,000 trip to Uruguay was worth your tax dollars, but lunch programs for children aren’t, feel free to seek some of that Affordable Care Act-covered mental health treatment. For the right-wingers who pretend the government’s finally cutting the fat, let’s remember the two useless wars and trillion-dollar tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent that the GOP has found suitable to credit with tax dollars, and understand exactly how inconsequential the gutted programs were to both creating the debt and paying it off.
This is not a matter of political belief, or politics as usual. Take the aforementioned programs, for example. For some underprivileged kids, free or reduced-price lunch in school is the first time, and often the only time, they will eat that day. Without Meals on Wheels, many elderly Americans would quite literally starve. Legal assistance for the poor is a necessity of equality before the law. Public education, for many, is the only available education. Grants don’t just make higher education easier — they make it possible. PBS promotes reading and mathematics; its programs support English language learning for children as young as four. I am shocked and appalled by this budget. It is an ideological statement of cruelty. 
Trump’s budget is a step toward a dysfunctional second-tier democracy and just a step away from depraved heart murder. It is pointless, callous and irresponsible. The GOP had eight years during which it could have been developing better health care and budgetary alternatives. Instead, they twiddled their thumbs, caused a government shutdown and subjected the world to Sen. Ted Cruz’s dramatic readings of Green Eggs and Ham. 
In the meantime, call your representatives. Do not sit by while your rights and privileges, as well as those of your low-income fellow Americans — who also deserve the protection of their common needs, and also pay taxes and contribute to this nation — are easily and crudely disregarded. 
Lily Vaughan is a sophomore majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs every Friday.
I wish I had time to fact-check everything, but I’ll start with the “school lunches”.  In fact, the reduction for food for poor children is actually a cut in funding for the international McGovern-Dole Food for Education program.  This program provides services in other countries, not in this country.  The author of this article obviously doesn’t know this.  Furthermore, it is honestly debatable whether it has been a successful program.
In this country, the domestic  after-school program that feeds children is not at risk, at least according to the NY Times.  Additionally, the WIC budget will continue to be over $6 billion, and there is no plan to eliminate school lunches.
Ms. Vaughn needs to spend less time coming up with alliteration like “lovely libertarian” and do more research.  I have commented before that less vitriol and more content (and more accurate content) would make for a far more persuasive essay.
I was going to wait to read this entire article to provide a legitimate rebuke of your views, but after reading “Though you could probably fill an entire Merriam-Webster Dictionary with conservative hypocrisies,” and seeing your picture it’s really not worth it. Typical unattractive liberal. Post scriptum: One of the worst and lest convincing pieces I’ve ever read. You must read picture books regularly. “The society agrees to share the burden of caring for its sick, educating its children, building its businesses and protecting its private property.” One of the many statements that you make that is simply unfounded. The United States Constitution doesn’t provide for any of this, except maybe protecting private property. But your order of operations reveals your deep biases and ignorance of the structure of our government.

Twenty-one years ago, a little-known director by the name of Danny Boyle (who went on to make Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours) worked on a small project in Scotland named Trainspotting with actor Ewan McGregor. 
It became a cult classic around the world and was one of the defining films of the late 20th century. Its realistic depiction of heroin addiction frightened yet enthralled audiences, forging audiences’ emotional attachments to the gang of Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie.
 Now, in 2017, Boyle, McGregor and the whole gang are back in the highly-anticipated sequel. T2 Trainspotting had its wide release this week in the United States. Mark Renton (McGregor) has returned to Edinburgh, sober from heroin for 20 years, and meets up with his former pals. Chaos and confusion ensues, much like the first film. 
That’s the first and major problem with T2  — its similarity to the original storyline. Many of the characters perform similar actions and are getting into the same shenanigans, but this time with a lot more ridiculousness because they’re in their 40s. 
There is little character development even throughout the 20-year window. An effort was made to improve on Renton’s character, but he quickly returns to his old mannerisms and characteristics by the end of the first act.
It is odd that the film is a  relapse of the original. The tactic is usually saved for sequels to big blockbusters, but Trainspotting was never huge in the box office. It felt like this was the rare sequel that was made for actual artistic purpose, given that Irvine Welsh, the author of the book Trainspotting, wrote a sequel novel this movie is loosely based. 
But, the film plays off a nostalgia the audience has for the first film by using its original footage at certain parts, striving to communicate themes that were missed in the script. The film touches on ideas of age and regret, but the story is not captivating enough to truly uphold them. The famous “choose life” mantra of the original was spelled out during a conversation between Renton and Veronika (Anjela Nedyalkova), a new character, in an egregious offense of telling but not showing.
The saving grace that could have made the film a success is how the director captured of the style and energy of the original. Trainspotting had a relatively innovative design with its rapid-fire editing, jump cuts and freeze frames, which brought the film to life. 
At the beginning of T2, Boyle seemingly returns to that style, but then he develops a more realistic feel, including those cut-ins to the previous film. The decreased heroin use and slower film pace weakens the style. This lack of energy is disappointing, given Boyle’s known talent behind the camera.
 The film is not truly terrible — there is still an amount of craftsmanship behind it with great Edinburgh locations and decent cinematography: It is also nice to see these characters that many have an emotional connection to after all this time. The only actor that truly feels like they are doing something beyond the original structure of their characters is Spud (Ewen Bremner), who displays a sense of anguish while also trying to do something real with his life. Also, the nostalgia appeal may work for some who saw the original in theatres and have a sentimentality to it.
 But in the end, T2 Trainspotting is a disappointing creative imitation of the original that breaks no new ground for the characters. It does not have nearly as gripping a story or style as the original.

The movie What’s Your Number came out in 2011 during my sophomore year of high school. There was a lot of buzz about it among my classmates. It wasn’t because we were enthralled by Anna Faris’ quirky personality or Chris Evans’ good looks.
It was because a kid from our school two years younger than us played a flashback role for the main character and was deemed the coolest kid in school for about a week. And though his scene was left on the cutting room floor, he appeared in television versions. So one afternoon, I watched the movie just to spot Cody on the small screen. But I was left with something much more lasting: The idea that something terrible happens to women if they sleep with too many men.
 Spoiler alert for What’s Your Number: After Faris reads a magazine article saying that 96 percent of women who’ve slept with 20 or more men are unlikely to find a husband, she goes back and to try again with all of her exes. Turns out, however, that she didn’t actually have sex with one of them. So it’s totally fine that she falls for Evans. Yes, in the end, she finds the perfect guy at number 20. Perfect.
 There are reasons for my hesitancy about my “number” that go far beyond Faris’ hijinks. There’s the fact that I’ve heard guys calling it a “body count” while my girlfriends sometimes have lied to their doctors to make themselves seem more innocent. 
There’s the fact that a partner who emotionally abused me had a particular emphasis on my three one-night stands. And I remember feeling deeply uncomfortable the moment my eighth partner asked me how many people I’d slept with. When I said “eight,” he responded with “four.” Clearly, in his eyes, the girl wasn’t supposed to have the higher number. He then comforted me as if there was something I should have been ashamed of.
 On the other hand, I also feel we’ve been taught that the more girls a guy has slept with, the more we should be expected to please him. I cowered at the idea of how many partners my last boyfriend had — not for any rational reason, but because of this underlying shame. 
How primitive is it that we compare ourselves to other women based on how many men we’ve had sex with? Even the idea of counting barely makes sense. Freshman year, I would only give oral sex to boys when I was worried that I had been acting too promiscuous lately. Oral sex is no less safe. It is no less intimate. And it no more affects who I am as a woman than the number of men I’ve slept with.
 Yet I struggle because when I decided I wanted to touch on this issue, I almost wanted to keep my number out of the article. By writing it, I am not celebrating the concept of the number. However, I am also not asking the number to be erased from our minds. Personally, I remember every partner because sex is intimate and memorable for me. Some keep track for health reasons. Some don’t (more power to you, I can’t keep track of everyone I have kissed). What I want is for us to be neutral on the subject.
 Recently, I read an article quoting therapist and body activist Anastasia Amour that talked about “body neutrality.” 
Body neutrality helps women recover by encouraging them not to hate their bodies, but to also avoid trying to radically love them. Amour encourages
neutrality and acceptance. As an eating
disorder and cancer survivor, I found this striking. In a similar way, neutrality about one’s “number” also appeals to me.
 My number is 11. And it will probably go up soon.
 Also, to be honest, I am not yet neutral on the subject. The devil on my shoulder is 15-year-old me, sitting there with Anna Faris, telling me that I’ll probably find my soul mate before No. 20, and if around No. 15 I start to find trouble in love, I should slow down with how much sex I am having. 
That’s ridiculous. I don’t celebrate the No. 11. That’s simple because not all of it was good. But I’m hoping I can regret two of them (No. 4 and No. 7 in particular) without assuming I’d be any better off with a number of nine.
 So here’s to neutrality. And fewer movies and 20-minute serials about keeping your number down. For example, the way Barney behaved in How I Met Your Mother was unlikeable, but I want both young women and young men to feel less inclined toward disgust at the punch line of his 200th woman. It might sound silly, but that may make people more comfortable when a girl has been with 20 men.

You’ve only slept with 11 people? I can see why because you’re so insufferable. Women are judged by a different standard because it’s easier for them to have sex. Women don’t have to court men, men have to court women. Men have a harder time dating and hooking up with people. You’re privileged in this respect so you should check your privilege.
