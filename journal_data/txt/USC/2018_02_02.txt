After working with the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund for 11 years, Christina Yokoyama concluded her last day as Topping director Thursday.

For nearly a month, Topping scholars organized several efforts to reverse the University’s decision to eliminate Yokoyama’s position. However, the provost’s office stood by its decision to enforce these structural changes in order to expand the program, the University stated.
“We will be working with the governing board, current students, alumni and student governments to expand the Topping Fund while maintaining the programming and support that are the hallmarks of its success,” Andrea Hodge, the vice provost of undergraduate programs, said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “This growth will allow a larger number of undergraduate and graduate students with high financial need and a commitment to community service to become Topping Scholars.”
Topping scholars, colleagues and faculty members gathered at Student Union for a farewell reception for Yokoyama on Thursday. At the reception, Yokoyama thanked scholars for their unwavering support and determination following the University’s elimination of her position.
“It was a rough day because this is not going to be my normal routine anymore,” Yokoyama said. “It was really hard but really wonderful at the same time. I think that was necessary for me to move on to my next step … to have a sense of closure.”
Topping scholar Melissa Baldjieva, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said that many attendees also helped Yokoyama clear out her office and load boxes of her belongings into her car. 
While the Topping program hosts several events in the office for the scholars, the turnout at the reception was exceptionally high, Baldjieva said. 
“The Topping office was full, and there was barely a place to sit,” Baldjieva said. “It just comes to show how important Christina was to our people.”
As for the future of the Topping Fund, Hodge called for a Topping Governing Board meeting on Feb. 15, Yokoyama said. She and the Board members said they are unaware of what will be discussed at the meeting.
Topping scholar Sabrina Enriquez, a senior majoring in mathematics, said she has been meeting with Hodge and Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry to transfer the jurisdiction of the Topping Fund from the University’s Office of Undergraduate Programs to Student Affairs. Enriquez said that Carry watched the #SaveTopping rally on Jan. 18, and spoke with Enriquez about potentially making the switch. 
“[He] knows students are distressed and his staff had been telling him how a lot of Topping students were going to the cultural centers more because they’re no longer comfortable with the Topping options,” Enriquez said. “He was interested in seeing how he could help his students.”
Enriquez said that if the Topping Fund moved under Dr. Carry’s leadership, “a lot of the problems that [the scholars] have with Hodge’s leadership will be addressed.” 
According to Yokoyama, the Topping Fund was originally a program within the Division of Student Affairs but was later categorized as a financial aid program. In 2013, the Topping Fund was relocated to the University’s Undergraduate Programs. 
“I think Student Affairs will be a much better fit,” Yokoyama said. “I think there will strictly be academic support which you could find anywhere at this University, but it’s the emotional support and the balance of the two that makes this program so special.”
The next few weeks will focus on further internal structure review of the Topping program with Carry and the provost’s office.
“People [are] feeling like we lost and the fight is over, but I want to emphasize that by no means is the fight over as far as we’re concerned,” Enriquez said.

Catherine Pérez describes herself as a first-generation student in every sense of the word. 
Photo of Catherine Pérez from USC News.
“I’m first-generation … high school graduate, first-generation college, first-generation doctoral program,” she said.
Pérez, a Ph.D. candidate studying gerontology at the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, is researching health disparities with regard to different social determinants. Though her research is with older adults, the information she has gathered about socioeconomics has allowed her to observe the importance of such issues among first-generation students.
She uses population-level data to compare health patterns across demographic indicators. Pérez’s educational background has allowed her to observe patterns that are visible in first-generation students who, when given inadequate support, can find college difficult.
Through her research, Pérez has evaluated how inadequate support for first-generation students can make college difficult.
“[We must think] about how that chronic stress builds up and how it affects life course outcomes,” she said. “We know that stress is also strongly associated with depression and anxiety and these are issues that lead students to drop out of school and this impacts life chances because education is associated with income, occupational status and health.”
When Pérez first began her research, she was interested in delving deeper into the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantages and health.
“I read and have done my own research that the association is that being socioeconomically disadvantaged is what affects health,” she said. “Why things are socially patterned the way that they are is basically how it influences [people] and you have to dig deeper looking at association.”
The success of first-generation minority students is dependent on available resources, she said.
“I think it’s important to point out first-generation students do require more resources at least at the university level just because statistically speaking first-generation students are more likely to be poor compared to [other students] on the campus,” Pérez said. “[They] are also more likely to not have been adequately prepared for college.”
She was motivated to pursue this research by her own role as a first-generation student and as a daughter of Puerto Rican and Honduran immigrants.
“[I wanted to get] more of that sense, more of that hyper-awareness of how identity really affects health,” Pérez said. 
Pérez first began exploring her interest in minority groups and health as an undergraduate at UCLA, where she took classes in Chicano studies and health disparities. 
It was further developed after she took interest in sociology of health and medicine.
“I started to see there are these really vast differences in health outcomes,” Pérez said. “I became very interested and concerned because if we’re not in our optimal health how are we supposed to do anything? If you’re sick you can’t work; if you’re sick you can’t help take care of other people; if you’re sick you can’t take time for yourself to develop or find your life purpose.”
Pérez’s research is primarily quantitative. She takes secondary data sets from sources like the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study and the National Center for Health Statistics’ National Health Interview Survey and analyzes them using computer programs such as Stata or Mplus. 
Usually, she formulates her research questions on variables she is interested in and the story she is trying to tell.
“We can make inferences about the population at large,” Pérez said. “We can uncover patterns of what’s going on in our nation’s societies. [I fell in love with] understanding how we can take larger communities of people and understand what is going on at a national level and understand how macro- and micro-level influences are working simultaneously to produce these health differentials that we observe.”

After delaying the publication of a transcript from a hearing regarding allegations against the Mai & Brianna campaign, the Undergraduate Student Government released a transcript Thursday revealing that the Debbie & Blake ticket had filed the complaint.
In the complaint, the Debbie & Blake campaign said that the Mai & Brianna campaign had violated Elections Code VII.A and VIII.A, alleging that the opposing campaign received help designing a graphic from somebody outside of their core five team before official campaigning began on Jan. 25.
The Election Commission, which facilitated the hearing on Monday, released a verdict on Wednesday, finding that “no infraction occurred” within the Mai & Brianna campaign.
The transcript reveals that in the hearing, the Debbie & Blake campaign presented a social media caption from the student who allegedly designed Mai & Brianna’s graphics. The caption stated that the designer had the “opportunity to design all the graphics for the MB 2018 team campaign.”
The Mai & Brianna campaign responded to these allegations by stating that the designer had no knowledge that the graphics were for the official campaign, but rather that they were for a school project.
The Mai & Brianna campaign presented a letter from the designer as evidence.
“Prior to January 25 at 7 PM, I had NO KNOWLEDGE that Mai and Brianna were running for office through USG,” the email read. “I’m deeply sorry for any trouble that I have caused and hope this matter will be resolved as soon as possible.”
In a verdict published Wednesday, the Election Commission stated, “The petitioners could not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the respondent’s had violated Elections Code.” 
Following the publication of the verdict, the Daily Trojan requested an official transcript copy of Monday’s hearing at the USG office Wednesday afternoon, but was denied.
According to the Elections Code XIII.D, “a written copy of the transcript will be released to both the general public and the press.”
USG’s statement also said that the Elections Code required that the transcript be made available within “the 24-hour window,” but no such timeframe is listed in the Elections Code. Instead, the code states that “the transcript shall be available in the USG office for public consumption as soon as a verdict is reached.”
In a statement sent to the Daily Trojan on Thursday after the release of the transcripts, USG extended “its deepest apologies” for the delayed release of the hearing transcript. 
“Due to unforeseen circumstances and technical difficulties, the hearing transcript was released the morning of Thursday,” the USG statement read. “The USG Elections and Recruitment team are ardently working on developing a more efficient method of releasing future hearing transcripts.”

The USC administration has opened an investigation into a Delta Tau Delta fraternity party held last Friday following a Daily Trojan report which included photos and testimonies from students at the party, who indicated that some found the theme racially insensitive.
Photos obtained by the Daily Trojan.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said that the decision to investigate the fraternity came after seeing the photos of the “Black Friday” party published in the newspaper. 
“I was disheartened by the photos that I’ve seen reportedly taken last week at a fraternity party,” Carry said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “USC takes these matters very seriously and we have opened an investigation.” 
The photos obtained by the Daily Trojan depict a poster from the party bearing the phrase “For the Culture” written on it, and the name “Jemimah” spray-painted on the side of a table. Multiple sources also said they saw graffiti on the walls at the party, and that many of the fraternity’s members were wearing basketball jerseys. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan sent prior to Carry’s statement, Delta Tau Delta treasurer Mario Blanco said the fraternity did not intend to offend anyone. 
“If any elements were interpreted as being offensive, it was not our intent and we certainly apologize,” Blanco said in the statement. “Our fraternity places great value on cultural diversity and respect.” 
Carry, in his statement, referenced the USC Principles of Community, which say that “ignorance or ‘it was just a joke’ will not be excuses for insensitive behavior.”
“Even if the organizers did not start out meaning to offend, the result is offensive,” Carry said.
Multiple sources who spoke to the Daily Trojan after attending the party, however, said they saw nothing unusual while they were there. 
Though some attendees said they remember posters, they could not remember the exact phrases on them. Others indicated that they interpreted the theme as referring to black lights present in the house for the party. 
Delta Tau Delta did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding USC’s newly announced investigation. 
The Interfraternity Council also did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the investigation.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
I missed Texas very deeply, for a long time. It’s a proud and distinctive place, gritty and charming in its mix of sprawling cities and rolling hills. I won’t sugarcoat anything — maybe that’s a marker of Texanhood — I spent my childhood in Austin primarily bored, hot and waiting to escape, painfully itching to grow up, fantasizing about Los Angeles and New York and all the places that would bear nothing in common with home. But I still remember driving back from a friend’s ranch outside the city in the early evening — a photographer friend tells me this is called the “Golden Hour” — shuttling along on a two-lane road, facing nothing but expanse. My mother looked up at a blood-orange sunset and said to me, “There won’t be skies like this anywhere else.” She was right. There aren’t.
I’ve met more Texans at USC than anywhere else I’ve been since I left. Countless friends from Dallas, a classmate from New Braunfels, a couple from Waco and Houston here and there. There’s a camaraderie in these meetings I can’t really describe, a sense that you both feel that same grief. It’s a peculiar feeling, to miss a place so wonderfully proud and idiosyncratic and yet with so many problems to fix. All this love and disappointment and nostalgia is summed up somehow in the same conversation — “Is it already hot back there?” “Yeah, it’s getting hot.” 
Texas, by its very size and nature, is a place brimming with different walks of life — they sound different, act differently, need different things. To represent it is to forge a future that can include everybody, that plans on including everybody. That’s not something you can just achieve with the slightest hint of a twang and a firm handshake. Like the state itself, Texas’ best public servants — President Lyndon B. Johnson and former Gov. Ann Richards among them — have something about them, something more, an ability to encapsulate a greater unity and not just a mock-up of what a ‘Texan’ ought to look like. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the congressman from Waco and underdog candidate for Senate (chasing Sen. Ted Cruz), is one of them. Texans at USC, we’ve got to get behind Beto. 
O’Rourke is looking toward the state as a whole, and his platform reflects it. The Texan public education system for years has fallen off in myriad ways and varies wildly depending on county, city and district. The state is a major economic powerhouse, and yet many Texans still don’t see any benefit from its boons; vast amounts of the state population still don’t have affordable health care. Immigration is nowhere as relevant a subject as in Texas. O’Rourke also recognizes, like other great Texan statesmen before him, that these issues intersect. 
He’s put forward a comprehensive plan to boost job growth by expanding apprenticeship, skills training and certification, to take advantage of Texan manufacturing power and expand the industry to employ non-college educated citizens, extending economic growth to the rural stretches of the state. He has pledged to reform the Affordable Care Act and fight for fair and reliable drug costs, lessening the burden on state-supported emergency services and ensuring adequate health care and equitable access for all socioeconomic levels. He’ll fight to protect Medicaid guarantees for vulnerable Texans like children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. More importantly, his immigration plan recognizes the role that undocumented workers play in the Texan economy and the state’s culture as a whole; and his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform is a far more reliable plan than the thinly veiled racism and ridiculous, nativist Build-the-Wall method that characterizes the Trump ‘plan.’ His education platform begins with the redirection of public tax dollars away from private schools and toward the public education system that supports nearly 5.5 million Texan kids.
My calculus is simple: Beto for Texas; Ted Cruz for himself. Of course, Beto’s race isn’t just about unseating Cruz; but we’d be remiss to ignore it. Texas and its people deserve real representation and leadership. A maverick in the Senate, a pariah even in the eyes of his own party, Cruz has time and time again doubled-down on his commitment to carving his own legacy in the annals of history, rather than giving voice to the millions of Texas who don’t have bumper stickers and web sites. With an illustrious career of landing on the wrong side of history, Cruz’s hard-liner quasi-Evangelical libertarianism more often results in honorific displays of ideology than practical legislation for Texans. It’s not hard to feel that Ted Cruz is the senator from Texas primarily because he doesn’t have another home state to choose from, and his string of failed presidential campaigns clearly demonstrate his desire to use the office as a stepping stone. Not a bad thing on its own — but blatantly self-serving with a track record as empty as Cruz’s. Many a time he’s slung himself into the national spotlight; but after nearly six years of filibusters and fanaticism, for everyone back home — what’s really changed?
By some supporters O’Rourke is described with the brightness and potential of a modern John F. Kennedy, and perhaps five or 10 years down the road we’ll see if that rings true. But right now, in this cycle, in your single voting booth in this present election, one thing is absolutely for certain: Texas made Beto O’Rourke; with our support, he’ll make good on that investment. I know it.

With signs up and down Trousdale Parkway and the flurry of new profile pictures bearing the names of candidates, the Undergraduate Student Government elections are officially underway. This past week, students witnessed the first debate between the presidential tickets — Debbie Lee & Blake Ackerman, and Mai Mizuno & Brianna Bozek — and will be able to watch them discuss more of their platform points and policy ideas next week in the diversity roundtable event. However, the 15 candidates vying for the 12 spots on the USG Senate will not be featured in debates or roundtables, with only a meet and greet event scheduled for this Monday. It’s valuable and necessary to hear candidates discuss their policy ideas in a debate or roundtable format, which the senate races will lack.

Presidential tickets are given the opportunity to publicly engage with students’ questions and flesh out their policy platforms on a campus-wide stage, but USG senatorial candidates never receive this opportunity. Meet and greet events may be important, but the reality is that students must be physically present to hear the candidates’ ideas and visions. While the presidential debates are broadcasted and released online for all students to review at their convenience, senate candidates are limited to physically engaging with students or reaching them through social media campaigns. 
Senatorial debates are especially necessary because senators play a specifically policy-heavy role in USG operations. Whereas the president and vice president oscillate between proposing policy changes and acting as  liaisons between the student body and the administration, the senate’s principal job is to create and endorse policy resolutions in response to the needs demonstrated by the student body. Their roles as senators depend upon their policy ideas and abilities to assess students’ needs, and yet they are never provided with opportunities to discuss their policy ideas and directly answer questions from the student body in a public forum. 
Additionally, debates and roundtables are not just important platforms for sharing policy ideas; they also help viewers see how candidates’ policies stand up to interrogation and opposition from opponents. Debates provide an opportunity for students to personally interact with candidates, and for candidates to challenge each other. Being a senator is centered around articulating one’s vision in a way that appeals and persuades to a majority. That students would be able to accurately gauge candidates’ abilities to serve as senators without seeing them in a debate or roundtable is dubious. In an election cycle in which none of the current 12 senators are running for re-election — and all 15 candidates, if elected, would be first-time senators — it becomes even more difficult to make an educated decision as a voter. 
Senators are expected to act as activists on behalf of students. But how can students feel confident in their choice of advocates if they have never seen the candidates operate in roles similar to the senate environment? With presidential tickets, student voters are given the opportunity to thoroughly acquaint themselves with the nominees. At the end of the election process, voters will have seen presidential candidates debate, heard their ideas for the future and watched them answer student questions. Without this process available to senatorial candidates, the senate race can easily be reduced to a popularity contest. The USG elections system should be based on more than name recognition and how appealing students find the senatorial candidates’ logos. Candidates deserve the opportunity to participate in a race based on substance and ideas, and voters deserve to cast ballots for candidates whom they were drawn to because of their ideas, and not just their posters. 
With voter turnout percentage at USC hovering from the low-to-mid-20s in recent years, it’s time for the USG elections board to direct their focus toward engaging voters — not just through free food offered at polling stations, but through facilitating dialogue between the senatorial candidates and student voters. If students have a better grasp on the policies that senatorial candidates wish to implement, they will be more likely to go to the polling stations and vote. Presidential tickets may be vying to be the face of USG, but the senate is the backbone — and it’s time students were given the opportunity to hear its voice.
