Before she was an adjunct assistant professor at the School of Social Work, Laura Owen served as a military mental health officer in San Antonio, Texas. 
Up until 9/11, Owen’s day-to-day life serving in the military was relatively similar to her previous job as a civilian social worker. That all changed the morning members of al-Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center. 
“When the events at the Twin Towers happened … I was working in [Wilford Hall Medical Facility],” said Owen in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There was a TV on with the news in the background. I remember seeing the towers go down … and I thought, ‘Oh, this is some Hollywood movie.’”
Because Owen was at work when she learned the news of the attack, she says wasn’t able to mourn the casualties like a normal citizen. 
“Being in a military environment, when your country is attacked, is otherworldly,” Owen said. “I felt the sting of the attack as an American, as a world citizen, but the response required of me was different because I was a military officer.”
After watching the footage of the mass casualties, Owen left the room to cry in private because, she said, at the time, the military “highly discouraged” officers from showing “excessive emotion” while in uniform. To her surprise, after she composed herself, she walked back out to find the other officers crying in public. 
“That was my first tip off that [it] was not going to be a regular day,” she said.
Meanwhile, in Soho, professor Keith Mayerson was getting ready to teach his freshman drawing class at New York University when he heard the first plane fly overhead. According to Mayerson, by the time he and his husband went out onto the street, there was a big hole in the World Trade Center, and, from where they were standing, they could make out the people inside of the towers. 
“It was the second week of NYU. I had to go to my freshman drawing class. I told the kids, ‘Look, you know, I don’t know what else to do. Art isn’t necessarily therapy, but maybe we should just go out and draw this thing,” said Mayerson, who currently serves as chair of  2D Art at the Roski School of Art and Design. “We went to Washington Square Park, and they brought up their sketchbooks, and, just at that moment, the first tower fell. The adults in the park were screaming and crying. My kids were terrific — they were embracing the adults and telling them it would be okay, and I said, ‘OK, class obviously is canceled, please go home and call your parents and tell them you’re OK.’ But that’s what happened that fateful day, and none of us would ever forget it.”
Hours away in San Antonio, Owen awaited clearance from the Transportation Security Administration to fly to New York to act as a mental health first responder for “female rescue and recovery workers who were first tasked with finding anybody who was still alive in the wreckage.” 
“My job was to make sure that the rescue and recovery workers who were tasked with sorting through the rubble were able to, at the end of the day, release all of the stress and then go back the next day to do the same thing,” Owen said. 
During the two weeks she spent serving in New York, Owen said she also worked with canine handlers and their dogs to help them navigate the transition from rescuing live people to recovering dead bodies.
Within weeks of returning to Texas, Owen became one of the first officers deployed to a mobile medical unit in Oman. 
“Having joined during peacetime, as a social worker, as an officer, it never occurred to me that I would actually ever go to war — that I would ever see violence or aggression,” Owen said. “I joined at a time when America was considered the only superpower and alone in its strength as the world’s preeminent military power. It never occurred to me that anyone would dare attack our country.” 
Although Owen never expected to find herself at war overseas, she said she’s proud of the work she did during her deployment. 
“Most of the people I deployed with were hurt and angry that our country had been attacked,” Owen said. “I wasn’t there just to make sure that people’s feelings were OK. I was making sure that people were able to do their jobs in an ethical way … I was there to make sure that, when we go after the bad guy, we’re only going after the bad guy — not going after civilians. That is certainly not always the case, but it was my job to make sure that angry people didn’t carry guns, that angry people didn’t fly planes, that people were psychologically sound to do their jobs.”
For Mayerson, it would take many years to fully confront the tragedies he’d witnessed the morning of the attack. 
After 9/11, Mayerson depicted the events through allegories to “talk about reality but from a distance.” Some of the paintings throughout these years featured fictional characters like Spider Man, King Kong and Jimmy Stewart at the World Trade Center. However, after nearly a decade, Mayerson still had nightmares of people falling from the towers. 
Following his father’s advice, Mayerson started making paintings of the actual events almost seven years later. 
“It was really hard painting. I would break down in tears … but, when I was finished, I felt really edified. It was very cathartic,” he explained. “So, ‘edifying’ is a good word for me because I wasn’t happy, but it made a difference in my life.”
Although she grew up hearing stories like those of Mayerson and Owen, Chantal Corona wasn’t alive before 9/11. 
“[9/11’s] significance to me? I don’t think there is much, just because, I mean, I wasn’t born yet. I didn’t really understand what was going on at the time,” said Corona, a freshman studying health and the human sciences. 
Hayden Rivas, a sophomore majoring in dance, expressed a similar sentiment. 
“You know, I grew up in Canada, so the implications were kind of different … I’m glad to acknowledge it within the states, but it’s just something that I don’t actively think about all the time.” 
To Owen, meeting and teaching students who are too young to remember the attack is bittersweet.
“It’s heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time to teach students who didn’t know a world before 9/11,” Owen said. “So much of what my generation went through, fought for, defended and also got wrong is the precursor to what my younger students experience.”
Owen believes that, because of 9/11, the new generation of students grew up to be more skeptical of people in power and more motivated to be politically involved.
“I see, every day in my classroom, the evolution of ideals. My students are smarter and better than I was at their age. They’re asking harder questions than I asked; they’re including more people than I thought to include; they’re challenging the status quo in a way that I don’t think I knew to challenge [it]. I think all of that happens, because they’re building on as far as my generation could go,” she added. “That makes me feel tremendously hopeful.”

Corah Forrester, a senior majoring in business administration, noticed that the portion of female students present in her Marshall School of Business classes was much smaller than that of male students. 
“There’s been classes where I’ve definitely felt like I’m one of the few women in the class,” Forrester said. “It’s a little bit harder to assert myself in those classes and make sure I’m getting involved because the men in the group sometimes can be overbearing.” 
However, Forrester is “hopeful” this will soon change following Marshall’s announcement of the first-year Class of 2025 reaching gender parity earlier this month.
According to a Sept. 3 news release, women comprise 52% of Marshall’s current first-year student population as of the first day of classes, an increase of three percentage points from 49% in the Class of 2024. 
“Achieving this milestone has significant impact on the incoming class, the Marshall students across programs and our alumni,” said Interim Vice Dean of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Violina Rindova in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “For the incoming class, this could have a transformative impact on the classroom experience and learning, as research shows that both men and women behave differently in settings where women representation has critical mass. For all Marshall students, this sends a strong signal of the commitment of Marshall’s leadership to diversity and the effectiveness of our processes in increasing it.” 
Following the release of acceptance letters last spring, Marshall implemented strategic marketing of various programs, such as the Global Leadership Program and the Experiential Learning Center. The school also promoted women faculty and new scholarships aimed toward women students, according to the Sept. 3 news release. Additionally, Rindova hosted a virtual leadership forum that featured a panel of four female alumni and included more than 110 students — both men and women. 
“We created a panel of alumnae women leaders because we believe that the Trojan Family is a tremendous asset for both students and alumni,” Rindova said in the statement. “Gender parity in our incoming class means more opportunities for all our alumni to be a part of mentoring and supporting the growth of diversity in the leadership cadre Marshall prepares for the future.” 
Forrester, who serves as the internal president of the Marshall Women’s Leadership Board, said the achievement “aligns so well” with their goal, which aims to “create a safe space for women in business” through professional development workshops, such as resume and cover letter workshops, and a mentorship program with individuals from professional industries. 
“As an organization [whose] goal is to empower women in business, being able to see that there are more of us in the school … and that we’re reaching a level of equality and parity, in that sense, is really exciting and really makes me hopeful for the future,” Forrester said. 
Shreya Chaudhary, a senior majoring in business administration and director of recruitment for the Marshall Women’s Leadership Board, said the achievement is “absolutely amazing” and “long overdue.” 
“I think that this is just one milestone in many to come, in terms of where we’re going to be going in the future, and how Marshall is going to be a leader within so many industries in the field of business, and especially a place where, hopefully, women will be proud to say that they’re an alumnae from,” Chaudhary said. 
Chaudhary said she hopes Marshall will continue to work toward changing the reputation the school’s students and environment have on campus. 
“There’s definitely this reputation in which we’re almost known for being toxically cutthroat,” Chaudhary said. “If Marshall can do a little bit better with easing that reputation and making it feel like a more welcoming community that doesn’t feel like that, I think that we would go a long ways in making women feel more comfortable within the environment.” 
Following this achievement, Forrester said Marshall’s next step should ensure women can thrive in the school’s environment. 
“The next step is to make sure that they are creating more safe spaces for women within the [school] so they feel comfortable and supported,” Forrester said. “Whether that means offering more specific programs within the school — not just necessarily student organizations — but specific programs within the curriculum that are more geared towards empowering the women in the school, or looking at the way the Marshall culture works, and trying to identify how we can make this a culture that supports our students and the women in this school.”

After a 42-28 defeat to Stanford Saturday night, USC athletic director Mike Bohn relieved former head coach Clay Helton of his duties after six seasons and named associate head coach Donte Williams as interim. 
In his first practice as head coach, Williams echoed the positive energy from Monday night during his “Trojans Live” appearance. 
“To be honest it felt great. I am thankful for the opportunity. Dr. [Carol] Folt, Mike and [associate athletic director] Brandon [Sosna] gave me the opportunity,” said Williams during practice Tuesday. “These players are out here competing, going hard. Everyone has embraced the opportunity that has been set before us, and our biggest thing is about going 1 and 0 today.” 
Williams emphasized treating every game with the same importance and focusing on one week at a time. 
“Really, we’re focused on right now. What happened yesterday, happened yesterday; it’s about right now, you can’t change the past,” Williams said. “Right now, you got a chance to see how these guys came out here, flew around and competed. The energy was high and I’m thankful for these guys.” 
After nine penalties were called against USC during the  Stanford game, Williams is focusing on the details while preparing for Washington State. The interim head coach highlighted how the staff is taking an extra look at players during practice, making sure they’re playing a clean game. 
“Just making sure we touch on every little thing. We pay attention to all the little details,” Williams said. “That’s what we’re focused on right now as coaches … A guy makes the littlest mistake, the coaches get on them, whether that’s taking them out for a play, whether that’s taking them out for a quarter.”
With Williams at the helm and 10 games remaining, the Trojans still have time to turn around their season. Bohn also spoke to the media, echoing praise for Williams and relaying expectations for the season. 
“We still have very, very high expectations for this team, as they do as well, so we are going to do everything we can to help them be successful in the next ten games and hopefully a big bowl game at the end of this season as well,” Bohn said. “Whatever opportunity that is, we still control our destiny, and I think that the players and this coaching staff understands that as well.”
As USC begins preparation for its first road trip of the season, players are more focused on the upcoming game, rather than the Stanford loss. Redshirt senior safety and team captain Isaiah Pola-Mao smiled when asked about last week’s loss, saying “that was a long time ago.”
This Saturday, USC (1-1) will travel to Pullman, Wash. to face Washington State (1-1).

It feels like classes started just yesterday. But it’s midway through September which means football season is now well underway. 
Now, I won’t say that I understand the game better than some of my fellow sports columnists. I did only learn the rules of the game two years ago when I moved to the United States.
But I’d be lying if I said I don’t love watching football. The fan energy that comes with following USC football is somewhat transferable to the world of esports. Even if you are not aware of the intricacies involved in playing League of Legends, you’d still find yourself overflowing with energy if you stepped into a stadium. 
However, not all areas of professional gaming are equally competitive. By that, I refer to the “streaming wars.” 
Let me explain. While this term has been used often to refer to the competition between all the different television and movie viewing platforms (e.g. Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, etc.…), it has also been used to address the competition between livestreaming companies. While I may have focused solely on Twitch in past columns, there are a lot of other websites offering similar content out there — many whichbelong to tech giants. 
Naturally, when companies such as  YouTube and Facebook enter the same market, there will be a “war” for the biggest share, at least on paper.
The reality is no other company comes close to Twitch’s numbers, both in total hours watched and total hours spent streaming. While other services have a monopoly on a specific niche audience (with YouTube gaming being particularly popular among those who watch virtual YouTubers), that “monopoly” rarely constitutes a threat to Twitch’s authority. 
But why should we care?
Well, while all this business talk seems very disconnected from what is actually happening on the platform, the truth is that Twitch’s monopoly harms its content creators.
A recent Washington Post article investigated why some streamers are still leaving the platform. What they found was that since Twitch has “won” the streaming wars, the website has now changed its approach toward exclusivity contracts. The general trend of those modifications seems to be to offer less money than they used to or even stop offering contracts at all. 
That is because streamers now have less leverage to negotiate better terms. Moving to a different service means losing a great deal of your audience in the process. Unless you are a household name and can score a lifelong deal with a competitor, odds are you will want to remain on Twitch. 
This is particularly salient for esports athletes that stream on Twitch. Since most of them are professionals at video games that generate little revenue and target a more niche audience, Twitch is the only place where they can still make money off of their skills (although professionals that play popular games are usually doing fine financially with just their esports contracts). As the platform itself is shifting away into a more casual audience, many people that used to headline tournaments now barely manage to amass a following. 
This leads to esports athletes being stuck between a rock and a hard place as they are forced to either take Twitch’s low offer or risk having to work a 9 to 5 that has nothing to do with the games they fell in love with. 
Not only does this monopoly harm content creators, but it also specifically makes life a lot harder for the very people that made Twitch an interesting platform in the first place. That is why we should care.
If you look at the numbers, you will see that livestreaming exploded in popularity during the pandemic. Many new creators joined the market, offering fresh perspectives and entertainment during a time where many sought some comfort. 
The explosion also helped legitimize livestreaming as a viable professional outlet, with many companies now interested in either supporting or specializing in that form of entertainment. The recent surge in audience and overall investments in esports competitions led to an increase in tournament frequencies. As said in previous columns, many big streamers hosted their own professional events during the pandemic. This not only led to an increase in popularity for the games being showcased but also gave struggling pros an opportunity to demonstrate their hard-earned skills .
If  Twitch continues to offer new creators enough money to survive, it seems apparent everything we have gained in this previous year will simply disappear, and the platform will stagnate once more. While this would help shift the tides and give strength to competitors (eventually solving the monopoly issue), it would still be detrimental to the creators who abandoned the prospect of a career throughout the process. 
And if the driving force behind what made livestreaming so fun during the past year — the myriad of new creators and giving more niche esports pros a place — was to leave, would there even be a reason to keep watching?

After parting ways with former head coach Clay Helton, USC athletic director Mike Bohn appointed associate head coach Donte Williams as interim head coach. Minutes before it was released to the public, the announcement was made to the team and Williams.
“To be honest, I found out right before the team meeting,” said Williams on USC’s “Trojans Live” radio show Monday. “It was just a normal day for me. I was just making sure my guys were ready to play, and next thing you know, right before the team meeting, Mike [Bohn] and [assistant athletic director] Brandon [Sosna] pulled me in and talked to me.”
Williams was hired by USC in February 2020 to be the cornerbacks coach and one of their premier recruiters. He previously served as the Oregoncornerbacks coach, where he spent two years developing his reputation as one of the most elite recruiters in the nation. Williams’ efforts as a recruiter helped the Ducks steal high school recruits right out of USC’s backyard, including formerfive-star linebacker Justin Flowe.  
In December 2020, Williams was promoted to associate head coach after helping the USC recruiting class finish 57 spots higher than it did the previous year. Now, Williams believes his recruiting history with these players provides an advantage in forming relationships with them as their new head coach.
“I’m a person that’s very fortunate because a lot of these guys either I’ve recruited here, or I’ve recruited at past places. I believe I have a great relationship with the guys on our team, I have a great relationship with the staff we have in place here,” he said. “A lot of these guys’ families I even know pretty well, so I think the change that is happening right now is a lot easier for me than it would be for someone else.”
Bohn had nothing but good things to say about his new interim head coach.
“You’re really gonna enjoy Donte Williams,” said Bohn Monday during “Trojan’s Live.” “Donte is a gentleman, and, the good news, is he’s got some really talented coaches in that room with him. He has a unique ability just to connect with young people. I am really looking forward to seeing what he can do.”
Williams also has a clear cut vision for how he wants his team to approach the future. 
“Right now, the season’s just started. My biggest thing is about enhancing everything we do,” he said. “How can we enhance everything we do — whether it’s the way we lift weights, the way we eat, the way we practice, the way we play — just enhancing everything we do. That’s the biggest message right now.”
Williams offered his insight on USC’s blowout 42-28 loss to Stanford last Saturday.
“Too many little things become huge and big things, and they cost us. They cost us penalties, they cost us dumb mistakes, they cost us as a team, they cost us as a, University,” he said. “Everyone in this organization needs to do something a little bit better than what they were doing before, including myself.”
The family connection is what makes Williams comfortable with leading the team after a loss with a lot of backfire. Although the loss to Stanford Saturday led to outpour on social media from fans and alumni for the firing of Helton, Williams had high praise for the fans and hopes they can remain supportive throughout the rest of the season.
“The atmosphere of this past game was electric,” he said. “It’s based on us and the product we put on the field to make sure that environment stays that way and gets even better. I’m about making sure the Coliseum is sold out. What we need to do is make sure we put the best product on the field to make sure that happens.”
Williams’ first test as a head coach will come this Saturday on the road against Washington State at 12:30 p.m.

From coffee shops to handmade tacos and millennial lotería, Los Angeles has an abundance of Latinx businesses that not only curate a love and appreciation for Latinx culture but also provide a piece of home for many here in the United States. 
There’s no better way to kick off Latinx Heritage Month than with a list full of Latinx owned businesses to hit up for good food and even better pastries around the USC community. Although it seems nearly impossible not to bump into a local business around South Central, if you’re one of those who don’t stray far from campus, the Daily Trojan has you covered.
La Taquiza Mexican Grill 
Located right outside of campus, La Taquiza is a taco shop known for its handmade corn tortillas and authentic horchata — ranging from the original cinnamon flavor to a strawberry variety and even horchata lattes — to many other kinds of aguas frescas. Established 16 years ago, the shop remains one of my favorite spots to hit up for tacos. 
And, don’t think we’ve forgotten about the vegans and vegetarians out there — La Taquiza has a multitude of non-meat options such as quinoa burritos and fajitas for you.
 Tropicana Bakery and Cuban Cafe
If you venture a bit east to Downey, you can find a beautiful dine-in bakery inspired by Cuban and Mexican culture. Established over two decades ago, the     Cuban-Mexican Madrazo family opened “Los Pollos” where the food includes a bit of both cultures and has since experienced great success to the point where they added another location of “Los Pollos” in East L.A. and opened Tropicana Bakery in Downey. 
Tropicana, also owned by the Madrazo family, opened after in 2006. This shop specializes in authentic Cuban fare like Pastelitos de Guayaba, Mango, Carne and Empanadas along with authentic Cuban coffee and cakes.
Capuyo Café
If you can’t make it all the way to Downey, there are many more Latinx sweet shops close by like Capuyo Café in Downtown L.A.
Latina owner Daisy Iñiguez makes a range of traditional Latinx drinks and coffee mixes using her Mexican and Guatemalan light coffee bean roasts. Other drinks include organic aguas frescas like jamaica water, vegan horchata and strawberry rose lemonade. 
If you’re looking to try a unique take on Latinx drinks that remains authentic, Capuyo is a must. 
Poncho’s Tlayuda’s
In Oaxacalifornia, some promote resistance to colonialism and the status quo through the practice of making Indigenous food and keeping Indigenous culture alive. Poncho’s is a traditional Indigenous eatery that specializes in Tlayudas, a Oaxacan cuisine that consists of fried tortillas beans, meat, Oaxacan cheese and much more.
Hector the Barber
Now that you have enough restaurants to feed you for a lifetime, let’s move on to other Latinx business ventures. If you’re in need of a fresh haircut, this is the place for you. In South L.A., not too far from USC, you can find Hector’s barber shop which hosts Trojan customers every week. 
Shop Latinx
Maybe you can’t make it out into the streets of L.A. — don’t fret!  In the era of social media, there are tons of small online shops or outlets owned by Latinx community members that you can support virtually. Created in 2016 by Brittany Chavez, shoplatinx.com was made to be a hub for Latinx creators to sell their work to others with the intention of amplifying and centering Latinx entrepreneurship and empowerment. 
Millennial Lotería 
By now, everyone has surely heard of lotería, a Mexican game similar to bingo, but creator Mike Alfaro saw a chance to recreate this classic game with a millennial take. With cards now including “la karen” and “el sugar papi,” Millennial Lotería can be found on Instagram, TikTok and is now even sold at Target. Celebrating Latinx Heritage Month is also partaking in traditions and games like lotería while also taking time to reflect how time has drastically changed the community and culture, millennial lotería does just that.
These are just a few of the many Latinx owned businesses that can be found online and around USC in L.A. With just a Google search or a five minute walk outside of campus, you can find these and many more places to support this month and every month of the year because come on, what’s better than some pan dulce after a long day on campus?

Excitement was tangible in the Zoom webinar as L.A. Skins Fest: Native American Women in Media panelists logged on for a night full of conversation about representation and inclusion. The event brought attendees across the United States Monday night to learn more about the experiences of Native American women in the film and television industry. 
The collaborative effort between the School of Cinematic Arts, Visions and Voices and L.A. Skins Fest — the latter described as “a film festival that provides opportunities for Native American filmmakers and offers additional programming to encourage them” — featured an impressive array of panelists ranging from filmmakers to actors. Alyssa London, founder and CEO of Culture Story, a company that creates media content that embraces the vitality of Native and Indigenous cultures, moderated the event and introduced the speakers. 
Tazbah Rose Chavez, a writer, producer and episodic director for the hit TV series “Reservation Dogs,” Princess Daazhraii Johnson, creative producer of the Peabody Award-winning PBS KIDS series “Molly of Denali,” Kelly Lynne D’Angelo, a writer for “Miracle Workers,” “Spirit Rangers’’ and “Final Space,” and Cara Jade Myers, a writer and actor recently cast in one of Martin Scorsese’s next films, “Killers of the Flower Moon,” were the esteemed panelists for the event. 
The importance of community was tangible from the beginning as attendees witnessed the camaraderie and friendship among the panelists. They bantered back and forth. sharing connections, stories and anecdotes that tied them together by more than just their shared cultural background and heritage. 
One of the highlighted topics throughout the night was the idea of “narrative sovereignty.” Johnson introduced the idea at the beginning of the panel and spoke to the importance of  Native people telling Native stories.
“I just think that, so often we have people from outside of our community coming in to tell our stories, and we need to build the [Native American presence in the industry] because having that narrative sovereignty and having our indigenous lens is so critical,” Johnson said. 
Johnson’s fellow panelists agreed. Myers shared her own experiences on sets lacking Native American talent while trying to tell Native American stories where they would push inaccurate stereotypes. Myers also ascribed a different level of ease to telling stories about the Native American experience with a Native American team. 
“I love working with other Natives because there is a certain trust that what they’re writing, or what they’re doing or what they’re saying is authentic versus someone just being like ‘Oh and now she wears a headdress because it’s a ceremony,’ and you’re like ‘no, I don’t,’” Myers said.
Myers also described her experiences on the set of “Killers of the Flower Moon” and expressed her relief at the openness white department heads demonstrated when she told them a cultural practice wasn’t depicted correctly in the film. But, when you are responsible for answering for an entire diverse community, it can be difficult, Myers said. She described the challenges of being the only Native talent on set, where you’re given a whole other job in addition to the one you have in the project. 
“I find a lot of times when you’re one of the few Natives, then you’re constantly having to be the advocate, the teacher and you have to be the consultant, so you’re constantly wearing multiple hats,” Myers said. “If they have a Native American question they come to you.”
D’Angelo also spoke to the ease of working with an Indigenous team. She explained how, when working with people from your own community as collaborators, there is a kind of “veil” that is lifted. Being surrounded by fellow Native Americans allowed her to feel as though she can simply be. There’s a whole conversation that doesn’t need to be had by virtue of their shared heritage and experiences that non-Native creators are unable to relate to, D’Angelo said. 
“It just makes it easy,” D’Angelo said. “It’s like pedaling down the chillest stream in the world instead of going through one during a turbulent storm.”
The importance of representation was emphasized by all panelists. Chavez, in particular, shared how essential representation is for her when it comes to incorporating the Native American experience in all narratives, whether being Native is central to the plot or not. 
“[Representation] absolutely is the guiding light and North Star of my career path. I am most interested in telling indigenous female stories and inserting those perspectives into any show I’m a part of whether it’s Native or  non-Native, and that’s something [I never] shy away from discussing,” Chavez said. “I don’t see myself tiring of that because there’s such diversity in our stories across our nations that I don’t think centering the indigenous female narrative is going to grow old.”
Even with the progress made for Native American filmmakers and actors recently, London said the film and television industry is still full of rejection. But, for Myers, it was her stubbornness and determination that saw her through those difficult times. 
“I just made the decision that I’m going to be in the entertainment industry no matter what because I love storytelling,” Myers said. “And, of course, Native Americans are so underrepresented that it seems so important to me to keep going because, if I give up, then it’s like that’s just one less person that could be on TV that I never saw growing up.”
D’Angelo closed out the event with a discussion on the importance of intersectionality when representing the Native American community.
“We all exist, we are dynamic,” D’Angelo said. “There are things that we need to start telling stories about, but we are just starting and that’s what’s so exciting and thrilling. But we’re getting there, one step at a time, one conversation at a time, one show at a time, one story at a time.”

With the rise of coronavirus came the rise of Zoom. Well, Zoom has actually been around since 2011, but the emergence of the pandemic warranted a way to continue interacting with others in a virtual format for school, work, appointments and more.
In the past year and a half, Zoom has become accessible to students of all ages, from elementary school to college. Furthermore, students have gone from a wondrous fascination with Zoom to utter hatred. After spending hours a day attending classes through a computer, it’s no wonder many users suffer from “Zoom fatigue.”
With that being said, many students and adults are more than eager to get rid of Zoom and fully return to normal pre-pandemic life, but some experts believe that the pandemic may not come to a clear end any time soon. Considering how rapidly the virus can evolve, variants make the situation even messier. Consequently, Zoom might not be out of our lives as soon as some may wish. 
However, it is important to consider the benefits Zoom has added to daily life. As much as people want to get back to normalcy, should we should do away with Zoom altogether? 
There are certainly pros and cons to remote learning and work. Some find it easier to do things remotely, as it allows one to work from the comfort of their own home or wherever else they might choose. Of course, many would argue that a whole year of remote working and learning has been detrimental. 
For example, students, both young and old, may feel anxious to fully return to in-person learning because they have become comfortable with virtual interaction. A whole year of Zoom school worsened some people’s social anxiety and stamina. Students returning to campus are still adjusting to the hustle and bustle of what we used to know as daily life. Getting dressed in (real) clothes, walking to classes all day long and even getting back into the habit of seemingly trivial things such as small talk with classmates before professors begin lecture. 
Taking all that into consideration, it makes sense that many people would like to see Zoom gone from their lives forever. However, as sick of it as students are, Zoom has benefits that we shouldn’t be so quick to ditch. 
For one, it allows ill students to stay home and rest while still “attending” class. For most college students, this has never been an option before. When a student was sick before the pandemic, they would be forced to choose between completely missing lectures or attending class and risk spreading illness to peers and professors. 
Returning fully to in-person classes is clearly what everyone wants and even needs, but perhaps universities should keep a virtual learning option for students with illnesses, or at least continue the practice of recording lectures. Not only are recorded lectures great for absent students, but they can also be very beneficial as a study resource for students to rewatch lectures and review lecture material. 
In addition, Zoom webinars are great for large-scale information sessions or campus engagement activities. Universities may not always have the space available to hold larger events or even the time to set up a space and make all necessary preparations, such as sanitizing measures. 
However, it is important that both students and professors don’t abuse the virtual option because online learning should not become a permanent substitution for the in-person learning experience. The continuation of a virtual learning option should not be used for individuals who would like to take a vacation or just attend class somewhere else rather than being physically present. Similarly, many professors continue to repeatedly show pre-recorded, old lectures to their students.
When it is possible again, school must return to its former glory of full in-person student and professor interaction. Zoom has made life easier in some ways yet difficult in many other ways. However, a careful balance of remote learning in our return to pre-pandemic life may be more helpful than we would like to admit.

Odds are you probably caught a glimpse of the apocalyptic-looking oil spill in the Yucatán Peninsula over the summer, which was caused by an underwater oil pipeline bursting and natural gas bubbling to the surface. Consequently, electric shocks from a storm sparked the ocean’s surface into flames. 
If this hellish event wasn’t on your radar, perhaps you caught the disaster last year in Mauritius, where a Japanese shipping vessel ran into a fragile coral reef and seeped nearly 1,000 tons of heavy oil into the Indian Ocean. Maybe you’ve read about the oil pipeline off the coast of Louisiana that ruptured due to Hurricane Ida, or the largest marine oil spill to date at the Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010, which seeped more than 300 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
Suffice to say, oil spills happen all the time. Thousands of spills occur each year around the world, some of which spill as little as a single barrel of oil but nonetheless cause environmental degradation and economic losses. 
In my environmental studies classes, I hear the words “precautionary principle” thrown around a lot. Basically, this concept argues that action should be taken to prevent irreversible damage to the environment. While it admittedly sounds like wishful thinking, we’ve been given enough evidence as to what happens when we face a marine oil mishap. It’s time to stop retroactive regret and start prioritizing safety and environmental wellbeing over the potential profit of a dwindling resource. 
Stopping things before they happen is a fairly logical argument, but let me take this one step further. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels altogether — the less deep sea oil drilling we commit, the smaller the chance for a huge environmental disaster. 
For a bit of background, petroleum companies set up huge sea platforms and drill deep into the seafloor to extract pockets of crude oil and natural gas. The collected fossil fuels are ultimately refined into a state which can be used to meet the world’s energy needs. 
Oil spills can occur at any point along the petroleum extraction and refinement process. Oil slicks are at the mercy of the weather and currents, and they can be broken apart or spread far from their source. As the sheen breaks apart, some of the oil breaks down and deposits on the seafloor while microbes break down the rest. 
As a result, spilt petroleum pollutes water with toxins and metals, lowers oxygen levels, blocks sunlight and drastically degrades water quality as a whole. While the damage can vary, oil spills contribute to toxic marine and air pollution — marine life can become asphyxiated, coral reefs can become stressed and commercially important species can become too contaminated for consumption. 
Oil can contaminate drinking water supplies and threaten local fishermen’s livelihoods when the water is too oily for revenue-generating activities. This could potentially decimate the economies of tropical getaways such as Mauritius, when their main tourist attractions become inundated with a sheen of iridescent oil. Additionally, human health risks associated with oil spills may include respiratory damage, decreased immunity and increased risks of cancer. 
11 years after Deepwater Horizon and $10 billion later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal and Gulf state partners are still actively working to restore the area by supporting local species and strengthening marshes, beaches and other critical habitats. While chemical dispersants siphon away much of the visible petroleum, cleaning efforts can have detrimental effects too. Chemicals can enter food chains, and methods such as floating booms, microbes and inorganic sorbents simply do not guarantee the eradication of every last drop of oil. 
Burning the oil layer on top of the water is a more controversial method of oil removal, since this causes more air pollution and fails to address sinking oil. Cleaning strategies can also be exacerbated by local environmental conditions such as temperature, currents and weather. 
The domestic and international economic impacts on marine markets and the long-term health consequences aren’t going away anytime soon — we need to quit while we’re ahead and stop retroactively learning about the numerous repercussions of oil spills.
Marinas and bays have implemented rules for boaters to prevent individual oil spills and leaks, including routine oil storage tank inspections and proper disposal and recycling of used oil and filters. Post-Deepwater Horizon, a Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement was created to oversee and enforce offshore drilling safety and establish better protocols to be more prepared to address future spills. 
However, installing more secure drilling technology or calculating a shipping route far from sensitive marine areas are just performative band-aids on a much bigger problem. The ocean is an interconnected ecosystem, and regardless of where energy companies sail or what kind of machinery they use, marine organisms will still be at risk. To circle back to my initial argument, the core of the issue lies within big petroleum-drilling corporations, not individual fossil fuel users. 
But how can our society move away from the petroleum industry? The truth is, it doesn’t seem realistic or economically viable,at least in the near future. Transitioning all of society to an entirely new source of fuel — and essentially economy — requires levels of change over time. Although we’ve already moved from coal to “cleaner burning” fossil fuels such as petroleum and natural gas, we still have a long way to go. 
Many tout natural gas as the perfect “bridge fuel” — that is, a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel that will sustain us as we continue to perfect technology and move toward a greater reliance on renewables. 
However, the longer we rely on the extraction of any kind of fossil fuel, the deeper the grave we’re digging for ourselves. It’s difficult to strike a balance of moving away from fossil fuels while developing and refining renewable technologies, but the more energy and money we devote to improving renewable technologies, the more we will be able to accommodate energy needs. 
While implementation of any sort is difficult because of a lack of effective international environmental oversight, any country would do well to prioritize investment in renewable energy technology improvement. By actively moving away from fossil fuels — and acknowledging that bridge fuels are nothing but capitalist propaganda to continue reliance on nonrenewables — we’re ensuring better energy security and accessibility, prioritizing our own health and improving the health of marine ecosystems. 
With the increasing pressures of climate change — most notably, the increasing strength of hurricanes in the Gulf — we need to recognize the insubstantiality of the oil drilling industry and start making changes now.
