A food delivery became a near phone robbery for a USC student earlier this month. A Department of Public Safety alert sent Oct. 2 notified the University community that a delivery driver took a student’s phone by force during a takeout drop-off. A physical altercation began between the two where the student managed to retrieve his phone, but had been punched by the suspect several times.
As of publication, there have been 16 cell phone robberies reported to DPS since the beginning of 2022. Seven of these occurred since move-in day on Aug. 8. The number of cell phone thefts saw a 23% increase from 2021, when 13 robberies were reported, and a 45% increase from 2020, when 11 robberies were reported. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the University saw a higher rate of cell phone thefts, with 35 reported in 2019. 
DPS Sergeant Ralph Roseli wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that the number of cell phone robberies saw a decrease due to inactivity on campus during 2020 and 2021. Now that students are back on campus and have been for the greater part of 2022, robberies are rising, but have not risen to pre-2020 levels. 
“The increase is driven by the fact that we have more people present here on campus than we had in the last couple of years,” said Roseli, who also works as a training coordinator and assistant public information officer, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “As we come out of our isolation during the pandemic, people are relearning how to interact with one another.”
Roseli said certain situations, such as simply having a cell phone, especially on the sidewalks or by the street, often leave students more vulnerable to these kinds of robberies. 
“Those who perpetrate this crime are looking for what they might perceive to be easy opportunities,” Roseli said. “Even if one were paying perfect attention to all of their surroundings and had their cell phone out, they might be perceived to be distracted and thus targeted.”
Dani Mendez, a senior majoring in communications, was the victim of an attempted cell phone theft at a gym on campus. Mendez left her phone on the treadmill to save her place and left for the restroom. By the time she came back, it was gone.
“Fortunately, I had my friends who work there. They were able to trace it,” Mendez said. 
Mendez also recalled the times she has seen phones left unattended and said how this can invite potential robbers to take their devices. 
“I’ve seen so many phones left on tables, especially at [Tutor Campus Center],” Mendez said. “If you see someone leave something, give them a heads up because you don’t want that for yourself. It could happen to anybody.”
Despite the danger that exists in having a cell phone visible to potential robbers, Mendez said it’s difficult to keep devices away all the time because of the numerous functions they have for users. 
“We have schedules and we’re trying to create a future, and our schedules are on our phones,” Mendez said. “If you lose that, you are kind of discombobulated.”
Roseli said he understands that cell phones are an essential accessory for many, but said this constant use could pose a danger to oneself, especially with robberies occurring at all times of the day. 
“Especially with midterms coming, we’re all dependent on our devices. We are constantly communicating,” Roseli said. “It’s just a matter of balancing and having awareness when we’re out in public.”
Roseli said there are units patrolling both on and off campus to respond to crimes, as well as a plethora of closed circuit televisions and monitors watching 24 hours a day, and “yellow jackets” posted at key positions throughout the community. 
“The key is, we want to encourage people to trust their gut, trust their instinct,” Roseli said about people dismissing unease during uncomfortable situations or encounters. “Oftentimes, when people know or sense something’s wrong, they talk themselves out of it because they don’t want to be rude or perceived as being biased, but, typically, there’s something behavior-wise that’s there that we really want to encourage people to listen to.”
Shania Jafri, a senior majoring in neuroscience, has also had her belongings stolen on campus. She expressed sympathy for the students who have become victims of the rising number of robberies, but said she isn’t surprised at the thefts’ frequency. 
“It’s unfortunate that students are getting their phones stolen, but this is the area we live in,” Jafri said. “I’m not really fazed by it. This is how USC is, it’s in a very gentrified area.”
Jafri suggested small ways students can make themselves less vulnerable to thefts in general, including keeping valuables such as headphones and sunglasses away when out in public. 
“Be conscious and understanding of USC and L.A.,” Jafri said. “Don’t walk with your phone in your hand as you get further away from campus.”
If a person finds themself in a dangerous confrontation, Roseli emphasized that they should refrain from engaging. 
“It’s important that we recognize it’s just property that can be replaced,” Roseli said. “It’s not worth our safety and it’s not worth our well-being. As we look at our statistics, we find that our sole injuries come from when people fight back for their property.”

Los Angeles city attorney candidates Faisal Gill and Hydee Feldstein Soto participated in a virtual candidate forum Monday held by the League of Women Voters of Greater Los Angeles. Los Angeles Valley College, National Council of Jewish Women – Los Angeles and the USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future sponsored the event.  
Gabriel Romero, a fifth-year student majoring in political science and environmental studies, attended the forum. Romero said Gill is viewed as the more “progressive” and “reformist” candidate, while Feldstein Soto is “moderate” and “pragmatic.” 
“The city attorney has a significant amount of power in bringing lawsuits against companies or other organizations,” Romero said. “The city attorney is an underrated position in terms of power.” 
Gill was born in Pakistan and raised in Virginia. He later served in the Navy and was a spokesman for the American Muslim Council. His campaign’s top priorities include police reform, criminal justice reform and addressing homelessness and housing. 
Feldstein Soto was born in Puerto Rico and moved to Los Angeles nearly 40 years ago. She previously served as vice president of Interim General Counsel for Kin Community, an entertainment company that produces content for female audiences. Homelessness, protecting community values and rooting out corruption are top priorities for her campaign. 
During the event’s Q&A session, Romero asked the candidates about how they plan to protect disadvantaged communities and bring environmental justice to the community. 
In response, Feldstein Soto, who is endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, said she would focus on oil leases and the California Environmental Quality Act. 
Gill said he would address corporate polluters to ensure they are held accountable. He also said oil wells affect people of color disproportionately, and that he will keep that in mind when serving environmental justice.
Teya Hisel, who serves as the president and policy director of advocaSC, a student organization that participates in policy advocacy, education and direct service for unhoused individuals in L.A., then asked the candidates how they would enforce laws targeted towards unhoused individuals and if they think these laws worsen the housing crisis. 
“I absolutely believe [the laws] are an inhumane targeting of houseless people. I think that they are not practical,” Gill said. “We are not going to solve the homelessness problem through the criminal justice system, and I’ve been very clear about that. We need to provide people with services.”
Feldstein Soto said her focus on addressing homelessness is to lower the cost of housing and enlist buffer zones between people experiencing houselessness and schools. 
“I understand the concern of wanting to protect kids in schools from crime. I think it does come from an assumption that folks who are unhoused are going to be violent, that there is an issue with mental health and crime,” Hisel, a senior majoring in global studies and philosophy, politics and law, said. “I think whenever things like that are said, we need to challenge the assumptions that are behind that.” 
Gill and Feldstein Soto also said that the city attorney’s office has a role in preventing corruption amongst government officials when questioned about a leaked recording featuring L.A. City Council members Kevin de León, Nury Martinez and Gil Cedillo during a redistricting meeting.
“I appreciated the unity in what is happening in city council now with the leak,” Hisel said, referring to both of the candidates’ disapproval of what was said in the recording.
Specifically, Gill said the L.A. city attorney should be leading the corruption investigation. Feldstein Soto said ethics commissioners should have independently appointed terms to address corrupt government officials.
In response to a question about what actions the candidates have taken to demonstrate their ability to succeed as city attorney, Feldstein Soto said her community involvement and Gill said his previous collaboration with the city attorney’s office.
Both candidates were asked about the coronavirus eviction moratorium, as city council voted to phase out the protection . Gill said he would enforce protection against tenant harassment. Feldstein Soto said she would empower tenants to bring claims and provide them with habitable apartments. 
The event ended with closing statements from both candidates on the reasons behind their campaigns. 
“I hope everybody has heard why I want to run [for city attorney], and it is for criminal justice reform,” Gill said. “It is to hold the city accountable, not just the police department, but other departments to make sure we root out corruption. It is to make sure that we come up with real solutions to the homelessness issue and not to use the criminal justice system as a sword against homelessness.” 
Feldstein Soto’s closing statement focused on her vision for the community.
“I want to make sure that we protect the diversity. I want to make sure that we give all of our residents a voice, and I want to make sure that we make the city work for all of us,” Feldstein Soto said. “That sometimes requires details, not just vision and values about unspecified ways of holding people accountable. It requires the commitment to get down into the nitty gritty and to come up with a plan.”
Hisel said it is important for voters to participate in smaller elections.
“[Races like this] seem small, but they are not. They are really, really important for the day to day of how the city operates,” Hisel said. “If you are a registered L.A. voter, vote in the local small elections.”

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault and violence. 
A grassroots, student-led organization called A Path 2 Courage has partnered with USC Hillel and Breaking Silence Co. to create an interactive exhibit featuring three stories of sexual assault. Beginning Thursday, visitors to the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s Franklin Suites #350 will walk through the recreated settings of where the abuse took place and listen to stories from survivors.
Sophie Pollack, the founder of A Path 2 Courage, is a junior majoring in sociology. In April 2020, she founded the organization to take her own experience with sexual assault and domestic violence and create a space of healing and open dialogue, specifically within Greek life. 
“Being a survivor myself, I really tried to think of what could other people benefit from hearing what I’ve gone through or what I’ve experienced in my trauma, healing, and putting my own personal feelings aside and really using it as like, ‘You know, someone who’s gone through this,’ to make it more personal and not just like a news headline that the sexual assault at this fraternity happened,” Pollack said.
Her decision to bring Breaking Silence Co.’s exhibit to USC was part of her chain of presentations at various Greek Life organizations on campus and her overall goal to educate and proactively engage the Greek Life community in this exhibit.
“I’ve presented this semester in 13 of the 15 USC chapters on my lonesome,” Pollack said. “It’s been pretty empowering. So far, the response has been really amazing. People have really stepped up to advocate for other survivors in the system that have been silenced and also themselves.”
“It’s been pretty empowering. So far, the response has been really amazing. People have really stepped up to advocate for other survivors in the system that have been silenced and also themselves.”
USC is still reeling from sexual assault reports occurring at fraternity houses, including Sigma Nu, Chi Phi Eta Delta, Delta Tau Delta and Phi Kappa Tau, last October that let the University to place four fraternities on interim suspension and one on modified suspension. Ten fraternities have since disaffiliated with the University, while the still-affiliated Sigma Delta Alpha fraternity has limited operations as of publication.
Pollack said that when she was raising the $10,000 to bring the exhibit to USC, she thought about fraternity members as the exhibit’s target audience.
“I started thinking, ‘Who really needs to walk through this exhibit the most?’” Pollack said. “Their members of that community are kind of where I targeted. ‘You need to be here. I need you to walk through this, please.’”
Alli Meyerhardt, founder of Breaking Silence Co., described the upcoming exhibit, emphasizing the ways visitors can engage with it. Instead of staged scenarios, the exhibit will feature the unfiltered stories of survivors in an immersive environment.
“You hear those stories on a headset, and then we recreate the settings of wherever the abuse or violence and healing took place,” Meyerhardt said. “Those three stories are coming from the actual survivors. They wrote the scripts, they recorded the stories themselves.”
The exhibit coming to USC is part of Breaking Silence’s flagship program. The exhibit is hosted by a wide variety of institutions that seek to experience the immersive program and learn.
“We work with universities, bars, breweries, businesses, government agencies,” Meyerhardt said. “And our whole thing is we use stories in order to ignite a conversation around what is interpersonal violence and promote healing and empathy for those who walk through our program.”
“Our whole thing is we use stories in order to ignite a conversation around what is interpersonal violence and promote healing and empathy for those who walk through our program.”
The stories will engage with the harsh reality of sexual violence in a blunt manner. To give a taste of the content, Breaking Silence’s Co.’s online audio tour features a woman describing her experience with her abusive husband.
“He would hold his knife to my pregnant belly and threaten to kill the baby or cut the baby out of me and leave me for dead. I can still see myself pinned to the wall with a knife to my throat on Christmas Day,” the woman describes. 
The stories will convey the emotions felt by not just the survivors, but the offender. Of the stories that will be on display, some will feature the perpetrator’s perspective to give a rare perspective on sexual assault and healing. 
Miranda Kofford, a senior majoring in theatre and board member of A Path 2 Courage, explained that the impact of hearing the perspectives of the perpetrators will help people to understand just how severely sexual assault can derail the lives of the victims.
“It’ll inspire everyone who goes to the exhibit to think about [sexual assault] as a big picture thing, rather than just a blip,” Kofford said. “That’s something these men and these perpetrators don’t understand is the impact it can have on the victims and the victims’ families and just the community: everyone around them is affected.”
The content is so immersive, Meyerheardt said, that, alongside student volunteers from Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, licensed therapists will be present to inform students of resources available and help them digest the material.
Leenie Baker, the wellness director at USC Hillel, described the importance of having a safe space to engage with exhibit’s hard topics. The therapists present at the exhibit will be one way to facilitate that. 
“A huge part of the exhibit is trying to keep it as safe and secure a place for students to engage with an uncomfortable topic area,” Baker said. “In order to make that happen, we are having a licensed therapist present basically the entire exhibit.”
Meyerhardt said it’s important to have difficult conversations by placing visitors in the setting and unearthing survivors’ emotions in the exhibits. 
“The goal always is a common understanding of how do we have hard conversations? How do we enter into spaces with empathy as a form of prevention?” Meyerhardt said.  
Pollack also expressed what conversations she wanted to start among students, emphasizing her long term goal of creating a culture of fighting sexual violence on campus, and of persuading men to fight against sexual violence. 
“[Attendees] can have a meeting afterwards to debrief – ‘What did you hear? What did you feel?’ – and really start the conversation,” Pollack said.
A previous version of this story stated that the exhibit would visually depict scenes of sexual assault. The exhibit will instead show settings where interpersonal violence has occurred. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

One of the first things ingrained into our young, impressionable minds was what we were going to be once we reached that mystical age of adulthood. In this way, we were raised believing in the inevitability of work, and that one day, we will have to wake up every morning and go make money so that we can live. Some of us were raised to not even consider another choice — as far as we knew, there wasn’t one. The same still holds true — perhaps more stubbornly than before.
For most of our educational careers, our decisions are driven by the effect they would have on a future career. You stay away from detention so it doesn’t go on your record. You do more extracurriculars and community service than you would really like in order to stand out in your college applications. You pay attention in class, take standardized tests and stress endlessly to ensure that you maintain the high grades you need to get into a “good” college. You work just as hard in college and join just as many clubs to get an internship and the “work experience” needed to actually work. But why is this our end goal? 
What even is a “good” job? It depends on who you ask. For some, it’s one that earns you enough to live comfortably — a nice house in the suburbs, the latest electronics, enough of your favorite snacks to stock a pantry and the money to go on the occasional vacation. For others, it’s a job that they love unconditionally, regardless of the salary. Suffice to say, almost everyone has a different idea of what a good job looks like — but it is almost always related to their quality of life.
The job you have should not determine your quality of life. In fact, it shouldn’t have anything to do with it. If you think about it, the fact that we spend our entire lives preparing to work is pretty strange — that can’t be all we’re meant to do. Rather than searching for a career that makes us happy in itself, we should favor careers that allow us to do what makes us happy outside of the realm of labor. 
Yes, liking your job is important because it’s something you will have to do daily — but it shouldn’t be what our happiness is dependent on. We should derive happiness from the things we hold closest to our hearts, like spending time with loved ones or finally accomplishing that one thing you’ve always wanted to do. If you want to travel, get a job with the flexibility that allows you to do that. 
In trying to dispel the pattern of working soul-sucking jobs simply because they earn you an ideal salary, we have tied ourselves to this narrative that we must love our jobs completely and irrevocably, or else we will live unhappy lives. By doing so, we let corporate America determine our happiness. 
In turn, we constantly worry about whether our majors or the careers we’re working towards will unrealistically be ones that we will love every single day and will never have any qualms with. In reality, it doesn’t have to be that way. We can enjoy our jobs, but if they’re not our favorite part of the day, it should be completely fine, because we should have other aspects of our lives that make us happy. This is why the concept of work-life balance is so incredibly important.
Oftentimes, when you hear the phrase “work-life balance,” you hear the voice of a jaded Gen X-er saying something along the lines of, “Kids these days want everything to be handed to them on a silver platter.” It’s not surprising coming from people whose parents found no issue with 12-year-olds in sweatshops — but it’s not as crazy a concept as they may think. Work-life balance is simply balancing your career so that you have ample time to pursue your passions and live the life you want without the burden of a 100-hour work week — for example, a job that allows you to work remotely, or a job that allows you to take time off just to recharge, or that gives more than an almost criminal 14 vacation days per year. 
As USC students, we stress so much about internships and recruitment season and other blood pressure-raising career-oriented responsibilities. The USC Alumni Association, the Trojan Family and the corporate buzz terms we hear daily (like “coffee chats,” which sadly don’t even involve coffee half the time) all push students into a very career-oriented mindset. We’re far too accepting of the idea of a 100-hour investment banking internship work week, and plenty of us even seek this out, leaning on the idea that we’ll stay in the industry for “just a year or two” — then focus our attention elsewhere. 
While it’s important that we take advantage of the career opportunities available to us, it’s not necessary to revolve our lives around them. In our search, we should look for opportunities that allow us to be happy human beings — outside of the hotshot corporate office. 
We don’t have to unconditionally love our jobs. We should, however, love the fact that they give us the time and space to love our lives. And if that’s not the case? Just quit.

As the most iconic director of the 20th century, Orson Welles is often considered the “ultimate auteur.” Ambitious, egotistical and domineering, Welles relentlessly pushed for his visionary ideas to come to life on both the screen and stage. However, in order to tell Welles’ story, USC School of Cinematic Arts students and alumni needed to challenge exactly what this legendary figure stood for in USC Originals’ latest film “Voodoo Macbeth.”
Focusing on the 1936 theatrical production of Shakespare’s “Macbeth” with an all-Black cast directed by an inexperienced 20-year-old Orson Welles, “Voodoo Macbeth” highlights the chaos and beauty that emerged during the making of the show, as political tensions, egos and cultural differences clashed. Only when Welles learns to relinquish his hubris and respect the voices of his fellow artists does the production finally come together to transform into a hit sensation. 
 “The message that [the film] sends is really important; it is a message of collaboration and a message of believing in one another, taking a risk and learning how to be an artist,” said Sabina Vajrača, one of ten directors on the film and a graduate of SCA’s Masters of Fine Arts in film and television production program.  
Both on and behind the screen, “Voodoo Macbeth” embraces collaboration as a key foundation of creating art. With ten directors, eight writers and three producers, the film strays away from the sole auteur approach in favor of a new style of filmmaking based on diversity and teamwork, satisfying the mission of USC Originals, the University’s production company which provides SCA students with the resources to create films, like “Voodoo Macbeth.”
“USC Originals was inspired by the realization that we have an enormous number of very talented filmmakers both in undergraduate and graduate programs, who are yearning for an opportunity to work on both feature films and television,” said John Watson, SCA professor and executive producer on “Voodoo Macbeth.” 
The film came to fruition in SCA’s Feature Film Writing and Production class, where students write and produce a film under the direction of Watson. In 2019, Watson gathered a group of student screenwriters to create a television-style writer’s room that worked to develop the script for “Voodoo Macbeth.” Then in the following months, after ten graduate directors as well as three producers were chosen from a large pool of applicants, the film dived into production with students and alumni joining forces to bring the picture to life. 
Vajrača and SCA alumnus as well as producer on the film Jason Phillips both expressed gratitude and excitement for the unique opportunity “Voodoo Macbeth” provided for film students, like themselves. 
“For a lot of us on this project, it [was] a launching pad for us to work on independent features and gave us a chance to break into that field,” Phillips said. “And specifically for me … I was shocked that I had not heard this story before, as someone who loves theater, and I thought I need to be a part of this [since] it aligned both my professional and creative interests.” 
With such a large crew and cast, one would assume that it would be an unachievable feat to get every artist on the same page without any conflicts arising. After all, as the film portrays, collaboration is not always easy when dealing with artists.
“It’s [like having] ten cooks in the same kitchen. Everyone wants to be a chef, right? And on top of it, we’re all just graduating from the top film school in the country being told that we’re the best, right? There could have definitely been a lot of ego issues,” Vajrača said. 
However, in order to create a positive environment that would enable cooperation and respect amongst the filmmakers, Watson provided everyone involved in the film with wise advice: “Leave your ego at the door.” Thus, in addition to collaboration, communication served as a leading principal on set. From extensive pre-production meetings, where directors discussed every element of the script, to test shootings, the filmmakers constantly opened themselves up to constructive feedback to ensure that the film remained tonally cohesive and consistent. 
“It [was] about continuously communicating with one another –– we just did so many meetings, like we would do 10-hour days, where we would have each director come in with all the department heads and the producers,” Phillips said. 
The directors as well as the below-the-line crew worked together to establish the same “basic visual language.” However, at the same time, the directors still possessed enough creative freedom to insert their own style and perspective, with each of them in charge of directing a sequence within the film. 
“Once we created a basic visual language, then we could play with it in our own way,” Vajrača said. “[It’s] basically like we all spoke English, but everybody had a different accent.” 
 Debuting at over 20 film festivals, “Voodoo Macbeth”  received many accolades from Best Feature Film to Best Director(s). As the film continued to screen at festivals across the country, it came to the attention of Lightyear Entertainment, an independent film studio, who ultimately attached itself as a distributor. 
As the first USC Originals film to receive a theatrical release, “Voodoo Macbeth” has become a major accomplishment for not only the cast and crew but also the student filmmaking community as a whole. 
“A lot of people discount [student films] and they think it’s not going to work … [This film] provides a way to remove the stigma and bring a professional nature to [student films],” Phillips said. “We had a mission to put [the film] out there and to learn everything we could about the distribution process … we really pushed forward to get that.” 
Emulating Welles’ daring spirit, these rising filmmakers are not afraid to push back against the traditional boundaries of the entertainment industry and place their voices front and center in Hollywood. “Voodoo Macbeth” reflects the future of filmmaking in the hands of young artists. 
“We are certainly pioneering something completely unique. When [USC Originals] started out, there were a lot of people who told me this was a crazy notion. And it probably was, but it has taken collaboration [to make it work],” Watson said.

I have never given 100% of myself to something. I’ve simply never been able to. 
When I was in third grade, I would yak a majority of the mornings,and any day that I was lucky enough to keep down my breakfast, I felt like I could at any moment. Multiple times, I found myself at urgent care because I couldn’t breathe at night. 
Any day I didn’t have to go to school was a blessing to me — which is so ridiculous considering I had friends and school came pretty naturally to me (at least it used to) — still, I remember being exhausted and unhappy before I hit double digits. 
Once middle school hit, I dreaded any time my friends would ask me to hang out because it meant I had to leave the comfort of my bed. This led to faking illness as often as I could without raising too much concern.
In high school, I would find myself having panic attacks in the middle of classes and missing weeks of school due to intense exhaustion as the weight of getting out of bed became too crushing. Everything around me felt like it hit rock bottom in my first semester of junior year, when I missed around six weeks of school and dropped all of my classes besides English and math. 
With my lack of motivation and constant prolonged absences, extracurriculars were not my priority. I’d like to blame my debilitating depressive episodes that destroyed any possibility of joining the fun extracurriculars my peers were in, but even then, was I even into those extracurriculars? Or was it just pressure to get into college and do what my friends were doing?
I’ve realized that I’ve never had a passion, which has led me to become an envious person. A part of me breaks everytime someone talks about how they’ve danced since they were five, painted since they were eight, or started playing the drums before they could talk. Then the spiral of self-loathing begins — hating myself for never pushing myself to do something. I don’t know what I like, what I’m good at or who I am. Everyone dreads the small talk “what do you like to do” question, but for me, it got to the point where I didn’t like anything. 
I do realize how melodramatic I sound writing this, (I blame Lorde), but it’s hard to not feel a deep regret for the, albeit short, life I have lived. Still, every time an older person reminds me that my youth is meant to be the best years of my life, that pain of regret hits me. 
Mentally, I’m in a much better place than I think I have ever been. I can’t remember the last time I couldn’t catch my breath, and I find myself in class every day, even when it’s not mandatory. While I do love to complain, every day I am thankful I can get out of bed. I guess life truly is a blessing or whatever other corny message is on the sign above the farmhouse sink of a freshly-renovated two-story suburban house. 
Currently, I’m working on forgiving myself. It’s a challenge to try and convince myself that my seemingly wasted years weren’t wasted. I needed that time to heal. 
There’s not much I could’ve done differently. There’s nothing I can do now to change the past. I quit piano and sports and haven’t touched a paintbrush since I quit art class. I probably will not pick any of those things up again.
However, here I am now, writing silly little articles every week and having fun doing it. I didn’t even want to be a journalism major — schools just required me to put a major, and I was told putting undeclared isn’t good. I never thought of picking up an editor role until I was asked to apply. Now, I get to spend my time reading some of the most incredible pieces of writing from a variety of students on campus. Even when the work feels overwhelming, there’s not a moment when I feel like I need to quit or that I can’t do it. 
While I will continue to provide melodramatic monologues and sighs about my life, journalism and Daily Trojan, it’s all just for goofs now. I’m happy. I look forward to hanging out with my friends. Maybe it’s too far to say I’m happy to get out of bed — the snooze button still gets hit to the very last minute, but always with the knowledge I will make it out of bed.  
I’m not yet at the point to say “go girl, give us everything,” but for the first time, it’s not nothing. 
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world.

As did its titular soccer club, “Welcome to Wrexham” just wrapped up a very successful first season under new management. The new FX show followed the 2021-2022 season of Wrexham AFC, a Welsh club purchased in November 2020 by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. From the first episode, the duo make it clear their goal is to grow their club’s brand. The result is a show that does an amazing job of being accessible to all viewers, even those who go in with no knowledge about soccer. While this does have its benefits, it also makes parts of the show feel tedious to those who come in with prior knowledge of the English soccer system. 
The reason most would choose to tune in to “Welcome to Wrexham” is because of the star power leading the show. Ryan Reynolds is one of the biggest movie stars in the world and can draw an audience all by himself. When you add in Rob McElhenney, a creator and star of one of the longest running comedies of all time, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” you have yourself a show that is going to have an audience. But while they may be the reason people first tune in, Reynolds and McElhenney quickly become the weakest part of the show.
“Welcome to Wrexham” is made up of three storylines: Reynolds and McElhenney running the team, the team’s performance and the town of Wrexham, Wales. While these storylines are definitely connected, the beginning of the season is very Reynolds-and-McElhenney heavy. But as the season progresses they become less prominent with the team’s performance and the effect of Wrexham AFC on the town taking center stage.
While I do not doubt how much the club means to Reynolds and McElhenney and it is amazing what they have done for the town of Wrexham, some of their parts in the show, especially Reynolds’, feel very performative. For instance, during an episode where the focus was a single game, they constantly cut to an interview with Reynolds for his “live reaction” even though it is clear that the interview was that after the game. The show addresses this by having the team physiotherapist be upset when Reynolds delays practice to shoot a commercial. But it is shown to the audience in such a way that makes it seem like we are supposed to side with Reynolds and McElhenney doing whatever they can to grow the club’s brand. Despite how it’s presented, it’s hard not to feel that the two owners at times forget that the goal of the club is to win games.
While the Reynolds and McElhenney sections get more grating as the series progresses, the parts of the show focusing on the team and the town only get more engrossing. By the end of the first season, we get an in-depth look into the lives of a lot of the important Wrexham players: the homegrown young talent, an impactful defender, the goalkeeper and the two expensive attackers they signed. 
Finding out more about the players that we are rooting for is one of the most intriguing parts of the entire show, but it does lead to a pretty big question. For a show that reveals almost everything about the team, why do we not know anything about the captain? Even if all they did was say that he asked not to be featured, that would be enough, but to not even mention the captain for the entire season makes the show feel that it is lacking something.
What “Welcome to Wrexham” does best is make the viewer understand the impact that sports can have. Framing how much the team means to the town by using McElhenney’s Eagles fandom was a great idea, as American viewers understand that Philadelphia sports fans live and die with their teams. We see the impact the team makes on the town throughout the season with the town coming alive as the team starts to turn their season around. Kids begin to start supporting Wrexham instead of the big premier league clubs, a big sign of the revitalization of the club.
The first season of “Welcome to Wrexham” was an undeniable success that was very enjoyable. Hopefully they learn from this season so next season sees Reynolds and McElhenney take a backseat to the team and town.

When I decided to commit to USC in my senior year of high school, I knew what I wanted my graduation cap to look like. There would be the letters USC, and for comedic effect, I would have a picture of Lori Loughlin and her daughter Olivia Jade. When I told my mom my idea, she was horrified and told me not to because, “What if people think you bought your way in?” 
Although there were at least 50 people charged in the 2019 Operation Varsity Blues scandal, Loughlin is most often associated with the bribery scandals. The actress, who is known for her role in “Full House,” received backlash from the public for fraudulently paying $500,000 to help her daughters get into USC as recruited crew coxswain athletes. 
Like my mom, many people condemned Loughlin’s actions, which is completely understandable. It’s unfair that kids with extremely affluent parents have the ability to pay their way into college. There are deserving kids who worked honestly and arduously during their four years of high school, and they should not have their educational trajectory derailed just because they don’t have as much money as celebrity actresses. But, are Loughlin’s actions what we really should be focusing on?
It’s no secret that college bribery from celebrity and opulent parents has happened before the 2019 scandals. According to the New York Times, in 2011, 20 students were arrested on Long Island because they accepted payment or paid others to take the SAT and/or ACT. Bribery can never be fully stopped because some people will inevitably engage in unethical behavior, so what really matters is how we prevent corruption.
Instead of directing all anger towards parents like Loughlin, we need to consider the actions of the college, its officials and coaches. Representing USC and all it stands for, the faculty and officials should be devoted to their job and act with fairness and impartiality. In fact, USC’s mission statement declares that the school is “unfettered by political control, [and is] strongly committed to academic freedom,” so therefore, the school should reflect its beliefs, right? 
USC is no stranger to corruption and scandals. Staff members such as former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic, both of whom were accused of taking bribes, reflect poorly on the University’s principles. Moreover, when someone from a high position of power engages in unethical behavior, their actions humiliate the school to an even greater magnitude. For example, about a month ago on Sept. 15, former Dean of USC’s School of Social Work Marilyn Louise Flynn pleaded guilty to taking bribes and political corruption, which forced the school to lose face yet again.
Some people will argue that parents such as Loughlin deserve the criticism they’ve received, and I agree. In fact, I believe that the situation was downplayed because it seems that both mother and daughter weren’t held accountable enough. However, I don’t think that the actions of such unprincipled parents and their children give the University a bad reputation — it’s the unscrupulous faculty and staff who participate in dishonest solicitation that embarrass the school. As an academic institution, it’s imperative for USC and its faculty to uphold its mission statement and core values!
After all, if USC’s employees didn’t accept bribes, the school would have an extremely high, reputable character. The parents’ actions don’t have value or an effect unless their bribes are accepted. However, because USC has not stayed true to its core values, the school has been the center of many academic controversies, revealing the corruption of the higher education system. 
Although I am a student here, I find it hard to defend my university when my friends make comments such as University of Spoiled Children, University of Super Cheaters, or University of Scandals and Controversies because there’s some form of veracity in those names. The school needs to do something to prevent scandals and become the university its students and Los Angeles can always consistently be proud of.

If Sheffield-originated rock band Arctic Monkeys are consistent in anything, it’s their unapologetic, mold-shattering music. Their artistic versatility is evident in the defiant sonic evolution of their discography, which has topped British charts for the past two decades. Their style is almost unrecognizable in every era: ranging from heavy garage rock, punk rock, indie pop ballads, psychedelic R&B rock, and sci-fi lounge music, to the present orchestrated funk/soft rock. As frontman Alex Turner told Rolling Stone, “I think what makes it sound like the same band is that we’re not betraying our instinct to challenge our idea of what the band can be.” What else can we expect from the band whose debut album was the fastest-selling in UK history and titled “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not”? 
As the band grew older, their sound became more refined, meticulous and sophisticated. Turner’s signature poetic songwriting still revolves around coming-of-age themes, except, instead of partying and heartbreak, it’s about maturing and embracing change. Some fans are resisting this evolution since — news flash — growing older is hard to accept. Fans hold on so tightly because they lovingly dub them the voice of their generation  — a label Turner openly opposed for the pressure that came with it. 
These expectations ultimately constrain the artists, as said in “Sculptures of Anything Goes,” “Guess I’m talkin’ to you now / puncturing your bubble of relativity / with your horrible new sound.” In an interview with Alternative Press, the Monkeys assure they’re not abandoning their old sound, but following what feels like a natural evolution. Turner claims, “nothing about any of this at any point in the last 20 years has given me a reason to believe that you can go backwards.” Their ambition should be commended, not scorned on the basis of personal preference. 
The latest culmination of their talents combines all the band’s essential elements — playful and pensive lyrics, energized guitar, sublime piano, plus the integration of strings and Turner’s soothing falsettos. It “begins where the last album left off” with unhurried, luxurious arrangements, wistful sentimentality and infinite allusions. While he managed to create a world of his own in the last record, the polarizing “Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino,” “The Car” provides a method of transportation into various nostalgic worlds. It’s brilliantly atmospheric, transporting the listener into each song by completely immersing them in its textures and vivid imagery reinforced by the romantic vintage aesthetic in the music videos, which were directed by Turner himself and shot intimately on a 60mm camera. 
The complex yet seamlessly connected end result was achieved by spending more time than any of their other albums in “post-production”. The album is also comprised of new twists to things that are not entirely new in their catalogue — albeit approached from the present, as hinted by the lyric “there’s just enough time to swing by / and re-address the start / if you call and have them pull around the car / And stop specializing in stories from the road” in the song “Hello You,” which says goodbye to his past personas. 
The iconic opening line in “There’d Better Be A Mirrorball” says, “Don’t get emotional, that ain’t like you / Yesterday’s still leaking through the roof / That’s nothing new / I know I promised this is what I wouldn’t do / Somehow giving it the old romantic fool / Seems to better suit the mood.”
Yet, words are one piece in the cohesive whole — the album rewards each replay with a better appreciation for every layer of its spellbinding, retrospective enigma. In an interview with Apple Music, Turner reveals “I think it has as much to do with the other elements that make up the song as it does the lyrics. And like I said before, that instrumental on the front of it… I feel as though the first words are almost reacting to that piece of music”.  
The introduction perfectly sets the mood of the album by beginning with expansive piano harmonies, followed by stabs of violin, after which the piano returns crashing as waves of comfort over the listener. In “Body Paint,” the flickering imagery of the lyrics dance along each glistening piano note, then make way for the inexplicable feeling of the guitar riff climax. 
In contrast, the ominous “Sculptures of Anything Goes” has a desert-ier musical landscape similar to “Humbug” and was the first song guitarist Jamie Cook co-wrote since their debut album. The entrancing title track, as well as “Mr Schwartz,” begin with gentle fingerstyle guitar, intertwined with Turner’s crooning and feathery impressions left by the orchestra. Turner previously experimented with orchestration in his other band, The Last Shadow Puppets, and even has a movie soundtrack under his belt, since working on “Submarine” in 2011 (for which the acoustic guitar throughout the record is especially reminiscent). 
Originally, they’d meant to capture the momentum of live performances back in 2019, but once they got to the studio that impulse “went out the window” so “everything seemed like it wanted to move in this direction”. Even Turner was surprised by the outcome, saying he didn’t expect to want the end of “Body Paint” to be so distorted, yet that’s what he felt fit in the recording studio.
In many ways, “The Car” is Arctic Monkeys’ return to their roots while staying true to their creative impulses in a new facet of their ever-changing sound. It’s refreshing, airy and yet a twinge of melancholy still peeks through each tempo. The album art perfectly encapsulates this feeling: a forlorn car sitting on the top floor of an L.A. parking lot. Hopefully, history will not repeat itself and “The Car” will garner the recognition it deserves without waiting three years for fans to give it a chance only to end up loving it, as was the case for “TBH&C”. 
It’s amazing what these artists can accomplish with their independence from the rest of the music scene; it’s precisely what’s kept the band thriving in their decades-long trajectory and, luckily, it seems that’ll remain true for many more years to come.

After the implementation of the new NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) Policy, the landscape of college football has changed significantly. 
Players can now transfer to bigger programs that might yield more NIL money. Further, the NCAA changed the transfer rules to allow first-time transfers to switch schools without having to sit out a season. 
The result has been an environment where any player, unless they have transferred before, can transfer immediately to any team in the country.
Some coaches have called it “an open door to cheating,” or the “wild, wild West” while other coaches, like USC’s Lincoln Riley, have embraced the portal. 
Despite any individual’s stance, the transfer portal has not had the impact some critics expected this season.
The expectation among many fans, coaches, and pundits was that large football programs would only widen the gap between themselves and the rest of the field as they successfully corrall top talent from other teams. 
This has not happened across the board. 
Some large programs like USC, have certainly taken advantage of the portal. USC went from a 4-8 team that was painful to watch to a team that is currently 6-1 and fighting for a Pac-12 championship. Star transfers like Caleb Williams and Jordan Addison have been transformative and have turned the team around quicker ever before following the hiring of Lincoln Riley. 
Alabama, as expected, has also enjoyed the fruits of the relaxed transfer rules. Alabama junior running back Jahmyr Gibbs transferred from Georgia Tech. He is making his case for the Heisman, with 672 yards and 6 touchdowns on the season. 
Some critics did not anticipate the impact of talent leaving as talent arrives.
Former USC kicker Chase McGrath and wide receiver Bru McCoy have been difference makers at Tennessee. Both players have made game-winning plays for a team that is fighting for a College Football Playoff spot. 
Jaxson Dart, the quarterback at Ole Miss, also transferred from USC. He transformed Ole Miss into a playoff contender before they suffered a difficult loss at LSU. 
Kentucky and Syracuse, which have both been primarily associated with basketball in recent years, have had a resurgence in their football programs due to the transfer portal. 
Will Levis, a former Penn State backup QB, has been a difference maker at Kentucky, turning them into a top 20 team in the nation. Syracuse has had their best start since 1987 (6-0) after Garrett Shrader, an Ole Miss wide receiver, transferred to the Orange to play quarterback. Their record last season was 5-7. 
The impact of the transfer portal has reached even the most obscure teams. In their first season in the FBS, James Madison was able to breach the AP top 25 rankings with a talented transfer class. 
Even under perfect conditions, a meteoric rise of this nature would have taken years, if not decades without the new transfer portal rules. 
If the new NIL and transfer portal rules truly only benefit teams with historic, large, and wealthy programs, Texas and Texas A&M would not be absent from the rankings. 
These two teams boast the wealthiest programs in the nation, with some of the most elaborate recruiting infrastructures and have suffered against opponents with a fraction of the resources and transfer attraction.
The portal could definitely use some regulation, but it certainly isn’t “ruining college football.” At least not yet. If anything, it has made this one of the most entertaining seasons in years.
Some common-sense regulation could include a limitation on how many transfers a team can accept in one season. As a USC fan, I am happy Lincoln Riley raided the transfer portal before this season. 
As a college football fan, though, it is not in the best interest of the sport for a team to be able to take 20 players from the transfer portal in one season that are all able to play immediately. 
On balance, this season has proved that more relaxed rules can be a net positive on the NCAA. In only one season, the college football landscape has changed completely. The unpredictability is entertaining, and has made every week of this season interesting.

The women’s volleyball team received their second loss of conference play Sunday, losing 0-3 to No. 7 ranked Stanford on the road and ending a seven game win streak. 
The loss puts the Trojans at an overall record of 16-5 and 8-2 in conference play. Overall, the match was very lopsided, as the Cardinal dominated the first set and never looked back. In the first set, Stanford was able to pull ahead from a 13-13 tie, going on an 8-0 run to win the first set 25-15. The second set was defined by Stanford’s excellent serving and defense as they picked up 4 aces, 5 blocks and 6 kills to win 25-15. For the third set, USC could not overcome Stanford’s momentum as they were limited to 10 kills and a .360 hitting percentage while the Cardinal notched 22 kills and a superb .730 hitting percentage, winning the set 25-16 and completing the sweep. 
Throughout the day, Stanford outmatched USC in production, tallying more kills, aces, blocks, assists, digs and a higher hit percentage. 
The match marks the tenth consecutive loss for the Trojans against the Cardinal, with their last win coming on Nov. 27, 2015. Historically, USC is 21-67 against a Stanford program that boasts 9 out of the last 30 national championships. 
Head Coach Brad Keller attributes the loss to a combination of the team’s lack of execution and the opponents strong play. 
“I don’t think we were good in any category today, and I don’t mean that to be mean or rude,” he said. “I thought we pressed and we tried so hard and [it] just compounded and made things worse for ourselves. I thought they were really playing lights out today and we just didn’t have an answer.”
Keller believes that blocking is one of the key aspects the team can improve on as it can lead to better defense and more offensive output. 
“I would say we need to get better at blocking defense and especially the [transition] game,” he said. “The ball was just hanging off our arms and we were getting balls up, but we had to get free balls over because we can never get a rhythm going for some swings or quality swings.”
Coming off of a quick two-day turnaround from their matchup at Berkeley, the team had to deal with the challenges of playing on the road.
“Traveling in general is kind of hard on the body,” said sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga. “This is only our second trip [in the Pac-12] so I think we’re still trying to figure it out.”
Despite the tough loss, the team is eager to win again and compete for a Pac-12 championship and a spot in the NCAA Division I women’s volleyball tournament.
“I’m already super mad right now after a loss like this, so I’m just trying to get back in and get that work,” Tuaniga said. “I think this week’s practice and coming from there, it’s going to be a totally different story.”
Keller believes the team can compete with Stanford if they can improve their serve and pass game and blocking defense. 
“We have the firepower to hang with Stanford, but we can’t give them the runs that we gave them today,” he said.
The Trojans will get a chance at redemption Nov. 9 when they play Stanford at home.
On Friday, USC will look to bounce back and improve their standing in conference play as they travel to face the University of Utah at 5 p.m.
