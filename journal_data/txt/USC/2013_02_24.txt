Thornton School of Music violin professor Alice Schoenfeld donated $7 million to the school on Friday to establish the Alice and Eleonore Schoenfeld Endowed Scholarship Fund for Strings Students, a scholarship to support violin and cello students.
Schoenfeld also gave a $3 million endowment in October 2012 to name and renovate the Alice and Eleonore Schoenfeld Symphonic Hall, the school’s symphonic rehearsal space. The facility was renovated during the summer of 2012, adding an updated sounding system and audio and video recording capabilities.

Schoenfeld’s total donation of $10 million is the largest gift ever given by a long-standing faculty member. Schoenfeld’s contribution is also the largest gift to date for Thornton’s $75 million fundraising initiative, which kicked off Friday. The initiative is part of the Campaign for the University of Southern California, a $6 billion fundraising effort.
Schoenfeld has taught violin instruction and performance for more than 50 years at USC and currently holds the Alice and Eleonore Schoenfeld Endowed Chair in String Instruction.
The scholarship fund is named in honor of Shoenfeld’s sister, Eleonore, a cello professor at the Thornton School who died in 2007. The two sisters, known as the Schoenfeld Duo, toured internationally for decades. Schoenfeld made her debut at age 10 with the Berlin Philharmonic.
Before her death in 2007, Eleanore Schoenfeld was a professor at Thornton and the holder of the Gregor Piatigorsky Chair in Violoncello.
The $10 million donation is the second-largest gift Thornton has ever received, second to philanthropist Flora Thornton’s $25 million gift to name the school in 1999.
Schoenfeld hopes her donation will encourage future generations of musicians to strive for excellence and to really commit to their craft.
“True excellence in performance requires long hours, and the more support students can receive, the more they will be able to excel,” Schoenfeld said to USC News. “Performance and competition opportunities around the globe are invaluable in honing their craft and teaching them about the demands of a professional life.”

For many students, sleep serves as solace from the pressures of everyday life. But sometimes, stress manages to creep in the final minutes of consciousness.
“Getting enough sleep is always a struggle, but even when I’m falling asleep I constantly think about what I still need to do and feel guilty about it,” said Theresa Kurth, a senior studying aerospace engineering.
She’s not alone. An annual study from the the American Psychological Association found that more than 52 percent of millennials have stayed awake at night in the last month because of stress, and 44 percent of millennials reported feeling irritability or anger because of stress.
The APA also found that Americans between the ages of 18 and 33 have gotten worse at managing stress each year during the past three years.
Robin Siegal, an adjunct lecturer at the USC School of Social Work, said this might be because the millennial generation is coming of age during the worst economic times of our country, which contributes to the high levels of stress.
“They have college loans to pay, and they’re not getting jobs right out of college,” Siegal said. “Even to get a job or to get good benefits …  [they are] not available to a lot of this generation.”
Siegal said the competitive job market and economic pressure play a role in the stress this generation experiences. She added that millennials have also had to deal with changing relationship dynamics.
“Many of them have witnessed their parents getting divorces and their beliefs of the institution of marriage and longevity of relationships has been skewed,” Siegal said. “They don’t see family foundations as being permanent. They see it as temporary or transitional.”
Some millenials think there is a difference between how people deal with stress across generations. Sayuli Bhide, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said that her parents’ generation responds to stress differently than her generation.
“My parents will call me around 10 or 11 p.m. and ask me why I’m not going to sleep, and I try to explain that at that point I want to go to sleep, but I’m so stressed and I have so much to do,” Bhide said. “They don’t understand because they had a completely different experience growing up. They actually could get to sleep at 10 p.m.”
For Bhide, the generational gap brings another layer of pressure to her life.
“The amount of stress from then to now has changed, but my parent’s expectations for me has somehow remained similar to what was expected from their generation,” Bhide said. “That makes me even more stressed out.”
Millenials also tend to have more problems eating healthy and getting adequate amounts of sleep. The study found 29 percent of millenials feel they get enough sleep, compared to 46 percent of matures, which are considered people more than 67 years old.
The study also found that millenials are more likely to deal with stress in unhealthy ways, such as eating for comfort, drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.
On the other hand, millenials are much less likely to attend religious services to deal with stress — 16 percent of millenials attend services compared to 32 percent of matures.
At USC, some students who attend services find that the spiritual process helps to reduce stress. Aaron Taxy, a junior majoring in international relations, attends Friday night services at Chabad at USC regularly and finds the time valuable for reflection.
“We are always plugged in in a world of smartphones and Internet, which is generally a wonderful thing,” Taxy said. “However, it’s also important for us to unplug and be introspective, and services are a great platform for that.”
All of this can have serious implications in the long term, Siegal said.
“When people are experiencing long-term stress, they can go into depression or anxiety. They’re at risk for serious medical problems,” Siegal said. “Stress on a long-term basis can also affect hormones, like cortisol. Even on a cellular level, cells can be damaged because of long-term stress.”
But on a more pragmatic level, stress can be a debilitating force formany people. At the end of the day, students have find a way to cope, and taking one step at a time can be a helpful way to keep things in perspective.
“There’s only so many things you can do at one time,” Kurth said. “Stress doesn’t go away, and you can’t let it shut you down.”

Viterbi School of Engineering students will complete the process of repairing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s famous thermometer, which has been stuck at 70 degrees for more than a few decades.
Heatwave · The thermometer in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was mostly fixed by undergraduate Viterbi engineering students in November. The students created spare parts and an instruction manual. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
A group of 30 engineering classes proposed a bid for the revitalization with an initial budget of $300. Each class was responsible for one aspect of the project. Meanwhile, professional bids had projected construction costs to be between $5,000 and $10,000.
David Cape, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and a member of the Spirit of Troy drum line, spent long days playing on the field of the Coliseum. He witnessed the stagnant thermometer that always read 70 degrees. For more than 30 years, the thermometer in the Coliseum did not move.
The thermometer was installed in 1955 on the east end of the Coliseum.
Cape and his team members Charlie Palmer, Andrew Ezarik and Ryan Magruder created a prototype under budget at $280. Out of the three final teams, this foursome won and was given $1,000 to, as Cape described, “beef up the system.”
The final design was voted and chosen by a group of professors, including Yann Staelens and Charles Radovich, in association with the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission and Los Angeles Coliseum Commission representatives.
These improvements included polishing, fixing minor problems, and installing a backup battery that resets to 70 degrees automatically when the power goes out or is turned off.
The project was tedious, as team members dedicated lab time and free time to create the best possible solution for the historic venue. The four-member team had a final product ready for the last home football game in November 2012, but still continued to finalize their design by outlining the process of repairing the themometer in the future.
The backup battery system was installed in December and the final manual that outlined repair methods was completed two weeks ago. Now, the team focuses on creating spare parts in case of future repairs after their graduation.
Cape felt the process offered real world experience like that they would face after graduation.
“It felt very much like we were a company,” Cape said. “We were stumbling across trying to make it, do everything within a budget within a ridiculous time.”
Ezarik viewed the project as more than a project, but an opportunity for a legacy.
“It was cool to leave a mark on the school or leave somewhat of a legacy behind — to be part of a real engineering project, with real client, a tight deadline, and small budget,” Ezarik said.
For future generations of Trojans and Coliseum fans alike, the thermometer will stand not just as a measure of the weather, but as a reminder of the work that students with a passion can achieve.
“It was eye opening,” Cape said. “This is what I am going to be doing in real life, having a job and dealing with all the little things you have to think about.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Tuesday, Feb. 19, and Friday, Feb. 22. 
Crimes against a person
At 10:17 p.m. on Feb. 22, a female student on 3036 Hoover St. reported receiving an annoying phone call from an unknown person
At 3:17 p.m. on Feb. 22, a student residing in the Pacific Apartments reported her roommates for continually failing to properly lock the apartment’s front door.
At 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 21, a female student reported receiving annoying phone calls from her ex-boyfriend.
at 11:45 p.m. on Feb. 20, DPS officers responded to a report of an intoxicated student when a security guard at West 27th Place Apartments was pushed while being confronted about breaking a bottle. The security guard did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter and the student was subsequently escorted from the premises.
at 9:13 a.m. on Feb. 19, a faculty member reported that she sustained injuries to her hip and back when an unidentified subject on a skateboard collided with her while she was walking near the University Park Campus several weeks ago. The staff member did not report the incident at the time it occurred and sought medical treatment on her own. The staff member additionally stated that she was recently struck by a bicyclist on campus and the collision aggravated her condition.
 
Crimes against property
At 2:11 p.m. on Feb. 20, a suspect removed a seat from a bicycle secured to a bike rack.
at 11:59 a.m. on Feb. 19, a suspect walking past Chano’s snatched a student’s cellular phone from a counter where she had placed it while she paid for food. The suspect then fled on foot with a second suspect and disappeared from sight. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspects.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 2:11 a.m. on Feb. 22, a student was cited for underage drinking by Entrance Gate 1. The student was subsequently transported to his dorm room.
At 7:07 p.m. on Feb. 21, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect causing a disturbance at University Gateway Apartments. A check of the suspect’s name revealed three outstanding warrants. The suspect was arrested and transported to the LAPD 77th station for booking.
at 10:54 p.m. on Feb. 20, DPS officers responded to an intrusion alarm activation at the Montgomery Ross Fisher Building School of Social Work and, upon searching the building, found a student inside a computer lab. the officers told the student of the reason for their response, and he acknowledged that he knew the lab was closed. The officers then told the student that he was not authorized to be inside the building and he left the premises.
Oh yeah, removing your bike seat is a private matter between you and bike.   DPS should not involve itself in any individual’s personal sexual practices
Since when is a phone call a crime?
Since when is not locking your apartment door a crime?
Sometimes I think DPS has nothing to do.   LAPD would never bother with this sort of stupid stuff.

USC baseball stepped up in a 30-inning effort this weekend to take two of three games against the Cal State Northridge Matadors this weekend.
“We know we have to play well to win, and I think Northridge is a good team,” USC coach Dan Hubbs said. “They’re scrappy and they play hard to the end so this was a good test for us.”
Freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey took the hill on Sunday for the Trojans (4-3), pitching a complete game in only his second collegiate start to lead the team to a 4-2 victory against the Matadors (4-3). Twomey gave up two runs on five hits and three walks and struck out five.

“Getting to the ninth inning wasn’t really something of my concern,” Twomey said. “As cliche as it sounds, I was trying to take it one inning at a time.”
The Trojans gave Twomey the lead early in the second inning when the team put two aboard, setting up freshman designated hitter AJ Ramirez to knock in the first run with an RBI single. The team added another run an inning later when sophomore first baseman Dante Flores brought home redshirt senior centerfielder Greg Zebrack, who led off with a double to deep left field.
“If I could keep throwing up zeroes, it would be good,” Twomey said. “I knew every time it was going to get the offense going again, and they picked me up big time.”
Twomey was helped in particular by Ramirez, who posted 3-for-4 outing with 2 RBIs and a double.
“To see him go out there on the mound and do his thing, the whole field and the whole dugout is 100 percent cheering him on,” Ramirez said. “It’s awesome to watch [Twomey] pitch.”
The complete game was pivotal for USC, whose depleted bullpen got a much-needed break after stepping up in consecutive extra-inning games. Hubbs said the extra rest will allow the relievers to be ready going into their next game Tuesday.
The first two games of the series were both extra-inning affairs, with the Trojans losing at home in 11 innings on Friday evening but winning on the road in 10 frames on Saturday.
USC bested CSUN 6-5 in 10 innings on Saturday night, despite squandering a four-run lead in a four-error game that Hubbs called “atrocious.”
Despite coming out on top, the Trojans let a four-run lead evaporate in the bottom of the seventh by allowing three unearned runs on sloppy defense. The Matadors added the tying run that knotted the game at five apiece with a squeeze play in the bottom of the ninth.
Quelling a late comeback effort from the Matadors, freshman pitcher Sean Adler stepped up with runners at first and second and delivered a two-out save to help the team record the win.
The Trojans pieced together their winning rally when freshman right fielder Vahn Bozoian singled to start off the 10th inning, ultimately leading junior Kevin Swick to drive the winning RBI-single through the left side to put USC ahead.
The Matadors took game one of the series on Friday night with a couple of big offensive bouts, including a five-run 11th inning that ultimately gave them the 9-4 win.
The Trojans missed a series of opportunities, stranding 13 runners and failing to hold on to their two brief leads for more than two innings at a time.
After the Matadors broke open the flood gates in the top of the 11th, USC was unable to respond.
The bullpen will come off its Sunday rest thanks to Twomey’s spectacular outing and join the rest of the team Tuesday to take on Cal State Long Beach at home for a 6 p.m. game.

In an offseason fraught with instability among his staff, USC head coach Lane Kiffin has finally solidified his assistant coaching situation.
On Saturday, Kiffin announced the hiring of three new coaches to his staff:  Mike Summers, Tommie Robinson and Mike Ekeler. Summers will be the offensive line coach and running game coordinator, Robinson will be the passing game coordinator and running backs coach, and Ekeler will be the linebackers coach.
“I am excited to have completed the reconstruction of our staff,” Kiffin said in a statement. “It was a very exhaustive and thorough process. Mike Summers, Tommie Robinson and Mike Ekeler bring extensive coaching backgrounds to the Trojan program. They all are looking forward to start working with our players immediately.”
Summers has 33 years of coaching experience, with all but one season at the college ranks. He has primarily served as an offensive line coach but has also been an offensive coordinator. He has had career stops at Arkansas, Louisville, Kentucky, Oregon State and Ohio.
This past January, he was hired as Western Kentucky’s offensive line coach before coming to USC. In 2010, when he served as offensive line coach and run game coordinator, the Wildcats averaged nearly 140 rushing yards per game and scored the third-most points in school history with 406.
“Mike Summers has been an integral part of many high-powered offenses, including one that led the nation in scoring,” Kiffin said. “I was particularly impressed by how highly regarded he is by fellow coaches and by the players he has coached.”
Robinson has coached running backs for the Arizona Cardinals over the past three years. In 2011, he helped Beanie Wells become the first player in franchise history to rush for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Prior to his stint in Arizona, Robinson coached at Georgia Tech for four years, with one year as wide receivers coach and three years with tight ends. Other stops in Robinson’s college coaching career include Oklahoma State, UNLV, Utah State, TCU and Arkansas. From 1998 to 2000, he helped coach receivers and special teams for the Dallas Cowboys, where he worked with Hall of Famer Michael Irvin and helped the team win the NFC East title in 1998.
“Tommie Robinson is a veteran who not only is an effective coach and teacher, but also is known for developing great relationships with his running backs,” Kiffin said. “I know he will do that here and hold our players accountable on and off the field.”
Ekeler last coached at Indiana, where he was the team’s co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for two years. Prior to that, he spent three years as Nebraska’s linebackers coach and contributed to a defense that, in 2010, ranked third nationally in pass efficiency defense, fifth in pass defense, ninth in scoring defense and 11th in total defense. The Huskers won the Big 12 North Division title each year he was on staff.
He coached three years as a defensive graduate assistant at LSU from 2005 to 2007. LSU ranked third nationally in total defense each year he was on staff and won the 2007 BCS national championship. Prior to that, Ekeler was a graduate assistant at Oklahoma for two seasons, during which the Sooners lost in the national championship game, once to USC in 2005.
Ekeler played at Kansas State under current KSU coach Bill Snyder from 1991 to 1994. He was appointed team captain by Snyder in 1994 and is the only player ever appointed captain by Snyder during his tenure at the school.
“I have followed Mike Ekeler’s career and have been very impressed with what he has accomplished on and off the field,” Kiffin said. “He will bring intensity, energy and command to our linebacker group. He is also a proven recruiter on the national level.”
Additionally, Kiffin announced that James Cregg will remain as offensive line coach, while associate head coach/special teams coordinator John Baxter will also coach tight ends. In addition, quarterbacks coach Clay Helton added the title of offensive coordinator.

Simply put, Sept. 15, 2012 was a rough day for a journalist intent on covering a potential national title run for USC.
Weaving my way through the horde of fans mobbing the 50-yard line of Stanford Stadium after USC’s then-shocking 21-14 upset loss to Stanford, I forged ahead down a tunnel in disbelief to a makeshift media tent with eight fold-up chairs — hardly enough for the reporters on hand to cover the early-season clash.
Such a site seemed apropos, I figured, of what might be the most disappointing post-game press conference I would see in my lifetime.
Given ever-optimistic senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s knack for putting disappointing on-field results in context, I strangely looked to the signal-caller to help me rally and forget the most deflating USC loss of my college tenure. After all, Barkley’s candor and poise often made me forget that I was covering a kid my own age.
But that night, that’s how Barkley appeared: kid-like and broken by a deluge of Cardinal blitzes, with the sense he had disappointed the Trojan faithful. With his pads still on as if he could retake the field, he slumped in his chair with his eyes downcast, struggling to manage even 10-word replies.
The subsequent losses and questions about interceptions and his unwise decision to return for his senior season undoubtedly snowballed on Barkley, robbing him of his patented Hollywood smile.
Friday’s press conference at the NFL Combine was Barkley’s first public media appearance since the Trojans dismantled Arizona State 38-17 at the Coliseum on Nov. 10, and the Mater Dei High School product finally resembled what USC fans have come to expect.
Standing resolutely at the podium for 17 minutes, he commanded the room with a ferocity unexpected from someone who has started at quarterback for the last eight seasons at powerhouse programs and never had anyone seriously challenge his credentials. The NFL Combine is a place where desperation can take hold, as players’ professional dreams can be dashed if they run the 40-yard dash a tick too slow or check in a quarter of an inch below 6-foot. Not immune to this fact, Barkley clearly didn’t appreciate having his college career scrutinized for faults.
Not trying to disguise the massive chip on his shoulder at all, Barkley set out to allay any fears that he wasn’t the same player who threw 39 touchdowns and seven interceptions as a junior. Barkley unapologetically cut off reporters who rambled when asking the predictable questions.
As for the first question pertaining to his health, Barkley insisted that his shoulder will be completely healed by USC’s pro day on March 27.
“I’ve thrown — with great velocity — deep balls already,” Barkley said.
Staring almost defiantly at the crowd of reporters, Barkley knew the drill. He fielded the questions with a measured grin before answering sternly. When asked if he could tolerate initially serving as a back-up after his years of starting, Barkley said that he will do whatever it takes, but added in no uncertain terms, “My plan is to start right away and to make an impact right away.”
For those who questioned his 2012 drop-off in production, he basically responded that talent evaluators who review his game film will note that he made incremental improvements to his game even though his statistics, for a confluence of reasons (read: offensive line play) worsened. He ultimately admitted that it’s “physically impossible” to always improve upon previous seasons’ statistics, especially when those statistics break longstanding Pac-12 records.
Though he did not throw at this week’s combine, Barkley made other gains, as he measured in at 6-foot-2 1/2 — at least half an inch taller than expected — and measured bigger hands than all of his chief quarterback competitors, important for talent evaluators who are concerned about ball security at the next level. Assuming Barkley displayed the same confident demeanor in his interviews with NFL personnel, it’s safe to assume that he helped his draft stock this week as much as he could without throwing darts to receivers.
If he wishes to secure a first-round selection and regain his status as the No. 1 quarterback prospect, however, Barkley must exhibit an ability to complete all of the necessary throws at USC’s upcoming pro day, backing up his words with shoulder strength.  Thankfully for Barkley, old friend and junior wide receiver Robert Woods, the Pac-12 all-time leading receiver, will be there running routes for him, also with an eye toward improving his own draft position.
It’s a little foreign to see Barkley — not just his team — cast in an underdog role. But if Friday’s press conference is any indication, the frustrated and sometimes despondent in-season Barkley looks to have been replaced by a much more dangerous person: a talented player with something to prove while his livelihood and reputation are at stake.

The USC women’s basketball team came into Westwood hoping to avenge a 68-54 loss to rival UCLA on Tuesday, February 19, and to end a season-high seven-game winning streak.
Unfortunately, The Women of Troy were unable to accomplish either mission, losing to No. 17 UCLA 63-58 on Sunday, February 26 in Westwood.
Junior forward Cassie Harberts led USC (8-19, 5-11 Pac-12) with 22 points, including 15 in the second half, and 11 rebounds. Sophomore guard Ariya Crook added 16 points (14 in the second half) and six rebounds, while junior forward Desiree Bradley added seven points on 2-of-10 shooting and four rebounds.
Free fall · Sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama scored just two points as USC continuted its slide with a loss to UCLA Sunday at Pauley Pavilion. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Nirra Fields and Thea Lemberger led the Bruins (21-6, 12-4 Pac-12) with 12 points each, while Markel Walker finished with 11 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. Fields and Lemberger combined for 11 rebounds, nine assists, and five steals.
The loss is the Women of Troy’s eighth in a row and their 11th in their last 12 games. Their last win came on January 27, when they beat Arizona 74-57 at the Galen Center. UCLA has won eight of their last ten.
USC jumped out to an 8-4 lead early, but were unable to make a basket for over six minutes, allowing UCLA to go on an 8-0 run and take the lead. The Bruins led 27-22 at the half, in large part because of USC’s 17 turnovers compared to UCLA’s eight, leading to 13 points off turnovers for UCLA versus only two for USC. Both teams shot 30 percent from the field, while the Women of Troy out-rebounded UCLA 23-18. Cassie Harberts had seven points and six rebounds at the half for USC, while Desiree Bradley added five points and three rebounds. Nirra Fields led UCLA with six points at the half.
Both teams came out ready to play in the second half, with the Bruins stretching their lead out to 47-32 with 9:09 left to play on a basket by Fields. The Women of Troy then went on an 11-0 run over the next two minutes to cut the lead to four.
The two teams would keep pace with each other, but the Women of Troy were unable to seize the lead despite cutting it down to as close as 51-50 with 3:05 left on a basket from Harberts. The Bruins held a 56-52 lead with 30 seconds remaining, and would make seven of eight free throws to seal the win.
UCLA would seize the rebounding advantage in the second half, out-rebounding USC 40-39 for the game. USC shot 35 percent from the field compared to UCLA’s 37 percent, and managed to close the gap in the turnover margin a little, committing 22 turnovers in the game to UCLA’s 18. USC was also able to capitalize on UCLA’s mistakes in the second half, scoring 15 points off turnovers as opposed to UCLA’s four, and dominated in the paint, outscoring the Bruins 20-6 in the paint in the second half.
The Women of Troy conclude their regular season with a pair of games at Arizona schools, as they take on Arizona (12-15, 4-12     Pac-12) on Friday, March 1 at 7 pm, followed by Arizona State (13-15, 5-11 Pac-12) on Sunday, March 3 at 12 pm. They then travel to Seattle, Wash. for the Pac-12 Tournament from Thursday, March 7 to Sunday, March 10.
Last season, USC was bounced from the first round of the tournament in a 69-55 loss to Washington State that came just five days after USC beat the Cougars in Pullman, Wash. 65-54.

On the day of the Oscars, the Trojans were left seeing stars at the Galen Center.
After USC defeated the Bruins in Westwood on Jan. 30, UCLA returned the favor in dominant fashion Sunday, defeating the Trojans 75-59. USC (12-15, 7-7 in Pac-12) rallied down the stretch to cut a 25-point second half deficit to just nine with just over four minutes to play, but the run stopped there. The Trojans missed their final nine shots and by the time UCLA’s David Wear went to the free throw line with UCLA (20-7, 10-4) up 71-59 and under two minutes to go, USC was down for the count.
Not this time · USC senior point guard Jio Fontan struggled in Sunday’s 75-59 loss to UCLA at the Galen Center, shooting 2-11 from the field and 0-3 from the 3-point line. Fontan scored 15 in USC’s Jan. 30 win at Pauley Pavilion. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“We didn’t come ready to play,” said junior center Omar Oraby. “Games like these, it’s not about talent. It’s about who plays harder, and (UCLA) played harder.”
The Trojans lost their second game in a row after they blew a 15-point second-half lead at Cal to end to their four-game winning streak. USC falls to 12-15 on the season and 7-7 in Pac-12 play, with the loss all but eliminating any shot of a first-round bye in the Pac-12 tournament. The Bruins improve to 20-7 overall and 10-4 in conference play.
Junior shooting guard J.T. Terrell had 14 points in the second half to finish with a team-high 17 while Oraby had 11, his highest scoring output in a Pac-12 game this season. Senior forward Eric Wise pitched in 10 points, while junior forward Dewayne Dedmon had 12 rebounds and three blocks. Senior point guard Jio Fontan struggled mightily, scoring just four points on two-of-11 shooting.
“Other guys have to step up,” USC head coach Bob Cantu said. “Jio’s shots just didn’t go down for him tonight.”
Shooting guard Jordan Adams led UCLA with 20 points on 7-11 shooting, while Wear had 10 points and 11 rebounds starting in place of his injured brother, Travis.
Any rivalry loss hurts, but the lack of competitiveness early was surprising for a USC team that had been 5-4 under interim head coach Bob Cantu heading into Sunday. The Bruins blitzed USC early and often, scoring the game’s first seven points and racing out to a 17-4 lead less than five minutes in. Plagued by awful transition defense and even worse shot selection on the offensive end, the Trojans found themselves in a double-digit hole for most of the opening half. UCLA opened on a 10-of-13 tear on the offensive end, while the turnover-happy Trojans shot just four-of-17 in the early going.
“Never once did I think we couldn’t come back and win, but unforced turnovers [are] where we gave the game away,” Terrell said. ”We had turnovers and bad execution, and gave up easy baskets.”
Everything that went right for USC in Westwood turned on the Trojans this time around. USC dared UCLA to take the outside shot, and the Bruins nailed six of their 10 3-pointers in the first half. Though many expected USC to have the decided advantage in the post with Travis Wear out, the Bruins also matched the Trojans in the paint in the opening half.
The Trojans cut the deficit to ten at 29-19 with 8:27 left in the half, but the Bruins kept surging. Fueled by an up-tempo style that the Trojans couldn’t keep up with, UCLA went on a 10-3 run to take a 47-26 advantage into the half, USC’s second-biggest halftime deficit all season.
“We struggled offensively early and got in a big hole, and we couldn’t get out of it,” Cantu said.
The Trojans’ offense started off the second half on a better note, making four of their first six shots. The defensive effort didn’t show up out the tunnel though. The Bruins continued to carve up the Trojans down low, pushing the lead to 51-26 after two quick layups by guard Kyle Anderson. The Trojans countered with a 7-0 run to cut the deficit to 18 at 51-33, and from there the sides went back and forth. Already a chippy game full of fouls and aggressive play, the tension reached a peak at 59-42. After a Wise foul, Oraby and UCLA guard Norman Powell got in a scuffle for the ball. Both where whistled for a technical foul.
This also led to a questionable move by Cantu. Oraby scored the next possession, but committed his third foul a minute later with 10:31 to go. Cantu pulled the 7-foot-2 center out of the game for good, going small down the stretch despite Oraby having his way in the post the entire game, finishing five of six from the floor.
“It’s the coach’s decision, and I don’t know why he did that,” Oraby said about being sat down after the foul. The Bruins shot just 33.3 percent in the second half, but USC’s offense sputtered when it mattered most.
USC plays next on Wednesday against Arizona at the Galen Center, with tipoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m.
Time to clean house with both the men and women teams. Basketball has reached the bottom of nowhere,
and a fresh start with new Coaches is needed immediately if not sooner. A new aura has to cover the Galen
Center to rid this arena of all the bad vibes that have been built up the past few years. This is a no brainier for
the Athletic Dept. unless they bury their heads under Heritage Hall.

There are certain shows that you just need to watch live — shows with extreme cliffhangers or addicting dramatic moments where DVR-ing them or waiting for the episodes to go on Hulu simply is not an option. However, it is possible — normal even — for people to be fans of shows that they do not watch live.
That does not mean that these shows are not entertaining dramas or sitcoms. More often than not, it just means that viewers are busy and prefer to watch the shows on their own time when it’s convenient for their schedules.
Innovative, funny, new shows are being cut short and not given a proper chance because of that, though. Meanwhile, other shows that have been going on for seemingly forever just seem to keep going (like the Energizer bunny or something).
The ABC family sitcom, Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23, is a prime example. The show, which was canceled because of initially low ratings, speaks to the hypocrisy of the ratings system on the survival of new television shows.
On “GetGlue,” a mobile app to track television shows, movies and sports, avid fans of Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23  commented on the cancellation with attitudes ranging from, “give these shows a chance to succeed before you (cancel them)” to “still watching my DVR episodes.”
James Van Der Beek, who played a version of himself on the show, made a valid point as to why if a show has low ratings, it should not be immediately be eliminated from the TV spectrum.
“I know most of you watched us on your own time and platform and that the competitive network scheduling game is irrelevant to you,” Van Der Beeks said in a BBC article. “But network TV is a business dictated by Nielsen ratings and while that’s an antiquated business model, it’s the only one they’ve got.”
Though it came too late to save the ABC family sitcom, Van Der Beek’s point has gained new momentum: The Nielsen Company, which supplies audience ratings, announced Thursday that it will start including data from streaming services like Netflix in its statistics starting in September.
It is about time. It’s clear that with new technology, the ratings systems needs to be reexamined. However, though there are high hopes for the company’s pending system updates, the fact remains that there are extensive problems regarding these ratings — foremost the fact that the numbers still will not take into account all the online viewers who are binge watching.
Many viewers, especially those in college, watch television episodes online (legally or illegally, the latter a sad truth). Those fans do not get counted in the ratings game and are crushed when their shows get canceled, as is visible in fan blogs.
Ringer, another show that fell victim to the Nielsen ratings, aired 22 shows in its first and only season in 2012. Ringer had secret twins and murders and a fantastic cast including the dynamic Sarah Michelle Gellar, who superbly portrayed two characters. The season one average ratings were 1.82 million viewers, which was higher than the last three seasons of Gossip Girl. But because it didn’t have the cash that Gossip Girl had built up over the years, Ringer was axed while the long-running and arguably dried-up Gossip Girl continued to air.
Gossip Girl’s U.S. viewership had continuously diminished, with the last season receiving, on average, fewer than one million viewers. Despite its decreasing numbers, the show was still called back for that last season. So why did Gossip Girl get a whopping six seasons, while Ringer or Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23, which had equivalent ratings, were both cut?
It’s quite possibly because TV creators and executives are selfish. They saw the chance to extend air time on a franchise that previously garnered fantastic critical reception and high ratings, and so they decided to continue on with it, in hopes of monetary gain.
Granted, executives could be worried about syndication — the ability to sell the rights to another station to be broadcasted for reruns (100 episodes is the usual number used), but that should not undermine the start of interesting, unique new shows. And also, Gossip Girl had already reached that number before the last season, anyway.
Gossip Girl is not a lone example. Many long-running television shows are kept on past their prime to the detriment of quality, becoming extremely contrived and outrageous as the writers try to find ways to keep the show going a little bit longer for just a few more seasons. Meanwhile, new and interesting shows are not even given the chance to flourish or gain the following they could truly find given the opportunity.
Maybe it’s time to not just alter or add to the Nielsen ratings but to reinvent them and find a way to not just count how many people watch the original broadcast on a standard TV, but instead, measure the legitimate fan base.
For the sake of Van Der Beek and television in general, it’s time to update with the technology and the media ubiquity. Each college student who watches TV on “Project Free TV” is a fan going unnoticed.
If nothing else, it’s time to look at a broader fact: Ratings aren’t everything.
 
Mollie Berg is a freshman majoring in communication. Her column “Mollie Tunes In” runs Mondays.
I enjoyed your article, though I have some concerns with the examples used. The ABC show “Don’t Trust the B-” had many problems that lead to its demise, not just low viewership. Three out of the four networks had sitcoms lined up at Tuesday at 9pm. The comedy audience cannibalized itself, leading to the cancellation of both “B-” and “Ben and Kate”. Most of America just ended up watching CBS.
The change in the Nielsen ratings is a huge gain for networks, but it is just a small bandage on a larger problem. The Nielsen box is only available for 12,000 families. The sample range is too small to have a real chance of capturing what Americans watch. Nielsen has evolved to now examine Twitter trends, DVR views 3 and 7 days after live airing.  Illegally watching something online makes less of an impact than the TV executives think. Look at the Netflix bump. “The Walking Dead” garnered 12 million viewers recently, mostly from new viewers discovering the show online.
On developing a new series, it is cheaper to maintain an old show than start with a new show. Production costs, union mandates and pay bumps per season cause the networks to support aging shows to syndication and beyond. Even a third season season would be more viable than a second season, or if it has a notable star. “B-” was cancelled even though “Happy Endings” is moving to Fridays. “Ben and Kate” was cancelled even though it has the same ratings as “The Mindy Project” but Mindy Kaling is more known to TV viewers than Oscar-winning Nat Faxon.
So, if college students are watching shows online, it has little effect on favorite shows. At least we’ll have the Internet.

Sony officially made its move into the next-gen console market, announcing the Playstation 4 on Wednesday, Feb. 20 at a conference in New York. The conference featured the PS4 specs, the new Dualshock 4 controller and a list of confirmed projects for Sony’s next console.
Many game developers made announcements immediately after, making sure the next generation doesn’t have a shortage of triple-A titles. Guerrilla Games officially announced Killzone: Shadow Fall, the fourth title in the PlayStation-exclusive franchise. Sucker Punch announced Infamous: Second Son, the third game in the Infamous saga, and Square Enix released a trailer for a new Final Fantasy game. Blizzard Entertainment announced that its popular PC hack-and-slash game Diablo III will be making its way to the PS3 and PS4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was also announced for next-gen consoles and is expected to be released in 2014.
Sony’s conference also introduced a variety of new franchises to be released with the new platform. The first game announced in the conference, Knack, is a family-friendly platformer following the story of a robot constructed to defend humans against goblins and is able to alter his form in order to fight enemies or solve puzzles. Evolution Studios (Motorstorm) announced its new simulation racer DriveClub. Jonathan Blow (Braid) announced his new first-person puzzle/platformer The Witness. Capcom revealed footage of Deep Down, a third-person fantasy dungeon crawler similar to their recently released Dragon’s Dogma. Bungie (creators of the Halo series) released the first taste of their new project and first multiplatform release: Destiny.
But the clear high point of the show, and the reveal that was most intriguing to many gamers, was that of Ubisoft’s Watch Dogs, an open-world game centered around the manipulation of technology.
It was also announced that Media Molecule, Quantic Dream (Beyond: Two Souls), and Just Add Water (Oddworld) are working on titles for Sony’s next-gen console.
The PS4 will be controlled using the new Dualshock 4 controller, which features a touchpad, a share button, a headphone jack and a lightbar that tracks depth in a way similar to the Nintendo Wii. The console also features the ability to stream gameplay directly from the console, edit and send quick video clips and play games while they’re downloading on the console.
The PS4 will also sport specs similar to a typical high-performance PC, including an x86 processor, customized graphics processor and a Blu-Ray/DVD player, along with USB 3.0, Ethernet and Bluetooth.
A major point for gamers however, was what Sony did not mention at the conference. Even though Sony hinted at a release date of the 2013 holiday season, there was no official release date announced for the console or the games. The actual PS4 also didn’t make an appearance at the conference, despite the conference being dedicated to the next-gen console.
Overall, Sony came out with an impressive conference and proved that it is serious about bringing the best experience the company can on a console. Sony has its triple-A franchises ready to lead the company into the next generation in Infamous, Final Fantasy and Killzone, as well as having a more family-friendly mascot for the new platform in Knack.
In addition, Sony has addressed some issues present in the current generation of consoles, allowing for a more enjoyable gaming experience that more closely resembles that on the PC.
The electronics giant, however, missed out on answering some major questions consumers have, such as the price, official release date and what the console looks like. If the games slated to launch with the console live up to their potential, then gamers who purchase a PS4 will have plenty to keep themselves occupied over the holiday season.
Answering the question of whether or not the PS4 will be better than the next Xbox, however, will have to be pushed back until Microsoft reveals its new console later this year.

On first glance, this could be any party on campus: Fists pumping in the air, music bursting through the speakers and spotlights giving the venue an acid-trip glow.
For the kids · USC students danced the night away in support of local hospitals affiliated with the Children’s Miracle Network Dance. The annual 12-hour event had “theme hours” throughout the night, such as the ’90s hour. – Karen Pham | Daily Trojan
 
But upon closer inspection, it is clear from the balloon animals adorning students heads to the young children dancing that this isn’t your typical USC rager — this is Trojan Dance Marathon.
For the past couple of months,  the people behind the event have been working hard to make the night a success. From making their mark on campus in the form of neon flyers to sidewalk chalk announcements, they advertised and promoted the dance until the last moment leading up to the annual event.
The core members of the annual Dance Marathon at USC — more widely known as Trojan Dance Marathon — can now breathe a sigh of relief after yet another successful 12-hour charity event.
Dance Marathon is a nationwide event held at more than 150 colleges, including USC, that aims to raise money for local hospitals affiliated with the Children’s Miracle Network.
The Trojan Dance marathon is in its sixth year at USC and has grown tremendously since its earlier, humbler beginnings. Originally, the Trojan Dance marathon started in the 1990s, but because of a lack of interest, the momentum behind the event faded away. But the idea resurfaced again in 2007 when then-sophomore Suzanne Fitzgerald and freshman Scott Slesinger, two USC students who had both heard about these annual dance marathons, crossed paths.
After finding an advisor and meeting with board members of the Children’s Miracle Network, USC held its first dance marathon at Ground Zero and raised $6,500 during a six-hour, 200-person event. In 2009, the event was moved to the Lyon Center because of increased attendance and interest. But the next year saw even more participants and so the marathon was moved to one of the biggest venues on campus — the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom.
But this steady increase in awareness of the dance marathon was not by accident. Starting with Fitzgerald and Slesinger, word of this event spread with effective marketing and PR campaigns. The Trojan Dance Marathon founders implemented catchy slogans like “Feel the beat” on team shirts and branded the event to the point that most everyone on campus knew what “TDM” stood for, if asked.
And it’s this degree of passion and hard work that makes this event so popular.
Shelby DeWeese, who serves as the residential relations coordinator, joined the executive team after becoming smitten with the event and its overall message.
“A lot of times, fundraising programs can feel really mechanical and the Dance Marathon does a good job of fundraising and reminding the people who are involved about the other humans that they are impacting,” DeWeese said.
Like most dance parties, it takes some time to get warmed up, but at the Trojan Dance Marathon, it did not take long before the festivities were underway. From time to time, the marathon team came together to show off their practiced and polished dancing routines. “Theme hours,” such as the ’90s hour and around-the-world hour, were particularly intriguing segments that tailored the music and activities to a certain theme, keeping up a frequent change in pace that kept the dancers happy and active.
But on the back of the marathon shirts, the acronym “FTK” (or “For the Kids”) symbolized a theme that remained consistent throughout the night. Between theme hours and dancing, “Miracle Children,” current and former patients at the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, went up on stage and told their stories to the dancers.
For Jenny Chen, the external director of Trojan Dance Marathon, the driving force of fundraising for this event is, in part, what the kids have gone through.
“[The children] have such confidence and courage to share their story and they make us so in awe,” Chen said. “One of them, Eileen, is an amazing singer and even started her own charity with a friend. CHLA helped Eileen get past the illnesses she was battling so she can achieve her dreams. And that’s what we love to see.”
The final theme hour was rung in with glow sticks and upbeat music, signifying the home stretch.
In the end, a total of more than $50,000 was raised, an amount that came up a bit short compared to last year but still stands as an enormous sum.
In her last year at both USC and Trojan Dance Marathon, Director of Administration Sara McElroy said that she hopes to see the organization continue to grow.
“Dance Marathon is all over the country. One of the biggest ones is Thon at Penn State, and it’s so big and it’s the event of the year,” McElroy said. “If that could be here, I would love it. If it can’t but makes a difference in people’s lives [though], that’s all that really matters.”
 
Donations are still accepted one month after the Trojan Dance Marathon. If you are interested in donating to the cause, you can visit www.trojandm.org.
Sounds like a great event for a great cause.
All the planners and students should be proud of themselves!

Since the Halloween shooting at the center of campus, the University of Southern California has taken measures to ensure students’ safety, but they do not go far enough. Only students and registered guests, for instance, are allowed on campus at night or in the dorm buildings at any time. But though these measures might help students, they do nothing to defend against an armed and determined criminal.
It’s clear that shooters target schools — and students need protection. Lone Star College in North Harris, Texas — where four people were injured — is a recent example of a shooting on a college campus. In 2007, the largest gun-related massacre in the United States took place at Virginia Tech. And Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary gunman, apparently chose the school because it was an easy target.
Closer to home and on a smaller scale, two students were held at gunpoint just last weekend in an attempted robbery near USC on South Figueroa Street, according to a Dept. of Public Safety security alert. Guns on and around campus are a reality, and though the new security measures help, they haven’t yet fixed the problem.
The solution is clear: The only thing that can stop a shooter is another gun. Though the Los Angeles Police Department has an impressive track record catching people who commit crimes on USC’s campus, in the case of an attack, students don’t have time to wait for authorities. If there’s the possibility for someone to try and hurt students, classrooms need to be armed and ready.
Since the Sandy Hook shooting, various state and local governments have pushed for laws allowing trained teachers to carry loaded weapons. Schools in Texas and Ohio are even paying for firearms-training sessions and permits to carry concealed weapons.
Mirroring these policies, USC should fund optional gun training for all faculty members and change its policy regarding weapons on campus. According to the SCampus Handbook, people on campus are not allowed to have “unauthorized use or possession of firearms or replicas, ammunition, explosives, knives, flammable substances or other weapons.”
Instead of this policy, trained faculty members could be chosen to have access to firearms, which could be locked in classrooms. More DPS officers, along with those working at the Customer Service desks at student housing, could be armed and trained as well.
The Customer Service representatives ask each student for a fingerprint before entering student housing. However, there is no barrier other than the representative standing between a potential intruder and the elevator. This puts the representatives — and the entire building — at risk, making the training and arming of such representatives a potentially life-saving deterrent.
Finally, intruder protocol should be rehearsed along with the already instituted fire drills in classrooms and dorms. Though it is an uncomfortable reality, crime does happen on college campuses and could very well happen at USC.
Some people might be uncomfortable with firearms, but they’re the only source of personal protection in extremely dangerous and quickly developing situations. There are also those who believe that gun control is the only way to fix America’s problem with gun-related violence.
Yet the truth remains that when you’re facing an armed criminal and with no law enforcement in sight, the only way to fight back is with a gun of your own.
 
Leona Fallas is a freshman majoring in English and sociology.
DPS officers carry firearms and there is already a massive police presence in South Los Angeles. The last thing are more guns on campus. Furthermore, we must focus on the underlying issue which is the relative ease of access to guns and our ineffective policies towards people who are mentally ill.
Are you out of your mind? Like anonymous pointed out, the police can’t even be relied on to accurately take down an armed individual. How can we expect a professor with extremely limited knowledge and experience with a firearm to successfully disarm someone else with a gun. And with that kind of access to weapons on campus, the potential for shootings increases exponentially. There is no way to predict which person may be the next Adam Lanza or Seung-Hui Cho (VA Tech) which points to two things: an increase in mental healthcare in this country is a must, and having access to weapons in classrooms could potentially arm the next school shooter. There is no way this solution is in anyway viable.
Play Black Ops!
It’s not a bad idea as long as they get some safety training and pass a marksmanship test.
Worst idea Ever.
I think there are a few logical jumps in this article. FIrst, the Columbine shootings occurred despite there having been an armed guard on the high school’s campus. Not to mention the shooting in NYC last year where the cops (trained professionals, theoretically) managed to shoot more bystanders than criminals. And how many civilians got shot before the LAPD took down Dorner?
We can’t even rely on the police to effectively use their weapons, and you suggest we let every 65 year old tenured professor keep a weapon in the classroom if they so desire.
I also think you’re somewhat conflating two different proposals here. Do you think that only trained faculty members should have guns or the student body? You say “Yet the truth remains that when you’re facing an armed criminal and with no law enforcement in sight, the only way to fight back is with a gun of your own.” So my professor is entitled to fight back under your logic but I’m not? I’d rather take my chances having the police do their job properly than rely on the faculty to turn into amateur Rambos.
Yeah you’d take a chance on the police getting there with a 5 minute response time. Too bad a 5 minute response time often isn’t good enough. Adam Lanza ended his murderous rampage when he caught sight of a first responder (policeman) with a weapon and killed himself. Had that first responder been someone in the school (ie teacher or principal), he wouldn’t have had all the time to do what he did. She’s right: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
You don’t need a gun to protect yourself when a whistle will do just fine. #LiberalTips2AvoidRape
I completely disagree with guns being allowed in the classroom. Why should students feel the anxiety of knowing their teacher, who either is politically anti-weapon or not at all comfortable possessing a gun has been forced to do so? USC, despite its location, has not had a shooting on campus within classrooms. The shootings at other schools have not been because of their location but because of citizens or students who have found disappointment in their lives and wanted some form of revenge. To be honest, I would be extremely uncomfortable showing up to class knowing that there was a loaded gun in the classroom. We already have so much gun violence in the US, why add the potential for more unneeded and accidental gun injuries, or even deaths? Instead, we should be thinking about gun control on a state and national level that would prevent another Columbine, Virginia Tech, or Sandy Hook. How about instituting better mental health institutions on campuses and in neighborhoods that could provide another option than resorting to violence. It is difficult to imagine that a teacher would have been able to prevent the carnage brought about by shooters if they’re already being fired at before unlocking their gun cabinet and pulling out their gun. And if they don’t have the large-magazine guns as Mr. Lanza did, they don’t stand a chance. I highly doubt you believe teachers should carry ak47s in each USC classroom. How would we assure no students or residents of the USC area could not steal the guns and use them in exactly the way you are attempting to prevent? If you believe that the classroom should be a safe haven for learning, you would come up with plenty of other ideas before proposing we place a gun in every classroom. More guns on campus creates the possibility for so much more violence and creates a culture that becomes more about fear than about education.
Not to worry!  Those yellow jacketed security guards are all highly trained ninja fighters.   So highly trained they can deflect bullets with their hands and feet without any injury to themselves.
So while DPS is investigating complaints of annoying phone calls and missing bike seats, our yellow cloaked ninjas will save the day!
“Instead of this policy, trained faculty members could be chosen to have access to firearms, which could be locked in classrooms.”
yeah …. riiight… guns in lock boxes in classrooms, what a great idea!
My god. Giving guns to a bunch of drunk freshmen. Can you imagine the carnage?

The death of ex-Los Angeles Police Department officer and murder suspect Christopher Dorner provided closure for the families and friends of those who were murdered at his hands, not to mention the Southern Californian community at large.
Hailey Nowak | Daily Trojan
 
His actions? Inexcusable. Yet the entire Dorner debacle has forced dialogue regarding the effect race has in law enforcement back into public discussion.
In his eleven pages-long manifesto, Dorner said the LAPD frequently covered up racist activity during his time as an officer, even treating him poorly. And though one might hope that we are past the age of blatant racism, the fact remains that, in our time, individuals of minority heritage have a much higher rate of negative interaction with law enforcement agencies than their white counterparts.
In 2011, Nicholas K. Peart published an opinion piece in The New York Times entitled “Why is the N.Y.P.D. After Me?” documenting his interactions with police in New York City as a young black male. In the piece, Peart explains how he has been stopped numerous times without due cause and always with vigor that, to an onlooker, would look as if the police had an ironclad reason to stop him.
In reality, the only reason the NYPD had to detain Peart in these situations seemed to do with his profile as a young black male. Peart then said the experience “incorporated into my daily life the sense that I might find myself up against a wall or on the ground with an officer’s gun at my head. For a black man in his 20s like me, it’s just a fact of life in New York.”
It’s a fact of life in New York, but also all across the United States. Peart’s frisk was apparently a judgment based purely upon the color of his skin alone. Peart points out that 84 percent of the stop-and-frisk incidents in NYC in 2010 were conducted on people of color. In more than half of these occurrences, the reason for the stop is ambiguously attributed to “furtive movements,” or actions suggestive of guilty nervousness.
Considering that nothing comes of the vast majority of these stops, the identification of “furtive movements” seems unfounded. Therefore, Peart’s stop-and-frisk based upon skin color and gender alone is fallacious and indicates criminal profiling based upon race alone.
When looking at the description of Peart — a young man who dresses well, acts civilly and is getting a college education — one must consider the large number of people who fit that profile. For what it’s worth, I fit the description. In fact, near as I can tell, the only distinct difference between Peart and myself is the color of our skin. But where Peart has been stopped many times by the police without due cause, I have only been stopped once, and that was for going 80 miles per hour in a 65 zone.
It wouldn’t be too big of a stretch, then, to say that racial profiling by law enforcement is alive and rampant in America. It’s a deplorable aspect of many people’s day-to-day lives, and reveals how many parts of society are no closer to true racial equality than it was 20 or 30 years ago.
A common counter argument to this is the statistical fact that blacks and Latinos are more likely to be affected by violent crime than whites. Though there might be legitimacy to the statistics, one must consider another fact: that blacks and Latinos often live in a much lower socioeconomic bracket than average whites do.
There are several studies, such as Morgan Kelly’s 2000 study “Inequality and Crime,” linking frequency of criminal activity with socioeconomic status. This study, in conjunction with comparing crime both reported and unreported (as Lee Ellis does in Handbook of Crime Correlates), reveals that participation in criminal activity does not vary dramatically across race, but is highly tied to poverty.
Nevertheless, because of the wide practical assumption by some that white people don’t commit as many crimes as minorities, crimes by whites tend to be underplayed and regarded as abnormal both by law enforcement and the media. In contrast, as shown by Peart’s story, having skin of color seems like an automatic qualifier for at least some form of criminal activity.
Dorner knew this and allegedly experienced it firsthand in the LAPD, not only as described above, but also within the department itself. Although mental illness is most likely the leading cause behind Dorner’s actions, his manifesto is filled with stories of discrimination based upon race. It is entirely likely that the discrimination he received because he was black was, at the very least, a factor.
Too often people are afraid of discussing fundamental issues surrounding race in modern America, especially in regard to the forces here for our protection — the police.
But if there’s anything to take away from the Dorner case, it’s that this conversation must continue, lest we meet further consequences.

I’m amazed at how many uneducated people are taking Dorner’s word who has proven he is nothing more then a COLD BLOODED KILLER.  The tabloid media has mislead the public, reported false information and facts and continues to glorify this psycho. Only a few protesters were outside LAPD headquarters yet every media outlet reported that story. The LA Weekly was the only one to say it was less then a dozen people.  If people look at the big picture of LAPD having over 9,000 officers and this is an incident that is getting more press.  LAPD officers every day risk their lives and run towards the most violent gangsters around USC.  But the media fails to report the positive side of the good LAPD officers perform everyday.  They love to report negative stories to get viewers and readers.  Read how the LAPD Officers were killed in the line of duty like Randy Simmons saving a family.  Or the many officers who are shot and injured trying to help an innocent victim.  Why isn’t this reporter writing about all the gang violence surrounding USC and the gangs now infiltrating your school?
Have you read the unedited document yourself? It is too detailed to be a total fabrication. It includes names and case file numbers to reference. I think the local fox11 news is having the same kind of dilemma where they are trying to do the due diligence and find the truth, but believing the police misconduct in dorners manifesto is being associated with the approval of his methods.
The only proof we have of racism within the LAPD is ex-LAPD officer Dorner based on his own manifesto.  Ever notice that people who rely on the racism card to make excuses for their own ineptitude are generally racists themselves??
@Joe Friday – I haven’t noticed that at all.  I notice other officers have stepped forward since then and corroborated Dorner’s story though.  You sound like another dirty cop.
Why do idiots attempt to paint anyone who doesn’t agree with the cops breaking the law with impunity as Dorner supporters? It has much more to do with non-support for corrupt, inept, armed and dangerous police officers. They shot up an entire neighborhood, while trying to kill two newspaper delivery women in a vehicle that didn’t match the description of Dorners. They stopped a guy on his way to go surfing, also in a completely different type and color of vehicle than Dorner’s, let him go, then rammed it with their cruiser before opening fire on the skinny white guy. They were recorded intentionally burning the house down then come out and say “We never intended to burn the house down.” What the hell is wrong with you freaks who support this? It’s a shame the cops chose to commit arson rather than bring this alleged killer to court and prove him guilty. Instead of upholding the law they committed a felony. Now instead of a convicted murderer we have a martyr. Nice going fools. I guess that’s what steroid abuse will do to you!
