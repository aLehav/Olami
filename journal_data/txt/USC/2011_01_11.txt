Every year around this time there is a faint sense of renewal and change we really can believe in.
When the calendar flips to a new 365-day period, the talk is always about what we hope to achieve tomorrow, not of what we didn’t achieve yesterday.
Yet in these often best-laid plans, our fickleness typically gets the best of us and thwarts our ambitious attempts to lose those 20 pounds, quit smoking, attend class lectures on a more frequent basis or treat our relationships with care and the utmost loyalty.
But alas, in one last-ditch effort to keep the misguided tradition of making goals and lofty promises for the dawning of a new day, here are a few that are more than apropos for USC’s athletic program — who, could really use a year of good fortune in 2011.
Take the appeals decision with a grain of salt
For those of you ready to send gift baskets to Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton or Ohio State’s well-deserving 2009 Fiesta Bowl Sportsmanship Award winner Terrelle Pryor, think again before you hit the “buy” button on your Amazon.com shopping cart.
To believe that the NCAA’s negligence and gross oversight regarding these two recent incidents will somehow correlate to lenience in USC’s appeals case come Jan. 22 is frankly asking a lot of an organization that hasn’t exactly built itself on a foundation of logic or reason.
Watching 13 sanction-imposed football games this past year with feverish interest despite the lack of post-season buzz was a tall task, though many of you still rose to the challenge. From “Bowls are for Salad” to “You Can’t Sanction the Endzone,” a trying time was defined by your cathartic humor.
But, more than likely, get ready for some tongue-in-cheek comic relief, because although 2011 spells the beginning of conference expansion, don’t expect the higher powers to take a newfound look in the mirror in search of integrity or fairness.
Believe in the bench
USC men’s basketball play-caller, Kevin O’Neill, has a coaching pedigree which cannot be ignored nor largely criticized. But arguably the thing that stands out most for the Trojans’ second-year coach is his ability to lead programs to March’s highly-celebrated dance floor with little haste.
Every stop O’Neill has stayed for at least two years — Marquette, Northwestern and Tennessee — found itself in the NCAA tournament by the end of year two.
It is a streak O’Neill lists highly on his long list of resume-defining accomplishments. But it is also a streak that is in some serious jeopardy if he doesn’t learn to trust his bench of underused potential.
Freshman guard Maurice Jones has played all 40 minutes six times this season (and 41 minutes in the overtime loss vs. Washington).
If not for the fact that he reached the five-foul limit against Tennessee or the quick in-hand blowout win over Lehigh, junior forward Nikola Vucevic would be staring at a 16-game streak of at least 30 minutes logged.
And despite the fresh legs junior guard Jio Fontan likely has after missing the first 10 games of the year, you will be hard pressed to find him taking a cushy seat on the bench the rest of the way — as he has already tallied 34 minutes per game.
But if USC is going to make a run at the post-season and extend its coach’s personal streak, O’Neill is going to have to rely more on freshmen Bryce Jones and Garrett Jackson to contribute meaningful minutes off the pine.
It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish
Preseason rankings are flattering and always serve as a nice way to ring in a new year.
But as shown by the meltdown by Bill Ferguson’s men’s volleyball team in March a year ago, the No. 1 ranking is rather empty when it comes to guaranteeing postseason success.
This season, the Trojans again start as the No. 1 team in the country, with most media members and volleyball pundits picking them as not only MPSF favorites but also contenders for another National Championship.
From do-it-all senior opposite Murphy Troy to arguably the hardest working athlete in junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, Ferguson and company still have a team full of leadership, experience and cream of the crop talent in 2011.
But champions aren’t born on paper, a lesson learned the hard way a year ago.
(Southern) California Gurls’ talent is undeniable
I believe that as we welcome in a new year, fans, students and fellow peers can prove that sexism doesn’t run rampant at this 21st century university.
Call me crazy or naïve, but I think we recognize the talent this university boasts among its female athletes.
From the return of Jovan Vavic’s two-time defending NCAA champion women’s water polo squad to Michael Cooper’s much-improved basketball team, to the senior year swan song for USTA Indoor National Champion Maria Sanchez, who tries to lead the No. 19 Women of Troy tennis team back atop the hard court hierarchy for the second time in three seasons.
It’s not every day a university puts as much emphasis on gender equality in athletics, let alone has the talent across the board to maintain such a level of equality.
So from me to you, have a happy and healthy new year, may your spirits be brightened, may your baseball team return to its once-routine post as a Pac-10 powerhouse and may your athletic program be spotless on and off the field in the year to come.

Despite failing to meet expectations a season ago, the No. 1 ranked Trojans begin 2011 atop the American Volleyball Coaches Association Division I-II poll for the second consecutive year. The team has also been voted by the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation’s coaches as the co-favorite to win the conference.
Star power · Senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy is considered  by many to be a serious candidate for National Player of the Year. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“It’s nice that people think of us that way, but we’re concerned with the process of getting there at the end of the year,” USC coach Bill Ferguson told USCTrojans.com.
USC has a plethora of talent, returning five out of six starters from last season, when they finished with a No. 7 national ranking but just sixth in MPSF play.
The 2011 squad is led by the senior co-captain duo, composed of senior setter Riley McKibbin and senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy.
The explosive and cannon-armed Troy will return for his fourth season as USC’s starting opposite hitter. The perennial All-American has amassed 1,526 kills and 105 aces, putting him on track to break the USC career records in both categories.
Troy will also be a preseason contender for National Player of the Year recognition.
The heady McKibbin will return for his third season as the Trojans starting setter. Last year, he led the team with 1,384 assists and 235 digs. McKibbin is also an All-American candidate.
“The seniors have been great leaders this year and keeping guys focused on what’s really important,” Ferguson said. “We’ve been through this [before], so they understand what it takes.”
To open the season, the Trojans started off strong in a sweep over Alberta, Canada’s No. 2 ranked squad. Junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli led the team with 12 kills and six digs, while Troy added 11 kills.
Though the Trojans swept Cal State Northridge in a pre-season match, Ferguson knows this game won’t be easy.
“They’re a no-frills team, blue collar team that really works their tails off,” Ferguson said.
The Matadors also come into the night with a reputation as one of the nation’s strongest serving teams.
Still, Ferguson stressed that the team’s focus is on what they can control.
“We need to focus on our side of the net and execute,” Ferguson said. “If we play solid defense, set up a strong block, serve well, side out and execute our gameplan, things will be very good for us.”
First serve will be at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

An expletive engraved in limestone, four words long: “F*** you, Lane Kiffin.”
It embodied frustration, of course.
On Dec. 1, 2008, University of Tennessee football fans watched a boyish-looking Kiffin shake hands with athletic director Mike Hamilton at a press conference introducing the 33-year-old as the Volunteers’ 21st head coach, replacing the successful yet often-maligned Phillip Fulmer. 
Kiffin, renowned for his offensive playcalling abilities and aptitude for recruiting as an assistant under Pete Carroll at USC from 2001-2006, stood at a podium within the bowels of the then 102,000-seat Neyland Stadium and spoke with  unwavering conviction.
“I’m really looking forward to embracing some of the great traditions at the University of Tennessee,” Kiffin told onlookers. “The Vol Walk, running through the T, singing Rocky Top all night long next year after we beat Florida. It’s going to be a blast, so get ready.”
A native Midwesterner, originally hailing from Minnesota, who attended college at Fresno State, Kiffin sounded like a Tennessee man, despite his not-so-Southern roots. He talked about a strong worth ethic, leadership and even loyalty. He discussed recruiting local talent, winning national championships and besting the program’s Southeastern Conference nemeses Florida and Georgia.
Most of all, he made one thing rather clear: was proud to be the school’s headman after spending a good part of a decade on the West Coast.
“As I looked at the opportunities available, there was nothing close to this,” Kiffin said of the Volunteers program at the time.
Not long after, though, he hummed a slightly different tune, bolting for USC seemingly in the middle of the night one year ago today — Jan. 12, 2010.
“I’m at the best place in America,” Kiffin said when asked about his decision to return to Southern California. “This is a dream job for me. This is somewhere that I was at for six years. This is a place that was very special to me for a long time.”
“The Rock,” as it is known by most, sits at the corner of Volunteer Boulevard and Pat Head Summitt Street, near the south end of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville campus.
Composed of 500-million-year-old Knox dolomite, in most cases the giant boulder would remain obsolete, a minor detail for passersby. Instead, over time, its foundation has assumed the role of a campus message board, the pulse for a lively student population 30,000 strong.
Self expression, as a result, is rooted in The Rock. During the course of past decades, students have painted birthday greetings, marriage proposals and a myriad of other sayings across the iconic stone.
“For generations, the Rock has been an unofficial message board for our campus,” university chancellor Jimmy G. Cheek said in a July 2009 statement. “It’s a UT Knoxville icon.”
Football, which remains woven into the fabric of the Southern lifestyle, has intersected with The Rock on a multitude of occasions.
Following a football victory over the University of Florida in the late 1990s, a handful of students discovered Gators coach Steve Spurrier’s home phone number and quickly painted the digits on The Rock in the aftermath of the contest before security eventually took action.
Kiffin, much like Spurrier before him, has also been the subject of a few choice words engraved on The Rock, largely on Jan. 12.
At that moment, The Rock, which had been doused with paint, featured multiple obscenities directed at Kiffin, while simultaneously serving as the focal point of a campus riot in the wake of the coach’s decision to depart for USC.
In the minutes following Kiffin’s sudden announcement, students gathered at The Rock, which had already been tagged with  the address of the coach’s Knoxville area home and his wife’s cell phone number.
Hundreds of UT students then took to the streets, gathering on Johnny Majors Boulevard and blocking the road as a result, with the hope of preventing Kiffin from leaving the parking lot. It was evident, though, that Kiffin was not present on campus at the time.
“We just really wanted to see Lane Kiffin and let him know how we feel,” UT student Zach Griesler told WBIR-TV in Knoxville at the time of the announcement. “We wanted to let him know this decision affects people and how betrayed we feel.”
Continuing the onslaught, there were signs of order breaking down, with a student lighting a mattress on fire and several others burning University of Tennessee-related apparel, particularly T-shirts paying homage to Kiffin.
Police and firefighters, as a result, were called to the scene in an effort to bring calm to the situation, where the mattress and other burnings were extinguished.
“I think the students have had kind of a violent reaction to that and a lot of them are disheartened, upset and feel betrayed that less than a year in that he would be leaving and taking off,” Knoxville Fire Department Captain D.J. Corcoran told reporters in the aftermath.
“Lane Kiffin is about as faithful as Tiger Woods,” said Erin Exum, a then-senior majoring in sports broadcasting, in an article published on ESPN.com. “The worst part of all this is Kiffin’s broken promises. We felt like Kiffin would fight for us and as loyal students we took his side. We believed in him.”
A year later, both Tennessee and USC have looked to “move forward” in separate ways. After losing Kiffin, Hamilton hired Louisiana Tech coach Derek Dooley to revitalize a program that had seen three coaches in three seasons. Despite a 6-7 overall mark, Dooley led the Volunteers to four wins in the team’s final five games.
In spite of NCAA-levied sanctions, USC athletic director Pat Haden has appeared relatively pleased with the effort put forth by Kiffin and his coaching staff in their first year with the Trojans despite a mere 8-5 record, the most losses in a single season since 2001.
“I think Lane has been sensational,” Haden said. “He’s done a great job. I think Lane’s going to be here for a very long time.”
From his vantage point, Kiffin hopes Haden’s assertion is accurate.
“For me, it’s the best job,” he said at Pac-10 Media Day last July, one of his first gatherings with the national press. “I say that because I was here before and it was so special being here and having our kids all born out here. It is very special to us. So the ability to come back here, even with the stuff that’s happened, it is still, to me, the best job in America.”
nah, mistake
Time will tell as far as Haden’s assessment of Kiffin. Look at the bright side. Before this year, Lane Kiffin’s best record as a head coach was 7-6. He has improved to 8-5 in his first year at USC, a new benchmark. How a coach with his record can land a job at USC for 4 million a year should be an inspiration to every losing coach in the country. If Pat Haden is wrong about Lane Kiffin, I hope he will have the integrity to admit it and make the necessary decisions to correct this mistake.
Also on the bright side are wins against Cal and U Can’t Learn Anything. Seriously, the team is full of talent. The potential for success is there, and Lane Kiffin just might be the coach to develop it.
8-5 is not terrible for a first year head coach working under sanctions, etc.

The latest film from director Giorgos Lanthimos concerns a pair of unnamed, affluent parents (Christos Stergioglou and Michele Valley) whose take on raising children involves physically, intellectually and emotionally confining their offspring to the lush grounds of a gated home. Filmed almost entirely within the tropical estate, the picture might as well be set on Neptune — reason and compassion are as vacant in the film as oxygen in the cosmos.
Strange sights · Aggeliki Papoulia gives a glimpse of the chilling domestic life created by her domineering father and the restricting location the characters find themselves in. -  Photo Courtesy of Kino International 
Indoctrinated with the belief that man-eating cats lurk on the other side of the wall, the three grown siblings (Aggeliki Papoulia, Mary Tsoni and Hristos Passalis) pass the time with contests of physical endurance in the backyard and swimming pool. The father also provides an understandably catatonic security guard (Anna Kalaitzidou) from his factory to have sex with his son once a week. The two daughters, however, are allowed no such outlet for their desires.
Allegorically, Lanthimos is treading the same social territory as Pier Paolo Pasolini did in Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom. Those with weak stomachs will be relieved to hear that Lanthimos spares us the banquet of feces and circle of mutilation that propelled Pasolini’s picture into the clouds of cinematic infamy. Still, the political implications of Dogtooth retain some urgency while also wearing a face of obsidian humor.
Much credit is owed to Stergioglou’s almost impossibly straight-faced performance as the father. Heavy on blubber, with a permanent pooch-like glare, Stergioglou’s portrayal of the father is at once nauseating and arresting. Lanthimos dares us to laugh when the father teaches the entire family to ward off the fabled cats by loudly barking or nearly bashes one daughter’s head in with the television remote as punishment. But both acts are too unnervingly real to be found humorous.
The children are just as effective in their constantly frozen  state. All three have unusual ways of resolving quarrels, including a butcher knife on bare skin, but Lanthimos never allows us to forget the origin of their perverse definitions of discourse and discipline.
The wink of recognizance one tends to expect from players in such a willfully unpleasant picture never comes, evoking not only bewilderment but also empathy.
These young actors are fearless in their portrayal of naked sexuality, conducted here with the warmth and passion of a circumcision. By putting the parts of his actors on clinical display, Lanthimos manages to dehumanize the body and its needs more than any director in recent memory. Even David Cronenberg, the arguable master of venereal discomfort, is outdone here.
To what end Lanthimos and his cast have pushed the envelope of popular comfort and taste depends on one’s familiarity with current events. At its basest layer, Dogtooth is a vicious satire on the modern plutocracy. Without a doubt, mother and father have mastered their brood and castle, but at the same time sapped any vibrancy — a fact made grimly plain by Thimios Bakatakis’s stark cinematography.
Such complete control might seem outlandish to those who haven’t had the pleasure of visiting Guantanamo Bay or Josef Fritzl’s basement. Whether personal or political, existential captivity remains a modern instrument of domination and, in this film’s case, self-gratification. We get the sense that the father, in his own youth, would have enjoyed regular visits from a female security guard and has merely bequeathed his son one of many gifts by caging him for his entire life, tossing the occasional treat between the bars.
Therein lies the film’s most ghastly idea. Others, including Pasolini, have explored human subjugation powerfully, but Lanthimos goes one step further, suggesting that the world may collectively desire such predetermined authority. The film’s release in the midst of the Wikileaks scandal forces us to ask whether we are invigorated or incapacitated by the notion of freedom through transparency.
As the whole clan nervously approaches the estate entrance in a pivotal scene, fearfully barking out at those imaginary cats lurking in the dark, the film finally becomes a scream of desperation, smartly silenced until this moment.
Whether this is our future or our fantasy, Lanthimos is unwilling to decide. Such affirmation lies in the minds of the viewers — those willing enough to watch this savage, uncompromising work of horror.

You know the turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, wine, champagne, pumpkin pie, apple strudel, chips, guacamole, sour cream and bread were worth it.
Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Those extra five or six pounds you might have packed on this holiday season can easily be undone with dedication and a few tips.
You are What You Eat
To start, put down the butter.
Remember these two key phrases for getting back into shape: reasonable amounts of food, reasonable amounts of activity. Bottom line: listen to your body, jump on the treadmill, eat what you need to eat and fuel yourself.
Stop with the “no carbs” bogus and try not to get unnecessarily overwhelmed and spend five hours a day at the gym.
This is not only a big waste of time, it’s unhealthy.
There are many conflicting ideas about what is most important when you want to lose weight, be it nutrition or exercise. Both are equally important.
You may want to start out by making a meal plan. Breakfast at 10 a.m. At 12 p.m. or later, have a nice snack like an apple and a handful of nuts. Have lunch at  2 p.m. — maybe a salad with some protein like meat (or tofu for all you vegetarians out there). If you didn’t have a snack earlier in the day, go ahead and have one around 3 or 4 p.m. Make  your dinner a big one that includes protein, veggies and a small starch like brown rice or whole wheat pasta.
It’s college; bedtime is 3 a.m. Have your last snack, peanut butter and apple or crackers, at around 12 a.m. and then call it a night. Start over the next day.
The hard part may be neglecting your sweet tooth that creeps up on you at the worst of times. Try to limit indulgences to three times a week, as long as you are trying to fit back into that little black dress.
Working It
Now that you have a meal plan, build your work-out schedule. If you’re really eager, five days a week is fine. Try not to make it more than that, because your muscles need to rest and adjust to the increased activity.
Face your treadmill fear. Running works out your back, butt, arms, abs and obviously legs. Alternatives are the stair-master or elliptical.
There are also many interactive exercise options out there for those bored with the familiar resistance machines. The Lyon Center offers spinning and zumba classes, and there are many nearby boxing studios around campus if you have transportation. For the more ambitious crowd, consider another method of weight loss that has been used by celebrities all over Hollywood called The Bar Method.
The Bar Method is an extremely intensive workout that combines yoga, Pilates and core training that will make your legs shake harder than ever before, leaving you unable to walk for days.
This intensive workout focuses on cutting the fat and developing lean, sexy muscles by using sharp, repetitive pulsing with light weights. While running is the best form of exercise, some people complain that it builds bulky muscles, and The Bar Method can prevent that.
As you sit in a chair, pose with a bouncy ball between your legs for one minute and thirty seconds and remember that the end justifies the means.
Finally, other than cardio, spend your off days doing resistance training with weights.
Men, you don’t need to bench press 15,000 pound weights and ladies, you can do more than three pounders. The most important thing to remember about resistance training is to use the weights to increase your own resistance.
Depending on how much mass you want to lose or gain, give yourself a few weeks and most important of all, have faith.
With time, your bod will be back in action.
I have tried to lose weight dozens of times. “Hypersonic Weight Loss” really works, I even went on a cruise and came back 2 pounds lighter.

Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard once whined, “So this is the new year / and I don’t feel any different.”
Thankfully, in 2010, things were different from the year before. Sobby emo music like Death Cab was no longer popular, and Kanye West pushed the creative boundaries of contemporary music. Now that it’s 2011, it’s time for the music world to change yet again.
There are several albums to look forward to this year, but also an exciting unpredictability as to what music will offer in the next 12 months. Here are several music trends I’m looking forward to in 2011 — and some I’m not so excited about.
The Good
Electronic Music
Ravers have been dressing up in neon and dancing to original techno DJs, such as Moby, for about 20 years, but the current electronic music scene is arguably the sound of our generation. The London dubstep movement that’s so rapidly sweeping the United States is unlike anything in music history, and house music continues to evolve. Hopefully, innovative artists like Skrillex and Flying Lotus will push the genre further in the new year.
Music Videos
Who cares that MTV doesn’t play music videos anymore? Jersey Shore is more entertaining. It’s interesting to note, though, that despite the decline of the popular music video channel and the numerous technological changes and advancements in recent years, people are still watching music videos. And they’re getting better.
Lady Gaga’s Quentin Tarantino-inspired videos, M.I.A.’s ginger genocide video and Kanye’s 35-minute short film/album teaser captured the attention of hundreds of thousands of music fans in 2010 (regardless of the collective video quality, which is debatable).
Ideally, 2011’s music videos will be more accessible, prevalent and better.
Lil Wayne, Kanye and Jay-Z
For much of 2010, Weezy was locked up in Rikers Island for a gun possession charge and the world was deprived of his scratchy, scatterbrained flow. He’s  now out and better than ever. Wayne’s newest single, “6’7,’” contains clever lines like “Real ‘G’s move in silence like lasagna / people say I’m borderline crazy, sorta kinda.” The rapper is set to drop his hotly anticipated Tha Carter IV sometime this year.
While Weezy was detoxing behind bars, Yeezy was very much free. Kanye West spent the year recovering from the infamous Taylor Swift incident at the 2009 Video Music Awards, and succeeded by releasing one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2010.
In the upcoming months, West is set to release a joint record with his “big brother,” Jay-Z. The album, Watch the Throne, should prove an excellent hip-hop collaborative effort.
The Bad
Electronic music
Yes, electronic music is also on the “looking forward to” list, but the genre as a whole is not always enjoyable.
If you live anywhere near the Shrine Auditorium, your windows have likely been rattled all hours of the night by the pounding bass of the many raves staged there. Most popular electronic tracks lack lyrics or include only a senseless hook about partying and dancing.
There’s nothing wrong with party music, but it doesn’t have the same impact as socially relevant or emotionally relatable songs.
Sam Adams
The beer and its many delicious flavors can stay, but the terrible rapper of the same name needs to go.
I’m usually not a fan of putting down artists, but it’s hard to respect this guy. He ruined a perfectly good song with his remix of Rusko’s “Hold On”, and failed to realize that taking the beat from Asher Roth’s “I Love College,” the rapper’s popular song about loving college for the parties, renaming it “I Hate College” and then rapping “but I love all the drinking,” is hardly clever.
Hopefully this hip-hop artist  can either step his game up in 2011 or fade away.
The Grammys
If I hear the words, “And the album of the year goes to … Katy Perry!” during the Grammys broadcast this year, I will throw my shoe at the TV and then drink — Sam Adams, until I end up “Waking Up in Vegas.”
I can only hope that Kanye would be presenting the award and pull another  Taylor Swift incident, part 2: “Yo Katy, you’re hot, but Eminem/The Arcade Fire had the best albums of the year.”
It’s always annoying when some wrinkly old guy wins for an album nobody’s listened to, as Herbie Hancock did in 2008. But Katy Perry with album of the year?
Nominations like that, for music’s most esteemed award, nonetheless, make me lose hope for popular music.

 Thanks Will Hagle
Superb article!  This fine young man appears to roll in the same circle as others I have enjoyed reading.  I’m looking forward to next week’s critique.   fondly, Karen

Wurstküche is not an easy place to find.
You have to meander through several streets, combing through dilapidated wholesale markets, odd plush toy stores and austere Buddhist temples before you take a sudden sharp turn into Third Street at Traction in downtown Los Angeles. And there you are: standing in front of a dark, glass door sandwiched between two brightly painted yellow and crimson wooden planks.
Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
The sudden splash of gaudy colors clashes glaringly with the rest of the backdrop, and appears to belong more at a circus than a street in downtown Los Angeles.
The strange juxtaposition instills a sensation of wonder. If you were just a casual passerby, you would have thought you had discovered something mysterious and fantastic.
Perhaps that was the intention of 29-year-old Joseph Pitruzzelli, co-owner and designer of the umlaut beer and sausage restaurant, Wurstküche.
“It’s part of a unique experience for people when they come down here and feel like they’ve discovered something,” Pitruzzelli said. “[Wurstküche] is like an unmarked territory that they’re entering, and they feel like they found a special club.”
Wurstküche (pronounced “Vursh-kee-hyah”) is German for “Sausage Kitchen,” and that is essentially what Pitruzzelli and fellow owner Tyler Wilson focus on. With a fixed menu of 21 sausages ranging from classic bratwursts to fancy apricot and ginger sausages to the downright outrageous rattlesnake and rabbit links, Wurstküche is all about the sausages, and the Belgian and German beers to wash them down.
Pitruzzelli, who is of German and Italian descent, has always had an affinity for sausages. He grew up eating countless Italian-style sausages and, while studying at the University of San Francisco, cooking sausages on his George Foreman grill was his idea of a gourmet meal in his dorm room.
While other students wolfed down take-out and dining hall grub, Pitruzzelli was hunting for gourmet sausages to satisfy his appetite for good food.
After graduation, Pitruzzelli stayed in San Francisco designing nightclubs through his own design firm. Meanwhile, Wilson, his cousin, was a sophomore at USC.
Both cousins shared an interest in business and entrepreneurship and Wilson pitched the idea of opening a place together in downtown Los Angeles.
“I could feel the bloodstream of a vibrant youth here, a contrast to what I saw at San Francisco, which was a bit more stagnant,” Pitruzzelli said. “It was inspiring for me to be here.”
Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Pitruzzelli moved in with Wilson at USC’s campus. After scrounging around downtown Los Angeles, the cousins finally nailed a location in the Art District: a three-story, abandoned Victorian house, formerly one of Los Angeles’ first brothels.
Constructing the interior was delegated to Pitruzzelli, who has nine years of experience in nightclub design.
“We didn’t want a clichéd building of post-modernism coldness,” Pitruzelli said. “We didn’t want any distractions like televisions. We want people to come here to be with friends, meet new friends and have social interactions.”
This vision translated into warm wooden benches, long communal tables, quirky barstools and rustic brick walls. An angular, dim hallway snakes from the service counter to the grand dining room, where you pick up your Dunkelweizen on draft from the bar, chase it with a freshly grilled sausage and exchange toasts with fellow customers.
Despite the limited menu and emphasis on alcoholic drinks, Wurstküche started drawing a fascinating medley of customers.
“The wide gamut of people we attract is unbelievable and unrivaled,” Pitruzelli said.
Hipsters can be seen grooving next to the lawyers, clinking glasses next to businessmen. On the other end of the table, judges and jurors lunch after a trial.
Pitruzzelli said that once, he even saw a group of 5-year-old Korean kids having a birthday party.
The central attraction, though, is the sausage bar.
Pitruzzelli and Wilson sampled about 800 different sausages before selecting just 21 for their final menu.
Pitruzzelli knew from the beginning that he wanted rattlesnake meat in one of the sausages, which led to the famous rattlesnake and rabbit sausage with jalapeno peppers (warning: It does not taste like chicken).
The perfect sausage, he said, must be moist and still juicy inside when you bite into it.
Wurstküche’s sausages pass the test. Business has prospered so much since its November 2008 opening that a second Wurstküche is already planned for Venice.
“I was totally surprised by our success,” Pitruzzelli said. “We didn’t even do much social media marketing.”
Instead, their media strategy was to rely mostly on word-of-mouth. The only real marketing the cousins did was placing a sign outside their restaurant four months before they opened, confident of Los Angeles’ sharp nose for good grub. Indeed, Wurstküche quickly garnered much attention from media outfits and bloggers.
“I’ve even had people from Japan send us homemade movies on their experience at Wurstküche,” Pitruzelli said. “I love that we can inspire people like that.”
“the cousins finally nailed a location in the Art District: a three-story, abandoned Victorian house, formerly one of Los Angeles’ first brothels”-good food, beer, and sex make an excellenet combo.

Facebook layout changes often make for popular status updates. Yet, although the changes we’ve seen this past year have been tumultuous, the small layout changes are incomparable to the biggest change the company enacted during 2010: Facebook now owns everything a user publishes. Once again, Facebook users are paying attention to the wrong changes.
While most users were  passively annoyed with changes to a well-working model, some were more outspoken with their dissatisfation (“Is this Facebook for ants? How am I supposed to read status updates when the text is a full point smaller?”)
Negative responses to new font sizes, differing “wall” styles and modifications to the way others view your recent activity pale in comparison to the outrage over the new Facebook layout, which proudly displays a user’s five most recently tagged pictures — usually not the most flattering — and contains a small, self-promoting blurb on top of status updates.
As users were acclimating to these changes, though, they inadvertently let one huge change slip by.
While users were arguing about the minute details of Facebook’s changes, the website quietly made one change that has slipped past its users without much disagreement.
If you’re like me, when there are 18 amendments under the “Statement of Rights and Responsibilities,” you just click “I accept” and go with the odds that you didn’t just give away your first-born child.
Let me summarize clause No. 7 of Facebook’s new privacy policy: By using Facebook, each user agrees that regardless  of whether that drunk party picture is removed,  that immature status update passive aggressively dedicated to an ex-boyfriend is hidden or the account is deleted altogether, Facebook owns everything published — forever.
So that ever-present “Did anyone just feel that earthquake?” status belongs eternally to Mark Zuckerberg.  Zuckerberg also owns that note posted during finals week when you were avoiding studying for organic chemistry and revealed a little more than you intended. That note is saved, even when you hit the “x” button and have moved onto a more “mature” junior year.
I didn’t see very many statuses that said: “Did anyone read the new privacy policies? In clause No. 7 it said this status now belongs to Facebook Inc.”
But more important than font changes and layout rearrangements is the fact that every embarrassing picture vomiting by the toilet or quoting mainstream song lyrics as if you’d thought of it are now the intellectual property of Zuckerberg.
I guess users were right in resisting change, just not in the way we thought.

I hope you quickly respond by providing documentation for this piece. I have so far found no evidence supporting your position and hope you will be able to provide it. It is especially important because this piece has been distributed by UWire across the country to other student newspapers.
Can you please provide a link to the document that contains this information?  Thank you.
thanks for writing this article.  i have avoided facebook like the plague from the start, trying to get others to be very careful with their comments, etc.  now there is even more evidence that facebook is to avoided unless one is willing to suffer negative consequences, known and unknown, present and future….

The New START Treaty, which limits the amount of strategic nuclear weapons that both the United States and Russia are allowed to have deployed at any time, was approved by the U.S. Senate in late December, overcoming its last hurdle.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The treaty fostered a contentious   debate in Washington, but in the end, the treaty rightfully received 71 of 97 votes in the Senate, marking an important political victory for the Obama administration.
Opponents fear the treaty will ultimately prevent the United States from building strategic missile defense systems in Europe, and have argued that there wasn’t enough time to resolve this issue.
“When majority leader Harry Reid, [D-N.V.] asked me if I thought the treaty could be considered in the lame-duck session, I replied I did not think so given the combination of other work Congress must do and the complex and unresolved issues related to New Start and modernization,” said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-A.Z., in a written statement Nov. 16.
The next day, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-I.N., ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, spoke passionately against the idea of avoiding a vote during the lame-duck session.
“Every senator has an obligation in the national security interest to take a stand, to do his or her duty,” he told reporters in November.
Lugar was right to push for a vote, as the treaty is effective for the United States and its allies for multiple reasons.
To start, the treaty symbolically and diplomatically strengthens the relationship between the United States and Russia.
The Russian Federation still has important political, economic and military influence around the globe. Russian aggression to the current framework of the international system could also have a greater impact as the reach of U.S. foreign policy diminishes.
In the second decade of the 21st century, Russia’s international role will be significantly defined by its coalescence or its divergence with the United States and its allies. New START should allow the former enemies to work together on certain security issues, such as Iran.
The treaty also ensures that all United States and Russian nuclear materials are accounted for and under safeguards because it re-establishes continued on-site inspections and verification procedures of each sides’  nuclear facilities.
Inspections allow each side to be   fully aware of their counterpart’s nuclear arsenal, while also providing greater assurance that all nuclear materials are accounted for.
New START will rightfully be implemented from the get-go. During his press conference Dec. 22, President Obama announced that U.S. inspectors would be back on the ground at Russian nuclear bases with the passing of the treaty.
The treaty sets the precedent that the reduction of nuclear stockpiles is a practical and realistic goal.
The international non-proliferation regime led by the International Atomic Energy Agency has moved slowly in implementing lasting changes beyond establishing a norm against the development and use of nuclear weapons. But reductions from the most powerful can lessen both the international threat level and a non-nuclear weapons state’s desire to proliferate.
“The [New] START Treaty is an important message to non-nuclear weapon states that the world’s two nuclear super powers are ‘working on it,’” Dr. Wayne Glass of USC’s School of International Relations noted in a   written statement.
The treaty demonstrates how the United States can effectively dictate the international system to benefit the majority of the actors.
At the end of the Cold War, the United States assumed the international role of global moderator. Balancing its own self-interest and attempting to protect foreign citizens, the country has asserted itself militarily, exerting an unprecedented level of power around the globe.
The United States’ current economic struggles promise a much more diminished and restrained U.S. foreign policy. In the future, the United States will rely on others to help moderate the international system.
New START reflects this change. The Obama administration, along with the U.S. Senate, has acknowledged the need to strengthen global relationships.
Though New START is a step forward in the right direction, the United States must continue to extend its diplomatic hand to all potential allies in the interest of our security in the 21st century.

Shortly after 11 a.m. Monday morning, a 58-year-old male suspect dressed as a deliveryman entered Alpha Rho Chi fraternity through an unlocked window and stole a fraternity member’s laptop while she was in the shower.
Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said a member of the co-ed fraternity called DPS as soon as she noticed her computer was missing, which allowed DPS officers to come to the scene quickly.
“One of our officers responded and happened to get there as the burglar was coming out the front door,” Carlisle said.
When the officer tried to detain the suspect, he ran a short distance before mounting a bicycle. After setting up a perimeter around the neighborhood officers from both DPS and the Los Angeles Police Department surrounded and caught the suspect near the AAA Automobile Club on Figueroa.
After being identified by the victim, the suspect was arrested and booked at LAPD. The suspect, who had previously been arrested for other burglaries, had broken his parole, Carlisle said.
“We are very glad he is caught,” Carlisle said. “He is a parolee at large, so he was wanted.”
Carlisle said this burglary might have been difficult to prevent, particularly in such a large residence.
“Usually, most burglaries won’t go in a residence if they think someone is home,” he said. “They will usually use some ruse to find out if someone is home before breaking in.”
Alpha Rho Chi President Augustine Liu said he was surprised by the nature of the crime.
“It was a pretty absurd incident,” he said. “I know there have been people in the past who have walked up to the fraternity saying they are from sister or brother fraternities, and we usually turn them away, so this was a little bit of an anomaly.”
Carlisle advised students to lock windows and doors, especially those on lower levels, and said calling DPS at the first sight of a problem is the best way to assist in preventing crime.
“The resident did the right thing by calling DPS as soon as she noticed something was wrong,” Carlisle said.
co-ed fraternity…co-ed. male and female. got it?
Then a specification of a co-ed fraternity is necessary. As written it is still incorrect. Got it?
Glad to see Daily Trojan has acknowledged and corrected the mistake.
“…fraternity member’s laptop while she was in the shower.”
SERIOUSLY, Lily/DT? A woman (she) cannot be a member of a fraternity. Please try and make it past the first sentence without a blatant grammatical error. Simply unacceptable.

USC is currently involved in negotiations to buy state-owned property in Exposition Park, which includes the land under the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena and five surrounding parking lots.
Selling game · Spectators fill the Coliseum on game day. USC is in the process of buying the Coliseum from the state. The property has been owned by the state since 1921 and the Coliseum Commission has a lease that extends to 2054. - Daily Trojan file photo 
The Coliseum and Sports Arena are currently jointly owned by the state of California, Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which has board members from each of the three ownership interests, manages the facilities according to a lease with the state.
The state approached USC with a proposal for a sale and talks began in early December, with the state initially offering to sell the property it has owned since 1921 for $54 million.
California’s current budget problems provided the impetus for the governor’s office to contact the university with the proposed sale, said Kristina Raspe, the university’s associate senior vice president of real estate and asset management.
“We’re proposing to buy the land from the state of California, and we would buy the land subject to the existing leases,” Raspe said. “The Coliseum Commission has a lease that goes through 2054, so nothing would change with regard to the operation of the Coliseum on a day-to-day basis.”
Raspe said she expected a deal to be reached by the end of December, but the negotiation process was extended when the Board of Directors for Exposition Park and the California Science Center decided on Dec. 22 to continue studying all aspects of the offer before approving the sale.
Los Angeles City Council members Bernard Parks, Jan Perry and Ed Reyes had contacted the Board to request that there be “adequate community outreach and discussion” before a sale was approved, according to the Daily News.
Councilman Parks, who is also a member of the Coliseum Commission, expressed concern about land in a public park being sold to a private entity such as USC.
“Rather than go and make a decision about a sale, they should create the prospect of a designated buyer while having the process done in a public setting so that everybody knows the ramifications of what they’re talking about,” Parks said. “The public needs to know what it’s going to mean to have a public park go into private hands.”
Parks said he stressed the importance of communication in the sale because there are too many questions surrounding technicalities of the sale that even members of the Coliseum Commission don’t know the answers to.
Negotiations are likely to take at least two to three months, Raspe said, and any deal will have to be approved by newly inaugurated Gov. Jerry Brown.
The Coliseum Commission would still be in charge of any maintenance, improvements and leasing opportunities for the stadium, and USC would pay rent for six days a year for each home football game.
Because of the Coliseum’s status as a national historic landmark, a complete redevelopment of the property is unlikely. The stadium will continue to benefit from improvements, but its landmark status restricts what can be done with the land.
The Sports Arena, though, is already the subject of redevelopment plans. According to the Coliseum Commission, the current arena is underutilized and in need of several structural upgrades.
Two months ago, the commission submitted an environmental impact report for circulation that outlines redevelopment of the property into either a Major League Soccer stadium or an open-air amphitheater and multiple-use space.
Raspe said USC is supportive of the Coliseum Commission’s plans for redevelopment of the Sports Arena and, in the event of a successful purchase of the property, would have input in the process of redevelopment.
Raspe said that despite the long negotiations ahead, the university is optimistic about the potential sale.
“It’s a nice way to preserve all the properties in the park while allowing the university to upgrade them,” she said. “People seem to be positive, but there’s a long way to go before we have a deal.”
The Coliseum Commission’s lease on the structures would remain in place even if USC were to buy the property on which they are built. It would continue to operate the Coliseum and Sports Arena while the university would act as the landlord of the commission.
Parks questioned exactly how such a relationship between the commission and the university would work in the event of a sale, especially since the university would then be “both a landlord and a tenant.”
The parking lots would still have to be available for the museums and events at the Coliseum and Sports Arena, but they would provide additional overflow parking for the university, should it be necessary, Raspe said.
I have fond memories of the LA Sports Arena as a concert venue. I’ll be interested in seeing what will ultimately be its fate.
Sweet baby jesus! An MLS stadium would be incredible in place of the sports arena.

Beginning next fall semester, classes will no longer be held the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.
Season of plenty · Students serve themselves at the Thanksgiving Dinner held by President Nikias. The Thanksgiving holiday for USC students has been extended to include the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan 
In a survey conducted by the Undergraduate Student Government last year, 93.2 percent of students interviewed said they supported having an extra day for Thanksgiving break. USG had been lobbying for this additional day for more than two years, according to Maya Babla, USG chief of staff.
The number of class days during the fall semester will now be shortened from 72 to 71 instructional days, and the university will not hold another day of classes to make up for it.
“With the extra day, students will have more freedom to travel for Thanksgiving, particularly the out-of-state students,” said Kenneth Servis, dean of Academic Records and Registrar. “I do not think that there will be severe consequences for extending the break.”
USG President Chris Cheng said adding an extra day to Thanksgiving break has been a top priority for USG.
“USG is extremely excited about this development. It is something we’ve been working very hard on and it is motivating to see such a great result,” Cheng said.
Kara Ludke, a freshman from Michigan majoring in theatre, said the extra day is beneficial for out-of-state students like her who have to spend more time traveling for the holidays.
“Having classes that day just wasn’t fair for out-of-state students, because if they went to class like they were supposed to, they would most likely spend all Thursday, the actual holiday of Thanksgiving, traveling,” she said.
Some students, though, said the extra day will not make a difference.
“That means we still don’t have a full break,” said Charlotte Chan, a junior majoring in environmental engineering. “Now I will just want to skip both Monday and Tuesday and be home for the whole week.”
Cheng said the decision ultimately came from the Academic Calendar Committee’s recommendation to the Provost, whose support helped pass the measure.
Ravi Agarwal, USG director of Academic Affairs, had also been working on the issue by lobbying the Board of Trustees’ Academic Affairs Committee for its support. Presentations were given to the board showing student survey results and research on comparable institutions.
Even though all the support and research for the idea was presented last year, the Academic Calendar Committee only meets every three years, Agarwal explained in an e-mail. Their last meeting took place before winter break, allowing the initiative to officially pass in December.
Cheng emphasized that the university’s diverse community was a major factor in determining the extended break.
“USC is no longer just a regional university and with students from all over the country and world, it is appropriate that the university adjust its policy to support its students,” Cheng said.

It started with the top recruiting class in the country. It ended with an impressive run but, ultimately, a difficult loss in the Final Four.
Strong finish · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the Women of Troy to a Final Four berth in December. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team had beaten California twice during the year in Pac-10 play. But winning a third time proved to be too great a feat for the Women of Troy, as the Golden Bears swept USC 25-14, 25-17, 25-20.
“It’s so disappointing to lose to a team like that at the end, especially after beating them twice during the season,” said junior middle blocker Lauren Williams.
The Women of Troy (29-5, 14-4) were plagued by a slow start due to rotation and net violations, and dug themselves in a hole they could never recover from.
“We couldn’t get our defense to adjust to what we had done the first two times with them,” said USC coach Mick Haley, “so I think that we were mentally tired.”
In the preceding match, the Women of Troy found themselves against another familiar opponent, the Stanford Cardinal — the only team to beat USC twice during the regular season.
“In both of the Stanford matches, for some reason, I didn’t feel like we had a very good effort,” Haley said.
Fortunately, the third time around, it was the Women of Troy that were able to come out on top.
“We changed our systems a little bit to try to accommodate what they did, and at that point in the season they weren’t fittingly able to adjust to what we were doing, so it worked out quite well,” Haley said.
USC had defeated New Mexico and San Diego in opening round matches at the Galen Center. The Women of Troy then went on to sweep Indiana in the regional semifinal.
USC’s No. 6 seed would not have been possible without strong performances during conference play. Entering the Final Four, the Women of Troy had won nine straight and 15 out of 16 matches.
Haley considered the start of the second half of Pac-10 play to be the big turning point for his team.
USC entered the second half of the conference season with a 6-3 record after losing to Stanford, Washington and Arizona State.
But the Women of Troy were nearly flawless the rest of the way, losing only to Stanford and finishing in third place in the conference.
One major reason for the team’s success was the large number of newcomers, which could have originally been seen as a hindrance. USC boasted six freshmen and a redshirt sophomore, who became eligible midway through the season.
“You can’t measure how important it was for the freshmen to get all the way to the Final Four,”  Haley said. “They have a vision now of how it works and what they want to do every time.”
One of these freshmen, outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, was named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. She also earned All-Pac-10 Honors in her debut season. Joining her were outside hitter Alex Jupiter and middle blocker Lauren Williams. Setter Kendall Bateman earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention.
Later in the year, Jupiter, Williams and Bateman were named All-Americans. Two-time All-American Jupiter was granted first team honors, while Bateman was named to the second team and Williams to the third.
But even with all these victories and awards, the Women of Troy are nowhere near ready to settle.
“Our expectations are national championships. That’s what we want,” Haley said. “I think we have a plan for the next 12 months culminating in getting to the Final Four and this time winning.”
The players hope to duplicate last year’s success as well, but hope to take it one step further.
“It’s my last year. I want a championship,” Williams declared about her upcoming final season.

Junior guard Briana Gilbreath attempted a shot and came up empty.
“She had open looks,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “She just wasn’t knocking them down. That’s going to happen in this game of basketball.”
And that pretty much summed up the rest of the game as the Women of Troy (10-4, 2-1) came up empty in their attempt to stretch their winning streak to seven games.
The No. 12 UCLA Bruins (13-1, 3-0) won in decisive fashion 61-42, using a stifling defense to limit a USC offense to just 28 percent shooting from the field.
“It’s very disappointing,” said junior guard Ashley Corral. “You always want to come to UCLA and play hard, play tough and try to get a win. They were another road block in our path to success, and today we got stopped.”
UCLA’s Jasmine Dixon finished with a game-high 20 points and nine rebounds and ultimately proved to be the difference in the game.
The Women of Troy and the Bruins exchanged baskets in the early going with four lead changes, but the Bruins went on a 18-5 run during the last 15 minutes in the first half that gave them a 26-13 advantage going into halftime.
“I thought our defense kept us in there,” Cooper said. “We held the 12th best team in the country to 26 points in the first half — that’s pretty good. We just weren’t generating any offense.”
A full-court press and a zone defense stifled the Women of Troy on offense as they managed to shoot just 5-for-22 from the field in the first half.
More glaringly though, they committed 10 turnovers and gave up nine offensive rebounds.
The second half wouldn’t prove to be much different as the Bruins opened up with a 8-2 run in the first three minutes, pushing their lead to 36-15.
For much of the rest of the game, the Women of Troy struggled to establish any type of offensive consistency and the Bruins led by as many as 25 points.
“You’re not going to win many games when you shoot just 27 percent, and we’re a better shooting team than that,” Cooper said. “For us to score 13 points in a half … I haven’t seen that all season.”
Besides their shooting woes, USC had difficulty keeping the Bruins off the offensive glass as they gave up a total of 19 offensive rebounds that led to 19 second chance points.
Gilbreath struggled from the field the entire game, misfiring on all 12 attempts. She finished with nine points — all from the free-throw line — and eight rebounds.
Corral led USC with 14 points, with 11 coming in the second half.
The next game for the Women of Troy will be against Oregon at the Galen Center on Thursday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m.

During all the hooting and hollering erupting from the NCAA bowl season, USC was conspicuously silent.
The Trojans, muzzled by NCAA sanctions, have known since the summer that no matter how well they performed this year, they would be sitting at home during the postseason.
It must have been hard watching Stanford smash Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl. The Cardinal played with the swagger and confidence of a program on the rise, characteristics that were once practically a trademark of USC.
It must have been grueling to watch Auburn lift the crystal ball after taking down Oregon.
But alas, sanctions are sanctions. One year down, one more to go. But to think, the Trojans will be back in this same position a year from now…
Or will they? More importantly, should they?
USC athletic director Pat Haden and his staff are preparing vigorously for an appeal in front of the NCAA’s Infractions Appeals Committee that is set to take place Jan. 22. Haden will seek a softening of the harsh penalties levied by the NCAA, which include a two-year bowl ban and a reduction of 30 scholarships over three seasons.
The appeal, once thought of as a formality without a chance in you know where, now looks, to a rational person at least, like it might have a realistic shot at succeeding.
This has been a nightmare season for the NCAA’s image. I’m sure it expected the debilitating penalties USC received to at least scare some of the other programs into following the rules.
Just the opposite happened.
The season was littered with news of violations and penalties for schools across the country. Most notable, of course, was the controversy swirling around Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, which included Newton’s father shopping him around when he was being recruited out of junior college.
Most recently, Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor and teammates were found to have been selling jerseys and championship rings, while receiving improper benefits from a tattoo parlor and its owner.
These were the two highest profile cases in a season that also started out with major violations occurring at North Carolina. Oh, and there was the whole issue of the former agent who came out and said he routinely paid dozens of college athletes throughout the ‘90s.
With all this foul play exposed on a seemingly weekly basis, the NCAA had a chance to show that its highest priority was to making the game fair again, rather than fattening its pocket book.
But instead, when the NCAA was about to take a financial hit, the penalties never seemed to fit the crime.
Newton was cleared to play without penalty because there was no “sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn was aware” of his father’s pay-for-play scheme. That sounds about as likely as Reggie Bush not knowing that his parents were getting rides in limousines and living rent-free.
Newton quickly emerged as the game’s biggest star, and the NCAA was not going to do anything to get in the way. It meant a Heisman Trophy, a national title appearance, and a whole lot of dollar signs for the NCAA.
Pryor and his Ohio State teammates were suspended, yes, but not for the Sugar Bowl. The NCAA knows ratings and ticket sales would have plummeted if Pryor were absent for the bowl game. The NCAA, in their profit-driven wisdom, settled on suspending the Buckeye players for the first five games of next season.
Decisions like these scream injustice, and I’m sure Haden is going to pull out all the pie charts and graphs he can to make the appeals committee see this. He should demand the second year of the bowl ban be dropped. He should demand 10 scholarships be returned.
But, of course, knowing the NCAA, this is a long shot.
“The notion that the NCAA is selective with its eligibility decisions and rules enforcement is another myth with no basis in fact,” the NCAA said in a statement after the Ohio State decision. “Money is not a motivator or factor as to why one school would get a particular decision versus another.”
“Any insinuation that revenue from bowl games in particular would influence NCAA decisions is absurd, because schools and conferences receive that revenue, not the NCAA.”
Right — as if the NCAA is some non-profit organization seeking only the sanctity of college athletics.
Haden has a strong argument and he will make it. But if next year is another USC-less bowl season, no one will really be that surprised. We’re all used to the hypocrisy by now.

No matter which college basketball powerhouses USC competes against in the non-conference portion of its schedule, the two biggest games of the season are against UCLA.
Inside presence · In his first game since removing a cast from his left hand, senior center Alex Stepheson notched his sixth double-double of the year with 13 points and 16 rebounds. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
In his first three games against the crosstown rivals, USC coach Kevin O’Neill is undefeated.
“I guess that is important around here,” O’Neill said about beating UCLA. “It is not just another game. It is a big win for us.”
A standing-room-only student section packed the Galen Center to see USC (10-6, 2-1) earn its fourth consecutive victory against UCLA (9-6, 1-2) on Sunday, 63-52.
“[The win] means everything to us,” senior forward Alex Stepheson said. “The whole city of Los Angeles watches this game.”
Feeding off the rowdy sold-out crowd, the Trojans opened the game on a 10-4 run. But after junior guard Jio Fontan committed a flagrant foul against UCLA forward Reeves Nelson, the Bruins went on a 5-0 run and led 30-28 by halftime.
UCLA came into the game having never lost in the eight games that they led at halftime. Unfazed, the Trojans set the tempo to begin the second half, opening on a 12-4 run and never relinquishing the lead.
“The crowd helped pick us up,” Stepheson said. “They were the sixth man, and gave us an energy boost in the second half when we needed it.”
The Trojans received dominant performances from Stepheson and junior forward Nikola Vucevic, who had a game-high 20 points. Stepheson added 13 points and 16 rebounds, including six offensive rebounds.
In the first half, senior guard Marcus Simmons was able to contain forward Tyler Honeycutt, the Bruins’ second leading scorer. It took Honeycutt more than 10 minutes to score his first basket, at which point Simmons was resting on the bench. Honeycutt only scored four points in the first half.
With Simmons sidelined for much of the second half with foul trouble, guards Fontan, Bryce Jones and Donte Smith split time frustrating Honeycutt, who finished with 10 points and tied his season-high with seven turnovers.
While Honeycutt did not provide his standard offensive production in the first half, forward Reeves Nelson, UCLA’s leading scorer, flourished. Nelson made his first five field goal attempts, and finished the opening half with 12 points. USC managed to make adjustments defensively in the second half, however, only allowing Nelson to score two points after halftime.
Fontan had 10 points and three assists for the Trojans. Freshman guard Maurice Jones added nine points and four steals.
Despite the 11-point win, O’Neill was not entirely pleased with his team’s performance, pointing out the fact that Bruins made 57 percent of their shots in the first half, and the Trojans only made half of their free throw attempts.
“We know that [UCLA] will play better next time,” O’Neill said. “We will have to play better the entire game to have a chance to win.”
USC will embark on their first road trip of the Pac-10 Conference season, traveling to Eugene, Ore. to play Oregon on Thursday, and then to Corvallis, Ore. to take on Oregon State on Saturday.

There are few sure bets in the sporting world. Athletic seasons are inherently volatile, hinging on a few lucky bounces, the avoidance of injuries and key players’ abilities to perform in clutch situations.
String of success · Since 1998, USC coach Jovan Vavic has won a combined nine national championships as head of both the men’s and women’s water polo programs.  -   Daily Trojan file photo 
Despite these variables, you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who is betting against the USC men’s water polo team — not again, at least, after many pegged the Trojans for a middling finish in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in 2010.
Instead, the Trojans won the MPSF Championship this past season en route to the program’s third consecutive NCAA title, downing California 12-10 in overtime.
The sobering reality for all other NCAA water polo programs is that there does not appear to be any end in sight to the Trojans’ streak of dominance.
Remarkably, the team will return virtually every starter next fall, including junior goalie Joel Dennerley, the MPSF Player of the Year, and two freshmen, driver Nikola Vavic and two-meter Jeremy Davie, who led the team in scoring.
Teams first became acquainted with Vavic and Davie in the NorCal Tournament, as they lit up the scoresheet with a multitude of goals, helping the Trojans defeat three top-five teams to secure their first No. 1 ranking of the season. Instilled with confidence, the team went across town to play at the SoCal Tournament two weeks later, winning the event for the eighth consecutive season, after narrowly edging out UCLA in another championship game.
“After we won the NorCal Tournament, it was still a little too early to read much into it,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “It was after we won the SoCal Tournament with a great game against UCLA in the finals that we became more confident and realized that we are pretty darn good.”
In a season of sustained success, the nadir was unquestionably the consecutive losses to Stanford and Cal directly following the SoCal Tournament. Star offensive players, including Vavic, Davie and junior driver Peter Kurzeka, hit the proverbial wall as the offense began to rely too heavily on the trio’s scoring prowess, straying from the diverse scoring attack that was so successful throughout the season. Even Dennerley’s otherworldly goaltending could no longer mask a sudden downturn in defensive tenacity and execution.
Whether such a young team could bounce back from losses to two powerhouses was anyone’s guess
“The turning point was our game against UCLA [at home],” said junior two-meter Matt Burton. “Both those losses really had us re-evaluate how badly we wanted to win and what we were willing to sacrifice to get there. I think everyone went home after that Cal loss, and decided that they were going to step up their defense from then on.”
The defense would improve sharply, as the Trojans trimmed their goals against average per game to lead the league in the statistic by the end of the season. Combined with a league-leading offense, their subsequent success came as no surprise.
The MPSF playoffs followed a familiar script: gutsy, narrow wins against Cal and Stanford, along with more comfortable wins against the rest of the MPSF and non-conference opponents.
Undoubtedly, the knowledge that the Trojans did not blow out many top-tier teams will inspire the team to work harder.
“There’s so much room for improvement,” Vavic said. “We are a team that had some ups and downs. We gave up way too many scoring spurts and blew several leads. We need to be focused for 32 minutes. Our two-meter defense also has to get better. We gave up too many natural goals from two-meters.”
