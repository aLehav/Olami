No. 1 USC women’s water polo fell 9-8 to No. 2 Stanford in its first loss of the 2019 season Saturday afternoon at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
This was the Cardinal’s biggest win of the season, snapping USC’s 37-game winning streak. Stanford advanced to 15-1 on the season, while USC fell to 20-1.
USC started the game strong, shutting out the Cardinal in the first period with freshman 2-meter Tilly Kearns scoring 2 goals. Junior driver Kelsey McIntosh and senior driver Courtney Fahey had 2 goals and 1 goal, respectively.
The Trojans entered the second half with a 5-2 lead, but the power dynamic began to level out when both sides scored 2 points in the third period. Although the Trojans entered the final period with a 3-point lead, the Cardinal found their scoring momentum and brought the score up to 8-7 for their first lead of the game. Junior driver Denise Mammolito secured the final goal of regulation play with 1:24 left to tie the score, which sent the game into overtime.   
Despite a save by senior goalie Amanda Longan, one of her 15 for the game, Stanford managed to net 1 goal in overtime, and USC could not answer back for a final score of 9-8.
Stanford junior driver Makenzie Fischer had 3 goals while freshman driver Ryann Neushul and sophomore driver Sarah Klass scored 2 goals each to lead the Cardinal on offense. Redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Emalia Eichelberger had 11 saves on the day to anchor their defense.
This was the Trojans’ first home game since former head coach Jovan Vavic was fired last month for his alleged involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme. 
“Our program is about discipline and hard work, and I have the best girls in the world,” interim head coach Casey Moon told the Los Angeles Times last week. “They understand what this program stands for, and it helps that I have a lot of veterans returning, so they can reiterate what the makeup of our team is and the staples we expect out of each player.” 
Moon continued to credit his veteran players for rising to the occasion in the wake of the announcement.  
“Their leadership and what we’ve been preaching as a coaching staff [and] as a program to them, they just kind of rallied around it,” Moon said. “What happened was out of their control. But I think the mood of the team was great. I think they have a little chip on their shoulder.”
Despite the major change, the Trojans are doing their best to adjust. 
“The team is doing remarkably well,” Fahey said in a video released by USC Athletics on Tuesday. “I think that we’re all a really strong group of girls, and it’s really cool to see how this program has taught us about resilience, and how resilient every single one of the girls on this team really are.” 
Although the Trojans are no longer perfect on the season, their ultimate goal remains winning a national championship. 
“I think we trust our coaches and our teammates enough to use the adversity that we’ve had to overcome recently, and are still overcoming, to kind of use it as fuel to our fire, to make it even more important now that we win a national title than ever before,” Longan said in the video.
The Trojans travel north next week to take on Cal at Spieker Aquatics Complex. The conference match begins Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

The No. 9 USC men’s volleyball team earned victories in its matches against No. 6 Stanford and No. 10 BYU this weekend. The Trojans improved to an overall record of 15-8, and their conference record rose to 6-4. USC remains undefeated in Galen Center with 10 wins on the season and has won four matches in a row. Additionally, the Trojans’ 15 regular season wins mark the most of any team under head coach Jeff Nygaard.
The Cardinal took a sizable 11-5 lead in the first set Friday, but USC was able to breach the gap, tying Stanford at 15 points apiece. After some back-and-forth action, consecutive kills from senior outside hitter Jack Wyett were enough to secure the first set for the Trojans 25-23.
But the Cardinal were eager to run up an early lead on USC again in the second set, snagging the first 3 points. The Trojans answered back by winning the next 3 points and eventually took a 16-12 lead later in the set. Stanford was unable to overcome the deficit and USC took the second set 25-20.
The third and fourth sets followed a similar pattern, as neither team was able to pull ahead of the other for the majority of the frames. However, Stanford had well-timed runs, ultimately capturing the sets 25-21 and 25-22, respectively.
In the fifth and final set, however, USC swung the momentum back in its favor. The Trojans were able to take the first 2 points and never looked back, winning 15-10.
After the match, senior outside hitter Ryan Moss said the team was able to regain its composure before the final set.
“I think we played steady the whole match … Just when it got tight in those third and fourth sets, we didn’t come through … but we had faith in the type of volleyball we were playing,” Moss said.
Wyett and fellow senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso led the way with 18 kills each, while Moss added 15 kills of his own. Sophomore middle blocker Kyle Gear tallied four blocks, while Moss and Grasso contributed five and three blocks, respectively. Sophomore setter Chris Hall aided the Trojan cause with 47 assists, and senior libero Matt Douglas collected 11 digs.
In Saturday’s match against BYU, the Trojans ran up a sizable lead on the Cougars in the first two sets. BYU surged back with determination in both frames, yet it was unable to overcome the vast point differentials. USC captured the two sets 25-20 and 25-22, respectively.
But the third set of the match was a different story. The Cougars jumped out to an early 4-2 lead, but the Trojans fought back to bring themselves up 7-5. This back-and-forth trend continued throughout most of the set, with neither team able to pull ahead by more than 2 points. With the score tied at 19, the Trojans finally put an end to that by going on a 6-2 run, winning the set with a score of 25-21 and securing a three-set sweep.
According to Moss, the Trojans were successful in withstanding BYU’s surges in the first two sets.
“When we [went] up big and they were creeping back in we [reminded] ourselves not to be too hungry to get to that 25 and [to] just take it a point at a time,” Moss said. “I think we did a nice job of resetting and getting there tonight.”
Moss said the team had to adjust its mindset in order to take command at the end of a volatile third set.
“We just tried to keep our minds steady and focused… and we made a couple [of] plays when it mattered,” he said.
Wyett and Grasso once again led the Trojans with 11 kills apiece, while Moss added nine kills. Sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis was instrumental in the Trojans’ defense, tallying a personal season record of seven blocks, while Wyett added another four. Hall earned 31 assists and seven digs, while Douglas chipped in eight digs of his own.
After a series of impressive victories at Galen Center, USC will look to continue its winning trend in the final two matches of the regular season against Pepperdine Thursday and UCLA Saturday.

The calendar might read April, but we are entering the final week of March Madness in the NCAA Tournament  — and this year’s field has once again resulted in excitement, upsets and highlights heading into the Final Four this weekend. 
This tournament is — without a doubt — the most thrilling four-week stretch in sports. Placing 68 teams in one bracket and having them play winner-takes-all elimination games until one team remains is inherently exciting. According to the American Gaming Association, nearly $8.5 billion will be wagered on this year’s tournament. From gambling to friendly office pools, we have an insatiable thirst for predicting winners of games between college basketball teams, half of which casual sports fans have never seen play.
Which brings us to an often discussed Catch-22: How do we go about enjoying and betting on what is objectively an incredible sports tournament, given the fact that none of the players (ahem, “student-athletes”) who are pouring their blood, sweat and tears into these games receive a cent of compensation for their efforts? And what is it about college sports specifically that draws our attention?
Let’s make two things clear here. First, college athletes should absolutely be paid — period, full stop. It is ridiculous for the NCAA to rake in upward of $1 billion per year in revenue off the backs of its athletes while insisting upon the sanctity of amateurism and the value of a free education. 
Second, college basketball is far from the best brand of basketball out there. The worst NBA team would still blow out the NCAA national champion easily. So would most teams in the G-League, the NBA’s developmental league. But there is not nearly as much interest in the NBA playoffs or the G-League as there is in the NCAA tournament. And the EuroLeague, widely regarded as the second-best basketball league in the world behind the NBA, barely registers on Americans’ radars. 
There is just something about the college game that makes us pay attention to what is essentially mediocre basketball being played by people we have never heard of. Aside from Duke’s Zion Williamson, what true household name is there in college basketball? 
Perhaps it is the excitement that comes with single-game elimination, the fact that we can go from casually following a game to becoming fully invested in a thrilling finish (as I write this column, Purdue and Virginia are playing in overtime for a spot in the Final Four, and I do not care that I will be late for my dinner plans). Or maybe we care more about the programs than the players themselves — we are constantly intrigued by teams like Duke, North Carolina and Gonzaga that seem to be on top every year. 
The latter possibility is a problem. When we start valuing programs more than the players that make them great, when we recognize the names of coaches — Krzyzewski, Boeheim, Williams, Izzo — more than those of the players who actually win games for them, it enables the continued exploitation of college athletes.
These athletes are drawn to programs like Duke and North Carolina because of the history, lured in by the chance to play for a well-known coach and on national television every night. In return, they get their 15 minutes of fame during March Madness, with just a small percentage of them actually being good enough to make it to the professional ranks and become household names. 
Fair trade off? Not even close. Yet, we still eat it up. We eagerly fill out brackets, grab a beer and tune in to support the hypocrisy that is the NCAA. This is how the NCAA continues to thrive. This is how something so fun and exciting can be run by an institution so corrupt and bad. This is how Michigan State coach Tom Izzo can berate and humiliate one of his players on the sideline in a viral meltdown, refuse to apologize and get away with it — because Izzo is Michigan State, and he knows it. We all know it. 
Unfortunately, there’s not much that can be done. Like football, March Madness is too embedded in sports culture for it to be canceled. We will watch the Super Bowl knowing that there is a scientifically proven link between football and brain damage. And we will fill out our brackets during the NCAA Tournament for the chance to make some quick cash, knowing that it will be more than what the players laboring on the court will make trying to extend their 15 minutes of fame.Eric He is a senior writing about current events in sports.

Fans at The Wiltern got a taste of Maren Morris’ bubbly energy at the GIRL World Tour Saturday night. Though it has only been three weeks since the release of her album “GIRL,”  Morris has already been on tour for nearly a month. But, that didn’t make her L.A. stop any less electric.
“It’s crazy that people already know the words when the album was just released. I’m still learning the words!” Morris joked to the crowd. Judging by their enthusiastic reactions, fans had already learned her lyrics.
The crowd, though loud during the entire show, became deafening when Morris performed some of her older tracks, especially “Rich,” “80s Mercedes” and EDM crossover hit “The Middle.” While Morris performed a diverse mix of songs from her first album, there was a fire in the performance of her new songs.
The loudest cheers erupted when the first arpeggios of “The Bones” rang throughout the auditorium. Clearly impressed with her fans’ recognition, Morris flashed the crowd a smile.
Though she isn’t yet selling out stadiums, it’s clear Morris has taken inspiration from Taylor Swift, whom she joined onstage at the Reputation Stadium Tour in Arlington, last fall. Like Swift, (although it might be fun to simply watch her dance around the stage) Morris’ star power emerges when she stands centerstage and talks to the crowd — with nothing more than her guitar. 
The high production value of Morris’ set complemented her minimalist performance style.
From cotton candy-scented bubbles and rainforest-scented fog to neon backgrounds and dancing strobe lights, the stage design was interactive and kept fans engaged for the entirety of Morris’ set. It was clear throughout the show that Morris wanted fans to have fun with her music, even if her messages are sometimes sad.
“Making this album was a giant love fest, every song was written with friends,” Maren told the crowd. “Everybody gets sad sometimes, but having sad songs on the radio [and on tour] makes us feel more normal.” She then launched into her first number one single, “I Could Use a Love Song.”
In one of the more emotional moments of the night, Maren spoke to the crowd about the impact her song “My Church” has had on her career. Standing on stage with just a guitar and a spotlight on her, her voice broke as she joked about starting to cry every time she thought about the song. In response, the audience carried her through the bridge and final chorus, belting every word.
To appease concertgoers who don’t like country, Morris performed the Zedd-produced “The Middle” to the loudest cheers of the night. For one of the biggest songs of 2018, the relatively tame country crowd turned became reminiscent of a rave when she performed the hit song.
Morris’ impressive stage presence can be attributed to her voice. For the majority of the show, her vocals either matched or exceeded the album’s studio quality, leaving the audience in awe. With a few smash hits under her belt and impeccable prowess for live renditions, Morris cemented her star potential to every one who witnessed Saturday’s performance.

After much anticipation, 17-year-old pop prodigy Billie Eilish released her debut studio album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” Friday. Mixing electronic production with her signature somber lyrics, Eilish creates a pop-noir album that distinguishes her from her contemporaries. 
The album lends a peek into the mind of one of the music industry’s most highly acclaimed Gen Z artists. She speaks openly about her struggles with mental health and her songs are rife with refreshing references to sadness and love. On this album, she lures listeners deep inside her world, through its existing dark shadows, and then wraps the audience with her sorrowful lyrics. 
On “My Strange Addiction,” Eilish interpolates clips from “The Office,” a show she has publicly professed her love for on a number of occasions. The song’s upbeat sultriness is contrasted by the voices of sitcom characters as she sings about an emotional tie she can’t seem to break.
“My Strange Addiction” evokes imagery of pill-popping and painful withdrawal symptoms, but Eilish has condemned her own personal drug use numerous times, most recently in a March 29 article from The Guardian. 
“I have never done drugs, I’ve never got high, I’ve never smoked anything in my life,” Eilish told The Guardian. “I don’t give a fuck, I never have.”
Eilish further explores her nightmarish brand of electropop in “Bury a Friend,” the album’s spookiest song as well of one of its hit singles, released Jan. 30. The song is so dark that it becomes easy to forget that Eilish, who recorded her dreamy hit single “Ocean Eyes” at only 14, is not even old enough to vote. 
Another standout on the album is “I Love You.” The soft ballad features her brother and frequent collaborator Finneas, and speaks of the complicated feelings between two lovers who are struggling to maintain the relationship. 
“And nothing has to change today,” Eillish sings softly. “You didn’t mean to say ‘I love you.’” 
The ballad stands out against the rest of the album’s electronic productions and softly leads into the final track, “Goodbye,” the first line of which begs “Please, please / don’t leave me.” 
With the release of her LP, Eilish has cemented herself as the new darling of anti-pop. Despite her defiance against mainstream sounds, the teenage artist has found unprecedented success by taking unconventional yet authentic approaches to her craft.
Eilish is in full control of her work, from writing her own songs to being her own creative director — a rare feat that has allowed her to catapult into the cultural zeitgeist with nearly three years worth of streaming hits and collaborations. 
Deeply personal, edgy and slightly ghoulish, “When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” not only showcases Eilish’s hauntingly contagious energy, but also stands as a testament to her uncanny ability to defy genre barriers.
While Eilish didn’t need an album to solidify her stardom, this debut does exactly that. If there was any doubt about Eilish’s ability to continue redefining the music industry, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” reminds us that Eilish’s journey is only just the beginning.

Three Essential Documentaries from the Month Of March (The Docs of March)
In a recent interview with NPR, Thom Powers, programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival, said we are living through an “undeniable golden age for documentary filmmaking.” In January, “Knock Down the House” broke the Sundance Film Festival documentary sales record when it was sold to Netflix for $10 million. In the same month, Lifetime’s highly successful “Surviving R. Kelly” detailed the litany of horrifying allegations that dogged the singer for the past 25 years, prompting Kelly’s February indictment on 10 counts of criminal sexual abuse. 
Both films demonstrate the newfound capacity of documentaries to not only succeed commercially, but also drive the national conversation and incite necessary and long overdue change. For decades, HBO has been an industry leader in documentary filmmaking, churning out several Oscar nominees and winners. 
March was no different for the company. Here are four new documentaries that emerged in the last month exemplifying where the “golden age” of documentary filmmaking is headed. 

The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley – HBO
 In “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” director Alex Gibney details the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes, the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire — and current defendant in a pending federal criminal case.
Holmes was once at the helm of Theranos, a company she founded with the promise of its machines’ ability to quickly perform 200 types of blood tests from a single pin prick, no painful scary needle required. At its peak, the company employed 800 and was valued at $9 billion.
Unfortunately, Theranos was built on a baseless lie. Unbeknownst to the public, Holmes’ blood-testing technology did not work, and one of Silicon Valley’s greatest success stories turned out to be rooted in a lie. 
Gibney tells the story of Holmes and Theranos through a careful array of interviews, voiceovers, CGI animations of needles piercing skin and soundbites of Holmes retroactively looking like a fool caught in the deluge of lies she tells on camera. 
Entertaining and informative, “The Inventor” sheds a bright light on a fundamentally preposterous tale of mishandled ambition and overinflated ego. 

Leaving Neverland- HBO
In “Leaving Neverland,” director Dan Reed tells the story of two men and their families: Wade Robson and James Safechuck. Throughout  the film’s 240-minute run time, the two men recount their relationship with the late “King of Pop” Michael Jackson who was accused of years of sexual molestation and assault. 
Despite recalling harrowing encounters with Jackson, Robson and Safechuck describe his techniques of predation, grooming and rape with a remarkable level of composure. In addition to the interviews, Reed makes use of various ephemera such as personal photographs, videos and calls with family members — most notably the men’s mothers — to share their own accounts of Jackson’s deceit and manipulation. 
Reed’s work does not distract itself with delving into Jackson’s career and music, rather focusing on Robson’s and Safechuck’s recollections. Their courage is evident and their honesty gut-wrenching. 
After its release, “Leaving Neverland” sparked a furious debate over Jackson’s legacy, with many reconsidering their fandom in light of the convincing portrait Reed paints of a manipulative, abusive and wholly evil Jackson. 
Still, despite whatever flaws the documentary may have — and there are few, including a lengthy runtime that has drawn criticism — is worth taking the time to watch. “Leaving Neverland” does not force its viewer believe Robson’s and Safechuck’s confessionals, nor is it a retrial for Jackson. It simply allows its subjects to finally be heard. And considering the decades its taken them to tell their stories, it may be worth the required four hours to listen to their perspective 

One Nation Under Stress– HBO
In “One Nation Under Stress,” directors Marc Levin and Daphne Pinkerson follow neurosurgeon and investigative journalist Dr. Sanjay Gupta as he tries to answer the question: If the United States spends more on health care than any other country in the world, why is America experiencing decreased life expectancies?
Gupta’s answer is stress — an omnipresent and oppressive type of stress — which is revealed through interviews with various doctors, health professionals, experts and residents of rust-belt communities. 
Gupta explores this particular form of stress in visits to Petrolia, Penn., where a recent plant closure has left many in the community — predominantly white and working class — feeling helpless and abandoned.  
Gupta also speaks to health professionals in his home city of Atlanta to discuss disparities in health care between black and white populations as well as disproportionate social stresses faced by minority groups.
Throughout the documentary, Gupta displays an incredible level of empathy and concisely communicates complex medical concepts. He feels invested in, rather than separate from, the issues he confronts, thereby humanizing the film and emphasizing its relevance in light of the divisive political climate. 

The Case Against Adnan Syed- HBO
In 2014, WBEZ’s podcast “Serial” told the story of Adnan Syed, a high school student convicted of the 1999 murder of fellow classmate and ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. The podcast, hosted by Sarah Koenig, re-examined the the evidence surrounding Syed’s trial and ultimately led to his conviction pending retrial. The podcast erupted into a national phenomenon, while catapulting the genre of true crime into the stratosphere of American pop culture.
While Koenig’s “Serial” was groundbreaking and entertaining, it also left many questions unanswered. In HBO’s new four-part docuseries, “T0he Case Against Adnan Syed,” director Amy Berg revisits the case, uncovering the elements the podcast left unexplored.
Berg’s series retells the story of Lee’s murder with a sense of empathy that “Serial” lacked. The first delves into the back-story of Hae Min Lee, whose memory is largely illustrated as an afterthought in the podcast. 
The attempt to paint a more expansive portrait of the story’s victim is admirable and well-intentioned, but it also feels as if the creators refused to let the story of the victim rest. In addition, Berg’s framing of Lee’s backstory does more to exonerate Syed rather than pay respect to Lee’s memory. 
 Many of those wrapped up in the commercial spectacle that was “Serial” finally get the opportunity to be heard, following years of their accounts remaining stagnant in online litigation. In the documentary, friends and witnesses who appeared in “Serial” describe how Koenig’s reporting effectively took over their lives, forcing them to relive the trauma of Lee’s death and Syed’s trial. 
 Still, the series is a welcomed companion to the critically acclaimed podcast and worth viewing if not for the third episode alone, where crucial cell-phone evidence is revisited and the racial dynamics between Baltimore’s Pakistani, Korean and black communities is further examined.

At first glance, McClintock Avenue seems peaceful and serene, with the sun shining on students as they head to class. However, tensions lurk beneath this warm facade between two factions at USC: the Wheel People and the Foot People.
The Wheel People — marked by their earbuds — use scooters, bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, hoverboards and even unicycles to traverse campus. In contrast, the Foot People — distinguished by the phones in their hands — use only their legs to travel from place to place.
While it may seem like these two tribes exist in harmony, skirmishes taking place all across campus prove otherwise.
A Foot Person muttered, “Dude, watch it,” after almost being hit by a member of the Wheels. 
“Dumbasses on their phones,” the Wheel Person retorted, zooming away.
A recent attempt at diplomacy at McCarthy Quad quickly took a turn for the worse.
“Parkside’s so far,” Foot Person Meg Sullins said. “Can we just go to EVK?”
Wheel Person Paul Todd straightened up, alert. 
“You should get a skateboard,” he said pointedly.
Surrounding students held their breaths in anticipation of a possible battle, this inevitable release of tension.
“Maybe,” said Sullins, barely skating by the beginning of an ensuing battle.
While the palpable anger at McCarthy Quad eventually fizzled out, the widespread tension across USC indicates that war is almost certainly imminent. 
In Taper Hall, for example, fighting nearly broke out when Wheel Person Lily Jones, carrying her scooter, requested that she and her classmates take the elevator.
“You should really just walk to class,” Foot Person Dan Garcia said.
The hallways went silent. The surrounding Trojans paused and stared.
“Well, I don’t wanna be slowed down,” Jones said.
“Hmm,” Garcia replied.
“Hmm,” Jones said.
Everyone resumed activity, having only narrowly escaped a violent altercation.
For now, USC is only simmering with tension. The Trojan Wheel People and Foot People have tolerated one another for decades without fighting. However, with the rising number of skirmishes, it seems that a race war may be on the horizon.

In a shocking change of character, the once-cuddly, beloved EVKitty is now intimidating transfer students for meal swipes.
Incidents were first reported when the feline returned from winter break, muscled up and determined to make up for missing out on nearly a month’s worth of free meals. EVKitty entered spring semester equipped with impressive pectorals and tribal sleeve tattoos, making it clear she wasn’t going to let another plate of mediocre pizza or questionable beef stroganoff slip away.
Transfer classmates, still viewing EVKitty as the friendly creature raved about by returning USC students, were shocked by their encounters. Unsuspecting newbies often approached the cat expecting a leg-snuggle or playful walk across their keyboard. To their surprise, she instead stood on her hind legs, grabbed them by the shirt collar and demanded that they swipe her in for a full meal at Everybody’s Kitchen.
“I froze. I didn’t know what to do,” exclaimed Tyler Gronsberg, a timid transfer student from George Mason University. “She told me that if I didn’t swipe her, she would shove my head in the toilet and make me recite the Trojan Fight Song. I just got here! I barely know what that is!”
EVKitty soon expanded her reach to the Parkside and USC Village dining halls, as well as Moreton Fig when tracking down transfers with particularly low willpower and rich parents.
“You can sniff it out,” explained EVKitty, whose ability to speak fluent English gained the over months of mooching leftover cereal from study groups and gossiping sorority girls.
“My favorites are the ones who concede immediately,” EVKitty said. “It’s a simpler process that way: I tell them swipe me in. They say no. I call them a lil’ bitch. Soon enough, I’m eating like Nikias is having Thanksgiving Dinner all over again.”
DPS has been notified of the cat’s antics, but has done little to ameliorate the issue, citing “her deep, gravelly voice” and “those traps.”
It is unclear just how many swipes the muscled feline has accumulated over the semester from transfer students. In speculation, EVKitty put down her cigarette, released a hearty laugh, and calculated “around 2,300, not counting the times I’ve used them just to get one of those crappy apples to throw at kids.”
Regarding her long-term goals behind the bullying, the now-infamous cat answered: “I’m about to eat until people think I’m having kittens. That way I’ll get some sympathy swipes from old customers.”

After a grueling search to permanently fill the vacant position of USC president after the resignation of C. L. Max Nikias, the Board of Trustees decided that a new Starbucks will helm the University.
Board Chairman Rick Caruso announced the decision Monday and made it clear that the Board of Trustees took the concerns of students, faculty and alumni into account.
“We know this University is in desperate need for some severe changes to how we operate, and the Board of Trustees and I can’t think of a better entity to best serve our student’s interests than the place that invented the Double Chocolatey Chip Frappuccino. Kids love that!” Caruso said.
The Board previously appointed Wanda Austin as the University’s interim president while the search took place. Austin, who served on President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology released a statement in support of the Board’s decision.
“The USC Community deserves a leader that is committed to enacting change that will end the harmful culture that has allowed past abhorrent behaviors to take place,” Austin wrote. “Y’know, like the place that tried to make the Unicorn Frappuccino a thing, not some nobody who was the former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corp.”
Students were confused by the logistics of the decision. Sophomore Dominic Nguyen didn’t know what to make of the situation. 
“So, they built a new Starbucks and [are] letting it make the decisions,” Nguyen said. “It won’t take any action! It’ll be Nikias all over again!”
Caruso acknowledged the community resistance to letting an inanimate building take control of the University, but insisted the move was in the school’s best interest.
“Look, those Starbucks make a killing,” Caruso explained. “We put one of ’em in charge, and we’ll have money flowing out our nostrils!”
When asked what the University would do with the revenue, Caruso shrugged nonchalantly. 
 “I don’t know? How ’bout another Starbucks? That’s what the kids like, right?” Caruso said.

Bright flashing lights and strings of colorful balloons engulfed McCarthy Quad as nearly 5,500 students danced to performances by rappers Trippie Redd and Gunna at Springfest. The annual concert, hosted by the Concerts Committee, invited students to interact with an augmented reality art piece featuring a large, geometric dome and pose in front of a virtual reality mural. 
Trippie Redd, who was announced as the headliner Friday, performed songs like “Topanga” and “Love Scars” as concertgoers moshed and danced to the beat of blaring music. The announcement, which did not occur until the day before the concert, followed rumors that Lil Uzi Vert would be headlining at this year’s Springfest. 
“[Lil Uzi Vert] was an artist that we’ve considered for our Springfest show for some time now,” Stiers said. 
Though some students were disappointed that Lil Uzi was not the headliner, others expressed their excitement for Trippie Redd.
“My friend got us all into this song ‘Topanga’ back in September … and we’ve been blasting that song every single weekend,” said Amelia Katz, a freshman in the World Bachelor of Business program. “When they announced Trippie Redd [as the headliner,] we all screamed.” 
Trippie Redd’s set was energetic — the audience jumped and danced along while he performed songs like “Love Scars” and “Take a Walk.”
“I think this year’s Springfest was a lot more diverse and a lot more immersive,” Concerts Committee Director Kira Stiers said. “We had a really wide-ranging roster of artists that I think kind of touch on every genre.” 
Before Trippie Redd took the stage, rappers Taco and J.I.D, indie artist Still Woozy and electronic music artist TroyBoi performed their respective sets. Rapper Gunna took the stage as the concert’s mystery act.
Taco, a member of Odd Future, opened the concert with a quick jab at the recent college admissions scandal before starting his DJ set to a sparse crowd. 
“If you paid to get into college, raise your hand!” Taco said. “Whose parents paid? Whose parents are going to jail?”   
Students screamed as Still Woozy took the stage to perform “Goodie Bag” and “Vacation.”  They crowded around him as he hopped off the stage and over the barrier to perform the hit “X” while singing along with the audience. 
Atlanta-based rapper J.I.D. followed Still Woozy and performed several songs from his 2018 album “DiCaprio 2,” including “Off Deez.” 
Students jumped and danced to the beat as Troyboi performed his hit single “Grimey.” He also played “Afterhours” and “Do You?”
Mystery guest artist Gunna then took the stage and performed “Drip too Hard.” After a few songs, he brought out Young Thug and performed “Oh Okay” and “Chanel.” 
The event also featured booths from sponsors such as AT&T, Apple Pay, Shein, United Airlines and Global Inheritance, which hosted an interactive playground that allowed students to charge their phones by using playground equipment.  
Students also lined up for a virtual and augmented reality installation called The Immersive Experience. The installation,  which was created by Merciv, an experimental design company co-founded by Iovine and Young Academy seniors Cam Lindsay and Jacob Fishman, allowed users to enter  an inflatable igloo and virtually paint on the side of Von KleinSmid Center.  
In addition to introducing the immersive art experience, Concerts Committee also established new guidelines to ensure the safety of students, including a no-guest policy. Once the venue reached capacity, students were only admitted as other students left. 
“They’re really taking security into the measure here. As you can see they shut down the festival because of capacity,” said Drew McGrane, a senior majoring in sociology, said as he stood in line to enter McCarthy Quad. 
Once the event reached the 5,500-person capacity, entrances were shut down by the fire inspector, Stiers said. Some students who were not admitted to the event watched the show from the second and third levels of McCarthy Parking Structure.  
“We’ve worked really closely with DPS … They vet all of our artists and they provide the security they think is necessary for the event and we worked really closely with USC Fire Safety to make sure the quad is safe for attendees,” Stiers said. 
Stiers said Concerts Committee typically does not confirm artists until the week before the event due to logistical issues. Before securing an artist Stiers said they must address risk management and insurance issues and have the performers approved by the University.

USC’s decision to bring Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass to campus as the speaker for its 136th annual commencement ceremony on May 10 has been met with mixed responses from students. 
Bass has a graduate degree from the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and has worked at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Bass also established the Community Coalition in South Los Angeles, an organization aimed at transforming the neighborhood by improving public policy.
Some students say Bass, who represents the district that includes the University Park Campus, is too partisan to be the speaker, while others believe her ties to the USC community make her a perfect fit.
USC GOP Vice President Austin MacLeod, a senior majoring in international relations, said he believes the school should have chosen a more prominent figure, such as a politician in the executive branch.
“I think there’s something more interesting about that than a congresswoman who a lot of people have not heard of, particularly people outside of California,” MacLeod said. 
MacLeod said he believes Bass is a suitable campus speaker, but not for the commencement. 
“I believe that there’s more interesting people for commencement speaker, generally speaking … than a politician of any party,” MacLeod said. 
Trojan Advocates for Political Progress President Alec Vandenberg said he thinks students of all political affiliations can learn a lot from Bass, who also chairs the Congressional Black Caucus. 
“I think it’s really important that we keep up this relationship with our federal officials, especially [those] who work in our own backyard,” said Vandenberg, a junior majoring in public policy. “I’m excited because Karen Bass has been a prudent supporter and champion of many of the issues I find important.” 
Bass, who is currently serving in her fifth congressional term, is also chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Bass has been a strong advocate for gun control and criminal justice reforms and serves as a ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Ben Pearce, political director of USC College Democrats, said Bass and other commencement speakers should be judged by the quality of their speeches rather than their professions or political affiliations.
“If your organization believes in freedom of speech, and you are willing to defend having different voices on campus, then surely you shouldn’t object to a commencement speaker who is inherently political,” said Pearce, a sophomore majoring in public policy.
Political Student Assembly director Briana Miles, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, said she doesn’t think the party of the commencement speaker matters as long as they have a connection to the USC community.
“Either way [a speaker will] have something great to say, but I don’t think the party should be necessarily that much of a problem,” Miles said. “If a Republican represented the district, I think it would be appropriate to bring him as well.” 
Alex Hatem, a fifth-year doctoral candidate in geological sciences, said she believes the University’s decision to bring Bass to campus shows the administration’s desire to “push the envelope.” 
“I think a very neutral stance would be [bringing] somebody from their cohort of inner circle of board members,” Hatem said. “But to go and get a Democratic representative and black woman [is] like a stock that we’re putting in.”

United Airlines offered Friday to withdraw from the $69 million deal that would rename the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. The new name was made in agreement with USC as part of the $270 million renovation that was announced last year.
Upon the announcement that the Coliseum would be renamed, the airline faced criticism. Given that the Coliseum’s original name has honored World War I troops, critics said that a corporate name would be a disrespectful alternative.
United Airlines California president Janet Lamkin wrote in a letter to USC official Todd Dickey that the company is willing to take heed to the criticism.
“If USC is not in a position to honor the terms of the agreement, including in particular the name change, United would be amenable to abiding by the wishes of the community, stepping away from this partnership with USC and mutually terminating the agreement,” Lamkin wrote.
However, Lamkin wrote that the name change remained crucial to the agreement and had good intentions.
“From United’s perspective, the agreed-upon new name is the key provision of our sponsorship agreement with USC, underscoring our deep commitment to the community and its cherished institutions,” Lamkin wrote.
The University released a statement Friday evening saying that it would be willing to explore a modified name change.
“USC would be amenable to accepting the wishes of the veteran community to modify the proposed naming agreement to United Airlines Field at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum if United Airlines is agreeable to that name change and the resulting modification to the naming rights agreement,” the statement read.
In an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times on Monday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn criticized the new name, claiming that the Coliseum had special significance that would . 
“Unlike other modern sports venues, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is not just a stadium — it is a war memorial,” Hahn wrote. “Removing ‘Los Angeles’ and replacing it with a corporate sponsor insults the memories of those the Coliseum was intended to honor.”
