Content warning: This article contains discussions of suicide and mental health.
This past week, USC and Southern California at large witnessed a sequence of unprecedented, erratic climate events: A record-breaking heatwave was cut short by heavy rain and gusty winds, marking the side effects of Tropical Storm Kay’s landfall in Baja, California at hurricane strength. Such climate events are also public health events, said Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday. 
“As we see severe climate events, the impact on human health is going to be significant,” Van Orman said. “In the U.S., [there are] thousands of deaths every year from heat-related illness, and heat-related illness actually kill more people than cold-related illnesses … So there is a direct physical impact.”
Van Orman also said air pollution contributed to physical impacts. During the heatwave, the South Coast Air Quality Management District issued an ozone advisory effective Aug. 30 to Sept. 4, tweeting that “elevated smog levels [are] expected as high temperatures are predicted to persist through the week.”
Even more important, however, are the impacts on mental health.
“The climate catastrophe we find ourselves in really does impact people’s well-being,” Van Orman said, “both on an immediate basis — that feeling of being uncomfortable, unable to engage in normal activities — as well as just the trauma of … the climate event. Those larger issues we can’t solve, but we really want people to acknowledge and talk about them.”
Van Orman said Student Health has expanded its mental health services over the past week — including the launch of the “My Mental Health Assessment” project, a screening program for USC students hosted by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Other services currently provided through Student Health include the Crisis Text Line — “TROJAN” to 741741 — and the “Let’s Talk” program. Student Health provided a longer list of available services in a Sept. 6 community-wide email acknowledging World Suicide Prevention Day.
“In general, there are lots of things we can do to prevent [suicide],” Van Orman said. “That’s part of the conversation we want to have on our campus. Some of it is about having access to mental health services. A lot of it is also about [encouraging] everyone to feel that, if they see someone they know that’s struggling, and if they’re worried about a friend or colleague, we have some tools on our website on how to have a simple conversation with them … It makes a huge difference.”
Those who may not feel comfortable having a direct conversation can engage anonymously with the “Trojans Care for Trojans” program for help connecting to resource offices. Van Orman said she also encourages students to check if they have an embedded mental health counselor within their respective college.
During the briefing Tuesday, Van Orman also discussed the state of the coronavirus pandemic at USC, noting that cases are continuing to decline week after week: Between Sept. 5 and Sept. 11, 73 people tested positive at Student Health and 146 self-reported testing positive — totalling 219 reported positive cases. The week before, there were 449 total positive cases; the week before that, 561.
“We’re hopeful that that means that we’re entering a period where we’ll have less COVID infections,” Van Orman said. “It remains challenging, both within [Los Angeles County] and at the University, because so much of the testing is self-testing at this point. We really are relying on people to let us know when they test positive, so that then we can let other people know.”
Van Orman said the possibility of another coronavirus wave remains “difficult to predict,” but that the University will follow the L.A. County Department of Public Health’s guidance, should there be a drastic increase in hospitalizations and deaths.
“We know, predictably, we have surges after break periods,” Van Orman said. “Mid-term break [and] Thanksgiving break are going to be times that we’re going to watch very closely.”
In the meantime, Student Health continues to recommend that people stay home when they feel sick, and that people at high risk or experiencing symptoms wear masks.
Updated coronavirus boosters are available through USC Pharmacies, as of Tuesday, and at other retail pharmacies. Influenza vaccines are also available. Van Orman said that while vaccination against influenza is not required as it was last year, it remains important.
“The normal seasonality of the flu has really changed for the past couple of years,” Van Orman said. “We’re not sure what’s going to happen; we haven’t had the normal kind of immunity that builds as flu moves to the population. We are already seeing flu [infections], which is very, very early. And we also have a lot of people who just haven’t had the flu.”
Individuals with monkeypox are no longer required to isolate the full 21 to 28 days, but only for the first week wherein lesions and rashes persist and cannot be covered.

The School of Pharmacy announced in August the establishment of the education program Rising STARS — Scientific Training in Alcohol Research and other Substances — which intends to expose undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to interdisciplinary opportunities in addiction science. The program will be a partnership between USC, California State University, Los Angeles and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. Rising STARS is currently accepting applications for its first cohort.
Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education at the USC School of Pharmacy and professor of clinical pharmacy Daryl Davies is an associate director of the USC Institute for Addiction Science and the principal investigator for Rising STARS. Davies was inspired to begin Rising STARS after discovering that undergraduate students have little research opportunities, which limits their ability to choose a graduate program that suits their interests.  
“[Rising STARS] gives them all the hands-on experience to be successful and jump right into a graduate or Ph.D. program,” Davies said, referring to the research experience, workshops and career building activities Rising STARS scholars will engage in. 
Workshops during the school year may be completed in-person or remotely, allowing Rising STARS scholars at CSULA and CDU flexibility in completing the program. Workshops will cover a variety of topics to prepare students for their future higher education, including resume writing sessions. Scholars will also have the opportunity to work in USC labs during the summer. 
Rising STARS will consist of approximately 80 faculty members from various schools, including the School of Pharmacy, the Keck School of Medicine of USC and the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, who will mentor scholars during their program term. Rising STARS will use an interdisciplinary approach to expose scholars to a variety of approaches to studying addiction science and allow scholars to explore the approach they are interested in. 
Terry David Church, an assistant professor of regulatory and quality sciences, runs the educational component of Rising STARS. Church said he expects the program to begin with approximately 50 scholars and expand over time.
“We have to use skills outside of our academic discipline to investigate the issue of addiction,” Church said. “We expose [students] to different ways of looking at information to have the best tools.”
Chief Programs and Communications Officer for the USC Institute for Addiction Science Vickie Williams facilitates addiction science operations at USC, and said she hopes students from different disciplines will collaborate in Rising STARS.
“We want to cultivate talents of very motivated undergraduate, underrepresented, minority students and give them an opportunity to be a part of a really great training opportunity,” Williams said. “Whether that’s in pre-clinical laboratories, public health policy — anything that focuses on addiction science.” 
Davies emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to addiction science. Research projects require support from experts in a variety of fields to be completed and using a holistic approach to addiction science allows for students to have a better understanding of the field and work easily in teams. 
“Understanding addiction is going to take perspectives from around the academic table,” Church said. “There are so many things that addiction touches.” 
The Rising STARS program was awarded a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse — the first of its kind to enhance diversity in addiction science in the nation — to assist with educational efforts. It will be distributed to the program over approximately a five-year time frame, which will support two cohorts of scholars for two-year terms. 
Church said studying addiction science is important because, as time progresses, new compounds and drugs are created. Some drugs have the potential to be highly addictive and must be studied at the molecular and societal levels to prevent addiction.
“Addiction spans a gamut of subjects,” Williams said, noting that sources of addiction are plenty and diverse. “There’s opioids, intravenous injectable drugs, social media, phones and dietary addictions.”
Rising STARS intends to give underrepresented students the opportunity to be innovative, creative and flexible, Davies said. 
“The goal is to really bring people in and help develop their creativity and also push forward their desire, interest and understanding of what addiction science really entails,” Church said. “Through their participation, [students] will hopefully be able to help us solve a lot of problems we’ve encountered in addiction, in terms of making sure we have good programs for treatment, research and care.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Daryl Davies is the associate dean for undergraduate education at California State University, Los Angeles. Davies is the associate dean for undergraduate education at the University of Southern California’s School of Pharmacy. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed a revised meal plan donation program and yearly goals, and called for working action regarding Greek life disaffiliation at Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
Senator Aidan Feighery presented amendments to resolutions concerning disaffiliated fraternities to protect vulnerable student groups, namely freshmen and transfers. 
This comes after ten of fifteen USC fraternities having publicly denounced affiliation with the school at the time of publication, forming the independent University Park Interfraternity Council. 
Feighery has co-sponsored the four amendments — which call on the University to study the ramifications of disaffiliation, host town hall events and generate more information regarding disaffiliation for both students and parents — with Senator Nayva Singh, who was absent from the night’s meeting. 
“I’ve had discussions with University administrators, such as the head of fraternities and leadership development,” Feighery said. “Every single item that we’ve listed in the results section is something that we know is actionable for the University and that’s something that we’ve had conversations [about] in order to make sure it’s possible.”
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon presented recent and upcoming events put on by USG affiliates: Both the Transfer Study Assembly and Political Student Assembly will host general meetings this Wednesday for students who are interested. 
Senator Yoav Gillath discussed his yearly goals, including the distribution of sunscreen and menstrual products to unhoused individuals.
By working with Cathartic — a nonprofit that connects donors of health necessities with suppliers that can help those in need within the community — and other campus organizations, including Alpha Phi Omega, Delta Phi Epsilon and the Environmental Student Assembly, Gillath said he hopes to continue “giving back to the community.” 
Gillath said he plans to help reinstate the meal plan donation program in adjustment to the revised meal plan put in place for the 2022-23 academic year. USC Hospitality enacted several changes from last year’s meal plan, which was changed during the coronavirus pandemic to a 19 meal-swipe limit per week under the Cardinal Meal Plan. The plan now offers students unlimited meal swipes per week at the three residential dining halls, meaning students have no unused swipes at the end of each week to donate.
Last semester’s meal plan donation pilot program raised $12,000 — funds that were subsequently directed to Student Basic Needs. 
“I’m hoping that we can continue that program and make it permanent in the long term … but that’s contingent on us being able to work with USC Hospitality and USC Basic Needs,” Gillath said. 
Gilath also intends to spearhead a centralized reporting form for all types of complaints, including Title IX and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
“We want [complaints] all to be in a centralized location [so] that whenever students need it, it’s easy to find,” Gillath said.
Chief of staff Diego Andrades shared last week’s involvement fair recruitment metrics and spoke to the changing post-coronavirus pandemic office culture. Forty-four open positions were offered by various USG branches last week, for which over 150 applicants applied. USG will begin interviewing applicants for those positions today and fully onboarding new staff next Tuesday. 
Following a change in location to a new shared space, new guest rules have been implemented for those interested in visiting the office. Beginning this year, non-USG-affiliated guests will be required to be escorted by an officer. 
“Recurring guests has been a bit of an issue with campus activities,” Andrades said. “At the end of the day, it’s a professional environment.”

Religion has played an ambiguous role in my life, more or less. Even in my immediate family, it’s a complicated topic. My dad’s side is Catholic and mom’s side is Buddhist. However, my parents themselves aren’t devout followers, so we almost never go to church — the last time was to attend my uncle’s wedding. At most, we visit a nearby Buddhist temple every other month to pray at the shrines and throw pennies at a bell for good luck (also as small donations). In other words, religion hasn’t played a huge part in my life — at least not directly.
In some ways, religion has been a constant force that I observe from halfway across the world on the news and in conversations with friends on a smaller scale. If you think about it, religion is inescapable. 
With some contemplation, I’ve concluded that one shouldn’t feel restricted by the permanence of religion. I mean, if you can’t get away from it, you might as well learn to coexist with it. Sometimes, religious viewpoints can seem irrational, especially if you think progressively. However, religious thought is generally well intended, and over time I’ve begun to appreciate it and have come to the belief that everyone should — even if you might not believe in it or agree with those following that faith. 
A deeply religious friend of mine once expressed that she is pro-life, but also believes that women should have control over their own bodies. I’ll admit it took me a second to process this, because to me, that was equivalent to saying she was a strict vegan but also believed in eating meat. But basically, she felt conflicted.
But, you see, as a Christian, she believes that passage into heaven is achieved by living as Jesus did, with good morals, which would include respecting the life and liberty of all beings. The issue is that in the case of banning abortion, life would be granted at the expense of liberty. 
Now you might argue that pro-life advocates generally attribute their stance to religious beliefs, and that’s true in my friend’s case.  But remember that virtually every text ever written can be interpreted in various ways — and with centuries of mistranslation, who knows what original religious texts may have said. Opinions on controversial topics (yes, even religion itself) are shaped by many variables in one’s life, so even if one consults a spiritual leader, their guidance is given based on that leader’s own personal understanding of the religious doctrine. Besides, just as it’s wrong to assume that an Asian peer is great at math because of his race (granted some branches openly preach against abortion) Christian pro-life advocates shouldn’t be assumed to hold their opinions because of their religion.
In the end, even the Bible doesn’t specify rules for multifaceted and controversial topics such as abortion. In my friend’s case, religion guided her to support the most moral outcomes, which were unfortunately contradictory. Ultimately, the side that she takes is based on her personal priorities and reasoning. 
Moral crises aside, I still believe that religion, when practiced as intended, has the power to uplift society. Of course, I can’t speak for all faiths, but in general, the idea of rewarding the good and punishing the bad is encouraged. Regardless of your faith, and even if you’re non-religious, we’ve all had this moral compass ingrained in our minds. The way I imagine it, religion is that small voice in everyone’s head that guides our judgment on ethics. With it, we’re encouraged to hold ourselves to a higher standard.
In contemplating my own beliefs and that of others, I prefer to view religion as a philosophy rather than faith. I may not spend Sunday mornings at church, fast for certain parts of the year or embark on pilgrimages, but I live with awareness of my actions. In this way, even agnostics and atheists can appreciate religion, because it’s no longer about worshiping. Rather, religion becomes a matter of living with a healthy conscience. 
Unfortunately, people of different religions often forget the core purpose of their belief system. Focused on serving a higher being, they begin to invalidate other religions, which makes religion a touchy subject when everyone is just trying to understand the meaning of their existence. Not to mention the fact that we all have the right to freedom of thought and religion as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Nonetheless, many fall into the trap of using their religion as an excuse to impose their beliefs onto others. In one such case, the parent of a student attending West Potomac High School in Fairfax County, Virginia “threatened to go to the school board with a formal complaint,” because a teacher was explaining Hinduism in a public school. Even at the mention of another religion, people become defensive, which is the attitude that divides society. Moreover, Hinduism had been mentioned in a chapter about various religions, so the parent’s specific complaint about Hinduism was simply discriminatory. The teacher was simply teaching what all teachers should teach — history and cultures from multiple global perspectives. 
Every religion has its quirks, and unless its practices are hostile, appreciating them is a matter of being open-minded enough to see the good intentions. Besides, showing loyalty to your faith doesn’t have to be outwardly shown to be sincere. Practicing religion and preaching the ideals is helpful to all, but crossing that boundary to force your beliefs onto another is contrary to religion’s purpose. It sounds ironic, but those boundaries keep us together and foster a moral and inclusive environment. And quite frankly, do you think higher beings enjoy seeing their disciples get into heated arguments and burning bridges?
Regardless of your religious upbringing, remember that other religions preach the same core values. We are all working towards the same goal of improving society and that goal would be a lot easier to achieve if we are accepting of each other’s personal beliefs. So by all means, keep doing you, and remember to allow others to do the same.

Cesar Chavez — everyone knows the name. Regardless of ethnicity, the name “Cesar Chavez,” at the very least, rings a bell for most Americans. As one of the most influential and undoubtedly celebrated Latino figures, Chavez’s accomplishments on behalf of field workers are undeniable — from creating union contracts for field workers in writing to establishing health benefits for workers and their families and co-founding the National Farm Workers Association.
With Hispanic Heritage Month on the horizon, I thought there would be no better time to discuss the complicated legacy of the beloved Cesar Chavez and what it means for the Hispanic community today.
Chavez rose to prevalence in the early ‘60s following the establishment of the NFWA, and soon after led major strikes in McFarland and Porterville, California in 1965. From there, his popularity skyrocketed because of his advocacy and approach to non-violent protest. Incredibly, substantial progress was made by 1966 when his first labor agreement was signed — and this progress only continued to snowball into major successes for him and other farm workers over the next decade.
When I was in school, this was essentially the history lesson I learned when it came to Chavez. I learned that he was “good.” As embarrassing as it is to admit, I accepted this as fact and didn’t learn about the unsavory side of his contributions to history until I was a teenager. 
Marshall Ganz, a man who worked alongside Chavez as a United Farm Workers organizer for over a decade, remembers him in a complicated light — “heroic” but also someone who fell into “paranoid perception” during his time with UFW. Ganz recalls Chavez’s experiments with “The Game” — a tactic used to enforce loyalty by means of public humiliation of those who betrayed him. 
To my extreme surprise, Chavez was also notably hateful towards undocumented immigrants. Despite claiming in a 1974 edition of the San Francisco Examiner that he “recognize[s] the illegals as [their] brothers and sisters,” his retort after other UFW members, such as co-founder Dolores Huerta, asked him to consider using more sensitive language when regarding undocumented individuals suggests otherwise. “You [Chicano liberals] get these hang-ups…” Chavez said. “They’re wets, you know. They’re wets, and let’s go after them,” as documented in Miriam Pawel’s book “The Crusades of Cesar Chavez: A Biography.” 
Not a good look at all — and that’s not even going into detail about how he encouraged his followers to call immigration on undocumented individuals, praised Ferdinand Marcos’ cruel regime in the Philipines or how he compared the farm workers he once held in high regard as greedy “pigs”.
I was equal parts embarrassed and disillusioned that he wasn’t the saint or martyr that I thought he was, which inadvertently proves my own point. Chavez was once a man, not just a historical figure. Heck, my dad met him casually in the ‘80s and said he was a chill guy, just like anyone else!  So why are we so afraid to admit that being a three-dimensional person with moments of failure and having a positive influence on history aren’t mutually exclusive?
Unfortunately, it has become incredibly normalized to keep prominent figures on high pedestals that not even they can reach and proceed to be shocked when they disappoint us. At this point, cropping out parts of someone’s identity or history to make it more palatable is pointless — especially considering how easy it is to find out the whole truth online these days. The bottom line is that whatever questionable choices or statements Chavez has made, it certainly does not negate the total net good he has had for a substantial group of people. Life isn’t black and white, so why does history have to be?
With representation being as scarce as it already is, it’s understandably painful to acknowledge the shortcomings of one of the few notable Hispanic figures that everyone is familiar with. Even though he was a rather questionable individual, Cesar Chavez was also someone precious to fellow Chicanos for the strides he made.

Every time Mercury retrograde rolls around, even I, a self-proclaimed astrology connoisseur, am skeptical of whether it truly affects anything. But sure enough, since the start of Mercury retrograde on Sept. 9, multiple friends have told me about past relationships and friendships coming back into their lives. I keep hearing songs that remind me of things that happened in high school and the campus WiFi keeps cutting out whenever I get into a homework groove. On my way back from the football game at Stanford this weekend, my group’s car broke down, and we were stranded in Middle-of-Nowhere, California for six hours.
When a planet is in retrograde, it’s either moving backwards or has the illusion of moving backwards. When Earth and another planet — in this case Mercury — have different orbits, it creates this fateful optical illusion. This month, Mercury is moving backwards from Libra to Virgo instead of the regular Libra to Scorpio transition. Since Mercury is the fastest orbiting planet in the solar system, Mercury retrograde happens more than any other planet’s retrograde — about four times a year, spanning three weeks each time. 
Mercury is the planet of communication, travel and technology. During this time, you may run into more technological issues or find it harder to articulate your thoughts. Relationships may falter as healthy communication crumbles. You may desperately need to send a text to a friend only to have your service cut out. 
Libra is the sign of a social butterfly, meaning this retrograde has an extra emphasis on relationships, whether they be romantic, platonic or school-related. On Sept. 23, Mercury shifts into Virgo and the retrograde will be (kind of) over. Virgo is related to structure and organization, so everything will feel a lot more grounded with time. Retrogrades have a “shadow period” before and after the backward motion begins. So if you’ve been feeling a little off this semester, that might be because this retrograde’s shadow period started Aug. 21. Unfortunately, it won’t be over until Oct. 17, so hang in there. 
As we start to feel the effects of the Mercury retrograde that started Sept. 9, here’s a rundown of what it means for you.
The sky is divided into 12 houses, each ruling a different area of life. Knowing your rising sign, the sign that you come across as when someone first meets you, (which you can find through an online birth chart calculator) tells you what house Mercury will be in during this retrograde, and therefore what areas may bring you the most turmoil in the coming weeks. You can also look at your Mercury or sun signs (your sun sign is the sign you likely know and look at when you read your horoscope), as similar themes may also apply. 
Aries
Aries will particularly have trouble with partnerships at the start of Mercury retrograde. When retrograde ends, it is important to rebuild connections with yourself through healthy habits and self care. Basically, love yourself before you love someone else, Aries. 
Taurus
Tauruses may have a hard time settling into a routine this month, but it is important to take time for yourself as much as possible. On Sept. 23, you will find yourself settling back into your creative nature and finding time to pick up hobbies you may have lost touch with during the retrograde. 
Gemini
Geminis may also have a hard time getting creative juices flowing and may also experience difficulties and miscommunications in romantic relationships. As the retrograde ends, focus on creating a calming home environment. It might be time to invest in some candles, some calming lighting, plants and anything else that makes you feel at home. Also make sure to keep in touch with your family and hometown friends. 
Cancer 
Cancer, you may face difficulties with your household chores this month. Make sure to communicate with your roommates and get on top of any cleaning before it becomes unmanageable. Coming out of retrograde, you may find that your communication challenges become triumphs, and you’ll actually thrive in this department. 
Leo
More than other signs, you will face communication challenges this season, Leo. Be sure to keep your electronics charged and proofread before you send an email. When Mercury enters your house of finances and possessions, you may find positive changes in your career. It also may be a good time to enter raffles and play in the lottery, just make sure to wait until the shadow period ends on Oct. 7 to do so. 
Virgo
Keep a tight hold on your possessions, make sure you’re locking your doors and make sure the person you trust to watch your stuff in the library is actually paying attention. It also may be wise to refrain from making any investments until the retrograde ends. Mercury enters your sign on the 23rd, so this will be prime time for self-reflection. Take a few minutes when you can to journal, you might be surprised at what you find. 
Libra
The next couple of months will be intense for Libra placements. Mercury is in retrograde in your house of the self, and moves into your house of spirituality and healing at the end of the month. Now is a time to look inward and reflect as much as possible. After Sept. 23, you may see some rapid changes in your self growth. While it may be intense, don’t resist it. 
Scorpio
Scorpio placements may have a difficult time in regards to growth this month. Focus on your daily routine and don’t try to force too much self-reflection. At the end of retrograde, you may find you have a stronger sense of community in places you weren’t even looking. Lean into this.  
Sagittarius
You may feel a little isolated during this retrograde and may find yourself running into obstacles when trying to make social plans. Although frustrating for the social Sagittarius, remember to make time for yourself. By the month’s end, you’ll be more secure in your school work and social standing and find it easier to balance these different aspects of your life.
Capricorn
Capricorns will face difficulties in their strong suit of work ethic this month. Remember that it’s okay to take a break or go out every now and then. At retrograde’s end, you may find an exciting travel opportunity presented to you or another new experience. 
Aquarius
I’m surprised I’m not an Aquarius rising, because your car could definitely break down during this retrograde. Be sure to fill up on gas, arrive at the airport early and take other precautions if you are planning on traveling this month. When Mercury moves into Virgo, you will experience a major transformation as a result of what you learned during the retrograde.
Pisces
Pisces like to find comfort in daydreaming, but that may be difficult for you this month as your schedule gets busier. Channel your creative energy into your work, you may be pleased at what comes from it. When retrograde ends, you may find new friendships or romantic relationships that can help foster your creativity.

Guests were welcomed into a dimly-lit Bovard Auditorium as a lively crowd thrummed with excitement and anticipation for the USC Thornton Symphony’s opening concert Friday. 
With just one look at the Sept. 9 program, it is easy to see why the symphony’s first concert had an exceptional turnout — including stand out suites like “Daphnis et Chloé, Suite No. 2” by Maurice Ravel and “Pictures at an Exhibition” by Modest Mussorgsky. 
The evening started off strong as guests were greeted immediately with a sleepy, fairytale-like introduction from the woodwind section and lower strings. Before the audience became aware, multiple layers of moving lines were added on top of the slow accompaniment with a whirlwind of sounds within the symphony. Just as quickly as it was introduced, the heavy layers dissipated and focused onto the shimmering flute and clarinet soloists, Lindsay Bryden and Ray Wyant.
While the soloists remained focused, they were continually supported by the entire strings section who littered the background with beautiful, emotional swells. Seamlessly, the strings took the foreground and delivered multiple mini-build ups that eventually climaxed to the audience right around the third minute as the music subtly transitioned into a quicker-paced, more dramatic theme.
The symphony entered a more sparsely orchestrated part led by the haunting and repetitive oboe line, which quickly lended itself to a shy woodwind and string interlude in the sixth minute. Surprisingly, this initially dense movement closed with a final, unsure-sounding clarinet solo. The second movement, “Pantomime,” was consumed by an elegant flute solo which challenged its unsure beginnings; the solo dominated the score, and impressively, the clean flute runs established a rather mischievous theme for the midsection. “Pantomime” finished off with romantic, symphony-wide chords before it abruptly began the chaotic-sounding “Danse générale.”
After the initial plunge into the third and final movement, the music rapidly descended into a tragic-sounding theme before it quickly snapped the audience into a fast-paced march, marked by insane runs in the greater woodwind section and a militant-sounding accompaniment in the brass, lower strings and percussion. In a dizzying change of pace, “Danse générale” could not have been more different than its two predecessors — a hectic movement delineated by amazing dynamic control, exhilarating themes, and overall incredible musicianship; this is exactly what live classical music is about.
“Promenade 1” opened with a confident and gallant trumpet solo by principal player on the piece, Ben Gunnarson. In a call and response pattern, the soloist’s phrase was echoed by the rest of the brass and lower strings/woodwinds, and then combined into the gentle melodies of the string section.
Just as one settled into the primary motif, the lower strings did an impressive job of blindsiding the audience by introducing the deeply unsettling phrase that stalks this movement throughout. Continuing with the heaviness that was previously established, somehow the music became darker, and the symphony succeeded in delivering a sense of uneasiness and edge with the strings chromatically slinking downward while the brass reinforced the eerie melody.
“Promenade 2” started with a solo by Sussannah Greenslit, principal french horn player on the Mussorgsky. She played a lovely reprise of the original trumpet solo as she was echoed by light orchestration in the woodwinds. A calmer air settled on the symphony, as this movement, titled “The Old Castle,” was characterized by a sound that can only be described as antique. 
In “Tuileries,’’ the symphony began a cheery uptick in tempo and range that primarily took place in the upper register of the woodwind and string sections. However, this brief interlude was succeeded by a positively glowing solo by euphonium player Arisa Makita in “Bydło.” In a clear and commanding performance, Makita’s solo provided passage to the forthcoming free, rolling string melodies.
What was most enjoyable about the last movements was certainly how eccentric each one was in its own right, from “Limoges,” the fast and technically-exhausting favorite, to “Catacombs,” where the brass section was devastatingly intense. However, nothing can beat the ninth and tenth movements, “The Hut on Fowl’s Legs” and “The Great Gate of Kiev” — an all-encompassing and fitting ending. With enormous runs that swept through the symphony along with a fully-realized rendition of the theme, they were nothing short of a truly glorious suite.
The musicians were met with a rousing — and seemingly endless — standing ovation that conveyed a job well done; following recognition of the soloists, conductor Carl St. Clair thanked the audience for their attendance and encouraged them to consider future Thornton concerts. Stepping out into the light showers of the evening, a collective sense of contentment and a night well-spent fell over attendees, as they exited Bovard Auditorium after an excellent opening performance.

After falling behind in the first half, the USC Women’s soccer team battled back to secure a tie 1-1 against University of Nebraska-Lincoln Sunday afternoon.
“It’s one of those games where a tie feels more like a loss, so I think we’re taking it pretty hard,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. “It’s a game we felt we needed to win and wanted to win, and it didn’t go our way today.”
Nebraska secured the lead late in the first-half after sophomore forward Abbey Schwarz scored in the 37th minute. The Trojans struggled with their own shooting in the first half, totaling only 6 shots compared to Nebraska’s 11.
“Nebraska does a good job of just making the game really disruptive in the air, lots of fouls, very physical. We were hoping to be able to settle the game, keep it on the ground and play a little more soccer, but there were a lot of moments that required us just to outwork them,” Alukonis said. “The game was very disruptive and just a tough one to play.”
Despite the low number of first half shots and overwhelming physical play by the Huskies, who committed 10 first half fouls, the game was closer than it may have seemed.
“We talk a lot about the quality of shots,” Alukonis said. “Sometimes Nebraska does put a lot of shots on the board, but it doesn’t always necessarily mean that they were closer to scoring.”
After a halftime adjustment, the Trojans began attacking the goal more, outshooting Nebraska 11-5 in the final 45 minutes and totaling 9 shots on goal to Nebraska’s 3 over the course of the game.
“We talked to our team a lot about making sure our chances are quality,” Aluknois said. “We had to go a little more direct and chase the game, and I thought we were successful in what we tried to employ, apart from a couple that were offside or didn’t quite finish.”
The Trojan’s direct play paid off as sophomore forward Simone Jackson found the back of the net in the 54th minute, scoring off an assist by senior midfielder Croix Bethune. With the goal, Jackson extended her scoring streak to three consecutive games.
“Simone has done really well getting on the board, game after game,” Alukonis said. “In terms of getting into the positions  we wanted to, I thought that we were fairly successful.”
However, despite the increased shot volume in the second half, the Trojan’s failed to convert any of their chances into a game winner.
“I think we created, but some of our best chances were called offsides,” Alukonis revealed. The Trojans were called offside three times throughout the game. “Overall, we just needed one or two of those to go our way but didn’t have the luck today.”
On top of the stress of two separate road games in four days, USC is also attempting to deal with the constant shuffling of their roster as players leave and return from tours with their national teams. 
“While it’s really nice to have a lot of players back, sometimes you don’t quite know how long they will be able to play for or at what level they are able to perform, just based on everything their bodies have gone through recently” Alukonis said. “It’s nice to have more options, but we also have to reintegrate them into the team.”
After a long weekend of play, the Trojans have three days to rest before they return to action against UC Irvine Thursday afternoon.
“Always, our focus is outworking the other team, creating more chances, putting goals away, and trying to deny any opportunity of danger from them,” Alukonis said. “We are aware of the level that Irvine is, and it’s going to be a tough one, but we will work as hard as we possibly can to get the result.”
The Trojans look to claim victory as they return home against UC Irvine at Soni McAlister Field on Sept. 15 at 3:00 pm.

What a week of college football. An opening weekend void of surprise was clearly just the calm before the storm that was this weekend’s results. On Saturday, the upsets came quick and early, exposing glaring weaknesses in some of college football’s most feared teams. USC is notably absent from this list.
It would not have surprised any longtime USC football fan if the Trojans had the same fate as University of Notre Dame and Texas A&M University this week, both of which were upset by unranked teams. USC has had trouble in Palo Alto for years, and were 4-5 in the last 9 matchups before winning 41-28 this weekend.
 After watching Lincoln Riley’s offense in full force, it is clear to see that this season is different. In its current form, any Pac-12 opponent will have major difficulties keeping up with the pace and tenacity of USC’s offense. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and junior wide receiver Jordan Addison’s connection looked telepathic (Heisman watch?) as they shredded the trees into wood chips. The duo connected for 2 touchdowns and averaged 24.6 yards per reception. 
Despite the fireworks on offense, it was hard to ignore USC’s abysmal run defense. Luckily, the Trojans got bailed out by Stanford’s absurd turnover problem, two of which occurred within the 5-yard line. While some pundits blamed USC’s spotty defense on the injury of freshman cornerback Domani Jackson, I think there is a more systemic issue that could lead to losses unless the Trojan offense can consistently score 60 points a week.
 For now, Trojan fans should celebrate the first conference win of the Lincoln Riley era and hope the defensive struggles are just growing pains, which are not irregular for a team full of transfers that had only played one game together. 
While USC, now ranked No. 7, did not have their prowess tested by Stanford, other major programs faced headwinds across the country. 
As USC’s most ardent fans traveled north, I went south hoping to witness one of those upsets myself as No. 1 ranked University of Alabama traveled to Texas. I’ve never seen Head Coach Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide play scared in my entire life, but Alabama looked like underdogs in the face of 105,213 fans at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium (which was an attendance record). Alabama junior linebacker Will Anderson Jr., even called the atmosphere at DKR the “loudest environment [he’s] experienced” in his illustrious college career. 
After many forecasters predicted a 20+ point blowout Alabama victory for weeks, Texas held Alabama to 20 points, losing just 20-19 despite missing a 20-yard field goal and losing their starting quarterback in the first quarter. 
Texas showed they have the talent and passion to join the ranks of the NCAA Southeastern Conference Football in the next few years as planned. The College Football Playoff’s board of managers unanimously voted to implement a 12-team playoff starting in 2026 after years of complaints about the current format. This decision is partially related to the will of fans who are tired of seeing the same teams — Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio State — make the playoffs every year. 
Critics argued that SEC and Big Ten brass will be the last teams standing in an event and expanding the playoffs just elongates the process. However, after this week, I’m not so sure.
 Auburn University and  University of Tennessee, Knoxville almost lost to teams that are mediocre at best, and Texas A&M lost to Appalachian State University. 
If Texas A&M can lose to Appalachian State — a team that was supposed to lose so badly that they got paid 1.5 million to come to College Station — then there’s nothing stopping elite programs like USC from benefiting from an expanded playoff table and making a run to the national championship game. 
This week of college football was profoundly entertaining, but it also provided a much needed reminder to some disgruntled fans that anything can happen and that no amount of five-star recruits or NIL money can immunize teams from an upset. 
Ethan Horowitz is a junior writing about the ever-changing college football landscape. His column “The End Zone” runs every other Tuesday (except for this week).
