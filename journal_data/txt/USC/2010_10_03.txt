Before reaching for that can of soda, consider that the carbonated beverage  may actually cause pain, according to researchers at USC.
On Sept. 29, The Journal of Neuroscience published a study conducted by USC professor Emily Liman that says the consumption of carbonated beverages triggers electrical impulses in our body that cause small amounts of pain.
A rather serendiptous moment in her laboratory led Liman to explore the interaction between pain and soda.
“We had one student in the lab working on molecules involved in mustard detection and one student who was working on responses to acids by taste cells. One day we took the solutions from the mustard detection and applied them to the taste cells,” Liman said.
The two graduate students involved, Yuanyuan Wang and Rui Chang, continued to assist Professor Liman throughout the progression of the study.
Liman said the sensory perception that one experiences when drinking soda is first sourness and then a burning sensation.
It was previously thought that this burning sensation was caused by the chemical nature of the carbonation, particularly the bubbles found in such beverages. The study, however, proves that it is the carbon dioxide within the composition that leads to the burning.
The study used the cells of mice that were taken from the part of the brain that contains pain sensory cells. The cells were then floated in carbonated saline to observe which ones reacted to the carbon dioxide.
“TRPA1 molecules sense mustard and other noxious chemicals. These cells have receptors in our nasal and oral cavities; mustard binds to these receptors caus[ing] the generation of the electrical impulse. The same was found in the case of carbon dioxide,” Liman said.
Liman said that even though the consumption of carbonated drinks causes pain and alerts our body to tissue damage, given the relatively small quantities of compounds within these drinks, tissue damage is unlikely to occur, even if someone is a regular soda drinker.
Chang said he doesn’t think this discovery will change students’ drinking habits.
“[The pain] is not expressed in the taste, there are other pathways in our body for us to feel like we’re drinking soda,” he said.
Sabrina Hsu, a sophomore majoring in psychology who said she is a regular soda drinker, said she doesn’t believe she will stop drinking soda.
“Generally people do what they want, regardless of what studies find,” Hsu said.

More than 100 students exhibited their entrepreneurial ideas Friday at the 2010 USC Student Innovator Showcase and Competition.
Think tank · Fifty-three teams of students from all majors displayed their work at the Student Innovator Showcase and Competition Friday. - Neha Jain | Daily Trojan 
The showcase, hosted by the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, was held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Von KleinSmid Center courtyard. The goal of the event was to give students from across the university, both graduates and undergraduates, the opportunity to present and explain their breakthrough ideas, said Dana Rygwelski, senior marketing coordinator at the Stevens Institute.
“The showcase is a great way to demonstrate the creative thinking that takes place here at USC and the research that is done to change our world and the future,” Rygwelski said.
The annual Student Innovator Showcase and Competition began in 2007 and has since become a part of Trojan Parents Weekend. All USC students were eligible to submit an application for the showcase. Overall, 87 teams applied, of which 53, consisting of more than 100 students, were chosen to exhibit their ideas.
The first-place team, winners of the Most Innovative Award, developed a web-based platform where users can view videos documenting local social problems and work together to generate new methods of approaching these problems. The creators named their platform Sangha, the Sanskrit word for community.
Sangha’s co-founders, Jesse Goldberg, Sarayu Ramanan, Zlatan Sehovic and Crystal Cheng, said they began their project in India before expanding it at USC.
“It’s really exciting. We worked on the idea for almost six months,” said Goldberg, a graduate student studying business administration. “There’s really big potential.”
The second-place team, Dish Dash, won the Most Promising Business Concept Award, a prize funded by the Diem Shotwell Metcalfe Family Fund at the USC Marshall School of Business.
Created by undergraduate students Michael Garrido, Tracy Lawrence, Maggy Wahba and Gary Yao, Dish Dash is an online and mobile student guide to dining discounts. By partnering with restaurants, the creators hope to bridge the gap between restaurants and USC students.
Participants said they were pleased with the feedback they received from those who visited the showcase.
“It means so much to a business that’s just starting,” said Lawrence, a senior majoring in business administration.
The first runner-up, Farhan Baluch, a fifth-year graduate student studying neuroscience, developed a system of using locusts as a biological sensor for high-speed mobile robots called Locus-Bot.
The second runner-up, Jona Xiao, a senior majoring in business administration and critical studies, developed the PlayDate Online Dating Game. The game is targeted at  young people, who want to find romance online without using sites such as Match.com. Users participate in a number of games, such as “Would You Rather,” to evaluate their own values and thought process.
Other ideas at the showcase included projects from detachable high heels to bicycles that could be transformed into their own locks.
“I really want to put this in the market,” said Winnie Lam, a junior majoring in industrial and systems enginnering and creator of the detachable high heel.
Lam said the showcase helped her determine who would be the target consumer for her product.
According to Rygwelski, the event generated interest from a very diverse student audience. The teams were composed of students from a number of USC’s schools.
“The participants are from all corners of the university,” Rygwelski said.
Representatives from the USC Stevens Institute, the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at USC and many field experts judged the event. Each judge spoke with all participants at the showcase to determine which projects would be selected for the 10 finalists.
These finalists were then invited to give two-minute pitches of their ideas in front of the panel of judges at Tommy Trojan later that day. From these speeches, judges selected the first-place winner, second-place winner and two runners-up. All four teams won cash prizes and a skateboard.
For many students who participated in the showcase, the potential for their ideas will expand because of the exposure.
“For the last three years, the three companies that have won have gone on to have business success,” Rygwelski said.
Richard Hull, the senior director of New Ventures and Alliances at the USC Stevens Institute and the master of ceremonies, said he believes USC students have the potential to dramatically change the way they live.
“USC students think big,” Hull said. “I think innovation is key to society in making an impact in people’s lives. This event is a great way to bring people together.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded USC’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events a $15.3 million grant to continue its anti-terrorism research and study natural disasters.
The center received the prize because of its success in finding cost-efficient ways to lower the probability and mitigate the ramifications of terrorism, according to CREATE Director Stephen Hora.
CREATE entered a nationwide competition this fall against several other university anti-terror research centers and was one of 12 to receive a government grant.
CREATE actually has less money, however, to work with from this grant, according to Adam Rose, CREATE Coordinator for Economics.
“Typically, we got $5 million a year,” Rose said.
The $15.3 million is a five-year grant, leaving CREATE with less money per year than before. Rose said this shortage was because of significant budget cuts in the Department of Homeland Security.
Hora said the organization plans to use the money to continue its research in economic and risk analysis.
“We must find better ways to estimate risks of terror and allocate resources to prevent or curtail terrorists,” Hora said.
CREATE, composed mainly of graduate students, professors and experts from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development, earned the grant because of several successful projects, Hora said.
One of the most notable was a defense system that saved airports $35 billion.
“Terrorists have these shoulder-launched missiles that can bring down airplanes,” Hora said.
Because the missiles are less accurate at longer ranges, CREATE’s solution was to expand the perimeter of the airport so that when airplanes are exposed they are higher in the sky, thus making them more difficult targets.
Isaac Maya, director of research for CREATE, helped pioneer Game-Theoretic Unpredictable and Randomly Deployed Security — another signature project concerned with deterring terrorists.
“Terrorists are adaptive adversaries that see what you’re doing and adopt strategies to attack you,” Maya said.
GUARDS counters terrorist threats by launching software containing specially designed algorithms to make patrols and Transportation Security Administration searches unpredictable enough so that terrorists are caught off-guard.
Another requirement of the grant was that recipients expand research to cover natural disasters as well as terrorism.
Rose said the organization plans to analyze the direct and indirect consequences of natural catastrophes like earthquakes and hurricanes.
He also seeks to analyze the behavior of people affected by biological contamination and discover methods to bolster the public’s resilience. Examples include having back-up electricity generators or promoting programs that allow private businesses to help troubled businesses relocate after a natural or man-made disaster.
“The key is to take the burden off the government and respond with the private sector,” Rose said.
CREATE was founded by Randolph Hall and  Detloff von Winterfeldt in 2004.  According to Hall, after competing against 72 universities that year, USC became the first Department of Homeland Security University Center of Excellence.
The interaction between USC faculty and students has proven to be a valuable asset toward finding ways to make the world more peaceful, Hall said.
CREATE plans to develop 26 new homeland security courses for students at USC. In the past, students working with CREATE have earned excellent positions in the Department of Homeland Security, Rose said.
“We have always had the goal to take an imaginative approach toward understanding terrorism so that we can better anticipate future risks and help the nation and the world become safer places,” Hall said.

The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has started the new academic year with the  goal of expanding its support base among USC communities.
The Queer and Ally Student Assembly has already hosted its welcome barbecue and a dance at Ground Zero Performance Cafè, but its vision for the rest of the year goes beyond events. QuASA started 2010 with a greater initiative: involving more people in its events, said Emily Allen, executive director of QuASA.
Katrina MacGregor | Daily Trojan
“My goal is for QuASA to bring all sorts of different people out to participate in the programming and activities, to show that you don’t have to be super involved in the community to get involved,” Allen said. “So I’m just trying to bring up the ideas of communities and support and a lot of different communities that have no relation to QuASA are doing that too.”
Although QuASA is happy to be a part of USC’s welcoming community, some students said they realize that QuASA is still viewed as a niche organization on campus.
“I feel welcome, and some of my friends who are straight feel welcome, but I know some people don’t even feel that they’re really invited,” said Willie Hartman, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts.
October is Coming Out month for the LGBT community. The theme of this year’s Coming Out month is “Melting Pot,” a title Allen said is designed to show that all types of campus cultures and communities can join together to support the LGBT community, and that diverse types of people can coexist and complement each other.
“It’s to bring about awareness to a larger group at USC, not just the LGBT community but everybody,” Allen said.
LGBT will kick off Coming Out month with a chocolate fountain and fondue in Alumni Park on Tuesday to emphasize the melting pot theme. Throughout October, LGBT will also be hosting events, such as karaoke night and a “Gay? Fine by Me” T-shirt giveaway.
Through Oct. 10, QuASA will be collecting photos of students holding signs reading “I am an Ally” as part of its biggest event, “Coming Out as an Ally.” These photos will be displayed on Trousdale Parkway to show that the support of the LGBT community is widespread, Allen said.
“This is the first time that we’re having Ally week as part of Coming Out month,” Allen said. “We’re just kind of opening up a demographic a little bit wider by really showing ally students that they too can be involved.”
QuASA’s long-term goals are to dispel the idea that the group is only open to certain people, Allen said, and to expand their programs to as many students as possible.
“The USC community has been so responsive and supportive whenever the LGBT community has reached out to it, especially with the Ally project,” Allen said. “So we just hope that more communities at USC that want to get involved will speak up and we can collaborate with them in the future. Collaboration is what it’s all about.”
Joshua Morris, a senior majoring in  psychology, said he has been a member of QuASA since freshman year.
“What happens in the LGBT community affects everyone,” Morris said. “Knowing that we’re all Trojans, I feel it is very important that we all support each other.”

After starting the season 12-0, the USC women’s volleyball team must now add a tally to its loss column.
The Women of Troy saw their undefeated season come to an end Friday night after losing to No. 10 Washington in five sets, 25-22, 25-22, 15-25, 18-25, 15-5. It was USC’s sixth straight loss in Seattle.
Air it out · Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led USC with 23 kills in the loss to Washington and 19 kills in a win against Washington State. The loss to the Huskies was USC’s first this season after 12 straight wins. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
USC went down two sets early but quickly fought back. It convincingly won game three and broke a 10-10 tie in game four after five straight points behind senior outside hitter Geena Urango’s serve, eventually tying the match at 2-2.
However, the Women of Troy were not able to keep that momentum upon entering the fifth and final set. They lost the clinching game and subsequently the match.
“We won games three and four pretty easily and then never got started in five,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It was really disappointing because I felt we were the better team. Statistics showed we were the better team and we really let Washington steal one.”
Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led USC with 23 kills. Freshman outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana added 16 kills.
“I really wanted to practice being able to handle [Washington’s] intensity, and I didn’t think we did that very well,” Haley said. “Then when we relaxed, I think we just roared through them, kind of took them out of their own game and their own gym, only to come back in the short game, game five, and just not be able to function.”
When the Women of Troy won the third and fourth games, Haley said he was confident about his team’s chances of coming away with the conference victory.
“I thought we were in total control of the match,” Haley said.  “Then we tried too hard in game five again, and it was just a shame.”
After Friday’s defeat, the Women of Troy did not have much time to reflect. They travelled to Pullman to face the Washington State Cougars just a day after the loss.
After being down 8-7 early in the first set, USC won eight straight points behind junior setter Kendall Bateman’s serve, pushing the score to 15-8. After that, USC never faltered, sweeping the Cougars 25-15, 25-17, 25-19.
Jupiter led the team with 19 kills, along with three aces, six blocks and only three unforced errors, hitting .516 in the match. After the game, Haley could do nothing but praise his All-American outside hitter.
“Jupiter came on big time. [Friday] night, she had a lot of kills, but she had 10 unforced errors. [On Saturday], she did a much much better in that regard,” Haley said. “All in all, she just dominated the opposition.”
It was not just Jupiter who committed too many unforced errors this weekend. Haley identified that as one of the biggest problems his team faced.
“It’s just the unforced hitting errors that I think [we need to] work on being a little bit smarter, a little more in control,” Haley said.  “I think as we talk about that in practice and design drills to work on that. I think we’ll get a lot better there.”
Although unforced errors proved to be the team’s Achilles’ heel this weekend, there was one very positive aspect of USC’s play — serving.
“We had 19 aces in two days in Pac-10 competition,” Haley said. “That’s tremendous serving on our part. We served at the highest level we’ve ever served at since I’ve been here at USC.”
The Women of Troy will look to get back on track for next weekend, as they host No. 1 Stanford and No. 8 California at the Galen Center.

A trip to San Diego for a rematch with the University of San Diego finally cooled off the No. 16 USC women’s soccer team, ending its six-game winning streak and handing the Women of Troy only their second loss of the season.
On target · Junior defender Ashley Freyer and the Women of Troy outshot the Toreros on Friday but could not find the back of the net. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
For the second time this year, the University of San Diego Toreros (6-4-2) defeated the Women of Troy (7-2-2) 1-0, to sweep the season series between the two teams.
Like its previous two games against Gonzaga and Eastern Washington, USC was yet again plagued by a slow start, which allowed the Toreros the opportunity to take advantage of play and control the tempo of the game.
Torero midfielder Taylor Housley found the back of the net in the 33rd minute of the first half, but not before the ball bounced off the post and deflected off freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church.
“I thought we played well in the second half, but we came out a little flat in the first half,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We dug ourselves a hole and we couldn’t climb out of it.”
In the second half, the Women of Troy noticeably picked up their play and had plenty of opportunities to tie the game and even seize the lead.
They outshot the Toreros 10-8 throughout the course of the game, but San Diego goalkeeper Courtney Parsons denied the Women of Troy any chance of a comeback, posting her fifth shutout of the season and ensuring the lone goal in the first half was all the Toreros would need to come away with the victory.
“We were clearly the better team today, but we just couldn’t find the back of the net,” junior midfielder Brittany Kerridge said.
The Toreros are the only team to defeat USC this season, and it was the first loss for the team in its last 10 games.
According to junior defender Karter Haug, the Women of Troy can look at this loss as a learning experience that will only help them later on down the road, especially in conference play.
“I think it’s a wake-up call and it’s going to help us grow,” Haug said. “It’s good as we head into Pac-10 play because those teams will be tougher.”
Moving into conference play next weekend against the Stanford Cardinal, Khosroshahin said the team will need to put forth a strong effort for the entire game, rather than just play in spurts. 
“Hopefully the team realizes that every team we play is going to play out of their minds against us and we can’t be off at all,” Khosroshahin said. “We have to start the game the way we’re capable of and finish the game the same way.”

The set-up: After losing to Washington on a field goal with three seconds left last year, USC was out for revenge in its home stadium.
Baffled · USC coach Lane Kiffin experienced his first loss at the helm of the Trojans Saturday, as they were upset 32-31 by Washington. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan 
The story: Washington kicker Eric Folk finished the Trojans with a 32-yard field goal as time expired, sending the Huskies into a dance party on the Coliseum floor.
“It’s a terrible, sick feeling in our stomach,” USC senior fullback Stanley Havili said.
Folk got that opportunity because the Trojans didn’t capitalize on their own, failing to put the Huskies away even though they had multiple chances.
Down 29-28 early in the fourth quarter, USC had two drives deep into Washington territory only to see sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley miss two passes — one that went off the hands of senior receiver David Ausberry in the end zone and one that was too high to senior tight end Jordan Cameron. The Trojans only got three points out of those two drives.
“Unfortunately for us, we had so many opportunities to finish the game out,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “If you’re going be a championship team, you have to finish people off when you have the ball. You can’t go and kick field goals. Two times in a row we go down and [attempt] field goals instead of getting 14 points. We get three points out of two possessions combined.”
The Trojans had a chance to get six points, but senior kicker Joe Houston’s 40-yard field goal attempt hit the right upright and gave Washington the ball with 2:34 left. Houston is now two for six on field goals this year.
“I fully accept responsibility and I feel terrible,” Houston said. “It’s times like this that will check your character. I never thought this day would happen but it did.”
Barkley backed up his kicker.
“Don’t bug Joe because, when it comes down to it, it’s offense that’s supposed to put points on the board,” Barkley said.
Even with the miss, USC had the lead and two chances to stop Washington on its final drive. First, sophomore defensive end Nick Perry forced a fumble on a sack that Washington recovered. Then on fourth-and-11 on the Huskies own 23-yard line, Washington quarterback Jake Locker completed an 18-yard pass for a clutch first down, setting up the game-winning field goal.
“On that fourth down, you make the play and it’s all over and you have a different feeling,” Kiffin said.
Bradford’s big day: If USC had won the game, the story would’ve been the play of senior running back Allen Bradford.
Despite not getting the start, or any of the carries on USC’s Wildcat plays, Bradford rushed for a career-high 223 yards on 21 carries for two touchdowns.
Bradford made his presence felt on his first carry, when he burst through a hole up the middle for a 37-yard touchdown in the first quarter that put USC up 7-0.
“It’s mostly because of the offensive line and Stanley [Havili] who created some huge holes,” Bradford said. “I knew where the open spots in their defense was, and I was hitting them full speed.”
The Trojans were almost able to run at will, totaling 298 rushing yards to just 186 passing yards.
“Our running game was on fire,” Barkley said. “We were running wherever we wanted to.”
Wildcat: For the first time this season, USC broke out the Wildcat formation, but it wasn’t with the person many people expected to be running it.
Freshman phenom running back Dillon Baxter, who played  quarterback in high school, was expected to get most of the reps, but those went to junior running back Marc Tyler.
The Trojans ran the Wildcat close to a dozen times in the first half but only once in the second half. Tyler scored one touchdown out of the formation.
“It seemed to be working,” Barkley said. “If it’s working, I’m all for it.”
Baxter said that nothing was planned in terms of who was going to be running the Wildcat and how many times it was going to be run. Baxter didn’t ask the coaches why he wasn’t running it, he said.
Safety troubles: Locker gave USC’s secondary trouble all night with his dual-threat abilities. The safeties and cornerbacks couldn’t get comfortable because no matter what they did, it seemed like Locker would beat them.
“It’s tough because if we come up he throws it, and if we stay back he’s going to run it,” freshman cornerback Nickell Robey said.
However Washington got its yards, the USC defense seemed like it was back in Hawaii, as it missed tackles and poor coverage all over the field.
But senior cornerback Shareece Wright, who caused a key fumble in the second quarter when he chased down Locker and punched the ball out for a fumble through the end zone, said the Trojans can’t tackle in practice.
“We can’t. We’ll be too banged up,” Wright said.
Horton still hurt: Redshirt sophomore defensive end Wes Horton sat out this game with a back injury.
Horton, who didn’t practice all week, hurt his back when Perry accidentally kicked him last week during the Washington State game. Horton said he learned he wouldn’t play Thursday afternoon and said he’s still in some pain but his range of motion is good.

The goal for the USC women’s swimming team is simple.
“We want to win every dual meet,” senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul said.
Big push · Senior captain Lyndsay DePaul was part of a USC relay team that finished with the lowest time in the 200-yard medley. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy took the first step to accomplishing that goal Friday, defeating Oregon State 141-112 at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
A USC swimmer or team relay posted the lowest time in every event of the afternoon.
“The competition today really came more from ourselves than it did from Oregon State,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
The Women of Troy got off to a fast start in the day’s first event, the 200-yard medley relay. USC’s top team featured three returning All-Americans — DePaul, senior Presley Bard and junior Katinka Hosszu — and freshman Kasey Carlson. They finished in 1:40.68, nearly five seconds faster than the runners up.
The same team ended the meet with the lowest time in the 400-yard freestyle relay, finishing in 3:22.63.
“Our relays did great,” DePaul said.
Hosszu went on to win the 200-yard butterfly in 1:56.78 and the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:14.85, while Bard finished first in the 100-yard backstroke in 54.32.
DePaul posted the fastest time in the 100-yard butterfly at 53.22.
The day’s biggest star, however, was sophomore Haley Anderson, who won the 200-yard (1:49.54) and 500-yard (4:48.79) freestyle events in convincing fashion.
“Haley Anderson did an outstanding job,” Salo said. “She showed some real sprint speed that we didn’t think we had out of her, so she’s going to be a player.”
Salo also left the meet impressed with the performances of some of his top freshmen.
Freshman Meghan Hawthorne captured victories in the 200-yard individual medley (2:03.45) and the 200-yard backstroke (2:01.88), and Carlson won the 50-yard freestyle in 23.21.
“It’s tough for freshmen to understand what the whole dual meet environment is like because it’s very, very quick and they’re not used to that,” Salo said. “So for freshmen to come in and win events, I think is pretty good. So we’re real happy with it.”
Senior Ellie Doran won the 1,000-yard freestyle in 10:07.85, sophomore Jessica Schmitt placed first in the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:03.63, and sophomore Christel Simms won the 100-yard freestyle in 51.49.
“We wanted to put up some times that anyone across the nation would look at this early in the season and know that our program is serious and is focused on being a top-five program at NCAAs this year,” Salo said. “I think we did that.”
The Women of Troy will next compete at their own USC Invitational on Friday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. Salo, however, is already looking forward to the team’s first big challenge.
“Our next big push is toward Arizona, and they’ve always been one of the top three or four teams in the country the last few years,” Salo said about the Nov. 12 meet. “We want to see if we can’t mix it up with them come the beginning of November.”

Defense wins games.
So is it any surprise that USC lost 32-31 Saturday against the pesky Huskies?
The Trojan defense looked utterly anemic this weekend, as Washington quarterback Jake Locker led an offensive charge that picked apart and read USC like a science class dissection lab. Locker threw for 310 yards and a touchdown on 24 for 40 passing and, as if that wasn’t enough, figured he’d run for another 110 and lead the Huskies in rushing as well.
I know what people are saying: “We should have made that field goal!” “Lane Kiffin should have called a timeout toward the end of the game!” “Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley should have converted those red zone passes to senior wide receiver David Ausberry and senior tight end Jordan Cameron!”
All of those missed opportunities would have helped the Trojans’, but none of them should have been necessary in the first place.
Led by defensive greats Monte Kiffin and Ed Orgeron, the Trojan defense coming into 2010 was supposed to be staunch, fortified and revitalized.
It certainly wasn’t any of those things Saturday, something all-too evident on the Huskies’ game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter.
After three uncharacteristic stops by USC to force a fourth-and-11 situation for Washington from its own 23-yard line, the Trojans needed just one more shutdown to walk away from the match unscathed and undefeated.
Instead, the Trojans allowed Locker to scramble around in the backfield and somehow find an open wide receiver in D’Andre Goodwin for 18 yards and a first down.
Things only got worse from there; as the Huskies ran the ball down USC’s throat, making it embarrassingly apparent (as if it weren’t already) that the Trojans have still not figured out how to properly wrap up their opponent and make a tackle.
All that was left to do for Washington was convert an un-iceable 32-yard Erik Folk field goal to all but pull the trigger in an effective execution of a defense that once stood as the epitome of stifling and relentless.
The Trojans surrendered 536 yards, and at times it seemed like it should have been more. Several miscues by the Huskies — a Locker fumble out of the end zone and multiple drops by Washington receivers, for starters — prevented them from taking a firm lead in the game, but the USC defense continued to let the Huskies hang around with consistent breakdowns in coverage and poor tackling.
What exactly does the problem boil down to?
As maddening as it is for Trojan fans to hear, there is nothing to blame other than poor coaching.
USC has the talent. But that talent doesn’t always translate into a successful defense when it is stuck running the wrong defensive schemes. The Trojans’ variation of the Tampa-2 defense is a bad fit for the style of players on USC’s roster, and it has left the team playing catch-up in the first half of each game so far this season.
The lacking secondary play was, for the most part, masked in the first four games this season because of errors and inability by USC’s weaker opponents. All it took to pull the veil off of the Trojans’ gaping problem was a quarterback who knew how to do so.
Enter Locker.
Maybe the defense is a ticking time bomb that happened to go off during Saturday’s loss. USC couldn’t get much pressure on the opposing quarterback from its injury-ravaged defensive line either — inexcusably allowing a quarterback to lead his team in rushing with triple-digit numbers.
But I’d like to think that it isn’t a personnel problem, so much as it is a gross misunderstanding of the type of players USC has — a problem that, unfortunately, comes with a learn-from-experience type of solution.
The Trojans have had as difficult an offseason as they come, but that is only extra incentive to get it done on the field. The tools are there but aren’t being wielded properly.
Maybe the Trojans can learn from this loss and use the lessons to its advantage in the weeks to come. Considering it is already five weeks into the season with the thick of the Trojans’ schedule fast approaching, that notion seems less and less likely with each passing day.
Here’s to wishful thinking.

I agree… Very SAD performance by the defense…….
fight on,

Different stadium, different season.
Same kicker, same story.
Erik Folk hit a 32-yard field goal as time expired to lift Washington to a 32-31 victory over No. 18 USC on Saturday at the Coliseum.
Second coming - Washington junior wide receiver Jermaine Kearse side steps redshirt sophomore cornerback Brian Baucham after making a catch. The Trojans allowed 536 yards to the Huskies, who converted a late field goal to win the game. - Jesse Bowman | Daily Trojan
The outcome was almost identical to a season ago when Folk hit a 22-yard field goal with three seconds left to give the Huskies the upset over then-No. 3 USC. The Washington win might not have been as shocking as it was a year ago, but it was just as debilitating for the Trojans (4-1).
“It’s very painful,” junior defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. “It’s hard to explain how painful it is right now.”
USC had two opportunities to score fourth-quarter touchdowns but came up short both times.
“When you have the ball and you have a chance to finish, you can’t go and kick field goals,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Down 29-28, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley missed wide-open senior wide receiver David Ausberry in the endzone, the ball barely touching Ausberry’s outstretched fingertips. The Trojans settled for a 27-yard field goal by senior kicker Joe Houston and took the lead.
After stopping the Huskies on their next drive, the Trojans moved the ball inside the Washington 25-yard line. Barkley again missed an open receiver, this time senior tight end Jordan Cameron on a third down, so USC had to settle for another field goal attempt.
Only this time, Houston’s 40-yard attempt hit the right field goal post. Houston is two-of-six on field goal tries this year and has not made a kick longer than 34 yards.
“It felt good, that’s for sure. The second you look up it started tailing a little bit. Next thing you know it hits the upright,” Houston said.
When asked if the kicker position would be reopened for competition, Kiffin said, “Definitely.”
After Houston’s miss, Washington took over with 2:34 left on the clock and quarterback Jake Locker marched the Huskies down the field to set up Folk’s winning kick. Locker connected on fourth-and-11 to D’Andre Goodwin to keep the Huskies alive. A few rushes by running back Chris Polk and Washington was in position to make the game-winning kick — and Folk converted.
Locker was again the driving force behind the Huskies’ upset. He amassed 426 total yards — 310 passing and 110 rushing — which accounted for nearly 80 percent of his team’s offense.  
“I have 10 other guys around me that makes it a lot easier,” Locker said. “I’m proud of how we played.”
With Washington in range, Kiffin chose not to use any of his three timeouts to try to preserve time for a potential USC response. Kiffin said he was getting ready to use the timeouts but Washington was moving the ball too easily.
“We weren’t gonna stop them,” Kiffin said. “We were dead.”
Instead, Kiffin used two timeouts to try to ice Folk, but to no avail.
“I was just thinking about making it — I wasn’t thinking about the situation at all or what happened last year,” Folk said.
The game was a back-and-forth offensive affair with eight lead changes. Washington gained 536 total yards and USC was not far behind with 484.
Barkley said he was too worried about not throwing interceptions on those key third-down plays.
“I should have made those passes,” he said. “I was more focused on not turning the ball over.”
Barkley finished 14 for 20 for 186 yards without a touchdown or an interception.
USC got on the board first when senior tailback Allen Bradford took a handoff and ran 37 yards untouched for a score. Washington responded with 17 unanswered points.
The Huskies came a yard away from scoring another first half touchdown, but senior cornerback Shareece Wright knocked the ball out of Locker’s arm before he crossed the goal line. The ball went out of bounds and into the end zone for a touchback.
Overshadowed in the disappointment over the loss was the performance by Bradford, who rushed for a career high 223 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries. After a third-quarter fumble by starting redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler, Bradford got the bulk of the carries and made the most of it.
But Washington slowed Bradford down, making the Trojans throw on two important third downs. The Trojans will now try to shift focus to their big game next week at Stanford, but Kiffin hopes they will take a lesson from this game.
“The hope is that our players learn from this,” Kiffin said. “That we have to finish people off.”
With all due respect to Matt Barkley’ s comments after the game, 31 points was enough for 16 of the 20 Top 25 teams that played on Saturday to win their contests.  Nor can anyone legitimately blame USC’s loss on Joe Houston, who was on the field less than 60 seconds during the entire contest.  No, the way I see it, we lost to a towering foe that brings its own referees to the field of play – the NCAA.  For it was the NCAA that shrewdly added an unannounced fourth year to USC’s scholarship penalty by timing last spring’s announcement with the close of the recruiting season and then handing Cardinal and Gold players a Get Out of Jail Free card.  And it was the NCAA that forced Coach Kiffen to suspend tackling in practice to protect a depth chart that Weight Watchers would be proud of.  Now, with every manager even remotely associated with past problems gone and no one left to legitimately punish, we’ll have to wait to see how much it means when the NCAA’s member schools enthusiastically embrace its ideals.

Going into Thursday night’s installment of Ooh La L.A! festival at the El Rey Theatre, I had one urgent question: Why?
Not only would the name of the event demand an unrepentant slap in the face if uttered in Paris, but the presence of The Little Frenchie food truck by the venue doors furthered the likelihood that the event would be little more than a haven for Americans whose sole regret was not having been conceived to Julien Clerc’s “Quand Je Joue.”
Instead, beyond the venue doors, hundreds of French expatriates and tourists alike flirted and laughed with each other, looking gorgeous in minimalist designer apparel and making this writer regret his own choice of shorts and a knit top.
The crowd ranged from wobbly teens to entire families, most of whom appeared to be reasonably drunk, happy and without any knowledge of the night’s quadruple bill, save for the fact that every musical act hailed from their homeland.
The up-and-coming Turzi kicked off the bill, beginning a night that could have easily doubled as a synthesizer expo. Flanked by towers of machinery, a la Moog and Korg, Turzi played to a slightly interested crowd. Though lacking structure, front man Romain Turzi’s psychedelic sounds evoked both North African Berber medleys and dirty guitars of Krautrock legends Grauzone.
Sadly, the majority of the attendees remained more fixated on their cocktails.
Adding another strange note to the event, the curtains would close between each set and for 40 minutes of veiled preparations for the next act, the El Rey would transform back into a nightclub. The traditional air of excitement at a multi-act concert all but vanished with each drop.
Similarly outfitted with vintage keyboards and accompanied by loops of hallucinogenic cartoons, duo Acid Washed managed to draw more people to the floor. Though the band did its noblest in echoing Cut Copy, both in its cool dress and grooves, Acid Washed suffered from badly timed synths and the same lack of pop sensibility that rendered Turzi’s set monotonous at times. If a mediocre night of club music in the United States consists of indiscernible G-Unit imitators, this is what it must be like in Paris.
Thankfully, it seemed a tangible portion of the crowd had come solely for the night’s headlining act: electro-lounge enfant terrible Sébastien Tellier.
Though his set was billed as acoustic, the hulking Roland synths and electric piano that lurked behind the other acts quashed any fears that the plastic soundscapes of his 2008 LP, Sexuality, would cascade through each song.
The curtains opened without warning just past 10 p.m., and Tellier, who wore a loose-fitting shirt and sparkling silver tights, launched into a glorious 45 minutes of sleazy bliss, accompanied by arrangements more beautiful and heartfelt than one would expect with such an act.
Though Tellier sported his trademark beard, sunglasses and unkempt hair that brings to mind Joaquin Phoenix’s current appearance, he more closely resembled the late Serge Gainsbourg or at least a sketch of the legend. His love of mischievous wordplay and intimate audience interaction injected the night with a much-needed dose of power and eroticism.
While swaying his way through hits such as “Divine” and the darker “L’Amour et La Violence,” Tellier seemed uncontrolled by anything but his most primitive urges. At one point during an abbreviated version of the lovely “La Ritournelle,” Tellier grabbed two water bottles from the stage floor and for a moment attempted to juggle them. Perhaps sensing the disaster that would ensue, he instead decided to bang them against his thighs for percussion.
The crowd ate it up, going wild when Tellier would sit on the edge of the stage and sing to a lucky few. When he finally left the stage, an air of disappointment wafted from the crowd, no doubt aware that his set could have easily packed in a few more generous numbers.
Thankfully, Tellier returned — an enormous, hand-rolled cigarette smoldering away between two fingers — and struck a brief but uproarious disco pose before serenading the audience with the proper, prolonged version of “La Ritournelle,” savoring the simple yet beautiful piano medley that built until Tellier’s amorous vocals drove the epic number home.
DJ Kavinsky closed the night with an occasionally blistering set of tracks, including his signature “Testarossa Autodrive.” As the decks blinked away, the crowd slowly funneled out into the stagnant L.A. night, some unsure of what they had witnessed but weirdly enthralled nonetheless.

In the heart of Hollywood, steps away from the Walk of Fame, lies the historic Music Box. On Friday night, a crowd of diverse and eager listeners lined the Walk of Fame for a chance to hear the mind-bending sounds of Miniature Tigers, Prefuse 73 and Neon Indian, who performed at the venue.
The Music Box, constructed in the ’20s, is a paradoxically vast but intimate building containing an opulent ballroom with a broad dance floor flanked on both sides by colonnades of booths.  In front of the dance floor stands the stage, masked by archaic curtains and contained within a garishly gold frame. At 9 p.m., the heavy drapes rose to reveal the first band, Miniature Tigers.
Miniature Tigers had an interesting group dynamic: The lead singer flowed with energy, the bassist gently rocked from side to side with his eyes closed, the drummer — wearing a peculiar Christmas sweater — was frenetic, and the keyboardist seemed lost in the background.
At first, it seemed like there was no uniformity within the group, but as the set got rolling, the band started to flow like a more cohesive unit. The band exhibited true musicianship when the drummer, bassist and keyboardist successfully swapped instruments with each other — multiple times.
Miniature Tigers kept the set exciting as members utilized sporadic tempo and dynamic shifts. The lead singer and drummer furiously thrashed their instruments, while the bassist plucked his strings in a mellow fashion. From the keyboard and soundboard emanated a mesh of pulverizing bass and Polynesian-like chords that the crowd seemed to enjoy as the set came to a close.
Next up was the musician/producer Prefuse 73, who surprised the audience with two DJs and dual drummers. Prefuse 73 stood center stage amid his equipment and commenced his set with an extraterrestrial prelude that would foreshadow the strangeness of his performance.
As Prefuse 73 got going, a juxtaposition of vocal and 808 drum screams resonated throughout the ballroom. At first the dual drummers were an innovative concept, but the repetitive and rudimentary drumbeats soon became monotonous. Between electronic jam sessions, Prefuse 73 put on galactic interludes that left the audience dazed and confused rather than interested.
The highlight of Prefuse 73’s set was a concoction of what an alien harmonica or accordion might sound like. The grimy, bass thumping coaxed the crowd to move and swing to the beat.
Eventually, the headliner, Neon Indian, took the stage. As the curtains were drawn back one final time, the four musicians greeted the fans with humble appreciation.
Behind the band, on the back wall of the stage were projections of trippy, psychedelic images. The pictures, in conjunction with a strobe and a rainbow-colored light show, mimicked what an acid trip might be like — and appropriately so, Neon Indian’s set included one of its most popular hits, “Should Have Taken Acid With You.”
While the screen propelled vibrant images, Neon Indian was just beginning its string of surprises. Front man Alan Palomo, showed off his theremin, an electronic instrument that oscillates frequency and volume. Although most theremins are commonly associated with eerie metallic sounds, Palomo was able to morph a cosmic stream of melody from the strange instrument.
The lights went off, and — amid gasps from the audience — guitarist Ronald Gierhart’s pick guard served as the sole source of illumination. The pick guard projected a collage of psychedelic colors that hypnotized the audience. Almost immediately, a fan from the back of the ballroom yelled, “Dude, I love your guitar!”
The dance floor truly erupted when Palomo started the band’s hit “Deadbeat Summer” with a unique fade-in. Shouts of “Yeahs!” and an overpowering surge of applause almost drowned out the introduction. The entire audience became frantic as the crowd was asked to help the band sing the song, and everybody enthusiastically obliged.
Waves of bass ravenously consumed the ballroom as Neon Indian’s set concluded. The audience’s incessant applause beckoned Neon Indian back to the stage for an obligatory encore, which let Gierhart’s true psychedelic colors shine as he shredded through a virtuosic solo that mesmerized the ears — and the eyes — thanks again to the light-up pick guard.
If the concert was supposed to mimic an acid trip, the end of the concert was an unfortunate snap back to reality. The psychic sounds of Neon Indian haunted The Music Box as the crowd was exiled back to the Walk of Fame.
Great article Sean.  I really felt as though I was there.  Can’t wait for your next one.

If you think sandwiches are boring, you’ve probably had one too many ham and cheese sandwiches on Wonder Bread because there is nothing as wonderfully open-ended and variable as the glorious sandwich.
Piled high · The Highway 128 from Mendocino Farms is a rich, gourmet sandwich filled with large amounts of chicken, goat cheese, field greens and various fruit chutneys, making it a healthy, filling meal. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
A sandwich is art. An incomprehensible scribble to one is displayed proudly as art by another.
Likewise, a sandwich is subjective and open to all ranges of tastes, which is why it is hard to find someone who absolutely dislikes a sandwich. There are just simply too many sandwiches in the world.
Which is why, like art, to find the perfect fit, you need to first observe the fine galleries of sandwiches. Thankfully, Los Angeles has plenty, falling under all kinds of categories, depending on what mood you’re in.
The Virtuous and Healthful
For those seeking creative, aesthetically pleasing and good quality food but reluctant to negate the hours of sweating spent on the elliptical machine, head Downtown to Mendocino Farms.
Mendocino Farms is a fine dining bistro disguised as a casual cafeteria that serves creative sandwiches inspired from classic favorites. The ingredients used are fresh and seasonal, plucked right off the local farmers market.
Perhaps you relish the nostalgic grilled cheese you once had with Campbell’s tomato soup when your babysitter came over, but not the additives in bright orange American cheese. Try the vegetarian Drunk’n Goat in Paris — a thick slab of herby goat cheese, cranberry chutney, French brie, caramelized onions, green apple and organic greens sandwiched between sweet, nutty slices of cranberry walnut bread.
Or if you’re craving an Asian kick, go for the popular Kurobuta Pork Belly Banh Mi, which is a full entrée by itself with caramelized kurobuta pork heaped on ciabatta bread with refreshingly crunchy pickled Vietnamese slaw, jalapeños and chili aioli.
The Naughty and Lustful
If calories are no deterrent to your carnivorous ways, take a 20-minute drive out to Cemitas & Clayudas Pal Cabron at Huntington Park, home of Los Angeles’ best cemitas, the beloved street staple of Puebla.
The best way to describe a cemita is in battle terms. A true cemita is a tasty explosion of flavors and textures trapped in a mine of lard-infused roll, guaranteed to make a masochist out of even the most well-behaved health nut.
Indeed, you’ll see this theme of maximalist indulgence all around this Pueblan restaurant — the first thing you notice when you walk in are the lascivious paintings on the bright yellow walls.
As you take a seat, you’ll be winked at by drawings of many more of these melon-breasted women with come-hither smirks, each one representing a cemita on the menu.
The cemita is devoid of traditional sandwich fixings. You will find no mayonnaise, mustard, lettuce or tomatoes. Stuffed full of meat and cheese, this sinful monster still manages to be fatter and fuller than the bosom of the seductive murals.
Try the popular La Bronca — slopping hunks of slow-cooked and pulled lamb, creamy string cheese, chipotle and bitter papalo leaves swelling out of a crusty, slightly sweet, sesame-seed studded cemita bun — all for less than $6. Gluttony has never tasted so cheap, or so good.
The Proper and Conservative
Do you find modern cuisine with fancy fusion spins annoying and sacrilegious? You better stick with the classics at long-time establishments such as Langers.
Langers is tucked away in a sketchy area across MacArthur Park in the west part of Downtown, but that dingy atmosphere is excusable — even desired — from a diner boasting 64 years of service.
The menu requires half a day just to read through all the items listed, so just skip the dilly-dally and start out with the No. 19 — oodles of hot, fatty pastrami, Swiss cheese, coleslaw and Russian dressing oozing between chewy rye bread.
Classics are classics for a reason. You just can’t go wrong with timeless traditions.
The Sweet and Savvy
Who says sandwiches need only be savory? Log on to Twitter and Facebook and chase down Coolhaus, the coolest sandwich shop on wheels.
Don’t tell your parents, but the Coolhaus truck is the best excuse to have ice cream for dinner. After all, it comes as a sandwich, though you might want to leave out the part that the only greens you’ll find is in the matcha green tea ice cream.
Ordering at Coolhaus works the same way as Subway does. You choose your bread, which in this case would come in various types of cookie such as oatmeal or chocolate chip, and then the ice cream fillings — a plethora of artisanal, all-natural ice cream flavors, including brown butter with candied bacon and balsamic fig and mascarpone.
And vegans, rejoice — you can also get your sugar fix with its dairy-free blood orange sorbet or horchata ice cream.
The Broke and Carless
Aside from stopping by Carl’s Jr. or Subway, pick up some cheap ingredients from the store, and create your own awesome sandwiches.
They need not be fancy. Adding slices of banana and crisp bacon can jazz up even a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As a general rule of thumb, the fewer the ingredients, the higher quality it should be. That means even simple bread and butter can be amazing — but that bread better not be generic white sandwich bread from the Dollar Store.
Think in terms of taste and texture. The best sandwich comes with a bit of crunch, creaminess and chew. This can be easily achieved with some grated carrots and walnuts, whipped cream cheese and cinnamon raisin bread respectively.
Balance out the flavors as well. If you’ve got something bold and salty like smoked ham, add an undertone of sweetness, perhaps with a crisp slice of apple, or a smear of apricot preserves. Or if you’ve got something mild and bland like roasting chicken, adding pungent Gorgonzola cheese or rich caramelized onions will give it the little zing it needs.
A sandwich is really an art craft. It requires a certain base knowledge, a fair amount of thought the appropriate materials to assemble a stellar sandwich that balances the right amount of flavors and textures. But like an open canvas, it also is forgiving to all kinds of experiments and adventures.

Autumn’s arrival has ushered in orange and black decorations at the Disneyland Resort — and it’s one that is well worth the money.
Halloween Time at the theme park began Sept. 17 and will run  until Oct. 31. Aside from its typical array of cartoon-themed decorations, Disneyland now features pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons. As the story goes, the Disney villains have taken over the park.
The spooky atmosphere begins outside the boundaries of the resort, with statues of Disney characters dressed in ghoulish costumes and dancing in an orange plethora of pumpkins dotting the sides of the street. Entrance and exit gates are topped with Mickey and Goofy pumpkins, and on the park’s brochure and map, the old witch from Snow White clutches a pumpkin with Mickey’s likeness.
Each of the attractions has been redesigned to reflect the theme. Main Street, U.S.A., the first Disneyland town, is a magical sight of fall colors: ribbons and signs in orange, yellow and burgundy and scattered about are more than 300 pumpkins marking the Main Street Pumpkin Festival. Perhaps the biggest attraction is the 16-foot-tall Mickey Mouse jack-o’-lantern located in the center of Main Street.
But Disneyland’s Halloween Time is more than just new decorations, it’s also a chance for holiday-themed treats and gifts.
A trip to the Mad Hatter gift shop reveals sections dedicated entirely to Halloween wear: Mickey ears with candy corn, pumpkins and skeletons — even top hats from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Candy stores and bakeries feature Halloween-inspired snacks, such as Mickey-shaped caramel apples, though these treats are deceptively pricey. Several stands around Disneyland also sell similarly spooky souvenirs, such as T-shirts and balloons.
Another enticing element is the Disney characters who roam the streets in full Halloween costume. Classic figures, such as Goofy and Mickey, strut around as skeletons and vampires, adding a Halloween flair to everyday park events.
Aside from the themed hosts, the most impressive changes to the park accompany two major attractions: the Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.
The Haunted Mansion is now a Nightmare Before Christmas-themed extravaganza that allows Jack Skellington and Sally from the film to wander the park. In an impressive effort, nearly every decoration and room has been altered, complete with ghostly holograms of Jack’s pet, Zero, and an enormous Christmas tree.
Psychedelic decorations mimic those seen in rides such as the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and accompany singing pumpkins, creepy ice angels and Santa hat-wearing zombies. Do not expect to miss Jack either; he makes multiple appearances throughout the ride along with other characters from the movie.
Although the Haunted Mansion is more glittery than scary, Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy incorporates some truly frightening effects. There are no familiar characters or storyline — just a journey through space with ghosts and sound effects. The illusions are not 3-D, which lessens the scare-factor throughout the course of the ride, but it is still an overall amusing experience.
Less impressive, but still worth visiting, is a small corner in Frontierland dedicated to Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead. A band of skeletons adorns the area, playing instruments and wearing flashy sombreros. The main attraction here is free face-painting with choices from four different skeleton pictures.
Also in Frontierland is the Big Thunder Ranch, which has various Halloween activities and crafts.
At the end of the day, Disneyland is a beautiful place covered in candles and jack-o’-lanterns. The nighttime fireworks display has been revamped for the Halloween season and is a must-see.
For those willing to spend the extra money, Disneyland also offers limited opportunities to participate in Mickey’s Halloween Party. Visitors can dress up to trick-or-treat, watch a parade and meet costumed characters.
California Adventure has also made small adjustments for Halloween Time as well. The infamous Twilight Zone Tower of Terror now includes confrontations with ghostly patrons. There is also the new World of Color show — an attraction not particularly Halloween-oriented — and a sci-fi party called ElecTRONica at the Hollywood Pictures Backlot beginning Oct. 8.
Halloween Time at Disneyland is a fun and thrilling experience — taking a fun time at the park and adding a holiday twist. It should not be missed.
We took the kids to the haunted house of mouse and love the effort Disney puts into things. The kids were never scared and enjoyed all the Halloween trickery!

After months of speculation on its fate, Comic-Con International is staying in San Diego through 2015.
The deal came after a three-way proposition war between San Diego, Los Angeles and Anaheim over hosting the annual comic book and all-things-geeky convention when the current lease expires in 2012. The issue arose over attendance in recent years, which forced a limit of 125,000 guests at the convention starting in 2007.
Although places like the Los Angeles Convention Center could hold more people — and putting the convention in Los Angeles would certainly be more convenient for the ever-growing Hollywood presence at the convention — San Diego offers more amenities to patrons than Los Angeles could. The San Diego Convention Center, where Comic-Con is held, is located right next to the Gaslamp District, offering attendees plenty in the way of hotels, food and things to do in the evening. Downtown Los Angeles, despite some heavy renovation in the last few years, is not there yet.
“We are grateful for the tireless efforts all three cities put into to their proposals,” said David Glanzer, Comic-Con’s director of marketing and public relations. “In the end, we feel this decision is the best for all those who attend Comic-Con and for the organization itself. We are happy that the community has worked with us to ensure that we remain here.”
By 2016, maybe other cities will be bigger contenders. For now, San Diego is where it’s at.

I used to spend a fair amount of time mapping alternate routes to class to avoid the phalanx of Greenpeace volunteers that descend on campus every year. It wasn’t because my views don’t fall in line with the organization’s, but because ducking through an alley and darting behind a few trash cans is marginally less embarrassing than showing a volunteer my latest bank statement and pointing to the number next to the negative sign.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Every year, however, there is invariably at least one day when I realize there simply aren’t enough alleys. Our campus is often host to a variety of environmentally conscious organizations, and this is appropriate.
We are an environmentally conscious student body — or at least we have the potential to be. Walking to class might feel like navigating the upper levels of PacMan, but ultimately we are lucky to be a student body on the cusp of sustainability and change.
The real question, however, doesn’t involve our ideals as much as our stamina.
Sure, we’re green. But how politically active is our campus going to be in an election that doesn’t determine the president?
With such a flurry of activism on campus, it would seem a no-brainer that students will come out in hordes against Proposition 23, a measure that would freeze AB 32 — the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 — until California’s unemployment rate drops below 5.5 percent for four consecutive quarters.
But this summer’s primaries saw five students vote on campus. The cast of Friends could have shown up and had more of an impact. This number was a vertical dive from the more than 300 who cast their ballots in 2008.
USC boasts a squad of environmental groups: Always Living In View of the Environment, Trojans for Environmental Awareness, Conservation and A Healthy Planet, Environment First — the list goes on. But who’s going to decide the fate of Prop 23?
Proponents of Prop 23 take beef with AB 32, the 2006 ballot measure intended to reduce California emissions levels by 2020 to what they were in 1990. A statewide pledge to put a lid on greenhouse gases with a concrete time frame, however, was a victory for those trumpeting California as the bastion of environmentalism. But it did ruffle some feathers with oil companies — the ones that stood to lose.
These companies — Valero Energy and Tesoro Corp. — have poured a combined $5.6 million into the Yes on Prop 23 campaign.
Both are based out of San Antonio, Texas.
Clearly, out of state interest groups play more than just a fringe role in California politics; you’d have to look back no farther than Prop 8’s 2008 campaign, to which the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints contributed lavishly. Ordinary citizens don’t have the money to back their pet causes — but they can make an effort to turn out to the polls.
Prop 23 plays on a logical fallacy. It aims to put a moratorium on a clean energy bill until California’s unemployment rate drops drastically — an entirely unfeasible goal.
This midterm election is all about jobs; California’s unemployment rate is wavering around 12.4 percent, and both gubernatorial candidates have stressed employment as one of their biggest goals.
The stipulations for reintroducing AB 32 are almost unattainable. California’s employment rate must drop to less than 5.5 percent — something it has done only three times in the last 30 years.
Ultimately, the proposition is a way for oil companies to skirt regulations on the amount of emissions they produce. Jobs are simply the buzz word thrown in to lure voters.
In fact, there’s nothing to prove that AB 32 has a negative impact on the economy — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says that 500,000 green jobs have been created because of its enactment.
Ultimately, passing this proposition could damage California’s place at the helm of environmental reform. The Global Warming Solutions Act doesn’t simply affect our state — reform spurs more reform. As goes California, so goes the nation.
It’s time for California students — who have already proven themselves vested in the interests of a sustainable state — to rally enough support and enthusiasm at the polls this November to overturn this Proposition.
Who’s going to decide the vote — out of state interest groups, or ourselves?

I realize some Trojans fit the stereotype born with a silver spoon in their mouths, but for the rest of you, I presume you want to graduate and actually find gainful employment sometime soon.  The Job market hasn’t been this bad in a generation, and the economic eco-terrorists with their green propaganda only make it worse.  Quite possibly, the group of people the worst off are fresh college grads!  If you don’t care to be able to pay back your student loans, then vote “No” on Prop. 23.  Otherwise, you deserve what you get–which is nowhere.  Remember, you actually have to have been *working* before you can collect an unemployment check.
This Alum, for one, won’t be hiring any more Trojans for some time to come, due to the drop in revenues we’ve experienced.  The leftist Obama voters got the change they deserved–its a shame they had to screw everyone else in the process.
The biggest concern about Prop 23 and oil industry behind it are people in the Renewable Energy industry who stand to lose billions of dollars in future profits if repealed.
Renewable Energy projects produce electricity. Electricity is not produced from foreign oil and does not reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
There isn’t a shortage of electricity. The US Energy Information Agency reports electrical demand declined 3.6% last year. Any PERMANENT (non temp construction) RE jobs will be offset by closure of conventional power plants because we don’t need the electricity.
It is too little and too late to affect Climate change and is a political solution.  The original Kyoto Accords were to reduce Green House Gases 5.2% below 1990 levels as a START when the Chinese rode bicycles and not the present goal of 17% below 2005.  GHG emissions RATES can be reduced but LEVELS will continue to rise.  
OH DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Correction, “Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints contributed lavishly.” The Church did not contribute money to the Proposition. It paid for travel for employees to visit California (and paid a fine based on a court’s ruling). Individual citizens that happen to be members contributed to the campaign, along with millions of other Californians. The lists of contributors are available online. This has been covered in the press. Please do the research and correct your article.
I would hope that engineering and science students would stand up to this commentary and refute the scientific basis of the anthropogenic CO2 theory that it is the cause of global warming.  Climategate has uncovered the myth and many investigations before and since have exonerated CO2 as having any effect on global warming.  This was proven many decades ago by H. Lamb in his History of Climate’s studiy of the Medieval warming, when there were no SUVs or coal-fired power plants to generate anthropogenic CO2.  That warming was due to natural causes, and that goes as well for the cooler warming of the 20th Century.  
Further consult such sites as Watts up with that, JoAnne Nova, and Climate Realists, and the many links availaable at these sites.
Beware of green propaganda.  Mr. Richard”s comment above has been repeated on hundreds of commentary sections like this. And beware of government propaganda, either from Sacramento or Washington.  It is all jive they are propagating to keep their jobs. 
I for one am grateful that the Texas Oil companies are helping Californians fight the criminal AB 32 law which would otherwise destroy not only millions of jobs but put the California economy on the fast train to  serfdom imder the tyrannical rule of an unelected agency (CARB).  Economist Steven F. Hayward has predicted that the “80 by 50” regulation of AB 32 (80% reduction of CO2 by 2050) would put the country in a tailspin to the pre-Edison days of the cotton gin.
Trojans, I urge you to support Prop 23.  AB 32 will make the job market when you graduate far worse than today.See my website for further information on this.
I hope you are right and that CO2 is not actually the cause of global climate change, but I’m just not convinced you are.  “ClimateGate” is a story that is quickly losing its legs–two of the scientists most closely related to that controversy, Phil Jones and Michael Mann, have both been cleared of wrongdoing, and there is more scientific evidence on the side of man-made climate change than refuting it.  You call upon engineering and science students and professors to your side, but the information from which I am basing my claims come from those very people.
Besides your rant against climate change, however, you do nothing to show how AB 32 is harming the market, other than making bombastic claims about pre-Edison days and simply saying that it will harm job growth because it will harm job growth.
When I want to vote for something, I look at where the money is coming from.  Prop 23 is being supported primarily by the oil companies; who do you think this proposition is really crafted to help?  The people of California?  Or some Texas oil companies?  I think the money speaks for itself.  I, for one, am voting NO on Prop 23.
The California Jobs Initiative (CJI) is an oil corporation farce and fraud. There is no connection, whatsoever, between greenhouse gas emission reduction and the loss of jobs. This notion is an insult to the intelligence of the people of California. In fact, there is job growth in the clean, renewable energy industry. Chevron employs 65,000 worldwide and CJI is not going to change this. The only jobs created by the oil industry are clean-up jobs after oil spills and deep water, blow-outs and pump-handler jobs. CJI will make fantastic profits for the oil industry, increase air pollution, especially in communities around their refineries and there will not be lower gas prices. Koch Industries, Valero and Tesoro are super Enrons. Since when did the oil companies start to show any concern for the unemployed and their families and for small businesses?

If a student in a UCLA shirt says that USC is completely, utterly, no-questions-asked superior to UCLA in every way, would you ignore him just because he’s wearing a UCLA shirt?
Probably not, since he’s just stating what’s true.
But on the whole, there’s a rather disturbing public trend: We will voraciously pursue the most immaterial details of a person to try and discredit his argument.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
On Friday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined Space Explorations Technologies (SpaceX), a Hawthorne, Calif.-based company that designs and manufactures space launch vehicles and rockets, $45,600 for violations of the EPA’s hazardous waste requirements. SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk also created the famous green technology car manufacturer, Bay Area-based Tesla Motors, so naturally the pundits sprang to action, howling their accusations of liberal hypocrisy.
A few cleverly placed hints about “hazardous materials,” suggestive images of radioactive waste, a string of snide remarks about holier-than-thou green technology advocates, a little jealousy over Tesla’s success and voilá — a “gotcha” media moment ensued for Musk.
In this case, as with most, the hullabaloo is a little ridiculous. According to the EPA, the main violations were improperly storing or labeling hazardous materials, one of which was isopropyl alcohol, i.e. plain old rubbing alcohol.
But scandal-mongerers will hunt for any excuse at all to discredit a cause  — in this case, green technology.
When “climategate,” a server-hacking incident involving the Climatic Research Unit, occurred, climate change skeptics immediately pounced on the opportunity to denounce the possibility of global warming over a paltry number of e-mail correspondences between a few scientists. The poor choices of the scientists do not serve as legitimate proof against climate change.
In 2006, the public lambasted Al Gore for possessing a less-than-eco-friendly private jet and failing to practice what he preached in his Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Although the criticisms might have been both reasonable and deserved, using them as a reason to ignore his campaign against global warming was unwarranted.
Although proponents of an idea should certainly adhere to it themselves — if only for the sake of credibility —  there is no need for ad hominum attacks on the messenger in order to obscure the message.
Even if the spokesperson for a movement does not always angelically toe the line, the idea behind the movement is still valid.
If an advocate from California’s Public Interest Research Group hasn’t registered to vote, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t vote. If our professors skip steps in solving problems, it doesn’t mean that we should on exams.
Admittedly, with certain issues, if the champion advocate fails to live up to expected standards, his entire message is called into question. Politicians and their campaigns can be broken by a single scandal, not matter how trivial. Americans detest hypocrisy perhaps more than any other character flaw a public figure can possess.
A single individual’s choice, however, should not have the leverage to undermine the entire perspective on an issue.
We might view the primary spokesperson as the face or embodiment of a movement itself, and the way the two are currently synonymous leaves much to be desired. Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin neither represent nor discredit all conservative American ideals; neither do Jon Stewart and Paul Krugman encapsulate all liberal views.
Attacking the messenger only serves as an excuse to deny the message without considering the truths it might contain.
Of course, it might be far simpler to write off the opposing viewpoint by besmirching the personal lives of those involved. Plenty of people on all sides do not strictly follow their own teachings.
If SpaceX, one of Musk’s many start-up babies, has already corrected the violations behind its EPA fine, then this irrational, barely tangential smear on green technology can finally fade away into the insignificance it merits.
Next time the figurehead of a cause is caught doing something unsavory, let’s not forget that his actions don’t tell the whole story.
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health.
“climate change skeptics immediately pounced on the opportunity to denounce the possibility of global warming over a paltry number of e-mail correspondences between a few scientists.”
As the blogger who’s blog received those files, I wonder if you can point to a single instance where the alleged skeptic blogs said the emails were proof that there isn’t global warming?   I’m sure it has to be out there on someone’s blog but I haven’t seen it.  
Also there were over a thousand emails (hardly a small number) with more interesting messages in them. Besides the completely obvious corruption of hide the decline, they contained blocking of peer review of critical  papers, blocking of FOI, deletion of emails related to the IPCC conclusions, trimming of declining temperature endpoints for presentations and plenty more. 
Still, I don’t recall ever reading or writing that global warming was proven wrong. 
The issues reasoned skeptics present are far more nuanced and if you intend to present a reasonable source of information at this site, you may want to be more careful.
If a student in a UCLA shirt says that USC is completely, utterly, no-questions-asked superior to UCLA in every way, would you ignore him just because he’s wearing a UCLA shirt?
I’d say he’s obviously a gifted student with a superior intelligence, worthy of a scholarship to USC!

In June, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that former USC football coach Pete Carroll received $4.1 million in compensation in the 2008-2009 fiscal year — a seemingly staggering figure, but when you consider that Carroll’s $4,415,714 in earnings in 2006-2007 made him the highest-paid college employee in the country, that’s not surprising.
But now, records obtained by The Chronicle show that most recent number to be higher — about $4.6 million total.
Tax records show USC paid $500,000 to a privately owned, Washington-based company, “Compete Inc,” that lists Carroll as its president. The payments were for “services performed” by Carroll, and were not included in the original $4.1 million in base salary and incentives that Carroll received.
In January, Carroll left USC for the head coaching position of the Seattle Seahawks. Months later, a major NCAA investigation of the university’s football and basketball programs returned a bevy of sanctions that included a large cut in scholarships as well as a two-year ban from postseason play.
