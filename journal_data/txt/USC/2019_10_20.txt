I caught some flak for a column I wrote earlier this season after USC lost to BYU 30-27 in which I wrote that Trojan fans need to manage their expectations. A fan or two (who obviously only read the headline and not the column) went after me on Twitter and asked why fans should approach a blue blood like USC with anything other than a championship-or-bust mentality. 
The argument I actually made is that fans have to recognize that this team is not close to a playoff-caliber group and that it would take time to build the discipline and accountability required to become a championship program, which is always the goal.
It’s a small sample size, but I’m starting to see some of that progression from USC — at least, more of it than was apparent during the abomination that was the 2018 season. Even in road losses to ranked teams in Washington and Notre Dame, I saw a strength of will that helped keep the Trojans in the game in situations when last year’s team surely would have crumbled. USC fans don’t care about moral victories — and rightfully so — but they’re better than getting blown out, right?
USC’s 41-14 victory over Arizona at the Coliseum Saturday night was another performance that surprised me, not so much for the result but the manner. With defensive starters sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin, redshirt sophomore nickel back Greg Johnson, sophomore linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV and redshirt senior defensive lineman Christian Rector all out, I figured USC would win in a shootout with a Wildcats offense that entered the game ranked ninth in the nation in yards per game.
USC ultimately put up a lot of points, but the defense was the dominant group, keeping Arizona from scoring until a few minutes into the fourth quarter. By then, USC already had the game well in hand up 34-0.
Perhaps the best player on the field was sophomore inside linebacker Kana’i Mauga, who only started because of Gaoteote’s absence. Mauga dominated, posting 13 tackles, a sack and two takeaways (an interception and a forced fumble) that directly led to 6 USC points. 
“It was like unleashing somebody that was just waiting for his chance, and I can’t tell you how happy I am for him and our team that we have a guy like this,” head coach Clay Helton said of Mauga’s performance.
Fifth-string freshman running back Kenan Christon used the speed that made him a high school track star to dash for touchdowns of 55 and 30 yards in the second half. After sophomore Stephen Carr and redshirt freshman Markese Stepp left the game with injuries, Christon’s speed made an immediate impression on his coaches.
“It was fun tonight because when he hit the first one, [running backs coach] Mike Jinks as soon as he hit the line of scrimmage said ‘touchdown,’” Helton said.
Along with Mauga and Christon, backup freshmen Dorian Hewett and Max Williams held their own at cornerback and nickel back, respectively. That type of production from young backups is what you see from the best teams, who have not only the recruiting ability but the coaching acumen to get star-level play from bench players.
The best programs also play with toughness and aggression, and USC had both in spades. Sophomore cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart played despite an ankle injury and made a few key plays through the pain. As for aggression, the defensive front racked up seven sacks, making life miserable for whoever was in at quarterback for Arizona.
“We call it like you gotta bring the juice to the game,” Hewett said of the defensive performance. “When we brought the juice, there wasn’t nothing the offense could really do to stop us.”
Elite teams also have a knack for finding ways to win when things go wrong. The Trojan offense failed to pick up a first down on its first four possessions but paired a dynamic rushing attack with a complementary passing game to score 31 points over the final 31 minutes of the game. Helton said he’s been happy with how Graham Harrell’s offense has adjusted to early difficulties in recent games.
“There’s just a little bit of time that takes place to go ‘OK, this is what we’re getting, and this is our adjustments,’ and I credit Coach [Harrell] and the offensive staff,” he said. “They’ve done a great job of being able to say ‘OK, this is what it’s going to be today, let’s get to the place we need to get to,’ and then you look up in the end with 450 yards and 41 points.”
USC got some help from Arizona, to be sure. The Wildcats turned the ball over three times, all in their own territory, and fell apart in virtually every aspect by the middle of the game. But on this night, USC actually took advantage of its opponents’ missteps, a crucial quality of a team that has reached its full potential.
I’m not saying USC is back, I promise. In fact, I would expect plenty of regression on the road, where the Trojans always struggle, against Colorado later this week. But you have to keep an eye out for these types of developments. 
Mental strength is absolutely the top factor in a football team playing above its talent, and this program already has plenty of talent. I doubt it will happen this season, but USC will be scary if it can make Saturday’s mentality the new normal.

This season of USC football has seen many backups step up due to injuries, and Saturday’s 41-14 win over Arizona was no different.
Sophomore linebacker Kana’i Mauga — who started in place of injured sophomore Palaie Gaoteote IV — posted 13 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and an interception off Arizona freshman backup quarterback Grant Gunnell deep in Arizona territory.
“He [was] just being so special on our special teams, and that’s what Kana’i is, just a true teammate doing whatever is called upon to help the team win,” head coach Clay Helton said. “And then he’s called upon to be the starter tonight. And lo and behold, an interception and tackles everywhere. It was like unleashing somebody that was just waiting for his chance.”
Perhaps just as surprising was the effort of freshman running back Kenan Christon, who entered the game after injuries to junior Stephen Carr and redshirt freshman Markese Stepp. The former California high school sprinting champion broke free for two long touchdowns — a 55-yarder and a 30-yarder — which added to Arizona’s demoralizing deficit.
Carr and Stepp were just two of six Trojans to leave the game due to injury. Most notably, sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga went to the locker room after sustaining a shoulder injury at the end of the first quarter, while freshman defensive end Drake Jackson was spotted wearing a boot on the sidelines after injuring his ankle in the third.
“It does hurt us a lot … We’ve fought and we’ve gave it everything we have every gameday out, and personally I pray for them to get better,” redshirt freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart said. “Stuff happens like that, that’s the game of football. It did hurt the soul, but we’ve gotta keep on, move on to the next one.”
The Trojan defense was already short four starters — redshirt senior defensive end Christian Rector, redshirt sophomore nickel back Greg Johnson, Gaoteote and sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin. Freshmen Max Williams and Dorian Hewett filled in at nickel back and cornerback, respectively, assisting the defensive effort with solid coverage.
Helton said he will have updates about the status of the Trojans’ injured players Monday.
Despite the defensive injuries, the team was able to contain dual-threat senior quarterback Khalil Tate. Tate was sacked six times and threw for just 47 yards before he was benched early in the third quarter.
Helton said Clancy Pendergast’s defense studied how NFL teams defend athletic quarterbacks to prepare to face Tate.
“We wanted to keep him bottled up,” Pendergast said. “We’ve seen a lot of him over the years. We know what kind of player he is, and the guys really just zeroed in and focused on what we needed to do.”
The Trojan offense also minimized errors, allowing the team to win the turnover battle for the first time since last season’s opener against UNLV. USC’s only turnover came when redshirt junior running back Quincy Jountti, who came in after Stepp’s departure, fumbled the ball away. After Jountti lost the ball, Mauga promptly intercepted Gunnell to give possession back to the Trojans. Arizona also muffed a punt and fumbled, resulting in two early USC scores.
Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis took a while to get going but ended the game with 232 yards and two touchdowns. Despite his solid numbers, Slovis admitted he could have played better, especially in the first quarter.
“A lot of that’s on me,” Slovis said of the Trojans’ slow start. “I didn’t do my job and wasn’t very disciplined and missed a lot of opportunities, but I think the biggest thing was just not making those mistakes worse and turning the ball over. That kept us in the game, and our defense did a great job getting us the ball back.”
The offensive effort was further aided by senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr., who displayed his athleticism by carrying an Arizona defensive back into the end zone for USC’s first touchdown. He also came back to catch an underthrown pass for a 54-yard reception that set up the Trojans’ third touchdown of the game.
In the short week ahead of Friday’s game against Colorado, the Trojans will have little time to get healthy and are counting on Saturday’s contributors to step up again against the Buffaloes.
