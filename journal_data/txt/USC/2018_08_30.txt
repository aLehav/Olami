When USC takes the field against UNLV on Saturday, the team will be led by four senior captains — offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn, safety Marvell Tell III, middle linebacker Cam Smith and outside linebacker Porter Gustin. 
For the first time since 2013, a quarterback was not selected as a captain. 
All four 2018 captains have experienced highs and lows during their respective careers with the Trojans. They all arrived when the program was in a difficult position, with head coach Steve Sarkisian being fired midway through 2015. 
Yet, they head into their final seasons as Rose Bowl and Pac-12 Champions, looking to add to their hardware. 
Lobendahn immediately made an impact upon joining USC in Spring 2014. Known for his versatility, Lobendahn started all 13 games as a true freshman while playing left guard and left tackle. Many took notice of his early success, and he was named a first team Freshman All-American by several publications. 
However, the next two seasons were trying for the Cerritos, Calif. native. As a sophomore, he was sidelined for seven games with a torn left ACL. In the 2016 season opener against Alabama, misfortune struck Lobendahn once again when he tore his right ACL in the first quarter. 
Unaware of his injury at the time, Lobendahn played the rest of the Alabama game. But he would miss the team’s nine-game winning streak and Rose Bowl triumph, receiving a medical redshirt in order to preserve eligibility. 
In 2017, Lobendahn returned to the field and reasserted himself as one of the Pac-12’s premier offensive linemen. He started 13 games at left tackle, protecting quarterback Sam Darnold’s blindslide en route to a Pac-12 Championship. The 6-foot-3, 295-pound lineman earned All Pac-12 Second Team honors. 
This year, Lobendahn leads the team as a fifth-year senior, projecting to start at center. Over his career, he’s started 34 games at four different positions — left tackle, left guard, center and right guard. 
The three defensive captains — Smith, Tell and Gustin — were all members of the 2015 recruiting class, which ranked No. 1 in the nation, according to Rivals. 
Smith didn’t waste any time before making his mark in Cardinal and Gold. Against Utah as a true freshman, Smith snagged three interceptions, returning one for a pivotal 54-yard touchdown. In the process, he willed the Trojans to an upset victory over the then-No. 3 ranked Utes. His performance garnered widespread attention, as Smith was named the National and Pac-12 Player of the Week. But Smith tore his ACL just three weeks later in a victory against Colorado that cut his phenomenal freshman season short. 
Based on the Utah game alone, Smith’s name would forever be etched in Trojan lore. But Smith is no one-hit wonder. He’s led the squad in tackles each of the past two seasons, even adding another interception against Utah in 2017.
As a junior last season, Smith further solidified himself as the rock of USC’s defense. He set career highs in total tackles (112) and tackles for loss (11.0). He was an All-Pac-12 first team selection. Despite favorable draft grades, Smith elected to return for his senior season.
“I felt like myself as well as the team had a lot more to prove,” Smith said at Pac-12 Media Day in July. “It just felt right, it felt perfect and I’m glad I did it.” 
USC’s only returning captain from last season, Smith has been vocal about his passions off the football field. Last summer, he worked at a winery in Northern California. He plans to pursue a career in winemaking once he hangs up his cleats. 
Tell has been a steady presence in the Trojans’ secondary since arriving on campus in 2015. His first year was cut short by a broken collarbone, but he still managed 36 tackles as a true freshman.
Since then, the Pasadena native has tallied four career interceptions, 128 total tackles and 4.5 tackles for loss. In 2017, he memorably returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown against Western Michigan, helping the Trojans seal a victory with three minutes left. 
The hard-hitting yet sneaky athletic safety made the All-Pac-12 first team in 2017, alongside Smith. 
Gustin rounds out the quartet. The Utah-born outdoorsman is the Trojans’ most fearsome pass rusher, having totaled 14 sacks and 23 tackles for loss in his career. Regarded as a physical specimen by players and coaches alike, Gustin is looking to finish his college career on a high note, having missed most of last season due to a broken toe and torn bicep. 
Even in limited action, Gustin recorded three sacks in 2017. Early in fall practice, Gustin had another injury scare, this time suffering a torn meniscus after a collision. He has recently returned to practice, and the team expects he will play in the season opener. 
Lobendahn, Smith, Tell and Gustin have combined for 115 starts over their careers. They begin the final chapter of their USC careers this Saturday against UNLV.

The Trojans face a tough test this weekend as they travel to Florida to face No. 4 Florida State and No. 22 Florida. The Trojans will look to overcome what appears to be the toughest back-to-back series of the season.
USC is coming off an impressive display last weekend when the team added two victories to its record and scored 11 goals in the process. The Trojans moved up in the United Soccer Coaches ranking to No. 7 following their performances against Cal Poly and Pepperdine.
The team’s key player was redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo who was named to the Top Drawer Soccer Team of the Week. She had a fine performance in the attacking midfield position against Cal Poly and notched 2 goals against Pepperdine over the weekend.
“I thought [DeMelo] was really good. She’s got great ability to break people down and dribble,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the Cal Poly game. “But I want to see her connect more passes and be a little bit more dangerous on the pass, but all in all, she’s our 10 and she plays that way for sure.”
The front three partnership of DeMelo, redshirt junior Natalie Jacobs and senior striker Leah Pruitt has proven to be one of the best in the country. Pruitt has done a great job running the channels and creating open spaces to score or assist goals while Jacobs has impressed by being in the right place to create opportunities to score and work hard off the ball. DeMelo has done her job linking up plays from the top of the midfield to create even more opportunities for Pruitt and Jacobs, as well as creating spaces for other midfielders like sophomore Tara McKeown.
“I think [DeMelo and I] work really well off each other,” Pruitt said over the weekend. “We work hard for each other too. And I think having [Jacobs] up top too will be a really good addition. I think we’ll be a cool little trifecta.”
Moreover, senior defender and captain Ally Prisock has looked very composed at the back so far this season. Prisock was named to the MAC Hermann Trophy watch list at the start of the season. She looks to maintain solidity at the back and prevent teams from playing any kind of counter-attacking soccer.
The Women of Troy will battle the No. 4 Seminoles on Friday at 4 p.m. Like USC, the Seminoles have started the season undefeated with four wins in a row. Most recently, the Seminoles took on Middle Tennessee and Wisconsin and comfortably won each game, 3-0. 
On Sunday, the Trojans will travel to Gainesville, Fla. to take on the Florida Gators at 3 p.m. Unlike the Seminoles, the Gators lost their last two games to Ohio State and Oklahoma State. They were ranked No. 5 prior to those games, and now face three ranked opponents including USC. 
“Florida State is always really organized and [a] very technical [team],” McAlpine said. “They have the ability to break you down with the pass, which I think is very unique with teams. We are going to have to be very sharp in our defending and communicate really well to stop them. And Florida is not that different […] Both teams are going to be very, very good opponents that we are going to have to be sharp and they’re really going to test us.”
While the Trojans face tough opponents on the road, they look to continue on their impressive form and stay undefeated when they return to Los Angeles.

Sophomore safety Bubba Bolden will not start on Saturday, Helton said. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
No. 15 USC’s final practice before the start of the regular season brought with it a number of personnel updates for Saturday’s season opener against UNLV.
Head coach Clay Helton walked into the post-practice press conference with a crumpled slip of paper in hand. On it lay the names of sophomore outside tackle Austin Jackson, senior linebacker Porter Gustin and redshirt senior tackle Toa Lobendahn, among others.
Jackson will probably play, Helton said. Gustin might. Lobendahn is questionable. But the biggest name who will miss Saturday’s game will be starting safety Bubba Bolden, who is out of the lineup due to an undisclosed reason.
“From a personnel standpoint, Bolden is not going to be available for the UNLV game Saturday,” Helton said at the press conference. “There’s no timetable for his return, and I can’t comment further at this time.”
Until Helton made the announcement, it was believed that Bolden would make the first start of his career at safety against the Rebels.
When pressed, Helton did not speak further.
“Like I said, I have no comment further at this time right now,” he said.
Redshirt freshman Isaiah Pola-Mao will start in Bolden’s place, Helton said, and redshirt sophomore C.J. Pollard and freshman Talanoa Hufanga will back him up.
Pola-Mao redshirted his freshman year, and will get his first career start come Saturday.
Hufanga, a true freshman from Crescent Valley High School in Oregon, might see action in his first-ever game as a Trojan as a result of Bolden’s absence. He finished his 2017 season with 44 tackles — seven of which were for a loss — a fumble recovery, and 35 receptions for a total of 696 yards. 
More injuries
Helton did provide details on other key injuries the Trojans have heading into the season, beginning with Jackson.
“I know that from an injury standpoint we were talking about Jackson yesterday,” Helton said. “He looked very good today. Anticipate him playing in the game.”
The 6-foot-6 sophomore only saw action in four games during his freshman campaign, but is slated to play against the Rebels after injuring his ankle during the offseason. 
Gustin’s name was also on the list, but Helton wasn’t quite as dead-set on the outside linebacker, who is still recuperating from a torn meniscus suffered on the third day of summer training camp. 
“Gustin looked very good again,” Helton said. “We will evaluate later.” 
He left out whether Gustin will see playing time on Saturday, which will likely be determined Friday according to Helton.
Lobendahn, on the other hand, is still being evaluated with a pectoral strain.
“Lobendahn did not practice today, still questionable for the game,” Helton said. “[He is] not looking as good as [Gustin or Jackson].”
Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m. at the Coliseum on Saturday.

Every change is undoubtedly going to be met with supporters and haters. However, it seems as if the ongoing changes to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum have overwhelmingly drawn criticism. 
I attended the media tour of the Coliseum renovations on Aug. 15 and was fortunate to see some of the changes USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann eagerly announced. A lot of what I saw and heard interested me — viewing terraces, new seats, better press area, new food options — all of these changes sounded pretty good. But when I wrote the article reporting on these changes, commenters on the Daily Trojan site were not shy about their disapproval. 
“Could be worse, although not sure how,” one commenter wrote. “What kind of institution REMOVES 10,000 of the BEST SEATS in the house — forever!”
Growing up in a Michigan suburb, I never had the pleasure of regularly enjoying a historic stadium. Those in Detroit aren’t necessarily recognized as “must-see” stadiums. My relationship with the Coliseum only began last fall when I stepped inside for the first time to watch the USC vs. Western Michigan game last season. I didn’t grow up watching Reggie Bush, OJ Simpson, Matt Leinart or Troy Polamalu tear it up on the Coliseum turf. I didn’t watch “The Comeback.” I wasn’t alive for the two sets of Olympic Games it hosted. The Coliseum’s illustrious past was virtually invisible to me and perhaps that’s why the renovations don’t bother me that much.
Nevertheless, I do recognize that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is one of the most renowned stadiums in the world. Its name is on the same level as venues like the Rose Bowl, Wrigley Field and Madison Square Garden. After all, how many stadiums have hosted two Olympic Games and two Super Bowls? The answer is only one: the Coliseum. It is USC and the city of Los Angeles’ duty to preserve the history and integrity of this monumental venue. However, that doesn’t mean the stadium should stand stagnant. 
First and foremost, there was a lot of hardware that needed to be updated. Electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems all needed to be replaced, and thank God they have improved the Wi-Fi connectivity throughout the stadium. I don’t think any of those changes are being questioned. 
However, as mentioned by the commenter, the real point of contention is replacing all the seats. USC football games hardly ever sell out. It’s a hard issue to pick a side on. On one hand, you lose 10,000 prime seats. On the other, you gain a great concourse area with loge areas and suite-style seating. 
I stand with USC on this issue. It’s imperative that the Coliseum receives updates, and I think the soon-to-come concourse area and terraces will only enhance fan experience. The Coliseum didn’t lose the Olympic torch, the massive arches or the grand entrance. Those aspects of the venue are essential to its identity and should never be taken away. In the grand scheme of things, the changes to the Coliseum do not affect its historicity. The 10,000 seats lost have a minimal impact on the stadium. I’m willing to sacrifice a few thousand seats if it means improving the fan experience.
However, I still can’t get over the name change. I understand that the naming rights were sold in order to fund the much needed renovations, but unlike a lot of unsponsored stadium names, the name “Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum” has significance. The stadium was first dedicated to the L.A. veterans of World War I, before it was rededicated to include all World War I veterans in 1968. Adding the United Airlines name taints the sanctity of this memorial act. I have no doubt that fans will still refer to the soon-to-be United Airlines Memorial Coliseum as “The Coliseum.” I won’t enjoy seeing the new name plastered on the Coliseum walls.
All in all, I think fans will warm up to the changes. It will take some getting used to, but it’s a small price to pay for the advancements that will renew our beloved Coliseum while preserving its legacy.

The Doheny, Leavey and Von KleinSmid Center libraries will require students and community members to present valid identification to enter the space starting on Sept. 4, according to an announcement from USC Libraries Dean Catherine Quinlan. Those without a university ID must present government-issued identification, or an ID from another school, until the standard 9 p.m. cut-off. Previously, students only had to scan their cards after 9 p.m.
Presenting a form of identification may seem like the easiest way to bolster security, but in reality it is the least efficient way to do so, especially in an active shooter situation. Requiring a plastic card at the library front desk is a passive and ineffective solution to valid security concerns. The changing security policies only inconveniences students, and does little to prevent threatening situations. The policy also weeds out individuals who face institutional barriers to accessing an government-issued ID, and makes it easier for the University to identify and distinguish them from students.
The only thing a formal identification document offers is the illusion of safety; it suggests credibility and association with an issuing institution, whether it be USC, another school or the government. But they only guarantee that a person possesses credibility at the time of issuance. 
The possibility of a mass shooting is a primary security concern within many academic settings, and USC’s campus is not exempt. Security must be a major priority, but mass shootings will not be avoided with stricter accessibility rules into university buildings. 
Perpetrators of the deadliest university mass shootings in American history have been former or current students of that institution. 
The top two deadliest university shootings in American history — at Virginia Tech and the University of Texas at Austin —  were conducted by current or former students who had access to campus areas or presented false identification.
Seung-Hui Choi, a then-Virginia Tech University senior, began his shooting rampage in a co-ed residence hall, which he had access to with a scannable key card. Choi fatally shot two people in the residence hall before murdering 30 more students and faculty, as well as wounding 17, in an engineering building.
Charles Whitman, a former University of Texas, Austin student, obtained a parking permit by showing false identification as a research assistant, three years after leaving the school. Whitman was then able to enter the school’s observation deck, where he shot and killed 15 people, including an unborn child, and injuring 31 others — with a  final victim dying 48 years later from wounds sustained in the attack. 
It is no coincidence that these deadly shootings were conducted by former or current students, specifically students who presented a form of valid identification. Identification is the easiest and most arbitrary form of credibility, since it brings peace of mind while never truly guaranteeing the safety that students, faculty and other university community members deserve. 
The best practice for library safety is providing thoroughly trained and vetted on-site security personnel, according to the Library Journal. To combat students who may experience justified discomfort with security personnel nearby, security officials should be properly trained to provide an inclusive and safe environment for students.  Safety resources should also be posted on all visible areas in library buildings so students can immediately get help.
While administration may have approved the decision to provide identification for all the right reasons, the concept of campus safety is a tightrope. They should tread lightly, being careful to prevent both on-campus injustice and fatal tragedy. If the University truly wants to invest in the improved campus security, requiring a simple flash of ID badges is insufficient, and more decisive measures must be taken.

On Tuesday, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso announced the creation of a search committee to aid in the selection of USC’s next president. The 23-person committee includes faculty, trustees, the School of Cinematic Arts dean and Interim President Wanda Austin but notably lacks student representatives. 
The choice to exclude students from this process is a major misstep on the Board’s part; administrators must respect student voices and provide students with a direct channel to influence the election of a new University leader.
Barring students from this key group is a huge mistake at best and an incident of conscious discrimination at worst. The 45,000 students at USC are the face and future of this school and make up the bulk of the academic community — not senior leaders and trustees. The livelihood and wellbeing of students are directly tied to the action — and inaction — the administration takes. The new president, whoever they may be, will impact the lives of students far more than the lives of the adults who are currently on the committee. It does not make sense that 23 people were given the responsibility of speaking for all students when we are perfectly capable of speaking for ourselves. 
In his letter to the University, Caruso explained that students and other members of the community are invited to attend town hall-style sessions where they can share recommendations to aid the committee in its search. Yet, in light of the University’s failure to take inclusionary action, the town halls feel like a hollow statement, a consolation prize offered up in place of actual representation. Students deserve more respect than a half-assed forum that is open to everyone. Our voices should be treated as more important than those from the general public. If the administration truly intends to ameliorate the school’s toxic culture, these town halls are insufficient and unacceptable. 
On Wednesday, Caruso told the Daily Trojan that “the voice of the students is critically important” but that they also can’t have “an unlimited amount of people” participating in the search committee. This is a weak excuse. It should not be difficult for the committee to shirk a few trustee voices — who, with 13 people on the committee, already comprise the majority of seats — in favor of at least one student representative. 
In discussions of USC leadership, the voices of students are always mysteriously silenced. Our needs, desires and concerns are overshadowed by trustees and administrators who, though their hearts may be in the right place, are fundamentally disconnected from our experience. 
Kristopher Coombs, Jr., a Graduate Student Government vice president, said that students began advocating for student representation at the trustee level weeks before the presidential search began. Both GSG and Undergraduate Student Government requested one student seat each on the search committee — upsettingly, neither request was fulfilled. The fact that students took clear steps to demand representation and were still left out exemplifies that the University is guilty not only of oversight but of blatantly ignoring student needs. 
Including students in the discussion is hardly a novel concept. Michigan State University is also reeling from a scandal that forced its president out after Larry Nassar, a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and the school, was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting his patients. Katherine Rifiotis, the student body president, is one of the members on Michigan State’s search committee. Several prominent universities, such as Duke, Stanford and Scripps, have also sought to include student voices in their presidential searches. It makes sense to have a representative chosen by the student population in the room — but at USC, neither USG President Debbie Lee nor GSG President Joycelyn Yip will be given that opportunity.
In addition, Michigan State’s search committee website is sleek, open and detailed. There is a timeline of important steps in the process, from when candidates will be identified (Nov. 2018 – Jan. 2019) to when the new president will be announced (June 2019). There are many updates on the search process and a full list of the committee members and their occupations. USC’s search committee page pales in comparison. There is no timeline — only a short statement, a page to share thoughts on the process and a list of vague FAQs. A university as large as USC should be far more transparent to the public and to, as Caruso put it, “its constituents.”
After a rolling tide of scandals, it seemed like C. L. Max Nikias’ exit from the presidential office was a step toward change. Lots of rhetoric was tossed around about “transparency” and “healing,” but this exclusionary decision detracts from those promises, rendering them empty. Leaving students out of the discussion feels like something is being hidden from us, and the University cannot preach transparency and then refuse to give students a seat at the table. Students are the lifeblood of this institution, and it is deeply frustrating to find our voices silenced once again.

The USC Institute for Global Health held an event on Wednesday to discuss the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the HIV epidemic and human rights. 
The event is part of the “Wicked Problems” multi-disciplinary practicum, a hands-on course for select USC students to tackle local issues of health, inequality and sustainability, but the seminar was open to the public.
Mandeep Dhaliwal, director of the United Nations Development Programme HIV, Health and Development Group was joined by Jeffrey O’Malley, former director of UNICEF’s Division of Data, Research, and Policy.
Dhaliwal, a physician and lawyer, joined the United Nations Development Programme in 2008, and spearheaded the creation of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. Her work focuses on HIV/AIDS research, care and human rights issues in countries like Africa and India. 
Dhaliwal outlined the UN’s 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which was adopted in 2015 by 193 member countries. 
“The Sustainable Development Goals are 17 interconnected goals with 169 targets,” Dhaliwal said. “The SDGs are much more narrowly focused … and the agenda is universal and indivisible.” 
Zero hunger, gender equality and clean water and sanitation are a few examples of the broad goals the organization hopes to achieve. While they are broad in language, the SDGs serve as a guiding framework for global cooperation, according to Dhaliwal. 
“[HIV] is one of the wicked problems of global health,” Dhaliwal said. “The global response has been remarkable on a number of fronts …  [demonstrating] the power of human rights and solidarity across governments.” 
O’Malley specifically  commented on the diseases’ impact on the LGBTQ community. 
“Why are queer people and queer issues linked to the SDGs?,” O’Malley said. “We need to understand how the SDG framework works for people with disabilities, queer people, migrants. Looking at these marginalized groups is a way to test whether this framework works for everybody.” 

Global health is rooted in a history of marginalization, he said. 

“The roots of global health are not altruistic. They were not about helping marginalized people or poor people,” O’Malley said. 

The event attracted both graduate and undergraduate students from all fields of study. Jake Anderson, a sophomore studying global health, attended the talk to hear about issues not discussed in the classroom. 

“We are future leaders in this profession,” Anderson said. “I think it’s interesting to see the progress that is trying to be made and to use that to see what it is I want to do with my life.” 

Sofia Gruskin, the director of the USC Institute for Global Health and a professor of preventative medicine and law, noted that both speakers were able to blend their passions with strategic thinking. 

“[The speakers] move policy and programs in the UN [and] work with governments and civil society around the world,” Gruskin said. “The world is a more inclusive and open place because of their work.”

Dr. Robert Kozinets, Jayne and Hans Hufschmid Chair of Strategic Public Relations at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, teamed with Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group from Washington, D.C. to conduct research in 10 countries to analyze social media and its hashtags regarding possible  cigarette brand marketing.
In 1970, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act was passed to deregulate cigarette advertising by the tobacco industry. However, instead of television and radio ads, tobacco industries are turning to social media to market their products. 
“The laws really only cover television, radios, newspapers and magazines,” Kozinets said. “They don’t cover social media, and [tobacco companies] are managing to find a way around those limitations because the laws are so slow-moving.”
After five months, the research revealed that some social media users have been paid by tobacco companies or compensated with gifts. The researchers also found that certain parties that had free alcohol and giveaways were encouraging attendees to post pictures of themselves in addition to cigarette logos and design elements, resembling cigarette packages, which were in the background of many photos. 
“They noticed that tobacco companies seemed to be using social media and having a lot of postings by young people talking about parties and doing interesting things featuring cigarettes,” Kozinets said. “They knew that something was going on in a bunch of countries but they weren’t exactly sure what, so they contacted me to do some research with them around the world.”
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids decided to launch a petition with the Federal Trade Commission to start spreading the word. 
“I think students at USC and elsewhere need to be very aware that there’s a lot of money at stake when they start smoking as students,” Kozinets said. “When you get someone to start when they’re young, they are a smoker for life. Tobacco companies know this, and that’s why they’ve been made to promise that they weren’t going to advertise, but for some reason, our legislation has not kept up with the fact that influencers in social media are a form of advertising.”
According to Kozinets, the University tries to emphasize moral and ethical elements in academics. For example, it offers a course based on ethical marketing. 
“In the real world, that doesn’t always happen,” Kozinets said. “You get a lot of gray areas where companies do the unethical things rather than the ethical things, and this study points out how important it is for us to do research that can reveal what’s really going on in these areas because it’s really hard to piece it together.”

Following the Medical Board of California’s decision to temporarily suspend former USC gynecologist George Tyndall’s medical license, attorneys suing the doctor and the University lauded the Board for its decision to keep him from seeing patients.
In May, Tyndall was accused of sexual abusing patients during gynecology appointments at the student health center for several decades. Most recently, he agreed to the interim suspension of his medical license, rather than waiting for a full hearing on Friday. This temporary suspension will last until the Medical Board issues a final decision regarding his license, according to legal documents.
Tyndall’s attorney Peter Osinoff did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Lawyers such as John Manly, who defended gymnasts abused by U.S. Olympic doctor Larry Nasser, and Gloria Allred, a prominent lawyer known for defending high-profile women in similar cases, are now representing hundreds of women in suits against the University and Tyndall.
Both were supportive of the decision to bar his license. 
“I’m glad he’s off the street in terms of practicing medicine, but it’s very, very sad that it took over 30 years, and, at this point, over 400 women have come forward to report that they were assaulted or harassed by him,” Manly said.
Daniella Mohazab, a graduate student and alleged victim of Tyndall, said at a press conference that she “cried tears of happiness and relief” when she found out about Tyndall’s medical license suspension.
“In the past few weeks, I have continued to hurt,” she said. “This has not been an easy process, but our work is paying off.”
With the suspension, Tyndall is unable to practice medicine, advertise himself as a physician or supervise physician assistants while the order is in effect. He is also barred from prescribing medication.
“The medical board doesn’t suspend your license unless they suspect you did something wrong,” Manly said. “The notion that this is all a big misunderstanding, I think that’s out the window.” 
Tyndall was also required to turn in his wall and wallet certificates along with prescriptions blanks and Drug Enforcement Agency order forms and permits, according to the documents.
A brief from the California Attorney General’s office that argued for the suspension of Tyndall’s medical license included declarations from five students who are clients of Allred. The women shared information about the alleged sexual misconduct they experienced with Tyndall. Mohazab and Anika Narayanan were two of those who spoke out.
“I am so encouraged by this recent decision and have nothing but pride and gratitude for every person who has been a participant in this narrative, Narayanan said. “Each and every woman who is linked by this shared experience and each and every person who listened to us and appreciated this experience as serious, wrong and perhaps most critically, valid.”
On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is preparing new policies  regarding sexual misconduct on campuses. The new policies aim to narrow the definition of sexual harassment so that schools are only held accountable for formal complaints and instances that occur on campus. There will also be higher legal standards to evaluate whether universities address complaints properly, the Times reported.
USC did not respond regarding these new rules by time of publication. However, Board of Trustees Chair Rick Caruso addressed how the University is currently dealing with accusations of misconduct against Tyndall in an interview Tuesday. 
“The University is responding to the lawsuits that have been filed,” he said. “I feel strongly that these are our students, they are patients. We need to do right by them and treat them fairly and through this process of the lawsuit, this is going to be our goal. Get this chapter of their life and the University’s life closed.”

Noticing the growing popularity of neon signs adorning the walls of local Los Angeles establishments, Carissa Brones, who is pursuing a Master of Science in entrepreneurship, and Warren Weiss, a Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising alumnus, founded startup Good Life Neon to contribute to the trend.
Launched in July, the company designs and produces custom neon signs for its clients. To grow the brand, Brones and Weiss have been advertising to bars, restaurants and stores. Thus far, Good Life Neon has created two signs: one for a birthday party and one for Sugar Lemon Water spa. 
“We want to make the signs part of the design of the place and also something people think is really pretty and want to take pictures,” Brones said. “A lot of…destinations now have something that makes them attractive and you go not for the store but to take the picture. We’re really playing into that appeal.”
Brones and Weiss met at an Equinox gym over a year ago, and have been close friends since. They were inspired to create neon signs when they saw how well they were selling at the store Weiss used to work at. 
After taking two entrepreneurship classes at USC Marshall School of Business during the last semester of senior year, Brones was convinced to start a business. According to Brones, launching a startup had already in the back of her mind as she knew the venture would encourage independence and creativity.
Good Life Neon Company accepts commissions, creates sign designs and sends them to a third-party manufacturer. Brones and Weiss are hoping to work with businesses in Los Angeles and eventually branch out into multiple cities. Their current project includes developing a sign for a bar in Palm Springs. 
The business is also working on building an Instagram following and a stronger digital brand.
In the future, Brones hopes to own a fitness center while Weiss aspires to start a clothing boutique. The Good Life Neon co-founders aspire to familiarize themselves with popular brands in their chosen fields by designing signs for them. 
“A lot of entrepreneurs that you’ll talk to, they’ll say … if you want to know what it’s like, start your own business and get out there and learn everything on your own,” Brones said. “And it’s true. In the real world, when you have to do things on your own …you’re out there and have to figure things out as they go.”
While Brones and Weiss consider the company a side project for the time being, they are hoping it expands and appeals to the brands they look up to. Brones believes that leading this business will be a learning experience and a good career opportunity.

Former USC quarterback Sam Darnold, the third-overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft, will most likely be the starter for the Jets. (Daily Trojan file photo)
Former USC quarterback Sam Darnold will be the starting quarterback for the New York Jets for the Week 1 matchup against the Detroit Lions on Sept. 10, according to the NFL Network. He is the youngest quarterback to start a season opener in NFL history, at 21 years and 97 days old. 
Darnold was the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, coming off a successful career at USC. In 2016, he led the Trojans to a nine-game win streak and a legendary Rose Bowl victory against Penn State. As a redshirt freshman, Darnold pulled off a 52-49 win to claim the title surrounded by current Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Ronald Jones II and Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Juju Smith-Schuster. 
In his two years at USC, he threw for a total of 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns. He constantly struggled with turnovers but could still manage to pull off the win. Darnold’s USC career ended with a disappointing Cotton Bowl appearance where the Trojans were defeated 24-7 by Ohio State.
When the NFL Draft rolled around, there was a high probability of Darnold going as the No. 1 pick to the Cleveland Browns; but the Browns went with Heisman Trophy winner and Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield instead. The Jets took Darnold to become their next franchise player, and he was immediately placed in the New York spotlight to impress the coaches over the summer. 
“He’s everything you’re looking for in a young quarterback as far as the ability to go out there, and the game isn’t too big for him,” Jets offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates told ESPN after preseason Week 3. “The stage isn’t too big for him. Really, when the lights come on, he gets better.”
Darnold came out in the first two preseason games ready to show off his talent. In Week 1 of the preseason against the Atlanta Falcons, he led the team to a 17-0 win by throwing 96 yards and completing 13-of-18 passes. He topped off his debut by throwing his first NFL touchdown. Preseason Week 2 was less of a show, as Darnold compiled only 62 yards, one interception and no touchdowns. The rookie put up a 64.4 percent completion rate for 244 yards with two total touchdowns in preseason so far. Darnold has always had a calming presence on the field and an impressive ability to make reads, both areas in which he impressed the Jets staff. 
Darnold’s preseason starts were strong hints that he would take the starting spot, but it became obvious when quarterback Teddy Bridgewater was traded to the New Orleans Saints on Wednesday. New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles and his staff expect to make the decision official after Thursday, when the Jets play the Philadelphia Eagles in their final preseason game.

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team will head to the Bubly Water Invitational Tournament in Gainesville, Fla. to take on No. 4 Florida Friday. 
After celebrating their Trojan Invitational championship last weekend, the Trojans now face their first road test of the season. Playing away from home is always challenging; doing so against the runner-ups in last season’s NCAA championship is even more so. Though Florida, like USC, has a roster full of freshmen this year, those players have proved impressive early on. Freshman outside hitter Thayer Hall was named SEC Freshman of the Week for her performance in the Gators’ second place VERT challenge finish last weekend, recording 41 kills and 21 digs in the two games played and earning All-Tournament honors. Florida also has the luxury of being the tournament hosts and playing in front of its home crowd, something USC enjoyed in its first three games. 
That being said, head coach Brent Crouch appears to be taking a larger perspective in terms of what the next few games for his squad will mean.
“These players can be fantastic. They don’t know how good they can be,” Crouch said on USC’s Trojans Live radio station. “If you hold this mirror up to them, ‘This is what you can be,’ when you do X, Y and Z, they’ll be with you. I think we’ve got an incredible group of players that are playing right now. The talent level is there and the athleticism is there for this team to do really well, but I think we’re gonna unleash them once they get some new habits in place.”
Florida, much like USC, was pushed to five sets in its championship game last week, falling 10-15 in the final frame. However, each frame was relatively close  (18-25, 25-21, 25-21, 21-25, 10-15), as they were in USC’s match (28-26, 23-25, 25-22, 21-25, 18-16). Both teams should be feeling confident heading into the match, with Florida hoping to take the next step and close out tight games and USC attempting to build upon the momentum of its three-game winning streak.
Crouch will look for the strong play and leadership of star junior outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who earned Trojan Invitational MVP honors and sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin, the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week, to set the tone for his young group in a hostile environment. Freshman setter Raquel Lázaro, the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week, will also have to keep up with the Gators’ dynamic duo of freshman Marlie Monserez and redshirt senior Allie Monserez, who combined for 57 assists in their last game against Texas. Crouch certainly isn’t letting last week’s success get to the team’s head.
“It was great to have a great weekend right away, but there’s a lot of room to grow with this group this year,” Crouch said. “I expect us to be clicking at a much higher level at the end of the season.”

When JT Daniels starts under center Saturday he will become the second Trojan quarterback after Matt Barkley to start Week 1 as a true freshman. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
With just two days left until the season opener, the football team is focused on containing UNLV’s dynamic offense, led by star redshirt sophomore Armani Rogers, last season’s Mountain West freshman of the year.
“One of the biggest keys for us is gonna be able to contain the quarterback,” head coach Clay Helton said. “When you watch tape on Armani, it’s evident that if you don’t stay in your lanes … he can hurt you dearly. His ability to move the chains is something special.”
Rogers threw for 1,471 yards and six touchdowns to five interceptions, but he especially shined on the move, rushing for 780 yards and eight scores. As a team, UNLV likes to play up-tempo and push the pace. The Runnin’ Rebels averaged 427.1 yards per game last season but also ceded 458.7 yards to their opponents, 239.1 of which were on the ground. The keys for USC will be to limit Rogers’ ability to get outside the pocket and create big plays with his feet, as well as testing UNLV’s run defense early to open up the field and help out freshman quarterback JT Daniels in his first start. 
Helton is excited to get going. 
“The beauty about ’SC is the expectations of being here in the first game and the expectations that this group has to take the new step,” Helton said. “These seniors, that have done so much in their last two years, to be able to walk back in that Coliseum is exciting. We’ve been hitting each other now for the last four weeks. We’re ready to go play somebody.”
Porter’s health
Senior captain and outside linebacker Porter Gustin spoke to reporters following practice about his recovery from a torn meniscus and his status for Saturday’s matchup. 
“I was pretty certain that it wasn’t super bad. I didn’t feel anything pop or tear … just couldn’t put pressure on it,” Gustin said. “I was lucky it was just a meniscus.” 
Helton agreed with Gustin’s assessment.
“I think he looked good to really good,” Helton said. “I thought the big day was yesterday, to get some really physical work … The doctors felt great about it.” 
Gustin is looking to bounce back from an injury-ridden season that saw him appear in only appear in four games. In limited time, Gustin showcased his versatility and pass rushing ability, most notably by delivering two sacks in the first half last year in USC’s triple overtime thriller against Texas before exiting the game. This time around, Gustin isn’t taking anything for granted.
“I’m just looking forward to competition, getting out there, playing with my guys, and enjoy football,” Gustin said. “Unless something really bad happens, I plan on playing. I’m feeling good and ready to go.” 
Bubba balls out 
Quarterback wasn’t the only position that saw some competition this past training camp. Defensive backs sophomore Bubba Bolden and senior Marvell Tell III went head-to-head in a tight battle for the starting safety job before Helton named Bolden the winner at the start of the week. The game is especially meaningful for Bolden, who will be starting against his former head coach at Bishop Gorman High, Tony Sanchez, who now coaches the Runnin’ Rebels. 
“I was kind of surprised when it happened (Sanchez was hired in 2014),” Bolden said on Sanchez making the rare jump from high school to college head coach. “But I think he was the best coach in Vegas. He got that role, and I think he’s doing a pretty good job.” 
Bolden, who didn’t play much outside of special teams last season, also spoke about his development since joining the program.
“I personally think it was a good thing for me,” Bolden said. “It was a good learning experience my freshman year. Just getting to learn the game and the speed of the game … I think I’m ready.” 
Injury update
Freshman running back Markese Stepp was cleared off of concussion protocol. He will not play, according to Helton.

It’s 2018 and Barstool Sports is still a thing. How the heck is that possible?
For at least three years, I haven’t met anyone serious about sports — read: not a guy who plays fantasy and thinks that means he could be a sports reporter — who actually enjoyed Barstool Sports. Some people can appreciate the publication’s success in an ever-changing sports media market, and there’s some quality in its pizza review blog.
But this week, Barstool went too far. It seems silly to say that, given the wide amount of misogyny the site has spouted in the past. However, the publication truly hit a low this week when it posted a series of fabricated quotes by WNBA players.
I’ve written this column before, basically, espousing about the various reasons why Barstool should be left in the past. Barstool has long been a thorn in the side of the sports community, the typical kind of riff raff that turns off normal people from becoming a fan.
Whether it’s sexist Instagram posts (let’s never forget the infamous pumpkin post of last year) or unfunny podcasts that lean too heavily on dude-bro humor, Barstool clings to the hyper-masculine environment that sports are stereotypically known for.
Barstool has pretty much always taken an unofficial stance against women in sports. Yet this bigotry never been quite as deliberate or explicit as it quickly became this week.
Over the past three weeks, Barstool has posted a series of quotes from Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner, Dallas Wings guard Skylar Diggins-Smith and Las Vegas Aces forward Tamera Young. Each of the quotes from the stars echoed common sentiments throughout the league surrounding the disparity of pay between female and male athletes. In these quotes, the players called out NBA athletes by name, criticizing them for lacking talent and making more than their female counterparts.
There were two problems with these quotes. The first is that they were used to defend Barstool’s widespread defense of the pay gap between male and female players. The second is that they were completely fabricated.
Each of the athletes immediately called out the falsities. At one point, Bobby Reagan — the writer of the blog that Griner’s fake quote was attached to — admitted on Twitter that he knew the quote was fake.
“Well aware,” he said in response to a tweet calling out the fake quote. “Not the point of the blog, which addresses [sic] all the issues.”
Reagan goes on to point out that his blog post was meant to defend women’s equality and the team’s fight for increased salaries and benefits in the WNBA. Yet the website still hasn’t taken down its fake quotes, nor has it apologized for libeling several athletes with complete apparent lack of regard for the truth.
What worries me most about this isn’t the website’s continued belligerence toward women in sports, nor is it the increasing popularity that this attitude creates. (Believe me though, those things worry me plenty.) What I find most disturbing about Barstool is the clear lack of emphasis on reporting the truth.
Barstool Sports began as a blog, but it’s become a source for reporting — or at least perceived reporting — for many sports fans. Yet, despite this shift in readership, the publication remains a blog focused less on reporting facts and more on creating entertainment for fans. If this means making up quotes, well, all the better.
I understand why this formula continues to work. Scandalous, controversial — and fake — quotes garner retweets and mentions on Twitter, which result in rampant increases in clicks, even if they’re coming from angry misogynists who want nothing more than to yell about the ignorance of female athletes.
But as Barstool continues to miraculously rise in popularity and prevalence, it needs to accept its new place in the world of sports media. It can remain a blog for dude-bros to argue about whether Jordan or LeBron would win in a one-on-one, and it can continue its proud tradition of weird nicknames and Saturdays being for the boys. 
What Barstool can’t afford, however, is to continue spreading untruths and downright lies just to scrape up a few more clicks. Like it or not, this website has become a source for news and information in sports media. And with the current climate surrounding every type of media outlet, it will do well to avoid adding fuel to the fire of the rapidly rising fear of fake news.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Growing up in Silicon Valley, milk tea was a staple of my daily beverage consumption — I lived in a predominantly Asian area, and the sugary Taiwanese drink is offered at no fewer than 10 shops along a one-mile stretch outside my house. Despite this, the options for bubble tea and all its wild variations in Los Angeles  (Snow Monster’s cotton candy milk tea drink comes to mind) overwhelmed me. Fearing for my health and wary of the sugar coagulating in my bloodstream, I quit the boba life. But caffeination soon proved necessary for a college student like me, and I decided now that I was going off into the adult world, it was time to start drinking adult beverages — namely coffee. I spent my first year at USC in more cafés than classrooms, and along the way I picked up a few tips from baristas, fellow espresso seekers and the black liquid of life itself.
For most, the priority of a café is the coffee. Since Starbucks burgeoned out of Seattle in the 1970s, the West Coast began making a name for itself in third wave coffee production. Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Blue Bottle Coffee, Philz, Verve — all of these cafés are of West Coast origin and are influenced in part from cafe culture in Europe and the growing appreciation of coffee as an art, rather than being for humans what gasoline is for cars. Smaller, locally owned cafés started cropping up all over the Pacific coast, ranging in flavor and style. Chains like Starbucks continue to flourish across the nation, each location imbued with a personality of its own. Cafés are now no longer where only the cleverest minds gather for debate and discussion — they are a stop for the expedient executive, the harried hustler, the basic b-tch and people like me, the stressed student.
Many of the coffee shops in Los Angeles focus on their bean origins, roasting, brewing and presentation. These steps are all important to crafting quality coffee. In assessing a cup of joe, however, everyone has a different flavor preference. World Coffee Research developed the Sensory Lexicon for describing coffee, and most major players in coffee have their own methods of assessing quality and taste. However, there is a clear line between good and bad coffee — my goal is to be able to differentiate that, at the very least. Becoming a coffee sommelier might take more caffeine than my body can handle.
College students comprise a large portion of café-goers. The younger generations influence cafe culture a great deal, and which is reflected in cafe trends and priorities. 
There are factors to look for beyond the quality of coffee. First, there’s the ambiance. Nothing makes a study session more productive than a cozy atmosphere. Catching up with friends is always more emotionally rewarding in the right setting. Lighting, be it natural light from the to ceiling windows or swanky Ikea lamps that resemble a hybrid Death Star, is necessary to get anything done. Unless you enjoy studying in utter darkness — then the SCA basement is a solid move. Or perhaps you’re an aficionado of the sterile, hyper-regulated lighting of Leavey Library (but then, why would you be interested in finding a café?)
There’s also the physical means to productivity — Wi-Fi, power outlets, tables and chairs. Though these things seem to be obvious staples of a cafe, there will always be cafes that lack connection, push for “more human interactions,” encourage us all to bring back “the spirit of the 80s.” In that environment, I could read a lot of books, but I probably wouldn’t be able to finish my essay, complete with research and annotations. There are also cafes notorious for the guy who holes up in the corner, sapping all the internet bandwidth with his endless string of “League of Legends” matches. 
Aside from the people working or chatting away in a café, there is a staff of people who serve up many, many cups of coffee and tea daily. Good customer service is a must. Being a barista can be exhausting — especially when dealing with picky customers. But baristas who manage to make good conversation, or at the very least make customers feel welcome, elevate a cafe beyond average standards. Plus, anyone who can make great latte art deserves some applause. 
This column is an exploration of Los Angeles café culture and what makes the best cafes the best. Though it seems a narrow scope of view, having a cup of coffee is an underrated moment in everyday existence for many people — an instance of the ordinary that can fuel the most extraordinary things.

A graduate of the School of Cinematic Arts, Christovale is currently an assistant curator at the Hammer Museum at UCLA, finishing up her popular exhibition “Made in L.A. 2018.” Christovale has previously explored issues like black womanhood in her works. (Grace Steele | Daily Trojan)
In the first of a series of Roski Talks featuring artists, curators, historians and calligraphers sharing their stories, Erin Christovale, a Los Angeles-based curator at the Hammer Museum, spoke about creating spaces for black experiences, and her current exhibition “Made In L.A. 2018.” 
Students sat patiently on the ground in front of the presentation room, while others stood crowded in the back.  As a prelude to her talk, Christovale projected playwright Bill Gunn’s letter to the editor, titled “To Be a Black Artist,” a work that has motivated her and influenced her curatorial style. Gunn wrote the letter in 1973, after a white critic from The New York Times wrote a scathing review of his movie “Ganja and Hess,” a black vampiric love story.
 As Christovale read the letter, the room erupted with laughter at Gunn’s fiery responses, and his satiric suggestion that “the producers wait anxiously for the black reviewers’ opinions of ‘The Sound of Music’ or ‘A Clockwork Orange.’” The crowd nodded, too, as Gunn’s words resonated: “If I were white, I would probably be called fresh and different. If I were European, ‘Ganja and Hess’ might be ‘that little film you must see.’” 
Christovale graduated from the School of Cinematic Arts in 2010, with a desire to create an artistic space for her lived experiences. Recently, she curated the Hammer’s “Made in L.A. 2018” show, a biennial exhibition that explores the contemporary tone of Los Angeles by showcasing local artists. This year’s show featured a wide variety of installations — from E.J. Hill’s endurance performance to Lauren Halsey’s “The Crenshaw District Hieroglyph Project,” which will become a part of the architecture of South Central L.A. 
Titled, “Collectives, collaborations, and the thoughts that surround me,” Christovale’s Roski Talk began with a cheery picture of her and her friends, all but one alumni from different departments at USC. In 2010, the black creative group formed the collective “Native Thinghood,” a nod to Aldous Huxley’s book “Doors of Perception,” in which plants are described as having “been robbed of their thinghood or essence.” Like the plants, Christovale leveled, “[black people] have been commodified and named different things.” 
In 2013, she was introduced to Amir George, a Chicago-based filmmaker, and  the pair formed “Black Radical Imagination,” a now-international program that provided a space for black filmmakers and visual artists to display their work. The name is an ode to the idea that there had to be some sort of black imagination in order to ever exist outside of racism and oppression and imagine a liberated future. While Christovale no longer curates the program, she praises it as a “rich point of dialogue that continues to grow.”
In 2014, she explored environmental racism with her show “a/wake in the water”; in 2016, the topic at hand was queer black womanhood with “Memoirs of a Watermelon Woman”; and in 2017, she explored black masculinity with “baby boy.” When asked why she settled down at the Hammer after so long, she joked “the first thing I thought was I need healthcare,” but became more serious when talking about her feelings toward working at a predominantly white museum. 
“I’m not here to be a superhero, or be a person who changes an institution,” Christovale said. However, the audience’s unanimous smile made it clear that Christovale’s work continues to be eye-opening and perhaps even revolutionary.

A recent graduate of Cal State Long Beach, Narsiso Martinez discussed his latest exhibition, in which he used discarded produce boxes as his canvas to create stylized portraits of farmworkers. (Sean Flannelly | Daily Trojan)
When he first drew a worker on a discarded produce box, visual artist Narsiso Martinez wanted to contrast the lives of farmworkers and ranch workers. However, he quickly realized the method actually connected farmworkers to the entire agricultural industry.
On Tuesday night, Martinez, a recent graduate from Cal State Long Beach, led a discussion and walkthrough of his exhibition, a collection of portraits of farmworkers on discarded produce boxes at the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles. The USC Fisher Museum of Art and the Consulate organized the “Artist Talk” in collaboration with Art Division, a nonprofit that trains and supports underserved youth interested in visual arts.
“Most of the images that I used for reference are images that I have taken myself all these years since I started working in the fields,” Martinez said. “Some pieces actually depict stories on their own, of certain people that I met.”
Martinez said he helped out in the fields growing up in Oaxaca, Mexico, before immigrating to the United States. When he started college, Martinez said his savings quickly dwindled, requiring him to intermittently return to work in the fields in Washington, where he picked asparagus, cherries and apples.
When Martinez first began painting on produce boxes, he said he wanted to depict experiences different from his own, ultimately deciding to draw a portrait of a banana worker on a banana box. The portrait was very technical, Martinez said, as he felt obligated to portray the images exactly as he saw them, resulting in a less personal piece. After that, he decided to embrace depicting personal experiences and began using his own images he took for most of the portraits.
In the current sociopolitical climate, Martinez’s work has become increasingly relevant, said Maria Galicia, an education and programs coordinator at Fisher Museum and organizer of Tuesday night’s event. Galicia recalls being blown away when she first saw Martinez’s work, especially given her father’s background as an immigrant and farmworker. When the Consulate reached out to find a Oaxacan artist, she said she immediately thought of Martinez.
“I think he’s the perfect person to really show the daily lives of these [farmworkers],” Galicia said. “He lived that, so his work really speaks for itself.”
Although no other events with Martinez are in the works, Tuesday night’s event could be the start of a longer relationship between Martinez and USC Fisher, said Selin Camli, the museum’s communications and marketing administrator. The museum has focused on these types of social issues with some frequency, Camli said, such as the “MONTARlaBestia” exhibition in 2017 and “Dos Colectivos” earlier this year.
Martinez said he wants to raise awareness about the farmworkers, especially given  comments U.S. President Donald Trump has made about the Latino community. Farmworkers represent one part of the Latino community, Martinez said, and he wanted to use his portraits to show how farmworkers contribute a great deal to the nation. Martinez said he does not intend to target any specific produce brands with the exhibition but rather wants to start a conversation about inequity and the agricultural industry as a whole.
“I felt like the [produce box] label would represent the whole agricultural industry and the unfairness, really, of how farmworkers live and how the well-off live,” Martinez said.

“Occupy Me: Branding Culture, Identity and the Politics of Fashion,” an exhibition by Hushidar Mortezaie was on display from Aug. 20 to 30 at the Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery at USC. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
A pioneer of multiple aesthetic movements, Iranian contemporary artist Hushidar Mortezaie is already part of a particular canon — his work has, according to a  press release, contributed to the rise of Middle Eastern and Islamic symbolism in the fashion world and in New Wave Iranian conceptual art, a movement that flourished with the children of Iranian Renaissance at its center. 
His epic collages, featuring striking portraits and traditional Middle Eastern prints and patterns, juxtapose color with black and white, stillness with dynamism and confrontation with introspection. Utilizing text, pattern, paint, photography and more, his work is as multidimensional physically as it is ideologically. Artists’ backgrounds and their respective countries of origin are often brought up in conversations about their work. In the case of Mortezaie, his background is the conversation. 
Having immigrated from Tehran, Iran, to Northern California in 1975, Mortezaie explained that the expression of identity through clothing was always important to him. His journey, which began 24 years ago, involved moving to New York, exposing himself to the local drag scene and being mentored by costume designer Patricia Field. At one point early in his career, he asked himself, “Wait, what about where I’m from?” He cites an “exodus back to Iran” in 1999 as a turning point in his career. During this trip, he saw propaganda art and learned that over half the population was under 30 and that Iran was metropolitan, much like New York City,  in ways that he did not expect.
Mortezaie began the walkthrough of his show with a survey of several fashion pieces — mostly dresses. The artist stated that his original intention was for Iranian women to be recognized as powerful and strong. Intertwining graphic design, screen printing, sewing and painting, Mortezaie believes the fashion industry is now dwindling in craftsmanship due to its focus on fast fashion. The artist is very conscious of the way in which technical immediacy impacts society, half-jokingly stating, “The future has come and we just want to be famous.” 
In the first part of the gallery, Mortezaie intends to show that thought-provoking clothing can also be aesthetically pleasing. He prefaced these works by saying that many magazines have explored “the politics of fashion” by employing headlines such as “Generation Terrorist.” Hoping to subvert racist stereotypes. Mortezaie, as he puts it, wants to move “past the question of the veil — the bottom line is that it should be a choice … not forced … not demonized.” 
The mannequins themselves are positioned in ways that relate to the characters on the garments. The white gown, for instance, features singer Googoosh and the number 678, which is significant to a poem by Forough Farrokhzad. In it, the words of the Iranian national anthem are used to critique monarchy and control. In mounting cultural, social and political references onto his garments, he emphasizes that “fashion, revolution, death —  everything becomes a trend — it’s endless.” His designs are thus art pieces in and of themselves, critiques of sensationalism and commodification.
The title of the show, he explained, denotes, “The various ways that we are occupied… whether it’s systems of control from the East or the West.”
One painting in particular stands out:  A grey-toned painting with subtle notes of pink. It is an act of rebellion against the lack of representation of Iranian men, particularly gay men, as beautiful in the art world. It is a nod to the gay community in Iran, who are not often represented. Thus, the rosiness in the portrait becomes a source of power, reclamation and visibility. To the left of this painting stands another mannequin, half-dressed in garb of Iran’s old regime and half-dressed in contemporary political costume. Gazing at the female mannequins, this figure insinuates that across time and space, women are subject to patriarchal control. 
On the right side of the painting is a mannequin dressed in clothes patterned with newspaper clippings. Mortezaie calls this figure “an ancestor to where we are now,” inspired by a man who openly came out as gay many years ago and was subsequently murdered for it. The next piece features two figures with a soccer net. This symbol of athleticism takes on a special role throughout the show, evoking personal recollections of the artist’s childhood, standing as a symbol of Iranian masculinity and “reverting the gaze onto men.”
The gallery is powerful and intense, but the tension is purposeful. Mortezaie began describing his “red carpet” piece by stating, “I have nationalism — but then I do 
despise nationalism as well.” This work is an exploration of how the media represents Iranian people and the way Iranian people are conscious of the constant battle between representation and Orientalization. Keeping with the artist’s satirical approach, this red carpet piece features a garment with a laundry detergent label-like print that reads “Orientalism makes me Barf.” (“Barf” in Farsi means “snow,” and is also the name of a detergent brand.) 
Next is an installation emulating a store display. The “Paris is Burning” collection, as Mortezaie calls it, is a reference to the film of the same name and the resilience of its characters. The message, he stated, is that one could create without capitalist incentive. The last display, also placed against this wall, features an outfit called “Receipts,” previously worn by model Linda Evangelista in Vogue Italia. Under the guise of Ronald McDonald, this clothing and its display represent the introduction and marketing of hardship into the commercial sphere, something that, according to Mortezaie, is “enslaving us — or enlightening us — depending on how you look at it.”
Having familiarity with so many avenues of classical Iranian origin, contemporary American and other styles including poetry, art, fashion, film and politics — Mortezaie is active within the discourses surrounding what will, for him, always be personal. He does so while subverting expectation and stereotype, staying weary of all implications of his work and simultaneously remaining lighthearted and celebrative of life.
Presented in partnership with USC Roski School of Art and Design, the Farhang Foundation and the USC LGBT Resource Center, “Occupy Me: Branding Culture, Identity & The Politics of Fashion” is on view at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery on the ground floor of Watt Hall. The gallery is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The first USC home football game is Saturday, marking the beginning of tailgating season. Filled with food, music and other festivities, tailgating is a staple of the college football experience, and offers students a way to be closer as a Trojan Family. But, they are not always fun for everyone. The massive crowds, loud noises and strong smells of various foods and drinks can create an overwhelming environment for individuals with sensory processing disorders and prevent them from enjoying an otherwise positive experience. Although they are commonly overlooked, Trojans with sensory processing needs still deserve to experience game day. There are some simple steps that the University can take to advocate for the needs of their peers with SPD.
Sensory processors allow the human nervous system to receive messages from the outside world and respond to these cues accordingly. An individual has a sensory processing disorder when their nervous system cannot interpret and react to the signals from their senses appropriately. Symptoms of SPD fall on a wide spectrum and are surprisingly common. One in six children have sensory symptoms that can impact their everyday lives, according to the STAR Institute for sensory processing disorders. Some people with SPD overreact to stimuli, as loud noises, bright lights or excessive touch can feel overwhelming. Others underreact and therefore feel the need to expose themselves to intense sensory stimuli.
Sensory processing issues can make certain environments uncomfortable, especially when there are crowds involved. For Trojans with sensory processing needs, tailgating on gameday is a difficult task. Between the loud music, juxtaposing smells and different conversations happening at once, someone with SPD may begin to feel overwhelmed and exhausted fairly early on in the day. If they continue to be subjected to too much stimuli, they could experience a panic attack or meltdown; because of these risks, some with the disorder try to avoid these events completely. Others choose to avoid the risk of an embarrassing meltdown and stay home completely.
To foster a more inclusive environment, tailgaters should be aware of the stimuli they put out and be informed of the issues their classmates may be struggling with. The University should invest in signs to put around the tailgating area to limit noise pollution, and create educational materials about SPD. 
The existing tailgating rules — such as ensuring devices don’t play music louder than five feet away — should be followed, but students can still do more. If a tent nearby is already blasting music, students can elect not to play any at theirs. They can also use closed containers for drinks and not leave waste lying around, which can be helpful for those who can’t handle too many smells at once.
The ultimate way the University could help would be by creating an area for people who feel overwhelmed or exhausted at tailgates to go to when they need a break from the stimuli. The area can offer free earplugs, sunglasses or even stress balls for those with sensory processing needs to help them when they do go back to the main tailgating area. It can also be a place where they can fidget as much as they need without questions asked.
Students should also learn to recognize when a person with SPD is becoming agitated and be patient if they have a meltdown. Take deep breaths with them or introduce another form of stimulus, like a hair brush or textured item, to calm them down. If they seem to be a danger to themself or others, remain calm and get out of the area.
For those with SPD, a trustworthy friend is a valuable resource during a tailgate. It’s easy to get lost in gameday’s exhilarating environment, so having someone to keep them grounded and advocate for them in the crowd is helpful. Go over which forms of stimuli can act as triggers beforehand, and carry items that block out stimulus. Having someone who understands and knows what warning signs to look for can also make those with SPD feel more reassured and grounded.
It’s important to remember that sensory processing disorder is normal. There is no need for someone who has it to feel embarrassed or excluded from engaging in college activities. Normalizing SPD and advocating for those who have it can make high-stimulus events like tailgates far more enjoyable.

Joscelyn Stocks | Daily Trojan
As George Washington left the presidential office, he warned his Americans of the dangers of political parties. In his farewell address, he said, “However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”
All the way back in 1796, Washington saw political factions as engines of corrupted power and unnecessary conflict. These engines today, fueled by social media and a controversial administration, propel passionate discussion of American politics. The government is not producing cohesive, effective policy, but is rather at a stalemate because it’s divided into the Republican and Democratic parties. Creating and passing legislation is an arduous task and conflicting opinions between Republicans and Democrats hinders political productivity.
With several government shutdowns in recent decades, the United States is undoubtedly vulnerable to gridlock. 
According to Bill Bishop, author of “The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart,” Democratic and Republican ideologies inversely relate to one another on nearly every political concern pinpointed on a graph, essentially at a ratio of negative one. The two party ideologies contradict one another on nearly every issue at hand.
If there were a middle-ground political ideology, 92 percent of Republicans stand to the right of it and 94 percent of Democrats are positioned to the left of it. The distance measuring this divide has increased by more than 30 percent since 1994, according to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center. The majority of Americans also tend to disdain those who don’t agree with them. Thirty-six percent of Republicans see Democrats as a threat to America’s well-being, whereas 27 percent of Democrats see Republicans as threats. These numbers are not overwhelmingly high, but the fact that they have more than doubled since 1994 is striking. Republican and Democratic ideologies inversely correlate and the majority of affiliates are positioned at these polar opposite ends. Rancorous and zealous crowds are glaring at one another across party lines, in the House of Representatives and, most emblematically, as U.S. President Donald Trump walked into any 2016 presidential campaign event.
Violent screams do not add credibility to the conversation, but I certainly don’t want people to simply agree with my convictions if they see can see flaws in my opinion. I want this criticism to be revealed to me so I can take it into consideration, advance my own knowledge of the situation at hand and potentially formulate a more concrete position. By acknowledging and considering constructive criticism, not only do we increase our amount of information, but we also make progress on developing the best ideas that work for everyone.
Just because I disagree with someone doesn’t mean I don’t seek to learn their perspective because it might open my eyes to new information and help me better understand her objectives. To shut out the opposition is as counterproductive as telling myself that I’m right all the time, which completely stops me from growing and learning.
I grew up in a conservative family, but was also surrounded by a radically liberal group of friends. I know that Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals all have the same goal: to see “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” achieved to the fullest extent as swiftly as possible. We cannot afford to deride one another for our suggestions of different ideas. It is pointless to spend time trying to convince others to agree with us when we do not have a second to spare. It is imperative that not only are we indivisible, but also that we have the public’s full support behind passing the most effective policy at the most highest efficiency.
Regardless of how they plan to achieve prosperity, Americans hope to see the economy thriving, government benefitting its citizens and society blossoming with the fruits of liberty and the seeds of peace. I don’t know when we began to value adherence to our political parties above loyalty to our country, but I dream of a day when we can discuss rather than fight, respect rather than belittle and negotiate instead of preparing for war.
