And the nominations for the MTV Europe Music Awards are in! It seems Lady Gaga, the cross-dressing star of last month’s MTV Video Music Awards here in the good old USA, is leading the pack with a whopping six nominatios.
The prestigious international awards ceremony will be held at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast on Nov. 6. Be sure to tune in —MTV is known for putting on quite a show. Plus, they can do things on European television they can’t do here.
Gaga, nominated due to the hit-packed, platinum-selling Born This Way, will be competing for Best Song for “Born This Way,” Best Live Performer, Best Pop Performer, Best Female, Best Video (also for “Born This Way”) and the new category, Biggest Fans.
The retro Bruno Mars and the sweet-but-sticky Katy Perry are tied with four nominations each. Perry’s “Firework” is up for Best Song alongside Mars’ “Grenade.” Rounding out the competitors in the Best Song category are Adele with “Rolling in the Deep,” and Jennifer Lopez with her comeback hit “On the Floor.”
Besides the Biggest Fans category, the EMAs have added Best World Wide Act, which will celebrate artists from all over the world. Fans in Europe will vote for the European winner of World Wide who will then go on to compete for the title against internationally nominated superstars.
The full list of nominees can be found on here.

She’s known simply as “Dean Joan,” but her contributions to USC have been anything but simple.
Joan Metcalf Schaefer came to USC as Dean of Women Emerita in 1955, counseling and inspiring generations of students, and has not stopped.

For her 90th birthday Tuesday, Schaefer received boxes of letters, dozens of flower arrangements and countless phone calls from former and current students, proving her legacy at USC to be timeless.
“USC is very lucky to have had her all these years,” said Jerry Papazian, who graduated in 1977 with a bachelor of science in economics and now acts as Schaefer’s power of attorney. “She is what makes USC a special place. There are now two to three generations that have known Joan. She developed friendships with so many of those students and former students.”
Though Schaefer is 90 years old, she still makes the trip to her office in the Hancock building about once a week to see old friends, visit faculty members and inspire students.
“She loves students,” Papazian said. “What is keeping her going now is her ability to come to school.”
Coming to USC reminds Schaefer of why she does what she does.
“It’s been a lovely journey, really lovely,” Schaefer said. “I love teaching and I like counseling. You have to know what you’re doing and how to listen to the students.”
And listening is what Schaefer does best, said colleague Mona Cravens, director of Student Publications, who first got to know Schaefer in 1970 while working in the Student Affairs office.
“She has been extremely influential in my life, to be able to watch her work with students, and to try to hone in on my own listening skills,” Cravens said. “She taught me how important it is to really strive to help our students to believe in themselves. She helped me learn to listen well and really see the good in students.”
But it is more than her listening skills that mesmerize students and faculty alike; it is her charisma and ability to tell students exactly what they need to hear, said James Grant, a 1983 graduate who received the Order of Troy, awarded to students who demonstrate commitment to USC and the community, at Schaefer‘s request.
“She is this unique combination of charisma, fierce intelligence and I think there is a brutal honesty to her that is tempered in a very, very warm, loving person,” Grant said. “It is very rare for someone to be that brutally honest and so loving; it is a very unique trait. I think that is why she has been able to accomplish great things and impact so many people’s lives. That is why people love her. I know that is why I love her.”
Students are her life, according to Papazian. Her entire day would be filled with meetings and students would wait in line for hours to seek her advice.
“If students had a problem, they would tell their friends to go see Dean Joan,” Schaefer said. “So I always had so many students but I love them.”
While at USC, Schaefer’s favorite task was leading the International Summer School in Cambridge program. Every year, she would select 20 to 30 students to study abroad and experience Cambridge University in an interactive environment.
“If they were interesting and creative they would get along in a strange place when they went,” Schaefer said. “When we got over there I saw them all the time. So it was like a family.”
Schaefer is also on the executive board of Phi Beta Kappa, Mortar Board and has a scholarship named after her, the Dean Joan Metcalf Schaefer Scholarship, awarded to students who demonstrate leadership, scholarship and service.
Even after all these years, Schaefer has not left USC. Her legacy and the impact she made in individual students’ lives will carry on for generations to come, Grant said.
“I think about her as a beacon of life that will go on forever,” Grant said. “That is interesting because she is ageless. She is the same now as she was when she started.”

Entrepreneurship and innovation, the new faces of economic recovery in the United States, have long been a part of the Trojan Family.
President Barack Obama signed the America Invents Act on Friday, which will reduce wait time for patent applications by awarding patents to the “first to file” instead of the “first to invent” party.
“Here in America, our creativity has always set us apart, and in order to continue to grow our economy, we need to encourage that spirit wherever we find it,” Obama said in a speech after signing the bill.
To USC students, this “spirit” is nothing new.
Currently, 47 startups founded by USC students and faculty have an active status in the business world, according to the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation website.
Students received more than $150 million to form their companies from public and private sources in 2008 and 2009.
Thomas O’Malia, professor of clinical entrepreneurship and director emeritus of the Lloyd Greif Center, said the current innovation culture goes back to the 1960s when research took place in the basement of Bridge Hall.
“We are as a university staging constant opportunities to pitch [student] ideas and help [them] get money for [their] startups,” O’Malia said. “[Succeeding in entrepreneurship] is not a medical school thing where you pass a test … It’s the individual and the hard work.”
By the 1970s, the basement work had spawned a full-blown masters’ degree in entrepreneurship — the first in the country.
Ian Murphy, director of communications at the Stevens Institute, said a recent study at USC showed 57 percent of students expect to start a venture and 47 percent expect to start their own nonprofits.
Kathleen Allen, professor of clinical entrepreneurship and director of the Center for Technology Commercialization, also identified student initiative as a key element in the university’s reputation for growing startups.
“USC has a very high concentration of student entrepreneurs and students who think like entrepreneurs,” Allen said. “Our students believe that they can create their own opportunities. We’re fortunate that a lot of these students remain in Southern California to start businesses.”
Students, however, said faculty and administrative support is essential to invention.
Anna Sergeeva, a senior majoring in business administration, founded trueRSVP, an Evite-like website that keeps track of attendees’ “flakiness” records, with two other USC students last semester. They won the Alpha Pitch Award for college students at DEMO, an emerging technologies conference in Silicon Valley. Sergeeva said USC’s academic environment is particularly conducive to student innovation.
“A lot of the students are very driven — lots of individual schools at USC are at the top of their field,” Sergeeva said. “There’s a high caliber of people and obviously the faculty are very supportive.”
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 80 percent of Americans who want to start a business are between 18 and 34 years old — but startups in 2008, the Kauffman Index recorded, were overwhelmingly founded by older age groups. Those between 55 and 64 years old outnumbered the young cohort by almost 40 percent.
In USC’s case, though, the trend has historically been reversed. Allen said undergraduates have dominated startup activity until the last few years, when graduates began “catching up.”  A sluggish economy and disillusionment with previous jobs in industry prompted graduate students to start their own companies.
Tracy Lawrence, who graduated in 2011 with a degree in business administration, is  co-founder of catering and food truck-booking website Chewse.com. She said USC is not a creative place in the literal way.
“It’s not creative in that you’re artsy, but creative in that you create things, you create businesses,” Lawrence said. “I’ve been able to create something by reaching out to the people at USC, given the resources of USC. We don’t just lay foundations, we create things.”
Jon Vidar, who graduated in 2006 with a Master of Arts in communication management, also created his own company. In 2007, Vidar teamed up with two other recent graduates from the program to combine their abilities in writing and communication to launch their own nonprofit  in Rwanda.
“We wanted to help locals tell their tales,” Vidar said about their choice of venture. “We thought that in the age of YouTube, having an undocumented genocide was really unfair.”
Their startup, The Tiziano Project, survived on the founders’ out-of-pocket payments until 2009, when they won a Chase Community Grant worth $25,000. Since then, the nonprofit has won a steady stream of grants and is setting its sights on a Palestine-Israel sister project next year.
While mentoring and funding schemes are available via the Stevens Institute, Annenberg, the Lloyd Greif Center and other USC programs, an independent personality also characterizes university innovators, Murphy observed.
“Out here, people like to be mavericks,” Murphy said. “They like to do their own thing.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated the 47 startups were all started by USC students, when in fact they were started by both students and faculty.

Journalism students are often warned that newspaper journalism is a “dying profession,” corrupted by online and social media and doomed to lose its former credibility and integrity forevermore. 
But according to Judy Muller, an Emmy Award-winning television correspondent, National Public Radio commentator and professor at the Annenberg School for Communication, this is not the case. 
Last Tuesday, Muller wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times, “Where Newspapers Thrive,” about how daily newspapers are not only surviving but also thriving in small towns across America. 
In the article as well as in her book, Now This – Radio, Television, and the Real World, she discussed the differences between small-town journalism and national-level journalism, explaining that in small towns, most people have no choice but to read the daily papers because it is their only source for local news. 
Muller expressed her admiration for the courage of small-town journalists, explaining that unlike national news correspondents, small-town reporters have to live with the people they write about, which often means awkward occurrences, such as getting shunned at the supermarket or even losing friends. 
“Editors of small-town newspapers are quite brave and really inspirational,” Muller said. “Standing up to people is part of the job, and it’s not easy. They are practicing the first amendment with gusto.” 
But despite the courage and admirable qualities of small town journalists, it is not a glamorous job. “You won’t be rich,” added Muller. “You will make a living, and maybe even a very good living, but you aren’t going to strike it rich as a small-town journalist, which makes it a great place for journalism students to start.” 
By learning the fundamentals of honest reporting and having to deal with possible backlash from news subjects, small town journalism gives students a great foundation for one day delving into the world of national reporting, the path Professor Muller chose to take, and quite successfully so. 
But what does this all mean for the future of journalism, small-town or not? Does the proliferation of modern technology and online media foreshadow the demise of true, honest journalism? According to Muller, the answer is a resounding no. 
“I think we are in a golden age of journalism,” declared Muller. “Sure, it’s going to be painful. It is always painful watching people get fired, but I truly believe that the daily newspapers will emerge stronger than ever.” 
In Muller’s experienced eyes, assessing the current state of the media is all about perspective. “I think what is happening on the Internet is exciting for journalism,” Muller said. “In the modern media, there are so many opportunities for young journalists to get their voices out there, and I will always believe that the more voices that can be heard, the better.”

Students were split on a push from faculty and staff groups to ban smoking on campus at the “Smoke-Free Campus Forum” hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government in Taper Hall of Humanities on Wednesday night.
Smoking · USC Academic Senate Vice President Patricia Riley and Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Denzil Suite speak at the forum. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
The forum, attended by about 40 students, was intended to gauge student body support for the initiative before USG takes an official position by passing a senate resolution on the subject in the next few weeks. Students were urged to pose questions and voice their opinions in a town hall format to a four-person panel of university employees involved in the initiative.
“At this point, our stance is to discuss the issue more and gauge what students want to see before we, as representatives, can make any informed decision,” USG President Monish Tyagi said.
The panel was comprised of key university representatives involved with the initiative, including Patricia Riley, academic vice-president of the USC Academic Senate; Paula Swinford, director of Health Promotion and Prevention Services and John Gaspari, executive director of the Center for Work and Family Life.
Jared Ginsburg, USG director of campus affairs, began the forum by presenting the preliminary results from an ongoing online survey. Survey takers were able to support multiple options about limiting smoking on campus. Forty-five percent of the 1,227 respondents favored a categorical ban on smoking and 40 percent favored establishing designated smoking areas. Of the 1,227 survey respondents, 67 percent reported they never smoke. The survey will remain open for about two more weeks and can be accessed through USG’s website.
Most attendees favored a compromise, such as establishing designated smoking areas rather than a ban. Some students, however, were in favor of banning smoking altogether.
“If we take away the right to smoke it will lead to a healthier lifestyle and a better environment for everyone to be in,” said Niki Noe, a freshman majoring in biochemistry.
The administration has not yet made a decision on the issue, said panelist and Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Denzil Suite. He also said if the ban were to be put in place, there are no current plans to enforce it with citations or fines.
“Our approach would be more educational and informing people where they can and cannot smoke on campus,” Suite said.
The USG Senate will pass a resolution in which it will take an official position in support of or opposition to adopting a smoke-free campus policy once the survey has at least 2,000 responses, Ginsburg said.
“We have to wrestle between students who feel that it is their individual right to smoke on campus and in the open air and those who feel that it is an infringement on their right, in the sense that the air that they are breathing is being obstructed by second-hand smoke of passers by,” Ginsburg said.
After attending the event, some students said they felt less inclined to support a ban on smoking after hearing the side of student smokers.
“At first, going in, I was thinking they should ban smoking altogether,” said Yumeng Wei, a junior majoring in business administration. “But people brought up some really good points about it being their right to smoke and that they [are] already limited as to where they can smoke.”
The USC Academic Senate and the USC Staff Assembly, the respective representative bodies of faculty and staff, passed resolutions telling USC administration their constituents would support a smoke-free campus in 2010.
As of July 2011, at least 530 colleges have adopted 100 percent smoke-free campus policies, according to the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation. Current USC smoking policy dates back to 1993 and mostly pertains to smoking in buildings. Last October, the USC Health Sciences campus enacted a smoke-free policy. The Graduate and Professional Student Senate is also working on passing a resolution.

A letter from a doctor on shs
Robert E. Madden MD, FACS. I am also a non-smoker. HOWEVER I am a passionate opponent smoking bans. Most of the opposition to the smoking bans has been based upon economic factors such as loss of business revenue, even closings. My opposition is due to loss of individual freedom and abuse of scientific fact.
I am a practicing chest surgeon, a teacher and a former cancer researcher. I am also past president of the NY Cancer Society. I will not tell you that smoking is harmless and without risk, in fact one in eight hundred smokers will develop lung cancer. Asthmatics should avoid tobacco smoke. What I will say is: 1) it’s a personal choice and 2) so called second smoke (ETS) is virtually harmless. One may not like the smell but it has not been shown to cause cancer, even in bartenders. If people do not like the odor then they may go elsewhere. Those who support the ban have no right to deny 24% of the adult population their enjoyment of a popular product based on dislike, possibly hatred of smoking. This attitude is that of a bigot, akin to anti-Semitism or racism.
To me the most offensive element of the smoking bans is the resort to science as “proving that environmental smoke, second hand smoke, causes lung cancer”. Not only is this unproven but there is abundant and substantial evidence to the contrary. It is frustrating, even insulting, for a scientist like myself to hear the bloated statistics put out by the American Cancer Society (of which I am a member) and the American Lung Association used to justify what is best described as a political agenda. Smokers enjoy smoking. Most non-smokers are neutral. Anti-smokers hate smoking. It is this last group that drives the engine of smoking bans. Smoking sections in restaurants, ventilated bars and the like have been satisfactory and used for years. To those who choose to smoke they do so at their own risk. To those eschew smoking let them patronize establishments whose owners prohibit smoking. To impose a city wide or a state wide ban is to deny people of their rights.
Respectfully,
Robert E. Madden, M.D

Subject: THE TRUTH FROM A PHYSICIAN JOHN DALE DUNN..HEARTLAND
INSTITUTE
Date: Sat, 8 Nov 2008 01:04:54 -0500
I am a Texan for 22 years, a 36 year physician, specializing in
emergency medicine. I am familiar with the public health science on
second hand smoke. I can say with confidence that second hand smoke
may irritate some, but it does not kill. Those claiming thousands of
deaths from second hand smoke to the public are deceitful for a
political goal.
Public Health Studies cited by the Cancer Society and the Surgeon
General that claim thousands of deaths from second hand smoke are
weak, cherry-picked studies. Their supporters compound their perfidy
by ignoring studies by the World Health Organization (Buffetta 1998
in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute), Stranges, 2006 in
Archives of Internal Medicine and Enstrom 2003 in The British Medical
Journal, that show no second hand smoke effect.
In science, one study that disproves a scientific theory is more
important than a pile of studies that are slightly positive. Anti-
smoking advocates and fanatics ignore that basic rule and ignore any
study they don’t like. They are propagandists, not scientists.
The crusaders are willing to do anything and say anything about
second hand smoke, including making public statements about thousands
of deaths from second hand smoke. Those claims are multifarious and
duplicitous—they are lies. Second hand smoking, even for the spouse
of a smoker is one cigarette or less per day—which has no effect.
The second hand smoke scare is a phantom menace conjured up by the
High Holy Church of Smoke Haters to support the anti smoking
crusade…
Smoking Bans violate the Ohio tradition of mind your own business.
If the Ohio General Assembly thinks it has a role in telling people
how to live, they should get a Divinity Degree and find a
congregation. Folks in Ohio can easily avoid second hand smoke, and
employment in a bar or restaurant is voluntary. Smoking is legal.
Avoiding smoke is easy.

It is no fun being Netflix these days. Its plans for new headquarters at Los Gatos hit a major road block after a residents’ group, Los Gatos Citizens for Responsible Development, filed a lawsuit against the town for approving the company’s five- and four-story buildings despite a stipulated town height of three stories.
In addition, the company’s plans to split its business into separate DVD, called Qwikster, and internet streaming services, to be called Netflix, has led to discontentment amongst its subscribers. CEO Reed Hastings’ blog post announcing the decision witnessed several sharp comments as people didn’t seem too happy with the change. Most of them lambasted him for making life more difficult for about 12 million customers who get both streaming and DVD rentals. Those people will have to visit two websites to make requests and update their billing information.
In July and August, an increase in prices from the company led to several customers discontinuing their contracts. As a result, the company’s stock and brand values deteriorated sharply. From being one of the big guns at Wall Street, with a share price of $300 in early July, it has tumbled down sharply to $143 per share at close Sept. 19.
The declines were precipitated by Netflix’s warning that it expected to have 600,000 fewer subscribers at the end of September than at the end of June, by far the worst downturn in the company’s history.

With the upcoming release of the new action movie, Killer Elite, Robert De Niro is adding yet another film to his collection. With more than 80 movies under his belt, here are some of his notable films that highlight his talent and give evidence to his diversity in performance.   
Taxi Driver (1976)
You can’t talk about Robert De Niro without mentioning Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. This intense film takes you on a ride with Travis Bickle, a depressed and psychotic taxi driver that some consider an anti-hero by the film’s end. Ripe with violence, an eerie original score and a 13-year-old Jodie Foster portraying a prostitute, this film will never let you forget De Niro’s infamously improvised line, “You talkin’ to me?”  
Raging Bull (1980) 
De Niro portrays real life boxer from the ‘40s, Jake LaMotta, in this Martin Scorsese film. Filmed almost entirely in black and white, it follows LaMotta’s battles both in the ring and in his relationships, where he exhibits unsettling violence and out of control jealousy. De Niro prepared for the role by learning how to box, and even competed in a few matches. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for this role.  
Awakenings(1990) 
Showing he’s not just a tough guy with an attitude, De Niro plays Leonard Lowe, a man in 1969 who “awakens” from a catatonic state thanks to the then-new drug, L-Dopa. He learns to adjust to his life after being out of commission for decades. Starring alongside Robin Williams, this film shows just how good De Niro is at becoming even the most humble of characters. Have tissues on hand for this one, as it will be unexpectedly tear-jerking.  
Cape Fear (1991)
In this psychological thriller directed by Martin Scorsese (noticing a trend?), De Niro torments Nick Nolte and preys on a young Juliette Lewis as vengeful ex-convict, Max Cady. Certainly one of his more disturbing roles, check this movie out if you like suspense and an antagonist that just won’t give up right to the very end. Playing Max Cady earned De Niro nominations for Best Actor for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.  
Meet the Parents series (2000)
And last, but not least, our star of the moment dabbles with comedy in this series that includes Meet the Fockers (2004) and Little Fockers (2010). Though not De Niro’s first comedic role, playing Jack Byrnes — ex-CIA agent turned cat-loving, doting father — is one of his more memorable characters of funny charm. His tough demeanor serves for laughter this time around, and we can never really grow tired of seeing Ben Stiller squirm. 
Honorable mentions go out to Mean Streets (1973), The Deer Hunter (1978), Goodfellas(1990) and This Boy’s Life (1993).

A trial processor debuted this week from Intel researchers that performs with notably lower energy consumption. Demonstrated at Intel’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, the processor took the first steps toward low-powered microchips of the future.
The experimental low-processor was demonstrated on a PC that ran off a solar powered microchip. The chip — codenamed “Claremont” — is recognized as a near-threshold voltage operator that improves efficiency while reducing energy waste. 
The chip itself was the only solar-powered part of Intel’s demonstration, in which the computer itself ran off of normal electricity. The processor debuted simultaneously with Intel’s hybrid memory cube, a trial project that is an energy-efficient memory interface.
After several years of research, Intel was able to achieve a processor that stays on in an “ultra-low power state” instead of shutting off. Though five times more efficient than current processors, Intel’s chief technology officer Just Rattner stated the device was not ready for commercial use. Intel is still working to balance impressive energy efficiency with product performance. 
“Claremont” is a redesign of a decade old Pentium processor that used a must simpler design than contemporary chips. This allowed Intel to manageably redesign uncomplicated circuits at much lower power sources. According to The Huffington Post, the Pentium processor’s technology is so dated that the small team of researchers of Intel had to search through eBay to find a motherboard to plug the chip into. 
Intel promises more solar-powered research for the future, in which one day it will power small sensors into complicated computer technology that will tackle bigger challenges.

On my third or fourth listen of Irish singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan’s sophomore album, Passenger, which dropped Tuesday, a simple thought kept recurring: “When are people going to stand up and notice?” 
For Hannigan (perhaps best known as Damien Rice’s former backing vocalist) is certainly talented; but her unique brand of folk-rock is oddly unclassifiable. There are no flashy pyrotechnics in her live act (unless you want to count her practically thrashing a string dulcimer to death when she covers Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus”); just the simple sounds of guitar, bass and drums — occasionally augmented with a mandolin, banjo and other acoustic instruments.
Passenger however, does represent a sonic and lyrical leap forward. Where her first album, Sea Sew (2009), suggested the warmth of home and romance through its inviting lyrics and use of harmonium and brass, Passenger is the natural flipside. Hannigan’s lilting voice suggests something a great deal more somber (the harmonium is replaced here by violin and cello, and often electric backing), or at least, wistful nostalgia. 
That isn’t to say it’s all terribly serious. “Knots” is a terrifically fun “What Happened Last Night?” odyssey, and my personal favorite, “What’ll I Do”, takes her wonderful powers of observation and turns them into a song of crisis over a lover’s absence. I can only hope that this album (which features a duet with the great Ray LaMontagne) will put her over the top.
 Passenger is out now. Lisa Hannigan will be performing next Tuesday September 27th at The El Rey Theatre.

After nearly a year of appeals for the two American hikers still held in custody after their arrest in July 2009, interfaith was the key to bringing Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal home.
Thanks in part to efforts from an American delegation of religious leaders from Washington and the prominent Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the government in Tehran finally agreed to release the two men.
Accused of espionage for the United States, the two men, along with a third female hiker, were taken into custody for crossing the Iran-Iraq border two years ago. The three state they accidentally crossed into Iran while hiking in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
Sarah Shourd, the third member of the party, was released last year on humanitarian grounds.
However, the government based in Tehran clearly disagreed with the “lost hiker” alibi for the two males, sentencing them to three years for illegal entry into Iran and five additional years for spying.
Fortunately, the conservative Muslim government was prevailed upon to reconsider the decision to imprison Bauer and Fattal starting with a personal letter campaign addressed to Ahmedinejad last September. With the support of famous figures such as Muhammad Ali supporting the cause, prominent Muslim American and interfaith leaders have contributed to the publicity of this ambiguous case.
Furthermore, prominent Christian leaders aided the cause to prove that the religions can work together peacefully for the sake of human rights. While the hikers have lost two years of their lives in this tumultuous rights case, the compliance of Iranian religious leaders has led to a collective sigh of relief for all those involved in the delicate political issue.
Finally, the hikers are coming home.

ink.
Opened Wednesday night, ink. is Top Chef Michael Voltaggio’s latest culinary experience.  Voltaggio, season six winner of Bravo’s hit show Top Chef, has been making a name for himself with his innovative and chic restaurants.
Voltaggio’s kitchen blends classic ingredients with modern twists and fusions.  The menu is full of creative gastronomic options, such as iberico de bellota pork loin with romesco beans and octopus with popcorn and piquillo peppers.
Vegetarians and vegans also have options with green dishes, such as the mashed potatoes and seaweed and the carrots with nasturtium, yogurt, vadouvan and an edible-spiced soil.
Reservations for ink. are taken online, at its website: mvink.com, up to 30 days in advance.  Located on Melrose Avenue, ink. is open Wednesday through Sunday for dinner, and Voltaggio accepts walk-ins at the bar.
Be sure to check out this unique culinary creation — and who knows, maybe you’ll even see Voltaggio.
Dasariski Business
Dasariski will be performing a long-form, comedy improv routine Friday at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre.
Dasariski, composed of Robert Dassie, Craig Cackowski and Rich Talarico, takes one suggestion from the audience, and instead of doing Whose Line Is It Anyway style comedy, creates a half-hour to hour long piece of theater.  Viewers will appreciate Dasariski for its different approach to comedic performance, avoiding absurd situations and jokes and slapstick, by focusing on real characters and believable relationships.
Though Dasariski’s approach strays from those of normal improv groups, the group’s unique style pays off with long-form genius and entertainment for everybody to enjoy.
To check out Dasariski at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, make a reservation at losangeles.ucbtheatre.com.  Tickets cost $5 and will go fast, as these seasoned veterans promise a hilarious show.
Folk Art Bike Ride
Craft and Folk Art Museum is sponsoring a unique and cultural look at the landscape of Los Angeles that will premiere Sunday.
As part of the Folk Art Everywhere special urban events series, “Folk Art Bike Ride: In and Around Downtown” will take participants on a ride through the various neighborhoods of Los Angeles, sticking closely to the Metro Gold Line route.
Creative public spaces and special guest speakers scheduled to give detailed descriptions about the local art and urban histories will highlight the event.
The ride will start at Mariachi Plaza, at the Northeast corner of East First Street and South Boyle Avenue, and end near Wurstküche, Los Angeles’ famous purveyor of exotically grilled sausages.  The ride doesn’t cost anything, and is sure to be a didactic and intriguing day on the town.
If you want to take a bite out of Los Angeles culture, send an RSVP request to rsvp@cafam.org.
Arctic Monkeys & TV on the Radio
The Hollywood Bowl season is coming to a close Sunday, but to top off a fantastic season, the Bowl is hosting a quintuple musical extravaganza of unique hot shots and up and comers, all of whom have been circulating the indie scene for quite some time now.
Eccentric opener Panda Bear, also known as Noah Lennox from Animal Collective, folk breakout War Paint and the exciting Smith Westerns, who recently performed at FYF Fest, are bound to kick things off to an interesting start with their experimental beats and enticing, musically provoking sounds.
The rising TV on the Radio will finish off with co-headliners, the energetic Arctic Monkeys, most commonly known for their smash hit “I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor” — the result should be heaven in indie form.
Come to the Bowl at 6 p.m., bring a picnic in tow to enjoy under the stars, catch this sensational line up and brace yourself for an exquisitely eclectic night of music.

Blake Mycoskie’s autobiography, Start Something That Matters, tries to give readers an inside look into what it takes to be a successful social entrepreneur but falls short in giving practical advice that will actually help.
Quirky entrepreneur · Blake Mycoskie’s autobiography falls short of giving meaningful advice, but will prove a good read for those interested in Mycoskie’s personal story and rapid rise to success. - Photo courtesy of The TOMS Team
Mycoskie’s ambiguous and oversimplified eight-step guide to social entrepreneurial success is so saturated with shameless plugs and unnecessary details that it is easy to miss Mycoskie’s point that passion is really all that matters.
Granted, Mycoskie did start TOMS Shoes — a relatively new shoe company that hit the hipster scene long enough to become a world-class brand — and at first glance he does have the qualifications to school the American public on entrepreneurship.
But read Start Something That Matters further and his advice turns into suggestions such as filling the company wall with inspirational quotes or getting “SUPER FANTASTIC” interns.
According to Mycoskie, the eight steps to becoming a successful social entrepreneur are achieved by finding your story, facing your fears, being resourceful, keeping it simple, building trust, giving and starting something that matters.
If this is all Mycoskie did to get where he is today, he should enter the lottery, because sheer luck is on his side.
Instead of concrete examples of how to pitch a good idea or practical guidelines for presentations in front of industry professionals, Mycoskie spends his time giving readers generic one-liners about “knowing your audience” and “treating customers as you would like to be treated.”
Mycoskie is not malicious; he actually believes his purpose is to inspire others into successful social entrepreneurship.
What Mycoskie does well is introduce the concept of passion and inspire those who are on the fence to go for it and start a company they may not have had the courage to start.
But if someone reads his book and decides to become a social entrepreneur, then he or she should look elsewhere for the “how to run a business” manual, because Mycoskie is probably not the best place to start.
His anecdotes about Steve Jobs starting Apple in his garage and Google succeeding because of its lack of initial funding (rather than in spite of it) all contribute to Mycoskie’s notion that anyone can be a winner. Whether or not that is true seems superfluous, since Mycoskie writes in such a way that makes it hard to disagree with him.
Mycoskie is quirky, and his writing reflects that. His company title is “Chief Shoe Giver” and his assistant is known as the “Straight Shoeter.” With jokes interspersed with cheesy graphics and inspirational stories, Mycoskie sets the reader up for a good laugh and plenty of encouraging moments.
It is heartening to know someone as goofy, idealistic and simple as Mycoskie can make it big in such a competitive market as the shoe industry.
He explains that people would laugh at him after hearing his pitch or after finding out he ran his company from the comfort of his bedroom. Mycoskie even photocopied his journal from when he first thought of the idea, revealing his original plan for success included getting interns and getting donors.
His writing is simple and his ideas are basic — the problem is, the real world is not. Starting a business takes more than just having an idea. Mycoskie unfortunately does not address this reality.
But for those who are not looking to start a company or simply need some light-hearted motivation, Start Something That Matters might be inspiring.

As with any other artistic medium, from movies to music, the art lover is bound to be attracted to one particular genre more than others.
Each period of art history brings a new aesthetic, a new message and new inspiration to artists either reacting to their social environments or trying to create a new world. 
The late 1950s brought an art style that challenged the tenets of more traditional, classical artforms. With its brightly-colored, celebrity, iconic product-adorned canvases, this new style straddled a fine line between glorifying and criticizing popular culture.
This new movement, referred to as “Pop Art,” stands as one of the most controversial, lasting types of art and, despite the beliefs of some critics, one of the most engaging and complex.
One of the biggest figures in the Pop Art world, Richard Hamilton, passed away last week at the age of 89.
His most famous piece, 1956’s  “Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing?” is a skillfully-constructed collage that took magazine images and placed them in the home. Fast-fowarding to Jeff Koon’s current exhibition at LACMA, it is obvious Hamilton’s piece has served as inspiration for a movement that is ever-flexible and ever-intriguing.
Pop Art does not touch upon the usual subjects of art such as personal emotions, but instead features a humor toward society’s fixation on icons and the things that surround us.
Hamilton’s legacy leaves inspiration for new artists to take in these surroundings and address them through art, instead of letting art simply exist as a completely different realm detached from the real world. From Andy Warhol’s classic silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe to Jeff Koons’ piece “Michael Jackson and Bubbles,” Pop artists bring the popular and recognizable into galleries and museums that would normally pride themselves on high-brow artistic achievement.
Naturally, the humor and heavy presence of popular culture in Pop Art has garnered disapproval from some art lovers.
A classic example of the clash of Pop and classic art took place in France in 2008 when traditional art enthusiasts, angered over Jeff Koons’ works being placed in the Chateau de Versailles protested. The lavish walls of the Paris palace featured works such as a giant, bright-pink steel statue of a balloon dog.
To these infuriated art fans, the rooms associated with royalty and classical beauty had become hosts for simplistic works that lacked gravitas.
Yet what they didn’t realize is that what makes Pop Art seem so simple is the same thing that makes it so complex. Yes, you can just stare at the giant steel balloon dog and deem it merely “cute,” but you can also try to deduce a more sophisticated meaning from it.
Koon’s “Quad Elvis,” an image of four semi-naked women with an inflatable lobsters superimposed on them, might seem purely comical, but it could also be taken as criticism. The piece could be trying to reflect on how we present the body of women, almost in the same way as we would an inflatable toy.
Similarly, Roy Lichtenstein’s pieces took familiar images from comic books and tweaked the dialogue to expose the ridiculous attitudes of the characters and the storylines from popular stories like soap operas. And there will probably always be a debate on whether or not Andy Warhol’s pieces are simply echoing the nature of popular culture or criticizing its basic tenets.
Pop Art requires the audience to engage and create its own opinion. Hamilton’s “Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing?” might have its argument in its title, but viewers who see the piece as a projection of their own homes might not sense any underlying, analytical message.
Pop Art reminds us of the images we are surrounded by and gives us the choice to either step into the museum and continue passively taking it in or stop and think more closely about what we see.
From Japanese artist Takashi Murakami’s current exhibition at Versailles to less obvious inspiration in popular culture, like Lady Gaga’s silly Kermit the Frog costume, Pop Art is still very much alive.
Hamilton started artists off on the idea that the products, the celebrities and the images of popular culture are a bigger part of our lives than we realize. As is obvious so many decades after his first works, Hamilton has left behind a lasting legacy.

It’s an awkward sensation listening to Demi Lovato’s third album, Unbroken, knowing that eight months ago she was released from rehabilitation after being treated for various traumas — bipolar disorder, anorexia and self-mutilation.
Though it is inevitable that some people will see her album and immediately write it off, Lovato has more in common with us than most would like to admit.
USC paints a pretty picture of college youth: bubbly sorority girls and fit frat guys wasting away in the California sunshine. But it’s nothing new that a lot of personal issues boil up when students go away to school. Problems with alcohol, eating disorders and emotional traumas run rampant in our generation. Most would like to ignore these issues, but when they are addressed, emotions explode.
Unbroken has a lot to say about these coming-of-age issues.
Demi Lovato struggles through the opening tracks on Unbroken. She faces the challenge of catering to her Disney fans while owning up to her adult issues. So she does both, to little success, pulling influence from artists like Keri Hilson and Rihanna.
Unbroken fires off with the Timbaland-produced “All Night Long,” which surprisingly features rap legend Missy Elliot. With a bumping beat backing lyrics such as I want you in / I want you bad / let’s keep the party going all night long, red flags go up immediately. Lovato is never going back to the sound that made her famous. If her past two albums were childish, welcome to college Demi.
The starlet continues on with the set’s second single, “Who’s That Boy,” featuring electro-pop sensation Dev. The saccharine R&B production on “Boy” is dance-floor ready, and Dev’s contribution adds a grungy club flare to an already-sweet beat.
Lovato rounds out the “club-edit” section of Unbroken with the mindlessly obnoxious “You’re My Only Shorty” featuring Iyaz and “Together,” a mid-tempo ballad featuring Jason Derulo.
These vacuous but catchy dance-pop/R&B hybrids explore sexual discovery and identification, but that’s not what people have been waiting to hear about from Disney’s fallen angel. When the introspective tunes surface, Lovato begins to investigate and confront the personal demons that consumed the majority of her teenage years.
“Lightweight,” “Unbroken,” and “Fix A Heart” are the emotive trifecta of Unbroken. “Lightweight” can be moving when Lovato confesses, Light on my heart / Light on my feet / Light in your eyes /  I can’t even speak to angelically pulsing synths. The vulnerable vocals portray a girl who, so easily lost in the attention brought about by young love, becomes an affection-needy parasite.
“Unbroken” offers the trippiest production on the album. Lovato’s robotic disharmonies stun and her caustic vocals attack those who thought her stint in rehab was the end of her career. “Fix A Heart” contributes sweeping strings, booming basses and apocalyptic vocals. Easily one of the strongest tracks on the album, Lovato admits her past struggles will always carry a weight on her shoulders — that You can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart.
This is more like it.
Unbroken’s lead single “Skyscraper” is the apex of the record. Lovato could have an award-contending work on her hands. With the breathy vocals, the subtle, emotive cracks in her voice, the tempestuous poetry (Would it make you feel better / to watch me while I bleed?), Lovato has crafted a moving pop opus. The words of inspiration are daunting, but Lovato artistically pulls off this larger-than-life song with ease.
Closing the album with “For The Love Of A Daughter,” Lovato unleashes painfully sincere emotions backed with disconcerting lyricism. Recounting emotional and physical abuse from her father, the singer pains to figure out why she still can’t let him go.
Unbroken has been highly anticipated because of Lovato’s publicized struggles. Critics were wondering if she could get back on her feet. More importantly, fans who have been facing similar emotional and physical issues have been finding solace in her universally appealing recovery story.
For all those looking for heavy advice from a girl the age of most college freshmen: Lovato is our age and does what we do — party, burn bridges, fall in love and fall victim to the pressures of life. If anyone can speak our language, it’s our peer.
Lovato often hits the mark on Unbroken. She can be powerful, moving and healing.

Junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s on-the-field achievements are well recognized: The third-year starter and Heisman Trophy candidate’s play through three games this season have football analysts projecting him to be a top five pick in next year’s NFL draft. Now, the team captain is being recognized for his contributions off the field.
Role model · Though widely recognized for his on-field play, junior quarterback Matt Barkley sets an example for the community off the field. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Barkley was named a member of the 2011 Allstate American Football Coaches Association Good Works Team, which honors players who make outstanding contributions to their communities.
“Allstate is proud to partner with the AFCA to present and grow awareness around this award and continues to be inspired by the commitment and dedication of its recipients,” said Allstate Executive Vice President Mark LaNeve. “For two decades this award has represented one of the great aspects of college football by shining a spotlight on the community involvement of its student-athletes.”
One of Barkley’s notable contributions came during an 11-day trip to Nigeria in December 2010 to visit widows, orphans, villagers and prisoners.
He performed construction work, distributed supplies and shared stories stories with the local people.
Barkley also traveled to an orphanage in South Africa in 2008 and has helped build homes for the poor in Mexico.
He has been an active member of his church and has played guitar in the church choir.
In high school, he helped found the Monarchs for Marines program to raise money for soldiers’ families.
Fans will determine the winner of the award by voting on ESPN.com and searching “Good Works.” They will choose from one of the 11 candidates from schools across the country.
Proud to be a Trojan when we have such great young people such as Matt doing all that he does.

So far it’s been a familiar setting for USC: “Tribute to Troy” blaring over the loudspeakers, the fourth-quarter torch lighting and Traveler prancing down the Coliseum sidelines.
That changes Saturday, however, when the Trojans head to Tempe, Ariz., to take on Arizona State in their first road game of the season.
It’s often hard to truly gauge any team until it plays in unfriendly confines, and USC is going to face a difficult challenge Saturday in trying to duplicate its success away from the Coliseum.
But if the team can figure out quickly how to play on the road, it’s going to make things very interesting down the line for games against Notre Dame and, more interestingly, Oregon.
Last year, USC was not a particularly bad team on the road. Just two of its five losses came when donning white uniforms, including one at Oregon State, the Trojans’ infamous deathtrap. The other loss? That came against then-No. 16 Stanford, a team that ended up obliterating Virginia Tech to win the Orange Bowl. And let’s not forget the Trojans lost by only two points on a last-second field goal shrouded in controversy about improper timekeeping.
On the ground and in the air, USC’s offense was markedly better on the road last season. The team threw for 243 yards per game and 2.4 touchdowns away last season, compared to just 240 yards and 1.8 touchdowns at home. Similarly, the Trojans rushed for 207 yards per game and 1.6 touchdowns on the road last year, compared to only 168 yards and 1.5 touchdowns at home.
The defensive home-away splits were about equal, but last season’s defense was atypically dreadful altogether.
Really, though, the catch about playing on the road is the degree of unpredictability that comes along with those games. No one predicted the Beavers’ 36-7 slaughtering last season, where junior quarterback Matt Barkley suffered an injury to his left ankle, and it shouldn’t have happened.
But things that shouldn’t happen often do on the road, and as a result, USC will need to be prepared for anything.
Arizona State should prove a worthy test in the first road game of the season, as the Sun Devil Stadium crowd appeared to play a role in the team’s week two win over then-No. 21 Missouri in overtime. The Tigers amassed 11 penalties for 110 yards, showing a lack of discipline often associated with playing under pressure in front of a hostile crowd.
At times, Barkley has struggled managing to get snaps off before the play clock expires, taking delay-of-game penalties and sometimes using timeouts at inopportune times. And that’s when the student section is quieting the crowd down to make things easy for him.
Sun Devil Stadium won’t be so accommodating, and USC will likely suffer a handful of delay-of-games and false-start penalties, particularly for a young offensive line.
USC has a handful of freshmen starters who have yet to experience an opposing crowd at the college level. Wide receiver Marquis Lee, tight end Xavier Grimble, guard Marcus Martin and linebacker Dion Bailey will have to learn on the fly how to deal with the lack of support.
Significantly more important than the team’s reaction to the surroundings, however, is the reaction of Andre Heidari, the freshman kicker who has attempted just three field goals so far this season and made two.
Consistent with the Trojans’ performance to this point in the season, the game’s probably not going to be a blowout. In fact, there’s a good chance it’s going to be close.
As USC knows better than almost any other team over the last two seasons, a field goal at the end of the fourth quarter is a remarkably critical play, loaded with pressure.
It can be hard for a kicker to face the deafening roar of a crowd expending all its energy to make sure that ball spins wide when there’s no room for a mistake. It’s tough for any kicker, to be sure — overwhelming, probably, for a freshman.
On top of all that, there’s a sharp coach on the opposite sideline, Dennis Erickson, who will surely use his timeouts to ice Heidari — more likely to make him sweat more than anything else.
Success or failure in a moment like that can be determined instantly for a player, at least in the eyes of fans, and Heidari has a real opportunity to endear himself to an entire fan base.
After all, it’s about time USC was on the winning end of a one- or two-point victory sealed by a clutch field goal.
But who can really predict what will happen on the road?

Despite only three collegiate games under his belt, freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee has already begun turning heads with his big-play ability.
“He’s gotten better every week,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Last week, in the game, he looked the best that he’s looked as far as being comfortable, being lined up.”
Serra standout · Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee has drawn comparisons to teammate Robert Woods during his first year at USC. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Kiffin’s highest praise came when comparing sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods’ freshman season to Lee’s performance.
“I would say at this point right now, after three games, he’s ahead of where [Woods] was a year ago,” Kiffin said. “This kid’s really special. He’s every bit as fast as Robert, but he’s bigger and stronger.”
Lee, who is the No. 2 receiver behind Woods, is locked in to play when the coaches decide to call his number.
“[I’ve] come out here focused way more than I was the previous weeks,” Lee said. “You know, got everything off my mind and just really focused on the game and I’m ready.”
Saturday’s matchup against Arizona State in No. 23 USC’s first road Pac-12 game features a banged up, yet effective secondary that Lee and Woods will try to exploit.
“I wasn’t here last year to play them, but I heard their top corner is hurt. So I mean, they’re still doing a great job,” Lee said. “I know they got an amazing team, and I know about their linebackers being great, too. We’ll just go out there and compete and give [them] a good look.”
Lee might be asked to go across the middle of the field where Arizona State junior linebacker Vontaze Burfict awaits — Burfict is widely considered one of the top linebackers in the country. But the prospect of being hit by Burfict does not faze Lee.
“I think if he gets a shot on me, he gets a shot on me,” Lee said. “I’ll make sure I’ll catch the ball. I won’t get hit for nothing.”
—
When asked about the announcement late Tuesday night that the Pac-12 will not seek to add more teams for next season, Kiffin agreed with the decision.
“I think it’s great,” Kiffin said. “I love where we’re at right now and we’re just getting used to this format, championship game format, North and South [divisions] and so on.”
The addition of Oklahoma and Texas would not have threatened the Trojans’ recruiting advantage in Southern California, Kiffin noted.
“They’ve always tried to come in here. I don’t think that would change very much,” Kiffin said. “Just because you play a game one time a year in Los Angeles on a rotating schedule, I don’t think  that really helps that much. You’ve still got to go a long ways away. I don’t think that would have been a big deal.”
—
Freshman wide receiver George Farmer played with the offensive starters during Wednesday’s practice, but Kiffin’s decision concerning Farmer’s status for this season is clear.
“We’re planning on redshirting George; he’s looked better than he ever has been,” Kiffin said. “If this were the beginning of the year right now, he’d be in the mix because he’s finally healthy. So we’re excited about him playing down the road.”
Though Farmer is likely to redshirt this season, another freshman, tailback Amir Carlisle, could factor into the Trojans’ gameplan against Arizona State despite not logging any playing time in the first three games of the season
“We think that he can help us,” Kiffin said of Carlisle. “He adds another dimension and some juice.”
Carlisle has been presumed to redshirt.
—
Redshirt freshman Kyle Prater made the play of practice, as he made a diving one-handed catch along the sideline.
“He’s very capable of huge plays; he’s just got to get more consistent,” Kiffin said. “Every time he starts to make a stride, something happens. He’s going to eventually be a really good player, hopefully it’s soon.”
Senior offensive tackle Martin Coleman and junior wide receiver Brice Butler and junior center Abe Markowitz were among those who did not practice.

It’s a sobering statistic, and not one USC women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin wants to hear: The Women of Troy are 3-6 overall.
They opened the season by getting swept off their home field for the second straight year. They are 0-4 at McAlister Field for the first time in the program’s 17-year history. And for the first time in their history, they enter conference play Sunday against Washington State with a losing record.
Scoring struggles · Senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval, who led the Women of Troy in goals last season with six, has failed to put the ball in the back of the net on 12 shot attempts this year. As a unit, USC has just 13 goals through nine games. - Mac Carlile | Daily Trojan
“It’s been disappointing,” junior defender Kristina Noriega said. “We’re looking forward to starting over in conference.”
Khosroshahin echoed similar sentiments.
“It’s been disappointing,” Khosroshahin said. “We’ve been giving away too many cheap goals and not putting away our opportunities to finish.”
It’s hard to pinpoint a particular reason for this team’s struggles. The Women of Troy’s shot total (114) is nearly identical to their opponents’ (113). They knocked off then-No. 17 Illinois in Champaign, Ill., with an impressive 3-1 victory. They hung with and at times even outplayed then-No. 4 Oklahoma State for 90 minutes, but nonetheless, lost 1-0.
“We’ve shown moments that we can play with anyone in the country,” Khosroshahin said. “There have only been two games where we’ve lost the stats. But that doesn’t matter when you don’t win the most important stat.”
But even Khosroshahin will tell you a team can only be so unlucky. He knows that ultimately, his team controls its destiny, insisting when it plays to its ability level it can play with anyone in the country. Yet USC hasn’t thus far, and now he is demanding improvement on both sides of the ball.
“There are moments in every game where you go, ‘Wow this team is really good,’” Khosroshahin said. “And there are moments where you go, ‘Wow what just happened?’ And we need to eliminate those moments. We have to figure out how to find our discipline.”
Of the 16 goals the Women of Troy have conceded this year, seven have come from fluid offensive play. On the other hand, several box score descriptions read as follows: “free kick tips off goalie,” “header over goalie,” “long ball through defense,” “rebound off cross bar,” “free kick deflects off defender,” “back heel tap” and “keeper challenge, open net.” None sounds particularly impressive.
Many of the goals the Women of Troy have allowed have occurred during mad scrambles in front of the goal where the ball happens to find its way into the net.
“We’ve conceded goals from lack of discipline,” Khosroshahin said. “We need to stick to our defensive responsibilities. If one person doesn’t do one thing, it causes a breakdown, someone has to cover for that and it turns into a domino effect.”
The defensive backline is a young unit, still reeling from the graduation last year of captain Karter Haug, a four-year starter in the back and an anchor for the unit. And with sophomore Mia Bruno out for the season with an ACL injury and senior Chelsea Buehning slow to recover from an ACL injury of her own, Khosroshahin has been forced to mix and match on the backline.
Noriega, a transfer, has been asked to start every game at center back, playing every minute of the season but seven. Senior midfielder Ashli Sandoval has spent most of her minutes next to Noriega. On the defensive wing, sophomore Autumn Altamirano, who spent most of her time last year at forward, has started every game and played in all but 19 of the 830 minutes the Women of Troy have played this year. Across from her is true freshman Jessica Musmanno, also recruited as a forward.
“I want to have consistency back there,” Khosroshahin said. “But we haven’t found the right mix yet.”
The forward spots face a similar issue.
Like Haug on defense, the Women of Troy lost a pair of four-year starters last year in Megan Ohai and Alyssa Dávila. Sophomore Elizabeth Eddy has filled part of the void with a pair of goals, but Khosroshahin is still searching for a true playmaker. Senior Ashley Freyer, junior Samantha Johnson and senior Claire Schloemer have seen time up front. Altamirano finished second on the team in goals last year, but she’s needed back on defense this year.
“Right now I really couldn’t tell you who our forwards are,” Khosroshahin said. “The players who have been in the past really aren’t performing the roles we need them to.”
This week at practice, Khosroshahin said he started over. Open tryouts at every position on the field were held.
“I’m always evaluating,” Khosroshahin said. “But this week I’ve really put it out there. Open competition. We need to find the best 11 to put on the field.”
Sobering statistics and sobering words from the coach.  SC students be in the stands this weekend to support our classmates who are members of team.  It’s a bitch that they are struggling but we still need to support them just like we do our football team.
Wow. Desperation time now that he is having to schedule open tryouts at every position so late in the season. Altamirano is much more effective as a forward. She played that position throughout her club career. Can’t believe they are so short on defenders.
@Alum like I said before  the team has about 30 girls.  Open tryouts?  altamiran isn’t doing bad on d. I admit I like her better on offense.  If not her on d then who?  Moving her now could spell disaster. Same with Sandovol.  The troubling part of what the coach said is the fact that the team doesn’t have a playmaker and scorer out of all of the midfielders on the field and roster. WTF that’s just bs but I have seen why.  I’ve gone to every home game and the 3 players I would designate as the offensive players are always on the ground, play without purpose and direction or play dirty/physical over taking care of the ball or possessing.

Raise boys and girls the same. Protect me from what I want. Abuse of power comes as no surprise.
Imagine these phrases placed on T-shirts and posters. Imagine them winding in LED letters around the curves of the Guggenheim museum in New York. Imagine them in huge letters, projected and sliding over the pyramid outside the Louvre museum in Paris.
These are the pieces artist Jenny Holzer has created over the last three decades of her career. And Tuesday night, this prolific and legendary artist spoke to a cozy group under a tent on the lawn of the Fisher Museum of Art.
“Off with the lights, on with the show,” were the words Holzer uttered as the lights dimmed and she walked the audience through a slide show of her impressive work. As she revealed the inspiration behind her works, she also revealed the humility, humor and passion that make her a significant artist
Holzer revealed she didn’t feel her painting skills were up to par, which led to the idea of working with text as art.
“I turned to language and the adventure began,” said Holzer.
Though many of her later works were officially commissioned or done with permission from museums, buildings and advertising spaces, her journey started out as that of most street artists. In fact, she worked closely with graffiti and street artists throughout her years as an artist.
When she crafted T-shirts, one proud wearer included Lady Pink, one of the few famous female graffiti artists. Holzer also teamed up with Keith Haring, another big graffiti art figure, known for his unique, caricature-like figures. Holzer has also worked with important art figures such as Barbara Kruger and Claes Oldenburg.
But the way she uses text to reach out to her audience is all her own. Her early works are made up of things she wrote herself until she started collaborating with poets such as Henri Cole.
“I never could write the way I wanted to but while I did, it let me get the subject matter present, if not ideal,” Holzer said. “[With the poets’ work] I could present a greater range of subject matter, not to mention emotions, than one person could muster.”
In fact, emotion is a big part of Holzer’s works. Her statements challenge the passerby to reassess things about society, whether it be issues about gender or war. Holzer has used her art to reach as many people as possible, carefully choosing the locations in which to put her works.
“I like places in the postcard setting. I like my art to work for people walking by not intending to see art,” Holzer said.
From her giant projections to her LED creations, Holzer makes her chosen text come alive and pays close attention to the way in which each medium will present the text.
“One wonderful thing about electronics is that they have big brains,” Holzer said. “Even people who are stuck [at the same location] every day won’t see the same thing. The projections don’t have any of the associations of the electronics. They’re about soft, white light and reading together.”
Despite her works being displayed all around the world, you don’t have to travel far to see Holzer’s work. Right outside the Fisher Museum is her piece “Blacklist,” a series of text on granite benches and steps.
The piece is a memorial to the Hollywood Ten and the time in which people involved in the entertainment industry were blacklisted for expressing certain beliefs. Holzer researched the subject and also spoke to people who were blacklisted and their families.
The piece took a while to be undertaken and was not universally accepted because it seemed so leftist. Yet Holzer made sure to include both sides of the issue.
“I didn’t think the memorial would make sense if the opposition or the people on the fence weren’t included,” Holzer said. “It would be like pushing against air.”
Holzer has now moved on to painting and no longer creates works that include her own writing. Upon being asked if she would ever return to writing, Holzer responded with her trademark humor.
“I try to be funny in e-mails but that’s about it.”

In February 2010, 11 University of California, Irvine students from the Muslim Student Union disrupted a speech given by Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, to students and members of the community at UC Irvine.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The 11 students were arrested on the spot, and the Muslim Student Union, which was proven to have carefully crafted the fiasco, was later placed on a quarter-long suspension and two-year probation by university administration.
The students now face misdemeanor charges in court.
Some have claimed the punishment is unfounded, characterizing the event as nothing more than an expression of free speech and dissent, however inappropriate it might have been.
To punish the dissenters would therefore be setting a dangerous precedent, potentially limiting the expression of free speech on campuses in the future.
Though this sounds like a good story line, nothing could be further from the truth.
The disruptors engaged in an orchestrated attempt to silence a person with whom they happened to disagree.
They were neither expressing their opinions nor protesting, but attempting to shut down speech entirely.
One by one, each of the 11 students in the audience individually rose to shout at the ambassador as he attempted to speak, and one by one each was escorted out, only to be followed by other interruptions minutes later.
In the words of Erwin Chemerinksy, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, “The Muslim Student Union orchestrated a concerted effort to disrupt the speech. One student after another stood and shouted so that the ambassador could not be heard. Each student was taken away only to be replaced by another doing the same thing.”
What occurred that night was a calculated act of censorship, and the only free speech violated was that of Oren and the members of his audience.
Defenders of the Irvine 11 refer to the First Amendment and then proceed to defend and vindicate the 11 students in a twisted and perverse mockery of the principle of free speech.
There is a clear distinction between the occasional heckling protester and an organized, coordinated effort to prevent someone from speaking — in this instance, it was the latter.
The behavior displayed by the 11 students represents the antithesis of a university as a place where the free exchange of ideas can occur, and it is fortunate UC Irvine and the district attorney have chosen to handle the matter with such resolve.
To have done anything less would have sent the dangerous message that it is acceptable to silence the voices of those with whom you disagree.
A university should refuse to tolerate this kind of behavior.
What level of punishment the students deserve is a matter of the court, but what is absolutely clear to any observer is the repulsive nature of the act.
It is especially unfortunate because those 11 students might have learned a thing or two from the Princeton-educated historian and foreign policy expert had they bothered to hear him out.
The YouTube video tells the full story of students who were combative, instead of the popular story line that says they were peaceful protestors.
Those 11 students embarrassed themselves and put their entire university to shame. They did not exercise their right to free speech, but wrongly manipulated the First Amendment to defend themselves.

Well said.
This is BS. You obviously have no idea what you are talking about.
Good comment! You obviously have no idea how to use the comment box.
This article was spot-on.  Maybe you’re just upset that you can’t dispute it.
Not to change the subject but you say that a University is a place for a free exchange of ideas. What I constantly see is liberal students shouting down conservative speakers with no consequences whatsoever. Many times the faculty that has brainwashed these students are also involved and again, no consequences. We also see times where liberal students protest conservative commencement speakers on college campuses…where is the free exchange?
When these free-thinking, tolerant students set a better example of listening to somebody that THEY may not agree with then maybe others will notice.
Almost 2 years ago we had a panel here at USC discussing the 2009 Gaza conflict. The panel (moderated by Dr. Laurie Brand director of the School of International Relations) was made up of Israeli and Arab students who had experiences with the issue. I was one of the speakers that day. We were expecting to see a big number of students from Hillel and SC students for Israel (among other pro -Israel students) at the event. However, what we were not expecting, was their demeanor that day.  Every time one of the Arab students, including myself, had something to say, the pro-Israel students made sure he/she had a hard time talking. Even, the moderator, Dr. Brand, was also heckled every time she tried to intervene in order to stop the disruptions. Needless to say, it was very frustrating for the speakers and Dr. Laurie.
I guess the pro-Israel students were protected by their right to free speech that day. It seems that this right is only justifiable if you re on the right side of the argument. I am sorry, but  arguing that these students deserved the verdict simply because they had prior-intentions of their actions, then I guess this would criminalizes any person who plans, organizes, and participates in planned public demonstrations. What good is your interpretation of the right to free speech if it precludes organized public demonstration?? Isn’t that essentially the whole purpose behind the freedom of speech?
Nice try using a personal story.  I’ve been to many events like that and never seen pro-Israel students behaving anything like those 11 Muslim students.  Sure, sometimes there are a few hecklers, but never a coordinated attempt to disrupt someones speech.
At Dr. Finkelstein’s talk here recently on Operation Cast Lead (“This Time We Went Too Far”), the students in opposition to his poistion walked out in unison as a protest (slight disruption but a disruption nonetheless). There were only a few opposition students to ask questions and he went out of his way to make sure that they had the first opportunity to do so. I’m guessing that Amb. Oren was not about to be as gracious. Someone wrote that he had to leave to catch a Lakers game. I’m glad that good seats for NBA basketball are a higher priority to him than fairly addressing the issues of apartheid that he remains a prominent apologist for. It’s not like lives are on the line or anything.

pure lies
and why the majority of america is  not on the side of the islamists
Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable. ~ John F. Kennedy
Some people seem to want it both ways. I was the advisor to a student atheist group (no longer active) years ago. I tried to get co-sponsors to get a discussion panel going that would include Dr. Norman Finkelstein. I was told specifically by the other side that they were not interested, and when I inquired as to what the problem with Dr. Finkelstein was, the answer was simply, “Alan Dershowitz doesn’t like him.”
Since that time other persistent student groups have been able to bring Dr. Finkelstein to campus (why isn’t he teaching here? – he’s indicated that he very fond of USC and its student body) a number of times, and a complaint made was that it presents only one side of the story. This seemed extremely disingenuous to me, as when the opportunity was not only provided, but was made requesting such participation in the first place, it was rejected in no uncertain terms.
For those wanting to get an idea of what a genuine exchange has the potential of delivering, please do a search for –
– Norman Finkelstein reviews Michael Oren’s Six Days of War – 
You’ll find it at a site created by the survivors of the USS Liberty, who are also much maligned and have gone virtually without anyone fighting for their right to have their message heard. In fact just the opposite. They went through proper channels to file a war crimes report. Filing this report is meant to bring about specific investigations to determine the validity of the report. 
Their responsibility was not to prove their case with the report they filed, but to provide enough substance that an investigation of war crimes was initiated. This was not done.
The Irvine 11 got their “day in court” that a lot of similar protests were not subjected to. A group seeking their day in court, is denied it, though the law indicates that should be not be the case.
Cui bono?
The “Irvine 11” and the muslum student union and their supporters just don’t get it, because they continue to show a lack of any understanding of the 1st Amendment and the rights in America that they seek to trample upon. As Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of UC Irvine’s law school, so aptly stated, “There’s no free speech right to disrupt an event. … It’s not a matter of free speech because there’s no free speech right to shut someone down.” That is the fact none of these people can comprehend as they blindly shout that their 1st Amendment Rights are somehow violated. 
The simple concept that they cannot comprehend is that while they had every right to hold a peaceful protest outside the event (but that is not the type of people they are, nor the the type of message or world they seek), they had no right to enter in order to disrupt and prevent the event. They showed they are actually opposed to free speech, not faslely claimed supporters of free speech. Democracy and free speech live, not die, by the correct verdict, and this was the correct verdict to protect democracy. If they held an event to support their rhetoric, and it was interrupted by a planned conspiracy to prevent their event and speech, they would want to have those responsible arrested. These people did not “st[and] up against the face of oppression” as they spout — they are seeking to oppress rights of others that they disagree with. It is called hypocrisy and is anti-American.
Shouting down a speaker is not activism. Standing outside with prepared materials on your criticisms of the speaker to hand out is activism. Working to bring a Palestinian speaker to campus is activism. Having incisive questions prepared for Q&A is activism. Posting a rebuttal to the speaker’s points after the fact is activism.
If this group had engaged in real activism, they could have enhanced the academic experience of our public universities instead of undermining it.
Agreed.  100%
These undeserving students should be thankful for the blessing of a world-class education, rather than disrupting a legitimate speaker with whom they disagree, and hiding behind “free speech.”  If a similar disruption took place during their trial, the protestors would be thrown in jail.
“It is especially unfortunate because those 11 students might have learned a thing or two from the Princeton-educated historian and foreign policy expert had they bothered to hear him out.
The YouTube video tells the full story of students who were combative, instead of the popular story line that says they were peaceful protestors.”
These two parts of the article are the most ridiculous and ignorant. The first quote shows that the writer has minimal or no understanding of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict and it’s history. These students (whether the writer agrees or not) were speaking out against someone they felt was a murderer. I know a few of the students. Some of them lost relatives in the bombing of Gaza. They have legitimate grievances. To boldly state that they “could have learned a thing or two” is blatantly ignorant. Regardless of whether he was Princeton Educated or from DeVry Institute…the students felt he was a murderer. 
The second quote also shows lack of understanding of non-violent or peaceful protest. Protesters throughout history did not, for the most part, stay peaceful aka polite/respectful. Gandhi himself was noted to be very aggressive in his tactics. Peaceful refers to the non-violent nature of protest…these students did not pick up weapons. 
As for the freedom of speech issue…It’s a hard decision to make. The Muslim Student Union was singled out by the school and silenced even before the event. The president of the MSU was personally called and told not to demonstrate. This is a limitation of free speech as well. Although willingly trying to silence someone you don’t agree with also seems like a limitation of free speech.
The students may think Michael Oren is a murder or war criminal or whatever else they would like to think.   They are free to think whatever they please.
They could have exercised their rights of free speech and demonstrated outside the event.
The students were wrong to prevent a speaker invited to the campus from speaking and being heard.  And the Muslim Student Union acted inappropriately in coordinating this and in misrepresenting its involvement to University officials. 
If someone like Salam Fayyad came to speak on the campus and a Jewish group planned to stay for the majority of the program with intent and did disrupt his lecture throughout the entire lecture, I know plenty of Jewish people with relatives in Israel would be very upset.
This article is chauvinistic and ridiculous. The defense determined that the total time taken by the Irvine 11 to peacefully protest in an organized fashion was only 2% of the entire presentation. Most of the disruption was due to the dean’s chauvinistic remarks toward the MSU during the meeting and the pro-Zionists’ jeering. 
Furthermore, Michael Oren left early to go to a Lakers game and was never planning on staying for Q&A in the first place. Oren limited participation more than the Irvine 11 did with his own selfish motives. 
Protests around the country involve disruption and no one is arrested or charged and they are organized in the same way the Irvine 11 organized their dissent. 
And this is all besides the point because I believe a racist and war criminal like Oren shouldn’t be permitted to speak at all. I wish they had shut him down. But the fact of the matter is they didn’t and all these right-wingers, including the more than likely Zionist author of this garbage, are leading a mob against peaceful protestors. Its selective punishment, its unjust. 
All charges should be dropped against the 11.
Of course the defense said it took 2% of the time….that’s what the defense is supposed to say!  Watch the video and you’ll see differently.
Michael Oren had another arrangement he had to go to, and yes he was going to do a Q&A but didn’t have time to because of the disruptions.  Officials like him have schedules to keep to.
Protests around the country involve disruption and a) often do lead to arrests  b) each state has its own laws (shocker!)  c) protests are often legally registered beforehand and d) disrupt once or twice but do not methodically attempt to stop someone from speaking.
It is very good that a person like you who doesn’t understand the First Amendment in this country isn’t writing our laws.  Michael Oren is not even close to a racist or war criminal.  Like the article says he went to Princeton and is a historian representing a country.  Even if he was a despicable human being, he has a right to free speech at his own event.  
Ever heard the phrase “I may not agree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it”?  Guess that’s too far over your head Doug.
All charges should be upheld.
It was not Michael Oren event. It was a one sided event sponsored by the University that is supposed to represent all sides of an issue.
You’re so utterly and completely wrong XM.  It was a speaker event, nothing more nothing less.  It was not a debate, forum, or anything of that sort.  The university hosted it on campus, but that’s all. 
The students behavior was unacceptable and criminal, as the author adeptly explained.
“And this is all besides the point because I believe a racist and war criminal like Oren shouldn’t be permitted to speak at all.”
This was all I needed to read.  According to you only one perspective on the conflict has the right to be heard at UC Irvine.
The video footage is at odds with the claims in this article. The students DID express their views in a PEACEFUL manner and did NOT shut down the speech. They interrupted the speech, but left after shouting a couple of sentences. The pro-Oren attendees were MORE disruptive than these 10 students.
He didn’t say they were violent John.  And they did not leave after a couple sentences.  They left after interrupting 11 separate times (duh).  The pro-Oren attendees were “disruptive” only to make noise so that those thugs wouldn’t have a platform to yell.
Don’t try to uncharacteristic what video.  People all have eyes and can watch and see that you’re lying!
Oren is your typical Israel liar.
You are a typical idiot.  Whether he was a “liar” or not makes absolutely no difference to this discussion.  It’s about free speech and not silencing someone, whether you agree or disagree with him.  Learn a thing or too.
A misdemeanor? Are you serious? These kids had enough courage to make a statement on behalf of an issue they are strongly passionate about. Something we all forget to do. Maybe they went about it in a wrong way- nevertheless, kudos to them for having the courage to stand up, and stand out! That is how changes are made. A misdemeanor is a disgusting charge. But then again, so are the illegal settlements.
it is against california law to disrupt a legal assembly
learn the law
Agreed !!
They tried to limit the free speech of others.  Don’t you understand that?  Watch the video before defending the 11 criminals.
The BREAKING UP last week of a press conference in Madison, Wisconsin OFF CAMPUS by demonstrators recruited by telephone by UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS
resulted in no arrests. The press conference concerned racial discrimination on the part of admissions officials of the U of Wisconsin.
So, is it the difference between Wisconsin and Orange County? The Ambassador from Israel and researchers presenting statistical findings? Both?
These things make a difference(s), it would seem.
Dude come on take your meds EVERY day…
Rude, nasty, uncivil and disruptive, but I suppose we should be grateful that they didn’t resort to throwing objects or worse violence.
Estee,
Watch the two videos.   They aren’t nearly the same.   Then again, people like you probably never listen to reason and that’s why you are on the wrong side of this argument.
Jordan
what a crappy article…no body got charged for disturbing obamas speech
Watch the youtube video.  They didn’t just disturb it, they tried to kill it.
Watch it and you’ll see.
Wow, I must say that I’m impressed for once.
I am a frequent critic of the Daily Trojan, and often find the opinion articles to often be unimaginative and poorly written.  But here is an articulate, concise, and meaningful body of work.
As for if I agree with the opinion, I’ll have to watch the YouTube video and see.
Congrats DT on the job well done.
Throw them out of the meeting, but to prosecute is absurd and un-american.
These people actually eclipsed the free speech of others.  I actually agree with their statements about Israel, and I would support their right to protest outside the meeting.  However, your free speech ends when it impedes mine.  There were reasonable alternatives given to these students to have a forum, they ignored the opportunity and instead chose to limit the speech of others.  Regardless of the fact that I agree with them, I also have to agree with the DA that they went about the process all wrong.  What’s more, it is classless to now claim ‘anti muslim persecution’ and victimhood status.  This does nothing more than dilute the cases of the actual victims of Israel’s occupation of Palestine.
I may not agree with you but your comments give me great comfort.
Thanks for posting.   I have been reading up on this incident and you are a rare person who agrees with the students but also point out that their tactics were wrong because they violate the rights of others.
I don’t know if the MSU has an official position on how to resolve the conflict.  I do know they invite Abdul Malik Ali to speak on the campus every year.   Aside from blaming zionist Jews for 911 to the Danish cartoons, Malik Ali openly supports Hamas.   Hamas is committed to the destruction of Israel.   I don’t know if that if that is the position that  these students were standing up for so passionately (as some like to point out).   
I have read that Oren said he supported the two state solution during a lecture at UC Irvine in the past.  That the position I hold.
And did u know that the College Republicans at UCI disrupted Abdul Malik Ali’s speach. Guess what ? No charges.
Oren supported two state solution !!!!! Except he won’t tell us what the boundaries of Israel are !!!!
Barak offered borders.   Clinton offered borders.  Olmert offered borders.   None were accepted by the Palestinian leaders.  If Oren did say what thought the borders should be we wouldn’t know it if we watched the lecture at UC Irvine.
The borders will have to be negotiated if there is going to be peace.  Personally, I think the something close to Clinton Parameters is a just solution  
I’d need to get more details on the college Republican.  They may have been douches too.
If other student groups are a bunch of douchebags, it doesn’t make the Irvine 11 any less guilty of being douchebags.
I don’t think the point of the article is that the students should be charged criminally.   I took the main thesis of Justin’s essay as being that it is unacceptable to silence the voices of those with whom you disagree.   A university should refuse to tolerate this kind of behavior.
I missed Mr. Davoff’s Op/Ed describing why the 5 Jewish activists who shouted down Prime Minister Netanyahu in New Orleans Nov. 2010 should have had charges brought against them by a DA.
I don’t think Mr. Davidoff said how/to what degree he supports prosecution.  He was just saying that what they did was wrong and definitely deserves punishment, however harsh the punishment might be.
I’m not familiar with the incident you refer to, but did those activists take up 30-45 min with their protests like these students did?  I doubt it.
Rae Abileah, 28, a member of Jewish Voice For Peace (JVP), disrupted PM Netanyahu’s address to Congress this spring by yelling and screaming. Capital police arrested Ms. Abileah for “disturbing Congress while it is in session” and “disorderly conduct.” 
Estee Chandler whose letter I am responding to is an official of JVP. knows Ms. Abileah and knows that Ms. Abileah was indeed arrested for disruption in DC.
Disrupting lawful assemblies such as Amb. Oren’s speech is illegal in California. Some people who disrupt speeches get away with it, just as some people who engage in other crimes get away with those crimes as well. But Ms. Abileah did not get away with it, and there is no reason for anyone else to either.
A typo in the above message by me incorrectly states the nature of the charge against Ms. Abileah. She was charged with disrupting Congress, not disturbing it.
Electronic Intifada: May 24, 2011 – “Abileah was charged with disorderly conduct and disrupting Congress, as she told Democracy Now on 25 May video and transcript.”
Good piece.
I read a story today where a defense attorney for the students,  Jacqueline Goodman, has likened the 10 students to Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. 
“It’s rude, absolutely,” Goodman said, referring to the 10 disruptions made by the students. “These are people who stood up because their conscience demanded it. The government wants you to call them criminals. They’re using all their might to call these extraordinary young men — these heroes — criminals.”
See must be on some good drugs.
Hahah must be some veeeery strong stuff.
haha ha ha haha ha ha ha ummm not funny at all .. just because you disagree with someone doesn’t mean that he/she is on drugs. this just shows you narrow minded people cannot appreciate anyone else’s point of view except your own. Oren held a microphone..could’ve been brave enough to stop the arrests and address them. But he was on a mission to cover up Israel’s dirty work, that’s why he chose to continue with his pointless foreign minister jokes. You need to think of context to understand why the students did what they did. Oren was not “shut down”.. he cant possibly be shut down by 11 students.. he has the world’s media at his service. stop making the event sound like a person that 11 students “killed”.. its a stupid event with a powerful tyrant guest speaker who wasnt brave enough to face the truth
This is a classic post – Narrow minded people who cannot appreciate anyone else’s point of view?    Hmmmm, that sound familiar…who are you trying to defend?
The Irvine 11 did not go to the meeting with the goal of having a dialogue.   
From Michelle Woo’s article in the OC Weekly:
One email contained the minutes from an MSU meeting, which stated that the goal of the protest was to “send the speaker a message” and show him that “he can’t just go to a campus and say whatever he wants.”   Included were plans to “disrupt the whole event” and “shut down with individual disruption.”
Okay, I am out.   I’ll go back to watching porn and rubbing one out.   This topic has lost my interest.

A few days ago, my roommates and I were talking about which first names and surnames sound good together.
We came up with the name “Ella Wellman.” Looks neutral enough, right? Try saying it out loud. It sounds a lot like “ell-oh-ell, man.” As in, laughing out loud, man. It sounds like something you’d find in a text message.

That we even made this observation suggests internet slang is slipping into the real world.
Apparently, my roommates and I are not alone. When I searched “using internet slang,” the first result Google suggested was “using internet slang in real life.”
Rather than a sign of deterioration, internet slang is a sign of evolution in the English language.
I followed this suggestion, and my screen became filled with people either celebrating the practice or complaining about how annoying it is. Love it or hate it, it’s a thing, but not necessarily a bad thing.
Internet slang might seem like the downfall of English. I’ve heard many professors complain about the way abbreviations and excessive lowercase letters slip into our essays. Perhaps internet writing is not appropriate for the classroom or the workplace right now, but one day, it will be. Dictionaries and style guides make languages seem like static entities. In fact, the evolution of language is very alive. They just take longer to grow.
English grows faster than most, and this characteristic is largely a result of ancient war and conquest. Around 450 A.D., Germanic tribes repeatedly invaded the island known today as the United Kingdom. In 1066, the Norman-French did the same.
That’s why English speakers can recognize many words in German and French: English started as a fusion of early versions of these two languages.
Though the Bible, Chaucer and Shakespeare gave English more coherence, its messy beginnings cemented it as a language that can quickly absorb words. Shakespeare himself modified and invented a few of them. Some examples: drugged, puking and gossip. Imagine if we didn’t have the terms to describe these things. What would college be like?
Today, many words with online roots fill gaps in formal language. The word “googled” is one of them. Like the word “kleenex,” it refers to both a brand and something beyond that brand.
“Googled” is a perfect description of a modern act: typing a word or a phrase and seeing where it shows up on the Internet.
Though the word is not yet appropriate for a research paper, people regularly throw it around in class. It’s a word in transition.
Some useful phrases have yet to gain such wide acceptance. “TL,DR” is one of them: “too long, didn’t read.” One can find this abbreviation posted under many blog posts.
It describes a particular feeling many millennials can relate to — the feeling of not wanting to read something long and uninteresting because there are pictures to post and clips to watch.
Right now, there’s no matching phrase in formal English. It’s not exactly wholesome, but then again, neither is “gossip.”
Still, some people who accept internet slang might take issue with internet grammar. But grammar evolves too, and it is evolving in interesting ways.
For example, Facebookers often type in all capital letters or omit punctuation. Many people make these technical mistakes quite deliberately.
Capital letters indicate either intensity or fake intensity for the sake of irony; lack of punctuation points to a blasé attitude about language. For a live demonstration of these principles, talk to anyone analyzing a text from his or her crush.
It’s true that not all internet slang has quality. There aren’t millions of Shakespeare-level writers surfing the web.
Not every word, phrase or grammatical idiosyncrasy will become formalized in the year 3000. Some will drop off.
Yet some will live on — and if you think you’ve found a word worth keeping, there’s no shame in using it.

USC’s bookstore merchandise and online items will be getting a new look starting in late September, thanks to a new licensing deal between the university and Marvel Entertainment.
The new line of superhero-inspired merchandise will feature apparel and hats for adults, children and infants. Fans can now combine superheroes with sports and select their Trojan gear from various designs showcasing Marvel’s most recognizable heroes.
The comic enterprise is partnering with USC through Silver Star Merchandising — the apparel merchandiser for the Dallas Cowboys — to create a line of co-branded clothing that pairs Marvel’s most legendary heroes, such as Captain America, the Hulk, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor and Wolverine, with USC’s colors and logos. The merchandise will be available in the USC bookstore, online and in mass and sporting good retailers.
The new deal comes on the heels of USC’s most recent vendor change. Silver Star Merchandising and USC signed a 10-year contract in May, giving the retailer sole rights to manufacture, license and distribute sports apparel at USC’s sporting events and athletic venues, in addition to other mass-market retail channels.
According to Marvel Entertainment, “The collection combines one of the most recognizable athletic programs in the nation with some of the most popular Marvel Super Heroes of all-time including Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and Wolverine…the collection will feature your favorite Super Heroes in USC’s school colors of Cardinal and Gold, along with its Trojan mascot and logos.”

In the midst of an NCAA investigation, the University of North Carolina has vacated 16 football victories from the 2008 and 2009 seasons and reducing scholarships in anticipation for a ruling from the NCAA Committee on Infractions on Oct. 28.  The COI is expected to announce at that time whether the Tar Heels will receive any additional penalties.
North Carolina has also placed its football program on two years of probation. These self-imposed penalties come as a result of the NCAA’s investigation of athletes accepting improper benefits and academic misconduct.
The situation revolving around the football program has left the team in a state of upheaval ever since the alleged violations were brought to light. Fourteen football members missed at least one game due to suspension, and seven missed the whole season. The state of the program hit a low this past summer when head coach Butch Davis was fired just one week before training camp began.
Since the NCAA severely punished USC, schools such as Ohio State, Oregon, Miami and Auburn have all been under much scrutiny for alleged violations.
