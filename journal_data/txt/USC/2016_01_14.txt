With the arrival of the Oscar announcements yesterday morning, it’s clear that Hollywood wastes no time in looking towards the future — despite the fact that the Golden Globes were only this past weekend.
Countless methods of nomination predictions circulate the internet each year — will the Cannes Jury Prize or Palme d’Or winners indicate a Best Picture score? Do film festivals or other award ceremonies have any sort of bearing on the Academy Awards? The Golden Globes’ history and lore has been fraught with accusations of illegitimate nominations and wins — so much so that this year’s Globes’ host Ricky Gervais even took a crack at the rumors during his opening monologue. So it begs the question if we should even look at the Globes past to determine the Oscars’ future. In 2012, Argo won both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Picture, as did 12 Years A Slave in 2013. But last year’s Academy Award winner Birdman just barely scored a nomination by the Globes, instead losing out to The Grand Budapest Hotel for Best Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.
However, regardless of outcome, it’s clear that this Oscars race will be an interesting one, despite the fact that more than a few filmmakers were definitely snubbed by the Academy this go around.
Most notably, The Martian director Ridley Scott was left out of the running — for reasons unknown to the public, even though many, such as The Hollywood Reporter’s Scott Feinberg awards forecaster, predicted not only a nomination but a win for the famed British director responsible for big action blockblusters such as Alien, Robin Hood and 1991’s cult feminist film Thelma and Louise. Steven Spielberg was also left in the cold in terms of directing nomination for his Cold War era Bridge of Spies, despite scoring a nomination for both Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture. Aaron Sorkin might’ve also woken up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, for his screenplay for Steve Jobs was noticeably forgotten for Best Adapted Screenplay; perhaps his fast-paced unrealistic dialogue and theatrical three-act structure was a little too much to bear for this year’s voters, who chose to nominate The Big Short, Brooklyn, Carol, The Martian and indie-darling Room instead.
Another surprise this year came in the form of a nomination for Straight Outta Compton for Best Original Screenplay — many thought it deserved possibly a Best Picture and Best Director nomination for director F. Gary Gray, but no one really predicted it could get nominated for writing. Quentin Tarantino — normally a screenwriter’s darling — was snubbed when his film The Hateful Eight failed to score a writing nomination. Likewise for many black filmmakers and actors this year — not only was Gray overlooked, but so was Creed’s Ryan Coogler alongside Will Smith and Samuel L. Jackson’s performances in Concussion and The Hateful Eight, respectively. Once again, bloggers and journalists alike will have no trouble claiming that the Academy Awards continue to perpetuate a white landscape that doesn’t make room for the diversity audiences have cried out for for so long.
Those celebrating this morning will probably be the infamous filmmakers of The Revenant, for their hard work certainly paid off in the form of 12 nominations, including best picture and best director for Alejandro Gonzales Inñáritu. Additionally, George Miller was awarded with both Best Picture and Best Director nominations for his high-octane, vividly over-saturated apocalyptic action film Mad Max: Fury Road. Additionally, small time features such as Spotlight, Room and Brooklyn did well despite being of the more independent fares — each of them earning nominations for both Best Picture and Best Screenplay (either adapted or original). Largely left out of the race was Denis Villenuve’s Mexican drug war film Sicario — even though many believed Benicio Del Toro’s mysterious and powerful portrayal of a civil service lawyer turned vengeful hitman deserved at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, the film managed to score nominations for both Best Film Score and Best Cinematography, a win that should definitely go to the illustrious director of photography Roger Deakins if there is any justice this awards season. But that, as we know, remains to be seen.
The Academy Awards will be held at the Dolby Theatre and air live Feb. 28.

British actor Alan Rickman died on Thursday from an ongoing battle with cancer. From the screen to the stage, Rickman has dazzled audiences with his performances, showing raw emotion and versatility in roles such as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series and Judge Turpin in the film musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. His death comes as a huge shock and tragedy to the entertainment world, and he will forever be loved in the hearts of millions.
Rickman first began his acting career at the age of 26 when he received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. After his studies, he went on to theatre and was first recognized in Les Liaisons Dangereuses on Broadway in 1987, getting nominated for a Tony for his role as Vicomte de Valmont. The next year, he took on one of his most defining roles as Hans Gruber in Die Hard, which began his career in the film industry, getting roles such as Jamie in Truly Madly Deeply, Alexander Dane in Galaxy Quest and of course, Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series. His performances through the years on both the stage and the screen earned him many different awards, including BAFTAs, Emmys and Golden Globes. Yet, Rickman never regarded the awards as important, but the work. “Actors are agents of change,” he said. “A film, a piece of theatre, a piece of music or a book can make a difference. It can change the world.”
While he was an incredible actor, Rickman was also a dear friend and mentor to many. British actress Emma Thompson wrote,
“His capacity to fill you with a look or lift you with a word. The intransigence which made him the great artist he was — his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him.”
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe spoke about his experiences working with Rickman.
“Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career,” he said. “Film sets and theatre stages are all far poorer for the loss of this great actor and man.”
Fans across the world will remember Rickman for the rest of their lives and careers, never forgetting the man with the rich, smooth voice, or the man that made them cry in the final Harry Potter film. Rickman’s performances and spirit have made a tremendous impact on the entertainment industry, and although he has passed, the world will remember him “always.”

After releasing one song per month for a year on SoundCloud,  London-based synth-pop duo Oh Wonder is finding that fame is coming far more quickly than anticipated.  In the midst of their first American tour, the duo made up of Anthony West and Josephine Vander Gucht headlined the first of two shows at El Rey Theatre Wednesday night.  The show was a nearly sold-out performance.
The pair began issuing one track each month for a year on SoundCloud, then compiled their songs for an album that was released in September 2015. Their aim was “to challenge ourselves as songwriters.” Their singles have garnered more than 100 million streams across SoundCloud and Spotify, including being featured in the Spotify Viral 50 top 10 in the U.S., U.K. and Global charts.  Their sold-out show emphasizes the idea they’re a rising act to keep an eye on.
The L.A. native band GEMS opened up the show with their down-tempo electro-pop sound, performing six songs to the full crowd. Their aesthetic is similar to that of acts such as The Naked and Famous and ASTR.  Five of the songs the band performed came off their debut album Kill the One You Love, with the other being “Medusa” from their EP. After GEMS finished their performance, Oh Wonder drenched the crowd in the poppy beat of “Livewire,” a song that enhanced Vander Gucht’s vocals. The duo played nearly every track from their self-titled debut album.
The signature sound of these classically trained instrumentalists, who also write, produce and mix their own tracks, is crystal clear. The male-female vocals are always upfront in the mix, as they sign over sparse beats and spacious settings. Oh Wonder’s songs are slow jams, similar to the electronic ballads born out and started by musicians such as The xx and James Blake. Each tune builds nicely; it’s not only the songwriting, but also the arrangement and dynamics of production.  In the song “Dazzle,” for instance, West’s vocals provoked a notorious reaction from crowd, which was largely female (many of whom were with their significant others).  The couples serenading each other during “Landslide,” was also refreshing. “I’ll be there for you, I’ll be there for you,” they chanted.
The duo performed as a big “OW” light shined brightly behind them, changing colors throughout the set. West and Vander Gucht claimed they were extremely grateful, talking about their excitement about performing on Conan Thursday night.
As the show came to a close, Oh Wonder saved their most popular song for last, “Technicolor Beat.”  It seemed no one wanted it to end; in fact, West apologized to the disappointed crowd for not writing a longer album.
Oh Wonder will head to San Francisco Friday, after their two-night main stay at El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.  their two-night mainstay at  El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.

Someone higher up made the questionable decision to give me a weekly column to tell you, or rather, rant to you about my week’s musical ponderings. I could try to explain this, or I could just dive right in. Being on the lazy side, I’ll opt for the latter.
There are a multitude of successful bands who have proven to be skilled at what they do; they’re passionate about their craft, authentic for their fans, who also find themselves victims of the new phenomenon of music listening: genre bias. Obviously, genre bias has always existed to some degree. But with the birth of the internet, genres and artists have emerged that never would’ve been discovered without it, as well as a new forum for fans and critics to discuss their opinions.
Suddenly, genres are more than just musical preferences, they’re your identity. Hipsters sneer at the pop-preps, classic rock heads claim real music is dead and Hot Topic makes bank off the backs of pop punk. These types of successful, skilled and passionate bands, such as Muse, Taylor Swift and Mumford & Sons, find that they’ve become a new channel for music fans to assert their dominance through hatred and critiquing. For years, I was no better than them. Everyone from celebrities I idolized to kids on my high school campus would trash-talk Coldplay. It didn’t take me long to buy into the peer pressure. I would loudly sigh if they came on the radio, roll my eyes if I met a fan and vocally declare my disdain for Chris Martin. But if you stayed calm enough to ask me why I was so down on them (which few were), you’d see I had no reason except that it was cool. The latest trend in music is hatred.
Last semester, I was lucky enough to intern at Billboard. I sat beside my senior editor, Katie Atkinson, and we often talked about our personal tastes. At one point, she got the opportunity to cover a Coldplay concert. The excitement in her eye when she got that email and in her voice as she recapped the event to me the next day made me wonder, why the hell did I avoid Coldplay all these years? So with that in mind, I’m devoting this week’s column to the bands that have battled bad reps merely for being popular or belonging to a certain genre. And of course, we’re going to start with Coldplay.
On Monday, I put my shoes on and headed to class. I forwent my beloved Cage the Elephant, took a deep breath and clicked play on Coldplay’s most recent album, A Head Full of Dreams. I eased myself in by starting with their Tove Lo collab “Fun,” and what I heard almost immediately was a big f-ck you to me. Throughout the album, I got this message over and over. As the band played, their sound evolved and Martin sang, all I found was four musicians who didn’t care at all about those who love to hate them. They didn’t care that hipster credibility is rooted in despising bands just like them. In the electronic post mix, the rock-influenced instrumentation and the pop-beat, there was an authenticity that spoke volumes. I’m a creature of habit, so I can’t deny that after one listen to the album, I returned to my normal morning music.  I haven’t given myself the chance to address whether Coldplay is a new favorite for me. It would take multiple listenings to move past this realization and into the actual music itself. What I did realize is that they don’t deserve the bad rep, but they’re going to get it anyway. Those who don’t let the opinions of others stop them typically get the brunt of them.
That evening, I couldn’t help but think about this theme once again. What other bands have been given certain reputations unfairly? And had I always bought into this bias? I felt awful. I pride myself on loving music with no genres left untouched, and the bands I follow on Instagram range from The Front Bottoms to Raury, Nicki Minaj to Taylor Swift and whatever classic rock idols have managed to adapt online. I tried to convince myself I wasn’t like that, so I reminded myself of the Fall Out Boy albums I still buy on iTunes despite having Spotify, all the times I recommend Selena Gomez’s newest album to friends and that I study to the sound of Linkin Park’s greatest hits. I realized that, though I love to paint myself as some saint of musical taste — a country lover, pop music dancer and indie aficionado — even I have fallen prey to this latest trend. All I can hope is that owning up to it is the first step to recovery.

Like many Trojan hopefuls, spring admit freshman Angel Viscarra  knew  USC  was his dream school as soon as he stepped on campus as a high school junior. He toured the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, spoke to a couple of students and within a few hours knew that this was where he wanted to spend his four years of college.
When an acceptance arrived on decision day, it seemed that Viscarra’s dreams had come true. But when he opened the cardinal red packet, he only had a few moments to celebrate before noticing an addition to the bottom corner of his acceptance letter — “Spring 2016.”
“It was bittersweet,” Viscarra said. “When you’re a senior, you’ve been working towards college for so long, you just want to go. I didn’t doubt for a second that I wanted to go to USC, but it definitely made people around me question whether that was the best way to go for me.”
This is the story of many spring admits: the mix of excitement and disappointment at an acceptance, the semester spent watching as other students attend classes and football games and finally, the nerves of starting school when most freshmen have already been attending for a semester.
Though it allows more students to attend USC, the spring admit system can create a difficult transition for spring admit students. With help from the Undergraduate Student Government, the Office of Admissions is working on improving this system.
The spring admit system was a foreign concept to many of Viscarra’s peers. This lack of awareness made Viscarra nervous about the process up until his first day of classes. But hearing from Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath at his orientation helped reassure him.
Sampath was also a spring admit and as nervous as any other student about starting in the spring. Now, as the president of USG, she reassures spring admits at orientation that the time they begin school has no correlation with their success.
“Seeing someone who has been so successful in her time at USC, and seeing that she had the same start as me — that was really inspiring,” Viscarra said. “I think it just proves that all that matters is how hard you work, how hard you want it once you get here.”
The decision to make a spring admittance process began in the mid-’90s, as USC admission became increasingly competitive.
Originally, the admissions department developed the idea of creating a waitlist in order to limit the number of admitted students. This idea was rejected by former dean of admission Joseph Allen, who believed that waitlists were unnecessarily difficult on students.
The main problem with waitlists, according to Director of Admission Kirk Brennan, was that they forced students to put off the stressful decision of choosing a university. Putting a student on the waitlist meant that the school, city and people that would dominate the next four years of a potential student’s life would be completely uncertain until the summer.
Instead, Allen suggested the University look into accepting students in the spring. Due to the fluctuation in enrollment between the fall and spring semesters — a combination of early graduation, study abroad and dropping out — he noted that the University had extra space to fill with new students. This, Allen felt, would be the best way to welcome in more students to USC without a waitlist program.
Brennan acknowledged that the spring admit group typically falls into the lower range of scores in their admitted class. However, he added that the students’ lower scores were offset by outside factors — such as leadership and success in extracurricular activities — that made the students strong candidates for USC.
This was true for Viscarra, who said that his test scores were lower than the average USC admit. Instead, his depth of involvement in school organizations strengthened his application. Still, he felt that many people unfamiliar with the spring admit process judged him for his admittance.
“There were definitely a lot of uncomfortable questions, especially when I was going to community college in the fall and everyone else was at school,” Viscarra said. “I had to explain that I was still admitted, just like everyone else, but I had this gap semester before I could start.”
The stereotype that spring admits are less qualified to be Trojans is one of the major factors for the separation that many spring admits feel, according to Viscarra. But other aspects of their college experience can make spring admits feel different or left out.
One of the major factors that causes spring admits to feel estranged from their freshman community is a lack of housing options. Without open spaces at on-campus dorms, a majority of spring admits are placed in off-campus housing options.
“The transition was definitely hard on me in terms of noticing that other students were able to live in on-campus places like New/North,” Sampath said. “I know that’s a huge problem for spring admits in general, is that everyone’s kind of pushed off to the side and lives in off-campus residences.”
This is an issue Sampath has brought up in USG meetings in the past, and that will be addressed by the extended dorm options provided by the University Village.
Though housing is always a major concern, the Office of Admission has noted there are many other smaller issues that can make the spring admission process less than ideal. One of these is the moment Viscarra experienced — the excitement of opening an acceptance, only to realize it is for spring admission.
To combat this combination of excitement and disappointment, Brennan said that future packets will be color coded. Spring admission will come in gold envelopes while fall admission will come in white envelopes, and students will be notified beforehand what the difference in color means. Brennan hopes that this will allow students to have accurate expectations before they even open the envelope.
The most recent initiative from the admission department creates more opportunities for international spring admits to take transferrable courses during the fall semester before they arrive at USC. According to Brennan, the University established partnerships with American-accredited overseas institutions to establish a “fast-track” admissions process for international USC spring admits.
The initiative started with the American University of Paris two years ago and added three international schools last year. The program has been a success for some students, who now have the opportunity to take classes and stay on track for a four-year graduation.
Brennan emphasized that the Office of Admissions is always striving to listen to students to improve the overall experience of being a spring admit.
His hope is to continue creating new initiatives that will ease the process. In the end, Brennan’s ultimate goal is for students to understand that spring admits are the same as any other student, regardless of when they arrive on campus.
“They absolutely belong here, and we turned away over 40,000 other students in place of that student,” Brennan said. “I think spring students should be proud to be here, and should forget as soon as they can that they had to start a semester later.”

Best in his class · Mark Kann won many teaching awards.
Mark Kann, a professor of political science and history, passed away last Tuesday. He was 68.
His son Simon Kann described him as a “lifelong educator and scholar” who “dedicated his life to educating students and to being a teacher and mentor to them.”
Kann, who received his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1975, joined USC’s political science department that same year. He served as the chair of the political science department from 2001 to 2004 and also taught in the Thematic Option program. He retired after 38 years of teaching at USC.
His long-time colleague Carol Thompson, a retired professor of political science, spoke about his dedication to the Thematic Option program.
“His interest in teaching was to learn from his students,” Thompson said. “Instead of teaching them, he would simply guide them in their exploration of the various theories.”
Over the years, Kann received many teaching awards, including the USC Innovative Teaching Award, once in 1985 and once in 1999. He was selected as one of “The Ten Best Teachers in California”by California Magazine.
“He didn’t just lecture and say this is what happened in this year, this is what happened in this year,” Simon said. “He helped people figure out how to analyze any kind of problem and how to communicate through a variety of persuasive arguments and discussions.”
Associate Vice Provost Robin Romans, Kann’s former student and colleague, said Kann enjoyed using unconventional methods to distill complex political theories down into the context of everyday situations.
Romans recalled Kann’s unique style in teaching a course on civil disobedience. In the hopes they would apply what they had learned to question his authority, he told his students that their third midterm grade would depend on being able to write down the names and phone numbers of all their classmates. Although most of the class obeyed, a couple refused.
“There was a lesson learned, and that was really creative,” Romans said.
In 1990, Kann founded the Center for Excellence in Teaching, acting as its director for three years before returning to work as a faculty member full time. During that time, he also served as associate dean of graduate studies. In 2000, he spearheaded the Academic Culture Initiative to encourage intellectual interaction between students and faculty outside the classroom.
Kann also authored seven books, edited two books and published dozens of articles on democracy, gender and the founding of America.
Kann is survived by Kathy, his wife of 46 years; his son, Simon; daughter-in-law, Melissa; and his grandchildren, Shane, Andrew and Emma.

Road trippin’ · Junior guard Courtney Jaco and the women’s basketball team head north for two games at Washington and Washington State. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke congratulated her team Tuesday on their greatest accomplishment of the season — becoming an AP Top-25 team. In the 10th week of the season, the Women of Troy rose to take the No. 25 spot in the national rankings.
Standing in the middle of her huddled players, Cooper-Dyke asked if the team knew what they had to do to maintain that ranking in this weekend’s games against Washington and Washington State. The team answered unanimously — win.
“I love to see that focus, that determination, because it means that my girls already know what they have to do,” Cooper-Dyke said. “All the pieces might not be together yet, but they know what needs to be done.”
The Women of Troy were unranked at the start of the season, but climbed to a top 25 ranking for the first time since 2014 after upsetting UCLA Sunday in a tight 71-68 victory. Not only does the ranking bolster confidence, but it also provides an extra expectation for their games this weekend.
“It definitely makes us more of a target for teams when we come into their gym as [No.] 25,” junior guard Courtney Jaco said. “But Coach is always telling us that wearing USC across our chest means that we are someone that other teams want to beat. We’re always going to be ready to fight, ready to compete, and other teams know that. We just have to bring it.”
One of the team’s main focuses for the weekend will be junior Washington guard Kelsey Plum, the leading national scorer in women’s basketball. Averaging 27.3 points per game, Plum is a leftie who needs little space to take a shot or capitalize on a defensive mistake. Washington will base its offense on ball screens to give Plum as many offensive opportunities as possible.
To counter Plum, the Women of Troy will pressure the backcourt and focus on switching ball-screens throughout the game. Post players such as transfer Temi Fagbenle are aware that these switches might leave players rolling down low open, which will force the defense to adjust.
“A lot of our success [against Washington] will come from our defense,” Fagbenle said. “That’s where we feel strongest, I think, is in our ability to guard and pressure other teams.”
It was defense that cemented last week’s upset of UCLA. Holding the Bruins offense to only 24 points in the first half, USC shut down the Bruins’ ability to score and used offensive mistakes to generate points. Riding that UCLA victory and the AP ranking, this weekend has the potential to be a turning point in establishing the Women of Troy as a national contender. But to earn that reputation, they will stick to the same strategy they started the season with — defense first.

The No. 13 men’s volleyball team starts off MPSF play against No. 14 Cal State Northridge Friday and will then look forward to No. 3 Long Beach State Saturday.
The Trojans (0-2, 0-0 MPSF) will look to bounce back after their losses to No. 10 Penn State and No. 7 Ohio State. Even though USC lost, head coach Jeff Nygaard isn’t discouraged by the losses.
“This was just a great experience for us to learn and to grow,” Nygaard said. “And to get back where we want to be.”
Since taking the coaching reigns, Nygaard has seen progress from the team, and he knows that it could take some time for the team to develop between the practice and game scenarios.
For senior libero Brooks Varni, the team’s progress is stemming from their process.
“We just want to stick to the process,” Varni said. “Even though it came with two losses, you just have to trust what we’re doing here.”
Playing in the MPSF is no easy task. Currently, ten of the conference’s 12 teams are ranked in the AVCA Coaches Poll with the Top 5 being all MPSF teams (BYU, UCLA, CSULB, UC Irvine, Hawaii).
Up first for the Trojans are the Matadors of CSUN (5-0, 1-0 MPSF). Northridge is one of eight unbeaten teams in the MPSF. The Matadors were the first team to pick up a conference win after sweeping Cal Baptist.
Northridge dominated at the net against Cal Baptist, out-blocking them 13 to two. For the Trojans to run an effective offense against the Matadors, they will have to challenge the block and attack with a solid swing.
“It’s almost maniacal in how they do it,” Nygaard said. “Their guys are extremely physical.”
Three players to watch for are junior outside hitter Jakub Ciesla, redshirt freshman middle blocker Eric Chance and freshman outside hitter Dimitar Kalchev. The Matadors’ fast blocks come from all three, but mainly Chance (20 blocks) and Ciesla (15 blocks). Offensively, Ciesla, Chance and Kalchev are just as threatening. Ciesla and Kalchev lead the team with 54 and 52 kills, respectively.
Away from the net, Northridge is strong from the service line. Receiving serves well will be key for USC to run their offense effectively and challenge Northridge at the net.
“If we’re able to mitigate their serves and run our offense,” Nygaard said. “We put ourselves in a position to win that match.”
The next night, the Trojans face the 49ers of CSULB (3-0, 0-0 MPSF). Long Beach State runs a bit of a different scheme, but they bring experience to the court.
“They’re going to be extremely experienced at the right positions,” Nygaard said. “They’ve got extreme physicality.”
Freshman outside hitters TJ DeFalco and Kyle Ensing lead the 49ers offense with 37 and 34 kills, respectively. DeFalco was the No. 1 recruit for the Class of 2015.
With the physicality at the net for Long Beach State, Nygaard noted the similarities in the challenges that each opponent will bring to the match. Again, the key for USC will be to run their offense effectively and focus on themselves more so than their opponent.
“If we play our side and take care of our side of the net,” Nygaard said, “We put ourselves in a good chance to win.”
For USC to compete offensively, they’ll need solid performances from junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder and sophomore opposite Jon Rivera, who both lead the team with 18 kills. Senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard will have to maintain a strong presence in the middle at the net. Leonard leads the team with five blocks and has nine kills.
Despite the tough competition throughout the league, Leonard trusts his team’s ability to compete in the MPSF. He recognizes that even in practice they play against “one of the best teams in the country.”
“We go out there, and we do what we got to do on a daily basis,” Leonard said. “It doesn’t matter who’s on the other side of the court.”
Both matches start at 7 p.m. Following the road trip, the team has four days off before taking on UC Santa Barbara at the Galen Center.
No mention of middle Andy Bensch who did not play in the first two matches. What is his situation?

Waiting outside the auxiliary gym at the Galen Center a week before the season opener, I watched as the men’s basketball team filed out into the hallway after practice.
With this being my first year at USC and having never really paid close attention to college hoops, I was largely unfamiliar with the roster and probably recognized no more than two or three players as they walked by me.
It’s fair to say the majority of casual basketball fans around the country would have felt the same way.
USC basketball has long been an afterthought in Los Angeles, hidden in the shadows of two professional teams and “that other” school in Westwood. The Trojans may have served as the city’s de facto pro football team (prior to the NFL’s Rams moving in next season), but spending money and time to watch a mediocre basketball program with three better alternatives was something reserved for die-hard fans.
Perhaps, with Wednesday night’s convincing 89-75 victory over the rival UCLA Bruins on the road — another signature win in a season chock full of surprising triumphs — the tide is changing.
If so, then it is a high tide. This is a team maturing, developing and improving in front of our very eyes, and their last four games stand as hard evidence.
When I interviewed several players and head coach Andy Enfield prior to the season, each spoke individually about the team’s inability to win close games contributing to its 23-41 record over the last two seasons. They chocked it up to inexperience, growing pains and a rebuilding process. Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic told me they lost “seven to eight games” simply because of their rawness; USC was the fourth youngest team in the country last season and indeed lost eight games by five points or less. Sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin stressed that their poor record was not indicative of who they were, that they “weren’t getting blown out” and with better execution, they would be able to win close games.
But talk is cheap, and excuses even cheaper. Despite the young core having another year to grow and mature both physically and mentally, a turnaround season was far from a guarantee. In a preseason media poll, USC was picked to finish tenth in the Pac-12 for the second consecutive season, a sign that few people outside of the coaches and players felt much would change with the program this upcoming season.
Two months later, the Trojans sit in second in the Pac-12 with a record of 4-1 in conference play and 15-3 overall, their best start in more than 20 years. They are about to be ranked in the Top 25 for the first time since 2008. And their journey from “young team with potential” to “legitimate threat” is speeding along with a fervent pace.
A look at their recent stretch of games, and you’ll see why. Against Washington three days into the New Year, the Trojans reverted back to their former selves, blowing a 22-point second half lead in a heartbreaking 87-85 loss to the Huskies. Considering it was just their second conference game, the narrative was easy to predict — the Trojans were still the Trojans, talented yet raw, still unable to finish games.
Somehow, in less than two weeks, that narrative has flipped. Since the loss in Seattle, USC has beaten three quality conference teams, each win getting progressively more satisfying.
First, they finally held off an opponent, hanging on in a 75-65 win over Arizona State in a game that saw the Sun Devils rally from a 17-point deficit to claw within two late in the second half. But the Trojans closed the game on a 10-2 run, showing signs of resiliency and maturity that good teams possess. Then came the instant classic, four-overtime win over No. 7 Arizona, a marathon that more than proved USC belonged in the conversation.
And lastly, Wednesday night’s win at Pauley Pavilion, a complete game from beginning to end. After UCLA jumped out to a 17-13 lead, USC outscored the Bruins 35-13 to end the first half. Up by as many as 21 points in the second half, the Trojans did not waver when UCLA made a run to cut the deficit down to single-digits. Every time the Bruins made a push, the Trojans had an answer, whether it was by drawing a foul or making a three.
A win over UCLA for the first time in three years is significant, no doubt. And while the Trojans’ path to legitimacy is far from complete, with still 13 regular season games remaining in a very tough Pac-12 conference, one thing’s for certain: people know who this team is now.

The start of the spring semester is an exciting one for most USC freshmen. After spending the fall acclimating to USC — and spending winter break in relative boredom at home — the first week of spring is a chance to catch up with friends and begin a new semester with some hard lessons learned.
But the new semester also brings a host of new students to our campus — spring admits. After spending the fall semester avoiding awkward questions from their high school friends, these students are forced to navigate a new environment without the support system that exists for freshmen arriving in August. Unlike their peers who were admitted in the fall, spring admits are often forced to find housing in off-campus apartments without the benefits of residential life. Their Welcome Week pales in comparison to the festivities organized during the start of the year. Even the experience of opening their admissions envelopes — one most Trojans remember fondly — is tinged with disappointment, already generating a sense of isolation from students admitted in the fall.
“[Spring admits] absolutely belong here, and we turned away over 40,000 other students in place of that student,” Director of Admission Kirk Brennan told the Daily Trojan. “I think spring students should be proud to be here, and should forget as soon as they can that they had to start a semester later.”
If this is the case, it begs the question: Why should they have to forget? Spring admits are clearly qualified to be considered Trojans by Brennan’s own admission and by evidence on campus. Our Undergraduate Student Government President is a spring admit, three senior editors of this publication are spring admits and many spring admits achieve great success both in the classroom and out of it.
Instead of forcing spring admits to find their way at USC mid-year, it’s crucial that the University make a more focused effort to get them on campus before spring starts. There should be a housing guarantee for every student with the impending opening of the Village.
The construction of the new Village should go a long way in easing the shortage and ensuring that spring admits are still a valued part of the USC community. It’s easy to forget about these several hundred students when administering the construction of a new structure with bed space for thousands more and geared toward an undergraduate student population of more than 18,000.
Moreover, encouraging spring admits to attend local institutions, such as Santa Monica College or Los Angeles City College, in the fall would allow them to find their way in university life. Part of this support comes from improved communication with students about local education options in the fall and from providing transportation to said colleges, if possible. USC shuttles already go to the University’s research facilities in Marina Del Rey — it could easily make a stop in Santa Monica as well.
If USC were to implement a more comprehensive plan to integrate spring admits in the fall, it wouldn’t be the first plan of its sort. UC Berkeley’s Fall Program for Freshmen allows freshmen admitted in the spring to live in university housing during the fall semester and take classes through UC Berkeley Extension. While a program such as USC Extension does not exist, the University could form similar partnerships with local community colleges and market the opportunity to spring admits as a way to live on campus while participating fully in the experience — including joining academic, professional or social organizations and attending fall football games.
Assimilation of spring admits into campus life needs to exceed the less-spirited welcome events and the lacking assistance currently found on campus. Integration into the University should start before their first steps into a USC classroom.

As a word to the wise, you probably shouldn’t major in basket weaving. Despite being quite the niche career track, it’s also not a degree you might want to spend an upwards of $100,000 to receive. If you’re pursuing higher education today, you will very quickly be faced with the highest tuition and student debt rates of this and the past century, especially at public universities.
With the 2016 presidential election quickly approaching, only one candidate from either party has presented a clear and comprehensive plan to tackle the intertwined issues of tuition and student debt. Unsurprisingly — and in true millennial fashion — that candidate is Bernie Sanders.
Another non-surprise: none of the GOP candidates have provided a substantial plan to remediate climbing tuition rates and staggering student debt. Jeb Bush simply stated that “we do not need the federal government involved in this.” Candidates such as John Kasich have proposed symptom-treatment solutions in the form of revamping online school or vocational training. The rest have largely replied with the tired rationale that students should either suck it up or start flipping burgers — after all, that’s how your father paid for school. Unless your father is George H. W. Bush.
Hillary Clinton is facing quite the political quandary, and not an uncommon one: She needs to appeal to the left in order to take the primary, but she also has to appeal to independents and moderate conservatives during the general election. Thus, on student debt and tuition costs, Clinton has turned toward a moderate, pacifying offer: debt-free college.
However, her action plan is disappointingly unclear, especially in light of her straightforward plans on other topics. It’s too bad, especially considering her newfound youthful, energetic smiles and appearances on millennial favorites such as Saturday Night Live. If she’s trying to win the votes of college students and recent graduates, trying to solve their biggest problem might be a nice place to start. In her plans detailed on her website, Hillary for America, Clinton’s plans to achieve a debt-free higher education by ensuring that everyone “does their part” with parents expected to make a “realistic” contribution. Even with her offer to exclude Pell grant funds from student/parent contribution calculations, Clinton’s plan only accounts for the issue of debt rather than the problem that causes it. By allowing tuition fees to continue to climb, eventually Hillary’s plan must reach a ceiling at which the parties “pitching in” can no longer cover the total cost; after that occurs, students will largely be in the same situation in which they are currently finding themselves. So, put simply, good try.
Conversely, Sanders offers more: not only will higher education be debt-free, but for all public colleges and universities, he also plans on eliminating tuition altogether. The danger with such lofty goals is that they are often exceptionally difficult to achieve, especially with a partisan congress. However, the transparency he provides allows voters to better understand the specific actions which they might seek from this prospective president and from future Congresses. Moreover, most large industrialized nations have already taken these steps and have implemented nearly-identical programs successfully. Though the plan costs $75 billion, Sanders plans to pay for it through a tax on the top 1 percent of the 1 percent — a tax which itself represents an overall increase of only half a percent. Moreover, he plans to reinvest interest on student loans back into education in order to both eliminate the core need for loans as well as disincentivize the federal government to allow current tuition rates to continue. Finally, he plans to require public universities to cease tuition charges, allowing families to use grants to cover housing expenses.
In addition to being far more comprehensive than the Clinton plan, Sanders’s proposal actually treats the cause, rather than alleviating the ugliest realities of its symptoms. Admittedly, Sanders is promising much, and like Obama’s 2008 platform, it is doubtful that he will be able to achieve every piece of his platform, especially considering the current congressional temperature. Rather than pursuing a four-year span of public satisfaction, he pursues a problem-solving strategy. And, in the end, a logical application to a problem, independent of party incentives, has far more propensity for partisan support than a political move designed to garner it. The plan is comprehensive; the plan is logical. The goals are lofty; but truthfully, at least there are real goals at all.
As with any economic layout, Sanders’s plan is not without fault. Tax-based plans always depend on Congress, and currently, the congressional situation is not very dependable at all. However, the clear articulation of his goals, comprehensive and straightforward plan of action and continuing transparency with voters renders him the clear favorite for students looking to support a candidate in favor of solving the tuition crisis.

Bunch of starry eyed, socialist supporting idealists. smh
There is no free anything.  There is only stuff “subsidized” by the taxpayer, and it’s invariably the working poor and the middle-class.  Why?  Because the wealthy — once billed at a higher tax rate — merely
*  lay off enough workers to pay the bill, or
*  move their businesses elsewhere to reduce their bill and/or not pay anything at all,
*  defer their compensation,
*  reduce work hours for their middle-class employees
*  retire early
Then there is the lack of quality that comes with subsidized entitlements.  Public housing turns into drug-addicted ghettoes when you introduce subsidization.
Why would a student from a private school like USC worry about a college tuition plan? Obviously you or your family can afford it, or you have something special about you to gain a scholarship. Maybe you should change your school to a lesser expensive school and donate the balance to someone who can’t afford one? College is not guaranteed, even though both of these candidates in varying degrees to make it that way. So even those who don’t even have children end up paying for other’s kids to attend. Does that seem fair?

Following a quadruple overtime win over No. 7 Arizona on Saturday, the Trojans hit the road to take on crosstown rivals UCLA in the consistently boisterous Pauley Pavilion on Wednesday night, downing the Bruins 89-75 and improving to 15-3 on the season and 4-1 in Pac-12 play.
Considering that the Trojans were sporting a 2-3 road record against teams with a combined 57-20 record, their 12-point victory over the Bruins becomes ever the more impressive.
Bouncing back from a below average performance against Arizona, redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt scored 14 points and pulled down five rebounds.
Along with Reinhardt’s 14, USC registered three double-digit scorers, with sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin and freshman forward Chimezie Metu going for 23 and 21, respectively.
As for the home team Bruins, their night was not as dominant, even with the help of the  rambunctious Pauley Pavilion crowd.
Through the first half of action, USC limited UCLA’s scoring attack to just 30 points on 32.4 percent shooting.
In terms of UCLA’s biggest scorers, Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton, the duo combined for just 19 points after averaging 33.9 combined points per game prior to the match.
Tensions were at an all-time high throughout the first half as freshman Bennie Boatwright was called for a flagrant foul on UCLA’s Prince Ali. After 20 minutes of play, the Bruins and Trojans combined for 40 total fouls, with USC converting 18-23 compared to UCLA’s 9-15.
“[Officiating] was pretty consistent across the board,” junior forward Darion Clark said. “It’s going to be physical night in and night out.”
USC’s biggest lead of the first half came with the clock winding down as they went up by 18 points capped by a Clark layup off of a McLaughlin pass.
At the end of the first half, USC was leading 48-30 after completing 18-39 from the field with 5-1 from beyond the arc, while the Bruins were just 11-34 from the field with just 2-11 from three-point range.
The Trojans dominated the glass with 11 more rebounds than UCLA in the first half thanks to consistent rebounding from six Trojans with four or more rebounds to their credit.
The second half started out with more of the same for the Trojans with 3-pointers on consecutive possessions for Boatwright and McLaughlin.
“Just shooting good shots, kicking it out, making a play for a teammate. Everybody was knocking down shots,” McLaughlin said. “We’ve been growing every game. Every single game from Washington on out we’ve done a better job at closing down the lead when we are up and making sure we have control of the game.”
The Trojans dominance would not be met without stiff competition from the Bruins.
Eventually, UCLA’s ball movement and inside play would cut the Trojans’ once formidable 18-point lead to as little as nine points in the second half due to contributions from Tony Parker and Thomas Welsh, who combined for 43 points.
One area which the Bruins outmatched the Trojans was in ball movement. On the night, USC recorded 14 assists, while UCLA dished out 19 in part from Isaac Hamilton and Bryce Alford.
Although UCLA’s turnover total was just nine, it was USC’s ability to capitalize off those turnovers which really secured a Trojan victory in Westwood. On the night, Southern California scored 11 points off turnovers.
USC’s shooting reigned supreme over UCLA as McLaughlin and sophomore guard Elijah Stewart were dynamite from deep, contributing seven of USC’s 20 three-pointers.
The real story of the night, however, was from USC freshmen phenom Chimezie Metu who set his career high for points with 21, beating his previous record of 16 set against Cal Poly on Dec. 17. Metu was outstanding all night for the Trojans, securing eight rebounds and contributing multiple, high-flying dunks off of 9-of-11 shooting.
“He played a huge game. It was really because of [Metu] why we got out to such a big lead,” McLaughlin said. “We were able to run in transition because of him. He’s a fierce competitor … He’s a freak athlete and the sky’s the limit for him.”
After USC’s commanding 91-75 win over UCLA on the road, the Trojans will head off to Eugene, Oregon, to take on the 13-3 Oregon Ducks in their fifth Pac-12 contest of the season.

Sundays on and around USC’s campus are typically regarded as tranquil, but things are about to drastically change over the next few years.
After a 21-year hiatus, the NFL is finally returning to Los Angeles following Tuesday’s vote by owners to move the Rams from St. Louis back home to the city of Angels. The final approval also gave the San Diego Chargers the option to make the move to L.A. and share the new Inglewood stadium, a $2 billion-plus project that is expected to be ready to use by 2019, with the Rams.
In the meantime, all signs point to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum serving as the temporary home of at least one of these teams, almost certainly the Rams, for the next couple of years before their permanent home is completed.
The Coliseum, which is managed and operated by USC, is scheduled to go through a proposed $270 million in upgrades expected to begin at the start of the 2017 season and would financially benefit from hosting an NFL team or two in order to fund those renovations.
According to Athletic Director Pat Haden, who quarterbacked the Rams back in the late 1970s, USC’s lease with the Coliseum Commission would need to be amended in order to approve a second team because the current lease only allows one NFL team to play in the Coliseum at any given time.
The Coliseum has forever served as the host for the USC football team on Saturdays and occasional Thursdays, and has not been the home to a professional team since 1994.
Nonetheless, USC’s campus, which is less than a half mile south of the Coliseum, needs to get ready for the storm that is going to hit on Sundays beginning in September 2016.
Stadium noise, traffic and tens of thousands of people in the surrounding area are just a few of the inconveniences that will likely take their toll on USC students trying to circumvent campus on NFL game days.
These types of logistical challenges are going to be present regardless of where the team(s) play in L.A., but in this case, it’s going to directly impact student life at USC in the fall.
While most students set aside their academics for USC home games and renowned tailgates on campus, Sundays are a whole different animal.
At least for the time that I’ve attended USC, many students have typically used Sundays as a day to catch up on their studies, whether it be individually or by meeting with fellow students on campus to collaborate.
Yes, students now have the option of rolling out of bed, walking less than a mile and getting a double dose of football in person on some weekends, but it could potentially be disruptive to others who have different priorities.
Though it’s just temporary, the Coliseum very well might be the closest NFL-College Football shared stadium to a college campus so it’s just important that steps are taken to address any possible issues concerning the community that may arise. That’s because for USC, the pros absolutely outweigh the cons in the Coliseum functioning as a temporary home site.
Angelenos have been waiting more than two decades to see professional football return to their city and it’s USC that is going to have the honor of putting its stamp on the initial stages of what’s just the beginning of a new era for the NFL in L.A. It doesn’t hurt at all that USC Athletics will also be bringing in a little extra cash to help finance the new look of the Coliseum.
I will have already graduated by the time fans start to head down to Exposition Park to watch the Rams and perhaps, the Chargers, play at the Coliseum, but I’m hoping that USC takes measures to ensure that the big business that the NFL carries along with it doesn’t undermine the undergraduate experience for students.

The men’s tennis team is coming off a successful 2015 season in which it spent several weeks as the No. 1 ranked team in the nation and reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.
USC men have won five of the last seven national titles and are sure to be serious competitors again this season. The 2016 team is anchored by junior Nick Crystal and senior Max de Vroome, both key contributors to last season’s team with records of 29-6 and 28-8, respectively. In addition, Tanner Smith, son of head coach Peter Smith, and Connor Farren are returning to the Trojans, both seeing action last season with the team.
Although the 2015 team graduated four of its top six players, it is bringing in the third-ranked recruiting class in the nation. Logan Smith and Jake DeVine are the two members of the class, both ranked in the preseason top 100 and are expected to have an immediate impact.
Smith, a five time Pac-12 and two time national coach of the year, returns for his 14th season as head coach. He has led the team to five national titles and under him they have finished ranked top 10 in the final rankings the last nine years in a row.
The women’s team had an even more impressive showing, losing only two matches all season on the way to an appearance in the NCAA semifinals and are looking to improve upon that in the upcoming season.
They are looking to win their first national title since 1985 and enter the preseason ranked second in the nation, behind only defending national champions Vanderbilt, a team the Trojans defeated last season at Marks Stadium. Head coach Richard Gallien returns to USC for his 21st season, leading the Trojans to 18 straight finishes in the top 20, collecting five Pac-12 coach of the year awards along the way.
After only graduating two of their top six players, they are led by senior Giuliana Olmos and sophomores Gabby Smith and Madison Westby. Olmos had a successful offseason in which she competed in several professional ITF Futures tournaments, collecting three titles and an additional appearance in the semifinals.
In addition to the returners, they are adding freshmen Rianna Valdes and Jessica Failla, both ranked inside the top 80 nationally in the preseason rankings. Failla is coming off a successful winter season, where she was able to win the USTA under-18 National Winter Championship. This is shaping up to be an exciting season, with three additional Pac-12 teams ranked in the top 10.
The Women of Troy begin their season Jan. 20 at 1:30 p.m. against UC Santa Barbara at Marks Stadium.

The track and field team looks to improve on its strong 2015 season that saw the men’s team place fifth in the NCAA Championships, while the women finished seventh.
These top-ten finishes were largely due to the 24 athletes who earned All-American honors, seventeen of whom will be returning for the 2016 season.
Among them is sophomore Adoree’ Jackson, whose long jumps secured titles at the USC-UCLA meet and the Pac-12 championships. Marquis Morris is also returning after his All-American 2015 season that saw him win the conference’s 110m HH. The men’s team has a solid throwing roster, which includes All-American Nick Ponzio as well as Matt Katnik. Ponzio set a school shot put record for freshmen, while Katnik won the California state shot put title. Conor McCullough, the 2015 NCAA champion hammer thrower, will also be returning for the Trojans after being granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA.
The women’s team can count on returnees like Alexis Faulknor who not only set PRs in 100m and 200m races but also won the Pac-12 long jump title. Returning senior Tera Novy had an outstanding 2015 season, setting the USC discus throw record, placing fourth in the NCAA championships and second in the Pac-12 championships. The women’s team also boasts hurdler Dior Hall, who placed third in the 2015 NCAA Championships with a world junior record time and won the Pac-12 100m HH crown.
Among those not returning is sprinter Andre De Grasse, who accepted a pro contract after his breakout 2015 season. To help fill those shoes, USC brought in a very strong recruiting class.
On the women’s team, freshman Jasmyne Graham, the 2015 Girls Gatorade Track Athlete of the Year, will headline the hurdle events, while runner Mikaela Smith, the 2013 and 2014 California State Champion, is expected to lead the 800m run.
The men’s team includes redshirt freshman sprinter Zyaire Clemes, who placed second at the New Balance Outdoor Nationals 400m event in his senior year of high school. He also boasts a Junior Olympic title in the 400m race.
This exciting Track and Field season will kick off with indoor competitions from mid-January until mid-March, at which point the outdoor events will commence until the season’s end in late June. Though some coaches regard the indoor contests as a chance to practice, USC’s track and field director Caryl Smith Gilbert, who will be entering her third season at USC, does not adhere to that state-of-mind. She expects her athletes to perform to their fullest potential throughout the entire track and field season. This is evidenced by the two indoor MPSF championships the Women of Troy have claimed in the 2014 and 2015 seasons.
The 2016 Track and Field season kicks off Jan. 16 at the University of Washington’s Dempsey Indoor Center for the UW Indoor Preview. USC will send 22 women and 16 men to Seattle in hopes of besting their solid 2015 showing. Last season, the Trojans recorded four wins (women’s 200m and 400m races, men’s 400m, women’s triple jump), seven personal records (60m: Alexis Faulknor, Destinee Brown; 60m HH: Melia Cox; 200m: BeeJay Lee; 400m: Jaide Stepter, Ricky Morgan; 800m: Robert Ford) and one USC event record (Robert Ford’s 800m 1:52.70 beat the standing record of 1:53.9, set in 1968 by Carl Trentadue).

Celebrity advocacy was the topic of debate Wednesday when the USC Center on Public Diplomacy gathered former diplomats and professors together to discuss Diana, Princess of Wales, as a case study for advocacy not just on behalf of royals or states, but on behalf of individuals as well.
The panel consisted of Patrick Jephson, Princess Diana’s former Chief of Staff, Brett Bruen, former U.S. Diplomat and Director of Global Engagement at the White House and Bill Beaman, adjunct professor of Public Communications and a founding partner of OnPoint Strategies. The discussion was moderated by Mary Murphy, a journalist and senior lecturer in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Diana, often known as “Princess Diana,” was known for her public appearances on behalf of the royal family and for her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales, which ended in an unprecedented divorce in 1996. The princess died in a car crash in Paris in 1997.
Bruen started the discussion with a statement of purpose, saying the message that attendees should take away is finding your story.
“Define what it is you need [a] personal brand for,” Bruen said. “There ought to be a goal because that ought to inform everything else what you do.”
Jephson then took over the discussion by talking about his work with Diana and the principles that guided his actions to create Diana’s personal brand. He described her as a princess that could stand on her own despite a precedent that members of the Royal Family were “decorative.” He described Diana as not merely Britain’s princess, but “the world’s princess,” and as her chief of staff he made an effort to present Diana as such.
“She was authentic, she was genuine,” Jephson said. “The compassion you saw her give to a refugee, a leper, a victim of drug abuse, of domestic violence, somebody living with AIDS — all these people spoke a language that was international. It was the language of compassion and need.”
Beaman then described the need for authenticity in messaging  and noted Diana’s own authenticity and “forgivability.” As Jephson put it, when among those who had lived a rough life, Diana saw herself as “one of them.”
Bringing up examples of “celebrity diplomats” like Angelina Jolie and Emma Watson, Murphy then asked the other panelists for their take on the role of celebrity personas to further diplomacy.
Bruen argued that celebrities tend to make poor advocates due to their lack of knowledge or effectiveness in their philanthropic efforts.
“If you want to generate the good will, the forgivability, you have to show impact. And so few celebrities are able to do that,” Bruen said. “Largely it is because their involvement is shaped not so much through the optic of ‘what do I want this initiative to achieve?’, but ‘what do I want to achieve?’”
Jephson noted the tendency for celebrities to engage in philanthropy only for publicity but also acknowledged that if done properly, celebrity philanthropy can lead to good. “If [Diana] felt rewarded” for [her philanthropic work] then she would do more of it,” he said.
When Jephson took his position working on Diana’s brand the princess gave him some words that would guide his work there: “Let’s go conquer the world with love.”

For Dieuwertje “DJ” Kast, ’11, who was listed in Forbes fifth “30 Under 30” list for her work in STEM education, her recognition is just the latest development of her ongoing successes at USC and the surrounding community. A self-proclaimed “Trojan for life,” Kast holds a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees from USC, but her journey as a member of the Trojan Family started earlier. Her, father, Martin Kast, is a professor at the Keck School of Medicine  of USC, and she grew up learning about his Human Papilomavirus and cervical cancer research.
“I was definitely inspired to be in STEM because of my dad,” Kast said, “He was very happy when I applied to USC as a freshman biology major. It’s because of [my family], and [it’s] because of all of the other STEM education mentors I’ve had throughout the years that I’ve been able to get this successful.”
USC alumni were among many featured in Forbes’ list, acknowledging influential teens and 20-something’s from 20 different fields. Starting with 15,000 nominees, only 600 young visionaries made the “30 Under 30 Class of 2016.” Out of those who made the final cut, whom Forbes calls “Today’s Brightest Young Stars And The Future Leaders Of Everything,” at least 11 are USC alumni. USC boasts finalists from seven categories, from games to venture capital.
Now STEM Programs Manager for USC’s Joint Educational Program, Kast attended JEP’s summer science program at Catalina Island in high school. She went on to volunteer with JEP during her time as an undergraduate and found her home there in science education.
“Being a science major and starting in research science academia, I never really felt like I fit in,” Kast said. “I started doing a lot more work with the community right outside USC and I found that I truly loved that more. I felt that really was my calling.”
Since beginning at JEP, Kast said, she has become their  “poster child” for STEM education. Not only does she coordinate the STEM component of the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a comprehensive, seven-year college preparatory program for low-income youth, but she also introduces elementary school kids in the community to the world of science with educational programs like Wonderkids and the Young Scientist Program, which both work on the sciences with local schools in Los Angeles.
“There’s usually not a lot of science in the lower grades,” Kast said. “We choose different fields of science, we do really hands-on science activities to introduce that particular field, and at the end of that unit we actually get a scientist in that field that comes in and talks. Kids so young love to ask questions and they can ask them to a real scientist.”
Kast also instructs USC undergraduates in volunteer science education. In all she does, from running these programs to wearing science-themed dresses in class, Kast hopes to inspire a love for science.
“My kids know that I really like science, and I hope to inspire them to like science,” Kast said. I want them to see how fun science can be. Even if they don’t go into science, I want the to at least appreciate what it can do.”
Kast’s advice for USC students and aspiring professionals is to be your authentic self and follow your passions. Although she won recognition for science, like many of the others on the list, Kast wears many hats and she encourages others to do the same.
“Get experience in what you love,” Kast said. “There are lots of ways to combine multiple loves, especially in science. Try to get experiences in all sorts of fields. Once you do know what you really like find those mentors. Find people that are doing what you like. Reach out.”

Moriah Mulroe has success down to a science.
Mulroe, a senior majoring in biochemistry and geology, joined a distinguished group by becoming a recipient of the 2016 Marshall Scholarship.
The Marshall Scholarship is an extremely competitive scholarship provided to high achieving American scholars in order to finance graduate studies in the United Kingdom. Forty students are awarded the scholarship each year.
Mulroe, a Mork Scholar, knew of her passion for chemistry when she came to USC, but it wasn’t until later that she discovered her love of geology.
“Before college, I used to love reading about chemistry, — I had a great chemistry course in high school, [and] started checking out all the books in the library. The typical story,” Mulroe said. “I found geology once I got to college actually. Didn’t know I was interested in it until I started attending seminars, talked to some professors and realized I really liked geochemistry. So then I kind of found my niche by combining the majors.”
Mulroe has been an active student throughout her college career. She attributes the direction she has taken in her studies to her research on analyzing organic atmospheric acids and her impactful discussions with professors she has worked under like Hanna Reisler, the Lloyd Armstrong Jr. Chair in Science and Engineering and professor of chemistry at USC.
While Mulroe hasn’t had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad during her undergraduate studies at USC, she did participate in Problems Without Passports. PWP is a summer program that combines problem-based research with study in a foreign country. Mulroe studied the biology of tropical disease at Oxford University through PWP. This steered her to write her research proposal on health care after natural disasters, which embodied both of her majors.
Katie Calvert, associate director of USC’s Academic Honors and Fellowships, originally presented the prospect of the Marshall Scholarship to Mulroe, but she said she was surprised to receive it.
“I was definitely shocked,” Mulroe said. “It’s something I tried very hard on the application and definitely something I really wanted, but also something I didn’t expect to receive”
Mulroe will be achieving her graduate studies at Queen Mary University of London thanks to the Marshall Scholarship. The masters course she will be studying solely focuses on freshwater management. This includes, but is not limited to, looking at modeling flooding, flood control, hurricane, tsunamis and the remediation of water systems. Mulroe looks forward to this opportunity and truly enjoys what she will be studying.
“It’s a cool area to work in because it’s a lot of science, but still a humanity side to it. I like to say it’s science but you know what purpose you’re serving,” Mulroe said.
Mulroe isn’t sure yet what the future holds after graduate school. She would love to have a job where she can work with natural disaster management, either in a research position or at a non-governmental organization or governmental position.
“I’m always up for new adventures,” Mulroe said.
Mulroe was one of two recipients of the scholarship from USC. The other scholarship recipient is alumna Anu Ramchandran of the class of 2013. Ramchandran will conduct research at the London School in the Public Health in Humanitarian Crisis Group. Mulroe and Ramchandran are two of 11 Trojans to receive this award since 1969.

USC apologized on Tuesday for asking questions about students’ sexual history in a mandatory sexual assault training course. The University received backlash after the online publication Campus Reform released details of the questionnaire on its website, prompting the apology and removal of questions from the training.
The questions, which some people deemed invasive, asked students how many times they had sex in the past three months, as well as how many sexual partners they have had and whether or not they use a condom.
“USC apologizes for any offense or discomfort caused by optional questions included as part of a mandatory online training for students on sexual consent, misconduct and other important issues,” senior vice president for administration Todd Dickey said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
The questions also were removed from the training course Tuesday.
Although the questionnaire, part of a larger sexual assault training course meant to teach students about safe sex and comply with Title IX regulations, is mandatory — students cannot register for spring classes until they have successfully completed the course — the questions about students’ sexual history are optional, with a “No Comment” option available. The survey is anonymous; students’ identities are not tied with their answers to the questions.
Campus Clarity, which produces the training for USC, clarified that the material was used in Title IX training programs at more than 500 colleges and universities across the country. The training is required for all university freshmen under the Campus Save Act, which came into effect last year.

Seniors who are looking to land a full-time opportunity after graduation, meet HireTeamMate, Inc., a virtual job recruiter that was co-founded by alumnus Shuo Wang.
In March 2015, Wang received an invitation from co-worker Steven Jiang to create a startup in the Bay Area. Both Wang and Jiang had been working at Samsung as software engineers until they decided to collaborate and build an automated recruitment site.
“HireTeamMate is not LinkedIn or AngelList — it is a unique hiring platform for job referral,” Wang said. “Using big data and artificial technology, we put the recruiter on the cloud and help employers save precious time and money.”
Before candidates are even passed on to the hiring team, HireTeamMate filters out unqualified applicants. This process eliminates the need for in-house recruiters and essentially decentralizes the traditional recruiting system.
Director of Media Relations Hannah Tran also shared that the company just released a new recruiting software on New Year’s Day.
“Our new release represents the first peer-to-peer hiring platform of its kind,” Tran said. “It allows job seekers to add their profiles to a data hub of existing job listings, and it especially helps those who are looking for jobs in the startup community.”
The new version will include a Startup Hub, which provides a product discovery blog as well as reviews of every startup’s team. This development is intended to improve job relevancy and lead to quicker, more efficient hires.
Jay Hasegawa, a senior majoring in economics, is eager to try out HireTeamMate because of its direct access to employers and hiring teams.
“With graduation approaching, I want to find something that matches the experiences and skills I’ve developed at USC,” Hasegawa said. “HireTeamMate seems like a very helpful and convenient resource because it is available for people who are seeking a variety of positions.”
Since the company’s launch, HireTeamMate has received 72,000 applicants and almost 13,000 resumes have been reviewed by hiring companies. Even more impressive is the fact that 86 percent of applicants who secure on-site interviews have been hired afterwards.
Wang attributes this success rate to HireTeamMate’s algorithms and the way it has transformed recruiting.
“Think of HireTeamMate as the Uber for hiring,” Wang said. “Employers post job positions, hiring teams provide referrals, and talent scouts discover top candidates — and we simplify and accelerate the recruitment process.”
As the CTO of the company, Wang’s long-term goal is to turn HireTeamMate into a virtual recruiter that thinks like a human and provides hiring solutions for not only startups but also big firms. His advice for college entrepreneurs to reach their goals is to concentrate on the big picture.
“Try to solve the real problems in your life,” Wang said. “Don’t focus on making money or becoming successful in the short-term.”
