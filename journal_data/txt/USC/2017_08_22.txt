The city of Los Angeles offers various avenues for people who are lucky enough to experience a taste of all it has to offer. Moreover, the City of Angels is home to many inspiring murals, synthesizing a culture of purposeful design to build the city’s signature style. Los Angeles’ murals not only capture the strong voices of the city, but also inspire Angelenos to seize the beauty of a moment and celebrate the art that brings communities together.
Ride along the Red Line
Curious? Need some inspiration? Desperate for a break from a mundane Monday? Take an afternoon off to experience all the beauty Los Angeles has in store. Along the L.A. Metro Red Line are hundreds of murals that correspond to different neighborhoods. According to Discover Los Angeles’ website, they are Downtown, NoHo and Hollywood.
Golden Downtown: The Treasure Chest
Starting in the heart of Los Angeles, Downtown offers an abundant view of the L.A. art scene, from classic murals such as Eloy Torres’ “The Pope of Broadway” to more modern works like “California Dreamscape.” The best part is that some of these murals, such as “Under The Living Rock,” live right by the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Anyone making a day of discovering the city’s hidden gems definitely should not miss it. 
 
Classic Hollywood: Timeless Art and Entertainment
 
Next on the Red Line is not-so-humble Hollywood, home to the most well-known figures in entertainment and movies. The “glamorous” city is glorified for many reasons, including diverse foods and desserts, along with murals of celebrities that bring back the Gatsby-esque feel of Classic Hollywood. 
The “Hollywood Jazz” mural captures an era of innovation, culture and music that brought life to the city. Hollywood is also home to a Persian dessert store called Mashti Malone. Grab a mashti (Persian ice cream sandwich) and take a walk with a buddy along Hollywood Boulevard. While you’re at it, take a break at the Disney Store, catch a quick flick at El Capitan Theatre and take a picture with the stars of your favorite celebrities. You can stop by the creative costume stores and try on some wigs while you’re at it. 
Noho District: Casual and Carefree
Last on the Red Line is North Hollywood, or NoHo, known for its casual vibe and picturesque setting. Following Vineland Avenue, the journey will take you to murals of all colors, cultures and types. NoHo has fine coffee shops and cafes, so grab a latte and take a stroll on Vineland and Cahuenga avenues. If you have a bike, you can ride along the main street and make the murals into a live slideshow.
LA: “City of Angels” or “City of Art”?
Take a trip to Union Station to see the original depictions of the “City of Angels” through the well-Instagrammed “Ram’khastra” which translates to “Angel of Rarefied Air,” according to the L.A. Metro.  If you’ve seen pictures of people standing in front of murals to show their wings, this is your chance to strike a pose (preferably candid, because looking into cameras is outdated). 
Wonders of Wilshire Blvd: “Festival of Masks Parade”
The Festival of Masks Parade used to draw hundreds of spectators who would crowd Wilshire Boulevard. By celebrating  African and Korean heritage, among others, the Festival of Masks Parade united diverse groups of people in the Wilshire neighborhood. All the different cultures had their own masks that represented their cultural identity. This event inspired a mural that is now etched onto the walls of Wilshire Boulevard with pride. As people pass by every day, it helps remind them that Los Angeles embodies acceptance, variety, mutual appreciation and unity.
Aesthetics of Neon Art: Pershing Square
Last but not least, make sure to visit Pershing Square for riveting neon art, which is unique for its modern and simplistic approach. The futuristic art is blended into the architecture and allows for viewers to enter another dimension — one that combines light, angle and shape to create an ephemeral, elusive beauty.
 
As Angelenos, we’re always occupied with tasks that cause us to lose sight of what matters in life. It’s important to harness your creative energy and spark some inspiration. Take a casual Monday or relaxing weekend night off and tour the city’s artistic gems. Grab a buddy and take them mural-spotting for the day. You’ll end up with memories, pictures and, best of all, a different perspective.

I should be really thrilled right now. I should be ecstatic. I should be bragging to all of my friends who find themselves in a city other than Los Angeles this fall. 
This upcoming season of Angeleno sports, both pro and collegiate, is anticipated to be one of the most eventful in recent memory. A pair of (admittedly mediocre) professional football teams will battle for relevancy and a fanbase this fall. The Los Angeles Angels are thanking the heavens for the creation of the second wildcard spot. The UCLA Bruins will be led by the Rosen one. And in the midst of it all this fall, the reign of Lonzo-mania will commence at Staples Center. 
At the center of what will surely be a hectic time for Los Angeles sports are two teams near to my heart, who I fear may be riding hype trains toward derailment: The USC football squad and the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Both of these teams currently bear very high championship expectations. They each certainly have compelling elements that would lead many to anticipate successful seasons. And with both teams currently riding abnormally long title droughts, this high bar should be expected from championship-hungry fanbases. 
It’s been 29 years since the Dodgers last hoisted the Commissioner’s Trophy. And while USC is the reigning Rose Bowl champion, it’s no secret that the national title trophy is the most coveted hardware within the confines of Heritage Hall — and the Trojans haven’t brought it home since 2004. Even that title was technically stripped after the Reggie Bush scandal. 
I’d love to jump on the hype train for both the Dodgers and the Trojans — really. Away from the journalistic setting, I’d love to boast to my friends about the whooping USC has in line for Alabama during next season’s College Football Playoff. However, I’m hesitant to board the train; I’m a victim of sports heartbreak, especially when it comes to my beloved teams underperforming. 
When USC kicker Matt Boermeester’s 46-yard field goal split the uprights this past January against Penn State, the Trojans clinched their record-25th Rose Bowl Trophy. USC is the undisputed historical champion of the Grandaddy of Them All, but it’s a 12th national championship trophy that Trojan nation has been longing for for the past 13 years. 
The Trojans enter the 2017 regular season with a No. 4 preseason ranking from the opening AP Top 25 Poll. Led by all-world redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, USC is projected by many to clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff behind a Heisman-caliber signal caller. 
Of course, the hype train is always very real at USC, no matter the outcome of the prior season. Coming off a Rose Bowl victory, it’s apparent that many following the program are calling 2017 a national championship or bust type of campaign. As promising as the team looks, I can’t look past the last time USC had this sort of anticipation: the tumultuous 2012 season. 
The Trojans entered 2012 ranked No. 1 nationally, led by star quarterback Matt Barkley — they would go on to finish that season unranked after an underwhelming 7-6 regular season campaign. It was the first time since 1964 that a team opened a season No. 1, but failed to be ranked by the end of the year. 
Cases like the 2012 season make me hesitant to snag College Football Playoff tickets to watch my dear Trojans — well, some financial barriers may also contribute to my hesitancy. 
Now, about those Dodgers, the boys in blue who captivated the baseball world for an entire summer. Dave Roberts’ team is another that has a hype train I am dying to board, but cannot due to prior experiences. 
The Dodgers’ 43-7 run over a 50-game span this summer was the winningest 50-game stretch in Major League since 1912. Los Angeles (87-35) currently holds a monstrous 20-game lead over Colorado (68-56) in the NL West standings. Even more satisfying for Dodgers fans: Los Angeles has a 39-game lead on the San Francisco Giants (50-76). Glorious. 
Once again, I’d love to punch my ticket to the World Series this early. The magic at Chavez Ravine is undeniable right now, that’s indisputable. Hasn’t the 3-run bottom of the ninth walk-off become conventional for this Dodger team? Don’t you just expect them to make a dramatic comeback every single night? The magical moments narrated by Joe Davis this season have captivated — and enlarged — the Dodgers’ fanbase. Just the other night my roommate was guaranteeing me a World Series title from the Dodgers. 
But I fear that I’ve watched too much baseball, endured too much heartbreak, to join him in his optimistic fandom. 
I remember the 2013 season and the 42-8 run the Dodgers underwent during the summer of the Puig. That Dodgers team was a freight train, which included a dominant Clayton Kershaw and fresh-faced Yasiel Puig. However, that mighty train was derailed by an un-hittable Michael Wacha and the Cardinals in the NLCS.
Don’t get me started about those 2008 and 2009 Dodger teams that met their demise against the Phillies in the NLCS in consecutive seasons. Those series have forever tainted my appreciation of Jonathan Broxton as a Dodgers closer. 
Fandom is an interesting thing, isn’t it? Your experience of the sports world starts off very subjective: following your team from your town, following your favorite player. But the more you divulge into its depths, the more you gain an objectivity: you take into account other division races, other teams, other players, the league as a whole. You slowly but surely begin to realize where your respective team stands in the food chain; you also gain a broader scope on the ultimate irrelevance the regular season. You realize there is a postseason, and that’s where the dream-making or heart-breaking ultimately takes place. 
How I long for the simple days. When my team was going to win the title every year. When the quarterback of my team was going to win the Heisman every year. When my team was going to end their nearly three-decade long championship drought. 
So it’s probably best to not corrupt my roommate’s optimism with the complexities and disappointments of devout sports fanaticism.

The USC football team has very high expectations for the upcoming season, as evidenced by its No. 4 ranking in the coaches poll. Everyone knows the program is one of the best in the country, but here’s what you might have missed over summer break:
Recruiting
The Trojans’ 2018 recruiting class is currently ranked 18th by 247sports.com. It’s headlined by linebacker Palaie Gaoteote, the lone five-star commit USC currently has in its 2018 class.
The Trojans were stung by the loss of prospect Matt Corral, a five-star quarterback in the class of 2018. Corral decommitted from USC in late June and is currently committed to the University of Florida.
The pain of losing Corral was replaced with joy when the University landed J.T. Daniels — 247Sports’ top-ranked quarterback in the class of 2019 — in July. The junior quarterback from Mater Dei High School chose the Trojans over other top-flight programs Alabama and Michigan, as well as rival Stanford.
Head coach Clay Helton also secured a commitment from 247Sports’ top-ranked 2018 center, four-star recruit Justin Dedich, in June.
Key Losses
The Trojans will have to replace 11 starters from last year’s squad, including five players taken in the NFL Draft. The most significant loss is that of cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who, in addition to setting a school record for career kick return touchdowns with eight, won the 2016 Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back and was a productive receiver in his time on campus. 
Jackson was drafted 18th overall by the Tennessee Titans and has already flashed his incredible athletic ability as a returner. He is working to make his way into the starting lineup at cornerback.
Quarterback Sam Darnold loses top wide receivers Juju Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers, who were reliable targets last season. Smith-Schuster was drafted 62nd overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers, who add to their abundance of talented receivers. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the rookie has sustained a number of injuries at camp, the most recent being an apparent knee injury earlier this week. Rogers signed with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent.
In addition, USC will have to replace three starters on the offensive line, including right tackle Zach Banner. Banner was drafted in the fourth round by the Indianapolis Colts, and is currently a back-up on their line.
Kicker Matt Boermeester, who kicked the game-winning field goal in the Rose Bowl, was dismissed from the University in July for a student code of conduct violation. Michael Brown and walk-on Chase McGrath are in a fierce battle for the starting spot. The position has been a cause for concern as fall camp has progressed, and Helton has said that the competition could continue into the regular season.
Watch Lists
USC has players on just about every pre-season award watch list. Darnold is being tracked as a Maxwell and O’Brien award candidate, which are awarded to the best player and best quarterback, respectively. Darnold is also a preseason pick for the Heisman Award.
Defensive back Iman Marshall will try to follow in Jackson’s footsteps as a Thorpe Award winner. He will also be a contender for the Bednarik and Nagurski Awards for best defender.
Porter Gustin is on the watch lists for the Bednarik Award, as well as the Butkus Award for best linebacker. Ronald Jones is a possible recipient of the Doak Walker Award for best running back, while Helton is a preseason contender for the Dodd Trophy for best coach.
Other Notes
Freshman linebacker Tayler Katoa will miss the season after tearing a knee ligament during spring practices. According to ESPN, Katoa’s injury required surgery and will keep him sidelined for a total of nine months.
Over the offseason, offensive coordinator Tee Martin designed an app that quizzes players on team concepts such as formations and receiving routes. A Los Angeles Times article detailed how coaches can check how long players are on the app, as well as their results. 
The app was created as part of a program-wide effort to reduce mental mistakes. If the system is successful, the Trojans should improve on a season in which they ranked 113th in the nation in penalties per game and 114th in penalty yardage.

Located in the heart of Koreatown and drawing inspiration from the neighborhood’s vibrant scene, the KX Festival brought the community together in a celebration of Asian American culture. With live music, food, shopping and entertainment, the festival transformed MacArthur Park for two free days of fun. 
The Levitt Pavilion stage hosted myriad performers, primarily of Asian American heritage, who brought everything from acoustic to K-pop to the stage throughout the day. Saturday was dedicated to hip-hop and the stage was commanded by up-and-coming local artists. The day’s headliner was Sammy Sam, a former member of the hip-hop group Public Enemy who publicly showcased his culture and support for the Korean community at the KX Festival. 
Sunday marked a transition with more inclusive acts for audiences of all ages, such as acoustic acts, dance performances, traditional Korean drummers and fan dancers and YouTube musicians. USC alumnus Leo Xia made an appearance, joining the ranks of Fuzzzy Musik and Megan Lee. Headliner Clara C closed out the festival on Sunday evening with a tribute to her Korean heritage. 
“We want to create a platform for Asian American artists because to perform as an Asian American you usually have to be big-name,” festival co-founder and event director Joe Park said. “Here, we wanted to create the same environment with food, being outdoors in a park and a stage.” 
Aside from the music stage, visitors were able to enjoy a delectable lineup of food vendors and food trucks with roots in Koreatown: Seoul Sausage, Jogasaki Sushi Burrito, Very Very Rice Cake Studios, Boo’s Korean-style Philly Cheesesteaks and more. Vendors also had the opportunity to present their best dish to a panel of VIP judges  in the KX / LA Weekly Food Contest to be named “Best Eatery” and win a feature in the publication.
The festival also designated a tent area selling goods from local, Korean-owned clothing and cosmetics companies. HIN Events, an automotive events producer based in Southern California, hosted a car show with a pop-up model lounge, prizes, photo booths and exclusive premiums for automotive enthusiasts on Saturday.
KX Festival co-founder David Choi credits their many community partnerships — including those with Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and David Ryu, LA Weekly and YTN News — as catalysts to the event’s success. Through the joint efforts of the festival’s staff of volunteers and the generosity of performers who accepted less than their usual booking rates, the festival was free to the public and open to all ages. 
This year marks the festival’s first time appearing as a festival with food and additional vendors, having previously only hosted indvidual concerts. In the future, Park hopes to return in the future and envisions the  KX Festival as an affordable, family-friendly alternative to existing cultural events in the Korean community  such as KCON, whose tickets can cost hundreds of dollars. . 
Choi and Park started the KX Festival to create a space for younger generations to immerse themselves in modern Korean American culture, given that existing festivals are catered toward older generations. They also share a commitment to sparking the careers of Asian American artists who otherwise lack the resources and encouragement. 
“KX stands for Kore-Angeleno, K-Town or Korean exchange,” Park said. “We wanted to exchange Korean and American cultures and create a diversity of American-born Asians.”

This past Monday marked two momentous events: the official start of the University’s 2017 Fall semester and the first time a total solar eclipse has passed across the United States in 38 years. 
From 9 to 11:45 a.m., the city of Los Angeles was able to see a partial eclipse with a 62 percent coverage of the sun. Even though the city was outside the path of totality — the small, 70 mile-wide path across the United States where the moon passes completely in front of the sun — Los Angeles hosted dozens of events for the public to experience what many have dubbed the “Great American Eclipse.” 
On the University campus, the 10:20 a.m. eclipse apex cut right into some of the new semester’s first morning classes. Many professors took time out of their classes to allow students to view the partial eclipse visible from campus outside classroom windows. 
“Our professor let us take a break to see the eclipse,” said Michael Tawata, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said. “The coolest part was probably the pinhole projection.” 
Thousands of students stood next to brick buildings and crowded underneath Tommy Trojan’s shadow, with boxes of free eclipse glasses handed out to students and telescopes set up near the statue for those wishing to view the spectacle. 
A variety of viewing parties were hosted in and around Los Angeles, most notably the city’s famous science centers including the Griffith Observatory, the California Science Center and the Mountt. Wilson Observatory, among others. These events gave out free eclipse viewing glasses and had telescopes on-hand for public use. The California Science Center in particular had attending specialists including astrophysicists and representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to answer any questions the public might have about the eclipse. NASA also hosted a full-day livestream of the eclipse on their website. 
Kevin Frank, the informal STEM education supervisor from JPL, was there at the California Science Center teaching the public about the solar eclipse. With his own wooden pinhole eclipse viewer on a table covered with kid-friendly diagrams and designs, Frank taught the crowd of children about the day’s eclipse, how it was formed and how it was connected to the solar system.
“This is a great day to come out to sScience mMuseums,” Frank said. “Today, you get to put on the glasses and look through a pinhole camera, and you get to understand the science behind how the solar system works.”
Social media platforms were flooded with all things eclipse, including images of pets wearing eclipse glasses, President Donald Trump squinting up at the sun without wearing eclipse glasses and views of the total eclipse’s shadow passing over an airplane during the flight. 
Monday’s eclipse was the last total eclipse crossing the United States for the next seven years and the next one is expected to cut across just a fraction of the states compared to this one. During the previous total eclipse in 1979, almost 38 years ago, ABC News hosted a televised eclipse viewing narrated by their host Frank Reynolds.
“Not until August 21, 2017 will another eclipse be visible from North America. That’s 38 years from now,” Reynolds said when the eclipse passed. “May the shadow of the moon fall on a world at peace.” 
Just hours after its conclusion, the entire eclipse will be available for the public to relive in “Eclipse Over America,” an hour-long documentary recounting the events of Aug. 21 produced by the science series, NOVA. The TV feature will include footage from public television stations in cities who were bathed in the swatch of the eclipse.

Your campaign ran a platform of increased campus security, including sexual assault prevention and active shooter training; improved outreach toward transfer students, spring admits and first-generation students; and partnerships with the Los Angeles Metro. Do you have a priority on which you plan to focus on first? 
A — Active shooter training and sexual assault prevention are the two we plan to prioritize because those two are a little more difficult just in the realm of the time they take to accomplish. We try to start on the more difficult projects sooner, because we’ve found in the past that if you try and start on lofty goals later in the year you just kind of run out of time, and unfortunately the year does fly quickly. Also, both of these goals, between sexual assault and active shooter training, we do rely on other people to have them accomplished. And so we try to allot as much time as possible to allow that process to continue. 
Do you foresee any challenges in executing these goals? 
A — It’s just a matter of when they’ll be executed because there’s different types of projects. Obviously there’s some that we can complete on our own and some that we sort of have to rely on other people for, and so active shooter training and sexual assault prevention are two perfect examples of that, because we can put in all the groundwork for active shooter training but we still need DPS’s assistance to actually have it implemented and become a mandatory policy.
The degree of USG’s accessibility was a hot topic last semester — do you plan to make any changes in order to address or improve this?
A — This is something that I think we talk about all the time, and I think we’re actually looking to address it in all branches, whether that’s funding, to our communications team, and even to our advocacy efforts. One challenge that we had in the past, or at least last year, was that we didn’t have a website essentially all year. And so we had a lot of different tools that we planned on implementing that couldn’t actually be used because we didn’t have a website. And then we have some other ideas to start some mini-campaigns or platforms to kind of just make the student body more aware of what USG is doing. An example of an idea we’ve been throwing around is something called Two-Minute Tuesday, where we post at two-minute video weekly that allows the students to see what’s happened in the realm of student government, or what advocacy has been done on their behalf, or what programs are available to them that week or in the coming week. That’s kind of an idea that came from discussing with other student leaders across the country at different schools, and so that’s something we’re super excited about. But I’d say it’s kind of a united front to increase the accessibility and transparency of our organization and all that we’re doing. 
Many people aren’t familiar with your roles. Are you two working together or independently to address these issues, and who are you working with?
A — Morgan and I work as a team pretty much on everything. We do have little nuances that I think we kind of take on independently but generally speaking I think we are always a united front in the realm of how we are working and leading the organization and how we’re conveying that externally as well. When it comes to who we work with — USG is a team effort and every single member of our organization is somebody that is utilized and an essential part of our success … We also really do rely on our campus partners, because there’s so many great people that we have to work with and I think part of what Morgan and I are working to do is really be that bridge to the rest of our organization. Because we really do believe we have the experts in pretty much every field, and so we don’t need to have all the answers ourselves. But one thing that we may have access to that other students may not have is the relationships with various administrators or whether that’s connecting to other students leaders. That’s something that we definitely try to do as much as we can.
What are you most excited for as the new school year nears its start? 
A — I think that one’s a pretty easy answer for us, because we have a really unique opportunity this year to be leading a student body at a campus that is entering a new phase. With the USC Village, that’s something that we’re super excited about and I think that that is a double-edged sword in a sense that we recognize already that there’s going to be so many ideas, projects and different things that we’ll have to work toward in the realm of the Village as a whole. But that’s something that we’re definitely super excited for and I think it really brings a lot of new opportunities to students, it also makes our campus a much bigger place and what many people would argue, a much better place, so we’re just going to have to figure out what role student government can play in ensuring that that is meeting the needs of all students to the best of its ability. 
M — On that same vein, this happens with everything, when things are new there’s always that trial period, where things are kind of being explored, and I think with the Village it’s just going to be working with the administrators and community to ensure all constituencies are happy with how it’s running and kind of being that liason to make sure that things are running smoothly and how we can improve the student as well as community experience. 
If there was something you wanted to tell the student body at this point in time, what would it be? 
M — We’re excited for the year and hopefully it’s really prosperous. It’s an exciting time to be a Trojan.

The USC Village, the largest development project in the University’s history, officially opened Thursday with a grand celebration led by USC President C. L. Max Nikias. Thousands of students, families, faculty and community members were present to celebrate the opening of the $700 million, 15-acre residential and retail complex.
A statue of Hecuba, the Queen of Troy, was also publicly unveiled at the ceremony as the official female counterpart to Tommy Trojan.
In his opening speech, Nikias spoke passionately about the impact the USC Village will have on the community in the coming years, highlighting the amount of work that brought the project to fruition.
“[The USC Village took] more than 2.6 million hours of nearly 900 days of construction,” Nikias said. “We built this village to show our enduring commitment to our exceptional students and our beloved neighbors.”
He also spoke about the impact it will have on the local community and how it will shape the USC experience for future Trojans. The University will also host a Community Open House for nearby residents on Saturday.
“We have made a massive investment to provide our world-class students and our world-class faculty with a world-class village,” Nikias said.
Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price was also present at the event to speak on the impact of the USC Village on the surrounding Los Angeles community.
“As chair of the economic delegate committee [on the L.A. City Council], I support projects like the Village that provide a meaningful long-term investment to our community,” Price said.
Professors and students also attended the ceremony. Neelesh Tiruviluamala, an assistant professor of mathematics and faculty advisor in Priam Residential College at the USC Village, expressed his hopes for the USC VIllage to bring together individuals from outside the Trojan Family.
“The Village brings in a lot more locals,” Tiruviluamala said. “While the campus is closed off, we’re going to have people going to Trader Joe’s and Target, and they’ll begin to understand what the Trojan student experience is about.”
As a faculty advisor, Tiruviluamala hopes to integrate new outreach programs for the students living at USC Village to further engage with the surrounding communities. The group of USC Village faculty advisers and residential assistants will have the opportunity to develop unique residential programs.
“Even before the USC Village came along, there were programs like [the Joint Educational Project] where students are brought to nearby schools,” Tiruviluamala said.  “I hope that we can create programs that are educational, with outreach programs for students interested in reaching out to local schools and develop cultural programs.”
Nikias also hinted at the USC Village acting as a symbol of greater inclusivity on campus.
“Queen Hecuba, my fellow Trojans, will not only serve as a new symbol of Troy,” Nikias said, during the grand reveal of the bronze statue. “It will be a symbol celebrating the women of Troy.”
The Queen of Troy, sculpted by Christopher Slatoff, is not only a female counterpart to Tommy Trojan, but is accompanied by figures of her six daughters as well.
The daughters possess a culturally diverse set of features, while Hecuba herself resembles a woman of mixed ancestry. According to Slatoff in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, the sculptures of Hecuba’s daughters were modeled after women with Native American, black, Asian, Latina/o, Caucasian and Middle Eastern descents. Slatoff said he was inspired to give Hecuba Mayan and African facial features.
Hecuba’s daughters were connected by a sculpted ribbon with the words Arts, Humanities, Science, Technology, Medicine and Social Sciences inscribed on it — representative of USC’s educational focuses.
The base of the statue contains an English inscription translated from Euripides’ “Hecuba” written in ancient Greek: “Those who have power ought not exercise it wrongfully, nor when they are fortunate should they imagine that they will be so forever.”

USC Transportation has made changes to its car service providers for this school year with the addition of a new car rental service called Maven, a subdivision of General Motors. 
Anthony Mazza, the director of USC Transportation, explained the department’s annual contract reviewing process to determine quality providers. 
“This year we decided to send a request for [a] bid out to carshare providers in an attempt to explore other options besides Zipcar and see what enhancements were available in the carshare space so we could improve the students experience and provide more value than in the past,” Mazza said in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan. 
Since Maven’s launch in January 2016, General Motors has brought the service to college campuses across the United States, starting with the University of Michigan. USC will be the second college campus with the provider.
General Motors’ Maven also has a $500 million partnership with Lyft, USC’s safe ride provider for this school year. 
Last fall, Maven brought its cars to Los Angeles and has continuously added newer stations and vehicles in places with growing demand. 
“With several USC alumni on the Maven team, we knew USC’s campus would be a great spot for us to place vehicles,” Stephanie Rice, Assistant Communications Manager at Maven, said in an e-mail to the Daily Trojan. “Today at USC, the Maven app shows [rental] options like the Chevrolet Cruze, Malibu, Trax, Volt, GMC Acadia and Cadillac ATS.”
USC currently has 11 working Maven stations with 18 usable cars, and students will be able to rent cars after they sign-up on the Maven app with a valid credit card and driver’s license number. After students sign up, the verification process takes approximately 48 hours until they can begin reserving and renting cars. 
The Maven app also shows the number of cars available at each station and the location of each. Maven cars are located on or near campus at various parking structures close to student housing. 
There are cars available in parking structures at Parkside Apartments, Tuscany Apartments, Gateway Apartments, Jefferson Boulevard, Royal Street, McCarthy Way, Figueroa Street, Harris Residential Hall and Parking Lots 21, 27 and 49. 
Maven users can select between a sedan, a compact car or SUV for their rental, and the virtual key to the car is provided via the smartphone app. Car rentals start off at $5 an hour plus tax, with gas and insurance included within the service. For each rental, gas is included for the first 180 miles driven. 
“For USC students, Maven wants to provide a more connected, seamless car-sharing experience that offers access to vehicles loaded with technology and available by the hour,” Rice said.
