In response to a wave of student activism on college campuses across the country, including protests against police shootings of black civilians and demands for racial equality, several student groups hung Black Lives Matter banners along Trousdale Parkway. 
The banners, which were hung on Nov. 17, were a joint effort between Graduate Student Government and Undergraduate Student Government in partnership with the Center for Black Cultural & Student Affairs, Asian Pacific American Student Services, El Centro Chicano and the LGBT Resource Center.
These organizations began working on the idea for the banners in September. They were inspired by a similar movement at the University of Vermont, where a Black Lives Matter flag was raised on a spare flagpole. GSG Vice President Kris Coombs brought the idea forward, and GSG voted unanimously to approve it. The proposal was then passed in the GSG Senate and sponsored by USG. The banners then went through an extensive process carried out by the University administration to make sure they fit the rules and regulations for on-campus banners.
“When the idea was first generated, it was more like this just needs to happen because we just need to boost our support,” Coombs said. “We’d seen and heard a lot of the very divisive rhetoric that had been used in [President-elect Donald] Trump’s campaign, we’d seen the way that the issues of minority population had been pushed to the side, even in [Hillary Clinton’s] campaign.”
GSG Diversity Chair Claudia Chirino said the banners were important in order to make minority students on campus feel supported.
“Many are facing hate crimes in schools around the nation,” Chirino said. “We want to show that these students are not alone.”
Both USG and GSG have prepared for any backlash surrounding the banners, and some have already expressed concern, although much of the reaction from the student body has been positive.
“We got a couple of emails [from] students voicing concern,” Coombs said. “Some students felt like it was not appropriate because they thought it would be just as valid to raise ‘all lives matter’ flags or ‘blue lives matter’ flags. We did hear their concerns and we tried to discuss with them the evolution of Black Lives Matter.”
Coombs said the banners are the first step of what he hopes will develop into a larger administrative role in protecting underrepresented classes of USC students and addressing their concerns, especially after Trump’s victory.
“Where I would like to see the University step up is being very proactive and reassuring the students who might be most directly impacted by the immigration policies or taxation policies  that their futures at USC are safe and secure,” Coombs said. 
Moreover, Coombs urged the administration to make a public statement reaffirming its commitment to help students put at risk during a Donald Trump presidency, and to sever its connection to donors or trustees who do not support this view. 
“I think at some point, we have to decide who and what we’re willing to sacrifice to help others and what we’re willing to sacrifice to help ourselves,” Coombs said. “The University needs to be willing, if necessary, to cut ties with the people who are not going to put the students first.” 
The banners were put up shortly after cities across the nation, as well as USC’s campus, saw discriminatory incidents following Trump’s victory. At the Rossier School of Education, a piece of paper saying “Black Lives Matter” tacked on a corkboard was quickly crossed out and replaced with “All Lives Matter,” and two USC students were called “n-gger” shortly after the election, Coombs said. 
Coombs said that integrating support for minority students into the classroom will help minimize and eliminate further hate crimes.
“Statements look nice, they make for good news stories, [but] I don’t think that’s enough,” Coombs said. “I think what it really takes is direct programming … that needs to permeate through all the academic courses, all the extracurriculars. It needs to be part of the culture at USC.” 
The banners are reserved for a two-week period and scheduled to be taken down on Dec. 1. USG and GSG are working to get the banners on campus again in the spring semester. 
As an alum, I’m proud USC is hanging these banners. Students of color often feel unwelcome at their own school; I was asked for my ID so many times unlike my peers, and it gets frustrating having to prove my affiliation with the university. Having graduated four years ago, I’ve had so many people question whether or not I actually went to USC. Do I have to carry my diploma around with me? Frankly, my white peers don’t have to deal with that discrimination.
I’m not Black–and non-Black people of color benefit significantly from that privilege–but I applaud the university for taking this stance, and I hope to see more actions. Black Lives Matter means that historically Black lives haven’t mattered, and we need to do something about that harsh reality. We can say “all lives matter” when it’s actually true. Till then, Black Lives Matter and NoDAPL!
This is such a delicate subject that I’m nervous to even wade into the murky waters… But that said, there is a lot of reason to be circumspect with regard to the Black Lives Matter movement.  Though the sentiment behind it seems fair and reasonable enough, the philosophy of the organization behind it is troubling and questionable at best… racist at worst.  The Black Lives Matter movement is now a very organized, funded and politically motivated group that has more in common with hateful Louis Farrakhan types than actual civil rights.  More specifically, the movement overlooks the reality that many of the incidents involving police shootings of black individuals were completely justified after an objective review of the circumstances involved.  The movement successfully disregards the behaviour of the individual leading up to the shooting, and appears to justify a second and separate set of standards for black people when it comes to their conduct when encountering law enforcement.
I recently read an articulate article in the Los Angeles Times, written by a black man from Los Angeles.  He discussed the concept of “the conversation” that black parents purportedly have with their children (particularly their sons).  He wrote that the “conversation” he remembers involved respect for authority and compliance with law enforcement in particular.  His family was keenly aware of our nation’s historic mistreatment of blacks, but he was never taught to use that as a reason to disrespect authority, or ignore police commands when caught in a confrontation.
I’m very concerned with the militant and anarchist underpinnings behind the Black Lives Matter organization.  I’m concerned that emotion and rhetoric has overcome sound judgment over the case-by-case realities, leading to general disrespect for police and authority in general.  For these reasons, I do not think it is appropriate for the University to authorize the placement of the Black Lives Matter banners on campus.
Black Lives matter = Kill White Cops.  Blacks who support that “cause” are racist pigs. 
All Lives Matter!

In the aftermath of a polarizing election, several USC students are using social media to help heal the divide. Ryan Williams, Andrea Juarez, Daniel Luo and Angie Mendoza created the 65 Days Toward Unity social media campaign to foster a sense of unity in the school community amid an abundance of contrasting political views. 
The campaign was launched on Nov. 15, a week after Republican President-elect Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the general election, and will last until Jan. 20. Williams, a senior majoring in bassoon performance; Juarez, a senior majoring in communication and linguistics; Luo, a graduate occupational therapy student; and Mendoza, a senior majoring in psychology and NGOs and social change, operate a Facebook page and Twitter account for the campaign. There, they ask daily questions, post suggestions for random acts of kindness and share post-election articles and events. Both the questions and daily acts of kindness are designed to be general and unrelated to politics, so that anybody can participate comfortably. 
“[The goals of the campaign are] to promote the safety and respect of everyone, to engage followers in random acts of kindness and daily challenges that encourage self-reflection, to provide a safe space for open communication and the sharing of events and ideas and to inspire a culture of empathy that lasts beyond the 65 Day Movement,” according to a statement released by the 65 Days Toward Unity team.
Mendoza, who operates as the head of the campaign, said she was inspired to begin the online efforts after witnessing anger-driven discussions on social media and on campus between Clinton and Trump supporters.
“What I’ve been seeing is, when people disagree with each other, they start calling each other names,” Mendoza said. “Instead of making judgment calls, the conversation needs to be, ‘Okay, you disagree with me. Let me try to understand your point of view so we can make a compromise.’”
Karen North, a professor of communication and the director of the Digital Social Media program at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said social media may have contributed to the alienation of certain voters during the election and masked the magnitude of Trump’s support. 
“There was such heated debate, and anger and hostility on social media, [that] a lot of people did not admit to the pollsters or their friends who they were voting for,” North said. “Therefore, the information we were using to predict what our world would be like on Election Day was flawed.” 
The 65 Days Toward Unity team hopes to address this issue of alienation on both sides of the political spectrum in part by selecting and sharing articles that try to provide insight into different viewpoints. Since the campaign is run by students with fairly liberal viewpoints, Mendoza said the team is careful about being nonpartisan. 
“If we have an article that presents a certain view, when we share that article we pose it in a more open-ended way,” Mendoza said. “We show that it’s not us agreeing with one side, but rather us asking ‘what do you think about this?’” 
While students have said that they appreciate the efforts of the 65 Days Toward Unity team, they also think it will be difficult for the campaign to genuinely change behaviors and mentalities.
“I think it’s an amazing idea,” said Gabby Fernandez, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and narrative studies. “But I think it’s a little optimistic to believe that everyone will follow through.” 
Mendoza also said that transforming ideas online into a sustained movement will be a challenge. Right now, the campaign is focused on building momentum and gaining followers. Mendoza’s goal is to eventually set up a Facebook group so that their followers can organize concrete plans for social change. 
“This group will serve as a space for our followers who have agreed to communicate peacefully and respectfully to come together and come up with an idea for how we can ensure that everyone’s voices are heard for elections to come,” Mendoza said.

The student who died in the Gamma Epsilon Omega fraternity house last week has been identified as 19-year-old Joseph Paek, a senior who was majoring in creative writing.
The cause of death was ruled a suicide by multiple stab wounds, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner. Police stated the night his body was found that they did not believe his death was a result of academic stress or hazing, while the coroner’s report said that Paek suffered from depression. 
Paek joined Gamma Epsilon Omega fraternity, the first Asian-interest fraternity in Southern California, in the fall of 2015 and held the position of Brotherhood Chair this semester. He was originally from Los Angeles, according to the fraternity’s website.
Paek was found unconscious when the residents of the fraternity house went to check his room after becoming concerned that he had not been seen since 2 a.m. on Thursday. 
The death was reported at approximately 4:35 p.m. after paramedics arrived, followed by Department of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
LAPD handled the investigation into Paek’s death before handing it over to the Coroner’s Office. 
The University administration and the Gamma Epsilon Omega fraternity did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

A USC alumnus is among 32 Americans to be honored with the Rhodes Scholarship, a prestigious award that grants the recipient a chance to study at the University of Oxford in England.
Oscar De Los Santos, who graduated in 2015 with a degree in political science, was one of the recipients announced by the Rhodes Trust on Nov. 19. At USC, he was a Truman Scholar and a Phi Beta Kappa member, and received USC’s Order of the Laurel and Palm, which is granted to less than 1 percent of the graduating class, according to USC News.
At Oxford, De Los Santos plans to work toward a Master of Public Policy and a Master of Studies in Theology with a focus on Christian ethics.
“I’m the child of Mexican immigrants, an anti-hunger advocate and a former teacher and political organizer,” De Los Santos wrote in an email to The Associated Press, USC News reported. “My degree choices are a way for me to respond from a sense of moral urgency to help marginalized people,” He added that his parents “were undocumented immigrants when they came to this country, but they’re citizens now.”
During his time at USC, De Los Santos worked as an intern for the National Economic Council and the U.S. House of Representatives. He also served as the youngest Florida field organizer for President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. After graduating, De Los Santos taught English and social studies to sixth graders at the Champion South Mountain School in Phoenix, Arizona and then went on to work as a lobbyist and manager of public policy for the Association of Arizona Food Banks.
The 32 American students will join an international group of scholars from 18 jurisdictions around the world, with a total of 95 scholars going on to pursue higher education at Oxford.

The Trojans wrap up their regular season when longtime, nonconference rival Notre Dame visits the Coliseum on Saturday.
The Trojans (8-3) have won seven straight games — all of which against Pac-12 opponents — while the Fighting Irish (4-7) are coming off a 34-31 loss to Virginia Tech last week. The Irish have not won consecutive games all year.
After a decisive 36-14 win over crosstown rival UCLA at the Rose Bowl last Saturday, the Trojans have had to refocus on their current opponent and give the next game their full attention.
“After every single game that we win, we sing our song, do our thing and move on,” redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold said. “We’ve just got to take that mindset every single week. If we keep doing that, we’ll find ourselves in a good position in the end.”
USC is looking for a final win to cap what has been a tale of two seasons. After three losses in their first four games, the Men of Troy have rattled off seven in a row, with the pinnacle of their turnaround coming two weeks ago when the Trojans traveled to Washington and defeated the then-No. 4 Huskies.
“It feels good,” senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers said. “It feels regular to us right about now. You’ve got to stay humble.”
The offensive prowess of the Trojans has been praised, specifically the play of Darnold. He has averaged 220.7 yards per game while completing 68.3 percent of his passes and connecting for 24 touchdowns. However, Darnold has also thrown eight interceptions this year, with two of those coming last week against UCLA.
Darnold’s Irish counterpart is junior DeShone Kizer, who is completing 59.3 percent of his passes and averaging 245.9 yards per game. He has thrown 24 touchdowns and eight interceptions this season. Kizer is a threat with both his arm and his feet, setting the Notre Dame record last season for single-season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback with 10. This year Kizer leads the team in rushing touchdowns with seven.
“Elite arm, but has the ability to create in the run game,” head coach Clay Helton said. “You’re talking about a quarterback that already has over 500 yards rushing and then you see him spread the ball around to several different receivers. He’s a very talented kid; a kid that will end up playing on Sundays.”
The Trojan defense has excelled during the seven-game win streak, holding six opponents to their season low in scoring up to that point. 
“It’s setting up third down situations and we’ve been really good on third down the past several weeks and it’s made for a good defensive output,” Helton said.
There hasn’t been one specific player on the defensive unit that has been dominating opponents. However, Helton has specifically praised redshirt senior defensive lineman Stevie Tu’ikolovatu and sophomore defensive lineman Rasheem Green for their presence inside and stopping the run game.
Though Notre Dame has struggled this season, Helton said his team is prepping as though this is a playoff game — the same mentality the team has maintained the whole year.
“Now we have to go do our job again against a rivalry team that has great personnel,” Helton said. “Their record is not the same as their personnel. Their personnel is very talented and they’ve lost some close games over and over this year but I know they’re going to come here charged up, especially with it being a rivalry game.”
This will be the 88th meeting of the two rivals. USC has defeated Notre Dame in 10 of the last 14 games, but all four losses have been since 2010, including last year’s 41-31 loss in South Bend. This year the game kicks off at 12:30 p.m. and is being televised nationally on ABC.

Standout offensive performances have undoubtedly been the main spectacle behind USC’s current seven-game winning streak. Whether it has been redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold rolling out of the pocket and making defenders miss before tossing a dart to junior wide receiver Juju Smith-Schuster in Arizona; sophomore running back Ronald Jones II busting off a 60-yard touchdown run last Saturday against UCLA; or redshirt freshman tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe catching a score against Washington, USC currently has one of the hottest offensive units in the nation.
While the offense has supplied the flash — racking up over 500 total yards in six of its last seven games — the Trojan defense has been the reliable backbone behind USC’s turnaround this season. 
In its most recent outing, the USC defense shut out UCLA in the second half of the Trojans’ 36-14 victory Saturday night. 
After surrendering 47 rushing yards to UCLA in the first quarter, USC allowed only eight yards on the ground throughout the final three quarters Saturday. 
“We’re just buying into the coaches’ defensive schemes for us right now,” said redshirt senior nose tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu. “We’ve really been playing disciplined and sticking with our defensive assignments lately.”
Much of UCLA’s offensive prosperity was choked out by the Trojans’ defense following the opening quarter of play. The Trojans held the Bruins to three total first downs after the first quarter; after scoring a touchdown with 13:29 remaining in the second quarter, UCLA would not convert another first down until 9:18 was left in the third quarter. USC ran a total of 98 plays Saturday — UCLA had only 52 plays run in total. In total, UCLA was 2-of-11 (18 percent) converting on third downs Saturday.
USC’s ability to get UCLA off of the field on third down defensively — paired with the Trojans’ strong offensive showing — led to the team dominating the Bruins in time of possession, 43:47 to 16:13.
“You see our team getting better every week, our defense is coming together,” said senior linebacker and team captain Michael Hutchings. “As you look at the past few weeks, it just confirms what we are doing as a team … staying level-headed, maturing each week and just going about things like that — that goes out to the young guys we have playing up front.”
USC’s biggest win of the season, which came in the form of a 26-13 victory over then-No. 4 Washington on Nov. 12, saw the Trojan defense play at its finest. A run-happy Washington offense was restrained to 17 yards on the ground against USC. Washington sophomore quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Jake Browning was forced into throwing two interceptions and had a quarterback rating of 30.4.
“It was one of those things where we capitalized as a defense — we were just trying to put pressure on [Browning], make sure he was off his rhythm and timing,” said junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson, who reeled in two interceptions against Washington. “It was just a case of us stepping up as a defense together.” 
USC’s defense has experienced a dramatic turnaround production-wise since the Trojans began their seven-game winning streak with a 41-20 victory over Arizona State on Oct. 1. 
Over the course of the first four games of 2016 — in which USC started with a 1-3 record — the Trojans’ defense was giving up 29.25 points per game. Over the winning streak these past seven games, USC has, in contrast, allowed only 17.4 PPG to opposing offenses. In the six games leading up to UCLA Saturday, USC held its opponents to their season-low total in points scored in a game up to that point.
“You look up and you hold UCLA to 55 yards rushing compared to 260 yards rushing offensively, I thought that was the key to the game,” said USC coach Clay Helton regarding the defensive performance Saturday. “I thought the defense, who really all of a sudden has a hit to them in that first drive, they take a deep breath and they really showed great, great poise.” 
Since playing the Sun Devils back on Oct. 1, USC has held opponents to an average of 95.8 rushing YPG the last seven games.
When this USC defense takes on Notre Dame at the Coliseum Saturday, it will be pitted against a Fighting Irish offense that has averaged 418.5 total yards per game (61st in FBS). The Trojans will need another strong defensive showing if USC hopes to finish its regular season in victorious fashion.

After a thrilling 2-point victory against Texas A&M in College Station last Friday, USC men’s basketball has two opportunities at home to extend its undefeated start to the season this Thanksgiving week.
On Tuesday night, the Trojans challenge the New Orleans Privateers at the Galen Center. The Privateers (1-2) are a high volume 3-point shooting team. They make 6.7 3s-per-game at a clip of 36.4 percent. The Privateers are also proficient defenders, averaging 9.3 steals per game and 3.7 blocks per game. However, although they have forced 17 turnovers per game  they have also committed 16 per game this season. USC will have to start and finish the game composed, dictating the pace of the game and overcoming the Privateers’ pressure. 
“Anytime you have offensive talent, your (opponent) is dangerous,” Enfield said. “We need to play the same type of defense we have been — holding teams to under 40 percent from the field and rebounding.”
In the Privateers’ first game versus a power conference team, they were blown out at Oklahoma State, 117-72. They allowed an astonishing 68 first half points, and OSU scored 31 points off of turnovers.
 If the Trojans can showcase their transition offense on Tuesday night, they can experience their first run-away game. However, three close games in a row has shown that nothing can be taken for granted with this young team. 
USC’s biggest test of the young season is on Friday night versus Southern Methodist. The Mustangs have won three of four to start the year, including a win versus Pitt. However, SMU followed that win with a deflating 22 point loss to Michigan. Michigan hit 13 3-point shots against SMU at a rate of 41 percent — an incredible performance. On offense on Friday night, look for USC to try to emulate Michigan’s success by scoring prolifically from beyond the arc. 
The Trojans will also have to shut down 6”7’, 235-pound  forward Semi Ojeleye, a Duke transfer, who is averaging 20 points, nine rebounds and four assists in his first several games as a Mustang. Ojeleye has an NBA-ready body and skills to go along with his physicality. He can hit an open three, rarely turns the ball over and can rebound especially well for a wingman. He will definitely cause matchup problems for the Trojans, who have many long wingmen but no one who can match his physicality. 
SMU’s fatal flaw is its lack of size. The Mustangs are deep at guard and small forward, but only Australian freshman Harry Froling is taller than Ojeleye. Froling has played fewer than 15 minutes per game this year, averaging only 3 points. 
USC’s big men will have to overcome their early season woes to give the Trojans a victory on Friday. Redshirt senior forward Charles Buggs will have to score off the bench and freshman forward Nick Rakocevic cannot continue to put himself in early foul trouble. Metu will have to score more efficiently, and Boatwright will have to quickly shake off his offseason rust.
Speed and perimeter play are the hallmarks of USC’s game, but on Friday night, SMU might be superior in length and athleticism. USC must put forth a great effort on the boards, at the line and from behind the arc this week to remain undefeated.
Friday’s win against a power conference team in Texas A&M on the road was an impressive testament to the Trojan’s talent. No doubt, the victory will help the team’s resume come March. 
“To get a win like that means a lot to our program early in the season,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We hope that win means something down the road, but we have to get a lot better.”
The win certainly was not pretty, and USC must continue to improve to win both of this week’s match-ups. Sophomore forward Chimeze Metu identifies slow starts as a problem. 
“Once we get deeper into the season, teams are going to be a lot better, and they’re going to keep the lead,” Metu said. “We need to be focused at the start of games and stay focused.”
So far this season, the Trojan offense has started slow in every game and then sputtered at the beginning of each second half. The team shot a meager 35.8 percent on Friday and an abysmal 5-26 from 3-point range, even with sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright making his season debut. 
USC is shooting 25 percent from three this season, a 13 percent drop from last year. The Trojans hope this number is low because of a limited three game sample. 
Another takeaway from last Friday’s win was Melton’s clutch performance. The freshman has helped his team immediately.
“It means a lot that the coaches trust me to contribute right away, to close off games and to play freely,” Melton said. 
He hopes playing freely will enable the offense to come alive this week.
Tuesday night’s game tips off at 6 p.m., while Friday’s contest starts at 4 p.m.

As the band boomed the Fight Song for the final time of the night, senior wide receiver De’Quan Hampton clambered up the director’s ladder and shoved the sword in his left fist into the air. 
Hampton bobbed up and down, shimmying and bouncing to the beat. On the field, his teammates cheered for him — “Yeah, ‘Quan! Get it, man!” 
It lasted for a minute, this moment in the spotlight. But for a transfer senior who’s seen little of the field and even less of the endzone, it was a moment to soak in. And after a 36-14 victory of UCLA — which he could take 12 points worth of credit for — Hampton was loving every second of it.
“It was amazing,” Hampton said. “It felt like a dream.”
Hampton’s role this season had been fairly secure — playing back-up behind the talented wide receiver unit of junior JuJu Smith-Schuster and senior Darreus Rogers, scrapping for minutes where he could get them. In the first 10 games of this season, he snagged four catches for a total of 22 yards, ranking 12th in team receiving yards behind redshirt sophomore Jalen Greene.
But the UCLA game — like all rivalry games, tempestuous and unpredictable — called for a hero. And for three plays and a handful of minutes, Hampton became that player for the Trojans.
It takes a perfect combination of variables to create a breakout game. For Hampton, that was a hip flexor and his quarterback’s trust.
Smith-Schuster was hurting from the first drive of the game. He roped in a 28-yard catch to bring the Trojans to the 1-yard line, and sophomore running back Ronald Jones punched it in to tie the game with a typical USC offensive play. 
But in the second quarter, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold threw an interception and Smith-Schuster, favoring his hip, limped into the locker room. The Bruins scored off a 7-yard touchdown pass, and suddenly the Trojans were trailing 14-7 in their rival’s home stadium.
They needed someone to step up, and Hampton did it in style.
He touched the ball three times in total, despite coming second behind Smith-Schuster in receiving yards for the game. But those three touches changed the momentum of the final game of conference play.
The first time, Hampton ran his route down the left side of the field, stutter stepped, then lept into the air and snatched the ball from over the outstretched arms of his defender. Hampton had 6 inches on his defender, but the lofted toss required trust from Darnold that his receiver could make the play. 
For Darnold, it wasn’t hard to trust Hampton.
“[Our coaches] really preach giving our guys a chance when they have one-on-one coverage,” Darnold said. “I think you’re never wrong throwing it to a guy one-on-one, especially when he’s in the position [Hampton] was. I always feel great throwing it up to them.” 
His second touch was a simple 6-yard pass that happened to be in the end zone, and happened to put the Trojans up 30-14 in a momentum-swinging third quarter. And the third was a 14-yard catch for a first down at the 50-yard line. Together, the three plays doubled Hampton’s season yardage. 
For head coach Clay Helton, this type of break-out play is necessary for the team to continue the success of their seven-game winning streak. 
“You have kids who have just been dying for their opportunity and they made the most of it,” Helton said. “That’s what a team is. You hope that when one guy goes down, another one has prepared himself to make those types of plays.”
Saturday’s success was a welcome change for Hampton. Last year, he expressed frustration with the one-track focus of former quarterback Cody Kessler, who completed three times as many passes to Smith-Schuster than to any other receiver. 
It was a long season for Hampton. He had transferred from Long Beach Community College as a junior  and caught the ball only 15 times in his first year as a Trojan, and this year was going even more slowly until the game against UCLA. But Hampton said that after this year, he trusted that he would have his moment.
“I didn’t doubt it, because I’ve seen chances come for other players,” Hampton said. “So I just say that means just keep grinding, because my chance might come this game or the next or the next. I just have to be ready.” 
When that moment came, he was an easy guy to cheer for, Darnold said. He describes the senior as a “goofy guy,” the type to lead dance parties on and off the field, cheering on his teammates from the sideline no matter how many minutes he played.
The party in the Rose Bowl ended eventually, with Trojan fans booming out chants and singing along to “Tusk” as UCLA fans trickled out of the stands. After the final notes of the Fight Song rang out, Hampton climbed down from the ladder, joining his teammates in the locker room and basking in a flock of reporters’ cameras and recorders pressed into his face. 
That might be it for his moment. As a senior, he’ll have one, at most three, games left with the team. But if that’s the note he ends on — two touchdowns and a rivalry win — well, that’s just alright with him.
“It was worth the wait,” Hampton said. “As much frustration as I had being in the position I was, waiting for the opportunity, when it came it’s all worth it.”

It is a great time to be a USC football fan. Looking back at the first couple weeks of the season, I would have never thought I would be saying that right now. The growth and maturity that this team has shown through the season, along with their ability to battle back, are why it’s such a great time to be a part of Trojan Nation. 
Of course, it is probably amazing to be a student while your team is regarded as one of the top teams in the nation and has a legitimate chance at playing in the playoff, but to me, there is something just as gratifying being a student while your team is building the foundation for an eventual championship run. 
The talk surrounding the program was predominantly about firing head coach Clay Helton, whether that be during the season while the team was losing or at the eventual end of the season. In addition to that, the general mood for a lot of USC fans was disappointment and anger. 
USC didn’t let that get to them, though. After the loss to Utah, a different USC has taken the field every Saturday since that game in Salt Lake City. It’s a team with a renewed confidence. A team with swagger. A team that actually knows how to take advantage of their talent and pick apart their opponent’s weaknesses. 
Frankly, it’s been some of the most fun I’ve had as a sports fan. There’s something exhilarating about watching a team grow and continue to improve week-to-week. There’s nothing stagnant about watching this Trojan team extend their win streak to seven games. 
As the season has moved forward, each week has presented something new about the already well-known, talented team. Against the Bruins, I’m sure no one would’ve predicted that senior wide receiver De’Quan Hampton would have such an impact on the game. Hampton had two touchdowns for 51 yards on three catches. He was the only receiver to record a touchdown in the 36-14 rout against UCLA. 
In this foundational period of the team growing back to the prominence of a national powerhouse, it’s exciting to hear USC tossed around in national discussion of top college football teams. That’s a discussion that’s been largely absent over the last couple of seasons. When USC was talked about, it was usually with some coaching situation or off-the-field drama, which isn’t what you want to be known for as a team. 
It’s refreshing to finally be talked about once again as the team that no one, outside of Alabama, would want to play at the end of the season. For lifelong Trojan fans that are now students, it’s what we grew up accustomed to hearing. To finally hear it as a student, it’s a refreshing reminder of what the USC football team used to be. 
Even if Colorado wins on Saturday night, which would keep USC out of the Pac-12 Championship game, this will still be a positive season for the Trojans. While it would be amazing to get to play up at Levi’s Stadium for the second season in a row, if the Trojans don’t make it up there, it won’t entirely be a disappointment. Yes, it will sting for a bit, but it’s important to focus on what’s in the future for this program.
The building blocks for success are here. It’s apparent as the Trojans have learned to dominate on all sides of the ball. The maturity this team has gained throughout the season is evident in their ability to push mistakes out of their minds during a game along with adapting a fluid game plan to consistently outperform their opponents. Both the Washington upset and the UCLA rout are examples of this. The Trojans made a number of mistakes, some costly ones that led to their opponents scoring, but they didn’t dwell on them. A perfect example of this is junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. In both games, miscues or mishaps during a play led to the other team scoring; however, Jackson didn’t let his mistakes define his play that game. He merely brushed them off and then played shutdown defense to finish the game. 
This season for USC started out bleak with a demoralizing loss to Alabama. The Stanford game was embarrassing as well. What’s important though, is where the team is now and where they’re headed. With the Trojans’ current state, there’s no better feeling than being a USC fan.

To write a book on the history of USC football is certainly ambitious, but Steve Delsohn’s Cardinal and Gold: The Oral History of USC Trojans Football offers a fast-paced, yet extensive look at the ups-and-downs of one the most traditional college football programs in the country. 
The 300-plus-page book begins by describing John Robinson replacing the departing John McKay as head coach in 1976 and ends with USC losing in the Holiday Bowl to Wisconsin last year. In between, Delsohn weaves the tale of 40 years of drama and storylines, from Larry Smith butting heads with Todd Marinovich to the complicated portrait of Pete Carroll’s legacy.
Younger fans who have only lived through the aftermath of the heavy sanctions imposed on the school in 2010 may find a fresh, intriguing read on the history of many Rose Bowl appearances and old stories of just how USC became USC.
“Here’s a program with a great history and yet the last seven years have been borderline chaos,” Delsohn said following a book signing at the USC bookstore earlier this month. “So, I thought from a storyline perspective, USC was a good choice.”
Delsohn, who works for ESPN’s Outside the Lines and has also written books on the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Notre Dame football program, said he likes writing about iconic institutions. 
The book, which was released earlier this year, features 125 voices — players, coaches, athletic directors, etc. — who generally come across as candid in describing their time at USC.
“When these guys are in college, they can’t really tell you too much about what’s going on behind the scenes,” Delsohn said. “When you talk to these guys years later, they can tell you what was actually going on.”
Delsohn, who said he spent two years doing research and about another year writing the book, noted that Marinovich, Robinson, Keyshawn Johnson, LenDale White and Keith Van Horne were among the most intriguing interviews. An oral history, the book is presented mostly as one quote after another to piece together each era of the football program.
“I like the form for certain subjects because it brings a sense of intimacy,” Delsohn said. “It’s almost like you’re sitting around having a beer or a cup of coffee with a player.”
Delsohn believes his subjects’ quotes are more important than what he has to say. The style creates a page-turning feel with juicy statements piled one after another, especially when Delsohn describes controversy-filled events such as a brawl breaking out at halftime of a game between USC and Notre Dame in 1989 when Fighting Irish players blocked the Trojans’ entrance to the tunnel or the aftermath of Carroll’s stunning departure in the midst of the sanctions.
 The Carroll saga is one of the highlights of the book, according to Delsohn, who starts a chapter titled “NCAA versus USC” with the sentence, “How do you replace Elvis once he leaves the building?”
“With controversies, I try to have different perspectives,” Delsohn said. “Like how much did Pete Carroll know about the NCAA sanctions when he left for Seattle? I try to have the whole spectrum of opinions and perspectives on that and let the reader decide.”
It’s hard to point to definite commonalities considering the roller coaster ride the program has endured over 40 years, but Delsohn pointed to USC’s propensity to hire from within and promote the ideal of the “Trojan Family” as an omnipresent theme throughout its history.
“They don’t seem like they like to hire outside the family too much,” Delsohn said. “The boosters have always been influential at USC. That hasn’t changed. It’s not going to change.”
Clay Helton, the man currently at the helm of the program, is another case of USC hiring its own. But Delsohn, who has dedicated countless hours over the last few years to piecing together the complex puzzle that is USC football, thinks the Trojans are on the upswing again.
“I think USC’s on the right track,” Delsohn said prior to USC’s win over Oregon on Nov. 5. “I really do. I think they did a nice job of not panicking when they were 1-3. They did a nice job of keeping it together.”
The hardcover version of the book is available on Amazon for $22.18.

Erika Lee | Daily TrojanCup of joe · To generate excitement for the Gilmore Girl’s revival, the UCLA campus recreated the show’s iconic East Coast town.
Stars Hollow came alive this weekend for attendees of The Festival of Four Seasons. Nestled in UCLA’s Dickson Court, the recreation of the beloved fictional Connecticut town featured all the favorites from the popular TV show Gilmore Girls. Running on ABC Family from 2000 to 2007, Gilmore Girls follows Lorelai and Rory, who act more like best friends than the mother and daughter they actually are, throughout their life in the town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. 
However, Lorelai and Rory were never the only residents in the town fans loved. The characters Kirk, Taylor, Lane and, of course, Lorelai’s love interest Luke are just some of the town residents that make the show what it is. 
Netflix revived the show for a four-part special that is being released Nov. 25. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will be four one-hour episodes that take place during each season. Though it’s been nine years since the show ended, fans are still obsessed with the show, as evidenced by the multi-hour wait to enter The Festival of the Four Seasons this weekend. Luckily, it was worth the wait for those devoted to the show. 
Festival attendees could fulfill every daily activity they’d seen Rory and Lorelai do for seven seasons: grab coffee at Luke’s Diner, pick up candy at Taylor’s Soda Shoppe, or claim a button at Kirk’s Button Emporium reading “team Jess,” “team Logan,” or “team Dean.” Walking through the town felt authentic, with decorative fall leaves and pumpkins covering the ground with music playing from the shops. 
Twinkling lights and pennant banners connected the town’s buildings together, guiding each person from one line to the next. The famous Kim’s Antiques (Unfortunately, Mrs. Kim was not there to harass you for a higher price) was situated next to the Stars Hollow Post Office that let guests send a Gilmore Girls postcard to anyone reminding them the show was being released on Netflix this coming week — leading into the main reason the entire event was free of charge: free advertising.
Promotional reminders for the Gilmore Girls event were situated in every corner of the venue, including the Stars Hollow Gazette office, featuring a photo booth. Some guests were lucky enough to catch some stars from the show, such as Yanic Truesdale, who plays everyone’s favorite hotel manager and calorie-counter, Michel. Girls dressed in flannel shirts and backwards baseball caps snapped photos of their Luke’s coffee cups while others in the show’s merchandise had their photo taken at the gazebo and town sign.

In high school, I had one of those old school CD pockets that would wrap around a sun visor in my car, which was inherited from my mom’s car in the ‘90s. I didn’t have satellite radio, and a guy can only hear so much Aerosmith on the seemingly endless local rock stations before he goes crazy. So I made sure to load up that CD pocket with nearly every CD I owned, which was surprisingly a lot, as I had amassed a collection that had variety to it.
As a result, I would often have to switch some CDs out to give my library some variation. Songs About Jane, The Marshall Mathers LP, some Beatles and other CDs made their way into the rotation. My jazz albums always stayed where they were, but one jazz album in particular had a permanent home in the same upper-second-to-last-from-the-right pouch in that black CD pocket, and got a lot of rotation in the winter months.
Horace-Scope was the first full-length jazz album I ever bought, and it’s still one of my favorites to this day. It was my first introduction to Horace Silver, who I think is one of the most talented hard bop players to come from the genre, and what an introduction it was. The lineup consisted of a group of musicians I had never heard of before, but Horace Silver on piano, Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Junior Cook on tenor sax, Gene Taylor on bass and Roy Brooks on drums certainly left a lasting impression on me with the work that they did on this album.
This core quintet had worked on previous Horace Silver albums before this, which is why their chemistry is uncanny. This is a group that doesn’t just play with each other; they actually listen to what the other is doing, which is, in my opinion, one of the most crucial elements of playing good, wholesome jazz. They play with a hive-mind-like aspect that gives their sound a quality of togetherness on a level that’s hard to come by, even in a big band with a composer conducting with an authoritative presence.
Mitchell and Cook play in unison for the majority of the melodies with the exception of one providing a harmony for the other, so they’re not always just playing the same note. It keeps things simple while adding a layer of complexity to their sound to keep you interested, as if they needed help in that area. Listening to the breakneck tempos of “Where You At?” and “Horace Scope,” it’s a wonder they don’t pass out in the studio, let alone play in unison. Still, despite the multifaceted melodies, these two play with pitch-perfect and mirror-like qualities, making them almost indistinguishable from one another. It’s certainly impressive on the faster-paced songs on the album, and it makes the slower-paced songs sound truly polished on the ears.
These two are definite highlights on the album, but the other band members can’t be overlooked either. Taylor certainly knows how to keep a groove, and his mastery over the dynamic tempos on this album might be unnoticed to an untrained ear, but they’re not underappreciated. Brooks loves to wear out his ride cymbal on this album, which is characteristic of many bop drummers, but damn, could he smack and glide around his entire kit. Of all the solos he has on this album, his 42-second tour de force is a prime example of how the genre of hard bop had the best drummers in jazz bar none.
The best example of this group’s immaculate cohesion is on “Nica’s Dream,” which is one of my favorite jazz tunes of all time. One second it’s a Latin-tune, then, on a dime, it switches to swing. The melody is intricate to the point where it sounds like Mitchell and Cook are just improvising, but then the drums, piano, bass, trumpet and sax all come together carry a tune so perfect it almost sounds like a machine is playing every instrument; but then, of course, it wouldn’t be jazz.
It’s hard to say if this is my favorite jazz album of all time, but it’s probably one of the most sentimental. One time, while I was at my friend Billy’s house, we decided to go for a quick drive, but we could still see our breath in front of us, even as we were sitting in my car. My friend reached up for the music folder and for some reason chose this album to accompany our late-night adventure to the Mobil that was seven minutes away. This became a ritual of sorts, and Horace and the gang would keep us company as we drove through the abandoned streets of the suburbs in frigid temperatures to get some unhealthy hors d’oeuvres. Even though the temperature was below zero degrees every night we went out, I have some pretty warm memories associated with this album.

It is easy to envy the little girls growing up under this new vein of animated Disney movies where archery is a vital skill, sisterhood replaces true love’s kiss and a teenage girl sails into the unknown to bring hope back to her kingdom. In Brave, Frozen and now Moana, there is no more talk of girls being saved — instead, girls are the ones doing the saving: heroines whose curiosity, loyalty and sense of adventure are bigger than any hero. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, Moana, the most recent example of this important trend, surmounts the rest.
More colorful, more fun, the protagonist more fearless than ever before, Moana takes its genre and stretches it as far as it can go, seizing the hearts and eyes of viewers along the way. Complete with sparkling visuals, soaring and bouncing musical numbers and a tale of boundless female energy and adventure, Moana is an unforgettable voyage for moviegoers of all ages.
Moana is a Pacific Islander, the daughter of the chief of Motunui island. The movie begins with the flora and fauna of Motunui falling into despair, a curse set in place when a demigod named Maui stole the heart of the Pacific’s mother island and lost it to the ocean. In this movie, the ocean is a character, too, and it delivers this heart — a sparkling, green stone — to Moana when she was a little girl.
At 15 years old, Moana (Auli’i Cravalho) lives with her parents and grandmother on Motunui, which she knows she will one day inherit as chief. For as long as she can remember, Moana has been drawn to the sea, and what is inside and beyond it. Moana’s father knows that the sea and what is out there is dangerous, and forbids his daughter from ever going past the reef that encircles Motunui. However, living on an island and surrounded on all sides by the dazzling ocean, this is a heavy weight for Moana to bear.
Moana is going to be chief one day, and seeing the life of her island disintegrate, she embarks on an unthinkably perilous journey across the Pacific: to find Maui, and to make him lead her to the mother island where he can restore the heart and bring life back to the Pacific. When she finds Maui (Dwayne Johnson), he is not who Moana expects him to be, but then again, Moana is discovering herself on this voyage, too. In a sense, Moana is an odyssey — an exploration of the ocean, a discovery of friendship and one’s own true strength.
The musical numbers in the movie are as important as the ocean itself, and they range from jazzy to heart-soaring while utilizing the instruments and rhythm of island life. Music team Opetaia Foa’i, Mark Mancina and Lin-Manuel Miranda (of Hamilton fame) composed the funky and fantastic soundtrack, unique to the film’s culture but also not without Disney’s signature sweeping songs. In “How Far I’ll Go,” Frozen’s “Let It Go” has finally found a competitor.
It is hard to come by a film that audiences will keep talking about long after they leave the theater, and rarer still for this film to be an animated family movie. And yet, set smack in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the stakes here feel as high as in any action movie. And Moana is more than strong — she is relentlessly brave.
In the movie, it’s not as much the sea choosing Moana as Moana choosing to take on the sea. Not only are legend and folklore are at play, but also courage and brazen curiosity. Moana is an important movie for young girls and for everyone in the modern era of storytelling. With its newest release, Disney is leading the trend in changing on-screen representation of different demographics. Moana is a wave audiences won’t want to miss.

After a four-year hiatus, Bruno Mars finally returns to the music scene with 24K Magic, his third studio album. Mars has been known for releasing sleek, concise albums that integrate catchy hooks into a strong cohesive work. This is still the case, as he captured the funk and soul he strived for with the creation of this album. 
With only nine songs, 24K Magic played at a mere 33 minutes. The first half of the songs on the record was high tempo, high energy and incredibly catchy. Nearly every song on the album was produced by first time producers Shampoo Press & Curl. In the second half of the album, Mars slowed things down with ballads that resembled those of Michael Jackson during the height of his career. While the production was clean and well-mixed, the ballads couldn’t support the shallow lyrics present on most of the album.
Mars opened the album with “24K Magic,” an electrifying introduction to his new sound. For the first time, Mars established himself as a top dog and boasted about his riches. While the song was undeniably catchy and sounded like a younger sibling to the Mark Ronson collaboration “Uptown Funk,” it felt like the singer sold out. 
One of the most troubling lyrics within the opening song is, “bad b—tches and your ugly ass friends.” Gone were the serenading words of chart-topping hits such as “Locked Out of Heaven” and “Just the Way you Are.” Mars sounded less like he would catch a grenade for his lover and more like would refer to women as grenades with this new attitude. 
Mars quickly retracted this mentality, however, with the second song “Chunky.” The mid-tempo jam had Mars describing his ideal woman. It was catchy and funky and also empowers women. He often walked the line between respect and offense toward women with several songs in the album.
Following “That’s What I Like” is the album’s second pre-released single “Versace on the Floor.” With a resemblance to “When I Was Your Man,” Mars slows things down for a powerful ballad with a synth backed by handclaps. The song is sexy and catchy, but easily forgettable when compared to the other tracks on the record.
“Finesse” provided a much-needed beat change for the record, but its content was too hollow to reignite the excitement of the early tracks on 24K Magic. Mars closed the album with a more raw, slow-burning ballad “Too Good to Say Goodbye.” The song represented the deeper, meaningful lyrics Mars is generally known for. The song saved the album from being completely hollow. 
With 24K Magic, Bruno Mars brought together a collection of songs into what could be his most sonically cohesive album yet. While the lyrical content at times felt shallow and insincere, Mars clearly had a lot of fun in the recording process. Fans of his previous work will mostly be satisfied by the fun, danceable tracks on the album. The record was undoubtedly fun and smooth, but was not deep enough to warrant a second or third listen.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
The greatest enemy to this country is not President-elect Donald Trump or those who disagree with him. The greatest enemy that a nation-state has is irreversible strife within itself. Today, we see that kind of great civil division among us. 
With people from both sides of the aisle blinded by planks in their own eyes, each have come to believe that they are the ones seeing things most objectively, and the others are suffering from bouts of naïve realism. The reciprocation of disrespect between disagreeing citizens has turned into meaningless lashing out among certain people. Our nation has become embroiled in a divisive culture of politics. We’re forgetting the whole point of our nation’s values: the freedom to speak, assemble and express without persecution. We’re forgetting what it means to be American. We’re forgetting that the only way to get through all this if we stand together. We’re failing to love one another. But worst of all, we’re failing to remember who we are, what we stand for and what really matters. 
As Thanksgiving approaches, it’s time for all of us on campus to better appreciate the fellow Americans we study with. Remember at the end of the day, we’re all Trojans. We’re all Americans.
The people who support Trump shame the supporters of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, while those who support her shame those who support him. Each side accuses the other and so on, so forth. The stream of endless articles on the election is fatiguing. But there’s little point in continuing to describe “ifs” and “should haves,” because whether we voted for him or not, what’s done is done. The right thing to do would be to take responsibility for our nation and hold our leader accountable. Especially as we enter into a time of giving thanks, it’s time to do away with the insults, mocking and rioting that accomplishes nothing. Again, it comes down to this: remembering. When we finally cool down, hopefully, some of us will remember that the one Democratic neighbor living down the street is an American. That one Republican neighbor is an American. Both Clinton and Trump are Americans. 
But people who know much may still forget often.  Poet T.S. Eliot, in his poem “The Information Age” discusses just how prone we are to forgetting our values: “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” Some of us know so much about politics, American history, the President-elect, the economy, foreign relations and what leadership is. But sometimes that knowledge can blind us from seeing what’s right in front of us: each other. For everyone disappointed in the recent elections, just remember that Trump’s mandate to lead rests upon your approval. To clarify, he is the next president — no argument to be made there. However, it is we the people who can support our leader or bitterly oppose him for the next four years. We must be prudent with the knowledge that we carry. We, as Americans, as the single greatest asset or threat to a government, have to know how to translate information into useful knowledge that can be applied wisely. We have the choice to either let the better or worse parts of our nature show.
As Thanksgiving approaches in a couple days, we must remember what really matters. Remember we are a family. Remember we are Americans. Whoever is leading us, whoever is president, our nation is one family. For all the prejudiced against, you are Americans first and foremost. In his second inaugural address, former President Abraham Lincoln hoped that the people of this nation would act right “as God gives us to see the right.” This is still important today, because we have the capacity to decide with firmness in the right to act right. Whatever our personal preferences may have been or continue to be, anyone who is an American should strive “to bind up the nation’s wounds” and act “with malice toward none, with charity for all.”

Democrats nationwide are still scrambling to cobble their party together. The moderate message of Hillary Clinton won the approval of the party, but not the American people. For certain, there is evidence that suggests that it was not purely Clinton’s positions that lost her the Presidency. However, what must not be ignored is that 43 percent of eligible voters did not cast a vote, and that even in counties where Clinton won a supermajority of votes, voter turnout was down by a small margin. In contrast, in counties where Donald Trump won a supermajority, voter turnout was up. The Democrats need to adjust their rhetoric and platform in order to attract the votes that they lost to Trump, but what adjustments are most appropriate are not immediately clear. Democrats have a choice – to hold the line or to imitate Trump’s “America first” appeals. In either case, the Democrats must entice millennials and minority populations to vote, in addition to pulling the white working class back into their fold. Millennials must play a central role in this necessary change.
People all over the country have felt as if the government has not done enough for them over the past eight years under a Democratic administration, especially African Americans and millennials, who are traditionally Democratic bulwarks. And because of this fact, potential Democratic voters did not flock to the polls the same way that they did when Barack Obama’s promises were new and inspiring to them. Many felt as if the Democrats had not done anything in particular for them, and they had little reason to believe that a Clinton presidency would change that. So they didn’t vote.
Democrats cannot challenge the Republicans hold on the federal government during midterm elections if this does not change. The Democratic Party’s platform was largely written to accommodate the followers of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Even this, however, did not persuade enough millennials to cast their vote for the Democrats to gain any substantial power: Democrats barely managed to gain six representatives in the House.
The Democrats need to persuade young and disillusioned voters that they are their party – that their voices are heard and their needs will be met. Millennials occupy a unique place in American politics: they now outnumber even baby boomers, and that statistic will only become more relevant as scores of young people come of age. Millennials are a diverse group by any metric, but the majority lean left. Democratic millennials also tend to have views that are divergent from the Democratic old guard, tending to land further left on the political spectrum than the mainline of the party. The strength of Bernie Sanders’s candidacy among young people is evidence of this trend. 
Young Democrats can influence the party’s position by involving themselves more in politics, in becoming more active in political student groups and by participating in campaigns. Millennials are the future of America, and whatever their consensus is will inevitably influence American politics.
The fact of the matter is this: The Democratic Party needs to change. If it wants to attract more millennial votes, and this election shows that it needs to, it needs to pay closer attention to their desires and reconcile them as best as it can with the needs of its other major constituencies. Core millennial concerns, like job availability, are not purely millennial. Sanders and Trump shared at least one thing in common, and that was concern for discontent and disillusioned Americans who never really came out of the recession. Their economic message was clear – hard-working Americans come first.
Millennials can work inside of both parties to make this the primary message rather than an outlier. Whichever party manages to adjust to millennial priorities will be the one that wins their votes, and Democrats sorely need those votes in coming elections.
There are many reasons why the Democrats lost the election, one of which was the lack of trust of Hillary Clinton.  Her only premise for being on the ticket was to be the fir s t female POTUS, and thank god the voters are too smart to fall for using that premise as their only factor in their decisions.  Dems lost the election, not just for POTUS, but lost seats in the ah I us3, the Senate, governorship and in the local elections.  If there was a conservative  candidate allowed to run for CA Senator against Kamala Harris, that candidate might have won.  
The Democrats are abiut to vote for House Minority Leader and Nancy Pelosi must be not win again.  Same with Sen Chuck Schumer who is running for Senate Minority Leader.  Those folks and their generation of Dem leaders lost the election.  The popular vote and the Electoral College went to Trump because he was able to message correct try his view of the platform.  MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN.  
If you watched 60 Minutes the other night Schumer discussed a few bullet points of their new plan.  It’s not their plan. They are espousing Trump’s plan as their own.  That’s fine but give credit where it’s due.
Lastly, the Democrats are known as the New American Socialist Party.  It is not the party of JFK.  The Dems have been over run bymalt-left social Marxists who want to change this country into someth I ng that it is not and never will be. We are a constitutional republic. Period.
Unfortunately for the party, Barack Obama has been more concerned ab I UT building his personal legacy than working diligently towards the betterment of blacks and the poor in this country.  You cannot be anti America and expect the country to agree.   He was the wrong candidate for the job and by being elected based in the color of his skin and not on his character and a record of accomplishments,  the voters said we will not vote for another candidate based on making that nominee a “first” in some demographic.
Give Trump 4 years to make things happen and we shall see where we are then.  Remember, it took 2 years for Reagan to right the sinking ship of President Carter. It might take a few more this time as BHO has n had 8 years to mess this up.
Fight aon.
Beat the Irish.

Succeeding in school and earning exquisite grades in college is extremely important. However, so is earning real industry experience. We are lucky to attend a school that is known for its networking and social connections. One of our nicknames is even “University of Special Connections.” As students at USC, we all need to take advantage of the variety of resources offered to us because no other school in the nation offers the same amazing opportunities that USC does. I like to think that I am taking advantage of all that USC has to offer, but I also realize that there is so much more I could be doing with my connections. 
I am currently a sophomore at USC. This past summer I was the only person out of all of my friends from home with a paid internship, let alone an internship at all. Most of my friends worked as waiters and lifeguards. Meanwhile, I was working as a social media manager and paid blogger for a beauty company that is headquartered in my hometown, Seattle, Washington. How did I get this internship you may ask? It just so happened that the employee that was in charge of hiring summer interns attended USC herself. My resume was picked out of the bunch because it said that I am a student at USC. 
Fast forward to Fall semester of this year. I am now a public relations and marketing intern for MTV Music Production. How did I find out about this opportunity? Well, as a USC Annenberg student, I receive daily emails that contain information regarding internship opportunities that are related to my major. The internship that I have at MTV was one of the many internships listed on the Annenberg career emails that I received. While I obviously still had to apply for the internship, and send in my resume and cover letter, it was very obvious to me that one of the main reasons that I was able to obtain this position was because of USC. The man that I interviewed with at MTV praised me for being a student at the best journalism and communication school in the country. He shared with me that he had always wanted to attend USC. 
I feel extremely lucky to go to a school that cares about my grades and my future career. I am thankful for the opportunities I have already experienced, thanks to USC, and am excited for internships and jobs that I will be able to experience in the future. I know that I will continue to use the resources that USC has provided me with for the rest of my professional life and as a fellow USC student, so should you.

During last week’s 22nd UN Climate Change Conference, world leaders convened in Morocco to make progress on the commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement. This conference, however, had a new item on the agenda. For the first time, the UN formally responded to the need for a serious consideration of women’s issues to form a gender-responsive global climate change policy, which has mostly been lacking in the conversations regarding policy implementations. 
Climate change, more so than people realize, creates conditions that exacerbate gender inequalities, especially in developing nations. Agricultural communities that rely heavily on predictable weather for cyclical incomes suffer the most devastating hits to their already-inconsistent harvests from temperature increases. This climate insecurity has severe effects on poverty, and in turn, women in particular. For example, in Bangladesh, where extreme weather patterns have caused increases in floods, droughts, and river erosion, greater poverty has led to an environment where impoverished families sometimes have no choice but to marry off their young girls. According to the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to uproot their families from their villages and relocate to the slums of Dhaka. Education in the slums for these “climate-change refugees” is significantly more expensive, and when it comes to schooling, sons are prioritized over daughters. The likelihood that families can afford to educate their girls is slim when funds are limited, and in these scenarios, girls will be married off earlier if they cannot be provided for. In a country where, according to a governmental survey, 65% of women are victims of physical domestic abuse, child marriages create life-threatening risks for young girls who become trapped in dangerous, violent settings with no way out. 
In Africa, where women make up half of the agricultural force, female farmers, compared to their male counterparts, already face productivity challenges due to a lack of resources. Droughts and extreme weather conditions increasingly threaten the health of their crops. Water scarcity and lack of access to clean water means declining standards for women’s hygiene and sanitation, especially affecting maternal health. Women in developing countries have to journey an average of 6 kilometers a day to collect clean water, which means less time spent in school or on productive economic activities. 
We’ve also seen that increasing frequencies of climate-related natural disasters lead to spikes in sexual exploitation and human trafficking. When economic constraints create desperate circumstances, gender-based violence escalates in urban slums and rural areas. 
The disproportionate effects of climate change on women leaves them exposed to unique challenges and vulnerabilities that haven’t been adequately addressed. More research is needed to investigate how climate change is affecting women and girls and how to craft policy that can focus on these issues. There are still not nearly enough women at the table when it comes to the decision-making process for climate change policy; women are a minority among UN delegates. This conference, however, is taking steps in the right direction to tackle these problems.
The Paris Agreement last year had promised to promote “[the equal representation of men and women] in all aspects of the Convention process and for climate action to respond to the differentiated needs, experiences, priorities and capacities of women and men.” In Morocco, Tuesday, November 15, was designated as the conference’s official Gender Day. The Women’s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) announced the release of a new app called the Gender Climate Tracker, in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland and Switzerland and the Global Gender and Climate Alliance. The app aims to “empower decision-makers and advocates alike to translate policies into action and hold governments accountable” by tracking women’s involvement and participation numbers in climate diplomacy, as well as “compiling policies, mandates, research, decisions and actions related to gender and climate change.” 
Our international response to climate change must promote human rights and empower women and girls. It is crucial that the steps taken in last week’s UN conference and the Paris Agreement are translated into concrete gender-responsive actions and inclusion of women decision-makers in the implementation of the policy that will protect the health of our planet.
