Several days have passed since Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer was given a three-game suspension for his mishandling of domestic abuse allegations against a former assistant coach, a verdict that reflects negatively upon the entire sports world.
There was evidence revealed in an investigation conducted by the university that Meyer — who won the national championship at Ohio State in the 2014 season and is up next to Alabama’s Nick Saban among the elite coaches in college football — failed to act in 2015 upon allegations that Zach Smith, the former assistant coach, assaulted his now ex-wife Courtney Smith. There were the lies that Meyer spewed during Big Ten media day in July, when he pretended he knew nothing of Smith’s past, despite his history of questionable behavior. And there was the fact that, as the story went public earlier this month, Meyer asked a staffer how to delete old text messages. Curiously, when investigators went through Meyer’s phone, they found no texts dating back longer than a year. 
But worst of all, following his suspension last Wednesday, Meyer held a press conference and delivered a pathetic performance. He was unapologetic, unremorseful — seemingly offended that he was even in this situation. He could not even bring himself to mention Courtney Smith’s name or talk about her until near the end of the presser.
“I have a message for everyone involved in this,” he said when a reporter finally asked if he had a message for Smith. “I’m sorry that we are in this situation. I’m just sorry we are in this situation.”
That was it. 
On Friday, in the face of public backlash, Meyer finally released a statement online apologizing to Smith and her children. But Wednesday’s presser revealed more about Meyer’s character than an after-the-fact apology. He couldn’t say her name out loud, couldn’t even apologize to her. Instead, he said “we,” like she, the victim, was at fault. It was as if, Smith just had inconvenienced him because he was now facing repercussions for covering up domestic abuse by one of his former employees when there were important football games to prepare for.
By slapping Meyer on the wrist with a three-game suspension, Ohio State is sending the message that winning football games is more important than taking the moral high ground. The university had two options for two scenarios with its investigation: Clear him of wrongdoing and not punish him at all, or find fault and fire him. It found fault, and then did nothing. There is no middle ground when it comes to domestic violence or any type of  mistreatment. There is no amount of games — let alone three — that Meyer should miss that will atone for the abuse that Courtney Smith went through, abuse that he took no action to stop.
It’s sad is that this comes as no surprise. We have seen this type of story time and time again in sports, where prominent athletes or coaches are given a pass because the value of their contributions to the team supersedes the desire to do right by survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence. 
This has to change. Brandon McCarthy, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves who is active on social issues, tweeted about the hypocrisy of sports fans who are willing to accept their star players retiring but keep rooting for their favorite player even in the face of negative revelations.
“Sports fans are used to the loss of their favorites and are always excited to see what’s next,” McCarthy wrote last Wednesday. “Why doesn’t this apply when their favorites turn out to be bad people?”
I am not passing judgement on whether or not Meyer is a bad person. I am saying that based on what we know, he should not be the head football coach at Ohio State. But that is not up to me, or anyone else who thinks this situation is outrageous. It is up to people within the university and determined by the culture surrounding Ohio State. Apparently, the culture of football, of bringing in money from winning games, of satisfying boosters and donors and the fanbase took precedence over showing contrition for a victim. 
We may never hear Courtney Smith’s name again. But we will hear all about how Meyer’s legacy was tarnished and how the Buckeyes will carry on for three games without their head coach, as if this “adversity” is even in the same stratosphere as what Smith went through.
And let’s not pretend for a second that this exact scenario wouldn’t play out the same way at any other big-time college football program. College sports isn’t about doing what is morally right. The NCAA insists on its athletes being amateurs so it can profit off their success. College athletics are about one thing: making money. Urban Meyer does that for Ohio State, so he gets to keep his job. And as a sports fan, that makes me sad.

The USC women’s volleyball team won the 2018 Trojan Invitational on Saturday night with three straight victories against No. 4  Kentucky, Northern Iowa and No. 14 Creighton, as new head coach Brent Crouch earned his first three wins as a Trojan.
Crouch was previously the head coach at Portland, where he led the Pilots from a winless season to their best season in 25 years and earned the 2016 West Coast Conference Coach of the Year. He now has the tough task of replacing ex-coach Mick Haley. Even more challenging is that the Trojans are a very young team, with only three seniors on the roster.
“I have wanted to coach, and teach, and compete at the absolute highest level I can, and USC has the same vision,” Crouch said in a press release. “So, the pressure of winning and getting to Final Fours and winning the whole deal is something that I was already putting on myself. USC is ambitious and so am I, so that was a nice fit.” 
Crouch and the Trojans faced an immediate challenge in the opener against Kentucky. The first set saw 14 ties, but Kentucky finished with a 3-0 run to win 25-22. It appeared as if USC’s inexperience was beginning to show when her team fell behind 7-0 in the second set, but sophomore outside hitter Brooke Botkin  and junior outside hitters Emily Baptista and Khalia Lanier combined for 20 kills to win 25-22 and even the match. 
In her first game after transferring from University of the Pacific, Baptista looked sharp with five more kills in the third set as USC narrowly won 25-23. She then recorded six more kills in the final frame as USC and Kentucky went back and forth before the Trojans pulled away to win 29-27. Botkin finished with a game-high 18 kills, while freshman setter Raquel Lázaro, a Spanish native, had an outstanding debut with 55 assists.
With momentum gained from the upset against the Wildcats, USC was clearly much more confident and aggressive from the onset against Northern Iowa. Though each set was close (27-25, 25-23, 25-20), USC looked poised throughout and didn’t succumb to the pressure, a promising sign for Crouch to build upon. Lanier posted her first double-double of the year with 11 kills and 10 digs, while Botkin contributed eight kills. Junior middle blocker Madison Murtagh also had a career high of seven kills and one block. 
The final game against Creighton was a long one, with the Trojans pulling out an 18-16 win in the fifth frame to take home the championship. USC survived 3 straight points in the opening set before coming out on top after a Creighton attack error. However, a Trojan attack error set up Creighton to take the second set 25-23. Botkin continued her dominant play with seven kills to fend off a late push by the Blue Jays, who trailed 20-14 midway, to win the third set, 25-22. The back-and-forth continued in the fourth set before Creighton rattled off 5 straight points to give themselves some distance and eventually force a final game. USC had 3 match point chances before Lanier delivered a pair of consecutive kills to seal the victory. 
Lázaro recorded her first double-double with 53 assists and 22 digs, while Botkin finished with 25 kills and 12 digs. USC and Creighton hit just .219 and .184, respectively. 
USC (3-0) now travels to the Sunshine State for the Bubly Water Invitational in Gainesville, Fla., where the Trojans will play the tournament-host Florida Gators on Friday evening. They will finish out the tournament by facing UCF and Louisville.

The women’s soccer team continued its red-hot start to the season with resounding victories against Cal Poly and Pepperdine over the weekend, improving its record to 3-0.
The Women of Troy claimed their second victory of the season on Friday as they defeated Cal Poly 6-1. While the performance was far from perfect, the Trojans showed many glimpses of why they are one of the best teams in the country.
“I like the way we started the game, I liked the intensity, I liked the way our forwards finished in the first half,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after Friday’s win. “I wanted a little bit more out of the second half, but it’s hard to sustain that mentally. My expectations are greater, but overall a great day. [I] got to see a lot of players play, so I thought for the most part it was good.”
The scoring frenzy started with senior forward Leah Pruitt, who played one of her best games for the Trojans to date. She scored 2 goals within the first 10 minutes of the game and assisted on one later in the game. Pruitt looked phenomenal on the ball, dribbling past the goalie for both her goals, showing composure on the ball and magnificent touch. While the Trojans have many high caliber players on the team, Pruitt’s performances will be key this season if they look to make it far in the NCAA tournament.
“I think it was really awesome how we came out and scored a lot of goals early,”  Pruitt said. “I try to stay composed when I’m close to the goal and I saw the goalie coming out and it worked both times.”
Redshirt junior forward Natalie Jacobs also claimed a goal from the penalty spot to make it 3-0 within 10 minutes. The remaining goals came from sophomore midfielder Tara McKeown, junior right-back Ashleigh Plumptre and freshman striker Penelope Hocking.
Although she didn’t claim a goal against Cal Poly, redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo also contributed to the win. Most of the midfield play went through DeMelo, who had a strong touch in her game against the Mustangs.
The Women of Troy carried their momentum into Sunday by routing Pepperdine 5-0. This was quite an impressive feat for the Trojans as the Waves had not allow a goal at home in over 900 minutes of play dating back to last season.
After the first half, the game seemed close as the Trojans were only leading 1-0, courtesy of a goal from DeMelo following a great linkage of play, including a brilliant cross into the box by McKeown and a good pass from Plumptre to allow DeMelo to simply tap it into the bottom corner of the goal.
The goals just seemed to flow in the second half as DeMelo scored another goal from the penalty spot following a foul on Jacobs that led to her exit from the game. Additionally, freshman forward Penelope Hocking showed great composure as she put another one past the goalie to make the score 3-0. Hocking has looked impressive coming off the bench in her last two games for the Trojans. McKeown got in on the scoring party as she put away the fourth goal for the Trojans after beating two defenders on the dribble and putting away a hard, low shot. The Women of Troy were gifted their 5th goal after a Waves’ defender headed the ball into her own net to give the Trojans a 5-0 lead and put the game out of reach.
The Women of Troy looked impressive this weekend and certainly look like a top team after having scored 11 goals in two games. They haven’t scored more than 4 goals in a game since 2014 when the Trojans put 9 goals past Arkansas Pine-Bluff. Now, the Trojans have scored 5 or more in two consecutive games, and both against defensively sound teams. While in years past the Trojans’ strong suit has been defense, this season they look to have found an offensive groove.
The Trojans will travel to No. 5 Florida State in their next game on Friday which will quickly be followed by a trip to No. 6 Florida on Sunday — two high-profile matchups that will test the team.

Nicki Minaj’s latest album “Queen” debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Travis Scott’s “Astroworld,” which held onto its No. 1 position for the second straight week. Minaj, in an angry tirade, took to Twitter on Aug. 19 to call out everyone — Scott, his girlfriend Kylie Jenner, Billboard, Spotify and even her own record label — for what she perceived was an active effort to dethrone her album’s predestined debut at No. 1. 
According to her, Scott cheated by selling merchandise and presale tickets to his “Wish You Were Here” tour bundled with a digital album download, and Jenner cheated by promoting the bundles on her Instagram and hinting that fans had the chance to catch her and their child Stormi on tour. As for Billboard’s role, the rapper felt that it failed to properly calculate the number of sales for which the bundles should count. She also blamed Spotify for not promoting her album on the company’s platform to the extent that it pushed Drake’s “Scorpion,” and she expressed that her label did not retaliate in fear that the platform would bury label-mate Ariana Grande’s “Sweetener.”
I, for one, am of the opinion that Minaj’s rage was misplaced. Both she, Scott and a multitude of other artists have offered their fans album bundles featuring merchandise and tour tickets from it — Scott merely benefited more from it in this instance. Spotify’s coverage of “Scorpion” was unprecedented, so much that the company had to dole out free subscriptions to placate upset users. Both Spotify and her label have no financial incentive to under-promote a project from one of their highest-earning artists. It’s simple: Scott played today’s battle for the charts and won.
Behind all of the Internet drama surrounding “Queen” and “Astroworld” poses some very real, albeit unsettling, questions: What the heck is a record sale in 2018? Do they even matter anymore?
Ever since Napster’s initial launch in 1999, when peer-to-peer file sharing took over the internet in a major way, the music industry has been grappling with the demise of record sales. Music distributors struggled to keep up with the times and started losing money. In the United States, annual revenues for music distribution fell from $14.6 billion in 1999 to $6.3 billion in 2009. Touring, merchandise and endorsements were still profitable, but there was very little financial incentive for records themselves.
Fast forward to 2018, a vastly different time in which the music industry is making more money than it has in years and streaming has become its largest revenue source. Earlier this year, Billboard finalized changes for how streams would be weighted for its Hot 100 songs chart and Hot 200 albums chart since streaming has become the dominant metric in measuring commercial in music. Now, the U.S. charts are based on sales (both physical and digital), radio play and online streaming, with 1,500 streams equating to one album unit sold. These new rules reflect fundamental changes in the ways we have consumed music since the rise of the internet in the late-20th century, a far cry from the stranglehold CDs and cassettes held on music distribution in the ’90s.
Furthermore, the change in record sales standards has produced some puzzling results. In July, Drake’s “Scorpion” broke several landmark records on Billboard on its way to No. 1. Under these new rules, Drake broke his own record of most singles simultaneously charting in the Hot 100 with 27, including “Scorpion’s” entire 25-song tracklist. As well, seven of these songs cracked the top 10, breaking The Beatles’ record of five songs simultaneously in the top 10 that has stood since 1964. This brought his career total of top 10-charting songs to 31, edging out Michael Jackson for the most ever.
Are these records deserved? Maybe. Of course, as any critic or hardcore music fan will tell you, “Scorpion” undoubtedly lacks the cultural significance or lasting power of The Beatles’ or Michael Jackson’s early singles, but his records and accolades will only grow. And according to today’s industry standards for quantifying sales and popularity, both Drake and Travis Scott are playing the system to their advantage.
My advice to Minaj comes from an old adage I learned from Ice-T: Don’t hate the player, hate the game. And the industry today says that T-shirts, tour tickets and bizarre streaming rules are the game, so artists have no choice but to start playing.

Most people don’t think much about sleep; it’s a seemingly natural part of life.  But Eric Plant, a sophomore at the School of Cinematic Arts and aspiring Roski scholar, knows all too well about sleep, dreams and the fantasy worlds borne in the night.
On Aug. 25, the artist created an environment called “Liminal Spaces,” where reality met dreamscape. Inspired by personal experiences with insomnia and vivid dreams, Plant first decided to pursue the idea for the exhibit after discovering that many like them were going through the same things. 
“I noticed that this was a trend, so I wanted to explore that more and what that feels like and hopefully capture that experience in a show,” Plant said. 
They wanted visitors to be in a space that didn’t quite emulate slumber or consciousness but rather, a “surreal middleground” trapped between the two states, regardless of whether people have experienced similar sleep episodes. The exhibit began with a poem written by Plant and their friend Justice Schiappa. The two then formed the other pieces surrounding the poem, in collaboration with fellow USC students Evan Siegal, Reanna Cruz and Schiappa. 
Within the installation, every  artist showcased identified was a person of color and/or identified as queer. Aside from the written poem, a multitude of mediums filled the space, including film, photographs and music. Each of Plant’s friends contributed to the pieces to create a surrealist world. The room was complete with floating pillows suspended over a bed, symbolizing the separation of mind and body in sleep. A hanging white sheet with a video of a girl smoking represented the state of being trapped in reality with the release (through smoking) of being asleep. 
“I’ve always been into using  different mediums creatively,” Plant said. “When I do art, I don’t like to use one style only. For example, if I do photography, I like to incorporate a sculpture to go along with it. I think using various mediums at once and showing different dimensions of a subject makes a bigger impact on how you experience it.”
With strong use of primary colors as well as black and white elements throughout the installation, Plant transformed the depiction of sleep as a mundane act to a full-blown vivid dream. Yet, because of their sleep deprivation and insomnia, these aspects created a liminal space among people constantly on the brink of descending  into a dream state. 
“I wanted to have the life of [a dream], but still keep it grounded in sleep,” Plant said. “Someone would recognize that there’s a strong presence of black and white yet also acknowledge that there is more life to it with the use of color in the space.” 
With “Liminal Spaces,” Plant hopes viewers felt as if  they were elsewhere, suspended in limbo, while in the exhibition space.  
“I want to give people an experience that they typically don’t get, like a feeling of being trapped or like you can’t escape while in the midst of your attempt to sleep,” Plant said. “I think art installations are they best way to get an experience of different art mediums solidified in one place.” 
An impressive and eye-opening showcase, “Liminal Spaces” displays Plant’s phenomenal grasp on the versatility of the human mind and the ethereality of both reality and dreams. Though the show was only open for one night, Plant plans to put on many more exhibitions throughout the year, and they hope to collaborate with other USC artists in the future.

Last Friday, four of USC’s improvisation troupes came together to show new students what they can do with a suggestion and comedy chops. The audience chuckled as The Merry Men, Spoiler Alert, Second Nature and Commedus Interruptus played traditional improv games and put on episodic sketches. 
The Merry Men, the first group up, played common theatre games. Despite their small size, the group put on an entertaining show. Though Merry Men currently consists only of men, they said they welcome female performers as well. 
Spoiler Alert, which has long-form episodic comedy in addition to theatre games, performed next. At a suggestion from the crowd, they put on an “episode” of “Mineshaft,” a horror show featuring characters with wild accents and plenty of phallic jokes. The group finished their set with a game of Blaze, a line game in which a player draws comedia parallels between their gender and an object suggested by the audience.
Second Nature, a quirky troupe, also featured more of a long-form style in their performances.  However, instead of taking a title and a genre for their suggestions, they took three words on Friday: Flip, prep and Arizona. 
Last to go was USC’s oldest troupe, Commedus Interruptus. They played  theatre games Four Points and I Like My, to groans from some audience members. 
Preliminary auditions for all four of the troupes will take place Sept. 14-15.

Blood Orange’s fourth studio album “Negro Swan” was released Friday. The LP is a continuation of the electronica and experimental R&B production Hynes has been fine-tuning since his musical start. (Photo courtesy of Domino Recording Company)
There is no doubt that Dev Hynes is one of the most innovative songwriters and producers of his generation. Under the moniker Blood Orange, he has found idiosyncratic ways to explore his identity and sexuality as a black man, though often taking a melancholic approach. Hynes’ latest LP, “Negro Swan,” is a continuation of the electronica and experimental R&B productions he has been working on since becoming Blood Orange ten years ago. The result is some of his best work to date. The album is both self-aware and self-assured; it is poignant in its lyrical themes, with incredibly polished productions. “Negro Swan” showcases an artist at his peak and, finally, Blood Orange has mastered the balancing of pain and hope.
“Negro Swan” is so sonically cohesive that transitions are almost indiscernible. Written and produced almost entirely independently, Blood Orange ponders the notion of self-love in the modern age. He told Dazed Digital this album was “an exploration into my own and many types of black depression… and the ongoing anxieties of queer/people of color.” He explores these themes by organically interweaving spoken word and poetry into the songs, which are performed by artists such as transgender activist Janet Mock and hip-hop mogul Diddy. In the introduction of the song “Jewelry,” Mock says, “People try to put us down by saying ‘She’s doing the most,’ or ‘he’s way too much,’” before asking, “but, like, why would we want to do the least?” 
The poetic sentiment becomes a window into Blood Orange’s mind and perspective. The one main difference between “Negro Swan” and his last album “Freetown Sound” is the straightforwardness of his lyrics, which he accredits to his expanding audience. “It made me be maybe a little more direct in what I’m saying,” he said to Pitchfork — and he has. Never before as Blood Orange been more vulnerable or relatable. 
Despite the sonic cohesiveness, the album encompasses many genres, ranging from gospel on “Holy Will” with soul singer Ian Isiah, to indie hip-hop on “Chewing Gum” which features a verse from rapper A$AP Rocky.  The diverse genres provide a way for him to enhance the different themes explored in his lyrics by giving each feeling a distinct sound. The production on “Holy Will” is reminiscent of church choirs and the lyrics speak of cleansing oneself after having sinned the night before. 
As the album slides through the various genres, Hynes explores the themes of isolation and displacement, but also his own methods of escaping. On the track “Nappy Wonder,” he sings “Dreaming of the place / bring myself away / like in barking days,” in the chorus he continues, “feelings never have been ethical / feelings never had no ethics (always feeling).” “This time it’s more explicitly about skateboarding — just the escapism that I found through skating through the years, even now,” he said to Pitchfork.  
On “Chewing Gum” he uses sexual metaphors to explain what it is exactly he is escaping from — the exhaustiveness of constantly being outraged and feisty. . In the chorus, he sings “looking for the truth, for the truth, looking for the truth for the truth / tell me what you want from me.”  
“Negro Swan” is both the past, present and future of music, representing and paying homage to creatives who came before Hynes and inspired his sound, including Diddy. Simultaneously, the album remains socially relevant with themes of black liberation and sexuality paired with innovative productions that challenge the genres of pop and R&B. This album is Blood Orange at his peak; luckily for his fans, Hynes seems like he has more exploring to do.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
“Something there is that doesn’t love a wall.” Such begins “Mending Wall,” a widely known and often analyzed poem by 20th-century writer Robert Frost. Focusing on two New England farmers who separate their properties — and subsequently their personal lives — by building a stone wall, Frost’s poem questions whether good fences really do make “good neighbors.” And, for many curious readers, the poem calls something equally important — especially to this column — into question as well: What is the “something” that doesn’t love a wall?
My answer, however plain it may seem, can be summed up in just one word: love. 
As I’ve come to understand them, humans have a destructive habit of protecting themselves, of building walls in places where bridges should be formed. These walls exist all around us: as in “Mending Wall,” sometimes they exist between people. Particularly relevant to the realm of mental health and to “Mindful Mondays” as a whole, sometimes they exist within ourselves. And while these seemingly impenetrable boundaries appear to block out the bad, so too do they block out the good.
At USC, it’s no secret that the University really does love walls. An observation fairly obvious to any student who calls the campus home, the University’s extensive network of security checkpoints — physical walls, in a sense — has shut out the very community with which it claims to identify. Perhaps more relevant to this discussion, however, are the metaphorical walls that shut out the very Trojan Family it claims to welcome.
In this case, as I attempt to frame an understanding of USC’s relationship with its students, an overused yet all-too-relevant cliché comes to mind: “Money can’t buy love.” In other words, no matter how many Villages or Starbucks it builds, the University cannot create a thriving student body unless it loves its students; money can buy a fancy house but not necessarily a home. 
I touched upon this topic last April in one of my articles, which detailed my experience as I tried, and failed, to find counseling in the Engemann Student Health Center. After it received numerous complaints similar to mine, the Provost’s office promised to improve the efficiency of its floundering system.
But based on its track record, I’m not entirely sure that the health center will. Over the years, USC has done a commendable job creating a school that ostensibly prioritizes wellness only to look the other way when students try to reach out for help — and I have no reason to believe the University won’t do the same this time around. That’s why, to some extent, students must learn how to count on themselves. 
And that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. After all, the first step toward wellness must be taken by the individual; circling back to the central theme of love, confronting one’s personal issues requires at least some degree of self-love — a concept that, more and more recently, has unfortunately been watered down to staying hydrated and applying face masks. So, as they transition into a time of independence, students need to realize that recognizing one’s mental health concerns, making lifestyle changes and reaching out for help (albeit outside of USC services) are actually the mature, responsible things to do.
Students also need to realize, however, that they must extend that love to their peers. That means actually discussing mental health problems instead of using them as the punchline for jokes; of course, being transparent about one’s personal issues becomes much easier when the listening party is welcoming and receptive. It also means taking the extra step to check on friends during times of need — a simple text or phone call can truly go a long way for someone who feels their cries for help consistently fall on deaf ears. 
In a sense, “Mindful Mondays” is my own show of support — of love — for students who feel trapped within the confines of walls built by fear and insecurity. Moving into the new semester, I hope the University will learn to love its students, but more importantly, I hope students will learn to love themselves. And if I’ve made only a chip in those walls by the end of this, then I’ve done my job.

Despite the digital connectivity that sets this generation apart from its predecessors, it’s sadly ironic that loneliness is one of the most profound concerns of the modern age. 
Tinder, a dating app in which users swipe through profiles to match with each other, announced Wednesday the launch of “Tinder U,” a feature that allows university students to create Tinder profiles with their university emails and give preference to those of students at the same school. 
Tinder, of course, made sure to suggest that its app is not only intended to help students find romance: “Need a study buddy? Not a problem. Coffee date on the quad? We’ve got you covered. Freshman year and you don’t know a soul? This is your ticket to the coolest crowd on campus. Let’s face it — it doesn’t get any classier than this,” reads its online announcement. 
Younger people are now raised with countless resources to make their lives easier. We don’t need to go looking for friends and partners, for example, because they will come to us thanks to services like Tinder. As such, overall loneliness should be lower, not higher. But to what extent is this true?
Over half of all Americans feel that they are alone at least sometimes, based on a survey of 20,000 adults by health insurer Cigna. The survey also found that 54 percent of respondents said they feel like nobody actually knows them well. And another 56 percent said they feel that the people they surround themselves with are “not necessarily with them.” And in the final of several startling statistics, roughly 40 percent said they “lack companionship,” their “relationships aren’t meaningful,” and that they feel “isolated from others.”
While there are certainly many concerning numbers, here is the most revealing part of study: Young Americans, who practically come out of the womb with an iPhone and make Instagram profiles more commonly than they renew passports, are more likely to consider themselves lonely. These statistics should not be taken lightly. According to a 2017 review from the American Psychological Association, loneliness and isolation significantly increase the risk of premature mortality. In a survey of nearly four million people, the researchers discovered that lonely people had a 50 percent increased risk of death before age 70 when compared to their peers with good social connections. People who are socially isolated have a higher risk of early death than people who are obese, and have a 30 percent increase in their risk of death before age 70.  
“Gen Z,” the generation born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s, reports the highest level of loneliness, followed by millennials. Previous generations reported loneliness at lower rates than the national average. So while students can thank Tinder for brilliantly filtering its users to students at our campus through the unveiling of Tinder U, we must also take a step back and consider whether this app is fixing — or contributing to — the loneliness epidemic among young people.
The widely cited benefit of social media and modern-day apps is that they allow people to stay connected, but they may not have all the positive qualities that consumers previously thought were true. There does not seem to be much of a point to bringing people together if the result is loneliness. There’s a clear paradox here. 
In the 21st century, where we can order a pizza and have it delivered with only minimal interaction with the delivery guy, where we can conduct research without leaving the confines of our dorm and where we can allegedly meet our soulmate without ever having to meet them in person, the fire of initiative lacks fuel. 
Instead of being connected by “the cloud,” it appears that a cloud of loneliness is instead hovering over us. Tinder U presents itself as a way to connect, but it may only result in further isolation.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced three graduate students as the USC Center on Public Diplomacy fellows for the academic year.

Graduate students Austin Maddox, Nicole Burnett and Katherine Butler from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism were announced as new USC Center on Public Diplomacy student fellows for the academic year. Along with their studies, the fellows will work within the journalism, public diplomacy and public relation sectors at CPD to contribute to digital platforms, research and strategy. 
Maddox, who is pursuing a Master of Science in journalism, will be working at CPD as a journalism fellow. Throughout the year, she will develop CPD’s website and create interactive, accessible assets for those who are unfamiliar with the school’s program. In addition to reporting on USC’s involvement in global public diplomacy, she will also craft videos to highlight current news in public diplomacy.
“I’m so excited to begin my fellowship with the Center on Public Diplomacy,” Maddox said. “I’m excited to bring more video content that will help spread the word about the great things that USC is doing to further public engagement. I’m really grateful that this department is embracing technology’s different ways that stories can be told.”
Burnett, who is studying in the Master of Public Diplomacy program, will develop and promote CPD projects. She will mainly work with CPD Director Jay Wang and the center’s publications and research teams. She will manage online and social media content. 
“One thing I have been involved with so far is adding to its PD Hub,” Burnett wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “CPD frequently adds to this virtual classroom, which includes a repository of public diplomacy resources such as books, articles and multimedia content.” 
Butler, who is pursuing a Master of Arts in strategic public relations, will directly manage the center’s digital presence, reviewing analytics and other metrics of its website and social media accounts. She will brainstorm ideas on how to best disseminate the center’s mission statement across different platforms. 
The program’s goal is to recruit the best students to USC, according to the CPD website. It provides funding for graduate students developing, conducting and promoting the department’s projects.
“CPD provides a wide range of beyond-the-classroom learning opportunities at the intersection of communication and global affairs,” Wang said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The student fellowship program is one of our platforms where students can expand their horizons and further their careers. The need for international perspectives and exposure in today’s world is greater than ever.”
Maddox plans to use her previous experience at Sony Pictures Television Diverse Directors Program and for Terry Hines and Associates’ multicultural public relations branch to guide her through her fellowship. During Maddox’s five months at Sony, she was tasked with adding more diversity to the director’s space. She was able to interact with many minority directors and view independent films. At Terry Hines, she marketed films to Latinx and black audiences. 
“After I graduate, I would love to make short-form documentary pieces for the digital space … working with online publications to make their video content, doing on-camera interviews and making content for young people that is entertaining but also informative,” Maddox said. “I want to work with content that reflects the intersection between popular culture, politics and social issues.”
Burnett had a previous internship with communications firm CLS Strategies, where she was hired as a full-time associate and then promoted to a senior associate role. According to Burnett, she worked on several client account teams to create and carry out communications strategies, primarily involved with the firm’s crisis and litigation sector. During her four years at CLS, Burnett said that she became familiar with communications strategy, media relations and fast-paced work environments and hopes to utilize these skills at CPD this year.
“I am particularly excited to learn new skills and apply them to a real-world setting,” Burnett wrote. “CPD, and USC generally, has so many training opportunities to become familiar with programs like those in the Adobe Creative Cloud and those used for website and social media management.” 
Before coming to USC, Butler gained professional experience within the public relations field. She worked at a startup public relations firm RISE Creative that was a branding company for ethical fashion groups. Butler focused on influencer outreach by brainstorming places to distribute products and creating connections with larger companies. She later worked with the Virginia House of Delegates campaign to further her interest in politics and public relations. 
“I want to really grow and feel comfortable with working in public diplomacy,” Butler said. “After USC, I have not yet decided on what route I would like to go in, but I am definitely considering something on a world-wide scale, which is why public diplomacy is so appealing to me.”
Butler is also interested in working for a corporate communications firm or representing a company where she can work in public relations.

Alumna Gabriela Gomes created the game to help patients suffering from diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease. The game has been tested at 10 retirement communities so far. (Photo courtesy of Gabriela Gomes)
When the time came to write her MFA thesis in USC’s Interactive Media program, alumna Gabriela Gomes had no idea where she wanted her career to go. She sat down and wrote a list of things that were important to her. One in particular stood out: family.
“I found myself thinking about how we care for our elders and loved ones who might be going through a healing process,” Gomes said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I thought about my own grandparents, and in particular, one of my grandmothers who had a form of dementia in the latest years of her life. She has lost the ability to connect with the world around her, to her family and friends and so my goal was to design a tool I wish I had access to while she was still alive.”
With this in mind, Gomes created “Healing Spaces,” a multi-sensory experience meant to help people suffering from neurodegenerative illnesses like dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease. The goal of the project was to create an immersive experience that would improve caregiving for patients.
“I started doing a lot of research on existing literature and interventions, trying to identify challenges I could potentially try to solve with the skills I had developed during my MFA,” Gomes wrote. “This is when I came across the research on multi-sensory environments, which was really the starting point for Healing Spaces.”
The game requires only four components: a television screen, speakers, hue lights and an iPad. 
“Ultimately, ‘Healing Spaces’ is really about creating restorative environments where one is given the opportunity to set aside their anxieties, and find the time to reconnect with themselves, their surroundings or their loved ones, wherever it might be,” Gomes said. 
The app allows patients to transcend their typical medical setting and be transported to one of two different scenes: a beach or forest. According to USC News, Gomes added a sensory box, which includes items like sand, along with an aromatherapy element. Gomes hopes that with these items, players will find it easier to relax and communicate with their caregivers.
“Caregiving is very challenging, especially when it comes to finding a balance between self-care and caring for a loved one,” Gomes wrote. “Although we obviously had therapeutic goals in mind for those being cared for, ‘Healing Spaces’ was also designed to help caregivers find a moment of respite in their busy and often stressful lives, and to help foster meaningful moments of connection through play.”
But Gomes’ project is not only making waves in the healthcare industry — the game is also changing the role of video games as a whole. Gomes presented her creation at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo.
“I think that when people come to these sort of events, they have certain expectations,” Gomes said. “They want to play a polished demo, they want to know how you’re monetizing and distributing your work. And I just had a proof-of-concept, fresh out of university.”
While the demo was out of the ordinary for an event like E3, Gomes said she enjoyed presenting an alternative to the typical E3 demography. 
Prior to joining USC’s MFA in Interactive Media program in 2015, Gomes was interested in exploring the intersection of art, science and technology. For her, the School of Cinematic Arts was the ideal environment to grow and to be inspired for collaborative and multidisciplinary design approaches. 
Now, “Healing Spaces” has had trial runs in one retirement community. Gomes is motivated to start a second pilot to better understand to what extent the game is successful in helping reduce agitation and increasing engagement among older adults living with advanced dementia. 
“I have a lot of ideas of where the project could go, but for now, I’m focusing more on refining the experiences we currently have,” Gomes said. “There’s still a lot more to explore when it comes to different interaction and play patterns before we think about expansion.”

Recognizing the challenges classical music faces in a rapidly evolving music industry, the USC Thornton Classical Performance and Composition Division is working to prepare a new educational model for students in 2019. 
“The way music is being composed, performed, listened to and experienced in performance have changed significantly in the past 50 years,” Lisa Sylvester, the school’s vocal arts and opera chair, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “In order to prepare our students to enter into the professional world, we must adapt some of our teaching methods and content to address these changes.” 
The updated program allows students to pursue other interests beyond their major focus and provides the option of adding a minor.
“The key thing here is that we were able to provide greater flexibility without compromising the rigor of our program,” Lucinda Carver, vice dean of the Division of Classical Performance and Composition, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Students who want to apply their musical backgrounds in career areas beyond the concert hall have the opportunity to explore classes that will help them do so. Looking at courses outside of Thornton gives students an avenue to combine their interests and have a well-rounded education.
“We have people who are wanting to work with brains and dealing with stroke patients and music,” winds and percussion chair Kristy Morrell said. “They would have to take some of their electives clearly in neuroscience or perhaps gerontology … They would network with those particular professions and that faculty and put together their project.” 
Another key feature to the program is the addition of the Young Artists Project. Tailored to each student, the project is based on classical performance classes taken during students’ freshman and sophomore years. Throughout their college careers, Thornton scholars will build relationships with faculty who will advise and guide their projects. 
“It is our plan to have ongoing conversations with the students from the time they begin as freshmen about possible project ideas so that there is time for exploration — either in the classes they take or in outside activities,” Sylvester said. 
Students will combine lessons  from outside non-major elective classes with the skills they learn at Thornton. In their junior year, they will take a formal class to help them determine the direction they want their project to take.
By the end of that year, they will have a faculty committee assembled that will help them oversee and implement their project, which will take place in the fall semester of their senior year, according to Carver.
The new curriculum focuses on eight tenets to create well-rounded musicians: developing musical excellence, connecting scholarship to music making, interrogating the relevance of music to a diverse and inclusive society, erasing performance boundaries between different genres of music, navigating their way into the music profession to monetize their skills, mastering skills to share music through digital platforms and non-traditional venues, building a lifelong, global professional network and leading a healthy life as a musician. 
“In the learning institution, why not teach them everything they need to know?” Morell said. “You may not really understand the importance of injury prevention and living a healthy lifestyle … but it’s a great time to start because you can establish healthy habits.” 
Other focuses include preparing student musicians to think globally and learn from cultures outside of their own. 
“Successful classical musicians are citizens of the world,” said Brian Head, the assistant dean for academic programs. “This has been true for generations and is even more so today. It is imperative that our students see themselves this way from the start.”
According to Head, one of the ways students can engage with the worldwide music sphere is through technology. By teaching students to master technological advances for performance and distribution, they can gain a bigger audience in the future. 
“Classical music is now performed and consumed through the prism of technology,” Head said. “The new program gives classical students the room to become technologically savvy — in recording, pedagogy, distribution, etc. — so that they can use technology powerfully as professionals.”
With the arrival of a revamped curriculum, the classical music department hopes to continue to inspire excellence in its students.
“This is such an exciting time for them,” Morell said. “They can do anything literally with entrepreneurial skills, networking, and they’re already tremendously bright and passionate and they’re virtuosic players.”

True freshman JT Daniels has been named the starting quarterback for the Trojans football team, head coach Clay Helton announced Sunday.
He will be the second Trojan in history starting behind center to open the season as a true freshman, after Matt Barkley started against San Jose State in 2009. This decision comes after weeks of a three-way battle for the starting spot between Daniels, redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink. 
“We had a very healthy quarterback competition this year with four incredible young men,” Helton said. “All are tremendous people, teammates and football players.  In the end, JT Daniels has earned the starting position and will be the starter against UNLV.  As you can imagine [Daniels] was excited when we let him know, but his uncanny maturity kept him focused on what is next.”
Daniels has been lauded as a phenom since his time at Mater Dei High School. Daniels’ high school career ended a year early due to his choice to reclassify into the class of 2018. He is only the second player in USC history to reclassify in order to graduate from high school a year early, the first being John David Booty in 2003.
In his final year of football at Mater Dei, Daniels averaged 274.9 yards, 3.5 touchdowns and 17.5 completions per game. His efforts on the turf helped to lead Mater Dei to the 2017 California State Open Division championship. Following his 2017 season, he was awarded the 2017-18 Gatorade High School Male Athlete of the Year. 
“I am honored that Coach Helton picked me as the starter,” Daniels said. “I understand this it is a huge responsibility and I need to work hard to be prepared to handle it. It was a tight competition between all the quarterbacks throughout camp.  We pushed each other every day.  I felt that Coach’s decision wouldn’t be wrong whoever he picked.” 
The decision to start Daniels the first week came as a surprise to some who felt Helton would select Fink, the only quarterback on the roster with collegiate experience. Fink appeared in three games last fall, completing six of his nine attempted passes. 
Daniels will have big shoes to fill as he replaces Sam Darnold, who led the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory in his first season as a redshirt freshman and secured a Pac-12 Championship in his second season. Darnold was drafted by the New York Jets in this year’s NFL Draft. 
USC enters the season ranked No. 15 and will host UNLV at the Coliseum on Sept. 1.
