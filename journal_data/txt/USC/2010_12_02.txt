Third Eye Blind will perform at this year’s Conquest today, USC’s annual rally before the game against UCLA on Saturday.
The event, sponsored by USC Student Affairs, will kick off at 4 p.m. in McCarthy Quad.
There will also be performances from the Trojan Marching Band, the USC Song Girls, Spirit Leaders, Trojan Dance Force.
Third Eye Blind is popular for songs such as “Jumper” and “Semi-Charmed Life.”
Fall varsity sports will introduce their senior athletes, and coaches will take the stage.
Food vendors will also be available at Conquest, including Great Balls on Tires, the Slice Truck, Nom Nom Truck, Calbi Truck and Cafe D’Amore.
Conquest really should have been publicized more.
Seriously–Does this website ever get updated?! Third Eye Blind performed on Thursday–not today…

A team of doctors from the USC Keck School of Medicine performed a series of groundbreaking surgeries last month using robotic technology, making it the first of its kind in kidney surgeries.
The operations — which were led by Dr. Inderbir Gill, founding director of the USC Institute of Urology — allowed patients Cecile Johnson of Bartlesville, Okla., and Gary Fradkin of Van Nuys, Calif., to keep their kidneys when they otherwise would have needed a transplant.

Gill said he believes using robotic technology for surgical procedures such as these will become the future standard for medicine.
“Going forward, robotics has the capability to extend the performance of the human hand. It will be able to outperform us in terms of dexterity and ability, and is really as steady as can be and can reach into tight corners,” he said.
Johnson, who was diagnosed with a renal artery aneurysm, has lived with only one kidney since the was 17. She was the first patient in the world to undergo surgery using robotic techniques to operate on a patient with one kidney.
“It’s pretty cool hearing about this new cutting-edge technology. Knowing Dr. Gill’s background and the reputation that precedes him, it didn’t surprise me at all that he used these kinds of pioneering techniques,” Johnson said. “It was really amazing to me to see how far medical science has come.”
The operation was challenging for Gill because Johnson only had a one kidney.
“Doing surgery on the aneurysm in just one kidney is very risky because if it doesn’t go well, the patient will lose that kidney and have to go on dialysis,” Gill said. “This became an extremely high risk and challenging aspect of this particular surgery, but the operation went beautifully.”
The second surgery was performed on Fradkin, who was diagnosed with tumors on both kidneys.
After undergoing numerous CAT and MRI scans, Fradkin was referred to Dr. Gill by his regular physician.
“Going into surgery, there was a 70 percent chance that they would have to end up removing my right kidney,” Fradkin said. “But through Dr. Gill’s experience and the technology that he is currently using, he was able to save almost my entire kidney, with only 5 percent needing to be removed.”
Gill also relied heavily on various other forms of technology in addition to the robotic surgical techniques in order to prepare for Fradkin’s complex operation.
“We got some highly sophisticated CAT scans and then reconstructed the images from those using a type of software that we have developed here at USC. We constructed a three-dimensional image from those CAT scans and created a virtual reality representation of the tumor that allowed me to figure out just exactly how to cut out the tumor,” Gill said.
Both Fradkin and Johnson attributed their successful surgeries and recoveries to the extensive experience of Dr. Gill and his team, which included Dr. Casey Ng, Dr. Mukul Patil, Dr. Osamu Ukimura and computer engineer Dr. Masahiko Nakamoto.
“Dr. Gill and his team of doctors at USC were just wonderful to have at my side. They answered any question I had and just made me feel really good about the entire process,” Johnson said.
The two patients said they would recommend using robotic technology in surgery for patients with similar conditions in the future as well.
“Honestly, I think that this type of procedure is the only way to go now,” Fradkin said.

More than 40 years ago, Cecilia Woloch began writing poetry as a teenager. Now, a creative writing lecturer in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, Woloch was recently awarded a National Endowment of the Arts Poetry Fellowship.
Woloch applied for the fellowship several times before, and when she finally received the fellowship this fall, she said she was not expecting it.
“To tell the truth, I sent the application and then promptly forgot about it — this is a survival tactic, because writers have to deal with a lot of rejections,” Woloch wrote in an e-mail. “I find it’s best to just send things out into the world and … be pleasantly surprised when a positive response comes back.”
Margaret Russett, chair of the Department of English, said that Woloch’s fellowship is a great honor for the department.
“We are thrilled. She really deserves it and she’s been a very productive and admired colleague for a very long time,” Russett said.
Eligibility for the NEA fellowship depends on factors such as previous published work. Anyone who meets eligibility requirement can apply and have their work reviewed, said Jon Peede, NEA director of literature.
“It is an anonymous review process,” Peede said. “Nothing is known, whether you’re a graduate student or you’re an endowed chair.”
Woloch has been a full-time lecturer at USC since fall 2006 before she taught here as an adjunct professor.
She teaches courses in poetry writing, emphasizing the creative work students produce letting them experiment with language and poetry.
Woloch said one of her favorite courses to teach, The Writer in the Community (ENGL 404), allows her to take about a dozen USC students to neighborhood schools and train students to write poetry.
“The results are amazing, and life-changing for everyone involved. I worked as a poet in schools, and created community poetry programs, for many years before coming to USC, so it’s great to have this opportunity to pass the torch to my undergraduates,” Woloch said.
She also said the fellowship will allow her to take some time off from her job as a lecturer and continue on her current project.
“The dollar amount is $25,000, but the opportunity and encouragement it provides are priceless,” Woloch said. “The main purpose of the fellowship is to give writers the time to write, the time to research their work and possibly travel to locations that are essential to their work.”
Woloch said she has been creating a long work in prose that resembles a travel memoir, which attempts to piece together a complex family history rooted in Eastern Europe.
“I’ve traveled regularly to that part of the world for the past decade, and the manuscript I’ve been working on is shaping us as a socio-political mystery, in addition to memoir and biography,” Woloch said.
By this time next year, Woloch said she hopes to have the material for the first draft of her work, at which point she will need more time to analyze and shape it into a coherent piece.
Woloch frequently wrote about family and friends, relationships and the connections people form with one another.
“I’m fascinated with how close poetry can come to describing the mysteries of human life and with the intensity and music that poetry can make of language,” Woloch said. “Something magical can happen between words, and that magic can be transmitted when the words are exactly right.”

Instead of going home to be with family and friends over winter break, a group of 19 USC students will travel to Belize to volunteer at an orphanage.
The students will assist at the Liberty Children’s Home, which is run by the United Kingdom-based Liberty Foundation, near Belize’s capital in Central America.
The trip to Belize is one of three international alternative break programs sponsored by the USC Volunteer Center.
The purpose of alternative winter break is to provide an opportunity for USC students to engage in international service, said Nina Portugal, a senior majoring in English and a student trip coordinator for AWB Belize.
“AWB is a service-learning experience,” Portugal said. “It is an opportunity to serve abroad and bring global extremes back to the USC community.”
For 20 days, the students will be helping children from the Liberty Children’s Home who are on break for the holiday season.
“We will work in the orphanage from breakfast until after dinner tutoring kids and planning sports activities and art projects,” Portugal said. “We will [also] teach them about healthy eating and how to properly use a toothbrush.”
Portugal said the group wanted to volunteer at an orphanage in a country with a high poverty rate and chose this specific orphanage because a group of USC undergraduate students worked there two summers ago.
“Thirty-nine percent of the youth [in Belize] lack basic needs and don’t make it onto secondary education,” Portugal said.
Victor Paredes-Colonia, a senior majoring in international relations and economics and the AWB coordinator, said he is excited to travel to Belize and work with children.
“I’m looking forward to living in an environment where I’ve never lived in and working with children in a long term capacity,” Paredes-Colonia said.
As much as Paredes-Colonia said he hopes to make a positive impact on the lives of the orphans, he said he is also looking for personal development.
“I hope to learn something about myself in a new environment,” he said.
Participants of AWB Belize are responsible for paying for the program themselves.
To help lessen the cost of the program for individual volunteers, AWB hosts a variety of fundraisers, including a salsa night held in November in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom.
“We have an Adopt-a-Breaker program, which allows friends and family to sponsor an individual participant,” Portugal said.
Scholarships are also available through the Volunteer Center. Students who obtain a scholarship through the Volunteer Center are required to share their knowledge from the trip in the USC community.
“They must bring a part of the trip back to USC,” Portugal said. “Some students are creating documentaries, writing blogs or volunteering at children’s shelters in L.A. when they return from Belize.”
The Liberty Children’s Home was founded in 2005 and is designed for the abandoned and sexually abused children in need.
We met some Liberty kids when they came for a fundraiser at Pedro’s Pizza on Ambergris Caye. They were all delightful. You will have a fabulous time volunteering there.
There is a need to correct misinformation reported by Ms. Nina Portugal. The Central Intelligence Agency reports the following: Literacy: 
definition: age 15 and over can read and write
total population: 76.9%
male: 76.7%
female: 77.1% (2000 census)
By my calculation, this represents twenty-three percent not thirty-nine percent as reported by Ms. Portugal. For the record, Belize has one of the highest literacy rates in Central America.
[…] Instead of starting home to be with family as well as friends over winter break, a organisation of nineteen USC students will transport to Belize to proffer during an orphanage. The students will support during a Liberty Children’s Home, that is run by a United Kingdom-based … Go to full articles […]

KUSC, USC’s classical music station, will collaborate with the Los Angeles Master Chorale to broadcast the choir’s concerts and performances this winter.

The Los Angeles Master Chorale is the resident choir at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and is directed by USC alumnus Grant Gershon. This sort of broadcast collaboration between the choir and KUSC has taken place in the past and both parties said they are eager to restart the practice.
“We are very happy to resume this partnership and put these concerts on for a wider audience. KUSC is a very distinguished and highly regarded station,” said Terry Knowles, executive director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale.
The partnership will take the form of two radio shows that will begin on Dec. 19. Each broadcast will occur every Sunday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and will be hosted and produced by KUSC music personality Alan Chapman. The broadcast series is being funded by the Los Angeles County Arts Committee.
KUSC will air the concerts when that the choir performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The main goal of the series is to provide more access to these exclusive concerts, beyond the audience that attends at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
“We are the most listened-to public radio station in the U.S. and because of our Internet stream we have fans in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and even Singapore,” said Gail Eichenthal, the program director of KUSC, who spearheaded the collaboration between the station and LAMC.
KUSC’s strong listenership of more than 700,000 will provide maximum exposure to LAMC, Eichenthal said.
The funding for KUSC comes from its fan base, with donations from 400,000 listeners making up about 70 percent of the station’s budget. Most of these donations come from listeners in Southern California, she said.
Eichenthal said KUSC is looking forward to including more Hanukkah and Christmas programming as the holidays approach.
Eichenthal said the balance of music played on KUSC is constantly being assessed and revised. The station tries to include every type of classical music.
“We try to attract a broader, younger audience, keep the programming fresh and stimulating — but still satisfy — people’s desire for the great classics of the last 500 years,” she said.

The Graduate and Professional Student Senate passed an initiative this week to subsidize the travel of graduate students to and from conferences for up to $500 per academic year.
GPSS President Jenny Novak said the Conference Travel Fund was the biggest item on the budget this month. The fund has approximately $160,000 available for graduate students who will present or attend conferences. Too often the funds are left unused, which is why GPSS is hoping this new initiative will encourage greater participation, Novak said.
“This is the first year we’re trying to open it up to students who just want to attend conferences,” she said. “In the past, it was only for students who were presenting original research.”
Yet, according to the approved initiative, presenters will receive priority funding, and remaining funds will be split among students who wish to attend the conference.
Kathleen Ritterbush, a GPSS senator and finance committee member, said this initiative will help graduate students develop their careers.
“It has a huge impact on our careers. Conference travel is particularly important for the earth sciences; without it, no one would see the work we do,” said Ritterbush, a graduate student studying geological sciences.  “We need resources to help fund traveling to, and paying for, the conferences. Traveling is a lot on a pocketbook of a graduate student.”
In addition to funding from GPSS, graduate students can also receive money to help subsidize the cost of travel to and from conferences from various departments, cultural and ethnic organizations, and certain deans.
Emad Bahrami Samani, a graduate student studying computational biology and bioinformatics, said he is looking forward to utilizing funds from the initiative.
“You don’t always have a paper to present and the university might not pay for it. This is a way to have an opportunity to go to a conference so that’s a great idea,” Samani said. “Conferences are a really great opportunity to meet people in your area of research.”
Though the initiative might mean more work for members on the GPSS funding committee, Ritterbush said it is worth it.
“As a finance member, it’s going to be a lot of work,” Ritterbush said. “But we would be thrilled if every drop of that money at the end of the year had gone to USC graduate and professional students who have presented or attended a major conference in their field because it will make a huge impact on their career.”
Does this stipend include local membership/conference costs? If so, it’s exactly what we  need!
Great! Conferences outside of California can cost over 500 dollars with airfare, hotel, and food. These subsidies will help a lot.

The plans for USC’s new health center are nearing the final stages, with space allotted for more exam rooms, offices and a separate clinic for faculty and staff.
Plans for a new health center have been underway for the last 10 years. The growth in the size of the university and in the number of students visiting the health center called for a larger facility to cope with growing number of patients, Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, director of the University Park Health Center, said.
The new health center will offer enough examination rooms and waiting areas to give students more privacy. There will also be more counseling offices.
“Our [current] facility is too small for the volume, which has increased from 35,000 individual visits in 1995 to over 90,000 this past year,” Neinstein wrote in an e-mail.
Offices that had to be moved out of the current building will be included in the new center.
Neinstein said that the new health center will bring together services that had been previously spread across campus, such as counseling, insurance and potentially physical therapy. There will likely be space for Health Promotion and Prevention Services in the center, as well, Neinstein said.
“It will place most of our services in one location,” Neinstein said. “The flow should be much better, [which will] decrease waiting time.”
Technologies in the new center will also be more advanced. Students will be able to check in, make appointments electronically, and obtain health records and labs electronically.
The new center, which will be a minimum of three stories above ground, will stand in front of Parking Structure B on the empty lot near the back of the Lyon Center.
There are three stages in the construction of new buildings on campus. Stage One consists of the initial drawings and planning of locations and space.
According to Neinstein, this stage was completed three years ago, but the project was put on hold due to the economy and the halt of construction on campus.
The new center is currently in between Stage One and Stage Two, which is the final plan and obtaining permits. Stage three is construction of the building.
“We know that President Nikias is very supportive of the new facility and so we are hopeful this will move forward in the near future,” Neinstein said.
Construction will begin nine to 12 months after Stage Two is completed.
“We would hope this will provide a facility that is much needed for students on a university that has become a residential university with so many students living on or right off campus,” Neinstein said.
A much-needed addition to the USC campus.  Let’s hope that with a new and improved facility, weekend hours will be increased.  The large number of students living on or around campus should have better access to health care.
