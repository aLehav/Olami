The Los Angeles Lakers don’t do losing. This is a franchise that has won the second-most championships and games of any team in NBA history, and has gone to the NBA Finals more than any other team. They have attracted more stars than any other franchise, from Wilt Chamberlain to Magic Johnson to Kobe Bryant, and dominate the fanbase in the country’s second-largest market despite sharing a building with another team. Until a few years ago, the longest the Lakers had gone without making the playoffs was two seasons in 1975 and 1976. 
But now, the era of Lakers exceptionalism is coming to an end. The franchise hasn’t made the postseason since 2013 and has suffered its four worst seasons by total losses in its history over that span. The last five years have featured more dysfunction and failure than the previous 30 combined.
It’s hard to pinpoint when exactly the downfall began. After winning the 2010 championship, the Lakers lost in the second round in back-to-back playoffs, prompting major changes in the summer of 2012. They traded for Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, teaming them with Bryant and Pau Gasol and creating what many thought would be the next great superteam. However, Bryant and Howard clashed off the court, and the 38-year-old Nash’s body started breaking down. The Lakers struggled to a 45-37 record, and Bryant tore his Achilles in the 80th game of the regular season. They were swept by the eventual champion Spurs in the first round, Howard departed for Houston in free agency, and Nash and Bryant were never able to return to form. Without a star, the team went on to struggle through five losing seasons.
But the issues really began when team owner Jerry Buss died in February 2013, just two months before Bryant’s catastrophic injury. Buss bought the team in 1979 and the Lakers immediately became the most successful team in the last 40 years, winning 10 championships under his leadership. But Buss’ biggest contributions came in the realm of style.
Magic Johnson came to town the same year that Buss bought the team and, together, they ushered in the Showtime era. Johnson’s flashy passing and breakneck pace made the Lakers the most entertaining team in the league, while Buss used his connections and business savvy to make games at The Forum in Inglewood a hot spot for celebrities. Laker games were an event, a place to be seen just as much as a place to watch great basketball.
That didn’t change when the Lakers moved into Staples Center and began their three-peat with Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. The Lakers had the two biggest stars in the game, and Buss knew how to sell them, dimming the lights shining on the audience and transforming the hardwood into a stage and players into performers. Even as the team struggled at the end of Bryant’s career and after his retirement, Lakers games remained a popular attraction for reasons outside of basketball alone.
But event culture can only take you so far in a results-based business. Time after time, Buss made the right calls that maintained the Lakers’ standing as a great basketball team: He promoted Pat Riley to head coach and was rewarded with four championships. He stuck with Jerry West as general manager after some down years in the early ‘90s, which brought O’Neal, Bryant and three more championships to the team. And he convinced Bryant to stay with the team after the star shooting guard demanded a trade in 2007, bringing the team two more championships. Buss was more than an entertainer and a fantastic businessman. He had the basketball knowledge to pick the right people and enough humility to stay out of the way when needed.
But after his death, the franchise that always seemed to make the right decisions began to fall victim to frequent mistakes. Mitch Kupchak, the general manager for each of Bryant’s title teams, was unable to bring in productive veterans and couldn’t pick young players who could return the Lakers to their former glory. Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka, the new decision-makers, continued this ineptitude. Perhaps their worst move was trading guard D’Angelo Russell after just two years with the team. In his fourth year in the league, Russell is averaging 20.5 points, 6.7 assists and earned an All-Star nod. His replacement, Lonzo Ball, still can’t shoot and has missed 42 games to injury in a season and a half.
The team did land LeBron James this summer, but James has done more to shine the light on the Lakers’  inadequacies than to open up new opportunities. The team tried to strongarm the New Orleans Pelicans into trading them Anthony Davis at the trade deadline before other teams had better opportunities this summer, and were summarily embarrassed when the plot didn’t work out in their favor. They are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, with a below .500 record and the third-worst point differential in the Western Conference despite having the greatest player in the world on the team. Even accounting for the games James has missed, the effort this season has been disappointing.
The Lakers have star talent and are still a big draw. But amid the worst stretch in franchise history, it’s worth wondering if the Lakers will ever truly return to their royal form.

Despite winning four of its previous six games, the USC women’s basketball team failed to add to its recent success when it traveled north to take on Oregon State and Oregon over the weekend. 
The Trojans, who are ranked in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings, have not lived up to their expectations this season. Currently 5-11 in conference play after this weekend, the Women of Troy hope to turn things around with less than two weeks until the Pac-12 tournament. 
Senior guard Aliyah Mazyck said she was still encouraged, despite the results. 
“It didn’t go as we expected in losing two games, but I think that the camaraderie was there, and we were definitely there as a team,” Mazyck said.
On Friday, the Trojans fell 61-68 to No. 9 Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore. Earlier this season, the Beavers gave the Trojans their fifth consecutive conference loss in a 76-52 beatdown at Galen Center. The game was much closer this time around, but after a Trojan lead, the Beavers were able to come back for the win.
Through three quarters, the Trojans led by just 2 points in a tight contest. All the Trojans had to do was play the way they had the entire game to earn their first win against a ranked opponent this year. Unfortunately, the Trojans gave up 25 points in the fourth quarter while only scoring 16, allowing the Beavers to earn the comeback win. 
Mazyck continued her recent hot streak, scoring 25 points and stealing the ball three times in 39 minutes. For the Beavers, the duo of junior guard Mikayla Pivec and redshirt sophomore guard Destiny Slocum combined for 34 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.
One unsung hero for the Trojans was junior forward Kayla Overbeck, who was second only to Mazyck in almost every category. Over the last three games, Overbeck averaged over 11 points, six rebounds and nearly 30 minutes on the court. For a team whose spotlight has primarily fallen on sister guards senior Mariya Moore and junior Minyon Moore for most of this season, Overbeck has contributed her fair share.
On Sunday, the Trojans fell to No. 6 Oregon 96-78. Led by star junior guard Sabrina Ionescu, the Ducks are currently 25-3 overall and in sole possession of first place in the Pac-12. Unless something goes off the rails, the Ducks are en route to their third-straight NCAA tournament appearance.
In the first quarter, USC was able to keep up with the Ducks’ high-powered offense, outscoring them 27-25 in a shootout. Mariya Moore started the game off firing, scoring the Trojans’ first 8 points. She would finish with 30 points, six assists and six rebounds while playing the entire game.
It did not take long for the Ducks to begin playing at their typical level, scoring a total of 46 points in the second and third quarters to the Trojans’ 26 points. USC needed to crack down on defense in the fourth quarter, but both teams scored an even 25 points, giving the Ducks their 14th conference win of the year. 
“We competed for the most part, it’s just something that we can do better,” Mazyck said. “I know that giving up 96 points doesn’t show much, but I think that we did well, and when [Oregon] went on an offensive streak, we answered right back.”
Having been overshadowed by Ionescu throughout the season, Ducks’ redshirt sophomore forward Erin Boley had one of her best games against the Trojans. Boley missed only seven shots and scored 32 points. She poured in eight 3-pointers, her second most from long-distance in a game this season. 
As for the Trojans, Overbeck cooled down after a fantastic performance on Friday, scoring only 1 point in 14 minutes played.
“Hopefully, we can continue to be consistent playing both offense and defense,” Mazyck said. “I play with all my heart when I go out there and hopefully my teammates feel the same way.”
The Trojans travel back to Galen Center for their final home series of the season. The team will face Colorado 7 p.m. Friday, followed by a season finale matchup against Utah 12 p.m. Sunday.

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MEMORY AT USC?
Winning [the NCAA championship] my freshman year and my junior year were by far my favorite memories here at USC, just because it’s not an opportunity many people get to have. [I’m] super proud to be a part of this program and [to] have experienced that with the girls here. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS FROM YOUR TIME AT USC?
The only thing I wish I could go back and change is my sophomore season, when we fell short. We lost in the semifinals to Stanford and ended up not winning the title that year. That’s the only thing that haunts my past: not winning NCAAs my sophomore year.
WHAT’S NEXT FOR YOU?
I want to fight for a spot on the Olympic team. It’s going to be a tough go. I want to make the top two … I would love to be the No. 1 goalie on the No. 1 team in the world and make the Olympics.
WHAT’S ONE THING ABOUT PLAYING GOALIE THAT MOST PEOPLE DON’T KNOW?
Being in the cage for me, what’s so difficult is [that] some field players, they can get by without being a part of the real mistake. But any goal that goes by, I have to live with the rest of my life. It’s a punch to the heart every time one goes by that I don’t think people in a different position can really fully fathom. For me, that’s the thing I have a hard time living with [as] a goalie — it’s an everyday thing. 
WHAT IS IT LIKE TO PLAY FOR THE U.S. NATIONAL TEAM?
It’s so cool — just everything that I dreamed of since I started playing water polo, as well as playing for [the] program here … moving on to after the season with the national team, I’m just excited to fight for the chance to play at the Olympic level and hopefully win a gold medal. It’s exciting and unbelievable to play with girls at a high level.
WHAT HAVE YOU HAD TO SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO BE A STUDENT-ATHLETE?
It’s a lot. And it’s all worth it, for sure. I’ve had to sacrifice a lot of friendships from my past, from high school. Quite frankly, it’s hard to stay in contact and connect as often. I’ve had to give up a lot of family time. I’m not allowed to ride ATVs and motorcycles and all that fun stuff I used to do when I was a child, so I don’t get to do a lot of family vacations like that anymore. Just family time, period. My family’s not that far. But that’s a huge thing … people from across the country, from across the world that play here, they get to see their families even less. But I live 50 miles from my family in Moorpark, Calif., and I don’t get to spend as much as time with them as I wish I could. So from high school to now and especially with [the] national team, just sacrificing those relationships — it’s been difficult.
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR FRESHMEN ATHLETES?
When I came here, I had to fight for playing time with a girl, [Victória Chamorro], that was just about to go to the Olympics that following summer and who came in the year before me as a freshman and started. I absolutely love Vic, and we had a great relationship. But that’s tough to come in and fight for a spot, especially if it’s already taken. But what I can say and speak to is that regardless of whether you’re a freshman or older, you need to come in and have some grit and play hard to earn your playing time. You need to fight for it. You can’t look down on yourself and use ‘I’m young’ as an excuse. Other people might say it. You have to be willing to be young and be that starter, that starting goalie, whatever it may be. You have to want that for yourself. And if you really pour [on] the coals … and put in the extra effort and stay after practice and fix all the things coaches tell you, they recognize that. And that’s a huge, huge thing for your teammates to see as well when you’re a freshman.

The 91st Academy Awards kicked off Sunday night, highlighting the best artistic and technical direction of last year’s most acclaimed films. However, Hollywood’s finest weren’t the only big winners. Plenty of USC alumni took home awards Sunday, a testament to the University’s prestigious School of Cinematic Arts.  
The night kicked off with a big win for the University. Regina King, who won Best Supporting Actress for her performance in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” briefly attended USC for two years as a communication major before dropping out to pursue her dream of becoming an actress.
“It’s appropriate for me to be standing here,” King said as she accepted her award. “‘Cause I’m an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone.”
Another major winner at the Oscars was “Black Panther.” Though he was not nominated for his directorial work on “Black Panther,” SCA alumnus Ryan Coogler played an essential role in creating a film that seemed to break down cultural barriers in Hollywood. Winning three awards out of seven nominations, it marked the first Oscar win for a blockbuster Marvel film, and it was the first time that a superhero film was nominated for Best Picture.
“Black Panther” won for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design (the winner, Ruth E. Carter, is the first black woman to ever win for the category) and Best Original Score -— the composer, Ludwig Göransson, is also a USC alumnus. Göransson, who studied at the Thornton School of Music, met Coogler during their time at USC.
“Ryan, I remember 12 years ago we were sitting in our dorm at USC writing the score for your first short film,” Göransson said in his acceptance speech. “And now we’re here 12 years later celebrating one of the most important cinematic moments in history.”
Veteran film editor John Ottoman, who graduated from SCA in 1988, won Best Film Editing for his work on “Bohemian Rhapsody.” As an undergraduate, Ottoman was known for how masterfully he edited the work of his peers. Notably, he helped edit a piece that eventually went on to win a student Academy Award. It was also there that Ottman met director Bryan Singer — the two have been collaborators ever since, with “Bohemian Rhapsody” as their most recent collaboration.
Singer transferred from the School of Visual Arts in New York to SCA, where he majored in critical studies. Until recently, Singer was the namesake of the Division of Cinema & Media Studies, but his name was promptly removed after allegations of sexual assault and sexual abuse against him were uncovered. 
A pleasant surprise from the night was USC alumna and Iranian-American film director Rayka Zehtabchi’s win for Best Documentary Short for her critically acclaimed piece, “Period. End of Sentence.” 
“I’m not crying because I’m on my period, or anything,” Zehtabchi said during her acceptance speech. “I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar.” 
Throughout all the stories heard on the stage last night, the impact that the School of Cinematic Arts has had on Hollywood is undeniable. It’s safe to say that Hollywood’s biggest night wouldn’t be the same without USC.

On tour for her critically acclaimed studio album “Room 25,” Chicago-based artist Noname provided an exceptionally personable set to a sold-out crowd at the Wiltern Theatre Thursday night.
Opening for Noname was fellow Chicago native Elton. In the same vein of the jazzy Chicago sound perpetuated by other hometown rappers like Chance the Rapper and Saba, Elton’s set featured a neo-jazz sound peppered with cosmic elements that helped prep the crowd for Noname’s set to come. 
Elton’s production was bouncy and groovy. His overall performance exuded genuineness through lyrics that properly reflected his confident on-stage persona. His lyrics were emotional and unrelentingly positive — characteristic of the Chicago hip-hop scene’s new wave of talent. Elton was well-received, with many in the crowd cheering him on as he closed out his set.
Before Noname took the stage, a neon sign that read “Room 25” hung on the back wall, illuminating the area as members of her live band warmed up. Dressed head to toe in black, Noname began her set with songs from her recent album “Room 25,” which were well-received by the audience.
Noname’s subtle flow highlighted her impeccable lyricism, which was further enhanced by her accompanying band and soulful background singers. The live elements of her backing also highlighted to many of the audience members that Noname’s music is not just hip-hop, but rather a lovechild of hip-hop, neo-soul and jazz delivered by a flawed and vulnerable poet who is understanding of her situation and the world she inhabits. 
Noname’s performance was engaging because of her self-awareness, which she carried throughout her performance. When the crowds cheered overwhelmingly after each song, Noname would instruct them to “shut the fuck up” and inform them that they were “petty” in a humorous and light-hearted tone.
Near the tail end of her set, frequent collaborator Phoelix graced the stage. Phoelix is another Chicago native who has produced for artists like Saba and Smino. Before he came on, Noname informed the crowd of how Phoelix was responsible for most of the smooth neo-jazz and live instrumentation found throughout her discography. Phoelix and Noname performed “Part of Me” and “Window” before he left the stage.
To close out her set, Noname performed “Telefone” off her 2016 album of the same name, but she felt the need to restart the song because she wanted those who knew the lyrics to sing along from the beginning. After delivering an explosive closing performance and a quick shoutout to all her bandmates, Noname left the stage, leaving the crowd with the soulful backing of her singers and band. 
Following the call for an encore, Noname returned to the stage without her band or singers to thank the audience for supporting her and “helping her family pay rent.” What followed was an acapella performance of “Casket Pretty” between the crowd and Noname, a fitting ending to an intimate performance between artist and audience.

Humans are imperfect. Put around 8,000 of them together to try to agree on one thing, and you’ll get some imperfect results. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is one such experiment — and it, more often than not, yields those imperfect results. 
For decades now, but especially in recent years, the Academy Awards have polarized viewers with the their questionable decisions. On paper, they’re supposed to recognize the best of the best in each of 24 categories, but add voting politics, actual politics and a plethora of other factors into the mix (like legacy, past snubs and sheer popularity) and you get winners not everyone will agree with. Just consult my Twitter timeline during Sunday’s 91st Oscars — it ranged from vehement disapproval to unfiltered elation from one tweet to the next.
Sunday’s ceremony concluded on a sour note, as “Green Book” took Best Picture. Sour is truly the perfect word to describe it; it didn’t feel right to see “Dumb and Dumber” director Peter Farrelly accepting cinema’s highest honor; it didn’t seem right that a film whose script was called out for its lack of accuracy in portraying its African American protagonist won Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. But the real underlying sourness of it all was that it didn’t seem right that this self-proclaimed prestigious voting body had apparently taken a step back in terms of its definition of what it means for a film to be named Best Picture. 
Bear with me — “Green Book” is not a bad movie. It’s not Best Picture quality, but it isn’t a trainwreck either. It has two good performances at its core (Mahershala Ali won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Don Shirley), an adequately-paced plot and it leaves you feeling warm and full of hope — or, at least, it gets points for earnestly trying to. The problem with the film and its baffling victory really boils down to two questions: Who gets to tell what stories? Who gets to dictate what stories are important? 
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, “Green Book” producer Octavia Spencer said she doesn’t think a story about a certain culture must be told exclusively by people of that culture. 
“Should Asian people only tell Asian stories?” Spencer questioned. “Should African Americans only tell African American stories? I don’t think we should ever get in the business of saying who should be telling certain stories. It’s crazy to me.” 
But when the production and execution of a film are neither transparent nor respectful, then, especially in our culture today, controversy is simply inevitable. And once a drop of controversy drips onto a film, it’s probably better to leave it be and not elevate it for all the world to see.  
Farrelly, a director whose Wikipedia page reads,“mostly famous for directing and producing quirky, slightly offensive comedy and romantic comedy films,” shouldn’t be anyone’s first choice to handle a film about race relations. Yet he did, and technically it wasn’t as objectively bad as some of his “slightly offensive” comedies, but its content and post-release handling illustrated how Farrelly wasn’t entirely fit to handle the story’s themes. 
“Green Book” is too reductive for a society that has moved on to produce nuanced tales like “Black Panther,” “BlacKkKlansman” and even “Vice.” While racism still exists in our world, Farrelly’s film brings no new solution or thought to the table; if anything, its victory almost sets us back a couple decades. Whereas these other films are keenly aware of how past struggles clash and deal with the present in fairly complicated ways, “Green Book” is simply stuck in the past. 
To make matter worse, Don Shirley’s family publicly criticized Farrelly and his writers, which included Nick Vallelonga (son of Tony Vallelonga, portrayed by Viggo Mortensen in the film), for their skewed portrayal of Shirley’s life and personality. Again, “Green Book” is not a bad movie in its own right, but the problematic handling of a black man’s life in a film supposed to be about overcoming racism creates some pretty murky waters that most Oscar viewers were praying the Academy would steer clear of. 
But it happened. “Green Book” won Best Picture — and I can’t believe I just typed that sentence. It’s a sign of the Academy’s elusive taste, of course, when one year they award Jordan Peele’s original script for “Get Out” and the next year they award Farrelly and Vallelonga, but it’s also a reminder to all of us that the Oscars are not king. 
I’m positive there are at least 8,000 people (myself included) who thought “Eighth Grade” was the best film of the year. If we all coalesced in one place at one time and declared it thus, who’s to say our opinion is less significant than the Academy’s? Yes, the latter has prestige, but that depends on its audience affording it that prestige. It’s up to us to decide if we will take the Oscars seriously. Even if a more publicly favored movie like “Roma” or “A Star is Born” took home Best Picture, its win would be meaningless without the importance American audiences place on the Oscars.
Humans are imperfect, yes, but each one of us has value. One person may think “Green Book” is the Best Picture, another “Eighth Grade,” heck, another “Bohemian Rhapsody” — everyone is entitled to argue for their favorites. The reason people get outraged when the Academy awards “Green Book” is really because they feel that the decision establishes an objective truth that this movie is the greatest achievement of the year, when it’s really not.
The point is, we shouldn’t take the Academy’s decision to award a problematic film to be the end of all things. Everyone can and should award their own Best Picture award to the one movie that left them feeling something they hadn’t before or  that taught them a crucial lesson. After all, I think many voters who earnestly loved “Green Book” did so because they genuinely thought it was an important story. They had the biggest platform to make their voice heard, of course, but each one of us can choose to either buckle under the weight of the Academy’s clout and judgement or to individually keep championing the stories that truly mean the most to us because every opinion, whether delivered from the Oscar stage or not, matters.

Earlier this month, Provost Michael Quick announced the launch of the Provost Task Force on University Nomenclature in a memo to the USC community. The committee will establish a set of guidelines when reassessing names of buildings and other prominent structures across campus that are named after people who are associated with having hateful or oppressive views. The committee will also establish procedures for faculty, staff and students to submit their concerns. While the creation of the task force and its guidelines is a positive step toward accomplishing inclusion on campus, USC must take assertive and thorough action in quickly removing such offensive nomenclature and statues on campus.
Universities across the nation have enacted changes for several years; Duke, Georgetown, Stanford, Yale and UC Berkeley are just a handful of USC’s peer institutions that have renamed controversial buildings following revelations about their namesakes. In examining these universities’ choices, a common theme arises — academic institutions other than USC are far beyond the scope of establishing processes and procedures, and they have removed offensive names from their own infrastructure.
The demand to remove such nomenclature at USC has been an active debate for over three years. Students and organizations continue to express open opposition to the Von KleinSmid Center, a building named after USC’s fifth president Rufus B. Von KleinSmid. Von KleinSmid was a proponent of the eugenics movement, which advocated for forced sterilization and exclusion of certain racial groups. Although it may be evident that his actions and views have no place in today’s society, the University has taken little tangible action to address the building’s controversial name.
With the creation of the Provost Task Force, it’s clear that USC is adopting an aware but cautious stance on a national issue plaguing academic institutions across the United States. However, this conservative action is unacceptable because it will merely prolong the existence of a contentious issue. USC administration should establish direct, concrete change through specific actions rather than creating a task force that follows extensive procedures and discussion, delaying the process rather than directly addressing concerns. 
Stanford’s recent changes to nomenclature exemplify alterations that USC should take into consideration when addressing key issues, such as the name of VKC. Last September, Stanford announced it would be removing Father Junipero Serra, the controversial priest who founded the California mission system, from the list of names on its main entrance, mailing address and two buildings. This decision was made based on the Serra mission system’s mistreatment and abuse of California Native Americans for more than 60 years. The process to remove the saint’s name began in 2016, and two years later, intensive analysis concluded that Serra Way should be renamed to honor Jane Stanford, co-founder of the university.
And while change on this scale has yet to happen on either of USC’s campuses, the important takeaway from this event is that thorough analysis needs to be at the forefront of reconciliation. The task force ultimately demonstrates the University’s slow but careful action that can leave less room for error. Nevertheless, the creation of the committee does not provide the USC community with enough of a voice to emphasize their concerns. While the task force may seem beneficial in theory, it will do little more than stall efforts to enact any changes in nomenclature whatsoever.
No one, including administration, can erase the history that was created by figures such as Von KleinSmid or Widney. What faculty, staff and students can do, though, is push the administration into enacting assertive changes and encouraging a safe and welcoming campus environment through definitive changes to nomenclature and architecture. Dwelling on the goals of the task force, one message shines loud and clear: No change will come if we act broadly and slowly.
A previous version of this article contained an error. The article stated the Widney Alumni House was named for former USC president Joseph Widney. The Widney Alumni House is named for Robert Widney. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Earlier this month, both sides presented their closing arguments in the case Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard before the Massachusetts District Court. Now, it’s all up to Judge Allison Burroughs. She will have to review thousands of pages and make the decision as to whether Harvard University’s use of affirmative action and consideration of race in its admissions illegally infringes on students’ — particularly Asian students’ — 14th Amendment right to equal protection. 
While the judiciary has already opined on the topic of affirmative action quite a few times, this case is different. Most previous cases dealt with public university systems, including the University of California and University of Michigan systems. Harvard, a private institution, is not necessarily bound by the 14th Amendment. Some supporters of Harvard’s use of race in admissions argue that the private university has a First Amendment right to select its students based on whatever factors it chooses.
Regardless, this case exposes something much bigger than the issue of affirmative action itself — it epitomizes the politicization of today’s judiciary.
The common conservative viewpoint on affirmative action advocates for its abolition through the judiciary because it unfairly discriminates against white Americans. But compare this viewpoint with other conservative ideologies regarding private business’ rights to discriminate, and the logic does not hold up. 
The traditional, small government conservative or libertarian standpoint regarding government intrusion in private business affairs is clear: It should not happen. After all, conservatives supported the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission Supreme Court decision, which affirmed a religious baker’s First Amendment right to refuse service to members of the LGBTQ+ community. 
Doesn’t the same logic apply here, too? Courts have long recognized the First Amendment doctrine of “academic freedom,” which “includes the [university’s] selection of its student bodies.” If the First Amendment is applicable to affirmative action cases, maybe private institutions can refuse to admit a white student or an Asian student purely based on their race. 
The question then becomes whether this is a world we want to live in. The traditional conservative-libertarian argument is that a capitalistic market will naturally weed out bigotry and discrimination because the only color capitalism cares about is green. Maybe that’s true. But if that is the case, then the same logic should apply when it comes to affirmative action. 
Some argue it is the government’s job to enact legislation to protect against discrimination. But Congress never passed a law prohibiting affirmative action. Maybe if conservatives feel so strongly against using race as a factor in admissions, they should enact legislation expressly forbidding it. This is exactly what conservatives have been telling liberals on the issue of abortion. Conservatives have for years (since Roe v. Wade) argued that abortion rights should be enacted through the elected branch as opposed to being engraved as rights by an unelected branch of government.
These different issues — affirmative action, private business discrimination and abortion rights — may seem like apples to oranges comparisons on the surface, but they really aren’t. They all stem from the court having to decide policy issues when Congress is in gridlock. 
The conservative position in the Harvard case can be summarized as follows: Private institutions need to be restrained by the government. The courts need to direct private institutions and tell them what they can and cannot do. This sounds like textbook government overreach conservatives usually abhor. 
The liberal position in the Harvard case says that Harvard — like all private institutions including hotels, bakeries and restaurants — has a First Amendment right to consider race in its selection process; Private organizations should only be bound by laws that are explicitly passed by Congress. That sounds like textbook free-market conservatism liberals consistently refute. 
Judge Burroughs is merely deciding which side will write the opening appellate brief as opposed to the reply brief. And as the case is appealed and moves further up in the court system, these matters of law will be heavily debated. Then perhaps the irony of these arguments will become clear as day.

Springfest will install an augmented reality art piece created by students at this year’s festival on March 30.  
The augmented reality installation will take place at McCarthy Quad and will feature a large, geometric dome that houses a multiplayer augmented reality game surrounded by three other art pieces. 
Creative director Cam Lindsay, a senior in the Iovine and Young Academy, said the game will be like a combination of “Guitar Hero” and “Dance Dance Revolution.” 
“I saw that the potential for [augmented reality] to fundamentally change live music is a really potent opportunity,” Lindsay said. “One that was inevitably going to take place which, for me, was very exciting.” 
Augmented reality is an interactive experience that uses sensory modules to superimpose information into a user’s surroundings, including geometric shapes or other objects that aren’t physically there. Perhaps the most popular use of augmented reality is the mobile game “Pokémon Go,” in which users can see a Pokémon in the surrounding real-world environment on their phone screen. 
Lindsay has been working on this installation for his senior capstone project, along with senior Jacob Fishman, the project’s production director. 
The two students also co-founded a company called Merciv in 2017. According to Lindsay, Merciv is an experimental design enterprise that integrates live music experiences with immersive technology.
Fishman and Lindsay previously created an augmented reality installation for a live concert, where guests could play with geometric shapes wearing headsets soundtracked to an unreleased song by the artist.  
“We launched it at a show, learned insane amounts and brought it to five more shows with that artist,” Fishman said. 
While virtual reality is tailored for one user’s experience, augmented reality allows multiple people to interact with the same objects or game simultaneously and creates more social experiences. 
“Everything we are doing here is all about the magic that happens in a live music setting ,where you’re on the same page with everyone around you about the experience you’re having and the incredible stuff that can only happen from being at that space at that time with the people that are there,” Fishman said.
According to Concerts Committee co-director Kira Stiers, the committee has previously tried to implement VR at Springfest. Stiers said that in the past, vendors were either not interested in the live-music experience, or the committee was unable to afford it.
“We never really had all the ducks in a row to get it to happen, but it’s been something we’ve been interested in for many years now,” said Stiers, a senior majoring in international relations and political science. “We do want our shows to be more interactive. We don’t want them to be photo-ops for people.” 
Twenty undergraduate and graduate students from eight of the USC professional schools, as well as a small group of UCLA students, are collaborating on the project. 
“I think this is a great opportunity to highlight why USC is a fundamentally different school than any other school out there,” Lindsay said. “There are opportunities within the school to bring together so many disciplines into something that’s so cohesive, like Springfest … I believe [it] is truly a Trojan strength.” 
Lindsay and Fishman act as middlemen to foster communication between the various clubs and organizations contributing to the project, each of which comes from a different background and institution. 
“We’re working with a large team … our job is to provide a platform and a space and an environment for these creative individuals to come together and do their best work,” Fishman said. “At the same time, we need to ensure creative vision over the entire thing and make sure each team is working together and communicating and that there is a unified design aesthetic between everything.” 
Lindsay said acquiring funding for the project was a challenge when they first began attempting to implement it. The headsets for the installation cost nearly $3,000. The team needs four headsets for the installation along with several projectors, large architectural installations and a team to assemble the entire experience. To cover this cost while also hosting the most optimized experience, the team is launching a crowdfunding effort Tuesday. 
“If we get [$10,000], this will be an incredible Springfest,” Lindsay said. “If we get [$7,000], it will be a great Springfest. If we don’t get either, we’ll just make do.” 
More details for Springfest will be released at the beginning of March.

As part of the Annenberg-HBO Diverse Voices Series, an initiative that explores diversity in entertainment, panelists spoke about police brutality and violence, particularly toward black women at Wallis Annenberg Hall. The panel followed a screening of excerpts from the documentary, “Say Her Name: The Life and Death of Sandra Bland.”
The film tells the story of Sandra Bland, a black woman who was pulled over by a white policeman for a traffic violation and wrongfully imprisoned, ultimately resulting in her unexplained death. 
“‘Say Her Name’ brings an intersectional perspective to the conversation and activism around Black Lives Matter, establishing race and gender as crucial frames for the way we talk about and understand violence against black women,” said Annenberg professor Alison Trope, who co-moderated the panel alongside professor Dan Birman. 
The discussion included documentary co-directors and producers David Heilbroner and Kate Davis, Bland’s sister Sharon Cooper and race and digital technology research scholar Brooklyne Gipson.
After screening the beginning of the film, the filmmakers wanted to be as authentic as possible in their depiction of Bland and her family because of the media frenzy surrounding her arrest and death.
“[We] let the audience know that they were going to be close up, that it would be a personal journey through the eyes of the family, largely,” Davis said. “We wanted to contrast that with the more public furor over her death.” 
The documentary-making process spanned two years. Heilbroner and Davis said they contacted the Bland family lawyer in hopes of telling Bland’s story and investigating the police misconduct that resulted in her wrongful imprisonment and death. Heilbroner said the significance of the story drew them to make the film.
“The symbolism of this case was so arresting,” Heilbroner said. “We’re talking about an African American woman found hanged in a Southern Texas jail cell. It just brought back this enormous history of lynching … Nobody knew what happened and nobody was getting answers.” 
In the process of making the documentary, Heilbroner said he expected to learn the details of Bland’s death. However, the question of whether she was killed or committed suicide remains unanswered because there were no cameras in her jail cell.
Davis said it ultimately did not matter how Bland died because the circumstances that led to her arrest already indicated that an injustice had occurred.
“[There is an] urgent need for police reform, de-escalation measures … There’s a legacy of just brutal treatment that the film addresses,” Davis said.  
According to Heilbroner, it was important to include the uncut footage of Bland’s arrest in the documentary. He said he wanted to show concrete evidence that Bland conducted herself correctly in her interaction with Texas Department of Safety Trooper Brian Encinia. The footage of Bland’s arrest shows her asking why she is being arrested and asserting her right not to leave her car or put out her cigarette.
“After a while, she reached her breaking point, and he needled her into a state of being pissed off,” Heilbroner said. “Anyone who’s followed the history of black Americans at the hands of white police should not be that surprised that you can eventually push somebody over the edge.” 
Cooper said it is also important to discuss what Encinia could have done differently when  interacting with a civilian to prevent the situation from becoming confrontational.
“Police officers swear to protect and serve the general public, so it’s their responsibility to engage in de-escalation tactics that they should be trained in,” Cooper said. “And in the event that they are not trained in those, their feet have to be held to the fire because they are impacting entire communities.” 
Cooper said that Bland’s interactions with the police added gender to the conversation about police brutality. According to Cooper, it is important to recognize that black women are victims of racial injustice as well and are just as unsafe in situations with police as black men.
“The power in this film … brings black women and girls into the conversation in a way that I don’t believe that they were before,” Cooper said. 
Cooper said she was grateful to the filmmakers for the respect they showed to her family and their decision to retreat into the background so that the story could speak for itself.
“We had very real questions [about Bland’s death,]” Cooper said. “And what the film does is pick apart those questions in a way that is complex, nuanced and delicate, based [on] the way the information was presented.”
