As we sit at our computers day in and day out, clicking through the digital realm of social interaction that has supplanted phone calls, text messages and even e-mail, most of us rarely stop to think about how it all began. But the same social networking site that serves most students as the ultimate tool for procrastination transformed one college student from a brainy misfit into a billionaire.

Director David Fincher’s new movie, The Social Network, takes us on the controversial journey Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg took throughout the creation and first few years of the website’s existence — at least according to Ben Mezrich.
Since Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay is based on The Accidental Billionaires, Mezrich’s book, for which Zuckerberg was not a source, we can’t exactly be sure how accurate the film is. We can be sure, however, that Mezrich’s “Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal” translates well onto the big screen.
The film begins as Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a computer-savvy Harvard student, rambles with little discretion to his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) about his perfect SAT score and his obsession with being invited into one of Harvard’s elite secret societies known as final clubs.
Pushed over the edge by Zuckerberg’s unbearable arrogance, Erica dumps him, making sure that he knows girls will never like him — not because he’s a nerd, but because he’s a jerk.
As Zuckerberg sprints back to his dorm room to get revenge via the Internet, the audience is told that it’s fall of 2003 at Harvard University.
Facebook has yet to be invented, but its origins take root that night as Zuckerberg spitefully blogs about Erica and takes his anger out on the entire female population at Harvard by hacking into school directories to create a website where visitors can choose which one of two female students is more attractive. The website gets so many hits that it causes the entire network to crash.
This slightly drunken stunt not only earns Zuckerberg academic probation, but also notoriety around campus and the attention of the Olympic-bound Winklevoss twins (played by Josh Pence and Armie Hammer) who recruit Zuckerberg to assist with the programming of a Harvard-exclusive dating site they’ve been developing.
It is Zuckerberg’s agreement to work with the “Winklevi,” as he calls them, that lands him in one of the two lawsuits that serve as the framework of the film — the other brought on by his former roommate and best friend, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).
The remainder of the movie jumps back and forth between the court hearings and Zuckerberg’s neverending attempts to impress Erica with his quickly spreading online phenomenon, revealing a very human — yet oddly inhumane —  face behind the book.
Eisenberg portrays the almost mythical Zuckerberg persona to the tee, his snarky social awkwardness bringing a few laughs into the otherwise very serious conference room scenes.
“Did I adequately answer your condescending question?” he asks the Winklevoss’ lawyer at one point.
The rest of the young cast is also very strong, including Justin Timberlake as Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who gives Zuckerberg a taste of the rock star life that he too could lead if he takes Parker’s advice about what was originally called thefacebook.com. Zuckerberg does just that when Parker tells him to “drop the ‘the.’ Just Facebook — it’s cleaner.”
Fincher’s direction of the carefully selected cast complements Sorkin’s writing well, as both infuse their masterful telling of the story with the perfect mix of drama and wit, a story that serves as a commentary on an entire generation of technology-obsessed individuals.
Even the detailed computer programming depicted at the film’s start — not something easily made interesting on screen — is executed flawlessly. The programming scenes’ quickened pace as Zuckerberg punches out the indecipherable code is paired with electronic music demonstrating Zuckerberg’s mental superiority rather effectively.
Even more powerful, however, are the moments when Zuckerberg’s fingers are not tapping away on the keys that have made him the youngest billionaire in the world, but rather when he is face-to-face with his friends, rivals and ex-girlfriend. It is in these scenes that filmmakers reveal the great irony that surrounds Zuckerberg’s life: He created a site to bring people together, but in doing so pushed all those closest to him away.
Almost as brilliant as its protagonist, The Social Network provides us with an intimate glimpse into Zuckerberg’s previously well-concealed life, a glimpse not unlike the one the Facebook CEO has provided us into the lives of all those whose friend requests we have accepted, those whose pictures, posts and private thoughts anxiously await our review.
who cares about these two. we want to know who the girl is within the blue gown
I can’t wait to see this movie, especially considering all of the reviews have been glowing. When reading the review on the LA Times, I also stumbled on the review for The Freebie. It looks really interesting, especially since its about relationships and fidelity plus it got really great reviews from Sundance earlier this year. I honestly don’t know what I would do if I was allowed to take a one night freebie from my relationship but hopefully I’ll figure it out when watching. Its going to be an awesome movie going weekend!
This review made me want to see the movie. Great! Doinnnn itttt… ha!

Now that the Trojans have finished off the appetizer portion of their schedule, the real fun begins. And by real fun, I mean real challenges.
Stuffed · Senior tailback Allen Bradford and the Trojans had plenty of trouble last season against Oregon on Halloween night, losing 47-20. USC lost four conference games last season — the most it has lost since 2001 — and faces an equally tough schedule this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
Technically, USC opened Pac-10 play last week, but that was against Washington State — so for convenience, let’s just say conference play starts next week.
Have you seen the other eight teams that make up the Trojans’ Pac-10 competition? If you’re watching or reading ESPN, where there’s the Southeastern Conference and then everybody else, you probably don’t hear much about these West Coast teams.
But if this column doesn’t fill you in about the potency of the Pac-10, I’m guessing you will find out on your own soon enough.
At the top are the two teams who unsurprisingly gave USC its two most embarrassing losses last season.
No. 4 Oregon has put up more points than anybody else in the nation. Those who thought the Ducks’ highlight-reel offense would skip a beat without quarterback Jeremiah Masoli are eating their words. These guys still can still light up the scoreboard.
Darron Thomas has done just fine as quarterback, making the Ducks the most feared offense in the conference. They’ve blasted defenses for 231 points in four games, giving up just 44.
Next comes No. 9 Stanford, which cracked the top 10 for the first time this season and is as highly ranked at this point in the season as it has ever been. Quarterback Andrew Luck has lived up to the hype so far, outplaying just about everybody signal-caller in the Pac-10.
Stanford blanked UCLA 35-0, then went to South Bend and pounded the Irish 37-14. Coach Jim Harbaugh has the Cardinals playing staunch defense to complement Luck and the passing attack.
With Oregon and Stanford clearly the teams to beat, how the rest of the league lines up is anybody’s guess.
As far as the rankings go, next up is No. 14 Arizona, another team that got the best of USC last season.
The Wildcats’ signature 34-27 win came against Iowa when the Hawkeyes were ranked No. 9. Arizona almost had a letdown last week against California but eked out a 10-9 victory.
In what has become a Pac-10 trend, another young and talented quarterback, Nick Foles, leads the Wildcats. Foles has completed almost 75 percent of his passes en route to a 4-0 record.
Oregon State is the best unranked Pac-10 team, mostly because of its nonconference schedule that involved games against the two best non-BCS schools in the nation — No. 3 Boise State and No. 5 Texas Christian University. The Beavers lost 30-21 to TCU in a neutral site game that was more like a home game for the Horned Frogs — it was played in Arlington, Texas — then had to go on the road to play Boise State, where they fell 37-24.
Oregon State played both schools tough, so despite its 1-2 record, my guess is few Pac-10 teams are looking forward to visiting Corvallis this season (I’m looking at you, USC).
Arizona State is no slouch either, just a PAT away from going to overtime with No. 11 Wisconsin. The Sun Devils also made Oregon look mortal last week in a 42-31 loss.
Washington has underachieved so far based on preseason expectations, which were probably a little too high to begin with. But they still have quarterback Jake Locker. Despite nonconference losses to Brigham Young University and Nebraska, expect coach Steve Sarkisian to fare much better against familiar Pac-10 schools.
UCLA would have been lumped right there with Washington State at the beginning of this column had it not pulled off a stunning (and dominant) 34-12 win against then-No. 7 Texas.
The Bruins seem like they finally know how to pull the trigger on their pistol offense. After starting 0-2, it looked like another one of those years for the boys in Westwood, but the wins against Houston and Texas changed everything.
Then there’s Cal, which looked like it might join the Cougars at the dregs of the conference before playing Arizona tough last Saturday.
From here on out, there is no game in which the Trojans can just pencil in a victory and mail in a half-hearted performance. Starting with Washington this week at the Coliseum, every Saturday will be a fight.
Even an unsanctioned USC would struggle to make ends meet in this league. The conference is just that good this year.
Obviously, this trend didn’t come from out of the blue. USC lost four games last year against conference foes and has slipped up against weaker Pac-10 teams consistently for the previous three seasons.
In such a deep conference, anybody really could beat anybody, and you probably wouldn’t be that surprised. So the message for USC is simple.
Look out.
“Middle Ground” runs Tuesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Josh at jjovanel@usc.edu.
Correction: 9/28/10: A previous version of this story listed Nate Costa, not Darron Thomas, as the starting quarterback for the Oregon Ducks. This entry has been changed to reflect the change.
Check your reporting. The Duck’s starting QB is Darron Thomas, not Nate Costa.
Is it uphill from here?

The No. 13 USC men’s golf team got off to a rough start Sunday at the Ping/Golfweek Fall Preview in Stillwater, Okla., but managed to pull it together for the second day of competition.
Fighting on · Sophomore Martin Trainer beat his 7-over-par 79 Sunday with a 3-over-par 75 in the second round of play Monday. Although his Trojan squad is currently in last place, the team shot 26 strokes better on Monday than Sunday. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
After shooting a 43-over-par 331 on Sunday — enough to place the Trojans last in a competitive 15-team field — the entire team saw drastic improvement Monday. The team shot a 17-over-par 305 — 26 strokes fewer than day one.
Still, the Trojans remain in 15th place in the tournament at a 60-over-par 636, seven strokes behind 14th place Texas Christian University and 52 behind first place Oklahoma State.
After being forced to withdraw from the competition with hip problems on Sunday, sophomore T.J. Vogel came back strong for the Trojans on Monday, leading the team and shooting a 2-over-par 74 with two birdies, despite lingering effects from the injury.
“T.J played very well today even though he was injured,” said sophomore Martin Trainer. “He can barely swing a club.”
Vogel is not eligible for individual ranking because of his withdrawal on Sunday, but a 74 gives him the lowest score of any Trojan at the tournament.
Trainer had a similarly strong day, finishing four strokes less than Sunday at 3-over-par 75, enough to bump him up to 45th place.
“My round, personally, was up and down,” Trainer said. “It was frustrating because I’d have a really good stretch and then a bad stretch. This course is kicking our butts. There was a lot of wind — it was getting up to around 25 miles per hour.”
Trainer’s scorecard shows four birdies in addition to four bogeys and one double bogey.
Sophomore Stewart Hagestad and freshman Jeffery Kang both shot for 6-over-par 78, with Hagestad improving by one stroke (after a 7-over-par 79 on Sunday) and Kang by three (after a 9-over-par 81) to land at 54th and 60th, respectively.
Hagestad played consistently on the first nine, matching all but one of his bogeys with a birdie. He had less luck on the back nine, losing five strokes on two double bogeys and a bogey.
Kang had a much tougher round, hitting one birdie, five bogeys and two double bogeys in the first 17 holes before finally scoring the Trojans’ only eagle on the last hole.
Sophomore Sam Smith, the fourth member of the Trojan contingent, improved his score with a 9-over-par 81, an 11-stroke difference from his 20-over-par 92 performance on Sunday. Smith has sat in 73rd place both rounds.
Despite a tough two rounds, the team remains optimistic.
“We hung tough. We went out and tried our hardest, and put up a couple decent scores,” Trainer said. “We know how talented we are, and that all of us can do a lot better. We look forward to the next round, and the next tournament. This was a wake-up call, and we can finally look at what we need to do to improve.”
The Trojans will compete in round three today, after which they have a two-week break before facing Ohio State in Columbus, Ohio.

Not much should impress Arthur Bartner. In the 40 years he’s stood on the ladder as the director of the USC Marching Band, The Spirit of Troy, he and his band have appeared in Oscar-winning movies and on platinum albums — not to mention performances at the Grammys and Academy Awards.

But when George Schweitzer, president of marketing at CBS and USC parent, called and proposed the idea of having The Spirit of Troy star in a promotional video for the new incarnation of Hawaii Five-O, he presented something new for the marching band.
“The thing that really perked my interest is that this is a music video where the band’s really the star,” Bartner said. “This is the band playing this iconic theme that everybody knows. The idea of doing a music video featuring the band, I’m going, ‘This is pretty cool here.’ This is really something the band’s never done.”
Brett Padelford, a USC alumnus and current Spirit of Troy member, said the video fits into a new corner of media for the band.
“It’s a hybrid. It’s a music video and a TV promo and it’s an iconic theme song. It was unique,” Padelford said.
Bartner said yes, and The Spirit of Troy prepared for a shoot that took the band from Cromwell Field to the beaches of Hawaii.
Just four days before band camp started, Bartner and 40 members of the band set up shop in one of the recently completed sound stages at the School of Cinematic Arts. There, they recorded a new version of the Hawaii Five-0 theme, specifically arranged by Tony Fox, the associate director and arranger for the band.
For Fox, the new arrangement meant a chance to put a new spin on a personal favorite.
“Mort Stevens, the fellow who wrote it, to us arrangers and composers, he’s like a god,” Fox said.
The original Hawaii Five-O ran 12 seasons on CBS between 1968 and 1980. With each season, the theme changed slightly, so Fox searched through the different recordings and picked the one he liked the best — the standard version Stevens wrote.
Fox then translated the music from an orchestra piece to one better suited for a marching band.
“There’s a lot of woodwind leads in the original, a lot of clarinet stuff, and that doesn’t work that well for marching band because the brass dominates the marching band,” Fox said. “There’s a couple licks in the original that are really, really difficult. So I modified it down slightly so you’d still get the flavor of what the lick was, but the band would be able to negotiate it better.”
The next morning, CBS and its promotional team brought their cameras to shoot a portion of the band performing the song on Cromwell Field. At the end of the day, as they spelled out a “5-0,” a helicopter flew overhead, capturing it all.
“Everything was first class,” Bartner said. “They were the best guys at CBS.”
When the seniors in The Spirit of Troy traveled to Honolulu for the Sept. 2 game against the University of Hawai’i, they filmed for two more days. At 7 a.m. on the morning of the game, the band donned USC Hawaiian shirts and met the CBS crew on Waikiki Beach, where they marched through the water and sand playing the tune.
On Sept. 3, while some of the band enjoyed a free day in Hawaii, a handful of members drove to the North Shore. Generally regarded as one of the best surf spots in the world, it was home to the set of Lost, meaning it was familiar location for one of the Hawaii Five-0 stars present that day — Daniel Dae Kim. Grace Park (Battlestar Galactica), who plays Kim’s cousin on the show, also joined them to shoot a comedic opening for the video.
“They had to take a day off just to come do this promotional thing,” Padelford said. “But they were really cool. They talked to us for a little while and met us.”
The video has appeared on local news stations and on The Early Show, and has spread thanks to YouTube.

“When you get into these things, you never know what kind of legs it has,” Bartner said. “Now it’s all over the world.”
Now Bartner and the band are trying to bring it back home to USC. Given they can find the right theme for the half time show, they hope to play the song during the Nov. 6 game against Arizona State.
Hawaii Five-0 seems to have benefited from the help of The Spirit of Troy. On Sept. 20, it premiered to an audience of over 14 million viewers.
“I guess we did our job,” Bartner said.
The Spirit of Troy benefited from the video as well. Those who hire the band for appearances must donate to its scholarship fund. CBS and Schweitzer gave $25,000 for the promotion.
“People say, ‘Why do you do all this stuff?’ You do it because it’s fun, ’cause the kids like it, you think you’re rock ‘n’ roll stars or something. But the bottom line is, you make money for band scholarships,” Bartner said. “It all goes back to the students.”
A very good question – why no link?
why would you not link to the video?

Tyler Demorest — a music industry major and lead singer of the band Kiven — was once an outcast searching for friends and meaning. But hey, weren’t we all at the age of 12?
Today, Demorest is still searching, but his findings are expressed fully through music. Originally from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., Demorest moved up north at the age of 12, where loneliness manifested itself in melody. The melancholy of his initial transfer, however, was short-lived as he made connections with other musicians.
“One thing lead to another and my trusty old $100 Squire Guitar became my best friend, and I played for hours upon hours,”  Demorest said. “Once school started, I was lucky enough to find that all the kids in my grade started playing music around the same time. We were all quite competitive.”
While playing Little League baseball, Demorest came in contact with Teddy Boldt. Boldt would later invite Demorest to join a group called DES, until the two opted out to start their own group called The Cavalry.
This experiment in heavy metal proved to be therapeutic for its members, as they plucked power chords into maturity. Demorest speaks quite self-deprecatingly about the experience now.
“We had plenty of 15-year-old teenage angst to scream about,”  he said.
Nonetheless, it was through this musical introspection that Demorest came into himself and began to approach music as a career instead of a side project.
“That band is where the roots of my desire to do music for the rest of my life really sprouted,”  Demorest said.
After his admission into USC, Demorest and Boldt brought in Danny Schnair and Matt Cohen to round out the positions in what is now Kiven (Kee-vehn), a rock group dedicated to superb live performance and lyrical pathos.
Kiven released its first EP, Searching for Home, in 2008 and followed it up with Two In The Same in April of this year. This summer, the band went on a sabbatical of sorts in Sonoma, Calif., conveying Bon Iver-esque methods of songwriting.
“We all share the same vision for the group and are committed to making that dream of ours happen,” Demorest said.
When listening to Kiven, each musician seems to be expressing himself separately. No single member is ever drowned out or overshadowed. The layering of vocals and the shifting tempos allow for reliance on one another, and a shared sound that is immersive. The cinematic quality of their music is also apparent. It’s something to get lost in.
But what sets Kiven apart from the thousands of other indie-rock hopefuls in Los Angeles?
With the technology that permeates our society today, people have greater opportunities to cut EPs and even full albums independently of managers, agents and labels. One can record and mix tracks in Logic or Protools, Photoshop a design, purchase a domain and upload a band identity online in a single weekend. Then, without breaking a sweat, that link can be sent to 1,000 or more digital friends, who will “like” and support that endeavor. It is truly the do-it-yourself age.
Yet, although technology creates an abundance of opportunity, nothing is ever guaranteed. If anything, it has only raised the standards for quality and cluttered the desks of studio executives searching for that next big name. We cannot be the generation of entitlement that lives at a manic pace and therefore expects overnight success. Technology opens doors, but it takes more than an open door to construct what stands around it.
In this world, there are two attitudes that people tend to live by: the “rent” attitude and the “mortgage” attitude.
When you rent an apartment, your money seems to disappear into intangible places. An apartment is temporary. A home, on the other hand is permanent. Your mortgage on a house is a tangible investment toward ownership.
Therefore, those who view life in terms of “mortgage” see every job, every connection and every band practice as an investment in the ultimate dream. Those who see life in terms of “rent” imbue negativity into their actions and will likely settle or give up. In an industry defined by luck and timing, attitude should also be accounted for, because it is at the heart of true passion.
For Demorest and his team, every venue is Radio City Music Hall. They are optimistic about the state of the industry, despite drastic changes in the way albums are bought and sold, and are humbled by supportive audiences.
“The exciting part is that the ability to make professional quality music is becoming easier and easier,” Demorest said. “There is still a lot of music that is made every day with the right intentions.”
Nothing is mechanical or insincere about Kiven, which is what makes the group’s live performances so involving. It is passion for the band’s art that separates it, for every time it takes the stage, whether at Ground Zero or The Grove, the members of Kiven are clearly living the dream.

In the age of computer screens and two-minute YouTube videos, it might be easy for some people to assume that reading is on life support. With so much information and entertainment just a few clicks away, sitting down and taking the time to read a book often seems old-fashioned and even time-consuming.
But thanks to events such as the West Hollywood Book Fair, held Sunday near the Pacific Design Center, the print industry is not only continuing to thrive on its own but is also incorporating itself into the future of online literary interpretation.
Since 2002, the West Hollywood Book Fair has drawn huge crowds from across California thanks to its ever-expanding list of authors and celebrities,writing workshops for all ages and genres, poetry readings and dramatic performances.
What started as a small non-profit organization intended to serve as a holding ground for literary enthusiasts trapped in a film-dominated industry has grown into a yearly tradition for absolutely anything book-related.
This year, the fair had 14 venues and stages ranging from the comics and graphic novels pavilion to the current events pavilion to two separate kids and teen reading stages, and even a ghost storytelling Tent.
Roz Helfand, the event’s coordinator, claimed the fair started with a just a few small booths and venues in 2002. It expanded after the fair grew in popularity, adding appearances from special guests and showcasing a wider variety of literary genres.
This year, the guest list included Molly Ringwald, James Ellroy, Mark Doty and USC creative writing professor Aimee Bender.
“I’ve always considered the West Hollywood Book Fair a sister of the Los Angeles Times Book Festival,” said Bender who was promoting her book, The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake.
But the West Hollywood Book Fair’s slightly smaller environment makes for a unique and personal atmosphere for each guest — no matter how old they are or how many books they have read.
Guests were greeted with a free pamphlet detailing the festival’s packed schedule of events, interviews and readings. Teenagers from public Los Angeles high schools gave poetry readings on the designated Teen Stage in front of a packed audience. Theater troupes performed monologues and recited slam poetry on the theater stage. Expert mythologist Maja D’Aoust read a spooky story to anxious kids huddling in a circle in the Ghost Storytelling Tent.
The highlight of the entire fair, however, was the SciFi, Fantasy and Horror Pavilion, which was made up of 30 booths dedicated to the genre. Events included H.P. Lovecraft live-action role playing, a discussion panel with vampire and werewolf writers, and a Star Wars reading with actor Shawn Crosby.
Walking through this section was a spectacle in itself, with performers dressed in elaborate costumes posing for pictures and handing out promotional fliers as if they had arrived directly from Comic-Con.
For those with more traditional tastes, the Fiction, Open Book and Good Reads pavilions hosted panel discussions and workshops on topics as the state of the publishing industry, memoir writing, screenwriting, blogging and gender.
The fair will be a decade old next fall, but the enthusiasm the crowd showed for literature ensures that it will be around a long time.

College students are often in a position to be the loudest voice promoting humanitarian and charitable endeavors. Still, it’s only natural that the academic environment is equally infused with students’ own self-interests. In college we’re so intensely focused on our majors, internships, finances, networking and futures that it’s easy to forget about any sort of philanthropy.
Alice Li | Daily Trojan
It’s especially important in this setting to recognize the benefits of altruism, especially when those practicing it are some of the wealthiest and most successful in our country. What we need is a role model or an organizational guideline from which we can learn how to incorporate philanthropy into our daily lives, and, as we leave college and become more independent, how to carry it with us into our futures.
In May 2009, highly successful investor Warren Buffett, business magnate Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates, a noted philanthropist, gathered a dozen of the wealthiest Americans to discuss their experiences with philanthropy. None of the participants (who included David Rockefeller, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, media mogul Ted Turner, real estate tycoon Eli Broad and TV host Oprah Winfrey) could have known quite what to expect of the gathering.
Over the course of the three-hour summit, 12 stories about philanthropy were told by 12 different individuals.
As each person recalled his own experiences, all parties, Bill Gates  began thinking about expanding the concept. Buffet and the Gates held two more dinners, one in Seattle and another in Menlo Park, Calif. At some point during these gatherings, the idea of the Giving Pledge was born.
Since then, Buffet and the Gates have been on a recruitment search to fulfill the Pledge’s mission — to “invite the wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit to giving the majority of their wealth to philanthropy,” according to givingpledge.org.
As of Aug. 4, 2010, 40 American families and individuals have pledged to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. The Giving Pledge is not a legal contract. Rather, it is a moral commitment. There aren’t any guidelines or a mandatory set of causes. The pledge encourages participants to contribute to causes that they personally believe are the most worthwhile.
Describing the motivation for the openness of the Giving Pledge, Melinda Gates cited the words of Australian philosopher and Princeton professor Peter Singer: “we do what our reference does” — meaning, what we see determines how we act.
The lesson that needs to be drawn from the Giving Pledge is not that one should make so much money that the only thing to do with it is give it away, or that one must be a billionaire — the Pledge’s target demographic — before one can give to a cause.
Instead, as students still building our futures, we should be aware of our own pre-existing capacity to give.
Through donations and volunteering, engaging in philanthropy “(sensitizes you) to what you can do in this world,” said Buffet in a June interview with Charlie Rose.
Moreover, thinking about philanthropy on such a level as the Giving Pledge now will prepare students for when they are in a better position to give in the future. What people are driven by in life is what drives them to give. Thinking about how and why to give back now ensures that one is able to do so effectively later.
The decision to give back in any form requires taking a leap of faith, which is often hampered by the apparent enormity of some of today’s greatest world problems.
But, according to Bill Gates, ours is  the “first generation that these issues are solvable … these things are within reach.” The money accumulated by the Giving Pledge might become the tipping point, both in how philanthropy is perceived and in its return on investment.
The families and individuals who have made this pledge deserve recognition and greater publicity so that more might follow in their footsteps. Their stories will hopefully inspire other billionaires — and even a few college students —  to think about their own capacity to give.

For those of you who attended Zeta Beta Tau’s Passion Pit event Saturday, you might have a nice recollection of lines filled with scantily clad girls, separate bars for men and women, and 100 percent or more ticket price inflation for the fellas.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
It struck me while listening to a DJ set of music chosen by Passion Pit that this night served as a microcosm of Millennials content with the sexual double standard.
We all know the historical saga of sexual liberation, from Susan B. Anthony to the bra burners and everything in between. But before you jump the page for fear of a feminist rant, let me say that this is not my aim.
What I’m noticing in this generation, particularly among young women, is a break from the pleas for equality.
Although the struggles of generations before us for equal voting rights or occupational consideration were not in vain, the women of today have grown comfortable with this state of equality.
Moreover, women are now taking advantage of their status, which begs the question of whether true equality is still a desired goal. There’s a new kind of sexism in town, one where women enjoy the perks of the double standard as opposed to being offended that standard.
As college students, different treatment is afforded to women on a daily basis. Events catering to the ladies, such as ZBT’s show, are a dime a dozen — and you don’t hear girls complaining.
After all, why would we be upset for enjoying less red velvet tape and a slightly more affordable college experience?
If you’ve ever caught a glimpse of a game of intramural soccer on the USC campus, you might have noticed the majority of women running the field. This might be because of a rising interest in field games among women, but could also be because of a league rule that calls for at least two female players on the field at all times to avoid a forfeit.
With women in equal standing in so many aspects of modern culture, I wonder if we are dropping the ball in the final quarter for the sake of convenience.
What about this treatment is necessary and fair?  USC is a progressive campus that long ago made strides for equal footing between men and women. I don’t think female students are crying out for crutches, but they certainly aren’t rejecting the advantages thrown their way.
Statutes like Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in any program or activity at any educational institution, have grown increasingly archaic. I can’t imagine girls storming Cromwell Field with pitchforks and torches if, heaven forbid, we had a men’s soccer team as well as a women’s one. Gender balance in athletics isn’t exactly a make it or break it point when it comes down to school pride.
I think we can all agree that for the most part, the population of women picketing for equal opportunities and treatment has significantly diminished.
True, that’s partly because we’ve reached many of the milestones for which our predecessors fought, but it’s also because a culture of suffragettes has given way to one where the double standard often benefits women — and where we enjoy it.
But now I think it’s worth asking, who is advocating for the men? We are so often barraged with the statistics of women who are victims of discrimination. Rarely do we hear about the men who are victimized —  or if we do, it’s disproportionate to the reality of the incident.
So rest easy, fearers of the all-mighty stereotypical feminist; I think the troops have moved on out for now.
Consider this next time you’re at an event where men are hopping fences for entry and girls are getting the VIP treatment: Is equality still the objective?

oh my god, I was at that party, and I was totally thinking the same thing. I totally had a sad face for my guy friends when I saw how much they had to pay. I was telling my friend Lydia how sad it was, but she said some things that made me think. 
She said that all this fun and like, the advantages we women are enjoying today are, like reparations for all the bad treatment women have endured over the years. Women had no rights and stuff, and in the past they were treated like property, working in the field. They had to gather berries in the wild and there were no hospitals, so they had to squat down and have a baby, like right there. It was really hard, cuz they had to keep picking berries, but also carry a heavy baby, too. We don’t have to do that stuff now, because of laws and feminism, so it is our duty to enjoy special privelages for all the women in the past, that had to have field babies.
I don’t feel so bad for men any more, cuz nature moves in cycles, and now is the cycle for women. I think it will get better when we elect senator Palin as the first woman president. Then we can go to other countries and correct them, like in sex in the city 2. We women have to think about the future, but when I am doing a keg stand and feel Guilty, I shut my eyes and instead of thinking of my guy friends who didn’t make it to the party, I think of those field babies and how I have to chug my share, for all the sisters. 
Also, Don’t listen to these haters, fight on girl!
this is genius.
4 for you glen coco
I honestly think you need to do more research on this because equality is not even remotely close to being the reality. The fact of the matter is that maybe women get preferential treatment on Frat Row BECAUSE they are scantily clad and ultimately get into parties for the possibility of sex. Other men are not able to get into parties because they are competition for these same girls. I just think you have not seen enough of the world or really understood cultural dynamics in terms of gender relations and the fact that you are a woman writing this just makes me think of the “female complacency” that John Stuart Mill wrote about. Honestly, you should be embarrassed as a representation of this generation and as a woman making these statements based on the Greek system, which is inherently misogynistic.
Great article.  Keep up the good work.  There is a small but growing minority advocating for men on the Title IX thing.
“As college students, different treatment is afforded to women on a daily basis.”
proof other than a concert at a frat?
ugh i hate your writing style

Supporters of the tea party movement rallied in Beverly Hills Sunday to protest the Obama administration’s stance on a variety of issues ranging from illegal immigration to race relations.
The rally was organized by singer and actor Pat Boone and featured conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart as one of about a dozen speakers. Others included film industry professionals as well as local religious and political leaders. The speeches consistently criticized the current administration as well as the mainstream media for allegedly having a liberal bias.
Among those in the crowd were actress Alana Stewart and former Saturday Night Live cast member Victoria Jackson. The majority of those present at the rally tended to be older, although the Bruin Republicans, a political student organization from UCLA, set up a fundraising booth selling “capitalism cupcakes”.
“It’s hard to find support for Republicans on the Westside,” Anneliese Mondorf, one of the members of the Bruin Republicans, said to the Los Angeles Times.

Just days after publicly ripping former disciple Reggie Bush for his handling of the Heisman Trophy controversy, second-year Washington Huskies coach Steve Sarkisian spoke a much different tune of his previous stomping grounds during a Monday morning conference call.
“In my opinion they are the most talented football team in our conference from top to bottom,” Sarkisian, who spent seven seasons as an assitance coach at USC, said.
Currently heading in to this weekend’s showdown with Washington at the Coliseum, No. 18 USC trails Pac-10 foes No. 4 Oregon, No. 9 Stanford and No. 14 Arizona in the AP Top 25 Poll.
The Huskies’ coach — who is 6-9 in his young tenure in Seattle — also didn’t shy away from bestowing praise upon his friend and former colleague, Lane Kiffin.
“He’s done a nice job, I think we’ve done a nice job,” Sarkisian said. “These are both jobs we thought were special ones, especially in the Pac-10. It’s a unique experience, this early in our careers, to be facing each other in such a pivotal ball game in the Pac-10 race.”
For Sarkisian, pulling off a second-straight upset against his previous employer will be arduous task to say the least. The Huskies come in to town off a much-needed bye week, following an ugly defeat at the hands of No. 6 Nebraska, 56-21.

It’s time to read.
To be more specific, it’s time to read something seditious — it’s Banned Books Week.
Organized by groups including the American Library Association, the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and the American Booksellers Association, the event is designed to celebrate the First Amendment and the freedom to read. Running through Oct. 2, the main events are hosted in Chicago, but nationwide celebrations of the power of literature are going on at bookstores and libraries across the country.
Launched in 1982, the Banned Books Week works to ensure that all books avoid censorship of any kind. The featured books have all been banned at some point or another in their publication history, for “sexual content” or for simply being offensive to certain areas. Some of the works include Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, J.D. Salinger’s A Catcher in the Rye and more recent works like J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series.

With temperatures soaring into the triple-digits today, and near record-breaking temperatures across Southern California this weekend, area firefighters are concerned that wildfires could break out in the coming days.
A fire broke out in South Pasadena last night — about 20 miles away from USC . The firefighters in that area, however, were prepared and caught it in time. The fire only managed to consume about two acres of heavy brush, but did not damage any homes.
It is expected that the weather remain in the high 90 degrees for this week in Downtown while it could surpass 100 degrees in the Valley. Red-flag fire warnings are expected to remain in place for the duration of the week.

This weekend, the two players representing the women’s tennis team at the Cal Nike Invitational, seniors Cristala Andrews and Lyndsay Kinstler, had little luck in finding an early rhythm.
Playing in flight A, the Women of Troy did not make it past the first few rounds of competition.
In singles play, Andrews defeated Santa Clara University’s Kelly Lamble (1-6, 6-1, 6-1) and moved from the round of 32 to the round of 16. There, however, Natallia Pintusava, a top-ranked freshman from Minnesota, ended Andrews’ movement up in the competition.
Also in singles play, Kinstler was defeated by Anais Dallara, a highly ranked player from Long Beach State, in the round of 32. Upon playing BYU’s Megan Price in the consolation round, Kinstler faced a similar loss.
As a doubles pair, the two teammates played against a pair from St. Mary’s College in the round of 32 and lost 8-2. They fared no better in the consolation round where they were handed a loss from the University of the Pacific’s Jenifer Widjaja and Julia Hansen.
The two USC players found hope in the round robin singles set. They both beat their first competitors and moved up in the round-robin rankings.
Next weekend USC will start competing in the pre-qualifying rounds of the ITA/ Riviera All-American Championships. This is one of the more difficult tournaments of the season, and the Women of Troy’s performance in it is crucial more toward their individual rankings than the team’s ranking as a whole.

The No. 1 Women’s golf team rode an excellent final round to a tie for third place at the Mason Rudolph Championship in Franklin, Tenn.
The team fired a 10-under-par 278 in the final round to finish at 13-under 851 (286-287- 278) at the Legends Golf Club. That final round was tied with No. 16 LSU’s first round for the lowest in the tournament, and it brought the team up from its eighth place position to start the
day.
“We didn’t have a fast start, but the team stayed focused,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said. “It was great to see the girls rally.”
The round — 10-under par — is the best in Gaston’s USC career, tied with last season’s first round at the Mason Rudolph. USC’s history of success here is promising because the Legends Golf Club will host the 2012 NCAA championship.
The Women of Troy were led by junior transfer Lisa McCloskey, who finished in a tie for fourth at 5-under-par 209 (70-72-67). Her final round was the team’s lowest of the tournament, featuring only one bogey amid six birdies. McCloskey, a two-time All-American at Pepperdine, now has two straight fourth place finishes in her first two tournaments for the Women of Troy.
Senior Lizette Salas bounced back from a rough first round to finish tied for 21st at 2- under-par 214 (76-68-70). Two bogeys in her last four holes undid a good first nine for her final round, but she birdied 18 to get back to 2-under on the day. Salas, going for a program record fourth All-American award this season, has never finished lower than 25th in her four appearances at the Mason Rudolph.
Junior Inah Park finished her season debut tied for 23rd at 1-under-par 215 (71-75-69). Park closed strong in the final round, birdying 17 and 18 after as part of a 3-under round.
Sophomore Cyna Rodriguez finished tied for 26th at even-par 216 (72-72-72) in a remarkably consistent tournament. Three bogeys on the front nine were balanced by three birdies on the back nine in her final round.
Rounding out the team’s roster was freshman Rachel Morris, who tied for 78th at 14-over-par 230 (73-76-81). Morris couldn’t overcome two double bogeys during her final round that is her worst in two tournaments for USC.
Gaston said she was proud of her team for rallying despite the 13-stroke deficit it faced after the second round.
“They were locked in and focused on each and every shot,” Gaston said.
The Women of Troy put on a show for the final nine holes, where the top four members of the team combined to go 10-under on the back nine to close the tournament.
“They played lights out,” Gaston said.
The Women of Troy now have eight days before going back on the road and heading to the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational at the Tacoma Country Club in Tacoma, Wash from Oct. 4-6.

A trip to the Pacific Northwest proved to be a challenging task for the USC women’s soccer team, but it managed to continue its recent string of strong play, coming away with two hard-fought victories in Washington.
In the first game of their road trip, the Women of Troy came away with a 2-1 victory over the Gonzaga Bulldogs in sudden death overtime, but the victory was no walk in the park.
“We just came out really flat in the first half and Gonzaga took it to us,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We fell behind and we had to make some changes to the lineup, but the ladies responded well. We came back, created some good opportunities and we were able to put them away.”
In the first half, USC faced an early deficit after the Bulldogs broke through for a goal in the 33rd minute.
The second half would be a lot different, however, as the Women of Troy created plenty of scoring opportunities, finally breaking through in the 68th minute when freshman midfielder Elizabeth Eddy scored on a breakaway, tying the game at one goal apiece.
That same score would stand until the end of regulation, forcing the game into overtime and giving USC one more chance to salvage a victory.
Five minutes into the extra period, freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano completed the comeback, heading in a ball off a pass from Eddy, giving the Women of Troy the overtime win. Despite giving up an early goal, the defense recuperated and shut down the Bulldogs’ offense for the rest of the game, giving USC a chance to win it at the end.
“The defense was amazing,” Altamirano said. “They kept us in the game, they cleared the ball and defended really, really well like they do every other game.”
In the second game of their road trip, the Women of Troy found themselves in an early hole yet again but managed to match their highest offensive output of the season in a 5-1 victory over the Eastern Washington Eagles.
The Eagles struck first with a goal in the second minute of play when forward Whitney Brannan knocked in her seventh goal of the year to give her team an early 1-0 lead.
It wasn’t too long before the Women of Troy responded – in the sixth minute, sophomore midfielder Courtney Garcia scored her first goal of the year to even the game at one goal apiece, and in the 11th minute, it was sophomore forward Samantha Johnson who knocked a ball through the posts to give USC a 2-1 lead they would never relinquish.
“We responded well and we didn’t put our heads down,” Garcia said. “We knew we could beat them, so we just went right after them and attacked.”
Freshman midfielder Haley Boysen scored her third goal of the season in the 44th minute, giving the Women of Troy a two-goal lead before halftime.
In the second half, senior defender Karter Haug scored in the 84th minute and Garcia added her second goal of the game to complete the scoring for USC.
Though it was far from easy, the team came away with a sweep of their weekend road trip in the Pacific Northwest.
“I think the ladies are starting to figure out that everybody is fired up to play USC,”
Khosroshahin said. “This weekend, we came up here and took the opposition a little bit lightly and both teams were able to score on us first. Hopefully, we’ve learned from this that everybody is going to put their best foot forward against us.”
Awesome, it’s nice to see the women’s soccer team doing well.  Let’s take it to the competition the entire season.  Keep up the good work ladies.

The beginning of the individual season started off a bit rougher than last season ended, but the USC men’s tennis team made strides as the weekend progressed.
The Trojans participated in the Land Rover Napa Valley Tennis Classic at Meadowood Resort in St. Helena, Calif.
Four USC players made the trip to participate in the 32-man draw, which consisted of 24 collegiate and eight USTA junior players.
The Trojans finished off the weekend with three of four victories. Senior Jaak Poldma defeated Texas’ David Holiner 7-6 (3), 6-4. Freshman JT Sundling beat USTA junior MacKenzie McDonald in a three-set match. Daniel Nguyen won by default over Florida junior Nassim Slilam.
Freshman Ray Sarmiento lost to Kentucky’s Eric Quigley in three sets.
The Trojans showed improvements Saturday as Sundling defeated Kentucky’s Maks Gold 6-0, 6-2, and Poldma lost in a close third set tiebreak to Florida’s Sekou Bangoura.
In the first day of competition, Sarmiento — in his first match as a Trojan — suffered a narrow defeat to conference foe, sophomore Carlos Cueto of California, who won 7-6(6), 7-6(4).
“We were rusty the first day, not super sharp,” said associate head coach George Husack on Friday’s opening matches.
Husack said the junior players seemed to be in better form throughout the weekend because many have been actively playing in tournaments over the summer, while collegiate players had a less strenuous summer following the NCAA tournament.
“Not at the level that the team needs to be at,” Husack said of the team’s performances following the first two days of the tournament. “We can improve focus and execution on the court. This serves us notice; we will get back at work and get better.”
Husack mentioned another factor that might have led to some early struggles, saying that their opponents went into the matches with some extra motivation to play the reigning NCAA champions.
Still, as the season commences, optimism is apparent as the team is beginning to take shape.
“We have a really exciting team this year,” Husack said. “I am excited to see how the team performs over the course of the season.”
Players echoed the sentiments that they did not start off the weekend as expected, but said they felt good about getting back to competitive play on the courts.
“Rough start on the first day, but we have been playing better,” Poldma said. “It’s been a good way to get back to playing tournaments and matches, and see where we need to improve.”
Although the tournament ended without any Trojans advancing from round-robin play, the experience is only the beginning of the long road to the NCAA tournament in May.
“Expectation-wise, you always want to perform well, but the results will not dictate how well we do at the NCAA’s,” Husack said.
