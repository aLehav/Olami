Alex Zarchy was going to major in a pre-med field, but now she’s creating a 46-page coloring book featuring the mesmerizing art and stories of 15 Los Angeles-based artists, intersecting the world of art and social change.
Set to release Thursday, “Snapshot: L.A. Artists” includes multiple works of original art from painters and street artists such as WRDSMTH and Bunnie Reiss to Lucid Morgan and Hedy Torres. Thirty percent of the book’s proceeds go to those artists. 
Zarchy, a sophomore majoring in public relations and NGOs and social change, found her interest in art when she discovered Art Share Los Angeles on a family outing. 
Art Share Los Angeles is a nonprofit art space dedicated to helping local emerging artists of all kinds in their growth, both personally and professionally. What began as an old textile factory in the 1920s is now a not-for-profit with artistic spaces, including 30 affordable housing units for emerging artists, studio spaces and an art gallery with free submissions.
“We walked in, and it was home,” Zarchy said. “I immediately knew that this was where I needed to be spending all of my time, unfortunately for them.” 
With Art Share in her back pocket, Zarchy felt that creating the coloring book and donating the funds to the nonprofit was a large but necessary effort. 
But Zarchy wasn’t in this alone. She had help from co-creator Holly Harris, a sophomore majoring in biology at Texas Christian University. After being sent home from college because of the pandemic, Harris developed the concept for the project and Zarchy seemed like the perfect collaborator. 
“For some reason, the idea of an L.A. artists adult coloring book just kind of popped into my head, and I was like, ‘Wow, this would be so sick,’” Harris said. “I clearly remember I almost didn’t text Alex … But I was like, ‘No, it’s Alexandra. I’m just gonna text her and see what she thinks,’ and here we are. Eight months later.”
When figuring out a direction for the coloring book, Zarchy and Harris wanted to focus on emerging and established artists alike, who make L.A.’s art scene what it is today. 
Choosing Angeleno-based artists to feature in the book was intentional, and so were the causes that the book supported. With Zarchy and Harris’s passion of tackling homelessness in L.A., they decided that 25% of the proceeds would go to the Midnight Mission, a homeless shelter and service provider for those in L.A. Being that Zarchy and Harris will not be profiting off of the book, the remainder of the book’s proceeds, 45%, will be donated to Art Share.
“We really thought that this book was an all-encompassing view of Los Angeles, and since that was the case, the fundraising had to [raise] money for these two really gigantic facets of Los Angeles culture, which is art and unfortunately, homelessness,” Zarchy said. 
Art Share Los Angeles is located in the Arts District, next door to Skid Row, an area that comprises .0001% of L.A. County’s land area yet has 3% of the county’s homeless population.
Being that the Arts District and Skid Row are neighboring areas, artists affected by homelessness would use their creative work as an outlet, painting and artistically cultivating the surrounding areas. 
Though beautiful, many new businesses took the area’s newfound beauty as an entrance for gentrification, pushing out smaller businesses and nonprofits such as Art Share, motivating Zarchy even further to create the coloring book. 
“I think that it’s about supporting the population that made this incredible part of the city what it is while also supporting those people who want to perpetuate that creation and art that is so hard to find in the big businesses that are moving in here,” Zarchy said. 
With that, and the sudden onset of the coronavirus, many businesses in the arts began to sink. Art Share Los Angeles has found ways to raise money with events such as its Home Share virtual performance series, where artists use Art Share’s space for Zoom livestreams, but that didn’t bring in enough funds like its pre-coronavirus operation had.   
While the proceeds from the book will help the organization, Toni Figueredo, Art Share’s gallery coordinator, hopes that the coloring book also engages and teaches audiences about L.A. and its many facets like homlessness. 
“We’re a nonprofit, genuinely fighting to stay alive,” Figueredo said. “So if you can have fun, color, interact, but also get to know that there are problems that you need to wake up about, that’s definitely a fundraiser we wanted to be part of whether it made us money or not.”
Finding artists to contribute to the coloring book was no small feat. Zarchy explained that after a slew of unsuccessful emails, she and Harris took to Instagram to find artists to feature in the book using its effective communication tool, direct messaging. Being sure to find artists who had a presence in L.A. and communicated issues that many Angelenos experience such as homelessness, racism and gentrification, the duo found 15 artists. 
Missing the bustling streets of L.A. and its murals, Zarchy wants the book to epitomize the feeling of seeing this art for the first time and understanding the real-time history of the city being made. So in addition to the artwork, the book includes interviews with the artists explaining what inspired their works. 
“We wanted to make an encapsulation so that people could feel like they were walking around [and] talking to the artists who painted [the art],” Zarchy said. “And understanding what motivated these works that really make L.A. what it is.”
Harris echoed the same sentiments, adding that what makes this book so different from other adult coloring books is the included narrative component and artists’ perspective. 
“What’s interesting is you’re really combining these two different components, which [are] the coloring pages and the art, and then the narrative component of ‘Why did the artist choose to create this art?’” Harris said. “It just makes it so much more interesting to be able to color in this coloring book because you actually know the reason behind it and the motivations, and then you get to make the piece your own further by coloring it.”
Zarchy hopes that art’s infamous pompous label can be diminished by the book’s promotion of art accessibility and affiliation with Art Share. 
“I hope that people become less afraid of art and that art becomes less of a pretentious realm than it has been because art does not just exist within galleries where you need to spend $20 to go visit,” Zarchy said. “Art doesn’t just exist within museums. It exists with so many people in this city. It exists on street walls, it exists in free galleries that are made just to expose people to art, like [Art Share].”
One of the artists featured in the book, Jeremy Novi, who is known best for his stenciled koi fish street art, has a dream of making safe spaces for queer people around L.A. These spaces would create a visual comfort for queer people. Zarchy wants readers to question the availability of these safe spaces for artists and non-artists alike.
“I want people to … walk around and think, ‘Is this a visual safe space?’” Zarchy said. “‘Is this city a visual safe space for everybody who lives here and everyone who inhabits it?’” 
One of the most important pages in the coloring book doesn’t actually have any art on it. The dedication page attributes the book to Cheyanne Sauter, Art Share’s executive director, and someone less expected, Zarchy’s mother. Zarchy lost her mother six years ago and hopes that the book illustrates the importance of her mother’s life on her own.  
“It makes me happy that such a wonderful soul’s name gets to be on this project that brings me so much joy and that she in a way gets to be part of this,” Zarchy said. 
“Snapshot: L.A. Artists” will be available Thursday and can be purchased at ArtShareLA.org, Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

With their anthemic rhythm and accompanying thunderous beats, Nadine Bloch’s lyrics will grab you by the collar and plunge you into a new world of pop. A senior majoring in popular music performance, Nadine is a dynamic singer-songwriter marching her way into the Los Angeles music scene. 
It comes as no surprise that Nadine was drawn to the siren’s call of music when she talks about her love for creating new melodies. 
“I’m like a melodic-based person,” Nadine said. “Melodies come to me so easily. Like all the time, I’ll literally wake up in the middle of the night and have my voice memo out and just record the randomest thing ever.” 
Nadine’s musical beginnings started at age 5 with musical theatre and piano and have grown to be largely influenced by the music she grew up with. 
“Growing up, my parents would always play music from the ’60s and ’70s and Motown,” Nadine said. “And I always loved Motown so much, I was just so inspired by that.” 
As she grew older, Nadine began to branch out into pop melodies. During high school, she joined a band, began writing her own music and traveled throughout Florida performing at festivals, restaurants and other social venues as entertainment. 
“And then my dream was always to go to USC in the popular music program, so I did training for that basically my whole high school [career],” Nadine said. 
Fast forward to today. Nadine is about to graduate in the spring from that very program she aspired to be in, with two singles and multiple industry connections. 
“I got into the program not knowing what to expect, just because with musicians, it can get really cutthroat, especially when you’re in a small program and very competitive,” Nadine said. “But I literally found my best friends in the program.”
Nadine’s creative process is often a collaborative one, integrating the ideas of others she’s met during her time in the popular music program. 
In fact, her newest release, “Three,” a “dark, wavy rock-pop” ballad was one Nadine co-wrote with FUN SUCKR, a band composed of Zoe D’Andrea, a junior majoring in popular music performance, and Samantha Short, a senior majoring in narrative studies and theatre, both of whom she met in USC’s popular music program. “Three” served as their first collaboration and was also “the beginning of our friendship as a trio,” according to FUN SUCKR. 
“We love working with Nadine because she’s always a light in the session and consistently is a positive force,” FUN SUCKR said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
“Three” was born out of the trios’ mutual experiences. Their track centers around a love triangle, but contrary to expectation, the singer is the one inviting the triangle. Listeners will find elements of rock and, if they listen hard enough, undertones of trap. The alluring chorus sings “You, him, me, in the middle of a devil’s dream.” 
“This song is not for the heartbroken but the heartbreakers,” Nadine said. “I wrote it from the perspective of me being in a relationship and then having my eyes on someone else.” 
Her release dives into the female perspective, as a call to those who find themselves with their foot on the gas pedal rather than taking the back seat in their relationships.
“We literally wrote it in one night,” Nadine said. “We drank like the crappiest wine we could find at the Cal-mart next door to our apartment.” 
As the three drank to shared sorrows and lost connections, the song took form. “Three” not only balanced multiple perspectives on love triangles but also powerful vocals with a forceful background track.
 “[‘Three’] was just so important to us that we weren’t going to settle for the normal harmonies, we wanted to make it explode,” Nadine said. 
Nadine’s writing mimics a juggling act, often weaving threads of rock into her pop beats. 
Before the coronavirus pandemic, Nadine participated in weekly performances as a part of the popular music program, and rock was one of her favorite genres to perform. These performances offered a taste of what Nadine’s world could look like beyond graduation. Surrounded by friends and family, one of the singer’s favorite songs to perform was “Barracuda” by Heart. 
“It’s literally an aggressive rock song, something that I’d really never delved into,” Nadine said. “But pop made me go into that genre. [That] song really did it for me. I felt like a badass.” 
The pop artist’s performances empower her, and listeners will find her songs do the same for them. Even Nadine’s first release — “My Way” — rings of female empowerment. 
“It was like, let’s write a female empowerment … don’t-talk-to-me-at-the-club kind of song … unless you want something real,” said Alexis Kesselman, Nadine’s producer and co-writer. “I just don’t feel like I’ve heard that many songs [that say] ‘don’t walk over to me.’”
A recent graduate of the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, Kesselman works under EP Entertainment while writing songs of their own. The two first met almost a year ago, through a music manager connected to one of Kesselman’s former professors. 
“I think the first session we wrote a song that she want[ed] to put out, so it was just great writing chemistry,” Kesselman said. “[The] writing just feels so much easier because it comes from a place of friendship.”
Nadine’s writing not only comes from a place of friendship with her co-writers but also with her audience. 
“I love all my songs, because they’re true to me,” Nadine said. “But I also know that I go through things that other people go through as well. So it’s really important to me that people can relate to my songs and … are able to relate to [them].” 
Her songs ring with a tone of authenticity uncommon in mainstream pop ballads. When asked who would enjoy Nadine’s music, Kesselman replied: “[Anyone] looking for a friend in music.” 
Nadine’s charming personality not only reflects in her professional relationships but also in her public persona.
“I think there’s just something really special about the personality that we see in her music,” Kesselman said. “She’s not just the song. And she’s not just the brand. She gives you both, and that’s what I love about working with her.” 
The two are currently working together on a few songs in Nadine’s upcoming senior project, an extended play. Those who have found themselves down in quarantine can look forward to a song Nadine holds close to her heart, an anthem of “You can do this, no matter what you’re going through,” which she wrote while cooped up in her house as a result of the pandemic. 
Post-graduation, the artist plans to develop her career in L.A. and collaborate with many more artists. 
“Once [the coronavirus] is over, I’m making L.A. my new playground, not just USC anymore … L.A. will be where I can showcase my songs and my voice and my personality,” Nadine said. 
What kind of songs can we expect from Nadine once that happens? Definitely not anything you could easily box into one genre or perspective. Previously labeled a “pop princess,” the singer-songwriter hopes to tack “not your average” onto the front. 
“I feel like sometimes … if you’re labeled as a pop princess, it’s not really in the best light,” Nadine said. “So [I want to change that from] a bad thing [for myself].” 
If there’s anything that characterizes the singer, it’s her power to transform stories and genres into much more than their label.

Phi Gamma Nu, a nationally recognized professional development organization, officially launched its USC chapter this fall. Although it’s still in its early stages of development on campus, PGN seeks to develop a network to abate unemployment and support students on their journey to success. 
Since then, PGN has grown to be an organization that focuses on three pillars of success: philanthropy, social development and professional development. According to Reyes, these qualities catalyze not only a professional network but also a community that supports each other and those in need.
Domenic Reyes, a senior majoring in business administration, initiated the chapter at USC. While interning at an accounting firm during Summer 2019, a peer informed Reyes that PGN at her own university played a pivotal role in her preparation for an internship she acquired and recommended Reyes start a chapter. 
Although there are various professional development organizations on campus, Reyes said that PGN is unique in its focus on community, compounded with professional development. PGN provides its members a support system and companions that Reyes said he hopes will persist beyond the bounds of one’s time as an undergraduate student at USC.
“Expect a very tight knit organization that really focuses on each other and helping each other out in every way possible,” Reyes said. “Being a member is being dedicated to each other, whether that be hearing about a job, whether that be staying up late at night and helping one of your fellow members prep for an interview, whether that be studying late at night.”
In addition, those who join are privy to the alumni and active member network, opening the doors to nationwide opportunities, jobs and connections. Those within PGN also gain access to an online portal, similar to LinkedIn, that provides them easy access to the network and “everyone is a phone call away or an email away,” Reyes said. 
Domenic’s younger brother and the current vice president of membership, Noah Reyes, a junior studying real estate development, discovered PGN through Domenic. 
“Going into it, we knew it wouldn’t be an easy task, but we still had our vision and we knew we could bring something to the table for a lot of USC students,” Noah said. 
Noah expressed that PGN is an organization that values “diversity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit.” Furthermore, during this confusing time in college when students are trying to discover their passions, Noah said PGN can be of great service because members are able to assess whether or not they are interested in a particular industry through actual experience. 
“For this campus and any campus in general, a lot of students have trouble knowing what they’re going to do when they get out of college, and they’re kind of just lost in the real world,” Noah said. “But providing the opportunity for students to meet … and getting a chance to be exposed to many different jobs and opportunities, they get some insight, or a preview, as to whether or not they’re passionate about something.”
Moreover, PGN hopes to develop a community that is inviting to all by welcoming students with varying backgrounds, perspectives, experiences and areas of study, according to Jaymie Pelayo, the chapter’s vice president of external operations. 
“We really want to be more inclusive and have a diverse pool of students,” said Pelayo, a senior studying business administration. 
Pelayo said that most professional organizations have a “specified major target.” PGN, on the other hand, is open to “anyone who is interested in developing their skills.” 
However, promotion and advertising of a new student organization on campus is quite difficult. PGN currently is a Recognized Student Organization of USC but will not be able to become a Marshall Recognized Student Organization until this coming January. Being an MRSO will provide greater publicity and credibility, allowing PGN to further expand on campus. 
These circumstances have forced PGN to independently promote itself and resort purely to online forms of media to broadcast recruitment and events. In addition, planning philanthropic and social events does pose a challenge due to the restrictions imposed on account of the coronavirus. As a group that is centered around in-person philanthropic events and social networking and bonding, PGN has been working to adapt to the best of its ability. Currently, leadership is brainstorming ways to maintain social and philanthropic events. 
Despite the challenges that obviously have arisen for many clubs and organizations in light of the online format, PGN has done its best to persist with virtual recruitment and event planning. The leadership team is developing professional events that will possibly include groups such as JPMorgan and the accounting firm KPMG “that are open to all USC students,” Reyes said. The organization also has aspirations to include resume and interview workshops as well as “speed networking events” next semester, Pelayo said. 
Although still fresh on the USC campus, Domenic expressed his high hopes for the future of PGN at USC. 
“I really want PGN to be the business organization at USC, being recognized as the end all, be all for professional development for students interested in any type of industry,” Domenic said.

As the 2020 election comes to a close, newsrooms and media outlets have begun to analyze the accuracy of voter turnout and pre-election polling. One demographic that was overplayed in the media was the “middle-aged white women:” Many stations, such as NPR, overestimated the role this demographic would play in shaping the outcome of the election to favor now-President-elect Joe Biden. But CNN exit polls show that white women’s support for sitting President Donald Trump increased from 2016 to 2020. On the other hand, one demographic — out of the many — that was overlooked and overwhelmingly crucial was the young adult vote. 
Similar to the unexpected surges of Black, brown and women of color voters, news stations failed to realize how crucial this demographic was going to be in the election until the votes started getting tallied (just look at Georgia’s mobilization thanks to Black activists). This unexpected turnout should be a point of reflection for news stations; in the future, they should not underestimate marginalized voter turnouts. More specifically, when it comes to young adult voters, newsrooms continually reported on the record-breaking turnout in shock — however, this high turnout is something many young people have expected since 2016. 
Many of the young voters today were too young to vote in 2016 yet had to live with the repercussions of a Trump presidency. During these past four years, young people became more involved in politics and grassroots organizing, but this political involvement was not reflected in the 2020 primaries. Low young voter turnout in January caused many journalists to question the reliability of young voters. This doubt only heightened after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race because many young Bernie supporters did not seem to support Joe Biden enough to vote in November. This may have been a factor in why, this time around, newsrooms did not expect high young adult turnout. 
While young organizers such as David Hogg, founder of March For Our Lives, were predicting that the 2020 election would be shaped by young voters, this type of optimism was ignored by news stations. Activist networks made efforts to register young people and held events to encourage civic engagement and voting efforts while, as mentioned earlier, newspapers were hyper-focused on “white middle-aged women.”
Now, exit polls show that not only did young adult voter turnout increase, but it also surged and greatly defined the election. The number of young eligible voters who turned out to vote in this election was at around 50% compared to the 43%  of eligible young voters who turned out in 2016. Young people of color also voted in increased numbers, in support of Biden. 
The fact that newsrooms overlooked these groups speaks to a bigger problem of lack of young perspective in journalistic spaces. Similar to the need for a diverse staff in regards to race, gender and sexuality to ensure accurate reporting on and for these communities, a lack of young perspectives has negatively impacted newsrooms’ reporting on young people. 
Newsrooms report on young activists, young people voting and young people organizing, yet the journalists writing these stories are missing the perspective that comes with being a young person. Although a youth perspective may not be as crucial as people of color in the newsroom, a focus on this angle may have altered the narrative surrounding youth voter turnout in the 2020 election to be more accurate and informative. In the future, newsrooms need to be more cognizant of how neglecting the perspective of young people can cause them to miss youth’s stories until it is too late.

The onset of the coronavirus pandemic has undeniably caused extensive damage to our collective social and public health. In addition to preventing typical in-person contact, the pandemic has challenged the ways in which we take part in and explore our sexual identities. Given these changes, we are met with new opportunities to transform and improve our public conversations around sexual health and sex positivity. 
The United States has long lagged far behind in comprehensive sexual health education. As of Oct. 2020, only 22 states require that sex and or HIV education be medically accurate. Compared to other industrialized nations, like Switzerland, Singapore and the Netherlands, the U.S. leads the world in teen pregnancies, averaging about 57 cases per every 1,000 people ages 15-19. Only nine states require that sexual education be inclusive for LGBTQI individuals, while seven states outright prohibit educators from discussing LGBTQI health and relationships in their sex education programs. 
Despite the growing body of research which indicates that abstinence-stressed education does not reduce the spread of STIs, teen pregnancy or other sexual health related concerns, 39 states including the District of Columbia ensure that abstinence is covered in sexual education programs, while 28 states require that abstinence be stressed. 
Lack of access to adequate education about contraceptives and consent have disparaging effects on women, rendering many unable to exercise control over their bodies and their future. Undue pregnancy, among other consequences of deficient sexual health education, impairs opportunities to achieve gender equality. 
To make matters worse, the lackluster sexual health education system disproportionately affects marginalized communities, reinforcing socioeconomic and racial disparities in health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are higher rates of STIs among non-white ethinic groups. Additionally, research supports that low-income students arewere less likely to receive sexual education in their health curriculums. 
Public health organizations such as the CDC and Planned Parenthood have long called for improvements to the educational system, citing that sexual health topics are essential components of health education for young people. Beyond this, the current sexual health education system relies on outdated conceptions of sex and pleasure that demonize and shame normal and healthy sexual expression. 
Advocates and medical professionals argue not only for improved comprehensive education about contraceptive use and consent but also for a greater emphasis on sex positivity. 
Sex positive ideology is centered around the reality that sex, if practiced safely and with consent, is a positive thing. It aims to remove stigmas around sexual health, especially surrounding often taboo topics such as masturbation, pornography and phone sex. 
Given the challenges around close physical contact today, it is all the more necessary that a broader public health coalition adopt a sex positive agenda. For those living alone or opting to reduce close contact with others, the safest solution for sexual activity is solo or remote sex. 
In addition to removing concerns about coronavirus transmission, solo sex removes the possibility of STIs and unwanted pregnancy. It also promotes a healthy sexual relationship with oneself, allowing a person to feel empowered and comfortable with their own body. 
Many misconceptions and myths have largely stigmatized masturbation, arguing that it is somehow degenerative for personal well-being. Additionally, the stigma around masturbation is particularly pervasive for women’s sexuality, as sexist delusions assert that it is unfeminine and unbecoming.
Contrary to these sex negative mistruths, masturbation is found to have positive effects such as relieved menstrual cramps and muscle tension and improved sleep, according to the National Women’s Health Center. 
Masturbation is also found to relieve stress. With the inability to resort to other methods of stress relief like gathering with our community, masturbation releases mood-improving chemicals like endorphins, oxytocin and dopamine. 
While often perceived as an activity delegated for those not in relationships, masturbation can actually be a beneficial way to determine what a person likes and doesn’t like, only improving a relationship’s sexual life. 
Other methods of remote sex such as sexting, phone or video sex are also valid and beneficial options during the pandemic. With the removal of physical contact, remote sex allows people to explore and actually communicate about their sexual desires. What may often be more difficult to discuss or confront in person — like certain sexual fantasies — may be more easily talked about over the phone or digitally. 
It is ultimately up to the individual to choose whatever sexual activity is best for them. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a disinterest in solo or remote sex — especially for women — may be influenced by an otherwise sex-negative culture in our country that refuses to have frank and mature conversations about a natural aspect of our health. 
Rooted in antiquated religious traditions intended to suppress sexual desires outside of marriage and procreation, our dismal public health guidelines around sexual health, both before and during the pandemic, have negative consequences. These failures to better educate the public on our sexual health reinforce a patriarchal, heteronormative and privileged supremacist order, disparaging many, but especially women, LGBTQI+ and other marginalized people. 
In efforts to reduce undue impositions of contempt, guilt and shame, as well as public health disparities, we ought to utilize the pandemic as an opportunity to transform our social, cultural and political approaches toward sexual health.

At the end of Week 9, we’re just over halfway through the NFL season. The Los Angeles Rams have played eight games and have a bye week now. They’re 5-3 with eight games to go and trying to make a playoff push in arguably the toughest division in the NFL.  
The Seattle Seahawks lead the NFC West at 6-2 and appear to be the team to beat in the division. The Arizona Cardinals, who also look like a legitimate playoff contender, stand just ahead of the Rams. Although the Cardinals are also 5-3, their record against divisional opponents is better than the Rams’, giving Arizona the tiebreaker. L.A. will play both of these teams twice the rest of the season and need to be sharp in those matchups to either win the division or clinch one of the three Wild Card spots. 
The San Francisco 49ers looked strong to open the season but have been derailed by injuries. Missing some of their key players on both sides of the ball, including quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, tight end George Kittle and defensive end Nick Bosa, it seems unlikely they will be able to compete going forward in this tough division. 
If the playoffs started today, the NFC division winners would be the New Orleans Saints, the Green Bay Packers, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Seahawks. L.A. would be a Wild Card team, along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Cardinals. Teams on the fringes of the playoffs include the 49ers and the Chicago Bears, who the Rams beat in Week 7. 
So the Rams have a good chance of making the playoffs, but their schedule going forward looks tough. Let’s take a look at some of those matchups. 
L.A. will play Seattle at home on Sunday. The Seahawks seemed like the best team in the NFC for the first few weeks of the season, starting off 5-0. However, they’ve lost two of their last three games. The Rams are playing at home and coming off a bye week, so they have a couple advantages in this upcoming matchup. It’s unclear whether Seattle running backs Carlos Hyde and Chris Carson will be available on Sunday, both dealing with lingering injuries. With extra time for the Rams to prepare, Week 10 is a great opportunity to take a game from their divisional rival.  
The following week, L.A. will face Tampa Bay — another tough team expected to contend in the playoffs, currently holding onto the top Wild Card spot. The Buccaneers offense is as talented as any in the league, and their defense is strong across the board, allowing the fewest rushing yards per game in the NFL and forcing the most turnovers. 
After traveling to Tampa Bay, the Rams’ most important games include Seattle again and Arizona twice. The Rams have a few breaks in their schedule against depleted teams like the 49ers, the New England Patriots and the New York Jets. These are all must-win games for a team competing for the playoffs. 
L.A. likely needs to win one of its two matchups against Arizona, a team that quickly bounced back from the bottom of the league this year and became a tough matchup for even the top teams, like Seattle, who Arizona knocked off in an overtime thriller in Week 6.
If the Rams win the games they’re supposed to win (San Francisco, New England, New York) and manage to split their season series against their division rivals in Seattle and Arizona, that would be 10 wins, almost always good enough for a playoff berth. 
This team has looked promising at times this season, but it’s also looked inconsistent. Quarterback Jared Goff was great against a suffocating Chicago defense in Week 7 but turned the ball over four times against an inferior Miami Dolphins team in a blowout loss in Week 8. 
The good news is that the L.A. defense has been very strong to this point in the season, allowing the second fewest yards and points per game in the NFL. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald is a terror for opposing offensive lines and can help contain explosive quarterbacks like Seattle’s Russell Wilson and Arizona’s Kyler Murray. 
The offense hasn’t been bad either, although it hasn’t been too special. The Rams balance their rushing and passing games well and aren’t too reliant on any individual players. When Week 7 Jared Goff shows up, this team is capable of competing with any of the league’s top teams. Remember, the Rams were in the Super Bowl just two seasons ago. 
Overall, the Rams certainly are a playoff contender, and I would expect to see them playing in January, but I wouldn’t count on them winning the division over Seattle. But along with the Cardinals, the Rams can well attain one of those Wild Card spots in the second half of the season.
