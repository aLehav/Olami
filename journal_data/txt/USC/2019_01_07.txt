Last month, the USC Board of Trustees voted in support of Interim President Wanda Austin’s termination of Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis, prompting several University alumni and the USC Marshall Board of Leaders to pen strongly-worded letters criticizing Austin’s decision. These pieces are the latest additions to an outpouring of public disapproval from hundreds of Marshall community members since Ellis announced his removal in December. In their rush to defend Ellis, however, his supporters risked overlooking a key issue: whether or not his actions perpetuated a culture of exclusion at the Marshall school.
The vast majority of the letters and editorials published on the “I Stand With Dean Ellis” website focus on Austin’s lack of transparency and the strength of Ellis’ character. These are reasonable emphases, as justifying the removal of a high-ranking University official requires indisputable evidence of wrongdoing. Their consideration of Ellis’ contributions to diversity and inclusion at Marshall, however, remains surface-level, with only a handful of letters even mentioning them. Within these few, concrete evidence for Ellis’ work centered on  diversity and inclusion efforts were lacking. 
This omission of discernible evidence fails to address the official rationale behind Ellis’ removal, which is based on his character flaws but on his alleged mismanagement of complaints to the Office of Equity and Diversity. While transparency remains an important issue, Ellis’ supporters ought to remember that the purpose of University administration engaging in open communication is to reveal the extent to which Ellis’ actions promoted racial and gender equality at Marshall. 
Given that the administration’s ostensible motive behind firing Ellis was advancing equity, Ellis’ supporters should examine how -— and if — his leadership fostered a culture of inclusivity at Marshall. In the long run, Ellis’ removal could potentially negatively impact minority students. Therefore, appraising Ellis’ contributions to Marshall’s diversity must be the administration’s first priority.
The few responses that argue Ellis was the solution to Marshall’s equity problem generally resort to listing diversity statistics, such as the Marshall student body’s relatively high representation of minorities, the incoming MBA class’ achievement of gender parity and the majority-women composition of Ellis’ board. They often cite the Bloomberg Businessweek report, which ranks Marshall as the 13th best business school in the U.S. in 2018, which found that a strong majority of women, racial minorities and other underrepresented groups rated the climate at Marshall as “extremely positive.”
While facts and figures serve as valuable tools to gauge an institution’s ability to serve its students’ needs, they are by no means an all-encompassing representation of student experiences. Vague rankings such as “extremely positive” are inherently incapable of conveying the everyday slights and insults that a minority student may face. The Daily Trojan previously reported that alumnus Joshua Ogundu studied under professors who “made ‘racially charged’ jokes.” It is reasonable to assume that many more stories of institutional hostility toward minorities potentially remain untold.
Ogundu’s experiences may not be representative of those of all students, but they do indicate a pattern of unacceptable conduct that Ellis had the responsibility to investigate and resolve. Marshall’s enrollment of minorities does not necessarily entail that these students feel included in campus culture, and Ellis’ supporters have the burden of proving that Ellis achieved not only diversity enrollment, but inclusion as well.
In addition, these defensive responses place diversity statistics next to national rankings instead of examining their implications on student life, framing them as simply another item on the University’s laundry list of achievements. This treatment ultimately prioritizes institutional prestige over the inclusion of marginalized students, an incredibly warped and hardly winsome framework to use in criticizing  Austin’s initiative.
As long as Ellis’ defenders continue to content themselves with surface-level examinations of Marshall’s approach to diversity and inclusion, they not only lose an opportunity to persuade Austin but also contribute to a campus discourse neglectful of the comprehensive needs of racial and gender minorities. The Marshall community must stop hiding behind statistics and start listening to the members it has systematically excluded. As long as everyone works toward building a culture of inclusion, the Trojan Family can move beyond scandals like Ellis’ downfall.

If any students or faculty walked through the southeast corner of University Park on Dec. 17, they might have heard gunfire or seen police with replica weapons. This was not an emergency situation, it was an annual DPS drill that occurs after Fall semester during winter break. However, because the drill took place over winter break, very few students were able to benefit from it. USC Department of Public Safety’s active shooting drill in conjunction with the Los Angeles Police and Fire departments failed to include the student body, faculty and staff due to bad timing.
By choosing to run the drill when most were away for break and telling those on campus to avoid the area where the drill was happening, DPS disconnected the drill  from the community it was meant to protect. The participating officers have diminished awareness of what their roles would be if a real-life crisis arose at USC. While creating distance can benefit the mental health of students and faculty at USC, it fails to address the necessity of training them as well.
Increased preparedness unfortunately comes at a time when mass shootings are fairly common occurrences. By November 2018, the Gun Violence Archive reported there were 307 mass shootings across America last year, including the Thousand Oaks bar shooting that took place about an hour north of USC’s campus.
More universities are partnering with local law enforcement and other agencies to carry out active-shooter preparedness drills similar to the one DPS conducted over break. The National Fire Protection Agency released the NFPA 3000: Standard for an Active Shooter/Hostile Event Response Program, which has been implemented at universities like Virginia Tech, Harvard and Missouri State. Missouri State also conducted its own active shooter drill over the summer to involve fire safety and hospitals for the first time. 
Involving more law enforcement entities beyond campus security can more comprehensively prepare the University for a shooting. It can also give USC students greater peace of mind knowing that multiple security forces are involved in protecting them from a shooting.
USC had an active shooter scare in October 2017, shortly after the Route 91 Harvest Festival mass shooting in Las Vegas. Many students remember the confusion that spread as conflicting information about the situation and proper protocol circulated. While the incident turned out to be false, students and faculty would have been at risk if there were an actual shooter on campus.
If a shooting were to take place, those on campus are in danger of not knowing how to keep themselves safe or making decisions that could place them in harm’s way. There is a page on the DPS safety website offering a multi-step plan and a video aimed to show those on campus what to do but it is insufficient. Beyond this page, there isn’t very much emergency training offered to students.
USC can provide such training to students as part of freshman orientation. The NFPA said that there are some universities that are including active shooter training as part of their orientation to offset these concerns. However, offering a one-size-fits-all training can come with drawbacks. 
A Loyola University study found that while active shooter drills do make students feel more prepared, they also increase fears about becoming a potential victim. This can create anxiety in a place intended for learning if not handled with care. In the future, partnering with mental health services to come up with solutions to increase awareness can help students overcome anxiety and still get training.
If USC wants to ensure everyone on campus is protected, it must create programs to increase preparedness to all its faculty and students as well. Making sure DPS understands what to do in case of a shooting is an important first step. By extending training for students, faculty and staff, DPS needs to take into account how sensitive this issue can be, and provide those on campus with greater awareness without increasing stress or worry. 
In the future, DPS should involve students and faculty in drill exercises in a way that gives them greater assurance should a crisis ever arise.

Rachel Li / Daily Trojan
California Gov. Gavin Newsom took the reigns Monday to head America’s most populous state — to start his tenure, he has some radical changes he hopes to integrate into California’s education system. While many of them lack specificity, may be overly ambitious and are expensive, they are all well-intentioned. Newsom’s “cradle to career” idea, otherwise dubbed the “California Promise,” is one such plan. 
Designed under the pretense that most families cannot comfortably afford college tuition, Newsom’s plan is to expand prenatal care, introduce universal preschool for 4-year-olds, start college savings accounts for every California kindergartener and guarantee two years of free community college tuition. 
Despite each component of the plan costing tremendous amounts of money ($2 billion for universal preschool, $92 million per year for community college tuition, according to EdSource), these costs could very well be investments that will ultimately save money for the average California taxpayer. Irrespective of the plan’s quality or its costs, however, Newsom’s plan does not address the root of the problem: College tuition, particularly in the  public University of California system, is inordinately high. While private universities come with even higher costs, Newsom’s actions affect public schools and taxpayers more directly.
But Newsom’s reasoning ignores some easy fixes that would cut costs. A reason higher education costs so much may be that professors are unwilling to teach more classes.
“I talk to administrators in the UC system who tell me that professors get paid nice salaries, but they don’t want to teach undergrad,” Newsom’s gubernatorial opponent John Cox said in an interview with EdSource. “Well I’m sorry, but that’s one of the reasons why education costs what it costs these days.” 
Most studies are conducted by college professors and teams of academics, but surprisingly (or not so surprisingly), one area that lacks sufficient data is just how long professors work and how much professors’ work directly impacts students. The short answer is not enough. 
According to The Washington Post, the few reports gathered on teaching load suggest that professors on average teach between 12 and 15 hours per week — in other words, three hours of class instruction a day. This is ridiculously low, even without the fact that many professors have no instructional hours over the summer. 
Professor salaries mirror those of most upper middle class Americans working 40 hours for 50 weeks of the year. This figure does not consider professors’ month-long winter break or weeks off in the springs and summers free of instructional hours.
According to the University of California, 30 percent of their budget goes toward academic salaries. An additional 14 percent goes toward professor retirement benefits. Only a fraction of these salaries and benefits — stemming from student tuition — comes back to directly impact students. 
“The Best Schools” Magazine database, which analyzes and ranks the highest-paid professors in the country, features one from UC Berkeley. One of two public school professors in the top 10 makes a whopping $709,000 a year. His salary is funded in part by students who take out loans they will spend the rest of their lives paying off.
Many professors dedicate their lives to important research that, in a many cases, can save lives. Research is funded not just by student tuition, but to a larger extent by grants. However, it is difficult to persuade a family over $100,000 in student debt that their student’s education is being managed appropriately with the ratio of research hours to instructional hours. 
There is not much the government can do regarding the cost of private colleges and universities. After all, enrolling in one is a choice that is dependent on accepting the price tag of the university, there are no government subsidies for these institutions. 
But everyone who files taxes in California partially funds the state’s public universities. If all California residents are pitching in to ensure families of all socioeconomic backgrounds have strong academic institutions for their children to attend, those institutions should not be wasting our money. It’s a lose-lose for everyone —  for California residents who supposedly subsidise the costs of college tuition and for the families who depend on the state for affordable higher education. 
So while Newsom’s plan to alleviate the cost of college is well-intentioned, it glosses over the cost itself. Instead of assuming the cost is justified, perhaps Newsom should look into why the cost of college is so high in the schools under his control. While this may not be the magical solution, he should at least start by looking at how many professors work “full time” and just how justified their compensation is in relation to the time they put in.
