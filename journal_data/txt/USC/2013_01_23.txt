The following incidents were reported in the Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Saturday, Jan. 16, and Tuesday, Jan. 19. 
Crimes against property
At 12:14 a.m.  on Jan. 19, a student   broke a glass door when he inadvertently threw a bottle into a home at 1117 28th St. while engaged in horseplay. There were no injuries and the student agreed to pay for the damage.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 4:43 p.m. on Jan. 19, DPS officers responded to a student and a non-USC male who both sustained cuts when they bumped heads while playing basketball.
at 12:11 a.m. on Jan. 19, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student who passed out on the lawn in front of 2712 Menlo Ave. The student was conscious and coherent when contacted by the officers, but an LAFD RA unit was requested as a precaution. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, who was released at the scene.
at 10:40 P.m. on Jan. 18, DPS officers contacted a staff member who had been observed sleeping overnight in his vehicle on campus on multiple occasions and advised him that it was a violation of transportation services rules.
at 12:45 P.m. on Jan. 16, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect riding a bicycle aimlessly around campus near entrance Gate 1 and detained him for investigation. The officers determined that the bike was registered to a student and, when they contacted the student, he said that it had been stolen a month ago but he did not file a report. During questioning, the suspect claimed to have purchased the bike from a bike shop, but he did not have any proof of ownership and the bike was subsequently confiscated by the officers. The suspect was then released.
at 11:51 A.m. on Jan. 16, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a cut to his head when he walked into a wall on the roof of Parking Structure A. A LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #810 responded. The RA Unit examined the student and released him.
at 9:30 A.m. on Jan. 16, a suspect removed a bicycle secured to a bike rack and removed the front wheel from a second bike secured to the same rack near the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism.
 
Correction
“Senate votes on honors” (Jan. 23) did not clearly represent the effect of an Undergraduate Student Government resolution. Resolutions represent the opinion of the student government but are not university policy.
The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
“Horseplay”?  I don’t think that is proper term for the DT.   I watched a program on HBO’s Real Sex about “Horseplay” and it didn’t have anything to do with throwing bottles…

As the celebratory hype surrounding the president’s second inauguration gradually quieted down, a panel of experts — two former state legislators and two politically active students — gathered Wednesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum to speculate how President Barack Obama will address major policy issues in his final term.
Moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Rachel Bracker, managing editor of the Daily Trojan, the panel considered some of the key issues that proved decisive in the November election.
USC College Republicans member Greg Sefain and USC College Democrats member Ethan “E.J.” Levin provided insights from a student perspective. Former California State Senator Tony Strickland and former California State Assemblyman Anthony Portantino pulled from their own experiences in politics when addressing the president’s second term.
Talk of job creation took a back seat as gun control and environmental issues  dominated the conversation, with all panelists noting that the president might be more willing to assume progressive positions on these hot-button issues now that he no longer faces reelection.
“I think that Obama’s goal is to transform the powers of the presidency,” Strickland said. “Many of the issues that will be central to this administration are issues that Obama rarely even touched on in his first term.”
Sefain noted how the immediacy and relevance of gun control legislation will likely take a prime spot on the presidential to-do list, a rather unexpected priority considering how little attention the issue received in previous elections.
“Obama must be mindful of his game plan,” Sefain said. “He will likely capitalize early on the gun argument because he knows that right now it is in the minds of all Americans.”
Levin remained optimistic that the beginning of a second term might encourage bipartisan negotiations.
“I think a lot of Democrats wanted to see more from Obama in his first term,” Levin said. “If he can harness discontent for current gun laws, he may be able to get Congress on the side of progressive legislation.”
Strickland did not seem as confident in the president’s ability to overcome the hyper-partisan divide that plagues Washington. Rather, he anticipates that the president will exercise strong executive powers in his second term, bypassing Congress entirely when it comes to some of the most contentious issues.
“I think Obama knows that certain agenda items are not going to get through Congress,” Strickland said. “He will probably resort to executive orders in tackling the gun problem. With regards to climate change, I think he will expand the powers of the EPA.”
Strickland’s thoughts were echoed by Portantino, who agreed that the president would likely run into opposition on certain contested issues.
“I’m not sure that Obama will be able to find common ground for issues like gun control and gay rights,” Portantino said.
Panelists, however, also remained wary of the political implications of executive action on some of the nation’s most divisive topics. Some panelists believed that, though the president no longer faces the pressures of re-election, policies that are perceived as too liberal might make for an uphill battle for Democratic presidential contenders in 2016 and might lead to a sweeping Republican victory in the midterm, as was largely the case in 2010.
“In two years, we will face another election, and if the president burns too many bridges in an effort to implement his policies, he could see a major defeat for his party in Congress,” Sefain said.
The panelists also addressed the future of the Republican Party in national politics. Though many commentators have written off 2012 as the beginning of the end for the GOP, panelists remained confident that the party could see a rebound depending on the president’s performance over the next four years.
“Pendulums swing,” Strickland said. “And they always swing.”
The topics discussed in the panel discussion might foreshadow what Obama discuss in his State of the Union Address. The president will deliver this address before Congress on Tuesday, Feb. 12. A viewing of the speech will be held in the lobby of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, followed by a panel discussion.

The Lot, which served as a temporary food court while the campus center was renovated from 2008-10, will be turned into a parking lot by the end of the semester.
In the past five years, The Lot space has been used for different purposes, such as storage for the DormBikes company and, more recently, a temporary location for the JEP house.
Losing the lot · Construction is to be completed by 2014. Since 2008, it has been used as a temporary facility for many organizations. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The site will be converted partially into a parking area; the remaining space will be transformed into a landscape with paved walkways, said associate Senior Vice President for Campus Development and Facilities Management Joe Back.
“We were asked by administration to take [The Lot] down by winter break,” Back said.
The new parking area will replace the former campus bookstore’s parking lot, which  was demolished in preparation for construction of the new Wallis Annenberg Hall The new Annenberg building will be completed in 2014.
“In the meantime, the university had a very real need to provide some parking to replace what was lost for the Wallis Annenberg Hall construction,” Back said. “There was also a strong desire to create a more open area, with nice landscaping and paving.”
On the University Park Campus Master Plan, however, the space is identified as the site for a future building, which Back said is a likely long-term possibility.
“As far as the Master Plan goes at some point, it will be a building and won’t be a parking [lot] forever,” Back said.
Students had varying opinions about building the new structure and walkway in place of The Lot.
Lillian But, a junior majoring in psychology and neuroscience, said the building of more walkways is a much-needed addition to the area.
“I like the idea that [the construction] is making a broader walkway for students,” But said. “Since the imaging building right below SGM has opened, more students are going in and out of that area and it’s harder for pedestrians and bikers to move during school hours.”
Some students express nostaglia toward the changes being made.
“It was nice hanging out there when we were sick of the dining halls,” said Christian Sanchez, a senior majoring in chemical engineering. “It was kind of an odd structure but also a good place to just get out of the sun and relax.”
Alex Chin, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, thinks that the space offers multiple possibilities for potential.
“I see the benefits of it becoming a parking lot and a walkway on campus,” Chin said. “I also could see it as another building part of Dornsife.”
Mary Stepanyan, a senior majoring in human development and aging, thinks the construction plans of the lot will add necessary additional space for students on campus.
“Since I commute, I know how important finding a good parking space is,” Stepanyan said. “Making a part of ‘the Lot’ into a parking structure will be a great addition for students and faculty alike.”
The new parking lot and walkways are scheduled to be completed by the end of the spring semester.

The USC Schwarzenegger Institute unveiled Wednesday evening a new program called the “Be the Change” to recognize USC students working for change on campus. The award will be given to students each month.
Students can submit nominations online for peers who they believe are inspiring leaders. Winners receive a $250 gift certificate to the USC Bookstore, a certificate of recognition and VIP seating to the “Be the Change” Supper Speaker Series. Nominators are also awarded with Supper Speaker Series tickets.
The announcement was made at a Council of Presidents dinner in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, with about 70 student leaders attendence.
The Council of Presidents, which is hosted annually by the Undergraduate Student Government, informed student leaders about the new award and  gave an attendees the opportunity to network.
The Undergraduate Student Government Director of Communications Kelly Hann helped organize the event, to which much of her department’s budget goes. Fittingly, Hann considers it one of their most important events.
The student organization presidents were contacted using lists from Student Affairs and USG Campus Affairs.
“So there’s Greek presidents and there’s philanthropy presidents, and there’s ethnicity or minority group presidents,” Hann said.
There were approximately 200 event attendees. A few of the groups represented were the Helenes, the co-ed fraternity for leaders Delta Omicron Zeta, the hip-hop dance team Chaotic 3 and the USC Pakistani Students Association.
Leaders were also able to interact and network with each other, and USG strategically placed students at tables with organizations with which they might be able to work in the future.
“I think it’s a great way to get different student organizations working together, mingling, maybe we can talk about different problems that we’re having,” said Helenes President Chelsey Christensen.
The event also hosted speakers from the USC Schwarzenegger Institute. Bonnie Reiss, the global director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, spoke to students about the new award.
“This award recognizes that many USC students, like many of you here tonight, [who] are already committed to civic engagement,” Reiss said. “The [Be the Change] Spotlight Award is an opportunity for people at USC to nominate a USC student who is an inspiring example of the power one person can have to make a difference.”
USC Alumni Association President Mitchell Lew gave the keynote speech of the night. Lew, who met his wife in Doheny Memorial Library while attending USC, emphasized how much USC has influenced his life, and is now part of students’ destinies.
“You had choices. You had choices and you could’ve gone somewhere else, but you’re here at USC. It is your destiny to be at USC … and especially to be part of the Trojan Family,” Lew said.
Lew also stressed the university’s role as a source of leaders and gave advice to the leaders in the room.
“You want to be leader and you want to do leader,” Lew said. “You represent an organization, but to do leader is to do the things that true leaders do, and that’s being special, building and raising the profile of your organization, motivating and inspiring other students.”

President C. L. Max Nikias and the athletic department announced the Hall of Champions in the new Heritage Hall will be renamed the Pat C. Haden Hall of Champions after athletic director Pat Haden to honor his 60th birthday.
The athletic department received $4 million in donations from Haden’s close friends, colleagues and university trustees. Toward the end of the fall 2012 semester, the administration and athletic department made plans to rename the Hall of Champions, which houses the university’s trophies, including the Heisman trophies.
Winning tradition · The Hall of Champions in Heritage Hall will be named after Pat Haden. Renovation on the hall began last year. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
The renaming of the Hall of Champions was unveiled at a private celebration hosted at Nikias’ house earlier this month.
Among the donors was CEO of Guthy-Renker and UCLA alumnus Ben Vandebunt, making it the largest gift to USC from a former UCLA student-body president.
Many tributes to other legendary USC athletic figures stand in Heritage Hall, such as busts to honor former athletic coaches Willis O. Hunter and Jess Hill.
In a similar vein, the fundraisers noted that Haden is a valuable and integral part of the university’s sports tradition.
“A prominent place in the building that honors the greatest achievements in Trojan history will carry the name of one of the greatest Trojans of all time,” Nikias said in a statement on the athletic department’s website. “Your legacy as a student-athlete, as an academic leader and as a person will forever be connected to the storied legacy of USC.”
The renovation of the Hall of Champions is part of the larger athletic department’s $300 million Heritage Initiative. The Heritage Initiative is an effort to modernize the athletic facilities, with a particular focus on re-designing the public showcase of the university’s athletic accomplishments in the 40-year-old Heritage Hall building.
The renovation, which is scheduled for completion by late 2013, costs $35 million; The fundraising campaign began in August 2012. More than half of the anticipated monetary goal has been raised, said sports information director of the athletic department Tim Tessalone.
Groundbreaking for the new Heritage Hall began in December 2012. Other projects include the construction of the Merle Norman Stadium for sand volleyball and renovation of the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Really?  That’s so tacky to name something after someone living, let alone after a current employee!!
Are they serious. Haden never won a Heisman Trophy. Taking money from a ‘ruin is sacrilegious in my mind.
Money says it all at USC . This might have been the case if Haden had not taken the AD job. He has been a
real disappointment so far in his duties. Football, basketball , baseball, and track & field where he has refused
to accept some top foreign athletes on academic issues.

USC sophomore Sabrina Santamaria was honored as the Pac-12 women’s tennis player of the week Tuesday after a strong performance in the Freeman Memorial Womens’ Tennis Championships. Utah’s Slim Hamza was awarded the Pac-12 men’s tennis player of the week.
Santamaria took first place in both the singles and doubles tournaments in the annual Las Vegas event, taking the latter title with junior Kaitlyn Christian. The duo, currently ranked No. 1 in the country, defeated three different schools en route to their victory. They knocked out the University of North Carolina in the final round.
In the singles side of the bracket, Santamaria easily trounced her earlier opponents before again facing a Tar Heels opponent in the finals, this time taking on UNC’s Gina Suarez-Malaguti in the championship match. She handily defeated Suarez-Malaguti as well, winning 6-0, 6-1.
Santamaria is ranked No. 17 nationally in singles and finished with a 9-3 record in the fall. She has won two consecutive  ITA National Indoor Doubles championships alongside her partner Christian.
The weekly award was just the latest achievement for the talented sophomore, who was named an ITA All-American and an All-Pac-12 second-team selection last season.
In only her second season at USC, Santamaria has already compiled an impressive number of accolades. As a freshman last year, she paired with Christian to win the ITA National Indoor Doubles championship, as well as the Pac-12 doubles championship. Santamaria also earned a spot on last season’s All-Pac-12 second team and was named to the ITA Collegiate all-star team.
So far, his season has featured much of the same success for the Los Angeles native. She was also named USC student-athlete of the week for her performance at the Freeman Memorial tournament, taking home the honor alongside men’s swimming and diving junior Vladimir Morozov.
The Women of Troy start off their dual match season at home on Jan. 26 against the Akron Zips. USC will serve as the host school for this year’s  ITA Kick-Off Weekend, with Tulane, UC Irvine and Akron all playing at Marks Stadium. USC’s opening match against the Zips is scheduled to start at noon, while Tulane and UCI will square off at 9 a.m. in the tournament’s opening match.

With national signing day fast approaching, USC coach Lane Kiffin crossed off the most glaring issue of the offseason this past week when he officially named Clancy Pendergast his new defensive coordinator.
Prior to a report on Pendergast’s impending hiring, little had been reported regarding possible candidates or coaches that had interviewed with Kiffin for the position. Upon first hearing of the decision to hire Pendergast, my first thought was simple: Who is Clancy Pendergast?
Some quick research began to paint the picture. First off, Pendergast is an experienced defensive coach at both the college and professional level. The 45-year-old also has roots in the Pac-12, as he served as the defensive coordinator for Cal the past three seasons and was also a graduate assistant at USC in 1992, just two years after he earned his undergraduate degree from Arizona. Other college stops include a year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State and two seasons as an assistant at Oklahoma.
His NFL resume is even more extensive. Pendergast’s first job in the NFL came with the Houston Oilers in 1995, when he served as a defensive assistant and worked primarily with linebackers. He stayed only one season in Houston before going to the Dallas Cowboys to coach their secondary.
After seven seasons in Dallas, he had a yearlong stint with the Cleveland Browns as a linebackers coach before landing his first coordinating job with the Arizona Cardinals. His five-year stay in Glendale was highlighted by the team’s appearance in Super Bowl XLIII, where the Cardinals narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23. Despite the team’s success, Pendergast was fired less than a week after the game by first-year head coach Ken Whisenhunt.
Pendergast stayed in the NFL for one more season, this time with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was the defensive coordinator for only one season before being replaced by Romeo Crennel. After the 2009 season, he was hired by Cal where he stayed for three seasons, his last coming in 2012.
At Cal, Pendergast’s defense led the Pac-12 in total defense in 2010 and 2011 but plummeted to No. 10 last season. The Golden Bears’ scoring defense had a similar trend, finishing third, fourth and ninth, respectively, in Pendergast’s first, second and third seasons.
I’ll admit the trend is troubling. That Cal’s defense got progressively worse, at least statistically, in each year under Pendergast’s watch is certainly not a good thing. But many of the positive things being said about Pendergast revolve around one game rather than any particular season: Cal’s 2010 game against Oregon, where the Ducks squeaked out a 15-13 win at Berkeley. Oregon led the nation in scoring that season en route to a 12-1 record and an appearance in the BCS national championship game.
I remember that season vividly: Nobody came close to slowing Oregon down that year. The Ducks were in then-Oregon coach Chip Kelly’s second season, and his revolutionary offensive approach was finally taking the nation by storm. Oregon’s offense averaged 530.7 yards per game that season and heading into the game against Cal, it had averaged nearly 55 points per contest through the season’s first nine games.
Cal, though, had no interest in hosting the Ducks for a track meet that night. The Golden Bears’ defense held LaMichael James and company to a mere 317 total yards and a miniscule 2.9 yards per carry. The team that managed to score 73 offensive touchdowns for the season was only able to record one in this game, as the Ducks returned a punt for a touchdown in the game’s first half.
Pendergast’s aggressive style and propensity to blitz and utilize man-to-man coverage has been credited in this much-lauded performance, something that former defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin was less apt to utilize (Kiffin’s schemes relied more on zone defense).
If I haven’t done a good job at selling Pendergast as a good hire, I’m not surprised. One of the things Lane Kiffin mentioned in his announcement was Pendergast’s familiarity with Pac-12 offenses; the numbers, however, demonstrate that the more familiar Pendergast became with the Pac-12, the more success opposing offenses had scoring points on the Bears’ defense. So how can this be evaluated as a smart hire?
Call it a gut feeling, but I feel that one performance against Oregon carries some significant weight. Oregon doesn’t have problems scoring against anybody, and never in the Chip Kelly era did they have as much trouble in one game as they did on that night. Even with Kelly gone, Oregon’s offense is still the class of the Pac-12, though Rose Bowl champion Stanford might have something to say about that. Regardless, Kiffin knows that if the Trojans are to contend in the Pac-12 (which, regardless of last season’s struggles, will be the expectations of USC fans everywhere), they need to be able to contain high-powered offenses like Oregon’s. And even if it was just that one performance, Pendergast gives USC that chance.
Early reviews have been positive in one key area: among recruits. Current USC commits, such as cornerback Chris Hawkins and linebacker Michael Hutchings, expressed their enthusiasm upon hearing of Pendergast’s hire. Other USC recruits have familiarity with Pendergast, who courted many of them while at Cal.
Given the previously mentioned defections of several USC targets, Pendergast serving as a stabilizing force among this class is definitely reassuring. The on-field performance of the USC defense under the helm of its new defensive coordinator will, in time, make a case for or against itself. His hire is a gamble, but it is one that Kiffin knows he has to make.  USC had plenty of issues that led to its abysmal 2012 season, but chief among them was its defense.
Pegging Pendergast as defensive coordinator can be seen as a boom-or-bust move, one that is right in line with Pendergast’s blitz-heavy scheme. Was Cal’s regression last year indicative of its coach or its inexperienced players? The answer might lie somewhere in the middle.  What is clear, however, is that Kiffin saw enough potential in Pendergast to label him as the “perfect fit” to run his defense.  Many may be skeptical of such adulation, especially given Cal’s defensive struggles following their lone mastery of Oregon.  But, as far as this Trojan fan is concerned, one brilliant defensive performance is enough to provide hope that many more can come from a unit that hasn’t experienced any in quite some time.

After winning an unprecedented four consecutive national championships, USC’s men’s tennis team enters the 2012-13 dual -match season this Friday ranked No. 2 in the nation. Based on the team’s success over the past few years, USC was chosen as one of 15 hosts of the ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament.

The tournament features four teams and spans two days. The first match of the weekend features the No. 69 Fresno State Bulldogs against the No. 60 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Then, USC will square off against the No. 66 San Diego State Aztecs. The winner of each of these matches will play for the championship and a berth to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
Last weekend, USC competed at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Thousand Oaks, Calif., against teams from UCLA, Cal, Baylor and Stanford. Sophomore Ray Sarmiento, USC’s highest-ranked singles player at No. 10 in the country, took home the singles title by defeating Adrien Puget of UCLA. Junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Eric Johnson advanced to the doubles championship but were defeated in a close match by sophomores Marcos Giron and Dennis Novikov, a pair from UCLA.
In the quarterfinals of doubles play, sophomore Yannick Hanfmann was forced to retire because of injury, but has since been fully participating in practices. USC coach Peter Smith described Hanfmann as “a little banged up,” but he has confidence in his team.
“If guys are down, you’ve got to depend on the other guys to step up,” Smith said.
SDSU also had success in its first weekend of play, sweeping the UC San Diego Tritons and the UC Riverside Highlanders in its season opener at Aztec Tennis Center. The Aztecs are led by senior Derek Siddiqui and sophomore Thorsten Bertsch, both of whom earned all-conference honors in 2012. Sophomore Andranik Khachatryan is their only ranked player, listed as No. 123 in the country.
In its matchup last season, USC shut out SDSU 7-0 without the help of senior standout Steve Johnson to improve to 34-3 all-time against the Aztecs. At the time, USC held the No. 1 ranking while SDSU ranked No. 60. In the match, USC showcased its younger talent, with impressive wins by Hanfmann, Roberto Quiroz, Eric Johnson, Jordi Vives (who has since transferred) and Jonny Wang, who were all freshmen at the time. Despite the disparity in rankings and the outcome of last year’s match, the Trojans aren’t taking their opponents lightly.
“We won’t approach this match any differently, no matter who we’re playing,” Smith said.
Should USC defeat SDSU, the team would advance to play either Georgia Tech or Fresno State in the championship match. To begin its season, Georgia Tech defeated Old Dominion, 5-2, and Lipscomb, 4-3. The Yellow Jackets boast the No. 3 doubles team in the country, comprising senior Juan Spir and sophomore Vikram Hundal. Fresno State lost its first match to Saint Mary’s 4-3 and split a double-header, losing to Cal Poly 4-1 but defeating UC Riverside 4-0. Fresno State coach Evan Austin is in his first year with the Bulldogs and the team recently added two new players, Nikolas Papic and Felipe Fritz, from Santiago, Chile.
Georgia Tech plays Fresno State on Friday, Jan. 25, at 10 a.m. Then, USC faces SDSU at 1 p.m. The consolation game will be played on Saturday, Jan. 26, at 3 p.m. and the championship match will be held at 6 p.m. All matches will be played at Marks Tennis Stadium.

After a weekend in which the USC men’s basketball team split two hard-fought games that came down to the final seconds, the Trojans hit the road to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils on Thursday night at 7:30 p.m.
Turnover troubles· USC senior point guard Jio Fontan struggled in the team’s recent victory over Oregon State, where he had ten turnovers. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
USC (8-11, 3-3) staved off a tough Oregon State defense in the final minutes to secure a 69-68 victory Saturday, despite allowing the Beavers to overcome a 15-point deficit in the second half. Arizona State (14-4, 3-2) suffered a 17-point loss to its in-state rival, No. 6 Arizona, whom the Trojans will face Saturday.
The win for USC, which comes as the first under interim head coach Bob Cantu, moved the Trojans up to No. 6 in the Pac-12 standings, just one position behind the Sun Devils. With their next three games coming on the road against Pac-12 opponents, USC has the potential to make a serious move this week.
“It’s a huge opportunity for us,” junior center Omar Oraby said. “[The Sun Devils] are a very good team, one of the top teams in our conference. We have nothing to lose so we have to go out and play and get some wins.”
USC leads the all-time series against Arizona State, but the Trojans lost both times the teams met last season. Still, Cantu sees the upcoming game as a new matchup.
“They’re a lot different than they were a year ago,” Cantu said. “They’re playing a lot more man-to-man defense. We’ve got to be able to take care of the basketball whether they’re playing man or zone.”
Cantu was confident about the team’s performance during a practice held Tuesday afternoon, acknowledging the focus he observed in all of his players, especially in light of their adjustment to the coaching changes.
“All the guys were fantastic today,” Cantu said. “They’ve been great since this transition and I’m confident I can play any of these guys at any time.”
Part of Cantu’s confidence comes from the team’s performances in games against Oregon and Oregon State last week, both of which were decided in the final seconds — a loss against Oregon after three missed shots at the buzzer and a winning layup with 4.8 seconds remaining against Oregon State.
Despite the loss against No. 16 Oregon, the fact that the team was able to compete against the nationally ranked Ducks boosted its morale.
“Although we lost, we played down to the wire and [the Ducks] were a top team in the country so we have a lot of confidence going into the road trip,” Oraby said.
USC will face more tough competition from Arizona State and especially from freshman guard Jahii Carson, who is posting statistics that rank him alongside some of the best players in the conference.  Despite the loss against Arizona, the star freshman led the Sun Devils in scoring for the 12th time and posted 22 points, marking his eighth 20-point game.
With one of the most challenging schedules, featuring seven games against teams ranked in the NCAA RPI Top 50, USC has already faced off against a number of tough teams and players. The Trojans have especially shown their offensive power in conference games, ranking fourth in points per game with 69.0 and leading all teams with a 45.8 shooting percentage.
USC will need to maintain that production against a staunch defensive squad from Arizona State, which boasts 133 blocks in 18 games (averaging 7.4 per game), good for fourth in the nation.
Still, Pac-12 play thus far shows that statistics alone won’t predict the outcome of a game, a conclusion that Cantu has stressed to his players regarding their upcoming games this week.
“In conference play, anybody can beat anybody,” Cantu said. “We just have to stay focused and try to compete and play hard.”

Just one month into the new year, America is already using 2013 as a springboard to honor the past.
This year marks the 50th anniversaries of the civil rights movement and the assasination of President John F. Kennedy. President Abraham Lincoln also delivered both the Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg Address 150 years ago. On a somewhat recent note, 2013 even marks the 10th anniversary of the iTunes music store. As the United States takes time to pause and reflect on its past, it’s clear that remembering history is a cause for celebration or, at the very least, polite acknowledgment.
In literature, however, the value of paying homage to historical events is not so clearly defined. Works that use history as a setting, such as Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander series, shoot to the top of the New York Times bestseller lists, but they’re also known more for their entertainment value than for their factual evidence. And on the other end of the spectrum, Paula McClain’s The Paris Wife or Philippa Gregory’s The Other Boleyn Girl take popular historical characters — in this case, Ernest Hemmingway and Anne Boleyn — and bring them back to life with new dialogue and re-imagined events, a device that literally puts words in someone else’s mouth.
With these and similar problems, historical fiction faces something of a conundrum. Literature, as a medium filled with captivating narratives and relatable characters, sets out to entertain and communicate a certain value to the reader. Writers of history books, on the other hand, attempt to inform readers of past events — even if in a sometimes-biased manner. As a form that incorporates elements of both fields, good historical fiction must maintain the delicate balance of entertaining and informing, a difficult feat to accomplish.
But perhaps the genre remains so problematic because of its many approaches to re-evaluating history. Some works simply use history as a setting, a way to freshen up modern sentiments against a familiar but distant backdrop.
Some authors seem more preoccupied with giving a voice to the voiceless, supplementing knowledge of past events with characters previously left out of the historical cannon. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Gregory writes not from the perspective of Anne Boleyn, the famed mistress and love interest of Henry VIII, but from the viewpoint of her lesser-known sister, Mary Boleyn. Through Mary’s eyes, readers get a sense of life in the court (and in the bed) of one of England’s most famous kings, while also hearing a historical narrative they might not have received otherwise.
But isn’t there something unfair about recreating the deceased, about giving them new stories, words and ways of thinking? In The Other Boleyn Girl, readers might get to meet Mary Boleyn, but they also come across a desperate Anne Boleyn and an easily manipulated Henry VIII — historical figures depicted as such through Gregory’s imagination. Similarly, The Paris Wife’s Hemmingway comes off as charismatic, yes, but also is arrogant and oblivious to the pain he causes other characters. In cases such as these, it seems fairly easy for a few stray adjectives to color a reader’s impression of history. Gregory’s The Other Boleyn Girl was also criticized for its historical inaccuracy, giving historical celebrities a new identity seems another prominent cause for concern.
But tainting a historical figure’s legacy is hardly the worst problem of historical fiction. Other authors look back to history as a way of praising a bygone era. In her beloved novel Gone with the Wind, Margaret Mitchell follows the tale of Southern belle Scarlett O’Hara and her determined efforts to maintain the Tara plantation and hold on to the traces of her life destroyed by the Civil War.
“I want the old days back again and they’ll never come back, and I am haunted by the memory of them and of the world falling about my ears,” says Scarlett as she struggles to readjust to life during Reconstruction.
A “great American novel” harboring nostalgia for slavery and the antebellum South? I think I’ll have to pass.
Even with historical fiction’s flaws and challenges, readers still find themselves attracted to retellings of familiar stories. Jennifer Chiaverini’s critically acclaimed Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker hit shelves just last week, and riding in the wake of slavery-themed hits like Django Unchained, titles such as Philida and The House Girl continue to meet rave reviews.
So what, then, is behind our fascination with historical fiction?
Perhaps it’s the chance for a complete do-over of all of our past failings. American ignorance got a chance to take another look at racial discrimination in 2009’s The Help. Even Gregory’s The Other Boleyn Girl gives the historical figure Anne Boleyn a depth and humanity that is overshadowed by her untimely beheading.
Or, more simply, perhaps historical fiction just provides us with an opportunity to connect with characters who, despite separations of time and place, continue to remind us of humanity’s common bonds. Whether previously known or unknown, these characters hide illicit affairs from their parents, whip out killer dance moves in royal courts and weep with agonies of unexpected death and fear of the unknown. As it snatches two-dimensional figures from textbooks and catapults them into re-created worlds, historical fiction fleshes out general notions of the human experience and connects everyday citizens with previously inaccessible queens and slaves.
Maybe, then, historical fiction doesn’t exist to regurgitate information, but to show us that we haven’t changed so much after all.

Such a lot to be said about this interesting article.  But surely the most important thing is that with the right research and the right imaginative tools the best historical fiction can both inform and entertain equally.   Not sure if it tells us we are always the same – since the more research I do into history the more I realise that different religious and political systems create different ways of thinking. But maybe something about feeling is always there underneath. 
Anyway, could I suggest you look out for Blood and Beauty: the Borgias this July. A novel about one of the most infamous – and often misrepresented families . I promise you will be reading accurate history in almost every detail, down to things they actually said to one another as far as know it. AND compelling story telling. I know it is a big claim for a writer to make but I am ready to stand by it. History and fiction can work together to make us smarter about the past as well as excited by the people in it. I have dedicated the last twelve years of my life to trying to make that happen.

Everything comes back in style if enough time passes: Vintage is now chic and Baroque is back.
J.S Bach was sometimes considered “too old fashioned” during his lifetime, but the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra’s five-concert series, “Baroque Conversations,” offers a fresh take on Bach’s music in a uniquely personal setting. And though Bach’s music was often written for formal events, his pieces are just as at home in the Colburn School’s Zipper Concert Hall as it was in Frederick the Great’s palace.
Though the LACO has a history of innovative performances, the Baroque Conversations concert exceeded expectations.  Named after musical philanthropist Richard D. Colburn, the Colburn School pays homage to a great supporter of local arts. Aside from being centrally located in Downtown Los Angeles, the Colburn school has special significance for the orchestra: As a co-founder of the orchestra, Colburn provided the financial backing that helped make LACO possible.  And it’s a good thing he did: The musicians’ stage presence, the intimate setting and the delightful music made the evening enjoyable for classical music buffs and first-timers alike.
Concert host Allan Vogel, in particular, added personality to the evening of baroque music. Vogel has been LACO’s principal oboist since 1974 and is on Thornton School of Music’s faculty.  Despite his impressive list of awards and vast knowledge of baroque music, he kept the tone  of the night casual, even adding in a few musical jokes.
He opened the show by asking how many musicians it takes to play a trio sonata.  Despite what the name implies, Bach’s trio sonatas call for anywhere from one to five musicians.  The “trio” refers to the number of “voices” in the sonata, not the number of players. In LACO’s case, two instruments share the bass line while two others play the solo parts. Demonstrating his flair for the academic, Vogel informed the audience that placing two instruments on the bass line helps the lower “voice” come through clearer and balance with the two soloists. In fact, his continued rapport with the audience added plenty of useful info to the experience; he helped place the music in context, giving historical background as well as musical details.
The concert opened with Bach’s “Trio Sonata in C Major for Oboe and Violin (orig. for Two Violins), BWV 1037.” This piece featured Allan Vogel on oboe and Margaret Batjer on violin, with Armen Ksajikian and Patricia Mabee on the bass line playing cello and harpsichord respectively. The opening sonata has an intriguing history; some scholars credit this sonata to Bach’s student, Johann Gottlieb Goldberg. Yet Vogel refuted this claim, saying, “we musicians know it’s Bach,” citing the sonata’s musical essence as uniquely Bach’s.
The sonata’s four movements alternate between slow and quick tempos, which keeps the piece lively.  After opening the first movement with picturesque melodies and sustained oboe notes, the second movement, Alla breve provides a change of pace.  The second movement includes two themes but also features episodes of pure counterpoint or an absence of the theme altogether.  This jaunty movement transitions into the mellow third movement, Largo.  The first selections ends with an upbeat and rhythmically complex gigue.
Next, the musical quartet reshuffles for Bach’s “Trio Sonata in G major for Two Flutes, BWV 1039.” Rearranged three times by Bach and written in “the innocent key of G major,” this sonata features David Shostac and Sandy Hughes on flute.  Described as “a joyous romp,” the second selection evokes images of sunny afternoons and shade mottled gardens.
Vogel announced a slight program change and the musicians proceeded with Roland Kato’s arrangement of Bach’s “Trio Sonata in C major for Oboe and Viola (orig. Organ Sonata), BWV 529.”  This piece brought violist Roland Kato and bassoonist Kenneth Munday to the stage and also departed from the four-part form, instead including only three movements: two upbeat with a slower one sandwiched in the middle. Though the first and third movement shared the name Allegro, they were distinct entities.  The first Allegro had a day-dreaming quality to it while the second rendition sounded more carefree and cheerful.  In between the bright Allegros, was Largo. This soothing second movement featured rich viola lines and had a luxurious and almost-lullaby-like quality.
LACO finished the evening with a piece originally written for Frederick the Great, “Trio Sonata in C minor for Flute and Violin from The Musical Offering, BWV 1079.” Based around a chromatic theme given by Frederick the Great, this sonata was Bach’s last piece of chamber music. He wove Frederick’s theme into each movement and made a slight departure from his baroque style in the third movement.  This sonata provided a regal and resounding close to the concert.
After the concert, the LACO musicians answered audience members’ questions. As Vogel noted, Bach’s music readily lends itself to adaptation and interpretation and the post-concert talk gave the musicians a chance to share approaches to Bach.  Keeping with the cozy atmosphere of the concert, the musicians also shared their feelings about the sonatas and about baroque music in general.  This chat provided a fitting close to the Baroque Conversations’ Series first concert.

Though plenty of odd movies have hit theaters in the recent past, audience members will be hard-pressed to find more bizarre, unexpected fare than John Dies at the End.
Seeing supernatural · Former USC student Chase Williamson plays Dave, a college dropout who learns about the mysterious powers of “soy sauce,” a street drug that allows people to see supernatural creatures. – Courtesy of Magnet Release
Written and directed by Don Coscarelli, the film, opening Jan. 25 at the Nuart Theatre, is an adaptation of David Wong’s beloved horror novel of the same name. Told in a thoroughly nonlinear fashion, the story roughly follows the misadventures of best friends Dave (USC alumnus Chase Williamson) and John (Rob Mayes), who partake in a mysterious substance called “soy sauce” that gives them the ability to see supernatural creatures and pass into other universes. Naturally, the pair uses these newfound powers to combat evil.
When creating the film, Coscarelli, who spoke at a screening of the film, noted he tended to discard the terror and favor the humor by stripping at least half of the source material, a process he referred “serious surgery.” It’s a different twist from much of his work, as Coscarelli usually finds ways to make his audience scream. Yet overall, the production more resembles a gruesome twist on Dude, Where’s My Car? than a straight horror tale.
Because the book is a tapestry of intricately woven absurdest prose providing equal parts terror and cathartic humor, loyal book fans might be horrified by the characterization. Even so, Coscarelli’s film does have its own merits. It is a genuinely entertaining romp that effectively conveys many of the most absurd plot points of the novel and successfully engages the audience in its tomfoolery.
Perhaps the most intriguing element of the novel and one of the most effectively translated storylines is the framing device, a scene in a diner between Dave and a journalist (Paul Giamatti). Giamatti provides much of his expected humor for the majority of the film, at first acting skeptical of Dave’s account before finally believing his tale. However, a final surprising reveal leads to a shockingly emotional moment on Giamatti’s part that is emblematic of the Oscar-nominated actor of American Splendor and Sideways repute. It is one of the few truly heartfelt moments that provides a glimpse into an intriguing modification on this mind-bending horror comedy genre by using intriguing, pop culture-infused premises to make the viewers feel some raw emotion.
A newcomer, Williamson boasts a highly promising debut, balancing a distinctive style of levity with some of the aforementioned intense emotion. His performance goes a long way toward helping the audience to connect to the oft-bizarre tale in a visceral way. The young performer got the part only weeks after graduating from USC, and it appears he benefitted greatly from the rounds of rejections the film received from every major studio: Coscarelli said that the major production companies did not find the film compelling enough to finance, necessitating the hiring of a relative unknown.
That was when Williamson, who at that point retained (and still does) the bravado of a college student, came on the scene. Williamson was drawn to the story, which he found comparable to Army of Darkness and believed embodied his exact sense of humor. Yet Williamson was one of the few windfalls to come from such a tight budget; the visual effects and production design both suffered for the sake of thrift. Though the purposely cheap look of the film does add something to the overall guerilla feel, a more convincingly rendered Korrok (the film’s central otherworldly villain) and a more intricately dressed group of sets to represent the alternate universe would have been quite welcome.
It is difficult to be too harsh in this particular criticism, as Coscarelli himself confesses that so much of the book was omitted purely because, on their budget, several scenes were unfilmable. He assessed that CGI is “just a tool,” and so he got creative and made with many low-tech effects sequences. One low-tech effect was an admirable alteration involving a monster assembling itself out of freezer meat. Though the effect was achieved using fishing wire, the scene still manages to play in a divinely frightening way.
Despite the generally flawed technical elements, the film provides plenty of raw entertainment, which is in no small part because of the cast. In addition to Williamson, Rob Mayes, playing the titular character John Cheese, is quite endearing. Clancy Brown who provides what  Coscarelli calls a “larger-than-life” take on a strange, rather unhelpful character of Dr. Albert Marconi is, truth be told, just a bit too large. Tai Bennett, a relative unknown, makes an unexpectedly powerful cameo as the Jamaican drug dealer Robert Marley, who first provides Dave and John with “soy sauce.” It’s these turns, for the most part, that make the film worthwhile.
Though this film falls victim to several of the stereotypes of microbudget horror comedy —underwhelming effects, a scarcity of legitimate scares and an overreliance on cheap jokes — it also wisely relies on several very strong actors to bring emotion out of the story. The film is a highly flawed but rewarding experience that should be praised for making some effort to turn the horror genre around, even if it is not entirely successful in its endeavor.

President Barack Obama’s plan takes a step forward in limiting the access of deadly weapons to dangerous citizens.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
The main points of President Barack Obama’s plan mandate universal background checks for gun purchases, a limit on ammunition magazine capacity to a maximum of 10 rounds each and a reinstatement of the national ban on assault weapons. In addition, he has also issued four executive orders to strengthen the information available about people with mental health problems in the background check system.
Obama’s plan has picked up major criticism and controversy. Part of the issue surrounds the re-introduction of the controversial 1994 assault weapons ban, which restricted 18 specific firearms and regulated features such as pistol grips, folding stocks and high-capacity magazines and lasted until 2004.
Opponents of the ban point to its lack of success in mitigating violent crimes by assault weapons. Yet the stats might have been skewed by the fact that gun manufacturers found ways around the ban by making cosmetic changes to their products, thereby producing legal guns that had only slight modifications to the outlawed models. Recognizing the source of this past failure, Obama will seek to eliminate such loopholes for manufacturers.
Meanwhile, those who argue that restricting the right of law-abiding Americans to wield firearms will infringe their ability to defend themselves against criminals don’t realize that the major shootings in the U.S. that recently took place — in Tucson, Ariz., a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. and a community college in Houston, to name a few — were caused by ordinary Americans with unstable minds and lawful access to firearms.
It’s our duty to prevent, if possible, even one more of these people from acquiring a dangerous weapon. Obama’s new plan is one way that we can prevent more of the same disasters from occurring.
And for Americans who still believe that increasing gun restrictions would do nothing more than restrict our freedoms, it’s time to recognize that regulation is how we historically have dealt with major abuses of freedom. Some gun enthusiasts point out that we don’t simply take cars away because of accidents caused by driving drunk or texting. But we did make reasonable regulations on driving to restrict and punish such behavior so that people will be less likely to hurt others while exercising their freedom to drive. We didn’t take cars away, but we did modify what was allowed — Obama’s idea for gun control is of the same nature.
The Second Amendment is an important constitutional right but also one that needs to be regulated, as we’ve made advancements in firearms that the framers of the Constitution could never have imagined. The amendment’s original intent, after all, was to give Americans the right to maintain a militia to fight back against governmental tyranny.
The saying “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” might be prevalent in our society, but if we can keep some of the modified, deadlier guns out of certain dangerous peoples’ hands, isn’t that the best place to start? Many guns are designed to be killing machines, and we’ve seen far too often that this power comes with a responsibility and power that many Americans can’t handle. How many innocent people will have to give up their lives before we agree to give up part of our freedom to prevent recurring attacks?
In the end, if people are the ones killing people, then it’s logical for us to closely examine  — and regulate — the means by which they can do so.
Catherine Brackett is a sophomore majoring in political science. 
 
Gun control severely limits the powers of the American people and takes away our ability to defend ourselves. 
There’s a pattern: the most destructive pieces of legislation in U.S. history have been passed soon after a major tragedy, enabled and accelerated by the nation’s disgusted unease at such terrible acts.
Two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, legislation was enacted which authorized the internment of Japanese-Americans. Following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2011, President George W. Bush signed the PATRIOT Act into law, leading to an unprecedented violation of civil liberties. Now, a little over a month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the American people have a decision to make: Are we willing to hand over more of our freedoms to the government for an act which promises to do little to stem gun violence?
President Barack Obama recently announced his new gun control plan, and though it does make some positive points regarding mental health — an issue that hasn’t been given due attention as of late — and criminal background checks, it also includes and emphasizes actions that would directly infringe upon the Second Amendment. Maybe most crucially, it would reinstate the ban on “assault weapons” put into law under the Clinton administration — a ban that was ineffective in reducing gun violence and basically only affected cosmetic modifications and accessories placed on standard consumer firearms.
Aside from that measure’s ineffectiveness in curbing gun-related deaths, the plan would drastically reduce the ability of American citizens to legally defend their homes and families while simultaneously creating a demand for an assault weapons black market overnight — a demand that will likely be filled. Considering how easily the cartels import drugs into the U.S., it’s not a stretch to believe they would have any trouble adding modified weapons to their sales mix. Additionally, given the fact that 79 percent of firearms used in gun-related crimes were obtained illegally, the plan creates a serious power gap between citizens and criminals, one in which the firepower of violent criminals and drug cartels vastly exceeds that of law-abiding citizens wishing to defend their property.
Perhaps more important of an issue, and one that proponents of the plan are quick to dismiss, are the implications and legality of the act with regard to the Second Amendment. The ability and responsibility of the citizens to physically defend their rights and property is no less relevant now as is their right to free speech, as both were fundamental in founding values of this nation.
Additionally, proponents of Obama’s plan argue that the Second Amendment is contingent upon service in a militia, and therefore does not protect individual gun ownership. The language and intent of the amendment were indeed left open to interpretation until a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008, which determined that the amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a firearm, regardless of service in a militia. The implications of this, as well as a later 2010 decision, in the context of the amendment mean that neither federal nor state governments can infringe on the right of a citizen to possess a firearm. As such, there is little doubt that the president’s plan, should it pass, will draw attention from the Supreme Court.
Besides the legal implications of the plan, the principles of the Founding Fathers would be violated by the proposal. Proponents of gun control might dismiss their principles as irrelevant and outdated, but true wisdom is timeless. Appropriately, Ben Franklin wrote that “those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Thus, this generation is faced with a dilemma, one that might define them: trust the wisdom of the founding fathers, or the government they warned us about?
Michael Windes is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
What are guns? inanimate objects.
Do a free people have a right to own inanimate objects? yes – even dangerous ones (cars kill more often than guns)
Can your property be taken by government? yes, but only after due process of law
Will restricting gun ownership be before or after a trial? if it is before a trial than it is an illegal taking.
Ok, the argument made “The amendment’s original intent, after all, was to give Americans the right to maintain a militia to fight back against governmental tyranny.” is full of crap!  Somebody should really require people to read their history before commenting on it.  The original amendement propsed was:
 “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.” Annals of Congress, House of Representatives, 1st Congress, 1st Session: p. 451.  June 8, 1789
after several House and Senate committee discussions is was shortened to: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”  and was adopted by both houses on  December 15, 1791.
The final wording completely embodied the original amendments intent and it’s purpose was fully understood. The framers of the Bill of Rights ALWAYS Broadened the final wording of each Amendment rather than narrowing it.  PLEASE refrain from making comments about history that you know nothing about.  It should also be noted that the US Supreme Court in in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) and  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 3025 (2010) reached the same conclusion after reading this same Congressional record. They understand the full intent of the founding fathers and the Constitution (that is their job by the way and not yours). They ruled in favor of the rights of individuals to keep and bear arms.  The CASE IS CLOSED except for the people who wish the Nanny State to run their lives.

Gov. Jerry Brown released California’s first spending plan without a projected budget deficit since 2007.
An estimate from November forecasted a $1.9 billion deficit as opposed to the current projection of a $1 billion reserve, according to the Associated Press.
California state expenditures are now less than the state’s overall revenue, which was aided by the estimated $6 billion tax hike that came with the passage of Proposition 30 in November. To help fund public schools, the proposition called for an increase in income taxes in the next seven years for residents earning $250,000 or more.
Though public education is projected to be revamped under Brown’s spending plan, it will have little to no impact on private universities across the state, including USC.
“We get virtually none of our operating money from the state,” said Lawrence O. Picus, a professor in the Rossier School of Education. “Where budgets from the state might affect us is that some of our faculty have research grants from the state or have contracts that provide minor services for the state. It is a very small amount of money and will probably have no effect one way or another.”
Some students weighed in on California’s new budget and its implications for their daily lives. Daniel Mathews, a junior majoring in economics, disagreed with the proposition and spending plan altogether.
“I do not like the idea of higher taxes,” Mathews said. “Our taxes are too high as it is. While I agree that compromise needed to be made and that the budget needed to be balanced, all they did was raise taxes. The budget gets built around higher taxing, so once the raising of taxes ends in seven years, the budget too will fall apart.”
Samuel Park, a third-year juris doctor candidate at the Gould School of Law, applauded the governor’s plan as being a win-win situation.
“If the tax hikes from high-paying citizens in fact helps the public education system in the state as a whole, it will benefit us all,” Park said.
Beginning on July 1, a $97.7 billion general fund for the fiscal year will be used, and a part of this fund will go toward small increases in educational funding for public academic institutions.
Though the budget will give each California State University $250 million in extra funding, the additional funds are still not what the University of California and the California State University system had anticipated and hoped for in terms of receiving fiscal aid, according to Picus. According to the Orange County Register, the California State University systems needs $250 million to close their funding gap for the upcoming school year.
“The public universities in California have really suffered in the last five years,” Picus said. “There have been real reductions and the $250 million more will help restore some of the cuts they made. [Public institutions] are currently asking for more funding from the government. But, how much do they need, what’s the right number and how do we re-think what goes on? I think those are hard questions that they’re looking at right now and trying to answer.”

USC students and professors revealed their design last week for USC’s home entry in the 2013 Solar Decathlon. Since fall 2011, USC students and professors have combined applied architecture, engineering, sustainability and construction skills to build a functional and livable net-zero solar house for the competition
Going green · Qiuyue Chen, a sophomore majoring in communication, stands next to the model of the solar home to be built on the South Lawn of the University Park Campus for the 2013 Solar Decathlon. – Xi Luo | Daily Trojan
The project has members from schools and departments including the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, the Marshall School of Business and the School of Cinematic Arts. The USC team  currently consists of 26 undergraduate and graduate students from the School of Architecture and Viterbi, as well as faculty advisers Alice Kimm and Gary Paige.
The design of the solar home is the product of combined features from a range of design proposals by the students themselves — an ongoing process of change, testing and refinement.
Team member Corey Koczarski, a fourth-year architecture major, said the challenge required a collaborative effort.
“It involves a lot of discussion and team work,” Koczarski said. “Yet, each individual is also assigned to complete his own task.”
The solar house itself, called the fluxHome, is an energy-efficient alternative to the typical single-family suburban tract house, Koczarski said. It is designed for the middle-class lifestyle and the mild climate of Southern California, reflecting two common models: the courtyard house and the craftsman bungalow.
The fluxHome will be constructed from sustainable, recycled and repurposed materials that are ideal in terms of quality, affordability and environmental use. The solar house also utilizes light, space and air to include an open floor plan with courtyards, verandas and porches, creating an atmosphere and environment unique to Southern California living.
Team member Christine Tanguay, a fifth-year majoring in architecture, said the project does more than provide sustainably built solar homes.
“Many people often repeat this process of getting up in the morning, going to work, then going home,” Tanguay said. “There can be rare interaction with the outdoor environment. Thus, the architectural idea of this solar home is to create a series of features that will bring the outside environment inside and the indoor participants back outside.”
Paige, a visiting critic at the School of Architecture, said the fluxHome will include elements that provide for  the use of more natural light and solar energy. The light will come from light-harvesting openings and its attached chimney will provide additional skylight.
The Solar Decathlon is a two-week competition that will take place in October in Irvine, Calif. The solar homes will be judged on their architectural merit, market appeal, the functionality of their engineering, the ability of installing appliance within the home and affordability. The sections will be judged by a jury of professionals that specialize in each of the fields.
Team members believe this experience has benefits that extend past the October competition.
“This is an unprecedented opportunity,” Tanguay said. “I saw the opportunity to combine both architecture and sustainability as a wonderful experience.”
The model homes will be deconstructed to travel to the competition and each university has 10 days to rebuild its entry for the competition.
USC’s solar home will be mostly  constructed on campus, then transported to the competition in three separate pieces. After the competition, the solar home will be donated as a residential home to a family in Los Angeles.
Many of the students on the solar decathlon team had little to no previous experience with construction. Many team members consulted L.A. professionals to maximize the design of the solar home.
Team member Justin Kang, a graduate student in the master of architecture program, said the experience provides students with real-world solutions.
“The learning process itself is very valuable,” Kang said. “Not only do we design, but we apply these solutions to the real world as well.”
Paige noted that because participants applied their academic lessons to complete the project, they gained a deeper understanding of the skills needed to succeed in the fields of architecture and engineering.
“Students are no longer spectators in their own sport, relegated to making small-scale models and abstract representations … but instead  they work at a range of scales from the diagram to the detail,” Paige said.
With the competition approaching, students are excited to begin construction of the full-scale prototype this semester on the South Lawn adjacent to Watt Hall and the Fisher Museum of Art.
According to Kimm, the best is yet to come.
“The most rewarding experience for me is watching the growth of students and the amount of skill and knowledge they have learned,” Kimm said. “Yet, it’s all so real and applicable … I can’t wait to see their faces when they walk through the completed solar home … this is a rare opportunity for students but the best is yet to come.”
Team USC members said they hope to enter future Solar Decathlon competitions. The team welcomes the assistance and involvement of students from a variety of disciplines, including architecture, engineering, business, communications and cinema.
After it is constructed, the house will be tested during the summer.

I recently moved to a house in the high desert. It is quite remarkable how one can take advantage of passive heating and cooling because of the design of the house and the landscaping. I look forward to incorporating other solar options at some point. I will be following Team USC’s participation in the Solar Decathlon with great interest.

The Undergraduate Student Government senate voted Tuesday to change the policy for granting Latin honors to graduating transfer students.
Deliberation · Undergraduate Student Government senators debate resolutions Tuesday night. The senate passed resolutions relating to transfer students’ GPA’s and a student representative on the tuition board. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The policy calls for the administration to eliminate the practice of calculating grade point averages from other universities when considering a student for Latin honors.
The three levels of Latin honors are cum laude, magna cum laude and summa cum laude. The honors are given to students with at least a 3.5 GPA or higher. They are awarded to a senior at graduation.
To determine if a student has met the requirements for this senior distinction, both their residence work and transfer work from the previous college are considered. Currently, the university uses the lower GPA to award the Latin honor.
the assistant director of academic affairs Michael Yoshimura believes that this resolution will not harm the transfer student population.
“It can only positively affect a student because the [current] policy only takes the lower one,” Yoshimura said. “By taking the USC one it won’t affect them and it will positively affect their GPA.”
Transfer students make up 29 percent of the undergraduate student population. Of the 17,500 undergraduate students, 6,640 of those are transfer students from other colleges. The average transfer GPA is 3.6 in 2012.
According to the university’s guidelines on admitting transfer students, the rigor of the student’s previous college or university is considered. The administration does not consider the student’s previous grade point average after they are admitted into the university. It is only later used for the purposes of determining which seniors receive Latin honors.
Residential senator Sarah Loh views this new policy as a way to equalize the system for all students. Loh co-authored the resolution along with Yoshimura.
“It’s kind of like leveling the playing field,” Loh said. “The whole student body population benefits because this is the school you’re graduating from and the caliber of work here is the same.”
According to the U.S. News and World Report college rankings, 16 of the top 25 universities grant Latin honors to graduating seniors. Eleven of those universities, including Harvard, Yale and UCLA, only consider the residence coursework of their students when determining which Latin honors a student should receive. Yoshimura and Loh felt that the university should follow the same policy.
Loh believes the transfer student population will respond positively to the change in policy if adopted by the administration.
“It doesn’t negatively affect them and it’s a way that they can be compared to their classmates without using a GPA that is not irrelevant,” Loh said. “I don’t foresee any negative responses.”
Some students viewed a change in the policy as disadvantageous to students who had strong grades in their previous college coursework.
“Personally I wouldn’t want them to get rid of it,” said Joy Ohiomoba, a freshman majoring in global health. “It’s a gamble because it puts [transfer students] at a disadvantage because they could get a lower honor. I like the idea of the administration factoring other coursework in.”
Some students felt the policy change was a matter of bringing more uniformity to the way the administration determines undergraduate honors.
“If you come from an easier or harder school, either way it’s detrimental and unfair,” said Victoria McSweeney, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “They should change the policy no matter what because you’re going to USC so it should be your USC GPA that is being considered, not your GPA from another school.”
Senators also updated a resolution that added a student representative on the tuition board. The student representative would serve to better understand how the administration determines tuition prices.
