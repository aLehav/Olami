Charlotte Wulff | Daily Trojan
When I left my apartment to join the first USC tailgate of the year, I could not believe my eyes. Campus was a sea of red and yellow, with the occasional white skirt and gladiator helmet. Students, but also alumni and other USC community members, were rocking the University’s logo and happily clinking their red cups to the phrase, “Fight On” whilst making peace signs. When I saw parents flood the campus with their adorable children dressed in little Trojan and cheerleader costumes, I knew what it really meant to be part of the “Trojan Family.”
I had seen eager students wearing USC apparel during the first two weeks of classes, but I never expected things to get this crazy. Campus was speckled with tents and taco stands, and the Row was one big party. It was as if everybody was suddenly friends, bonded together over a sporting event and booze. Even random people on the streets who clearly had no connection to USC were wearing Trojans shirts.
I absolutely loved it.
Eventually night came, beckoning a red and yellow sea of people towards the Coliseum. Never in my life had I been in a stadium this large, and I watched the whole spectacle in awe. The band, the cheerleaders, the Song Girls… It was more like an amazing show than a sports game.
Having seen all this, I understand why the Trojan alumni network is so valuable. As a student of USC, you develop such a deep-rooted connection with this community that you will want to continue contributing to it long after graduation. I find that so cool.
This school spirit thing is a totally new concept to me, because it does not really exist back home for several reasons:
All of these factors contribute to a general detachment of Dutch students when it comes to their educational institutions. This in no way means that it is not fun to study in the Netherlands — au contraire! Where we lack loyalty to our universities, we make up for it with our powerful student organizations and social groups. We also host a raging nightlife made possible by a sensible drinking age of eighteen as well as a very intense sorority and fraternity life. Although you will never see me wearing an “Erasmus University of Rotterdam” sweater, I wear my student organization and sorority apparel with pride. And from now on, I will also wear a Trojans shirt on game day.

“College is the time of your life.”
“I wish I could go back, don’t you just wish you could go back?!”
“First year college student — oh my god, it’s the best!”
These are the voices you hear echoing in your head as you’re trying to get adjusted.
The voice of your mom’s best friend with the heavy East Coast accent, the voice of your grandpa reminiscing on his glory days, the voice of the recent college grad trying to live vicariously through you — “college, college, college!”
Society makes it difficult to have your own, independent ideas sometimes — always putting pressure on you to think like everyone else. In my mere 19 years, the pressure to be the perfect “college freshman” is one of the most prominent I’ve come across.
College is about meeting new people every day. It’s about getting out of your comfort zone, trying new things that could become your passion. It’s about partying, studying and partying some more. It’s about eating pepperoni pizza at 3 a.m., exploring new cities at the brink of dawn, falling in and out of love and no one telling you what to do.
That all sounds pretty great, and it should be great. It only took you seven tutors, 81 practice tests, three SATs, two ACTs and 11 drafts of your “personal statement” to get here.
But realistically it doesn’t happen so fast. You’re not having the time of your life the second you arrive. Like anything, it takes a little time. Most likely you’re coming from a place you’ve been your entire life — where you’ve finally gotten comfortable. Then, right when you don’t feel completely awkward in high school anymore, you’re throwing off your graduation cap and shoved into a new city with unfamiliar faces. Suddenly you have no idea where anything is, and you’re expected to just go.
And not just “go,” but to be the perfect specimen of a human. You’re expected to be doing well in all your classes, to have joined a sorority or fraternity, to have made tons of friends, to act like an adult and to have the time of your life because I mean it’s college, the best time of your life!
This is where the social media comes into play.
Every college freshman does it. I myself am not exempt. Go check any of our Instagrams, Snapchats, Facebook profiles, and on some level, I promise you it will be present.
It’s the, “Oh my god, look everyone, I’m having so much fun just like you said I would, I’m so well adjusted and perfectly comfortable already!” post.
Whether you’re tearing up the streets of the Big Apple at NYU, at some small liberal arts college on the East Coast, “going blue,” or “going greek,” at the big M, or fighting on at ’SC, we all obviously need to remind the rest of society, each other and, most importantly, ourselves just how much fun we’re having.
It’s the new profile picture of you carelessly lying in a freshly mowed lawn, sunglasses on, or the snap story of the sunset on your newly renovated campus. It’s the Instagram of us here on game day at ’SC (or Berkeley, or Wiscosin or Michigan) dancing on a table, game day gear on with all of your new best friends. #Bestdayever when all you really want to do is tweet @collegestudent, “Where do I go in college to hysterically cry?”
It’s a natural human instinct to only put forth your best self on social media. It’s another way for us to make sure everyone knows “yes, I’m having a good time, I made the right choice, I am okay.”
However. even if we are having a great time at school, social media is literally and figuratively behind a filter. It’s not what any of our lives look like up close and personal.
We all probably spent a little too long trying to figure out how to work the washing machines the first time we had to do our laundry, or have been more than a couple minutes late to class because we couldn’t find the building.
On some level, we all have no idea what we’re doing. So we’re probably all going to keep posting our photos and making it seem like we have all our acts together. In reality, we might not, but soon enough we will, and we may actually feel as content and in place as social media makes you think we are.
Until then, fight on.

Salvador Hernandez still remembers when he started working at USC almost 25 years ago, even down to the day he first stepped on campus — April 9, 1991. The school was smaller back then, he said, and quieter, a good environment for his work as a janitor, which often required him to clean nearly every building on campus. He has lived close to USC almost from the beginning, but he knows that not all University workers have been so lucky.
“I was living inside a house [in South Central] for seven years, and the family there had to leave the house to move to another state, because they couldn’t handle the price,” Hernandez said. “Living here close to USC is a huge privilege, but you have to pay for it.”
Harold Ubeda arrived at USC’s gates much later, working as a janitor at the campus for the past year and a half. Like Hernandez, he too has experienced the difficulties of rising rent and stagnant wages.
“It’s very difficult to live in downtown Los Angeles because when [workers] have to spend 60 to 70 percent of our salary on rent […] we lose the cultural and recreational parts of life,” Ubeda said in Spanish. “We don’t have enough money to buy books, to go to the theater, and we lose those social benefits.”
Both Hernandez and Ubeda feel that the rising cost of rent in the area wouldn’t be as big of a problem if their wages as service workers could keep up, but for them and for the rest of USC’s custodial staff, they say that’s not the case.
On Sept. 9, approximately 200 janitors and custodial staff marched down Trousdale Parkway, holding signs demanding “Justice for Janitors” and shouting “Si! Se Puede,” meaning “Yes! We can” in Spanish. Their motto invoked the United Farm Workers’ rallies of the 1960s, when Hispanic farm workers campaigned for better wages and working conditions in the agriculture industry.
Though the time, place and means of employment are different — the workers today are janitors and custodians, rather than field laborers and grape pickers — the demands are the same. The protesters at USC called for higher wages, increased health care benefits and dignity in the workplace; they passed out flyers urging student and faculty involvement and called on USC President C. L. Max Nikias and Facilities Management Services Associate Vice President John Welsh to take a greater role in improving their situation.
The rally, organized by the Service Employees International Union – United Service Workers West, the labor union representing the custodial staff at USC, grew as a response to issues with contract negotiations between the janitors and their employer, Aramark.
For nearly 20 years, USC has subcontracted its service workers through Aramark rather than hiring them directly. The previous labor contract between Aramark and SEIU, which had been in place since 2012, expired on June 30, leaving 240 workers without a contract until negotiations could settle contentious issues, from wages to health care benefits.
SEIU and Aramark began negotiations in late July and have since gone through at least six rounds of discussions without reaching a conclusion. SEIU demands an increase in the workers’ wages, which currently start at $9.75 per hour, a figure that SEIU spokesman Edmundo Garcia says is unlivable.
“One of the issues that [workers] are facing is the growing rent in Los Angeles. They’re being pushed out of the [South Central] neighborhood, having to drive greater distances,” Garcia said. “We want to make sure that our workers earn wages that give their families opportunities and not have to struggle as far as making it here in Los Angeles.”
Garcia, who serves as the lead contract enforcement specialist at USWW, describes the SEIU’s attitude towards USC as an “open invitation” to join the negotiating table at any time.
“USC is not a direct negotiator, but they still have the ability to put pressure on Aramark and lead the way,” Garcia said. “We don’t want USC to have workers on their campus that are struggling to make a living. This is a top-tier institution, so we think that the work should reflect that.”
The University and Facilities Management Services did not respond to multiple requests for comment, except to say that USC has no part in the negotiations, which are a private matter between SEIU and Aramark.
In an email, Aramark stated that though it “[could] not comment on specifics around union contracts or negotiations,” its representatives and SEIU “have had several meetings and continue to make good progress to date.”
Ultimately, Garcia believes that Aramark’s demands are driven by profit.
“The company is looking for ways to ‘trim the fat’ and make it more efficient, but we want to make sure that it’s not on the workers’ backs at the cost of the workers’ benefits,” Garcia said.
He and the SEIU believe that if USC were to get involved, it would be in line with the values the University aims to promote, which is a view shared by some in the student community, most predominantly those of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation.
Members like Lorelei Christie believe that the University has the power to affect the negotiations, even if it’s not the janitors’ direct employer.
“At a school with so much money, a school that’s actively raising millions of dollars, I find it completely disgusting that we let  workers live under the poverty line or work without a contract,” Christie said. “At a school that has so many resources, I think there’s no reason to not make sure that these janitors have the working conditions they deserve [and] the wages they deserve — because [they’re] members of the Trojan Family.”
Fellow SCALE member Jenny Villegas said the University is not only capable of helping the workers, but that it also has a responsibility to do so.
“I would hope to see USC treat its workers with as much dignity and respect as they treat their football team,” Villegas said. “We need to make sure that the workers that we have that keep the institution running are being paid fairly, treated fairly and getting the treatment they deserve.”
Though significant, the current conflict is far from unique. Janitors at USC, in conjunction with the SEIU, have been protesting on and off for almost two decades.
The struggle began in 1996, when the University decided to hire a subcontractor, ServiceMaster, to provide custodial staff, instead of directly hiring the workers. After this switch, the staff experienced a dramatic decline in wages, benefits and working conditions. They lost their rights to tuition remission for their children and faced intimidation and harassment, Hernandez said.
“Many people were fired, and many left because they could not handle being here,” Hernandez said. “Before the change, I remember we received free tickets to watch the football games. Now, we have nothing like that. Before, it was like a family. Now, it’s like business.”
At the time, USC janitors were not unionized and experienced strong resistance from ServiceMaster when they attempted to gain membership with SEIU. The conflict led to sustained protests throughout much of 1996 and 1997, which made incremental steps toward satisfying the workers’ demands. Finally, in the spring of 1997, after a secret ballot that overwhelmingly favored unionization, the USC janitors were allowed membership into the SEIU and, thus, could begin to negotiate a labor contract.
In 2001, USC switched subcontractors from ServiceMaster to Aramark and negotiations began again. Protests in 2009 and 2012 focused on improving healthcare benefits for workers, who faced greater insurance costs and copay requirements after the expiration of their contract with Aramark.
Today’s workers want to continue the benefits they earned in their previous contract and additionally raise salaries to keep up with the rising cost of rent in the area. Negotiating a new contract, however, can take months, and in the meantime, SEIU is staging rallies in support of the workers while simultaneously calling on the University to take action in the contract negotiations.
“USC is a prestigious institution,” Garcia said. “What happens at that site is going to send ripple effects through the industry. It’s going to set precedents [and] it’s going to impact the largely Latino and black working community that works in our bargaining units and that lives in many of our neighborhoods.”
Hernandez, Ubeda and many other service workers enjoy working at USC but worry that, with the current conditions, they will not be able to afford to work here much longer.
“Our workers are generally very proud to work at USC. Students treat us well, and workers, including me, feel motivated,” Ubeda said. “[But when] we are having to move and being displaced from the South Central neighborhood because we can’t afford the rent here, we can’t maintain the feeling of community.”
To avoid many of these issues, Hernandez said, the solution is simple.
“For every person that loses a position, their family is going to lose money, is going to lose food, is going to lose everything,” Hernandez said. “And they’re going to be afraid of the new changes every time we do negotiations. We need to be treated like people, like human beings.”
I TOTALLY support the janitors and believe they deserve way more (salary, benefits, time-off, etc).
But, unfortunately, this case isn’t the same as the food service workers we saw last year. USC pays Aramark to supply the staff. Aramark determines the wages of the janitors. USC could pressure Aramark to do a better job at caring for the staff but Aramark is one of the largest companies in the nation for this industry and could very easily tell USC to butt out. USC isn’t even in the top 10 largest companies that Aramark works with. They should go picket the Aramark headquarters in Burbank.
Great news that the janitors are taking up the fight. I hope students should do too. It’s about what type of University we want. An academic community, with stress on both words, or an educational corporation where students are consumers, professors and grad students are employees, and janitors are but support staff. That shouldn’t be what life or USC should be about. Yes we can!
The pesky law of supply and demand is alive and well.  Aramark can replace these guys tens times over and still pay minimum wage+ because people are lined up and willing to work for that much.
Janitorial services are a living for the company owners and unions. Not so much for the janitors.

Sophomore Josh Barach recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to turn what started as an Instagram joke into a full-fledged business. With a mission to “[change] the world before he changes his clothes,” Barach takes on the persona of “Mr. Bathrobe Crusader” to spread his love of luxury bathrobes.
It all started when Barach and his friend Benjamin Milstein, a philosophy major at Indiana University, were traveling through Europe together last year. When Barach whipped out his fuzzy blue bathrobe, Milstein remembers being baffled by his packing decisions.
“Historically, Josh has always liked lounging around in a bathrobe,” Milstein said. “But while we were at our first stop in London, he pulled his bathrobe out of a small backpack and I just couldn’t believe my eyes.”
Barach ended up wearing the bathrobe to a few tourist attractions, and soon “Mr. Bathrobe Crusader” was born.
“I actually had my bathrobe on during a tour of the Buckingham Palace and took a picture during the changing of the guard,” Barach said. “That was our first documented photo that went on social media.”
From there, Barach and his friends decided to put together an Instagram account dedicated to following the travels of the elusive Mr. Bathrobe Crusader.
Besides London, Mr. Bathrobe Crusader has been spotted in Amsterdam, Paris, Beaune, Nice, Cannes, Geneva, Saint Tropez, Barcelona, Madrid, Copenhagen and Berlin.
“Most people chuckle when they see me and just think it’s funny,” Barach said. “But there was this one incident in the Musée de l’Orangerie when I got stopped by several security guards, who thought I had something hidden in my robe.”
Barach resolved that situation and went on to leave more lasting impressions for the remainder of his trip. Now that he is back at school, however, Barach wants to focus on a new business opportunity involving bathrobes.
“I honestly think the bathrobe is a lost form of clothing,” Barach said. “Ever since Hugh Hefner in the ’70s, there hasn’t really been anything big with the bathrobe. Not to mention there aren’t a lot of comfortable bathrobes out there.”
Realizing a huge gap in the market for luxury lifestyle bathrobes, Barach wants to create a niche bathrobe, and is hoping to start by targeting greek life and college students.
“My short-term goal is to spread the word and reach $10,000 on my Kickstarter, which I just launched with the help of Ben and our other friend, Yimin,” Barach said.
Yimin Zhang, a freshman majoring in animation and digital arts, was responsible for creating the promotional video for Barach’s Kickstarter.
“I am thrilled to participate in the creation process of an emerging cultural trend,” Zhang said.
So far, 11 backers have pledged $1,274 to the Kickstarter campaign. Barach hopes the number will keep going up, so he can expand the business to include other luxury loungewear and donate some of the profits to charity.
“Eventually, I’d like to sell slippers, sweatpants, towels and things like that,” Barach said. “I’d also like to contribute 20 percent of profits towards the Methuselah Foundation and other projects dedicated to extending healthy lives.”
Currently, Mr. Bathrobe Crusader is keeping the details of this first bathrobe a secret, but he has mentioned he will use “the finest materials” and has already created a design.
The bathrobe is $95 for the first 100 backers on Kickstarter, and future retail value will be $250. Barach realizes this is a steep price but stressed that any luxury lifestyle brand is the same.
“Lululemon makes lifestyle athletic wear, Vilebrequin makes lifestyle swimwear, [Nike’s] Air Jordan makes lifestyle footwear,” Barach said. “But currently there is no luxury lifestyle loungewear, so I’m starting a bathrobe revolution.”
If the success of the first batch is successful, the Bathrobe Crusader plans on releasing a line of other limited edition college and greek life-themed robes.
“I better see everybody wearing bathrobes on the Row next semester,” Barach said.

Blogger Jasmine Zahedi is learning Chinese in Shanghai this semester. Jasmine Zahedi | Daily Trojan
When I decided to study abroad in Shanghai, I knew I wasn’t going to be getting the traditional study abroad experience. I wouldn’t be able to jet set on weekends and explore surrounding countries. But I chose Shanghai for a reason. I wanted to make serious language gains in a short amount of time and experience a completely different culture. After being in Shanghai for almost two weeks, even with the intensive language program that I’m in, I definitely find it hard to stick to my goals and constantly speak Chinese. It’s so easy to revert back to English when my program is only composed of American students. However, I’ve figured out some ways anyone can take their language skills to the next level and have an enriching study abroad experience:
1. Stick to the Language Commitment
If you’re studying abroad in a program that has a language requirement, you may have to make a pledge to only speak the language you’re studying, even if you think it’s embarrassing. Whenever the RAs in my dorm hear any English, they always says “shuo zhong wen, shuo zhong wen,” which means “speak Chinese,” to reinforce the pledge. Even if no one is watching, you should wholly commit to the pledge. That’s how you’ll make the most progress.
2. Live in a Homestay
Though you may be slightly isolated from people who are living in the dorms, you’ll get an inside look into the language and culture of the country you’re studying abroad in. And nothing beats home-cooked meals. One of my friends lives in a homestay and really appreciates the time spent talking to her homestay parents, who are retired and spend most days playing mahjong. However, also make sure to get out every once in a while and get to know students who are living in the dorms.
3. Make Local Friends
I’m not sure about other study abroad programs, but the program I’m in at East China Normal University is completely isolated from the university. I only take classes with students in my program, and the dorm we live in is composed of the same students as well as a handful of international students. Making local friends has been especially difficult since I never have the opportunity to interact with them in class. Luckily, though, each of us is paired with a language tutor who can help us meet other students and become more integrated into the university. Having local friends allows you to not only practice your language skills, but also gives you insight into the culture.
4. Challenge Yourself
Take the harder language class. You’ll be pushed to your limits but by challenging yourself, you’ll make your experience worthwhile and make huge steps in a short amount of time. Based on my placement test, I was actually put in the heritage Chinese class, which I thought didn’t suit me at all since I’m not a heritage Chinese speaker. Instead of moving down, I decided to take on the challenge and go up a level. The class I’m currently in is definitely forcing me to work harder than I ever have before for a language class, but I’m excited to see how much I improve by the end of the semester.
5. Write Down Your Language Goals for the Semester
By having a hard copy of your goals, you’ll be able to hold yourself accountable and will be more likely to actually achieve them. I promised myself that I would commit to speaking Chinese even in situations where English could very well be used, and I plan on achieving this goal by talking to everyone in Chinese, even my American roommate.

It’s that time of year again. As midterms season starts up, get ready for some late study nights. Megha Gupta | Daily Trojan
With the fifth week of school behind us, college students know that midterms are waiting on their doorsteps. If they are anything like me, it means that there are three days left before that test that’s anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of their grade, and desperation has set in so deep that the it has become the inspiration for a new branch of philosophy. Though panic may be far off and that third cup of espresso wipes away any immediate need to sleep (is my hand shaking while I type?), there are definitely a few things one could do to maximize those last 72 hours (or 12) before a midterm:
1. Teamwork
While I would ordinarily say that group work is an easy way for students to contribute unequal amounts of work, distributing the memorizing among students and then collaborating to teach the information is infinitely more productive that slaving over your notes in the wee hours of the morning. Finding a study group or making a Google Doc study guide and splitting up the note taking can ease your load as well as the need to shift through massive amounts of information by dividing it up and conquering it together. It’s also easier to approach that eight-hour time block you made in a Leavey study room when you’re with a group because who wants to be alone on the third floor if they can help it?
2. Find a Veteran From Your Class
The next best thing to do after finding a study group is seek out friends or acquaintances who have taken the class with your professor within the last two semesters. While the material or book may have changed, the way the professor writes exams probably has not, and these people can be a valuable resource for how to tackle difficult problems or oddly worded prompts. Bonus points if you can use these people to get ahold of past exams, too.
3.  Go to Office Hours
Office hours are definitely not only for people who legitimately have questions about lecture material. They can also be utilized to clarify things like what sort of questions will be asked, which topics students struggle with most and how to answer short answer or short essay questions. This method is not always the most effective or reliable way to prepare for an exam and depends on the professor, but it can definitely help you guide your study focus more.
4. Overwhelmed Beyond the Point of Studying?
As always, your own health comes before pushing yourself to your mental extremes. If all-consuming anxiety is all that you feel at this point, maybe going to the health center and getting some counseling is not a ridiculous idea. According to the American Psychological Association, 41.6 percent of college students experience anxiety, followed by 36.4 percent who experience symptoms of depression. These numbers have been increasing for the last few years and indicate that students should seek professional help when they need it in order to avoid growing problems they may be experiencing. Knowing when too much is too much will most likely benefit you more than cramming in that last few hours for those procrastinated GE readings.
As always, there are plenty of ways to deal with midterm stress, but hopefully a few of these will work out better for you and maybe get you that extra three to four hours of rest before the big test.

After winning the Pac-12 Conference in 2012 and 2013, the Women of Troy look to add on another championship this year. They have been competing in the ITF Pro Circuit tournament in Las Vegas.
The ITF Las Vegas is an annual tournament held at the Red Rock Country Club and begins with over 200 talented women’s tennis players from across the globe. Six Women of Troy competed in the tournament.
Freshmen Rianna Valdes and Jessica Failla, sophomore Gabby Smith and senior Giuliana Olmos won in the first round of qualifying, but all four of the women lost in hard-fought battles in the second round. Valdes and Olmos each lost in straight sets while Failla and Smith each fell after two sets.
The tournament was excellent practice for the upcoming season this spring. The Women of Troy hope to take this loss and learn from it, so when spring comes they are ready to beat any school that stands in their way.
This week did have some good news for the women’s tennis team, however. Former Trojan tennis player Zoë Scandalis was named one of nine finalists for the NCAA Woman of the Year award. This is an elite award that goes to a former college athlete that made significant acheivements on and off the court. Scandalis, who graduated last spring, was a two-time All American and made four appearances in the NCAA tournament. The winner of this prestigious award will be announced in Indianapolis on Oct. 18.

It’s not often that a quarterback completes nearly 70 percent of his passes, throws 39 touchdowns to just five interceptions, racks up nearly 4,000 yards and still goes as unnoticed as Cody Kessler. Those were Kessler’s numbers last season when his team went 9-4, so Kessler flying under the radar could be attributed to him being on a mediocre team with a first-year head coach. But this season, Kessler leads the nation with 15 touchdowns against FBS opponents and has only thrown one interception on the season.
Heading into the season, the Trojans were ranked No. 8 and then moved up to No. 6 after wins against Arkansas State and Idaho, but dropped to              No. 19 after a loss to Stanford. The Trojans’ play as a whole was disappointing against Stanford, but Kessler’s, in particular, was not. Unfortunately for Kessler, he seems to be an underrated quarterback on an overrated team.
In this season’s lone loss, Kessler completed 78 percent of his passes and threw for three touchdowns. At that point, he still hadn’t thrown an interception. He managed to put up 31 points, which should’ve been enough to keep his team in the game. In fact, it was the defense, which allowed Kevin Hogan and the Cardinal to put up 41 points, that really lost the game for the Trojans. Still, Kessler took a lot of the blame for his team’s loss.
Kessler and the Trojans entered last week’s game against Arizona State facing a         must-win situation and they delivered with a 42-14 win over their Pac-12 South rivals, who many thought had a chance to come out on top of the Pac-12 South.
Kessler threw an early interception at the goal line, his first of the season, but bounced back with five touchdown passes for 375 yards. His longest touchdown of the night registered at 80 yards. And yet still, somehow, people have decided that Arizona State lost the game more than USC really won it. And I don’t entirely disagree with that notion, though I think anyone who puts up five touchdown passes deserves a little credit.
Kessler’s Heisman chances certainly took a hit with USC’s loss to Stanford, but his personal statistics did not. He has a great supporting cast around him on offense, an offense that has for the most part looked explosive. Sophomore Adoree’ Jackson has even said that he has his sights set on winning a Heisman of his own, and he absolutely could. Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has put up incredible numbers to match Kessler’s, so there is certainly no shortage of talent or production on the offensive side.
Before the season started, the media was high on the Trojans, but it didn’t take much for them to change their minds. One loss to a Pac-12 rival and the Trojans dropped 13 spots. Alabama lost to fellow SEC team Ole Miss and was still ranked ahead of teams with no losses.
Aside from UCLA, the rest of the Pac-12 does not look as strong holistically. This also hurts Kessler. The fact that an SEC team can lose and still be as highly regarded as Alabama just goes to show the way the SEC is favored over the Pac-12.
Kessler’s Heisman hopes are not completely tarnished, but he’ll definitely have to win out and continue putting up big numbers to beat out his opponents in the SEC and Big 12. He’ll need big performances from his team, and he’ll absolutely have to beat Josh Rosen on Nov. 28.

After a sweep of crosstown rival No. 11 UCLA in Westwood and a thrilling five-set victory against No. 8-ranked Stanford in Palo Alto, two of USC’s seniors were named Pac-12 Volleyball Offensive and Defensive Players of the Week.
Senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms was voted as Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week for the first time in her career, while senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for a record fourth time this season, a feat that no player in conference history has ever accomplished.
The senior duo led then-No. 3 USC to a pair of road victories to start conference play undefeated, while also pushing their record to a spotless 14-0 overall. Now, USC sits towards the top of the AVCA national rankings at No. 2 overall, 20 spots higher than their ranking of No. 22 during the preseason.
With the award, Bricio also becomes the most lauded player in USC history, as this marks her seventh time winning Offensive Player of the Week. She is the seventh player in conference history to receive weekly honors seven times or more in her career.
On Sunday, the Women of Troy stormed Maples Pavilion and earned a dramatic five-set come-from-behind victory against the Cardinal to keep their perfect record intact and remain undefeated in conference play.
It certainly wasn’t a pretty win, with a combined 46 hitting and serving errors on the evening for the Women of Troy, but USC went the distance for the first time this season and was able to pull out the gutsy  (26-24, 19-25, 20-25, 25-17, 15-13) victory in Palo Alto. USC now improves to 14-0 on the season and 2-0 in Pac-12 play while Stanford drops to 7-3, 1-1 in conference.
Even though his team did not play all that well, head coach Mick Haley thought his players could learn a lot from their performance in a tough environment.
“I think this win means we can certainly get a lot better, but now they know how to win when they’re not at their best. They’ve got a great team concept and they’re playing off each other’s enthusiasm,” Haley said.
Bricio had yet another   career-high performance, this time scoring a personal best of 34.0 points on a game-high 27 kills, 10 digs, three blocks and five service aces. The Women of Troy had 63 kills compared to Stanford’s 56, with Bricio accounting for 43 percent of her team’s kills.
“Her performance today is why I think she’s a serious candidate for Player of the Year. When a player steps up like that in every facet — serving, passing, blocking and hitting — you can win a lot of games even when the rest of the team isn’t playing so well. Her play was huge,” Haley said.
Ogoms had a whopping nine blocks on the afternoon, good enough for match-high honors, while also adding eight kills on a .438 hitting clip. Junior setter Alice Pizzasegola directed the USC offense with 34 assists and eight digs, while junior libero Taylor Whittingham had a match-high 15 digs.
USC’s three freshman starters all provided significant contributions on the afternoon as well. Setter Baylee Johnson filled the stat sheet with a solid all-around effort, adding 17 assists, five kills, nine digs and five blocks, while outside hitter Alyse Ford finished second on the team with 12 kills. Victoria Garrick, a first-year defensive specialist playing in front of her family and friends, tallied 14 digs in the back row to finish second on the team and added one service ace.
Haley was proud of how his young players fought throughout the match.
“The freshmen really grew up tonight. They had their ups and downs, and each one of them had stuff to work through, but they’re learning how to do it and they’re gaining experience,” Haley said. “When we can win to go with that experience, that just gives them more and more self confidence.”
After a tight 26-24 first set victory, USC fell behind in the match after Stanford won two straight sets. This would be the first time all season that the Women of Troy have dropped more than one set in a game. The fourth set, however, went USC’s way with a 25-17 win, forcing the fifth and decisive set. Bricio added six kills in the frame to solidify the 15-13 comeback victory.
With the win, USC snapped Stanford’s 27-match home winning streak at Maples Pavilion, their first loss since USC beat them in five sets back in October 2013. The Women of Troy also remain one of five unbeaten NCAA Division I teams this season.
USC will now head home for a pair of conference games against the Washington schools. The Washington State Cougars come to the Galen Center on Friday, Oct. 2 at 7:00 p.m. to take on the Women of Troy in the first game of the series. Then on Sunday, Oct. 4, No. 2-ranked USC and No. 5-ranked Washington face off for an afternoon top 10 showdown at 1:00 p.m.
“We have to take it one game at a time. Now we have to put this win behind us and think about Washington State next,” Haley said. “They’re going to come to Galen and try and do the same thing we did to Stanford on our home court, so after tonight our focus has to shift to the Cougars.”

Students Sarah Dhanaphatana and David Moreno returned to campus late Sunday night after representing USC at a Harvard Institute of Politics conference “Campus Activation: Increasing Student Voting and Political Engagement” over the weekend.
Undergraduates from across the country traveled to Harvard University to participate in the conference, which featured lectures from political practitioners, expert organizers and noteworthy journalists on voter registration and campus political engagement.  The lectures focused on ways to encourage millennials to vote through techniques such as technology.   
“We definitely focused in on communication strategies with new technologies and ways to really connect with young voters,” said Dhanaphatana, a junior majoring in political science and deputy features editor of the Daily Trojan. “We didn’t focus on one particular candidate that might have been doing well, [but] rather which candidate created a sense of authenticity when they were using social media.”
One or two representatives each from 27 colleges and universities attended the Harvard conference. Participating schools are members of the Institute of Politics’ “National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement,” a group colleges and universities that aims to encourage young people to get involved in politics and public service.
Only 22 percent of people ages 18-29, voted in the 2014-midterm elections, which was 13 percent of the total votes casted, according to CIRCLE news, which monitors the trends in young voters. 
Moreno, a senior majoring in political science, said one of the more engaging workshops was a discussion and Q&A session with Congressman Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) called “The Importance of Engaging Millennials in the 2016 Election.”
“An interesting thing that we touched on, in terms of the challenges that our generation face, is that a lot of politicians see us more as [people] who can vote for them and get them elected, versus individuals who can actually add to the discussion and contribute to making changes,” Moreno said.
Lecturers such as John Della Volpe, director of polling at the IOP, shared his expertise with students on initiatives to improve voter turnout in young communities. He is a leading authority on global trends, opinions and influences, and contributes regularly to news outlets such as the Huffington Post, The Atlantic and the Wall Street Journal.
“[Volpe] reversed the roles and wanted to hear from us and what our generation was like,” Moreno said. “That was really intriguing in that it showed that even though we all vary on a lot of things on the political spectrum, there were a lot of issues we all felt deeply passionate about, such as college affordability, K-12 education, healthcare and race relations.”
USC’s effort to increase college voting was evident on Sept. 22, when students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan for National Voter Registration Day, a nationwide event that aims to promote greater participation in elections. 549 students registered to vote at the event, nearly double the amount that registered last year. Student representatives at the Harvard IOP Conference over the weekend compared and contrasted voter registration events on their own campuses to try and better student involvement.
“It was intriguing getting to learn about some of the other national voter registration organizations and the methods they utilize for reaching out to students,” Moreno said. “Learning what our peers at other colleges do in regards to campus events and participation was insightful, and will definitely help [our] planning for the 2016 election and beyond.” 
USC received an award for its participation in National Voter Registration Day from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, but Dhanaphatana said that the USC student community should not stop there.  
“The thing that I am most concerned about at USC, given the fact that we have had things like a good turnout at National Voter Registration day, is keeping the momentum up because we really need to get students out there realizing how impactful their voices are,” Dhanaphatana said. “Legislators are voting on such impactful issues that are directly affecting us, so it is important we all be educated in them.”
Dhanaphatana noted the diversity of schools that were represented at the event.
“We all come from different backgrounds. We are split between party lines, but there is always something a group of college students can agree on and I think that’s what’s so empowering,” she said.

For all the criticism millennials receive, we are truly a generation of getting things done. Or so it seems on social media.
Last weekend an incident of racial injustice against our Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath got that ball rolling. It led to national media coverage, a blast email from the University entitled “Important message to the USC Campus Community” and a Facebook status by Sampath that as of Monday had generated more than 10,000 likes.
Literally thousands of people were supportive of Sampath and expressed their outrage on social media that an incident like this could still occur. It seemed like for the first time in a long time a change was going to come in how USC acknowledged and responded to racial injustice. A student leader experienced an unfortunately all-too-common reality of living in America. She effectively used her position to speak truth to power.
Yet, as talk buzzed around campus, a common sentiment I heard was that there was no point in having this conversation again. We knew it existed. Intolerance has always existed. The next incident of racial injustice would happen soon, and it would negate all the work that Sampath, USG and Student Affairs was trying to do.
It seemed like last week brought up the underlying problem of “racial fatigue” within this generation. I was not immune to this experience. The spotlight, which seemed temporal, felt eerily similar to other times race was a hot topic issue around campus. There was shock, then statements, but ultimately silence on the issue.
Institutional change remains evasive for millennials. It’s not from lack of trying. For millennials, it is difficult for us to orchestrate long-term advocacy because our lives are built on instant gratification.
We’re used to seeing change happen quickly. During our lifetimes, we’ve had dramatic technological advancements in the ways that we communicate with one another. Social media and the internet bring us a stream of quality products, news and ideas instantly. So for us, why should our perception of social change be any different?
In the 1960s, an era that we usually confine the Civil Rights Movement to, change was slow coming by our standards. For those leaders, it took a lot of bootstrapping, failures and revisions. Many of the accomplishments of that era were built on the back of generations before them, on thousands of people who never saw their work come to fruition.
Millennials’ use of social media to share information has dramatically changed the way we orchestrate and assess social movements, according to USC professor Shana Redmond, who has taught a class called “Post-Civil Rights Black America.” Social media creates a facade, she said.
“Tweeting and Facebook do not make a social movement,” Redmond wrote in an email. “Change is most successfully measured over the long term and on a wide scale. This is a project that social media, with its investment in immediate gratification, is ill-equipped to allow.”
With technology, not much about our day and lifestyle has to change to feel like we’ve done something. That’s kind of technology’s caveat. This cannot translate over to how we approach social movements. Social change actually requires more of us than we are used to giving.
We cannot go back to the time before technology was used for social movements; it has already indelibly rooted itself in our lives. It’s sped up the way we millennials must interact with the world. We have to turn in assignments on Blackboard at a certain time, respond to emails quickly and be expected to be available at all hours of the day through texting. Our world has put so many more pressures on us that the groundwork for changes in the future just doesn’t seem as time-sensitive and urgent as our checklist for today.
But it is.
As a senior, the conversations we’re having about racial tolerance and inclusion at USC might not affect me in the new policies that are instated. I will probably not be a beneficiary of the new cultural house for black students and calls for a vice president for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion proposed by the Daily Trojan editorial board. I graduate in May and, from my experience, change — true and overarching change — doesn’t come in seven months.
But there’s currently a group of students filling out their Common App to be part of the class of 2020 at USC. So we should start making tangible changes for them so that their experiences at USC are better than ours. This, in turn, protects our legacy.
If you’re looking for ways to do that, attend the diversity talks on campus. Set aside time this week — in between our rush from this class to that club — to think about how you are part of the whole. It’s time for us to overcome that feeling of racial fatigue and realize that we’re part of a civil rights movement — right now.

A week has passed since my story went viral. Since then, the University put out a statement encouraging others to report incidents of bias. While our University has noted this letter has led to the reporting of more incidents of bias within the past week than within the past year, it’s not enough. There’s so much more to accomplish, and we’ve known this for years now.
I understand the anger and frustration. Encouraging reporting isn’t enough. Words of apology aren’t enough. It’s difficult to find confidence in reporting procedures when we do not know the effectiveness of such systems. It’s difficult to trust in words of sympathy when deep inside, you are left to question if such words are merely apathy in disguise.
And it’s not as if my narrative is anything new: The USChangemovement was formed in 2013 as a response to how black students on this campus are treated. The RISE Student Alliance and sexual assault prevention advocates have fought against the silencing of survivors. Our cultural resource centers and cultural assemblies have routinely asked for greater resources, support and space to help the students they serve.
This is why, for some students, it’s frustrating to see my story receive so much coverage from everyone from the Los Angeles Times to Teen Vogue to the Washington Post. I get it. After all, why is my story any more valid than the stories of my peers? It’s not.
This story is not about me. Yes, I chose to speak up, but so have my peers for years now: They have spoken up through Title IX complaints, through meetings with administrators, through student government resolutions. So, to the media: My story has sold you papers, it has earned you clicks, likes and shares. There are students who do not hold the same office as me, but whose lived experiences are equally as important, if not more important, than mine. So I ask you to do this — please, report on these narratives. Your microphones, cameras and pens have a transformative power.
To the USC administration: As simple as it is to ask the student body to come up with the innovative solutions to these problems, the onus is on you to move proactively instead of reactively. We can’t wait for 700 angry students to fill a ballroom only for the administration to move on from the issue after the news cameras leave. News cycles will pass, but prejudice does not.
My colleagues at Undergraduate Student Government and I urge you to attend the forum on Wednesday entitled,“Voices of USC: The Diversity Climate on Campus,” from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Ronald Tutor Campus Center Room 450. Administrators, including our provost, will be in attendance. This is only the continuation of a discussion that has taken place for many years.
This is a human rights issue that is not limited to one community. It is pervasive throughout our campus. We have all been, at some point in our lives, made to feel lesser than what we are. We need allies from all communities to participate if we want to make progress.
Yes, there will be those who believe speaking out brings bad publicity to our University. Yet, if we are truly committed to the betterment of USC, we must face these challenges head-on. There will be those who subscribe to a victim-blaming mindset and doubt the veracity of our testimonies, despite what convincing evidence there is (as my little sister pointed out, some people still doubt the moon landing). There will be those who attempt to trivialize our experiences or find it so bothersome to discuss these issues.
These are the opinions we can only hope to change through education and awareness. And in the meantime, we cannot forget about those who are invested in these principles. There is a certain side of history for us to choose to be on, and I know the majority of my peers will choose the right one, despite what hatred there still is in our world. We cannot let the negativity derail the cause to validate the experiences of our peers and find solutions for injustice; we must remain steadfast in our values and continue the pursuit of justice.
It’s your turn. It has always been your turn. See you on Wednesday.

In fall 2013, when my freshman class sat in Norris Cinema Theatre and officially began our tenure at the School of Cinematic Arts, we were told our education would span far past the reaches of our classrooms and into the real world. We would be crewing on sets, getting hands-on experience behind the camera and paving our way through the industry by acquiring internships. It was apparently a given that if you went to film school at USC, you would forge connections that made the thick city smog and impossible parking all worth it.
While my high school friends went off to various places across the nation for college, I came to USC as a native Angeleno fully prepared to spend another four years in the city in order to gain this lifelong network. With this mentality in mind, I was eager to start my working life, but had little idea of how to do it. Though Dean Elizabeth Daley tells SCA students that internships are just one of the many benefits to our school, we weren’t given many options for learning how to acquire them. The SCA job board — available exclusively to past and present SCA students — is one tool at our fingertips, but in the last two and a half years at interning, I’ve learned that most of the jobs that my friends and I have had didn’t come from there.
Luckily, my first foot into the entertainment industry’s door was at a small production company with a first look deal at Fox Studios. They were situated on the Fox lot in a tiny bungalow and had advertised a summer internship position on the aforementioned job board. I was one of the first to apply, and subsequently, one of the first to be hired once interviewed. It was exciting. They had amazing properties they were trying to develop, and a never-ending stream of interesting talent walking through the door (Stan Lee, anyone?). The company was headed by three men and one male assistant, and I found out later that only female interns were hired.
Now, that’s not to say that this statistic was in any way a conscious decision on behalf of the people that hired us. It actually turned out to be one of the most supportive and fun environments I’ve had the fortune to work in. But it did make me wonder.
My next internship was with a bigger production company in Hollywood, which I had the chance to interview for because of a friend who had interned there the previous semester. I was officially not depending on the SCA job board or USC anymore but was working purely from my own interpersonal skills and past experience. Later, I learned that I was one of five interns hired — only one of whom was a man. Again, this didn’t pose any trouble for me at that moment or after, but it was interesting.
Now I work for a male writer who I know purposefully hires women to work around him. Which is great because I love my job, and I know my gender wasn’t the only reason I was hired, though it helped. I’ve also interviewed (and been accepted to) other internships where the workforce was composed of mostly women. But considering this column is mostly centered on the disproportionately negative numbers of women and minorities working in the industry in high-ranking jobs, it made me wonder: Who are the jobs going to and how?
Most of the internships that I have held have been in the company of other female interns. If we’re told on the first day of school that the way to create our futures is through interning and meeting people, the boys at the school are faring, post-graduation, pretty well for their lack of experience. Several male colleagues I know haven’t, nor will, work an internship — either because they weren’t hired or they don’t want to. According to Intern Bridge, 77 percent of unpaid internships are awarded to women. These numbers, however, then radically shift after we all walk across that stage together, throw our caps into the sky and officially “enter the job market.” Articles published by The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film and New York Film Academy’s annual publication, among others, show that women are in the minority when it comes to jobs like producers, editors, cinematographers, writers and directors. This positive gender bias toward women begin and end in clerical positions such as internships and assistant positions — where the jobs are as menial as fielding calls, reading scripts and fetching coffee. Are we destined to maintain and perpetuate this type of Mad Men-esque position as our male counterparts skip the internship positions and jump right into working in the field, regardless of past experience or who’s right for the job?
Granted, I know my test group is small compared to the entirety of the industry, but it does make me think about the inherent inequality in film.

With a two-year gap since the release of their freshman album, Settle, Disclosure is back with the highly anticipated Caracal, an album that loses the energy and rapturous pop hooks of their debut.
In Settle, the English electronic music duo created the right balance between dance and pop music. Brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence made a statement, reminiscent of the earlier days of house music. Settle did not feature big drops. In fact, it seemed to function well without them, though guests would soon become household names such as Sam Smith, AlunaGeorge and London Grammar. The record’s summer vibes were filled with sweetness and sunshine. But seasons change. The group has grown from their humble beginnings playing for friends at local clubs to making appearances at some of the world’s major music festivals nowadays.
Caracal does not begin with a banger, but rather with “Nocturnal,” a minimal dance number featuring vocals from The Weekend that do not give Disclosure room enough to breathe.
The second track features Sam Smith, yet again. “Omen,” the album’s lead single, clearly tries to mimic the success of “Latch,” by highlighting Smith’s silky vocals and Disclosure’s blooming beats. But while catchy and dynamic, “Omen” lacks the infectious frisky nature of “Latch.”
“Jaded,” is the first all-Disclosure piece on the record. The track features vocals from Howard along with a unique under-driven melody that steers the album in a more production-heavy direction from this point on.
“Echoes” is the second all-Disclosure solo piece the duo delivers. The synth-heavy track includes some of the album’s best lyrical works: “Don’t you remember anything that you said / Forgot the memories that fell through the net / you go on and on / I can sing along ’cause you’re the echo that’s in my head.”
In Caracal, there are no surprises, no risks. Some collaborations, such as those with LION BABE, Gregory Porter and Miguel, dissolve into the background. Lorde’s vocals on “Magnets” sound aloof. Disclosure’s reliance on guest appearances causes them to forget their innovative sound launched them into success in the first place. Caracal is a dark album with lower BPM, minimal production and more self-serious lyrics. It is closer to R&B than pop. From the first song to the last, Caracal is an album with not-that-catchy generic R&B tracks. Though the majority of the tracks are average, none fall flat. Disclosure had big shoes to fill in following the success of Settle.
The Lawrence brothers know what works best for them — radio-friendly house beats with soulful vocals. Though the response to Settle was overwhelmingly positive, instead of continuing their innovative path the English duo followed the same template they used in the past. In many ways, Disclosure is victim of its own success. Caracal would be perfect if the tracks were scattered throughout a house party mix but when listened during one sitting, it becomes an undefined mush. Caracal is in need of something extra.  It leaves listeners reaching for something more — and it just isn’t there.
The duo is set to celebrate the release of their sophomore album Sept. 29 with a performance at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Dear Tiffany,
I’m a freshman trying to find who my best friends will be here at college. I can’t help but feel like I’m the only one who hasn’t found that person or group that I “click” with. 
I’ve been hanging out with the girls down the hall in my dorm, but they’re pretty reserved and never want to explore campus events or go to parties. I’ve seen this group of other girls that seem to always be having fun and share my sense of humor. I really want to hang out with them! But I don’t know how to move on from this other group of boring (sorry!) girls I’ve fallen in with … I don’t want to hurt feelings or make things awkward. 
-Friend FOMO
Why not be friends with both groups of girls if you’re concerned about offending? Don’t feel bad looking for people you click with, but there’s no need to burn any bridges either. 
If befriending the whole group of fun girls seems intimidating, a more manageable first step is to hang out with a few you already know. Next time there’s an event or party you want to check out, suggest rolling through together. Or, ask them to get lunch somewhere besides the dining hall, because I’m sure EVK is getting old already. You’ve just got to make an effort.
It may seem like everyone else has their group already, but these groups may not even last through the semester. At USC, it’s likely you’ll find friend-soulmates after freshman year as well. Don’t get too down about it, it’s only been a month! 
Dear Tiffany,
You seem relatively hip and “with it.” What is your advice on being “cool”?
*Disclaimer: I’m only relatively hip*
It’s cool to always be unyieldingly yourself and to not care about being cool.

I like surprises. What I saw on Saturday in the sizzling atmosphere of Tempe, Arizona was definitely a surprise. And I’m not complaining. The Trojans came out with redemption in their eyes. I’m not sure whether it was from the heartbreaking defeat last year against the Sun Devils or whether it was from the beating they received from the Cardinal last week. But one thing I am sure of is that USC showed it was capable of bouncing back. This is a crucial step forward for a team brimming with talent and a tendency not to use it effectively.

Running Backs: C+

Strong bounce back performance from the Trojans. They improved where improvements were needed. We are going to need our A game every time we take the field to keep this season alive.
Next Game: USC vs. Washington

When I first watched Taylor Swift’s music video for “Wildest Dreams” during the 2015 VMAs, I didn’t think much of it. To me, it was just like all of her other music videos: visually stimulating and full of romance.  Critics such as Katherine Timpf of National Review, however, have been claiming that this music video not only depicts a heartbroken movie star, but actually glamorizes brutal white colonialism. 
In the video, Taylor Swift, playing a movie star from the 1950s named Marjorie Finn (in reference to Swift’s grandmother, Marjorie Finlay), falls in love with her co-star Robert Kingsley, played by Scott Eastwood. After a fight between the two of them on set (no surprise here), we are taken to a scene of the movie’s glamorous Hollywood premiere where Marjorie sees Robert with another woman. By the end of the video, Marjorie is seen running away from the premier in anguish.
Let’s be honest — there’s really no surprise here. This is the usual Taylor music video, full of emotion and betrayal. The argument for racism stems from a few facts about the music video itself. The video is set in Africa during the 1950s with a landscape full of lions, giraffes and a beautiful cascading waterfall. The problem is  there are very few black people in the cast of this fictitious movie being filmed in what some call a “colonial fantasy.”  I saw a few black extras, but finding them was even quite difficult. For anyone not really looking for them, it would have been like they did not even exist.
This was at most a microaggression, the everyday verbal and nonverbal insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate a derogatory message to target someone based on their minority status. Though I certainly understand why some would claim this video to be racist, I believe it neither glamorizes white colonialism nor promotes ideas of racism. 
Video director Joseph Kahn, stated to Entertain This!, “Wildest Dreams is a song about a relationship that was doomed, and the music video concept was that they were having a love affair on location away from their normal lives. This is not a video about colonialism but a love story on the set of a period film crew in Africa, 1950.” I think Kahn’s intention for this video wasn’t to offend anyone just as he said. It was an honest mistake, and it should be overlooked.
I want to be clear, however. This microaggression isn’t okay. Taylor Swift, as the mega superstar she is, should be more careful with the type of messages she disseminates through her videos. She, along with the producers, should have done more research on the past of white colonialism and been more careful with how they represented it. Microaggression after microaggression can have an insurmountable effect on society. 
Ultimately, there are many more important things than this video. For instance, the fact that modern-day colonialism actually still exists as depicted in the documentary We Come As Friends. Let’s have a conversation about that instead.

It’s that time of the semester again ­— midterm season. Most of you have already had one. If not, you will this coming week or some time soon.
When we are under stress the easiest thing to do is to buy junk food because a) you don’t need to cook it and b) we feel like we need to reward ourselves after so much studying/working on projects. But truth is, we’re really not rewarding our bodies, junk food does not give us the energy we need to keep studying, and we are just upsetting our stomachs. That thought inspired me, and I decided to give you guys a tip: weekly detox.
There are many ways to do this. You could make a smoothie detox, a fruit detox, lemonade detox or simply have a day when you eat super healthy.
Here is my version of a detox menu:
Breakfast
Fruit Parfait
Lunch
Chicken Tacos
Snack
Dinner
One-Pot Vegetable Enchilada
For the process, simply:
1) Add the first four ingredients on a pan and cook until the onion starts to brown.
2) Add the rest of the ingredients except the cheese and cook until tender.
(This should make about two portions)
Snack
If you’re still hungry, grab a few plain crackers (no sugar after 6 p.m.).
Quick Tip: Whenever you defrost something, don’t ever put it back in the freezer. What you defrost is what you should cook. That’s why making portions right after coming back from the groceries shop is so important.
Hope you liked these recipes, and remember to take your vitamins!

Two happy roommates enjoy game day. Alexa Edwards | Daily Trojan
Nothing can turn a year upside down like having a bad roommate. It’s stressful enough that you’re being pulled left and right between various activities, but now you have to put on a brave face and suppress your dissatisfaction with the person you live with every single day. Some people are able to turn the other cheek and live with it. For others, they just find any excuse possible to stay out of the room until bedtime. A bad roommate doesn’t have to ruin your year, however, and it’s easier than you think.
It’s difficult to understand how someone could be comfortable violating another person’s personal space. However, just know that it’s their space too and they’re going to treat it as such. In the event that your roommate’s stuff pours onto your side of the room, don’t dramatically maneuver around their things in front of them, or neglect to say anything until they notice. Instead, be direct and ask them politely to keep their things on their side of the room. It’s important to remember that most people do not pick up on social cues. All it takes is a simple explanation that you need barriers. There is a chance they may take offense initially, but if they’re seeking an easy living arrangement, they’ll respect it.
If you decide to choose a friend to live with whom you’ve never lived with before, recognize that there is a chance that just because you’re best friends does not mean you will be the best roommates. The best way for maintaining a solid relationship is seeing each other as both friends and roommates. When bringing up home-related issues, you are in roommate mode. Learning each other’s schedules or creating a schedule for the home to turn into a social pad will also prevent any surprise visits that may inconvenience the other person. Maintaining the level of respect within your established friendship shouldn’t change because you’re in closer quarters.
Finally, if you have a random roommate, you’re not obligated to be their friend, but you should definitely try. Having a random roommate can cause a person to walk into the situation expecting the worst, but random roommates turned friends are blessings in disguise. It’s especially great for late nights when it feels like the world is crashing down, and they’re right next to you through it all. But if you feel that you’re not going to be friends, just make sure the roommate agreement upholds itself. If everyone is keeps their word on chores, tasks and roommate agreements having a random roommate will be the least of your worries.
If you don’t feel a sense of relief when you go home, you’re looking at a long year of unnecessary additional stress. Practice open communication and be adamant about your boundaries, regardless of if your roommate is your friend. Also be sure to understand your roommate’s perspective before nitpicking everything they do. If you’re in USC housing and can’t find common ground with your roommate, talk to your residential advisor and see what your alternatives are. Your living experience may seem like it takes a backseat to everything else in life, but it’s where you’ll spend most of your time and you want to make sure that you feel comfortable in your own place.
