The Trojans started their game against Santa Clara on a 5-4 run. However, the scoreboard said that USC (2-0) trailed 6-5.

No, the scoreboard at the Galen Center was not broken. Rather, USC senior guard Donte Smith violated an obscure NCAA rule that forbids dunking in pregame warm-ups, giving Santa Clara guard Kevin Foster the chance to convert two free throws to give the Broncos (1-1) a 2-0 lead before the game even started.
“A technical foul before the game is unacceptable and cannot happen,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “But I thought our team reacted well to starting behind. I did not even know [Smith] could dunk to be honest.”
The Trojans were able to recover from their pregame deficit, shooting 57.4 percent from the field in the 86-73 win. USC scored 80 or more points in regulation only once last season.
“I am very pleased with the way that we controlled the tempo,” O’Neill said. “When we wanted to run, we ran, and when we could not run, we made the adjustment to do pick-and-rolls with [Maurice Jones].”
Freshman guard Maurice Jones and senior guard Marcus Simmons set the tone early for the Trojans, combining to score 15 of USC’s first 17 points before Simmons was substituted out after recording his second foul. Jones continued his aggressive play on offense, scoring a game-high 29 points in only his second collegiate game to go along with five assists.
“I want Maurice to stay aggressive. To put up those numbers is big time,” O’Neill said. “It is not a fluke that he makes these plays. He is impossible to guard one-on-one.”
Jones sparked a key stretch for the Trojans in the second half. With USC trailing 52-51, Jones scored six points during a 10-0 run that was punctuated by junior forward Nikola Vucevic stealing the ball and running the length of the court for a dunk.
“I was trying to make more plays, not even just me scoring but trying to get someone else an open layup or [jump] shot,” Jones said.
Vucevic had 22 points and 11 rebounds for the Trojans. Freshman guard Bryce Jones added 15 points.
Despite breaking a bone in his left hand on Saturday against UC Irvine, senior forward Alex Stepheson played the entire 40 minutes, making all three of his shots and grabbing seven rebounds.
“I could not do things with my left hand that I could normally do,” Stepheson said. “I tried to be aggressive, getting as many rebounds as I could, and if I could not get it, tip it to a teammate.”
Simmons and Smith each had four fouls with 15:33 remaining in the game, giving freshman forward Garrett Jackson an opportunity to see some action. Jackson played 14 minutes, scoring a basket and grabbing four rebounds.
Foster, Santa Clara’s dynamic scorer, led the Broncos with 26 points and four rebounds. Santa Clara forward Marc Trasolini added 15 points and nine rebounds.
The Trojans enter their third game of the season undefeated for only the second time in the past 10 seasons. Last year USC fell to Loyola Marymount 67-59 in their second game before starting the season 2-4.
USC’s next game is against Rider on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Galen Center as part of the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament.

A report released last week by the USC Rossier School of Education’s Center for Urban Education revealed key reasons for an education gap among Latino students pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and made recommendations for improvements, including USC’s role in the effort.
The report  was based on a three-year CUE study that examined Latino students who had obtained bachelor’s degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study highlighted the underrepresentation of Latino students in STEM fields most often because of the difference in funding for resources at universities. This is not to say that there is an achievement gap, said Alicia Dowd, associate professor of education and co-director of CUE, and one of three authors of the report.
“It can’t be an achievement gap if the opportunity is not there. This is an opportunity gap in our provision of education,” Dowd said. “The colleges and universities where most Latino students are enrolled have received less funding to provide STEM programs.”
The study compared students who had obtained associate’s degrees at community colleges and attended Hispanic-serving institutions with those who had not.
“What we’ve seen through our study is that among Latinos who do earn bachelors degrees [in STEM fields], very few are able to do so coming through community colleges,” Dowd said.
A Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, as defined by the U.S. Department of Education, is one whose enrollment of undergraduate full-time student is at least 25 percent Hispanic.
California currently has 81 Hispanic-serving institutions, the highest number in the United States.
According to the report, a significant way to increase representation and retention of Latino students in these fields is through increasing research opportunities at community colleges and HSIs.
“Traditionally underrepresented college students are the fastest growing group among our young population,” said Brian Prescott, director of policy research in the Policy Analysis and Research unit at the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, in a press release. “We want to make sure these students are given the support they need so they can complete their college goals.”
Dowd said one key pathway to reducing the opportunity gap is through the expansion of professional development.
In particular, this means further developing the environment in which faculty at both four-year colleges and community colleges come together to improve “curriculum alignment,” she said.
Focusing on making the curriculum of community colleges more similar to those of four-year colleges could help students become better prepared to advance in STEM fields, or if they transfer schools, Dowd said.
“That cannot happen without faculty knowing the kinds of teaching and content and instructional strategies taking place in other institutions,” she said.
Dowd said the report suggests USC could play a larger role in looking to community colleges as a source for obtaining a portion of their own future graduates as well as in collaborating with community college faculty to provide curricular resources.
“USC can partner with the HSIs [nearby] to become innovative [in producing] a culturally responsive pedagogy in STEM fields,” Dowd said.
Donna Harris, a senior majoring in public policy, planning and management, said she thinks exposing Latino students earlier on to fields such as math and engineering would help the numbers.
“I would suggest having Viterbi [and other STEM area schools] do community outreach to increase interest,” she said.
Not only do CUE’s findings address issues of social equity, but they also have tangible implications for the future of the nation’s workforce, according to the report.
Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and are projected to constitute 25 percent of the population in 2020.
“It’s important that Latino [students] be more exposed to [top-notch] fields like engineering and math if they are interested because we need to be thinking seriously about replacing baby boomers’ jobs,” Harris said.

A rally for K-12 students participating in this years’ QuikSCience Challenge, held on campus Thursday, motivated and informed attendees, organizers said.

“The purpose of the rally was for the students who have signed up for the QuikSCience Challenge to have an opportunity to come to USC and get excited about participating and to get ideas for their project,” said Lynn Whitley, the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies’ director of education and co-director of the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence-West.
Twenty-two USC graduate and undergraduate students mentor the younger students participating in the challenge, either through visits or talking on the phone or Skype, Whitley said.
“All of these kids had a good idea of the kinds of issues that are out there. Our role is to nurture that and help push them in the right direction — in terms of lesson plans or how to communicate with the general public about their issue,” said Jason Vo, a doctoral student studying biological sciences. “We really nurture what was already there.”
Teams of up to six students create projects on a scientific subject related to marine or freshwater environment. They choose an environmental issue and propose ideas for scientific students and creative solutions, then organize a community service project and create a lesson plan to teach their peers, all related to their scientific subject. High school teams also write a research proposal.
The volunteers also benefit from helping the students because the relationship develops their communication skills and because the younger students are enthusiastic, said Erica Seubert, a doctoral student studying biological sciences.
“You tend to go into it thinking that you’re doing this for them, but then you realize how rewarding it is to see some get as excited about science as you are,” Seubert said. “A lot of times it’s these ideas you’d never think of because you don’t think as wildly as a child does, so you end up learning a lot from them.”
Some of the mentor volunteers will also judge the projects when they are submitted in February, and gave the younger students tours of the labs at USC.
During the first part of the QuikSCience “SOS Rally — Surfing Onto Science,” the K-12 students rotated in four groups touring the exhibits, USC labs, campus and Natural History Museum. Several speakers spoke to the students about their organizations as potential ideas for their project.
Several organizations had booths at the event, including the Aquarium of the Pacific, Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation and COSEE, in addition to USC College Admissions, Whitley said.
“We had nice exhibits last year, and we had even more this year. We also had more interactive exhibits,” she said. “The students could hold and touch objects and organisms, and look at them through a microscope.”
Last year, more than 100 of the 300 participating students attended the rally. Coordinators said that space and funding resources cap the available space at 100 attendees but that the slots filled up more quickly this year, so they had to start a waiting list.
“I hope that it will help foster a new generation of scientists. A lot of times when you’re a young student, math and science can be a difficult subject. It helps to get some exposure to some of the things that you can do if you continue down those avenues,” Vo said. “When students come to campus and see what we do, then it encourages them to follow that path.”

A new research study from the USC Marshall School of Business suggests that attachment to certain brands or products might be much stronger than consumers think.
The study, based on surveys and real purchase data, determined that people form emotional bonds with popular brands such as Apple products, Quaker Oats Oatmeal and even local universities like USC. These bonds can be so strong that people can suffer separation anxiety if they are denied their favorite brands or products, according to the study.

Three USC faculty members — C. Whan Park, professor of marketing, Deborah MacInnis, vice dean of research and professor of business administration, and Joseph Priester, associate professor of marketing — conducted the study, which was recently published in the November issue of the Journal of Marketing.
Andreas Eisingerich, an assistant professor of marketing at the Imperial College Business School in London, and Dawn Iacobucci, a professor of marketing at Vanderbilt University, also contributed to the study.
One of the goals of this study was to address the differences between brand attachment and attitude strength and to analyze these in terms of behavioral outcomes, MacInnis said.
“We felt that brand attachment and attitude strength were fundamentally different concepts,” she said.
In order to test this hypothesis, the authors conducted a series of four different studies, which asked respondents to indicate their attachment to certain items such as Nike shoes, the Apple iPod and local universities.
The researchers found that, not only did people have strong attachments to certain brands, but they were also willing to exert extra effort to obtain these products.
“When people are highly attached to a particular product or service, they tend to go above and beyond the simple purchasing act,” Park said.
This could include spending more money on the product, paying less attention to competing brands, forgiving mistakes that the particular brand makes and defending the brand against negative input from other sources, he said.
Robyn Wolfish, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said her attachment to Apple products began after she bought an iPod.
“I felt compelled to get a MacBook to go with my Apple iPod,” she said, adding that she also plans on buying an iPhone when it comes out through Verizon Wireless. “It makes me feel trendy and ahead of the game.”
In addition, consumers’ attachment to brands was strikingly similar to their attachment to other people, the study said.
“People who are attached to other people suffer a great deal emotionally when a person dies or they end a relationship,” MacInnis said.
Relationships with specific brands or products are no different, she said.
Sam Trevino, a sophomore majoring in geology, said he thinks people get attached to brands if they feel a brand meets their specific needs.
“People like brands if they feel like their interests are somehow completely aligned with a brand name,” he said.
Though this study proves the strength of brand attachment, researchers said they are now trying to discover why this attachment forms and how they can use it as a marketing tool.
“The next step is to understand why people develop attachments,” MacInnis said. “What is their mechanism for being attached to some brands and not others?”
Park said he has determined three factors that are instrumental in creating strong attachments.
The brand, he said, needs to be entertaining, self-enabling and enriching.
“If a brand has only one of these three, attachment may not be strong,” Park said. “But if a brand possess more than one, or all three, we can expect attachment to get very strong.”
Park said he hopes to spend more time addressing the issue of creating and sustaining attachment.
“There will be many more interesting things to come,” he said.

Rod Gilfry always dreamed of being a fighter pilot. But at 6-foot-2, Gilfry was already too tall for a fighter jet cockpit. In the years since he gave up those plans at age 17, Gilfry has been nominated for two Grammy Awards and has acted and sung in 74 roles on prominent stages around the world, including Carnegie Hall in New York City.
Talk about a transition.
Although Gilfry’s early aspirations resided in a wholly unrelated field, he was always interested in music. Throughout high school, he tailored his résumé to apply for a music education major in college and completed his undergraduate work at Cal State Fullerton.
“While in high school, I tried to figure out what activity was most fulfilling and gave me the most pleasure,” Gilfry said. “It was vocal music.”
At Fullerton, Gilfry took voice lessons and developed his innate vocal talent through operas in the theater school. He performed at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, Calif., before coming to USC to study in its master’s program.
After graduating from the USC Thornton School of Music, Gilfry has enjoyed an exceedingly prolific career and was first brought to worldwide attention in the 1998 premiere of André Previn’s A Streetcar Named Desire at the San Francisco Opera.
Since his stunning debut, Gilfry has appeared as the title characters in Busoni’s Doktor Faust at the San Francisco Opera, Britten’s Billy Budd at shows in Geneva, Paris, London, Dallas and Los Angeles, and Mozart’s Don Giovanni, with shows in Los Angeles, Zürich, Lyon, London, Parma, Dallas, Minneapolis and Amsterdam, among many other illustrious roles.
More recently, Gilfry appeared as Emile de Becque in the U.S. National Tour of the Lincoln Center Production of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s South Pacific and as Captain von Trapp in the Théâtre du Châtelet production of The Sound of Music in Paris.
Between his tours onstage, Gilfry also acts as an assistant professor for Thornton’s vocal arts department.
Despite the current stability of Gilfry’s career, which allows him to explore music exclusively, his life is now one of transition and transformation.
Although his incredible theatrical run can be seen as an elevation from his initial goal of becoming a music teacher, it was still never part of the plan. Gilfry was recruited and trained to pursue the vocal arts as a performer, but it is not irrational to think that Gilfry would have been equally content as a music teacher. Why else does he return to Thornton whenever he gets the chance?
For a singer, the physical gift is essential, and the same can be said about many different skill sets, such as painting, mathematics or open-heart surgery. You need the painter’s eye, the mathematician’s brain or the surgeon’s steady hand to realistically follow the dream on a professional level.
What Gilfry argues is that we must embrace our deficiencies, because life fluctuates.
“One secret to happiness and fulfillment is to be flexible,” Gilfry said. “We should put all our energy and heart into pursuing what we want, but we need to be ready to embrace a change of course when it’s necessary.”
In other words, just because someone isn’t blessed with the vocal ability to have a solo singing career that shouldn’t mean that he had to give up on music. This is not the same as throwing in the towel or settling for less. We must all be aware that our dreams, no matter how specific, are malleable.
“Sing in a chorus, conduct a choir, work for an opera company, become a music educator,” Gilfry said. “If that’s not appealing, start an opera blog and retool to make a living.”
How many people can say that they are working in the exact environment that they envisioned for themselves as children? How many undergraduates can say they are approaching their careers in the way that they originally planned? How many of us have switched our majors?
When it comes to dreammaking, it is the core of that dream that matters most, not the details that we attach to it at various points in our life. The classic example of this is the man who aspires to sing at Carnegie Music Hall, so he disregards the community productions where he might have made some extraordinary connections and improved immensely as a performer.
Then there is the woman who is set on becoming an anchor on ESPN and completely neglects FOX Sports Net on the road to her idea of perfection.
Gilfry sings all over the world just to keep singing.
And if we are truly passionate about something, shouldn’t we be able to find enjoyment in every crevice and corner of a career?
If we can just do that, we will never truly fail.
Brian Ivie is a sophomore majoring in cinema-television critical studies. His column, “Dreammaking,” runs Tuesdays.

Curly gray hair, round glasses, black dress clothes and no smile. That is the first impression of pianist Daniel Pollack as he walked under the spotlight in Bovard Auditorium on Sunday. He touched the Steinway piano on the center of the stage and the music began.
Photo by Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan
Visions and Voices brought Thornton School of Music professor Pollack onstage in celebration of the anniversary of the births of composers Frédéric Chopin and Samuel Barber, 200 and 100 years ago, respectively.
Before the concert began, Thorton professor of musicology Tim Page gave an introduction to the music on the program, praising it as “highly virtuosic,” bursting with “heart, depth and passion.” He brought out Pollack, who performed solo for the evening.
One of the things that stuck from Page’s introduction was his emphasis on the idea that the piano was much more than just an instrument — a piano has a singing quality, a piano has deep intelligence, a piano has musicality.
Pollack was a child prodigy, beginning his piano performance career at the age of nine when he debuted at the New York Philharmonic, one of the most difficult orchestras to perform with; to quote Page, it is an orchestra that “eats conductors alive.”
Daniel Page continued his studies at Juilliard and went on to participate in many competitions, quickly carving a name as one of the great American contemporary pianists.
He became one of the leading American pianists to explore the music of Russia during Cold War, a time when relations with nations beyond the iron curtain were scarce.
Pollack began the concert with the Organ Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by J.S. Bach, a prominent piece of organ music that has been featured extensively in today’s pop culture including video games, rock music — even Countdown with Keith Olbermann.
Like many baroque pieces, the voicing is an arduous work of inter-related melodies and overlapping harmonies. Pollack showed a masterful understanding of the piece’s nuances and brought out each layer, allowing for the piece to essentially sing itself to the audience.
The program continued with two Chopin Etudes (Op. 10 No. 11 and Op. 25 No. 8), a Chopin Nocturne (D-Flat Major Op. 27 No. 2) and the Chopin Sonata No. 3 in B Minor (Op. 58). Pollack captured the almost flippant air of the first Etudes yet still maintained the emotion behind them.
All the while, his brow was furrowed in concentration, eyes pouring over his rapid-fire hands and still no visible smile. His technique was awe-inspiring; he played so smoothly, as if it was effortless, almost natural to do so.
The Nocturne in D-Flat Major was just as Page described it earlier: haunting and melancholy. Pollack’s steady left hand was constantly accompanying the beautiful melody throughout the piece, inspiring feelings of softness and comfort.
The Chopin Sonata was incredible to hear — because of Pollack’s interpretation as well as the composition in and of itself. Pollack’s pedaling throughout the repertoire was fantastic, holding the notes and sounds over without muddling them. The Chopin work did not lack life in the least.
Next, Pollack played three Debussy pieces, “Reflets dans l’eau” (Reflections in water), “Voiles” (Veils) and “Feux d’artifice” (Fireworks) — all of which were wonderful impressionist pieces to start off the second half of the concert.
The pianist made the notes simply float, giving the segment an effervescent touch. These pieces worked well, serving as a transition from the Romantic Chopin to the thoroughly modern Barber.
At times, it seems as if many people underestimate Barber.
A great American composer, his music seemed to straddle the fine line between harmonious sound and cacophony. Still, after the clearly glorious sounds of Chopin and Debussy, Barber sounded off.
However, once Pollack finished the Barber Sonata with a flourish, it was clear that there was more to the piece than it might seem at first. Pollack once again showed a talent for taking songs that, on the surface, might seem staid or boring and bringing out their hidden depths.
It was also clear that the audience was enjoying the show, so much so that more than half of the auditorium stood up and applauded.
The best part of the performance was Pollack’s encore: Chopin’s Nocturne Opus Posthumous, which he dedicated in honor of his mother, without whom he would not have been where he is now.
It was one of the most tragic songs of the night, with the heavy use of C Minor tugging at the audience’s heartstrings.
At the end of the night, it was clear that Chopin and Barber’s musical legacies endure. Pollack showcased not only his talent, but the skilled music writing of the night’s honorees.
In the end, the concert was just what it was advertised as — an evening of exquisite music performed by a talented pianist.

Offer someone a camera and they will probably hold it at eye level with both hands, taking care to line everything up perfectly. Most people think photos require a logical symmetry. However, lomographists subscribe to a different philosophy. The 10th golden rule of Lomography is, “Don’t worry about any rules.”
Lomography is a freestyle form of photography where anything goes. Typically, photographers use cameras such as the Diana F+, the Holga and the Fisheye, because they’re user-friendly and their low-cost designs produce unique shots.

Patrons of the Los Angeles Lomography Gallery Store know this to be a proven fact, and on Sunday night they gathered to attend the closing party for the Diana World Tour in celebration of the Diana camera.
Last February, the branch in Los Angeles opened its doors as the second Lomography store in the United States, and since then it has become the largest Lomography store in the world.
The style originated in the underground scene of Vienna, and has since inspired an international community of both artists and amateurs alike. Ten Golden Rules of Lomography do exist, but instead of constraining photographers, they serve to release Lomographers from the camera’s restriction, encouraging experimentation and shooting from the hip.
For the past month, the L.A. Lomography Gallery Store has hosted the Diana World Tour as well as the photo exhibition, “Vignettes from the City of Angels and the Custom Clones Collection.”
The tour started in Hong Kong in 2008 and has since traveled around the world, visiting cities such as New York, Lisbon, Paris and Berlin. Lindsay Hutchens, the gallery’s assistant manager, said the tour’s last residence was in Riga, Latvia and its next destination will be Sydney.
The main attraction is the Dietrich Collection, an assortment of more than 100 vintage Diana cameras from the 1950s-60s. Curated by Allan Dietrich, the collection showcases a visual history of the quintessential vintage camera — the Diana produces the kind of photos one would expect to find buried in an old family album.
The Diana’s plastic lens creates a soft focus, and coupled with its trademark saturation, an authentically old-school aesthetic is achieved. The rising popularity of 35mm film and instant cameras led to a decrease in the use of Dianas during the mid-1970s.
Fortunately, the Austrian company Lomographische AG revived the unique camera and incorporated them into the lomography scene.
Hutchens was quick to point out the dedication needed for analog cameras like the Diana.
“There are things you come to rely on and take for granted with digital cameras, whereas one like the Diana requires manual control and more experimentation,” she said.
The gallery itself was humming with artistic fervor, exemplified by the massive collage called the “LomoWall,” made of handpicked photos displaying Los Angeles through the eyes of the store’s “Lomo Amigos,” as the patrons and contributors call themselves.
Every table was covered with variously colored Diana specimens, some with bulky flash attachments and others pocket-sized for the impulsive photographer. The gallery had a retro atmosphere one would expect to find in a 1960s nightclub, vibrant yet simple and sophisticated.
As everyone discussed their favorite camera filters, DJ Jack Hughes played an eclectic mix of Bossa Nova, brassy jazz and a beat-infused Russian ballet. The Dietrich Collection was a blast from the past, since many of the film-spewing dinosaurs still had their original packaging. These cameras possessed a classic style, as if they were used to capture the smile of an Old Hollywood celebrity strutting across the red carpet.
Manager Michelle McIlroy said the intent of the L.A. gallery is to provide a “one stop shop for everything photography and Lomography.”
But McIlroy emphasized that the gallery was not meant to be strictly a retail venue.
“[The store is meant to be] a place where the local community can meet and share their passion,” she said.
Further reflecting this sense of community, photography workshops are offered weekly, as well as neighborhood LomoJourneys that include a rented camera and the chance to capture L.A. by film.
Another way the gallery stays connected to its supporters is through the tour’s charity-based “Vignettes from the City of Angels and the Custom Clones Collection.” A silent auction was held for each piece of the collection, with proceeds going to a charity of the artist’s choice.
Avid Lomo Amigos could submit vignettes expressing the way they view their city, making for an excellent showcase of the Diana’s trademark appeal.
In addition, famous Lomo Amigos such as Seth Rogen and Amanda Palmer sent in various Diana clones. Each clone was altered to become an extension of the artist; the Viper Room transformed its Diana into a musician’s microphone while other cameras became robots or were splashed in neon paint.
“Local artists were given carte blanche to do whatever they want,” Hutchens said.
That attitude expertly sums up the Diana camera and its vintage charm. Lomography allows people to express themselves without rules, using a medium that’s both unfiltered and conducive to the individual’s personality.
Most importantly, remember the motto of every Diana and its Lomographic cousins: “Don’t think, just shoot.”

It’s no secret that the University of California school system is struggling financially. The impact of the recession on education has been so thoroughly canvassed that “UC” and “budget cuts” go conversationally hand-in-hand. In the latest turn of events, UC regents are voting on whether or not undergraduate fees should be raised 8 percent.
To counter the educational belt-tightening, UC schools everywhere, including those that are located in international offices or online, are now focusing their energies on enrolling a higher percentage of out-of-state students.
This is an unprecedented move — one that has left many prospective in-state students with the sense that their own renowned educational system has abandoned them.
The decision is not completely unjustified. Out-of-state students bring in sizeable commissions that enable schools to keep key courses open and help students graduate on time. At UC Berkeley, for example, out-of-state students pay on average $11,439.50 more per semester than do in-state students.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that in-state applicants are being reviewed more critically than are out-of-staters. Many UC schools are insisting that they will be able to boost their number of out-of-state students without cutting the number of local applicants they accept.
Even if that proves true, this initiative still means that the concentration of recruiting resources and UC representatives will lie outside California. In-state applicants are bound to suffer in some way from a system that is not focused on encouraging them to enroll.
We haven’t yet found the solution to affordable education. But there are no long-term advantages to the prioritization of out-of-state students. It’s merely a quick-fix. And it’s unfortunate that when selecting a quick-fix, the UC school system chose one that neglects its local students in favor of raising a few extra dollars.
Ultimately, the public education system is there to serve the students, regardless of where they hail from. The solution to funding problems that affect those students should be one that considers them all equally.
As a native Californian I think it is time to end in-state tuition. The value, diversity, means that we need to treat all applicants to our schools equally. To subsidize, with tax dollars, one student over another because of where they live is quaint. 
If the UC system is so great, then there is no price too high to pay for admission. Look at the prices that parents will pay to get their children out of bad schools. Observe the long lines parents stand in and waiting lists they places their children on for charter schools and scholarships for primary education. 
Either the UC schools offer value for the money or they don’t; in which case the taxpayers should not pay for low quality.
I agree, why give a s—, why should we care if UCs go bankrupt and/or go down the rankings?
Owwwwhhh, how’s that song go? “We are the wooorld, we are the chil…” 
If SC turns soft and left, I will not give another godammn dime in donations! The “prestige” and recent surpassing of Westwood Progressive Left aka ucla was heavily contigent on donations; research the criteria for why a university rises in ranks.  
The contemporaneous students here, at exorbitant, University of Senses Coddled drank a little too much Kool Aid. Should SC go back to “right & white, Nixon-Republican” stupid? I’d rather act on what works, than give a _ _ _ _ about what Socialists claim is right for society. 
Why do you want to empower that cesspool aka the UC system? Which side are you on boy/girl? Where’s the killer instinct?
SC is going down the drain…truth.
What does that comment even mean?
“I could give a…” you’re a moron.  Hope you’re not an alumnus.  I’d be embarrassed to have you in the family.
Sure boy, whatevers! The UC system fell on its face because its administration was and still is myopic. They’re negligent, corrupt, and finally, their hands were caught on the cookie jar. If you’re a CA taxpayer, or mommy and daddy are, you’re gonna pay for their fiasco.The faculty there demand higher-than-average annual salary for jobs they don’t do; it’s analogous to government work. The professors at the UC systems don’t teach; they let the TAs do all the legwork, and supposedly delve into esoteric research, “UCLA researchers discover that fast food contributes to obesity” LOL!

We’ve been hearing a lot about solar energy lately. It’s a pleasant-sounding concept, one that gives us warm eco-fuzzies akin to the ones we’d get hearing about organic vegetables or an army of sixth-graders hosing down a beached whale. But though it’s growing in popularity, solar energy is not yet something we see implemented day to day.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
The reality is that for a significant number of Los Angeles residents and businesses, installing solar paneling is only feasible through the provision of incentives, usually in the form of tax or electric bill rebates.
The driving concept behind incentives is that by encouraging people to spend more than they originally would on key goods and services, society as a whole will benefit. By investing in costly alternative technology rather than what is cheaper and conventional, these consumers are giving the economy — not just themselves — a leg up. Therefore, they deserve a tax break, refund, deduction — you get the idea.
With solar energy, for instance, such subsidies are often signed over to the company performing the installation, which means that they can collect the rebates on the consumer’s behalf, reducing his out-of-pocket expense from the get-go — thus, affordability.
On Nov. 12, the Los Angeles City Council did us all a favor in throwing the brakes on a motion that might cripple that affordability.
The Board of Commissioners of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power voted earlier this month to slash regional solar incentives. The City Council responded by motioning for a new charter rule, appropriately titled “City Council Veto of Board Actions,” allowing it specifically to overturn rulings by fellow city boards — including the DWP — so that the issue can be further explored before drastic steps are taken.
In terms of playing up the advantages of red tape, this would be the LADWP equivalent of the 1935 filibuster in which Sen. Huey Long held up a provision for 15 and half hours by reciting a combination of Shakespeare and exotic seafood recipes. All the same, it was necessary.
The Board of Commissioners wasn’t about to slash incentives because there wasn’t enough demand. They were going to do it because there was too much. Solar energy programs in Los Angeles have actually been running out of funding because too many people now want in on them for the suppliers to keep up, and therein lies the rub.
Now that demand for incentives exceeds supply, does their success mean we no longer need them? Or does their success mean we need them more? Essentially, we now need to ascertain whether we have reached the level of critical mass at which people will invest in solar energy without them, or if the demand will vanish when the incentives do.
The City Council got it right, at least for now. Solar energy is at the forefront of political discussion more than ever in California, but it’s not in the mainstream — the L.A. smog belying our heavy dependence on petroleum is proof enough of that. And with an economy still fighting to ditch its post-recession training wheels, perceived luxuries such as alternative energy take a backseat to air conditioning and rent.
It’s hard to be optimistic about the number of working-class Angelenos who would prioritize such abstracts as solar paneling for less reason than they were given before, at a time when they have less money than they were earning before. If the incentives suffer, it’s likely demand would too.
It smacks of vague and unsatisfying politicking to say that if we just keep incentives around for “X” amount years, they’ll pay for themselves down the road. But in a big-picture sense, incentives are already benefiting the economy if we consider cost externalities.
Take gas, for example — a $3 per gallon pricetag covers the cost of extracting, refining and transporting but does not reflect the economic cost of the Gulf oil spill or any healthcare expenses associated with constant exposure to pollution. In short, what we don’t pay at the pump, we pay in other bills.
In this context, expenditures such as solar energy are infinitely more profitable than they appear on paper. But again, it’s hard to convince people that alternative energy is a necessary expense while California simultaneously boasts an unemployment rate more than 12 percent.
Solar energy as it stands now is, from a purely financial standpoint, far too costly to be worth the hassle. Without incentives, there’s not enough demand to justify the high cost of production, distribution and installation of such an obscure commodity.
But persist with the incentives for that “X” amount of years and more people will be persuaded to convert to solar, the increased demand will lead to cheaper mass production, a greater supply of solar energy will be harnessed and boom — a self-perpetuating, economical domino effect.

College admissions officers have been seeing a rise in the Common Application this year, an internet portal that is used to streamline applications to over 400 colleges and universities in one online form.
Approximately 600,000 students from across the United States will use the Common Application this year.
It is becoming so popular that college applicants often express frustration or annoyance if a particular school is not on the list.
Stanford, Pomona College and Loyola Marymount University all participate in the College Application system, although University of California and California State schools have chosen not to join.
UC spokesman Richard Vazquez said that because these schools require so much supplemental information on their applications, it would not be in the students’ best interest to join the program.
USC, however, is thinking about being added to the list for next year’s admissions process.
“We’ve gotten a lot of feedback from high school counselors and prospective students who would really like us to go to the Common Application,” Timothy Brunold, USC admissions dean, said to the Los Angeles Times.
“I think we’ve heard that enough that it is time to think about it in earnest,” he said.

As if it weren’t enough to completely change the internet world and lend a story to a chart-topping movie that has called the definition of an entire generation, Facebook has it’s minds set on something else.
E-mail.
The social networking sensation will now turn into the go-to for all forms of internet messaging, including e-mail. Creator Mark Zuckerberg revealed the plans on Monday for what is known as “Project Titan.” Though some media outlets present it as threatening to Gmail, Zuckerberg denies the claim.
What is certain is that apart from all the other stylistic changes that recently hit Facebook, this one may have a more rippling effect on the internet world.
Here’s to a new internet generation.

The pest, which has already caused major and irreparable damage in Asia and across the Mediterranean, was found when a tree trimmer cut off a dying Canary Island date palm in the Long Beach area.
After further investigation, another red palm weevil was discovered about 500 yards away from the initial one.
The insect, which is about 1.5 inches in length, can kill a tree from the inside out. The red palm weevil infests a tree by laying eggs in the crown, where the emerging leaves feed the larvae.
This type of infestation is different from others because it damages new leaves as opposed to eating away old ones.
While it takes up to a year or two for the weevil to kill a tree, early detection is necessary for a tree to survive after an infestation.

USC used a 18-rebound advantage to defeat UC Irvine, 62-49, in the Trojans’ regular season opener on Saturday.

“The first win is always the hardest one,” junior forward Nikola Vucevic said. “We have to adjust to each other because this is a new team, but I think we did a pretty good job, even though we had some bad plays.”
After the game was tied at 11 midway through the first half, freshman guard Bryce Jones scored seven consecutive points to give USC (1-0) an 18-11 advantage. The scoring streak gave Jones a total of 12 points, meaning that he had single-handedly outscored the Anteaters (0-2) more than 12 minutes into the game. Jones finished his first official collegiate game with 14 points.
In the second half, the Anteaters came within six points of the lead with as late as 7:07 left in the game, but the Trojans then went on a 7-0 run to put the game out of reach. Vucevic was key to USC’s second-half play, scoring 17 of his 19 points in the second half for the Trojans.
The Anteaters could not match up with the height of the Trojans. USC had 44 rebounds compared to 26 for UC Irvine, including 11 more offensive rebounds than the Anteaters. Vucevic led the Trojans with 14 rebounds, while senior forward Alex Stepheson grabbed 13 rebounds and Jones added eight.
Forward Pavol Losonsky paced UC Irvine with 13 points and eight rebounds. Forward Eric Wise added 12 points and five rebounds.
Despite the win, depth proved to be an issue for the Trojans. With sophomore forward Evan Smith sidelined because of a shoulder injury, USC coach Kevin O’Neill only played six players more than 30 minutes. Freshman guard Maurice Jones, Stepheson and Vucevic each played 37 or more minutes.
“We obviously do not have a lot of depth right now,” O’Neill said. “It is imperative that our guys stay out of foul trouble and give themselves a chance to play the whole game.”
Maurice Jones played all 40 minutes in his first official collegiate game. Despite feeling “a little bit” tired after the game, he played well, accumulating 13 points and four assists.
“I felt pretty comfortable after going up and down [the court] a few times,” Maurice Jones said. “[Coach] wants me to make some plays so that we can get some easy buckets and not always have to run a set [play].”
The Trojans host Santa Clara tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center. The Broncos (1-0) are led by guard Kevin Foster, who as a freshman in 2008-2009 averaged 14.7 points per game and was named the West Coast Conference Co-Newcomer of the Year as well as a Freshman All-American. He redshirted last season after suffering a foot injury early in the year, but is healthy now. Foster scored a team-high 19 points in the Broncos’ first game this season, an 82-77 victory over Cal State Bakersfield.

Chants, shouting and the sound of a 20-year-old record breaking could be heard coming from McDonald’s Swim Stadium last weekend as the men and women’s swim and dive teams hosted the Arizona Wildcats and Arizona State Sun Devils in two dual meets.
The No. 6 Women of Troy defeated the No. 7 Wildcats on Friday, 190-110, and continued to dominate by defeating Arizona State on Saturday as well, 172-121. Meanwhile, No. 5 Arizona defeated the men’s team on Friday, 190-110, but the No. 14 Trojans came back and conquered Arizona State the next day, 186-107.
One of USC’s most memorable moments this weekend came in the form of freshman Vladimir Morozov. The newcomer broke a USC record on Saturday with his 100-yard freestyle time of 42.93 seconds. Erik Ran previously set the record in 1990 with a time of 42.98.
“I felt great. I didn’t even think of breaking [the record],” Morozov said. “I thought I was going about half a second slower, but it was great.”
Morozov’s record, which was set in the men’s 400-yard freestyle relay on Saturday, was not the only thing that made USC coach Dave Salo proud this weekend.
“I think we demonstrated clearly that we have a really strong program and hopefully in March we’ll be able to make it to the top five [at the Pac-10 championships],” Salo said. “We’ve really come a long way in the last three years. We’re now a team that’s probably more respected and I think people expect more out of us.”
With the Women of Troy’s sweep this weekend, and the Trojans’ victory against Arizona State, the dual meets proved to be successful ones for USC. There were several factors going against the Trojans, but they didn’t rattle USC swimmers.
“We did great and we fought on to the end,” Morozov said. “We got beat by Arizona but they were rested and they were wearing their suits, so that made a lot of difference … [On Friday] in the morning we had a full workout before our meet, so when we are rested and put into fast suits we will do better at everything. “
Another foreseen challenge was the fact that the Friday’s dual meet against Arizona took place in the evening, a rare occurrence for the swimmers. The USC teams found the conditions to be advantageous, however, and the Women of Troy even managed to come out with a victory.
“I think that we can swim faster later in the day,” junior Katinka Hosszu said. “It’s easier to get really pumped up at night with the lights on and everything.”
After this weekend, USC’s swimmers have a while to wait before their next competition. They will compete again at the U.S. National Championships in December, with the NCAA and Pac-10 championships on the horizon after that. With their last meets done for a while, both teams are ready to see what happens next.
“I am really excited because we are already swimming at almost our best times now and we are not even rested,” Hosszu said. “I am curious to see how we do when we are rested and have our suits on.”

The No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team got a little bit of revenge and a whole lot of momentum at the Galen Center over the weekend.
With back to back home wins over No. 20 Arizona and Arizona State — one of just four teams to beat the Women of Troy earlier this year — USC improves to 22-4 on the season and 11-4 in conference, heading into the final three games of the regular season.
“We just want to make sure we finish well in the Pac-10,” senior outside hitter Geena Urango said. “Hopefully that carries over to the NCAA tournament.”
USC came out ready for a physical match on Saturday, outblocking Arizona 15-1 and frustrating the Wildcat’s offense the entire night. Middle blockers junior Lauren Williams, freshman Alexis Olgard and sophomore Natasa Siljkovic put up a wall for USC early and rejected Arizona eight times in the first set as the Women of Troy rushed out to a 25-14 lead. Williams opened the second period with a 16-4 run, capitalizing on Arizona hitting errors and poor returns, and Siljkovic buried the set with two kills that gave USC a 2-0 lead at intermission.
The Wildcats showed some teeth in the third set, staying within three points at 21-18, but Siljkovic’s final kill put the Wildcats away and closed out the sweep.
“Natasa is playing great right now,” junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter said. “Now that she’s healthy, every time she comes in she really fires up the team.”
The 6-foot-3 sophomore led by example, finishing with a season-high four kills and four blocks. Jupiter also did her part firing the Women of Troy up, leading with 16 kills and five blocks. After the game, the players were already talking about Sunday’s rematch with the Sun Devils.
“We have to redeem ourselves,” Urango said. “Last time we played them, we weren’t focused. We need to come out focused.”
Focusing might have been difficult for three USC seniors who played their final game at the Galen Center in an emotional end to the weekend. Urango, middle blocker Zoe Garrett and outside hitter Kimmee Roleder were all honored alongside their families directly before the match as part of Senior Night.
“I don’t think there’s another two people I’d rather share this with,” Roleder said after the match. “I’m just so excited I got to share this with them and we get to finish out the season together.”
The night was particularly special for Garrett, who got the nod from USC coach Mick Haley to start against the Sun Devils. Garrett posted five kills and four blocks with no errors in her final home game in the USC uniform, helping lift the Women of Troy past Arizona State in four sets.
“I think we played really strong. That was a good performance for us and a good step up,” Jupiter said. “We’re going to have to try to do that consistently now.”
The Women of Troy round out regular season play with matches at Oregon State, Oregon and UCLA, beginning with the Beavers in Corvallis, Ore., on Friday.
