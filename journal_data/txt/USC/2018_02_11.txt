On a Wednesday evening at the end of January, as he is on most Wednesday evenings, Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn was hunched over a laptop in TCC 241 — the epicenter of USC student governance. That night, Dunn finds himself nearly alone there, a campus leader toiling away beneath a cloud of unease. 
Most student leaders were at the first USG presidential debate, listening to the two aspiring presidential and vice presidential candidates debate the University’s most pressing issues. Two buildings away was Dunn, who has become an outsider in an organization in which he was elected as very much an insider.
But in recent months, starting with the publication of a New Yorker piece in late December, Dunn has been at the focus of swirling allegations about possible ties to a conservative nonprofit called Turning Point USA.
In the article, the organization was accused of meddling in student elections with the aim of laying down conservative ideology on national campuses often painted blue. The article mentions a donor-aimed brochure, titled “The Campus Victory Project,” highlighting universities where the organization claims it helped student leaders get elected. 
“Once in control of student governments,” the brochure says, “Turning Point expects its allied campus leaders to follow a set political agenda,” including putting in place greater protections to free speech and pulling funding from liberal-leaning groups, the article says. 
Mobile screenshots referred to in the piece show one field director sending a TPUSA employee a racially offensive text message about black people. 
Association with the organization has also caused turmoil at other national universities. As reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education, elected student officials at the University of Maryland and Ohio State had to step down due to involvement with the Turning Point organization that violated their schools’ campaign finance laws. 
And joining the ranks of the more than 54 universities the Turning Point brochure claims to have benefited from Turning Point’s election network is the University of Southern California. 
In fact, more than just USC. In documents from the brochure reviewed by the Daily Trojan, Dunn’s name was listed specifically. 
THE BEGINNING
In a quiet conference room in the back of the USG office, Dunn addressed the Turning Point allegations. He said that his involvement has been misconstrued, that when they contacted him he said candidates could “get support through social media,” but that he never accepted money from them. 
“Other than [social media], that’s not really welcomed here,” Dunn said he told TPUSA staff.
He said he attended two of their conferences, but only to meet with other student leaders, unaware until the publication of the New Yorker article about the allegations that had been brought forth against the organization. No campaign sanctions were ever brought against Dunn, nor are endorsements from outside organizations deemed illegal by the Elections Code.
“I just remember reading it, and being like, ‘holy crap, holy crap, holy crap,’ looking through the article and at the end, it was like, ‘whoa, why are there random schools listed here’ and ‘why is my school listed here?’” Dunn said.
According to Dunn, his contact with TPUSA began in the spring of 2016, when he was campaigning on his first major USG ticket as the vice presidential running mate for then-presidential candidate Edwin Saucedo. 
Saucedo said he had no knowledge that Turning Point had reached out to Dunn. 
In the Turning Point at USC Facebook group run in part by TPUSA staff members, interactions between Turning Point staff and Dunn indicate that TPUSA was involved in social media campaigning for Dunn during his first major USC election for vice president in 2016. 
A post from a Turning Point regional director at the time urged those in the group to change their profile pictures to support the Edwin & Austin ticket — consisting of Dunn and Saucedo, who would go on to be elected. Saucedo has since graduated.
“We really want these guys to win,” the post read.  Dunn was tagged in the post but Saucedo was not.
Saucedo claims he did not become aware of what Turning Point was until after the publication of the New Yorker piece and had no knowledge of any social media efforts between Dunn and TPUSA during the election.
“I was surprised they said they had endorsed us because I had never sought out their endorsement,” Saucedo said.
Aside from the social media involvement, once elected as president in 2017, Dunn said he attended two conferences with Turning Point, of which the Daily Trojan acquired a roommate list from one in June that confirmed his attendance. 
On the website, the conference, titled “Road to Majority,” said that it selected 200-plus students to attend and gave the selected students the opportunity “to hear from a variety of accomplished speakers and leaders in the conservative movement, acquire new activism and leadership skills, connect with like-minded organizations and network with other young professionals from across the country.” TPUSA said it covered the costs of hotel accommodations and admission. 
The speakers lists of the two conferences Dunn attended read like a who’s-who of conservative politics, with both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence listed as keynote speakers at the conference in June, alongside rising conservative media personalities Ben Shapiro and Tomi Lahren. Shapiro has recently made headlines for causing eruptions of student protests earlier this year at UC Berkeley where he was scheduled to speak. 
Dunn said nothing during his time at the conferences struck him as a “red flag” regarding the organization. He said he was “never really interested” in the speakers, but rather attended for the workshopping and networking opportunities with other student leaders. Though he said he was aware of the organization’s conservatism, he said it is common for conferences of this nature to have political leanings and this was not something that struck him as unusual. 
 “All I really focused on was what I could get out of it for student government, and it was just focused on [how] these other student leaders are here, and we can put our heads together and the fruitful discussions that were coming out of that were really where my focus was at,” Dunn said.
Rachel Udabe, a senior who ran against Dunn for USG president last year and received the second-most votes, said that though it would have been nice for candidates to divulge any possible partisan ties they maintained, it’s not something she would expect.
“There were other things that were hidden from the student body in how they were running their campaign, so I wouldn’t expect them to be forthright about it,” Udabe said.
Udabe’s comments refer to a 48-hour social media ban handed down by the Elections Commission to Dunn’s 2017 presidential campaign after the commission found that their ticket had violated election rules by launching social media campaigning before the designated period had begun. 
Udabe said that she and her running mate were focused on running a campaign based on their platform, so knowledge of any prior association between Dunn and Turning Point would not have impacted her campaign strategy. She also said she believes that if there were an affiliation between Dunn and Turning Point, either during the campaign in which she was a part of or the one prior, it would not have impacted much, because the Elections Code safeguards against external donations. 
Dunn said that never along the course of the campaign did he take money. Because of the way the Elections Code is set up, in which all students must apply for campaign reimbursements, it would not make sense for them to donate, Dunn said. It’s also explicitly prohibited in the Elections Code. 
Dunn said he was unaware Turning Point was using his name in its marketing materials, and that he gave “zero consent” for them to do so. He said he is non-political and feels that his ties to the organization have painted him as being more partisan than he actually is. He also said he would tell future USG presidents to tread lightly in their interactions with outside organizations. 
“So, it has probably — not probably — it has without a doubt been the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through in my life,” Dunn said. “Just in this job, it’s been very difficult, I would say, to be tied to things without approval, and then kind of be looked at in a certain light, when that’s not really who I am or what I stand for.”
Turning Point USA did not respond to repeated requests for comment about its affiliation with USC student government.
THE GRAY AREA
As for the USG Elections Code, the rules regarding endorsements are murky.
The code tackles endorsements in articles XI.A and XI.B. There, the code states the protocol for student organizations endorsing USG candidates — saying they “may be endorsed by any recognized student organization as defined by the Office of Campus Activities or Office for Residential and Greek Life.”
“[Outside endorsements] don’t exist,” said Emily Lee, a former USG Elections Director and the author of the 2017-2018 Elections Code. “Maybe they exist on the internet but they’re never going to be listed and recognized as official endorsements.”
In terms of external donations, Election Code  article X.M.​ states, “Candidates may not accept or offer any monetary contributions in exchange for personal or political gain during any point in the Elections period. Services provided free of charge must be declared, and are subject to examination by the Elections Auditor.”
But these two codes are the closest the Elections Code gets to confronting a case of potential third-party interference in elections. And here, according to Dunn, lies the problem. 
“There are no regulations on what we can and cannot do, and it’s really hard because, being in an elected position, you’re obviously a representative of the University; there’s times when you’re like, ‘I just want to represent myself,’” Dunn said. “But you can’t just take that hat on and off.”
Dunn stated that it’s not always clear through the bylaws what is allowed and what is not. He even advocated for stricter policies about candidates and partisan ties. 
“Recognized student orgs are [the] only ones allowed to endorse campaigns, and only if they have taken the appropriate measures as required by the code,” USG Communications Director Daniel Zhu said in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan last week.
But the Elections Code never explicitly bars candidates from either seeking or receiving an endorsement from outside organizations. 
Once USG officials take office, there exists greater ambiguity in whether candidates’ affiliations with special interest groups violate USG rules. 
Lee said the Elections team or a third party could bring forth allegations of potentially illegal involvement between a USG candidate and a special interest group. 
However, with regard to post-elections investigations, Lee said: “Well that’s something that we have the press for, right?”
THE INVISIBLE HAND
Turning Point USA was founded in 2012 by Charlie Kirk. Kirk, now 25, describes himself in his book Time for a Turning Point: Setting a Course Toward Free Markets and Limited Government as “just a 22-year-old who loves individual freedom.” 
He is a regular contributor on Fox News, spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and was featured on the 2018 Forbes list “30 Under 30.” In his book, he says he created Turning Point to promote free market values and the benefits of small government to younger generations. He also discusses using social media to engage younger audiences in his brand of conservatism. 
Kirk mentions student governments as a particularly apt means of spreading the conservative message. 
In essence, the process Kirk describes is that Turning Point staff finds students they think may be receptive to their messaging and propose ideas that adhere to their ideology — he describes this in terms of Adam Smith’s “Invisible Hand.”
For example, Kirk took partial credit for the initiative to bring free Uber service to USC — which came January 2015, as part of a collaboration between the USG University Affairs committee and USC Transportation. He said it was done in part “with the help of Turning Point USA activists.” 
Dunn, who served as a part of the committee, said that the assertion was “not even close to relevant or factual.”
Turning Point USA’s efforts also extend to that of normal student organizations. TPUSA chapters exist on multiple campuses across the United States, including USC. 
Xena Amirani, the president of the USC Turning Point chapter, said that the group had existed at USC in the past, but fizzled out until she restarted it last year. She said she came across a table on Trousdale Parkway with TPUSA staff members who helped her restart the chapter on USC’s campus. In fact, she said that she had been recruited to join Turning Point before she had even started at USC.
Amirani’s retelling of her introduction to Turning Point aligns almost verbatim with Kirk’s book, which states that “every campus had a Turning Point display table set up in as prominent, and as high-traffic, an area as campus would permit us to occupy. The table for this week displayed banners and signage noting ‘Big Government Sucks,’ and ‘Saying No to Obamacare.’”
Though Amirani says she coordinates with Turning Point staff, she said she had no knowledge of Dunn’s association with them. Following the publication of the New Yorker piece, she took the article to a club meeting with her and asked her fellow club members if they knew anything about it. Most of them, Amirani said, didn’t even know who Dunn was.
“As far as the USC [Turning Point chapter] goes, I’m pretty sure everybody else was really confused too, because they were all like, ‘Really? Austin Dunn is conservative? What conservative thing has he done?’” Amirani said.
REACHING A TURNING POINT
Previous USG presidents Rini Sampath and Saucedo say the main issue is not necessarily whether affiliations with special interest groups break the USG Elections Code or bylaws, but rather the precedent it sets for the organization. 
“I think that it’s dangerous to allow these special interest groups to exploit our students in that way, to allow them to essentially — while our students are developing their views and perspectives on social issues and financial issues — come in and impose their political agendas on them,” said Sampath, who served as president in the 2015-2016 term. “[It’s] quite scary.”
Saucedo said he was also disturbed by the allegations of election interference. But he said these allegations should lead to change within USG.
“I think the organization as a whole should be asking questions about how this impacts them and the work that they have been doing for such a long time,” Saucedo said. “Whether these allegations are true or not … I think any good leader would take proactive measures to ensure something like this doesn’t happen again.”
Dunn said he hears this sentiment and agrees. He said he’s been thinking about the future of USG, the future administration and how they can be better supported to prevent something like this from happening again. He said he plans to sit down with the next president and have a discussion about how to avoid the missteps he made.
“I think what’s upsetting, [for] what many people deem as public figures, our interests don’t really matter to these organizations,” Dunn said. “At the end of the day, nobody cares how that affected me and our student organization, and that’s upsetting in itself.”
Dunn said he’s ready to move on — from politics and from the Turning Point controversy. He said he doesn’t care for politics and studying political science and public diplomacy has only fortified in him how much he wants to leave politics behind. 
And so, after the interview, he did just that. While candidates just two buildings over vied to fill his spot, Dunn retreated back to the nearly empty USG office in his suit, laptop under his arm, for a few final moments of quiet.

The Own It student-run female empowerment organization held its second annual summit this Saturday at Bovard Auditorium, featuring over 100 speakers, including “Friends” actress Lisa Kudrow and six-time Olympian medalist and Trojan alumna Rebecca Soni.
The summit featured three main panels throughout the day, as well as breakout sessions with smaller workshops for the over 500 attendees. 
Through the summit, Own It hopes to connect female students to the successful women they look up to, according to their website. 
The event  began with a welcome address by President C. L. Max Nikias, and a speech by  U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu, who represents California’s 27th District. Chu talked about her experience as the first Chinese American woman elected to the United States Congress, and the importance of strong mentors to her success. 
One of the panels at the event was  “Entertaining Change,” which featured Kudrow, CBS Executive Tiffany Smith-Anoa’i and stand up comedian and actress Yvonne Orji. The panel touched upon the #MeToo movement and its implications for future generations of women. . Kudrow spoke about changing the world’s mindset on sexual harassment  to one of positive growth rather than punishment.
“The only thing that makes me nervous is if there’s too much hatred and recrimination,” Kudrow said. “ Because there are, I think, mostly decent men. They just need the cultural support to behave decently … It’s about encouragement instead of criminalization.”
Another panel featured five female Olympians who graduated from USC, including volleyball players April Ross and Nicole Davis and swimmer Rebecca Soni. The panel was moderated by ESPN reporter and Annenberg adjunct professor Shelley Smith.
“It’s really exciting to be part of this movement with female empowerment,” Soni said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “And obviously to be able to be on a panel with a group of Olympians, and Trojan Olympians, is really great.”
In another panel, titled “Startup Superwomen,” Brooklyn Decker, who founded the clothing brand the Finery, said that more female-run businesses must be supported.
“It’s really hard to find women in tech who can mentor because there’s so few of them,” Decker said. “But if you’re supporting women in these companies, eventually we can be those mentors.”
The Own It summit is put together by 12 female USC students. The summit co-chair, Erica Wenger, is a junior studying business administration. 
“I decided to be part of Own It because I’m really passionate about women’s empowerment,” Wenger said. “We need to be supporting each other and having these powerful conversations. Especially because there has been a lot of stuff at USC where women aren’t being treated so fairly, so it’s really nice to have this day where we just appreciate women.”
Noelle Thomas, a junior studying psychology, attended the Own It summit.  
“The supportive nature about it is what’s so necessary and monumental,” Thomas said.  “It’s such a good environment and very motivating.”

After a year, the terms of Undergraduate Student Government President Austin Dunn and Vice President Morgan Monahan are coming to an end. During their presidential campaign, the two advocated their vision to “Achieve More” as representatives of the 19,000 undergraduate students they serve. Some of the progress Dunn and Monahan have made, via resolutions in the Senate, include the creation of a fall break initiative, the implementation of free hygiene products in campus restrooms and a rideshare partnership between USC and Lyft.  
Despite these  accomplishments, Dunn and Monahan agreed the most defining moments of their term occurred in the face of spontaneous crises.
“The biggest thing that strikes me this year is responding in real time to all of the issues that happened in our nation, because it affects communities and students on our campus,” Monahan said. “So, for instance, [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  initiative] was a big thing that we pulled together really quickly to support students.”
When the administration of President Donald Trump announced its decision to end DACA, the USG Senate passed a resolution to allocate $10,000 to aid DACA students’ application renewal fees.
While the DACA fund was a highly publicized amenity to students, Monahan expressed concern regarding a general lack of student awareness of on-campus resources, such as free legal counseling and complimentary shuttles to LAX. She and Dunn each referenced  examples of USC students who had learned about these useful resources too late in their academic career. 
“It is definitely an ongoing battle,” Dunn said. “We want to institutionalize initiatives that come out of USG in order to make them a part of campus culture, which would take some of the publicity efforts out of our hands.”
To address this, Monahan repeatedly cited the upcoming mandatory first-year wellness course as a potentially useful tool to inform incoming Trojans of the resources available on campus.
“I would say something that really spoke to me this year is that there is definitely a culture change happening on our campus,” Monahan said. “And I think one of the big catalysts of that is the first-year course initiative that we’re trying to do.”
Mental health and mindfulness were key issues addressed across USG this year, in several initiatives such as free access to the Calm mobile app — which promoted mindfulness and meditation — and the passing of a fall break resolution. Although it will not be implemented until 2019, the fall break initiative was strongly supported by students and serves the purpose of alleviating academic stress and improving mental health.
“We actually had a meeting with Provost [Michael] Quick on Jan. 25 and we got a date for fall break,” Monahan said. “It’s going to be the fall semester of 2019 in week eight.” 
The idea of a fall break is one that spawned and receded several times over the past five years, but a resolution finally passed the USG Senate, Graduate Student Government Senate, Academic Senate and Faculty Senate in Fall 2017. Much of the force behind this initiative was provided by an Engemann Student Health Center study, which showed that a spike in demand for counseling repeatedly occurs from weeks 8 to 10 in the fall semester.
Dunn recognized some confusion among students and faculty regarding when the new break will be implemented and hopes to address it.
“Our hope is, before the end of our term, to have a memo released to the entire university community signed by us and the provost making that totally publicized,” Dunn said.
Monahan elaborated on her vision for how the first-year wellness course can create a safer, better-informed and more tolerant atmosphere on campus.
“This first year course for all incoming freshman, spring admits, and transfer students will really create a culture of accountability, looking out for each other, and respect,” Monahan said. “And culture doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s going to be impacted by things that happen on campus.”
Dunn said the shifting norms on campus were his and Monahan’s favorite development during their administration. He referred to the fall break resolution as an example of how this progress is manifesting.
“If we had to sum up what we are most proud of, in one word, it would be culture,” Dunn said. “Just because these things we’re listing have to do with that. Fall break focused on destigmatizing mental health and supporting our students in times of crisis in weeks eight to ten.”
In the aftermath of Christina Yokoyama’s termination as the former director of the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund, many USG officials and students questioned the ability of students to influence decisions made by the USC administration. Dunn acknowledged these concerns, and explained he has tried to address them by meeting with administrators more often.
“In my entire time as vice president [during the 2016-2017 term], I only saw [Vice President for Student Affairs] Ainsley Carry three times,” Dunn said. “I now see him weekly, usually even more than once a week. I couldn’t ask to be better supported by the provost. In that realm, that is definitely something that we have made great strides in but that’s not to say that everything we say to the provost, Dr. Carry, or [President C. L. Max] Nikias is immediate policy.” 
When asked what advice she would offer to the current USG candidates, Monahan emphasized personal wellness and trying to preserve oneself.
“Wellness is an important aspect of this and making sure that you fill up your own cup before you fill up others,” Monahan said. “And just make sure you are reaching out to as many people as possible, but doing it in a responsible manner for yourself.”
Dunn added that candidates ought to remember what inspired  them to join student government, and to stay true to those motives.
“Every student who’s running or who gets involved in student government has a reason for having done so,” Dunn said. “And I think that one thing that campaigns and the dirtiness of elections and the stress of life can often take away from staying at your core.”
Dunn concluded by reminding the next USG president to seek assistance from all members of USG, and to work on every issue as a team regardless of who receives the spotlight.
“Even though I might be the first point of contact on a particular issue, or I might have to give a speech on a particular thing, I am never doing that as me; I am always doing that with USG as my team,” Dunn said. “To know that you have the support of your team behind your back is pretty great. My biggest piece of advice is to rely on the amazing people around you.”

Undergraduate Student Government leaders’ yearly stipends are measurably higher than those of other college leaders in the state.
Last year, the Daily Trojan reported that former USG Senator Kate Oh and former Executive Director of the Academic Culture Assembly Luis Vidalon-Suzuki presented a proposition to pay all USG members hourly at Los Angeles County’s wage rate, rather than by varying yearly stipends. 
However, Oh was unable to produce any change, as Section 4.C of Article X of the USG Bylaws states that changes to stipend values can only be proposed during the fall semester of even years. However, if Oh’s proposal had passed, it would have decreased the USG president’s stipend by $2,000 and the vice president’s by $845, the Daily Trojan reported. 
The highest-paid position in USG is the president, who receives $10,000 a year, followed by the USG vice president, who receives $8,000 a year, according to USG Bylaws. 
The chief of staff, treasurer, senior director of programming,  speaker pro tempore and senior director of communications — all part of the president’s executive staff — receive $6,000 a year. Advocacy directors receive $3,400 a year and senators receive $2,000 a year. The lowest stipends are for the parliamentarian and secretary at $1,500.
UC Berkeley determines the stipend of students serving the student body in their general budget. This academic year, the school’s student body president and vice president receive $4,000 each while their chiefs of staff each receive $2,000. Berkeley’s 20 senators receive $500 for the year.

Stanford University’s undergraduate bylaws are private, but in the undergraduate-graduate joint bylaws, it is stated that the maximum compensation for positions other than chief of staff is $500 per year.
The USG stipends are not based on the minimum wage rate, according to 2016 – 2017 USG president Edwin Saucedo. Current California minimum wage is $10.50, and Los Angeles County minimum wage is $13.25 for organizations with 26 or more workers. According to section 1.G of Article II of the USG bylaws, the USG president is expected to work 20 hours each week during the 30 weeks in the school year. 
“In my experience in USG, every student leader worked more hours than their job description called for,” Saucedo said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “A typical week when I was president required 20-30 hours of work both inside and outside of the office. On given weeks this could be more depending on meetings or projects.”
If the USG president were to work solely the required 20 hours per week, the president’s hourly wage would amount to $16.67 per hour, above both state and county minimum wages.
Some positions are comparable to minimum wage, as USG advocacy directors receive $3,400 a year and are expected to work 10 hours a week, making their hourly pay about $11.33. 
However, other positions are underpaid in comparison to minimum wage. USG Senators receive $8.33 per hour, and are expected to work eight hours a week and receive $2,000 a year.
“I was always a believer that every student leader in USG should be paid the same wage per hour,” Saucedo said in the email. “I was supportive of the president and executive cabinet being paid at the same wage as all other positions and their stipend being adjusted based on the number of hours their position requires.”
Katie Bolton, a USG senator, said she is concerned with the spending practices of the organization she serves. She said USG might not be making the most responsible choices with its budget.
“We are doing a lot of work [and] we are spending a lot of time,” Bolton said. “It’s also true that if it wasn’t paid, some students might not be able to do it because they need to make money elsewhere.”
Yet, she said she was worried about the amount of money that comes with certain positions. 
“I’m not sure if the amount that we’re paid necessarily makes sense,” Bolton said. “We want students to be doing this because they actually want to serve the student body, not just to build their resume and make money.”
Student stipends account for the second-largest portion of USG’s $2.3 million budget at $232,700, following the Concerts Committee which received $495,000 for the 2017-2018 school year. 
Olivia Pearson, the co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, which falls under the programming branch of USG, also believes that some stipends are too high. 
“Ten thousand dollars for a president — that is a little far-fetched in my opinion,” Pearson said. “Because that’s almost how much someone would make outside of school. Some people’s parents make $30,000 a year, so for your extracurricular activity to be making a third of someone’s living wage is a little much. So yes, stipends should be lower.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the figures of UCLA’s payments to student leaders. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In last year’s Undergraduate Student Government elections, only one candidate out of 13 who ran for Senate did not win a seat. Since then, USG has re-examined its elections process and implemented changes in an attempt to encourage more students to run for office, such as extending the application window and removing the signature quota a candidate must reach before campaigning. Called the largest election overhaul in several years by USG’s Director of Elections and Recruitment at the time, the result of the new policy’s first year was minimal: Only two more candidates are running for a seat.
Nicholas Fiorillo, current president of the USC College Democrats, initially considered running for office before ultimately deciding his passion for politics could be better served in other capacities.
“I know at USG, for example, they require you to spend so many hours in the office working on USG-related projects, while the work we do at College Democrats is a bit more flexible and varies based on the needs of the time,” Fiorillo said. “It’s a little more accessible, and more reflective of the work that I wanted to do at USC.”
One of the main items on Fiorillo’s agenda is to stimulate large-scale, on-campus interest in politics, rather than see students confine themselves to issues solely related to the USC community. While recognizing the outreach efforts that come from USG, Fiorillo saw the College Democrats as a more appropriate organization in which to focus his energy.
“I saw that I could have a more direct impact by encouraging young people on campus to get involved politically, as opposed to USG,” Fiorillo said. “For there to be a successful student body and climate here, I think you need both a strong student government led by talented, thoughtful people, but I also think you need groups like the College Democrats and others that encourage people to think beyond just what happens at USC and how we can have an impact in the national political conversation.”
On the other side of the aisle, leaders from the conservative student group Young Americans for Freedom pointed to the perceived liberal slant of many officers in USG as a reason for its members’ disinterest in getting involved. Club chairman Maxwell Brandon, like Fiorillo, said he considered running but decided not to after he said friends reminded him that his voice would be the minority in student government.
“I actually looked into applying for an appointed position, and one of my friends who was on it was like ‘Max, you know no one on USG’s political opinions line up with yours, you’re going to be miserable,’” Brandon said. “So I was like, ‘Well, maybe I should just do something else.’”
Shannon Hennessy, the vice chairman of YAF, said that USG is often too closed off when it comes to listening to conservative viewpoints.
“For me, it doesn’t really matter if they’re liberal,” Hennessy said. “It’s just a matter of whether or not they’re willing to hear our perspective, which a lot of the times that’s not the case.”
Additionally, Senator Isabella  Smith said that for some students, the senator position can appear intimidating.
Smith has been in USG since her freshman year as a delegate for the University Affairs Committee and later the director of a hospitality committee; yet, she admitted she was initially intimidated by the senatorial position’s prestige.
“Once I overcame my original fear, I ran to be a senator because I wanted to represent a lot of students and I feel like I am a good voice, because I am involved in a lot of different things on campus,” Smith said. 
Senator Christine Bradshaw said low engagement could also be due to the pressures of securing a senate position by election, rather than appointment.
“[I] would think that people would be more encouraged to run because it is so popular vote-based,” she said. “It is all campaign-based and what you can do for yourself it is self-driven.”
But Bradshaw said she decided to run for senate because she recognized USG’s unparalleled ability to tackle problems and advance initiatives. She also explained the role of senators as mediators who can create resolutions directly aimed to address students’ needs.
“The main things that [senators] do are advocacy projects,” Bradshaw said. “We occasionally put out surveys to see what the student body is feeling or if we have something we are really passionate about.”

After two on-the-road last-minute losses to both UCLA and Arizona State, USC dropped its third-straight game as the Arizona Wildcats triumphed over the Trojans in an 81-67 victory on Saturday night in Tucson. 
Senior guard Jordan McLaughlin put up 16 points in the Trojans’ 81-67 loss to the Arizona Wildcats. Tal Volk | Daily Trojan.
“This is the first game in the second half that the other team has outplayed us significantly and that’s why they beat us,” head coach Andy Enfield told reporters after the game. “But the other games we have been right there. Our team is playing good basketball. Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to close out the last two games.”
Saturday night’s loss was USC’s ninth-straight loss at the McKale Center and, combined with USC’s 80-78 loss to ASU Thursday night, their sixth -straight road sweep in the state of Arizona.
Riding a two-game losing streak of their own, the Wildcats came into Saturday night’s game with significant defensive struggles.
In the Cats’ 78-75 loss at Washington and 82-74 loss to UCLA, Arizona allowed opposing shooters to hit a combined 19-of-38 from 3-point range (50 percent) and 62-of-125 (49.6 percent) from the field overall.
And while a USC defense that allowed UCLA to hit 12 of its 26 3-point shots vastly improved against Arizona State (6-for-23 from beyond the arch), USC’s 3-point offense hit a combined 17-55 (30.9 percent) over that same stretch. 
As luck would have it, USC’s outside shooting suffered, while Arizona’s soared.
The Wildcats, thanks to step-up offensive nights from sophomore guard Rawle Alkins and junior guard Allonzo Trier, hit nine of their 20 3-point shots, including 5-for-10 in the first half alone. 
USC, on the other hand, hit just six of their 19 shots with senior point guard Jordan McLaughlin hitting three-of-his-four from deep. 
“Give Arizona credit, they played exceptionally well offensively,” Enfield said. “And when we had a chance to stop their runs, we missed some wide open 3’s and just some shots that we need to make if you’re going to try to beat a team on their home court like this.”
Despite these shooting struggles, USC forwards junior Chimezie Metu and sophomore Nick Rakocevic kept the game close for the Trojans early in the game. 
After going down 14-9 with 14:06 left in the first half, buckets from Rakocevic and Metu put the Trojans up 20-18. 
Unfortunately for USC, Arizona would proceed to go on a 19-11 run and close the first half with a 37-31 lead. 
Alkins and Trier combined to hit 5-of-6 from deep downtown in the first 20 minutes as Rakocevic led all Trojan scorers with eight points off of 4-5 shooting from the field. 
Usually a scoring and offensive threat, McLaughlin was held scoreless and assist-less for the first 10 minutes of play.
In complete contrast to the first half, McLaughlin would explode in the second half for five assists, 16 points and three 3-pointers off of 5-for-8 shooting from the floor.
Other than junior forward Chimezie Metu, who poured in 11 points off of 4-of-7 shooting, the rest of the USC offense was surprisingly ineffective. 
The first four minutes saw McLaughlin and Metu combine for eight points as USC’s 10-0 run tied the game up at 41-41 with 16:19 remaining. 
After a McLaughlin jumper put the Trojans down just 48-47 with 13:05 remaining, the Wildcats cruised to 33 points as Arizona’s bigs freshman DeAndre Ayton and senior Dusan Ristic dominated the paint. 
While Ayton added 10 points on 3-of-7 shooting, it was Ristic’s team-high 12 points in the second half that proved to be the difference in what was a close game for USC.
Not to mention, the Wildcats controlled the offensive and defensive glass, out-rebounding the Trojans 40-22 in USC’s worst rebounding night of season. 
The last time Troy was out-rebounded to this extent was against a Texas A&M squad that beat USC 75-59 at Galen Center earlier this year.
“The whole game, just going up against guys [who are] 7-feet, 250 [pounds], that’s going to be brutal for anybody,”  Rakocevic said. “Just seeing those guys block to block, it was difficult, but they’re good players. They’re big-time players, so we’ve just got to get better, we’ll be alright.”
Rakocevic, who led the Trojans with nine rebounds, also led the team in personal fouls, fouling out with 4:37 left in the game as the Trojans were down 68-58.
Without Rakocevic, all of USC’s final nine points were scored by either Metu or McLaughlin, who finished the game with 18 and 16, respectively.
Noticeably absent was redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron, one of USC’s better defensive and rebounding guards, who did not play due to a coach’s decision. 
McLaughlin, who led all guards in scoring and assists, said after the game that a lack of effort contributed to USC’s biggest loss in Pac-12 play. 
“This one we just didn’t keep fighting,” McLaughlin said. “That’s all we gotta do, keep fighting all the way until the end and even if we’re not making shots, we gotta keep fighting.”

The No. 14 USC men’s volleyball team lost a close contest in four sets to No. 7 BYU Saturday.

After a strong win over Stanford last Thursday for their fourth win of the season, USC looked to continue their momentum against the visiting Cougars. However, the task would prove to be difficult against a resilient and well-balanced BYU squad. 
The Cougars boast an impressive resume this year with an 8-4 record, including wins over No. 8 Lewis, No. 5 Ohio State and No. 13 UC Santa Barbara. The dynamic opposite-outside hitting duo of freshman Gabi Garcia Fernandez and senior Brenden Sander led the Cougars in a game with very little room for error, as USC managed to stay within two points in every lost set. 
Sander recorded career-highs of 23 kills and five service aces while hitting .372. Fernandez clipped .441 with 18 kills, while senior setter Leo Durkin had a season-high 54 assists along with eight digs. Senior libero Erik Sikes contributed nine digs and two assists, and senior middle blocker Price Jarman had four blocks.
For USC, the game simply slipped out of their hands. The Trojans had multiple opportunities to seal the deal and win a set, but a few service errors and clutch kills from Sander proved to be the difference. 
USC posted scorelines of 21-19, 17-12, 23-23 and 25-25 before falling in all but the second set. 
USC’s trio of junior outside hitters Jack Wyett, Ryan Moss and Gianluca Grasso once again led the team in the narrow defeat. Wyett had a balanced game with 12 kills, one ace and six digs. Moss had a team-high with 16 kills, along with one ace and one assist. Grasso contributed nine kills, three aces and five digs. USC was badly out-hit by BYU, which as a team clipped .372 compared to USC’s .321. 
USC’s  season continues to look murkier by the day, with no apparent end to the constant losing cycles that have defined their season. 
With their brutal schedule, the Trojans will likely drop out of the AVCA top 15, with all eight of their losses being to ranked schools. Four of their next five games are opposing ranked teams —  No. 2 UCLA, No. 11 Pepperdine, No. 10 Grand Canyon and No. 13 UC Santa Barbara. 
It isn’t a stretch to say that these next few games could make or break the Trojans’ year, and perhaps even head coach Jeff Nygaard’s job. Needless to say, it is imperative that Nygaard keeps morale up and lights a fire under his unit in whatever way possible before it is too late. 
The team will now travel to Westwood to take on the No. 2 UCLA Bruins in an MPSF match scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Growing up in the frigid state of Michigan, hockey was an integral part of my life as a young athlete. 
I took my first steps onto the ice when I was six years old, and believe me, they were not voluntary. I vividly remember resisting my father as he pushed me out onto the ice. Despite my initial intense passion to avoid the ice, I grew to love the game of hockey — as do most Michiganders. 
Hockey is a significant part of the mitten state’s sports culture. There are universities in the middle of nowhere in Michigan with hockey as their one and only D-I sport — and they are really, really good. It also helps that we have (well, had) a darn good hockey team. The Detroit Red Wings’ 25-year postseason appearance streak in which they won four Stanley Cup Championships made it extremely easy to be a Detroit hockey fan.
Professional hockey is exciting, but that excitement is unrivaled by Olympic hockey. With the NHL, fans are divided among their respective teams. I have to share an office with an Anaheim Ducks fan. We are pretty good friends, but I guarantee if our respective teams met in the Stanley Cup Championships, we would become mortal enemies for the seven-game series.
Sports rivalries are fun. However, the Olympics brings everyone together to root for one collective team. It’s a beautiful thing. 
My freshman year of high school I remember sitting in class anxiously watching the USA women’s hockey team go for the gold on the school projector. The experience was wonderful. Thirty of my fellow peers (some not even hockey fans) and I watched the team compete. The Olympic platform brought us together to root for one organization. USA ended up taking home the silver medal, but that game remains one of my favorite sporting events. 
I have really mixed feelings this year. The International Olympic Committee announced that they would no longer cover the costs of travel, insurance, accommodations and other costs for NHL players. The NHL and IOC were unable to come to terms regarding these costs and thus the NHL had to pull their athletes from competing in the 2018 games. 
The world’s best hockey players come to America and Canada to compete in the NHL. Not having NHL players compete in the Olympics just isn’t good for the sport. There are very few people who think this was the right decision. The NHL players want to represent their respective countries and compete for a world championship. They should not be deprived of that opportunity.
“The players are extraordinarily disappointed and adamantly disagree with the NHL’s short-sighted decision to not continue our participation in the Olympics,” the NHL Players’ Association said in a Twitter statement last April. “NHL players are patriotic and they do not take this lightly. A decent respect for the opinions of the players matters. This is the NHL’s decision, and its alone. It is very unfortunate for the game, the players and millions of loyal hockey fans.”
However, there is a silver lining. Without the participation of the many Olympic athletes from the NHL, the USA hockey team is desperate for players. This forces them to look toward college and amateur players. What a stage for up-and-coming players. It is difficult to break into the professional hockey scene, and PyeongChang could make a name for a lot of young athletes.
There is something to be said for amateur athletes who make it to a big stage. There is some type of magic that seemingly propels them to accomplish the impossible. Think about New York Yankees All-Star Aaron Judge. Judge was a very average player in the minors, but when he came to the major league, he blew up. Rookies and amateurs take advantage of their opportunity.
Regardless, it won’t be an easy run for the U.S. team. Lacking players in the likes of Ryan Kesler, Phil Kessel and Patrick Kane makes it increasingly difficult for the U.S. to win gold. 
All hope is not lost for the American hockey team. Perhaps the greatest hockey game in history, “Miracle on Ice” took place with a hodge podge team lacking NHL players. USA entered the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. with a ragtag team. Defying all odds, the team made it to the medal round and defeated a seemingly unstoppable Soviet Union squad. 
It’s going to be an interesting Olympic games for the sport of hockey, but I’m hopeful for a young and hungry Team USA. To the team, in the famous words of coach Herb Brooks, “This is your time. Now go out there and take it.”

Indie rock band Franz Ferdinand released its fifth studio album Always Ascending on Friday, about four-and-a-half years since their last release, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Actions. It’s also the band’s first release since the departure of one of its founding members, guitarist Nick McCarthy. To fill the void, two new members have since joined Franz Ferdinand: Dino Bardot and Julian Corrie. 
From the opening track, it’s also clear that Always Ascending is quite a departure from the rest of Franz Ferdinand’s discography. The album artwork itself represents the overall stylistic changes, featuring a black background — a common feature of Franz Ferdinand album covers — with bright neon text streaked across it. This cover best captures the evolution of the band’s style: sounding like previous Franz Ferdinand work, but with just enough new elements to make it distinct from previous projects. 
It’s hard to call Franz Ferdinand an indie rock band anymore. The album does not rely on heavy guitar as much as their previous works, but instead features a developed, well-balanced fusion of styles and instruments. They utilize newer musical production technology, but do not overly rely on or abuse it, skillfully blending guitar and synth. 
Lyrically, Franz Ferdinand disguises deeper, profound and sometimes existential messages in synthesized dance bops. The titular song, “Always Ascending,” contains many of these messages, while mirroring the title in the production with sounds that are literally always ascending. The title is about the song’s production, but is also existential contemplation disguised in a synth heavy dance song, as proven by lyrics like “Always and always and always ascending / The opening line leaves an uncertain ending” and “We can ascend from this arrangement / We can see fate as entertainment.”
Franz Ferdinand has built an extensive indie rock catalogue since their formation in 2002, but on Always Ascending the band experiments with a new sound, fusing a variety of styles and instruments that utilize more modern musical production technology. Photo courtesy of Cara Robbins.
“Lois Lane” provides another example of synth-laden production disguising deeper lyrics and themes. Over the catchy beat, the singer recites philosophical lines such as, “The motivation of altruism is selfishness / The desire for the pleasure of the reward.”
Other notable tracks harken back to the sound of earlier Franz Ferndinand albums, such as “Lazy Boy” and “Finally.” “Lazy Boy” showcases Franz Ferdinand’s tongue-in-cheek style; it’s also the album’s shortest song, clocking in at 2:59, and the most repetitive song on the album, perhaps a reference to the title. While easily the laziest song, it’s undeniably catchy.
Lyrically, “Finally” is like 2018’s answer to “This Must Be The Place” by Talking Heads. It is a pleasant, simple appreciation or “love song” dedicated to close friends: “Oh, then suddenly I’m home / Finally I found my people/ I found the people who were meant to be found by me / Finally, finally, finally I’m here / In my place, so I’m here /  God, how it heals you to feel / God, how it feels good to be with the people like me.” 
The weakest links of the album are what seem to be attempts at ballads with “The Academy Award” and “Slow Don’t Kill Me Now.” They feel out of place among the infectious tone that characterizes the rest of Always Ascending. Franz Ferdinand is truly in its element with bolder, upbeat songs. 
Always Ascending proves that Franz Ferdinand is doing just that: ascending. Overall, the album is a strong blend of “classic” Franz Ferdinand, and new synth-dance influences. Despite the instrumentation style changes, the tone of previous Franz Ferdinand albums remains in tact. The lyrics have not taken a back seat to the updated  production. While it is a bit of a departure from the band’s previous work, fans should take heed of what is said in the album’s title track and “feel no fear.”

These days, new albums, collaborations and singles are popping up around every corner, which is certainly good news for the everyday music fan. Prolific artists like Gucci Mane, BROCKHAMPTON and Future have proven themselves to be more than capable of releasing multiple projects in a single year, and with so many aspiring artists hungry to have their music heard by the masses, it’s become common for multiple highly-anticipated albums to be released on any given Friday. The never-ending onslaught of new material has made the music industry one of the most exciting fields to follow, but it’s also created dangerous expectations from fans and a toxic environment for many musicians. Rather than taking to social media to lament an artist’s absence from the spotlight, it’s important to remember that a musician’s mental health is just as important as our own, and that patience from fans is necessary to ensure the final product is as impressive as it can be.
Artists with the ability and desire to rapidly create hit songs like it’s nothing deserve to be commended, but for many others, the creative process takes time and thought. Music is one of the strongest forms of expression in existence, and the amount of work required to effectively carry out one’s vision for an album can at times be a Herculean task.
Take KAYTRANADA, for instance. The heralded producer made waves with his 2016 debut album 99.9%, yet hardly a year after its release, many of the same fans who were praising the album were doggedly pressuring him to release another. Eventually, the noise prompted KAYTRANADA to tweet a thank you to his fans who were “patient,” promising his next creation would be worth the wait. R&B group The Internet, who performed at Springfest in 2016, has endured much of the same stresses, despite various band members such as lead singer Syd, guitarist Steve Lacy and keyboardist Matt Martians releasing solo projects in the meantime.

The wait can certainly be grueling, but more often than not, it’s also worth it. R&B singer Frank Ocean tormented fans for four years following his breakthrough channel ORANGE, but the eventual follow-up Blonde was a staple across “Best of 2016” lists. Similarly, indie pop artist Lorde took four years off after releasing Pure Heroine, and 2017’s Melodrama saw her take a huge step forward after taking time to grow both personally and artistically.
“Hustlin’, arguing about who’s better than I in tweets / but what does it matter when a new artist comes out like every week?” Rapper Big K.R.I.T. ponders on “Drinking Sessions,” a track where he lays out his struggles with depression and hopelessness after over a decade of putting out music. Big K.R.I.T. has fought tooth and nail to remain relevant in the industry while receiving little support and enduring years of restraint from his label, Def Jam. It makes his revelation here even more biting, essentially questioning the very importance of the craft he’s dedicated the better part of his life to honoring. 
But when a new album by another artist is coming down the pipeline before fans even have time to digest the latest release, the lyric rings true; the blistering album schedule not only shortens the amount of time fans are willing to wait for a new project, but also means that albums can fade out of the conversation before they’ve been able to make their intended impact.
Rather than expecting an artist to fulfill our own selfish needs and moving on from them when they don’t, it’s important for fans to respect a musician’s own timeline for creating. Trying to rush an artist into dropping a project is futile, and certainly won’t better the final product when it’s all said and done. Be grateful your favorite artist is taking the time to put maximum effort and care into their music — it’s probably the reason they’ve managed to become so successful in the first place. 
Why I’m Smiling: Will Smith parodies Jaden Smith’s music video for “Icon”
What’s the only thing better than watching actor-musician Jaden Smith strut his way out of a luxury car in the middle of the wilderness? Watching his 49-year-old father Will Smith try to do the same thing. Celebrating his son earning 100 million Spotify streams off his 2017 album SYRE, the elder Smith continued to stake his claim for the best Instagram account of the year with a clip of him recreating his son’s commanding video for “Icon.” It’s not easy to moonwalk in a pair of house slippers, and Will Smith is no exception, but the attempt alone is more than enough to please. 
Why I’m Shaking My Head: BlocBoy JB cancels all appearances to renegotiate price after receiving a feature from Drake 
Somewhere right now a struggling rapper is furiously writing 16 bars about why he doesn’t need your co-sign, but BlocBoy JB is living proof that a strong co-sign still doesn’t hurt. The same day his Drake-assisted song “Look Alive” released, his manager announced on Instagram that all contracts with promoters and the like would have to be renegotiated with a new price, due to “an overwhelming amount of calls and offers.” You’re not alone if you’ve never heard of the Memphis rapper who earned brief fame last year for his viral dance in the music video for his song “Shoot,” but it’s safe to assume you’ll now be hearing his voice more often.
Why I’m Hopeful for the Future: Effected – Cozz (Feb. 13)
Two years ago, Cozz took the stage at Springfest to perform for no more than 100 people in the afternoon. On Tuesday, rappers Kendrick Lamar and J.Cole are slated to appear on the Dreamville rapper’s debut album, Effected. Cozz’s gritty, earnest lyrics first put him on the map with his 2014 mixtape Cozz & Effect, but has since flown somewhat under the radar while the label pushed out impressive projects from the likes of Bas, J.I.D and EarthGang. That’s not for lack of talent on Cozz’s behalf, however, and expect him to make the most of his moment on his heavily anticipated project.
