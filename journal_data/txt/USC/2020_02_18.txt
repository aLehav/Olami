The topics that social media users, specifically tweeters, dedicate their energy and phone batteries to are exhaustingly repetitive. Whether discussing the merits of paying $200 for a date or their collective disdain for TMZ, there are a lot of discussions that aren’t worth having on the internet anymore. 
The worst of them all? Top *insert number here* rappers. 
Anyone who likes hip-hop and engages in debate on the subject via social media is familiar with the chaos that explodes when the rankings come out. Back in August, The Brew Podcast shared a list of the “Top 50 Greatest Rappers of All-Time,” with Jay-Z and Nas in the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively, and then New Jersey’s Joe Budden at No. 3. I won’t explicitly say my opinion on the rankings, but one of the three is a rather bold and egregious placement. 
This week, in the spirit of the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, hosts of Complex Magazine’s online TV show “Everyday Struggle” conceived their own starting line-up of “2020 Rap All-Star,” which, of course, sparked debate on the rise of Roddy Rich and the reigning relevance of Drake.
All of this banter is great content for a full-blown production but translates into angry fans tweeting into the void on the app. Outside of these more popular occurrences, various accounts exist to discuss the genre in detail: think Genius’ Twitter account or @checktheryme1. 
While many of these online conversations spark healthy debate (and snide jokes), the majority of them lack serious nuance, and those who participate take themselves a bit too seriously. I’ve personally sacrificed hours of my life, using my dexterity to fight off internet trolls because of my off-beat opinions on hip-hop.  
There’s nothing I hate more than a 41-year-old fan obsessed with the golden era of hip-hop arguing with a 19-year-old Chance the Rapper fanatic over who is the “greatest rapper of all time.” Although there are some young people, like myself, dedicated to the genre from its New York conception to its current status, the average young adult will not rank KRS-One or Redman anywhere near the No. 1 spot. 
When the rap-centric Twitter debates arise, rap purists (think those who hate Lil Uzi and listen to “Illmatic” by Nas on a weekly basis) act as if they own the conversation surrounding what or who is considered to be the gold standard in the genre. And most times, frat boys who solely listen to Kanye West (or whatever new record is acceptable in white spaces) couldn’t name any of the classic records that came out in 1996 (“Reasonable Doubt,” “It Was Written,” “The Score,” “ATLiens,” etc.) 
It’s not to say that one side is more valid than the other, but debates over hip-hop are highly subjective to one’s age, race, region or just personal taste. When we hear DJ Akademiks’ God-awful takes or listen to The Joe Budden Podcast, although not perfect, there’s room for thorough conversation and for the show’s personalities to dive deeper into the “why” behind their choices. But a single tweet, capped at 280 characters, or even a thread of five to six tweets, simply will not suffice anymore as healthy conversation around rap music. 
The solution? I can’t force anyone not to talk about rap on Twitter; just the other day, my mentions were flooded after I said Drake’s “Tuscan Leather” was the “first skip” on his 2014 “Nothing Was The Same.” But I can encourage us all to not take these conversations or our opinions on music in general so seriously and personally. I also urge those who choose to confer about hip-hop to take the opinions of others, which float aimlessly in the Twittersphere, with a grain of salt. 
I’ve come to learn that not everyone will agree that Jay-Z is the greatest rap artist of all time, and that’s perfectly OK. Although I critique him fearlessly, I’m from the East Coast and listen to him every day as a means of survival — a stan, as some call me. My opinion, like all of these conversations, isn’t tethered to some algorithmic ranking system but rather human experience and emotion. 
Just like any healthy political debate, when someone disagrees with my position I take time to engage in the “why” behind theirs. There’s nothing better than listening to a personal rant about the music and artists people love and in turn being inspired to give a song or record a first look or second chance. 
In 2020, I want all of us hip-hop heads to use our Twitter fingers in a smarter way. The next time an account asks: “Which rapper has the best three-album run?” don’t argue with a friend but rather look at it as an experience to discover something new.

Born and raised in Chicago at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, John Simmons, a USC alumnus, witnessed some of the most important moments in history. He is a member of the American Society of Cinematographers and won an Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series in 2016 as director of photography on an episode of the Nickelodeon series “Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn.” 
His exhibition, “No Crystal Stair: The Photography of John Simmons,” opened last November at the Museum of African American Art. The exhibit features images selected from Simmons’ archive that depict the profoundness of his early work. 
Simmons has used his experience at USC to provide students with the knowledge he gained throughout his career. 
“I do my TV shows, I take pictures, I paint and I do my thing,” Simmons said of his life following his time as a professor at UCLA. For 26 years, Simmons served as an associate adjunct professor of cinematography at UCLA’s School of Theatre, Film and Television. 
Simmons’ journey began with street photography. A camera in hand, on the roads of Chicago, he captured life as he witnessed it. 
“I was about recording the life that I lived, [that] I saw, that I breathed, that I listened to,” Simmons said. 
As a teenager in the 1960s, Simmons began working for the Chicago Defender, the first Black publication in America. His first mentor Robert Sengstacke, a photographer at the paper, took him under his wing after seeing what he could do with a camera. He gave him a book, “The Sweet Flypaper of Life” by Langston Hughes, with photos by Roy DeCarava, that Simmons said has guided his career and experience as well as those of many other photographers.
Simmons considers landing the job at this time in history to be the best thing that has ever happened to him. As a photographer at the Chicago Defender, he approached his subjects with the goal of giving each image its own narrative. 
“Although it was meant to be photojournalism, I was trying to tell [a] story with one picture,” Simmons said. 
After developing his skills, he became Sengstacke’s assistant. When Sengstacke received an offer to be an artist in residence in Nashville, Tenn. at Fisk University, he invited Simmons to come with him. Simmons, who had not yet received a high school diploma, finished high school in Chicago so he could follow Sengstacke to Fisk. 
Simmons recalled the famous Black icons he got to see in Nashville during the tail end of the civil rights era. 
“Who would show up?” Simmons said. “Angela Davis, Nikki Giovanni, Miles Davis, Alice Coltrane, Eldridge Cleaver. You know, it was like the spot. It drew me right into a Black cultural mecca.”
Among some of his projects, Simmons helped Aaron Douglas, a painter from the Harlem Renaissance, repaint a mural for a whole year. It was a town buzzing with talent and culture, Simmons said.
While taking classes at Fisk, he met professor and soon-to-be mentor Carlton Moss, who told him he was a natural cinematographer and should pursue cinematography at USC.
Simmons said going to USC was a bit of a culture shock coming from Chicago and Nashville. 
“I grew up in Chicago, on the south side of Chicago, working for a Black newspaper and Muhammad Speaks newspaper,” Simmons said. “I had never been around a lot of white folks before.” 
The shock did not end there. Upon entering USC, Simmons soon learned that he was the only Black person in the film department. Despite this challenge, the knowledge Simmons obtained was beneficial on sets where people would doubt his credentials. 
“My education at USC was so thorough that any time somebody put me under the microscope of … ‘Do you know what you’re talking about?’ I knew because I had learned it at school,” Simmons said. “I’d get on a set and I’d be with those white boys and they would challenge me on something. Before they knew it, I was running down what I learned at USC. They had to back up a little bit because they hadn’t been to school.”
Regardless, Simmons said he found his time at USC to be rewarding. He believes learning from School of Cinematic Arts professor Sherwood “Woody” Omens about screen graphics made his entire education at USC worth it. 
“I learned so much from him and even today, I’ll get on a set and I know exactly where an idea came from — and it came from him,” Simmons said.
Simmons described the differences between the mediums of cinematography and photography. While they have similar aspects, like capturing the image, light and composition, Simmons finds a photograph to be more like a painting. 
“The narrative is told in one frame,” Simmons said. “When I press the shutter, I want to be able to tell you everything I can in that moment.” 
As he learned from Sengstacke, “It has to have a ghost in it ­— it has to have a soul.”
However, Simmons explained, with cinematography, the viewer expects numerous images accompanied by elements like sound. These expectations are not present with photography.
“You sit there as an audience member and you wait for the next picture to come on,” Simmons said. “And you’re not [fulfilled] as an audience until all those pictures together with dialogue and sound turn into a narrative.”
Unlike cinematography, where Simmons has to execute what has been agreed on by a director, producer and network, Simmons said when he takes his still camera in his pocket, there’s nobody else’s vision to execute but his own.  
“Nobody’s telling me nothing,” Simmons said. “It’s [me] bringing to that experience everything that’s ever happened … All the things that make me happy, all the things that make me sad. Everything that I’ve ever learned. I click that shutter and at that moment, my point of view has been influenced by everything that’s ever made me, me.”
Simmons has inspired many and helped aspiring photographers that he’s met, causing many to call him a mentor.  
“When I run into somebody that has the same love [of photography] we begin a relationship,” Simmons said. “For them it’s mentoring, for me it’s like meeting this other person that loves what I love.”
Eli Assraf, a junior majoring in business administration, first met Simmons at a gallery in West Hollywood. The two were staring at the same picture and began to bond over their mutual love of photography. Assraf cites Simmons’ approach to life as one of the cinematographer’s most inspiring traits. 
“I don’t think once since I’ve met him have I ever seen him with a frown or unhappy,” Assraf said. “For him it’s about going out and giving back … If he believes in you and he sees something of himself in you, he will help you no matter what.”
Simmons’ exhibit at The Museum of African American Art is on display until March 29.

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” I have always found this inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty to be a beautiful affirmation of our better nature: the part of us that feels the pain of others and wishes to help.
But we passed the Chinese Exclusion Act four years before the Statue of Liberty was even installed and today there are miles of metal wall under construction in Texas — we’ve never been that selfless nation described in the poem. Even our arguments to exclude have stayed the same: immigrants depress wages, they bring crime and steal jobs and, on some level, immigrants threaten our culture. 
I do not think it’s shameful to agree with any of these statements; immigration policy should not be charity. And it should be easy to see why the Republican Party — increasingly composed of low-wage white voters — is hesitant to fling open the country’s gates: We have enough tired and enough poor of our own.  
I only think it’s a shame that so much suffering has been justified using obsolete ideas. The first argument, that immigrants depress wages, is only true when any two groups compete for the same positions. But this is not the case among the nation’s low wage jobs; there is no overflow of farmhands and landscapers, no unemployed crowds clamoring to pick berries in a hot field all day. 
And, really, U.S.-born workers don’t want these jobs. These positions tend to be physically strenuous, rote and unsafe. Because our country has a million-worker shortage and a rapidly aging population, the economy needs an immigrant workforce to fill these positions. According to Giovanni Peri, a professor of Economics at UC Davis, “Most economists agree that … immigrants have not come at the cost of either of American jobs, nor of American wages.”
Despite this, much of the anti-immigration rhetoric has centered on non-citizens being “public charges,” pointing to their supposed burden on the economy and social services. These arguments disregard the fact that we need immigrants as much as they need us. In addition to filling our worker shortages, immigrants contribute more than their fair share to the public pot. 
The average immigrant will pay $80,000 more in taxes than they receive in government services. In 2010, undocumented immigrants paid $13 billion into Social Security, and only got $1 billion back. If we deport these workers, as 70% of Republicans have supported, we’d be shooting ourselves in the foot. 
And the decision would be made to appease fear; at the base of the anti-immigration resurgence is a story that many conservative leaders have repeated: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” President Donald Trump has used the words “invasion” and “killer” 500 times at his rallies to describe immigrants.
But immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born Americans in part because they have so much more to lose. This is not to mention that unauthorized immigration was at a 12-year low in 2016 and that more Mexicans have been leaving the U.S. than arriving. So where does this story of invasion come from? 
The easy answer is politics. Trump chanted “build that wall” all the way to the White House. Banging on the anti-immigration drum turns out voters in droves. There is a political disincentive for conservatives to update their stance, even if it ends up harming the country. Conservative leaders craft anti-immigration policies because they know that immigrants largely vote Democratic. 
But the party didn’t invent immigration fears. There is a prevailing sentiment that immigrants threaten American culture, our traditions and way of life. This argument has no easy address, as there is no statistic that can disprove fear. 
All I can say is that American culture is tied to our multiculturalism, a history of accepting foreign aspirants to the fabled American dream. If we wall ourselves up to preserve some strange conception of our culture, then our culture will starve. 
Look around: We are all the children of immigrants, somewhere up the line.

Students walking down Trousdale Parkway during the Involvement Fair are bound to find a broad range of clubs all tied around a similar mission: community service. 
In fact, USC Campus Activities even breaks down service organizations at USC into different categories: clubs that provide meals to people, provide health services, provide legal services and consulting and provide focus on education.  
There are even ways students can get involved with community service beyond clubs and organizations on campus. The USC Volunteer Center states there are more than 300 nonprofits and community organizations that offer volunteer opportunities around USC.
Regardless of the kind of service performed, all recognized service organizations at USC should educate their members on the best way to approach community service and provide resources to learn from communities different from their own. By doing this, not only will students who are already volunteering have more meaningful experiences but those who have shied away from volunteering may be convinced to begin. 
Many organizations, whether due to a lack of time or resources, fail to teach people to check their biases or look at service in a constructive way before sending volunteers into the community. This lack of guidance leads to a common mistake where volunteers look at community service through the lens of a savior complex. 
This savior complex phenomenon occurs when people volunteer because they feel that others need them, and it is therefore the duty of the volunteer to save them. This is a line of thinking rooted in pity and an imbalanced power dynamic. With this viewpoint, the volunteer thinks of themselves as the sole teacher who can impart knowledge. This savior complex shuts people out from all the opportunities they have to learn while engaging with the community. 
Instead of creating an “us” versus “them” mentality, volunteers should establish mutually beneficial relationships with people to learn about a cause, injustice or new perspective they previously lacked knowledge about. In this way, community service organizations can cultivate volunteers aware of inherent, systematic issues in society while simultaneously providing a way to help communities. Community service is certainly not a one-sided exchange. In other words, the benefits, learning, growth and needs are a two-way street.
Most people involved in community service have good intentions. However, they may slip into the savior complex simply because they have never been taught to be conscious of it.
To make community service as meaningful as possible for all parties involved, student service organizations should bring in guests to speak to their members and provide necessary resources to train their members about how to best approach service. This “training” could be as simple as  a club inviting a professor to come in to explain something like the savior complex. 
An organization could also teach members about the kind of volunteering they participate in.  For example, if an organization’s focus is to tutor children from local schools, it could organize a workshop to teach volunteers concepts such as systematic education inequality or an emphasis on understanding that college is not the end goal for everyone. Community service organizations could also invite local nonprofit leaders from the same field of work to come in and talk about their experience and how service can extend far beyond college. 
The key is to look at service as a learning experience rather than as a way to impart knowledge to someone else. Placing an emphasis on a mutually beneficial relationship between volunteers and communities will create the most impact at both the individual and community level for all groups involved.
