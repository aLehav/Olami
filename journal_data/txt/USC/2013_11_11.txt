The USC men’s basketball team will attempt to bounce back from its season-opening loss to Utah State as it returns to the Galen Center tonight for the first home game of head coach Andy Enfield’s USC career against Cal State Northridge at 8 p.m.
Rise up · USC senior guard J.T. Terrell scored 20 points on eight-for-17 shooting in the team’s 78-65 season-opening loss to Utah State on Friday. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (0-1) were outlasted by an experienced Utah State team in their season opener, as the Aggies (1-0) pulled away in the second half to secure a 78-65 win in Enfield’s debut. Utah State’s Preston Medlin, who led the team in scoring last season, scored 17 points as one of  four Aggies in double-digits. USU led 40-33 at the half and pulled off runs of 16-5 and 9-0 to jump out to a 65-44 lead and earn the victory.
Senior guard J.T. Terrell led all scorers with 20 points. Junior guard Byron Wesley added 15 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists, while senior center Omar Oraby finished with 15 points and 9 rebounds.
Cal State Northridge (1-0) finished 14-17 last season, along with a 5-13 record in conference play to finish ninth in the Big West conference. The Matadors started the season 6-0 but were unable to keep that momentum up throughout the year, missing out on an NCAA Tournament berth for the fourth straight season. Guard Stephan Hicks led the team with 15.7 points per game and added 7.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals per game. Forward Stephen Maxwell averaged 14.6 points and 8.3 rebounds per game last season while playing in all 31 games, and guard Josh Greene had 14.5 points and 3.7 assists per game.
The Matadors opened their season with an 86-74 win over Hope International. Maxwell led the team with 23 points and 12 rebounds, while Hicks contributed 20 points and 9 rebounds.
The last time these two teams faced off was Nov. 11, 2011 at the Galen Center, which resulted in a 66-59 win for the Trojans. Former players Aaron Fuller and Dewayne Dedmon led the scoring attack with 16 points each, while former guard Maurice Jones scored eight of USC’s final 12 points to keep the Matadors from overcoming a 13-point deficit. Hicks led the Matadors with 16 points. Wesley, the only player remaining from the team that participated in that game, played 33 minutes and had five points and eight rebounds.
USC leads the all-time series against CSUN 5-1. The only blemish was an 81-76 overtime loss to start the 2005-2006 season. Tonight’s game will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.

As the Pac-12 women’s volleyball season comes to a close, USC freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu is showing no signs of slowing down. The young star out of Fairview, Texas had two more standout matches this past weekend en route to her fifth Pac-12 Freshman of the Week selection of the season.
Locked in · USC freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has been stellar this season with 267 kills, good for second-most on the team. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Over the weekend, Nwanebu took the lead on offense in the two sweeps against Oregon and Oregon State. Over the two matches, she recorded 23 total kills (3.83 kills per set) for a .488 hitting percentage. Against the Ducks on Friday, Nwanebu recorded 10 kills with only one error on 20 attempts for a .450 hitting percentage. She continued this pace in Sunday’s match, posting a .522 hitting percentage with 13 kills on 23 attempts against the Beavers.
USC has now won four matches in a row, and in each of those matches, Nwanebu has reached double-digits in kills. The correlation between Nwanebu’s offensive play and the team’s success is evident, and if she continues to play at this level, the Women of Troy will have an excellent opportunity to capture the conference title and compete for the national championship.
After winning the Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award for the first time on Sept. 2, Nwanebu has only gotten better. This week’s selection was her fifth of the season, tying her with teammate and fellow outside hitter sophomore Samantha Bricio for the most conference Freshman of the Week selections. The Women of Troy have now been awarded 11 such selections, good enough to hold the Pac-12 record (freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins also took home the honors once earlier this season).
Nwanebu will look to go for the all-time record this weekend when USC matches up against Pac-12 rivals Washington and Washington State. These road matches will test both Nwanebu and the rest of the squad -— the Huskies are currently ranked No. 3 in the nation and took the last match against the Women of Troy in four sets at the Galen Center. USC will look to avenge the loss and put itself in prime position to win the conference and accelerate into the NCAA tournament when the season concludes on Nov. 29.

With all that’s happened around the USC football program in the past year and a half, it’s at once surprising and to be expected that ESPN’s College GameDay is yet again coming to Los Angeles this Saturday when the Trojans take on Stanford in what will undoubtedly be the biggest game of the season.
The decision to host GameDay at USC is surprising given that this is a season in which USC fired its head coach, lost at home to Washington State and has had so many injuries and depth issues on its roster that it should be nearly impossible to have a successful season. But, believe it or not, the Trojans are having just that — an objectively successful season, or at least their “new season,” which is a term interim head coach Ed Orgeron has used to describe the time period since he took over for former head coach Lane Kiffin.
Under Orgeron, the Trojans are 4-1 overall and unbeaten in Pac-12 play, including two consecutive dominating road victories that have put USC in position to make a run at the Pac-12 South. This impressive stretch is why ESPN’s decision to host GameDay at USC is to be expected — USC looks like USC again, and people are starting to notice.
But even as recently as last season, GameDay chose to come to the USC-Notre Dame game despite USC’s 7-4 record at the time, suggesting that the Trojans could draw a crowd no matter how much they struggled. Sure, Notre Dame’s No. 1 ranking and eventual BCS National Championship Game berth had something to do with the decision, but even at its worst, USC could still capture the spotlight. Now, with a team that has risen from the ashes, USC is once again commanding the nation’s gaze, though this time more on its own terms.
During last year’s disappointment, GameDay arrived at a time when it almost seemed like the program didn’t want any attention. Kiffin’s hot seat was heating up, former quarterback Matt Barkley was injured and nobody in cardinal and gold wanted to have to watch the Irish celebrate on the Coliseum field as they capped off an unbeaten regular season.
This season, though, the Trojans are welcoming the attention. USC’s past two victories have been reminiscent of USC teams of the mid-2000s, a timeframe that represents the glory days just before the NCAA sanctions hit. Beating a good Oregon State team on the road by 17 was impressive, but putting up 62 points against a woeful California team is exactly what USC was supposed to do, and by doing that, the Trojans have reinvigorated a fanbase that has been aching for something to cheer about all season.
The highest attendance at the Coliseum this season so far was 77,823, roughly 15,000 less than capacity. This was at the Washington State game, the season’s home opener. Since then, attendance has failed to reach 65,000 in any of the team’s next four home games — against Boston College, Utah State, Arizona and Utah.
Of course, there were reasons why fans didn’t show up to these games. Against Boston College and Utah State, fans were not yet ready to watch a team that they recently saw lose to Washington State. Against Arizona, Kiffin’s firing and a Thursday night home game kept fans away. And for the Utah game, the Trojans had just lost to Notre Dame. And let’s face it — noon is just too early to start a football game.
This weekend, though, the conditions are perfect — kickoff is at 5 p.m., the team has won three in a row and coming into town is a Stanford team that hasn’t lost to USC since 2008. This will be the first time in more than two months that the team returns home coming off of a win. At the risk of jinxing the whole thing, come Saturday night, the Coliseum might feel (and sound) like the Coliseum again. Though it doesn’t garner as much attention as other big-name stadiums, few others are more imposing than a packed Coliseum — anybody who was at the 2011 USC-Stanford game can attest to that.
USC is a program that typically has thrived on the big stage — players come here because they want to be seen by as many eyes as possible. On Saturday, they’ll get their wish, because all eyes will be on the Coliseum to see what all the fuss is about.

USC returns home after two consecutive away games this week to host the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal. The Trojans (7-3, 4-2 Pac-12) look to end a streak of four straight losses to Stanford (8-1, 6-1 Pac-12), including a crushing 21-14 defeat last year in Palo Alto that ruined then-quarterback Matt Barkley’s Heisman Trophy chances and sent the Trojans plummeting down the Associated Press poll.
Rock steady · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler has been consistent this season, with 12 touchdowns and only six interceptions. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Scouting Stanford
The Cardinal enter this week’s matchup ranked No. 5 in the AP Poll and No. 4 in the BCS Standings after knocking off previously unbeaten Oregon last week.
Stanford’s offense is similar to USC’s, with playcalling split almost evenly between the pass and the run. Running back Tyler Gaffney paces the run game, averaging 116.78 yards per game, good for third in the Pac-12.
Quarterback Kevin Hogan hasn’t put up flashy numbers this season, but he has played consistently for the Cardinal, averaging 177.9 passing yards per game along with 25.89 rushing yards per game.
“He’s very dangerous,” USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron said of Hogan. “And you have to commit so many people for the run that can make the big play and you have to account for him in the running game.”
Hogan’s favorite target this season has been wide receiver Ty Montgomery. In addition to hauling in 71 receiving yards per game, Montgomery excels on special teams, leading the nation in average yards per kickoff return with 33.64.
Prep not hype
Before USC’s 2012 football season, the phrase “Prep not hype” became popular among the Trojans. It was painted on the sideline of the practice field as a reminder for the team to not get caught up in excitement of entering the season ranked No. 1 in the nation.
Following that year’s disastrous 7-6 campaign, it appears the phrase was not taken to heart. But it seems appropriate once again for the upcoming game against the Cardinal, as the Trojans are coming off a 62-28 blowout of the California Golden Bears. The 34-point margin of victory was the largest of USC’s season so far, extending the team’s winning streak to three games, another season high.
But Stanford will come to town with its own momentum as well, having just knocked off then-No. 2 Oregon, dashing the Ducks’ national championship hopes for the second consecutive year.
With all the excitement surrounding the game, Orgeron is faced with the task of balancing the prep and the hype.
“We want energy,” Orgeron said. “We’re gonna focus on the task at hand. I totally trust that [the players are] gonna follow the plan on a daily basis and we’ll be ready to play Saturday.”
Get up for GameDay
ESPN’s College GameDay program will travel to USC’s campus on Saturday, adding even more commotion to the matchup between the Trojans and the Cardinal.
USC has been featured on College GameDay at least once every year since 2003, and has posted a 15-7 record when it appears on the program, though the Trojans have lost in their last four appearances on the show.
This year, for the first time, the program will be filmed at McCarthy Quad instead of outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. ESPN’s Colin Cowherd will host his radio show on campus on Friday.
All of this buzz is bound to create a hostile atmosphere at the Coliseum on Saturday night, and Orgeron has a few words of advice for the Trojan faithful.
“Come early and support your players,” Orgeron said. “They need you, the coaching staff needs you. [The fans] mean the world to us. Come early and stay late.”

With Stanford looming on the schedule next week and California possessing a powerful passing attack, Saturday’s matchup between USC and the Golden Bears seemed like it might be a potential “trap game” for the Trojans. But an explosive first half that featured two punt returns for touchdowns from sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor quickly dispelled that notion, as USC (7-3, 4-2) rolled to a 62-28 victory over the hapless Bears (1-9, 0-7).
Before USC’s offense could get on the field,  Agholor set the tone for the Trojans by returning a punt 75 yards for a touchdown, USC’s first non-blocked punt return touchdown since 2010.
“I got under it with some space and got some blocks down the field,” Agholor said. “That’s how you return, when a lot of guys put in a lot of effort so one guy can run.”
He added another in the second quarter to tie a conference record, becoming the first USC player to accomplish the feat since Mike Garrett did against Cal in 1965. Redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw also returned a blocked punt for six points to give USC a NCAA record-tying three touchdowns off punt returns.
When the offense did get to match up against Cal’s defense, the latter unit showed just how much they miss former defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, who now holds the same title for the Trojans.
USC drove 79 yards in 15 plays before reaching paydirt on a slip screen pass from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler to senior tailback Silas Redd, who rumbled 12 yards into the end zone to make their lead 14-0.
That was just the beginning of a nearly flawless game for the Trojans that saw them brush off several of the bad habits that had hampered them throughout the season.
Overall, a unit that hadn’t been explosive most of the season seemed to find an extra gear in NorCal. The Trojans averaged 9.8 yards per play and had eight plays that gained more than 20 yards.
“That’s pretty good right there,” redshirt senior offensive tackle Kevin Graf said after hearing the team’s offensive statistics. “You feel really good, and you feel as an offensive line that you really did your job.”
Kessler was 14 of 17 for 170 yards and two touchdowns, with completions to eight different receivers. Redshirt sophomore Javorius “Buck” Allen had 135 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just six carries, and tacked on a 57-yard touchdown reception to continue his sudden emergence. Allen now leads the team in rushing touchdowns (7).
“I want to give credit to the line and the fullbacks because without them I wouldn’t even be in [this position],” Allen said. “We have a great offense and a great game plan and we executed.”
Agholor had 215 all-purpose yards, all of which came in the first half. Senior receiver De’Von Flournoy led USC in receiving yards (63) on three receptions.
Cal freshman quarterback Jared Goff performed admirably in defeat while carrying the Bears’ offense, completing 34 of 48 attempts for 255 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears were only outgained 499-483 offensively by the Trojans, but shoddy special teams play and a porous defense doomed them to their seventh Pac-12 loss and 14th consecutive defeat to FBS competition.
“I think they got a lot of talent on that offense,” redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard said. “They can get over the top on you and make plays in space. We just wanted to contain them all day and make them uncomfortable pass-rush wise.”
The only bad news of the day for USC came when Redd was sidelined for the remainder of the game with a minor right knee injury after his touchdown run. But Allen stepped right into his place and sparked the Trojans to another score on his first series in the backfield.
With a scamper reminiscent of his 52-yard score against Oregon State last week, Allen took an outside handoff down the right sideline and showed off a vicious cutback move before crossing the goal line to extend USC’s lead to 21 with just over a minute left in the first quarter.
After Cal responded with two touchdowns to cut the deficit to seven points, Allen caught another slip screen pass from Kessler on 2nd and 18 and ran 57 yards into the end zone to add to his impressive highlight reel.
The Bears’ ensuing possession resulted in a three-and-out, and Cole Leininger’s punt was blocked by sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku. The ball spun in the air before landing in the arms of junior cornerback Josh Shaw, who returned it 14 yards for a touchdown to make the score 35-14.
Leininger got off the punt on his next attempt following another stalled Bears drive, but Agholor returned it 93 yards for his second touchdown to make the score 41-14 and tie USC’s season-high point total with 3:47 still left in the first half.
The onslaught continued in the second half with a 79-yard dash from Allen, marking his second consecutive game with three touchdowns. Kessler and Allen were benched for the rest of the game to protect the star players from injury — but the second-stringers simply picked up where the starters left off.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek’s first pass attempt of the game resulted in a 26-yard completion to redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble. Freshman tailback Ty Isaac gained 18 yards on his first rushing attempt of the game, then punched it into the end zone on the next play for his first career touchdown and a 55-14 USC lead.
From there, the Trojans cruised to victory and gave hope to their fans that they might just have a chance to pull off an upset against Pac-12 frontrunner Stanford next Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“It shows how close these guys are getting as a family and focusing on the task at hand,” Orgeron said. “Because we all know what’s coming up next week.”

It can be a lonely world out there, especially when there’s no Wi-Fi. But sometimes, even with a secure Internet connection, digital life can be lonely.
Keeping in touch is presumably made easier with social media. With new social networks and apps constantly being added, however, it can be difficult to keep up with all of the platforms. Take Nextdoor, for example. This app is a private social network for you, your neighbors and your community. Through this app, you have the ability to talk to others around you and, as the app promises, be able to make the area around you better and safer.
As great as this all sounds, there’s just one problem: Not every single neighborhood uses it. Even the USC community — one that is filled with tech-savvy and proactive students — has not taken advantage of it. In total, there are roughly 30 students who are part of the social network in the surrounding area. It’s not a terribly small number, but for such a large student body, it’s strange how an idea such as this wouldn’t be more popular among millennials who are always ready to socialize.
Unfortunately, it’s an epidemic that plagues many apps and websites that want to be the next Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.
One app that might have the potential of becoming the next giant social network is Path. Founded by former Facebook employee Dave Morin, the app differentiates itself by limiting its users to an intimate 250 friends.
Despite the fact that Path has 20 million users, I feel extremely isolated within the app. And it’s not the friend limit that makes me feel this way. Rather, only a few of my friends use Path, and they aren’t all that active on it. I had come to use Path as a personal diary, but eventually ended up deleting the app altogether.
A larger user base itself is not always the key to a healthy and thriving social network. It can’t hurt, of course, but there’s more to these communities than just the numbers.
A social network should bring everyone involved closer together through similar interactions. Nextdoor has the right idea, but since it’s designed to send out alerts to entire communities and not just individuals, finding appropriate times to interact without being awkward or intrusive are rare.
On the other hand, there are a number of apps that bring strangers together through common motives and goals. Happier, for instance, is an app that wants to remind you of your happy times. The app not only works as a journal, but also a social network where you can share your own happy moments and view other people’s happy moments.
As a semi-pessimist, I wanted to hate this app instantly. Happy people posting about their happy moments? Ugh. But the more I used the app, the more I actually started feeling happier. And when I ventured on to interact with the community, I also felt happy for others who posted about moments such as successfully baking a pie or adopting a new puppy.
I never forged any meaningful relationships with anyone in the Happier community, but I felt like I had a sort of Happier support group backing me.
Everest, a similar type of self-improvement app, wants its users to set and attain short-term and long-term goals. Like Happier, you can choose to what degree you want to interact with the rest of the community. Is someone sticking to their promise to go running every day? Leave him or her an encouraging comment. Want to suggest challenges for people to take on? You’ll get at least a couple of positive responses.
Though it might be different depending on who you know, I find that that I know very few people who use these apps. And frankly, for me, that’s what makes these social networks stronger and more intriguing.
But how successful would an app be if the interactions between users were limited? Frontback is an app that splices selfies and forward-facing snapshots. It’s a simple idea, albeit a bit silly, but so far it has garnered hundreds of thousands of downloads. In terms of its social network aspect, users can only like other photos or follow others. There are no options for comments or messages, only captions.
Since the active audience using the app is still relatively small, the community feels cozy and inviting. The photos that show up on the newsfeed are a mixture of staff-picked and personal follows, which encourage people to like photos of completely random people and, through likes, participate in this selfie-adoring community.
But there really isn’t a specific formula for social networking — it’s mostly about luck, originality, and most of all, getting a headstart. Giant social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram became big because they crunched the numbers and laid down the code before others since, eventually, similar sites would’ve been created — regardless of whether or not Mark Zuckerberg endorsed them.
But what are other social network platforms and apps supposed to do when so much of the market is already satiated? If you are an aspiring app creator, you have to be realistic — it’ll be difficult for you to pull off the next Facebook. There’s a better market for niche social networks such as Tastemade, a foodie-friendly social video community, but if you’re looking to aggregate millions upon millions of active and devoted users, chances are, unfortunately, you won’t.

Controversy sells. It’s an unfortunate fact of life, one that is embodied by Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, better known by her stage name, Lady Gaga. The New York native has taken the old adage and fashioned a career out of it, and it seems there’s scarcely a person in the United States who can hear the name “Lady Gaga” without having some intense reaction of either love or hate.

And yet there’s a reason why Lady Gaga must, with each album release and each outlandish bubble dress, be considered relevant: Her music is catchy. She can sing her (constantly near-bared) a– off, and there’s no amount of mean Perez Hilton tweets that could detract from that. It’s inescapable, like Kanye West melting down at the MTV Video Music Awards and then subsequently releasing the masterful My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Unlike West, who challenged his listeners with his latest release, Yeezus, Lady Gaga is tending toward safer material on her latest album Artpop, which was released this week.
The album’s leading single, “Applause,” is an upbeat synth-pop track that captures a majority of the good things about Lady Gaga: catchy, staccato synth loops over ’80s pop-rock drums as Lady Gaga sings about how much she enjoys applause. But it’s better if listeners don’t pay any closer attention than that, because the lyrics occasionally drift into cringe-worthy territory. Some of her songwriting gems include: “I’ve overheard your theory / Nostalgia’s for geeks / I guess sir, if you say so / Some of us just like to read,” which might give Jay Z’s “I don’t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford” a run for its money for the Most Awkward Unrelated Reference award.
But nuanced songwriting was never really Lady Gaga’s strong suit — what Gaga sells is the persona of someone who’s “different,” which means there’s a rap track featuring T.I., Twista and Too $hort. On “Jewels & Drugs,” Gaga sings about how controversial she is on a whiplash-inducing synth and horn fest produced by DJ White Shadow. Though the track is inventively arranged (each rapper has a different backbeat to complement his delivery), Gaga’s tired lyrical themes of being different and controversial again sound worse for the wear — not to mention they come off as amateurish next to the likes of T.I., who sounds like he’s capable of rapping 16 bars of self-flattery in his sleep.
The album’s highlight is “Dope,” an impassioned song of redemption about Gaga’s struggle with marijuana addiction following her hip surgery. The Rick Rubin-produced ballad strips down instrumentation in favor of Gaga’s vulnerable vocals. Though the key restricts Gaga to an emotionally wooden low register, she works within her constraints to showcase a spellbinding vocal performance that crests near the end of the track into full-fledged screams. In every facet (besides, again, the songwriting), “Dope” is a sweeping, emotional track that could have been bigger with grander aspirations — if, that is, Gaga was willing to share something about her personal life beyond what the general public already seems to know.
This feeling of “looking for more” pervades Artpop. The LP’s cover art, which features Lady Gaga posing naked with her legs wrapped around the album title, is telling in two ways. On the one hand, it suggests that Gaga is undressing for her fans, that the album is personal and full of insight into who she is. And yet, who she is appears to be a staggeringly vapid, commercialized pop icon for adolescents and adoring fans who seek her affirmation for being “different.”
This would all be perfectly fine if the album was capable of pushing forward new ideas or forging ahead in different realms with pop music, which isn’t completely out of the question. But the songs that appear on Artpop sound like Gaga is pushing “different for different’s sake” more than ever. Gone is the iconoclast who spoke for a generation of “Little Monsters”; this is a Gaga who sounds corporately manufactured and stale. In following with this latter persona, Gaga entreated her “Little Monsters” via Twitter to purchase multiple copies of her single to help it top the iTunes charts.
So does controversy still sell? Of course. But in the case of Artpop, it’s becoming clear that Lady Gaga is no longer controversial.

her album seems greater than other out there, and if you writing about it means she still controversial. I love the whole album of it with the exception of Jewels and Drugs. Then all of it it’s good!
You completely missed the mark on this.

Lines of excited fans circled the blocks outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, some waiting since the early morning, for the 2nd Annual Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All Carnival presented by Camp Flog Gnaw. The area was flooded with a sea of teens sporting high socks and Supreme brand five-panel caps — a signature of any Odd Future event. The carnival catered to all types of crowds, from the hardcore punk kids, to the electronic dance music fans and a surprising number of moms hanging out in the beer garden while their 15-year-olds were in the mosh pit. It is no surprise that Odd Future’s music appeals to so many disparate tastes; their music has the ability to go from complete primal mayhem to deeply personal introspection and anywhere in between.

If someone who had never heard of Odd Future came to the carnival and saw the hoards of young kids buying up as many sky-blue “OF” backpacks, shirts, hoodies, socks, hats and even pillows as they could carry, he or she might write them off as corporate sell-outs in it for the money. But Odd Future is not your average group. While they might be around the same age as Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber, they don’t have famous parents and didn’t break onto the scene through agents and managers. They were simply a group of kids who put funny songs on the Internet and blew up. Their carnival certainly had the corporate sponsorships of any other large music festival, but it felt like a simple, childlike vision of combining the attractions of a carnival with the atmosphere of a hip-hop concert.
The first act to go on was Earl Sweatshirt, probably the least outrageous and most brooding member of Odd Future. He played a handful of songs from Doris, his newest and arguably darkest work. During breaks, he and DJ Taco made fun of an audience member who puked and imitated the surfer-bro voices of their fans. Sweatshirt finished with two upbeat tracks from his first mixtape that got him his start, “Earl” and “Drop”.
A highlight of the day was Flying Lotus. Considerably older than the other performers, Flying Lotus brought a level of musicality and maturity that one would expect from the great nephew of John and Alice Coltrane. He performed his DJ set as Flying Lotus behind a transparent veil onto which hypnotizing visuals were projected. He then came out from behind the veil and “morphed” into his rapping alter ego Captain Murphy to close the set.
This performance overshadowed some of the more mediocre acts such as Schoolboy Q and Mac Miller. Most of Schoolboy Q’s set consisted of unintelligible screaming over his original tracks. Mac Miller, a Pittsburgh emcee who was once a relatable, white, high school kid who rapped about eating yogurt also performed. His Flog Gnaw performance, however, was a far cry from his earlier image, as he mentioned killing his fans and rotting corpses in a transparent attempt to be dark and brooding.
During these uninspired acts on the main “High” stage, fans had the choice to venture down to the smaller “Camp” stage. The venue also featured a skate park, where competitions were held. At one point, a seemingly impromptu performance broke out featuring the entire Odd Future crew, leading to a mad rush to the stage. This is also where local punk/hardcore band Trash Talk played its set to a mob of moshing teenagers. At one point, Trash Talk lead singer Lee Spielman instructed the crowd to break down the fences and barriers. Security attempted to restrain concert-goers, but they were easily overpowered and forced into a corner as mayhem broke out.
The sight of this overthrow of authority was memorable, but the moment that will surely be talked about the most in the coming days happened during Tyler, the Creator’s set. He started by “getting ignorant for a second” and playing the ridiculously bombastic “B—h Suck D–k,” which toes the line between a genuine banger and an ironically bad criticism of some of his trap music contemporaries. He then got emotional, lamenting the confusion between love and hate with “IFHY” and attacking his absent father with his new song “Answer.”
The climax of the night came toward the end of Tyler’s set, when he brought out “the only famous person who can put up with [his] annoyingness,” Kanye West. The crowd instantly went crazy, as he was joined by Earl and Tyler joined West in performing “New Slaves.” It was surreal to see them all on stage together, and Tyler even recognized it in his usual manner, calling it “awkward and weird.” The OF crew then stepped back and watched while Kanye performed “Late.” The unsettling feelings multiplied as the whole crew came out, telling everyone to lose their minds, and played Tyler’s song “Tamale,” another raucous banger. All of the 19 to 22-year-olds flailed around on stage, screaming and throwing water on their fans, while Kanye calmly stood and nodded his head, too cool to join in the debauchery, yet appearing to approve of the energy.
After all of this craziness, the night was capped off with a mellow performance by crooner Frank Ocean. The Grammy nominee performed hits such as “Thinkin Bout You” and “Super Rich Kids” and then transitioned each piece with mellow instrumental segments. Backed by a full band, Ocean occasionally left the stage during a lush horn arrangement or guitar solo in order to give the instrumentalists their due.
For the timid crowd that spent more time on the ferris wheel than in the mosh pit, Frank’s impressive falsetto and laid-back R&B grooves were quite a departure from the earlier chaos. This wide range of genre is part of why Camp Flog Gnaw is a good bet for not only die-hard fans, but anyone remotely interested in hip-hop culture.

On Sunday, Nov. 3, Tim Bowers took his last breath.
The 32-year-old avid hunter was expecting a baby with his new wife when a hunting accident rendered him paralyzed, according to CBS News. While Bowers was hooked up to life support, doctors informed his family that he would need a ventilator to breathe for the rest of his life. At best, Bowers would be able to sit up, but life as he knew it would be over.
Bowers’ family decided to take him out of sedation to ask if he wanted to continue to live. His answer was no, so he was taken off of life support and died a few hours later.
Bowers’ decision to end his life has reignited the controversy surrounding the idea of euthanasia. Every few years, a case comes along that pits those holding out hope for a miracle against the skeptics, the faithful against the practical. Oftentimes, these cases see parents pitted against spouses, or children against step-parents. In 2005, Terri Schiavo died after a lengthy battle between her husband and her parents over whether or not to continue her life support. Schiavo was living as a “vegetable,” unable to move and receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. Her husband wanted to pull the plug while her parents fought in court to keep their daughter alive.
In Bower’s case, however, the decision was not left to his family. Instead, Bowers was in control and chose what he wanted to do — a right that every person in the United States should have.
The topic is certainly a hot-button issue that many feel passionately about. After all, a human life is involved. Many times, those who oppose euthanasia claim that people have “so much to live for!” or that “life shouldn’t be wasted.”  And while these are good points, it is imperative to remember that no one has the right to speak for another person. One cannot turn to the person next to them and declare that he or she should not be in control of his or her own life. When brain trauma is not a factor, the choice to live or die must be left to the individual.
Living the rest of life unable to move, breathe, talk or hold one’s child sounds like a daunting prospect. Of course, there are many people living with disabilities who enjoy life to the fullest every day. But then again, there are plenty of people who do not wish to experience life as such. To some, a life spent in a hospital, closed off from the outside world, doesn’t seem like a life at all.
In Mar Adentro, the 2004 film based on the life of quadriplegic Ramón Sampedro, Sampedro spends his days at the mercy of his friends and family, physically incapable of caring for himself in any way. Samperdo decides to fight for his right to euthanasia, and when asked why, he replies: “I want to die because I feel that a life for me in this state has no dignity. I understand that other quadriplegics may take offense to my saying there’s no dignity in this, but I’m not trying to judge anyone. Who am I to judge those who choose life? So don’t judge me or anyone who wants to help me die.”
Sampedro ultimately found a way to die with the help of his friends and family, ingeniously devising a plan that would keep them safe from any legal repercussions. But Sampedro should not have had to fight for his right. He saw his disability as a cage, a reminder of a life that he would never be able to fully enjoy.
Life is a gift and people should use it as they wish. If a person chooses to spend his or her life hooked up to a ventilator or in a wheelchair, their wishes should be granted. But it is not the legal system’s job to force someone to live that way as well.
Society needs to realize that it is never appropriate to tell any person how to live his or her life. Everyone should have the ability to choose the right path for themselves — even when that choice is between life or death.

Last Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration made an unprecedented move to eliminate artery-clogging artificial trans fats from America’s food supply. According to the Wall Street Journal, the final ruling by the FDA will not go into effect until after a 60-day comment period, but the movement is nonetheless a step forward. Though the prevalence of trans fats has been reduced over the years, banning them for good will not only be healthy for the nation as a whole, but will also open the door to eliminating other nutritional issues.
Victoria Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
Trans fats are everywhere, from margarines and shortenings to salad dressing, cookies and chips. A slow poison in need of urgent attention, trans fat has been associated with inflammation, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Introduced after the development of the hydrogenation process in the early 20th century, trans fat became a mainstay of the American diet, according to a 2010 review in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The infamous “ingredient” puts the crisp in French fries.
And though the FDA has already taken measures to reduce trans fats in American diets, none of those measures have been as impactful as a full-out ban. In the coming years, it will help prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths, the FDA said.
As always, there are critics. Opponents decry this proposal as an example of government intrusion on citizens’ rights. For example, one online commenter wrote on a New York Times article, “The FDA should stay out of peoples lives … and stop trying to control what we do and what we eat. If I want to clog my arteries … I should have the right to do that without some hack government bureaucracy like the FDA controlling our lives.”
First of all, the health of American citizens is very much intertwined with the government, especially under the Affordable Care Act. If food products are unhealthy or unsafe in any way, it is the government’s responsibility to act in the interest of the consumer. It seems that these critics have not fully grasped the danger of trans fats.
There is also an expensive price tag attached to the health effects of an individual’s diet, which concerns the government and fellow citizens. Cardiovascular diseases — including strokes, coronary heart disease, hypertensive disease and heart failure — cost the U.S. a staggering $444 billion in 2010, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Other ailments are still on the horizon, as a result of supersized portions and saturated fat. These problem areas should be tackled next, and it is this ban that seems to be the first step in doing this. In a few decades, the United States will hopefully start to look  more like Denmark, which became the first country in 2003 to introduce laws to strictly regulate the sale of foods containing trans fats.
Regulating the use of trans fats is just another way that the U.S. government can protect its citizens.

And there we go…Liberty reduced to dollars and cents. I guess every great civilization ends some time. May I be the first to introduce (drumroll..) CALORIE CREDITS! Buy yours today and do your part to reduce your medical care footprint! I wonder which medications will be first to be banned in the name of healthcare savings? Of course high-calorie foods and sodas will be first, but just wait. Some socialist politician will need to reduce the deficit in twenty years.He or she will use the handy dandy ACA…and pooof! Grandmas heart meds (yes monkeys people will still get heart disease post trans-fats) are illegal. Oh well, at least we can light up a perfectly legal joint while the ship sinks…

On Saturday actress Lisa Kudrow hosted a conversation with veteran director James Burrows. Burrows — who’s earned 10 Emmys, four Directors Guild Awards and a spot in the TV Academy Hall of Fame — received the Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Masters Award for Comedy during this year’s Comedy@SCA Festival.
Burrows has a long list of directorial credits to his name including The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Cheers, Will & Grace and Friends. His more recent credits include directing episodes of The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men and Mike & Molly.
Both Burrows and Kudrow received scholarship funds in their name through the Okie Foundation. The “Humor is 90 Percent Surprise” award will be given in honor of Burrows and the “Just Stay With it and Keep Working” in honor of Kudrow.  The scholarships will be given to USC School of Cinematic Arts students starting next year.
Kudrow spoke of Burrows’ ability to foster familial relationships and creativity. While shooting the first season, Burrows said he took the six Friends cast members to Las Vegas.
“I said, ‘This is your last shot at anonymity,’ because the show hadn’t been on the air yet and I wanted them to bond. I wanted them to love one another,” he said. “I wanted them to, if another director came in, have the guts to say, ‘I think for me it would be better if it went this way.’ I knew they were all creative and that would only make the show better.”
But according to Kudrow, Burrows’ generosity extended both on and off set. He gave up his dressing room — which was larger than the actors’ — to the cast so they could play poker.
“For the actors you create this playground during rehearsal. It’s a very productive rehearsal, and you encourage those who are willing to pitch jokes. You make it really fun and it feels really collaborative,” Kudrow said. “Thanks for the money you fronted us to gamble.”
Though Burrow’s ability to direct comedic television might not have changed much over the years, he said the business of television has. With the rise of cable television and networks such as HBO and Showtime, Burrow said there are more shows on television and comedy writers working at the networks are no longer necessarily the best comedy writers.
“With the amount of shows being done now — most of them are not any good,” he said. “But there are maybe 10 shows that are really good, which is probably the same as what it was in the ’70s when there were just three networks.”
The volume of shows is not the only thing that’s changed, Burrows said. Starting in the 1990s when Burrows worked on Friends and Will & Grace, networks began to meddle with the plots, claiming that Will & Grace had too many gay jokes and that Monica — one of the Friends — shouldn’t sleep with someone on a first date, as she did in the pilot. Kudrow said that on the night of the pilot taping they did a survey and the audience approved of the plotline.
“[The network] didn’t really trust that [writer/creator] David [Crane] and Marta [Kauffman] knew what they were writing about or new the people they were writing about and the network didn’t trust that the audience were the same people,” Kudrow said. “They also wanted an adult on Friends because there hadn’t been a show with just 20-somethings and who’s going to watch that or be interested in those people?”
The importance of being innovative and persistent was a key takeaway for students who came to the event.
“These two are both very important people in our field and I think the important thing they said was just keep at it,” said Thomas Truax, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television.
David Himelfarb, executive producer of My Wife and Kids and Kyle XY, said he came to the event to see the legendary Burrows, but was excited to see so many eager students.
“It’s a business in which training and knowledge is passed on a verbal basis,” Himelfarb said. “There’s a living tree of memories and tradition and ideas and thoughts that are passed along and that’s how the business grows.”
Ultimately, Burrows said the most important thing is to have fun with what you’re doing.
“I tell actors, ‘Check your ego at the door,’” he said. “I have a fun clause in my contract.”

With Stanford looming on the schedule next week and California possessing a powerful passing attack, Saturday’s matchup between USC and the Golden Bears seemed like it might be a potential “trap game” for the Trojans. But an explosive first half that featured two punt returns for touchdowns from sophomore wideout Nelson Agholor quickly dispelled that notion, as USC (7-3, 4-2) rolled to a 62-28 victory over the hapless Bears (1-9, 0-7).
Before USC’s offense could get on the field,  Agholor set the tone for the Trojans by returning a punt 75 yards for a touchdown, USC’s first non-blocked punt return touchdown since 2010.
“I got under it with some space and got some blocks down the field,” Agholor said. “That’s how you return, when a lot of guys put in a lot of effort so one guy can run.”
He added another in the second quarter to tie a conference record, becoming the first USC player to accomplish the feat since Mike Garrett did against Cal in 1965. Redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw also returned a blocked punt for six points to give USC a NCAA record-tying three touchdowns off punt returns.
When the offense did get to match up against Cal’s defense, the latter unit showed just how much they miss former defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, who now holds the same title for USC.
The Trojans drove 79 yards in 15 plays before reaching paydirt on a slip screen pass from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler to senior tailback Silas Redd, who rumbled 12 yards into the end zone to make their lead 14-0.
That was just the beginning of a nearly flawless game for the Trojans that saw them brush off several of the poor habits that had hampered them throughout the season.
USC’s offense hadn’t exactly came into the game having converted just 30.3 percent of its third-down conversions – tied for 114th in the FBS. But the Trojans greatly outperformed that mark against the Bears, succeeding on their first four attempts and finishing 5 for 9.
Overall, a unit that hadn’t been explosive most of the season seemed to find an extra gear in NorCal. The Trojans averaged 9.8 yards per play and had eight plays that gained more than 20 yards.
“That’s pretty good right there,” Graf said, grinning after hearing the team’s offensive statistics. “You feel really good, and you feel as an offensive line that you really did your job.”
Kessler was 14 of 17 for 170 yards and two touchdowns, with completions to eight different receivers. Redshirt sophomore Javorius “Buck” Allen had 135 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just six carries, and tacked on a 57-yard touchdown reception to continue his sudden emergence. Allen now leads the team in rushing touchdowns (7).
“I want to give credit to the line and the fullbacks because without them I wouldn’t even be in [this position],” Allen said. “We have a great offense and a great game plan and we executed.”
Agholor had 215 all-purpose yards, all of which came in the first half. Senior receiver De’Von Flournoy led USC in receiving yards (63) on three receptions.
Cal freshman quarterback Jared Goff performed admirably in defeat while carrying the Bears’ offense, completing 34 of 48 attempts for 255 yards and three touchdowns. The Bears were only outgained 499-483 offensively by the Trojans, but shoddy special teams play and a porous defense doomed them to their seventh Pac-12 loss and 14th consecutive defeat to FBS competition.
“I think they got a lot of talent on that offense,” redshirt senior linebacker Devon Kennard said. “They can get over the top on you and make plays in space. We just wanted to contain them all day and make them uncomfortable pass-rush wise.”
The only bad news of the day for USC came when Redd was sidelined for the remainder of the game with a minor right knee injury after his touchdown run. But Allen stepped right into his place and sparked the Trojans to another score on his first series in the backfield.
With a scamper reminiscent of his 52-yard score against Oregon State last week, Allen took an outside handoff down the right sideline and showed off a vicious cutback move before crossing the goal line to extend USC’s lead to 21 with just over a minute left in the first quarter.
After Cal responded with two touchdowns to cut the deficit to seven points, Allen caught another slip screen pass from Kessler on 2nd and 18 and ran 57 yards into the end zone to add to his impressive highlight reel.
The Bears’ ensuing possession resulted in a three-and-out, and Cole Leininger’s punt was blocked by sophomore fullback Soma Vainuku. The ball spun in the air before landing in the arms of junior cornerback Josh Shaw, who returned it 14 yards for a touchdown to make the score 35-14.
Leininger got off the punt on his next attempt following another stalled Bears drive, but Agholor returned it 93 yards for his second touchdown to make the score 41-14 and tie USC’s season-high point total with 3:47 still left in the first half.
“You return one and everyone wants to return another,” Agholor said. “Those guys blocked well and we were able to make the play.”
The onslaught continued in the second half with a 79-yard dash from Allen, marking his second consecutive game with three touchdowns. Kessler and Allen were benched for the rest of the game to protect the star players from injury – but the second-stringers simply picked up where the starters left off.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Max Wittek’s first pass attempt of the game resulted in a 26-yard completion to redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble. Freshman tailback Ty Isaac gained 18 yards on his first rushing attempt of the game, then punched it into the end zone on the next play for his first career touchdown and a 55-14 USC lead.
From there, the Trojans cruised to victory and gave hope to their fans that they might just have a chance to pull off an upset against Pac-12 frontrunner Stanford next Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“It shows how close these guys are getting as a family and focusing on the task at hand,” Orgeron said. “Because we all know what’s coming up next week.”
