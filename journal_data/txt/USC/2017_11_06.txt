A screenshot from the petition on change.org
Seven School of Cinematic Arts students have penned a petition asking USC to formally remove director Bryan Singer’s name from the institution on Monday. At the time of publication, the online petition had over 900 signatures, which included students and alumni.
The petition cites former accusations of sexual harassment, pedophilia and sexual assault against Singer, for whom the Division of Cinema and Media Studies is named.
“By continuing to associate Mr. Singer’s name with our University, USC is openly supporting a man who has been publicly accused of reprehensible sexual misconduct,” the petition said.  “As USC students and alumni, we hold ourselves to a standard of respect, and the SCA administration’s actions are not representative of that standard.”
Emily Halaka and Adrian Vega-Albela Osorio, two co-writers of the petition, hoped to foster dialogue about sexual assault and harassment at SCA. 
“We hope that the petition inspires more students to stand up for what we know is right, and inspires the SCA administration to make a change,” Halaka and Vega-Albela Osorio said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “As young filmmakers, we refuse to allow our futures to be permeated by power abuse. We refuse to sit quietly as harassment and assault continues around us.”
Singer has faced multiple lawsuits throughout his filmmaking career, including one in 1997 concerning child nudity on a film set, according to Entertainment Weekly. In 2014, Singer also faced allegations of sexually abusing a minor, according to court documents obtained by The Wrap. 
However, lawsuits against Singer have mostly been dismissed before an official trial. 
“We have known about the allegations against Singer for some time, as have many students — 20-plus years of media coverage on the multiple allegations against Singer have made his history a highly public topic,” Halaka and Vega-Albela Osorio wrote. “We hope that we, the student body of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, can continue to be an example for future generations entering the film industry, making changes little by little.”
In a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan, SCA spokesperson Kristin Borella responded to the petition.
“We are aware of the Change.org petition and appreciate the concerns of our students and alumni,” Borella said. “We want to assure them that we are taking this matter very seriously and are monitoring the situation.”
 
EDITOR’S NOTE: This post has been updated to reflect SCA’s statement on the student petition.
What kind of 3rd world trial by twitter fascist country is this turning into where people accused of things without trial or conviction are guilty in the eyes of twitter trolls?  This is madness! and it has to stop.  It’s Salem Witch trial and McCarthyism all over again.  Enough!
Can we please have Kegan Allee removed from campus, since she is on the record for reading books involving deviant pornography? Thanks in advance.
Suddenly reading pornography that *you* consider deviant is just as bad as sexual assault? Cool.
Given the definition of sexual assault these days, the answer is yes. “…works that explored extremely dangerous sexual undertakings which included pedophilia, necrophilia, sadomasochism and even bestiality.” Sounds deviant by anybody’s standards to me.

Former President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou spoke to an audience of students, faculty and international press at Town and Gown on Monday. Photo by Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
Over 500 guests, ranging from students to members of the international press, crowded into Town and Gown Monday afternoon to see Ma Ying-jeou, the former president of Taiwan, speak at an event hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy.
Ma spoke mainly about the country’s relationship with China, along with the rising power of that country.
CPD Director Jay Wang opened the event by highlighting the importance of diplomacy in politics, especially in  what he calls “volatile and dynamic regions.”
After Wang, USC President C. L. Max Nikias introduced Ma, calling him a strategic thinker who “showed a special skill for listening.”
“20 years ago, our special guest was a rising star on the world stage — an optimistic mayor with a bold, dynamic vision,” Nikias said. “As he grew, so would Taipei. The Taiwanese also took notice, electing him president in 2008 and re-electing him four years later.”
Ma then spoke, stressing the importance of strengthening mutually beneficial relations between Taiwan and its neighboring countries.
“We are caught in the crosshairs of great power, between powerful nations,” Ma said. “The U.S. and China, the emerging power, which places Taiwan directly in the middle.”
Ma also said that when he took office, Taiwan’s relationship with the United States was at its lowest point. He said he worked to restore bilateral trust.
“My strategy was simple,” Ma said. “Build a peaceful relationship with mainland China, Japan and the U.S.”
During his presidency, Ma signed over 20 treaties with China in an effort to maintain a good relationship with the country.
However, Ma said the peaceful and prosperous status quo he worked so hard to maintain for eight years began to crumble after his administration ended. He described the time after his administration as a “cold winter.”
Willow Bay, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, moderated a discussion with Ma, asking him questions about his opinions on the “One China” policy, a policy that states that there is only one China — and that Taiwan is within it.
Ma remained optimistic about the future of Taiwan and China, explaining the necessity of maintaining peaceful relations between the two countries.
“The more [cultural] exchange [with China], the better,” Ma said. “Just to learn of each other.” 
The conversation with Ma ended with questions from the audience. When asked about building a better future, Ma said exchange and study abroad programs for students were important to widen global and cultural perspectives.
Some students in attendance said they were grateful for the opportunity to attend this talk and get in touch with their cultural roots.
“He was funny and charismatic,” said Grace Kim, a sophomore majoring in communication who is Taiwanese-American. “It was cool for me to learn more about Taiwanese politics firsthand.”
Jared Yamasaki, a junior majoring in neuroscience, said he enjoyed Ma’s talk.
“I respect him so much more now that I’ve seen how he interacts, laughs with and talks to people like me,” Yamasaki said.

A candlelight vigil was held at the University Religious Center to honor those affected by a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex. Photo by Chris Chou | Daily Trojan
Just one month after hosting a vigil following a mass shooting in Las Vegas, members of the USC community again gathered under the same roof on Monday to mourn the 26 killed and over 20 injured in Sunday’s church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex., as of Monday night.
Three dozen USC students, staff and community members, holding candles that shined brightly throughout the vigil, gathered in Office of Religious Life’s courtyard for a ceremony that began just before sunset. 
The vigil was held to give the community a place to meditate in “an interfaith expression of solidarity with all those affected by the tragedy,” according to the invite post from the office.
Those in attendance remembered the lives lost after suspect Devin Patrick Kelley shot church-goers in a rural Texas town on Sunday.
“My hope is that none of us are comfortable with this,” said Varun Soni, the dean of religious life. “I hope we don’t let this define us as a country. I hope we don’t just comfort the afflicted, we afflict the comfortable.” 
Referencing to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Denver movie theater attack, the Orlando nightclub massacre and the Las Vegas concert shooting, Soni expressed his hope for political action. 
Reverend Jim Burklo, the senior associate dean of religious life, took note of the striking similarity the vigil had with the Las Vegas vigil, held after the Oct. 2 shooting. Burklo said it was important to hold a ceremony for this attack because of something an undergraduate student said to him last month at the Las Vegas vigil. Burklo said the student told him she came to the vigil because she had to do something out of her routine to mark the significance of the day. 
“Too many people treated today like it was a normal day,” Burklo said. “We need to do something to mark this is not normal. That’s why I came today, and that’s why you all came.” 
Burklo offered a message of empowerment and told the community it will take individual action from everyone to bring about change. 
“Guns do not cast fear,” Burklo said. “New laws might help, but they alone do not cast fear. It’s going to take something from within all of us to cast out the fear that comes in times like this.”
Community members from Texas offered their prayers and thanks to those who came to show their support. Bekah Estrada, a Christian life intern and Kilgore chapel coordinator, said she grew up in a small town in Texas and that the pictures from Sutherland Springs looked eerily familiar.
“I hope we respond not in fear, but that we respond in love,” Estrada said. 
The ceremony concluded with Burklo offering a prayer for all the victims around the country and the world who were affected, calling for political action and a “bell of prayer through all faiths.”

Sophomore setter Cindy Marina records a dig against Arizona on Friday night. Photo by Kaan Demiroz | Daily Trojan
The women’s volleyball team earned two victories over the weekend at the Galen Center, defeating Arizona State 3-1 on Friday before edging out Arizona 3-2 in a five-set thriller on Sunday.
USC took charge early against the Sun Devils to kick off the weekend, as the team won the first set 25-20 behind senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie’s five kills. Despite jumping out to a 7-2 lead in the second set, the Trojans could not hold on to the lead as Arizona State stormed back to tie things up with a 25-21 win. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who returned for the Women of Troy after missing the past four games, paced her team with eight kills in the second set.
But the Trojans rushed out to an early lead in the third frame and never looked back, winning 25-19. USC clinched the victory in a tight fourth set that saw nine tied scores and six lead changes. The Women of Troy used a 5-0 run to end the set and the match with a 25-18 victory. 
Lanier’s 20 kills spearheaded the Trojan attack against ASU, while Abercrombie and freshman opposite hitter Brooke Botkin contributed a combined 20 kills. Setters senior Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore Cindy Marina also combined for 43 assists in setting up attack opportunities. The Trojans were able to limit Arizona State’s Oluoma Okaro, who averaged 4.48 kills per set, to just 11 kills and 12 errors across four sets.
Two days later, USC emerged victorious in a slugfest against the Wildcats. Neither team could assert itself in a tight first set, but Botkin came through for USC, striking for three kills towards the end of the game to lift her team to a 25-20 set win. But Arizona rallied quickly, turning the tables in consecutive sets to put the Women of Troy in a 2-1 hole.
The Wildcats overcame a deficit to take a late lead in the fourth set, but this time, USC fought back with a 5-1 run to tie things up with a 25-22 win. In the final set, the Trojans rode their momentum to a fast start, and despite errors that allowed the Wildcats to draw within two points, the Trojans secured the match with a 15-11 victory in the final set.
Head coach Mick Haley was relieved to come away with a 2-0 weekend but was concerned with his team’s sloppy play.
“It felt like we might’ve gotten the win, but lost the match because [we] didn’t play at the level [we] expected,” Haley said. “At this point of the season in November, you have to understand that you have to fight for everything.”
The Women of Troy relied on a balanced team effort against Arizona: Lanier led the way with 16 kills, while Abercrombie, Botkin and senior opposite hitter Niki Withers each had 11 kills. Senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn helped with eight kills and seven blocks, and Meyer-Whalley and Marina provided 24 and 28 assists, respectively. But the team also committed 24 errors and 14 service errors.
“If this is our down period, then we’ll take it,” Haley said. “We got two wins this weekend — that was the goal. We’re still constantly trying to get better, but sometimes you just have to take the wins. We should be happy with that. We should be proud of that.”
With the two wins, USC now stands at 18-7 on the season, including a 10-4 mark in the Pac-12. This week, the Women of Troy welcome Utah and Colorado to the Galen Center, as the Utes visit on Thursday and the Buffaloes on Saturday.

Senior goalie McQuin Baron and the Trojans look to put their loss to Cal behind them quickly as they face No. 3 UCLA this week. Photo by Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
In a tough repeat of last year’s NCAA Championship, the top-ranked men’s water polo team lost to No. 2 Cal after a closely fought battle in Berkeley, Calif., on Saturday. The match went down to the final quarter, but it was the Golden Bears who ultimately prevailed, 6-3.
Having focused on defensive preparation throughout the season, the Trojans started off strong as senior goalie McQuin Baron tallied five saves to begin the match. Building from the strong defense, senior utility James Walters pushed forward and scored the opening goal — the only score of the first quarter.
Entering the second, the Trojans had momentum, but Cal’s defense shut them out throughout the period. The Bears were also able to figure out a way to get past Baron and USC’s defense. By halftime, the Trojans found themselves down 3-1.
USC looked like it was returning to form to open the third quarter, as sophomore 2-meter Matt Maier put a shot away to pull the Trojans within one. As Baron held the fort defensively, junior driver Zach D’Sa tied things up halfway through the period. But with seconds left in the third, Cal was able to fire another shot past Baron, giving the Bears the lead once again heading into the final quarter.
Their momentum continued into the fourth as Cal broke down USC’s defense. The Bears took advantage of a Baron ejection to extend their lead to 5-3, and none of USC’s shots hit their mark as the Trojans came up empty for the entirety of the quarter. Cal scored once more to finish USC off, maintaining its perfect home record this season. 
While a frustrating game for the Trojans, the team found a silver lining this weekend when it traveled to No. 5 Pacific on Sunday and clinched an 11-7 victory. Baron tallied 15 total saves at Cal, and he needed only one more against the Tigers to reach 1,000 career saves. He claimed 15 more to blow past the mark: It was only fitting Baron accomplished the feat against Pacific, considering the only other player in MPSF history who managed to tally 1,000 career saves was former Tiger Alex Malkis, who played from 2010 to 2013.
Even though they ended on a positive note this weekend, the Trojans will still look to rebound in pursuit of a national championship. Next up, USC readies for a trip to Westwood on Saturday to face crosstown rival No. 3 UCLA in the Trojans’ regular-season finale.

Angel Viscarra | Daily Trojan
In the blink of an eye, college basketball season has once again returned. And while fans of the college game and commentators across the nation have bought into the hype for this year’s USC men’s basketball team, there’s still no surety in saying the Trojan student body has done the same.
USC will open the 2017-18 regular season as the No. 10 team in the nation. This is the program’s highest preseason ranking in more than four decades, and also the highest ranking for the team since 1992, when USC finished the season ranked eighth nationally.
The hype for this season’s squad is palpable. Coming off of a program-record 26 wins last season — which saw the Trojans win two NCAA Tournament games for the first time since 2007 — many feel this USC team has the potential to compete with the nation’s elite. It finished just one win away from a Sweet 16 berth in last year’s tournament, dropping an 82-78 heartbreaker to Baylor.
The depth the Trojans will bring back from last year’s team is what has followers of the program most optimistic. USC’s top eight scorers from last season are returning, including the Trojans’ veteran nucleus of senior guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart and junior forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu. 
While today’s standard in college basketball is to leave a program after one year as a top NBA prospect, this Trojan basketball team is about as veteran-heavy as there is in the nation. In addition to its upperclassman leaders, USC has promising youth that look ready to contribute immediately in the coming season. Sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton put together a promising freshman campaign that saw him earn an All-Pac-12 Defensive Team Honorable Mention. The Trojans also look to receive key contributions from redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton, who transferred from Duke last year, and true freshman wing Jordan Usher. 
But while USC has caught the eye of many on paper, the Trojans still have other contributing factors on their own campus that may slow down the hype train.
The USC football team is currently ranked at No. 15. At 8-2 overall this season, the Trojans are primed to make a run for a Pac-12 Championship, which the program has not won since 2009. USC is one of only four schools nationally to currently have both its men’s basketball and football teams ranked in the top 25 (Miami, Michigan State and Notre Dame are the others). 
As the football team wraps up its regular season, likely plays in the Pac-12 Championship and qualifies for a bowl game in the coming weeks, the men’s basketball team will be playing its non-conference schedule. USC basketball will inevitably be the white noise playing softly in the background as the football team wraps up its 2017 campaign. 
USC’s non-conference schedule will begin this Friday night with a home contest against Cal State Fullerton and will run through Dec. 25. The Trojans open conference play against Washington at the Galen Center on Dec. 29. By then, USC football will be nearing the end of postseason play. 
When classes resume for the spring semester on Jan. 8, rest assured that the campus spotlight will finally be adjusted on this basketball team. If the Trojans can replicate the non-conference effort they gave last season (they reeled off 13 straight wins to open the campaign), then the hype train will pick up speed. 
It will be interesting to see if the Trojans’ early excitement this season will translate to higher turnouts at the Galen Center. USC’s home arena has a maximum capacity of 10,258, but the Trojans averaged 4,625 fans per home game last year. If the Trojans are still ranked within the top 15 when the spring semester commences, I’d expect this number to grow. 
When it comes to preseason rankings and projections, players and coaches alike are pretty hushed and private in their discussions. However, it’s no secret that the Trojans’ battle for relevance will begin on their own campus.

In caring about creating gorgeous, lo-fi visual aesthetics as well as meticulous songcraft, Mk.Gee creates an immersive music experience for listeners. After releasing two singles which have accumulated over 340,000 streams on Spotify and SoundCloud, he has spent time touring with fellow indie-pop singer Baum, and working on his new EP, set for release in March 2018. 
The Daily Trojan interviewed Gordon to learn more about his music career and future endeavors. 
Daily Trojan: How did you get your start in music?
Michael Gordon: I started playing piano when I was 6, and then I switched to guitar when I was 11. I’ve always had a passion for writing from the start, and music has been a part of my life forever.
DT: Tell us about your sound.
MG: I grew up on a lot of jazz and there are a lot of amazing colors that can come out of that. The whole genre is about experimentation and honesty, which I push for a lot. I have an extensive passion for funk and old R&B and guitarists like David T. Walker and other prime ’70s funk core musicians. I like the way it makes people feel. I grew up right next to the beach so I like the experimentation with … not lo-fi, but DIY production people. I’ve always been drawn to people with creative control and what they do with it. This project right now is a cross between my love for R&B and my love for indie production. I always push for going outside the box. There’s no point in doing something that’s already been done. I feel like people are longing for something really different — and so am I.

DT: Where does your creative process start?
MG: I usually start building a track, kind of like how hip-hop producers work, where you bring in a track and then you bring in this one person who top lines over it and brings in a melody and a song over it. Usually I just write songs with me and my guitar, and it’s usually a melody and chords first.
DT: What’s your favorite part of the music process — writing, producing or performing?
MG: Right now, it’s so comfortable for me to write and produce in my room. I could literally do it for 10 hours a day and I wouldn’t have any problem with it. There’s just two different sides of the game. I love performing as well — it takes a different mindset. I think it comes in circles for artists. You’re like, “I love live performing right now,” and you start getting into a groove of just nailing shows and then the same thing happens with production.
DT: How do you get “in the zone” to be creative?
MG: For writing, it happens in a lot of places, but for production, it’s my room. With production, it’s always about being in a spot where you can get around easily. If I have an idea, I can build on it. Writing is different; you’re inspired by what’s around you, so being in new places usually helps.
DT: What are you working on right now?
MG: I’m finishing up my EP that’s going to be released in about March. Everything is pretty much complete in terms of the tracklist and artwork. Right now, I’m in the mixing and mastering process, which takes a while. Now, it’s just about living with the songs enough so you can let it breathe and come back to it and see it with a different perspective. I like to be in control of what’s happening with mixing and stuff and I don’t send it off to other people to mix, so I usually wait about a month or so before I come back to the track.
DT: So you’re deeply involved with every step of the songwriting process?
MG: Definitely, I try to be. I don’t view it as a selfish thing; a lot of people do. I want to be creating every part of the track. If there’s something I can’t do, I’ll call on someone else who can do it better. My intent is not to be selfish, but I see the outcome and I know how to get the outcome.

DT: Would you call yourself a perfectionist?
MG: Definitely. There’s art in imperfection, but you have to find that line. I’m somewhere between imperfection and perfection.
DT: Who are your musical influences?
MG: Anything that makes me feel something, I usually pull from. It’s so long, but I’ll give you a few that inspired me a lot for this project — Bibio, Andy Shauf, Steve Lacey, Kindness, Kevin Parker, Homeshake … I could literally go for so long. Whatever you create is just an extension of who you are and to say I only have a handful of music that I draw from is kind of limiting.
DT: I see that you have videos that embody the vibe of the song to accompany your singles. Will we see visuals on your next project?
MG: Yes, definitely. I do a lot of photography. With music, there’s good aesthetic and bad aesthetic, and anything to add to that aesthetic is like, “Why not?” I write to pictures a lot just so I can have more of a story and a feeling of that picture and time. The “Unaware” video was about a year’s worth of footage — it was a trip to put it together. I got it developed last winter and I wrote “Unaware” with the visuals. I’ll definitely be incorporating visuals, it adds to the art.
DT: Are the two singles you have out now representative of the EP?
MG: Yes, it’s close. I think there’s a lot that it pulls from. The single I’m releasing on [Nov. 17] is a little different from my other two, so people can’t pinpoint my sound yet. It’s very similar, but soundscape-wise, it’s not as wet-sounding. It’s warm but not as dreamy-sounding, like “Unaware.” It’s hard to explain. I’m trying to do a two-sided EP. It’s about soundtracking someone’s Friday. There’s going to be a day side and a night side. So from Track 1 to Track 9 will be from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. There’s a story I want you to be placed in a setting, not just with the lyrics but [also] within the soundscape. I want the person to be transported to that time of day and that feeling that time of day brings.
DT: Do you have any upcoming shows?
MG: I have a show on Nov. 17. I like the feeling of having a really intimate concert, like a house party kind of thing. Me and my buddies built a stage in my backyard and we’re going to have a concert the same day of my single release. I think we’re going to be playing around 10 p.m.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
I’ve reached a point in the semester where I feel all inspiration has hit the sh-tter. Surely I’m not alone, so even though I can feel myself slipping into an abyss of regret and contrition, I feel slightly less lonely in my current downfall.
It sounds more bleak than it is, however. I know myself well enough to understand when and why these feelings, which take a blow at my productivity, arise. It happens more often than I would care for. And because my creative output is a direct result of my current mental state, the waves in which my thoughts flow can cause either an abundance of material, or an amplitude of nothingness.
Unfortunately, I currently seem to be face-to-face with the latter. In the last week, I’ve missed deadlines. I’ve turned in assignments late. I’ve walked into class wearing last night’s joggers and oversized T-shirts. It’s as unpromising as it sounds, yet I know myself well enough that I can sense when these feelings of insipidness will strike next. It’s like a sixth sense — and my halted work ethic seems to be my ghost.
Additionally, I also know that in these moments of creative desperation, I almost exclusively turn to opera. But lately, opera hasn’t been cutting it, which makes me believe that this slump is different from others. Opera has always been my salvation — it’s always been what I turn to in times of despair, exasperation and even elation. So what do I do when the sole material that satisfies my creative drought suddenly leaves me feeling unfulfilled?
I go across the street, from the opera house to the concert hall.
Though I have a proclivity for the operatic arts, I’ve also maintained a love of orchestral works. My knowledge may not be nearly as advanced, but for every five operas I listen to, I try to get at least one concerto or simfonia in the mix. A few days ago, I found a Spotify playlist that includes all of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s piano concertos in full. All 27 to be exact. And one by one, I listened to them. Every last one.

Everyone knows Mozart was a prodigy — even to non-classical music fans, it is common knowledge. He wrote his first piano concerto at age 11, though many anthologies list his first complete piano concerto with No. 5 in D major (K. 175). This is because he sampled so heavily from other composers in his first four piano concertos. In fact, many anthologies don’t even include the first four in the master list of his piano concertos — they’re in their own category. This is most likely because Mozart sampled so heavily from other composers for these primal works. In No. 1 in F major (K. 37), the first movement (Allegro) employs use of melodies based on an early sonata by German composer Hermann Raupach. 
It wouldn’t be entirely inappropriate to say that this first concerto is elementary. Though beautifully melodic and filled with pathos-infused phrases, it has 11-year-old written all over it. I mean, he didn’t even write the whole damn thing. But I don’t say this to slander his name, because what other 11-year-old still has his music headlining at concert halls all over the world over 200 years after his death? I can’t even put on a real pair of pants to go to class.
But his (and my) rudimentary works aren’t the point. In fact, it’s his own evolution that I find so interesting.  And what piques my interest regarding Mozart’s piano concertos is the growth. Mozart started so young, and figured out who he was as an artist along the way. As I listened to every single piano concerto over the span of four days, examining each one in succession, I noticed the themes and techniques commonly associated with Mozartian style. I’ll spare readers an in-depth analysis of every single piece, but his final one, No. 27 in B-flat major (K. 595), seems like a complete 180 from his early attempts. Written in 1791 (the year he died), Mozart employed characteristics that would soon be common in the following century. Each movement is longer and more detailed, and doesn’t follow the strict compositional patterns of the time. 
Of course, comparing his 11-year-old writings with those in his prime seems hardly fair. Additionally, it feels strange humanizing Mozart in such a way that compares to the everyday person. He was such a genius that relating his endeavors to, let’s say, my life, seems almost disrespectful. But the course of personal evolution can be made less daunting  when we know we’re not alone. Very little of how Mozart lived on a daily basis is known; whatever musicologists have learned about his life is through the letters he wrote to his family and colleagues. Even though he was, in my humble opinion, the greatest composer of all time, Mozart was human, which is something I tend to forget often. So comparing his creative struggles to mine shouldn’t be too outlandish.
Would Mozart cringe reading his early compositions, the same way I do when I read my own work from previous years? It’s hard to say. I’ll just tell myself “no.” Mozart thought everything he wrote was perfect. Therefore, I should feel the same about my own work.

I had the good fortune to attend the “Brave Spaces” panel discussion that was put on by the School of Social Work on Thursday. I have been paying close attention to free speech issues since I was a student at the School of Social Work. It is clear that this is a very serious topic on campuses, and I felt that the panel had a very measured discussion that made me feel proud to be a Trojan.
During the presidential campaign and after it has been everywhere apparent that there are lines being drawn in the cultural sand. At times it seems as though our ability to have debate and discuss the difficult issues that face us is like a lexical wall being erected faster than you can say “TRUMP,” or “TRIGGERED.”
I spent the final months of the election in India and the country I returned to was more like “Bizarro America” than the familiar world I inhabited (especially on social media!). I feel as though all my relations and USC have been going through spasms of rejection and acceptance.
One name that came up during the panel was Milo Yiannopoulos. At this time he has been recognized as persona non grata by virtually everyone with the exception of a small pocket of the alt-right. 
In Fall 2015, when Trump was more amusement than a serious political figure, Yiannopoulos spoke to the USC College Republicans in a room smaller than the one that held the Free Speech panel. 
At the time, Bahar Mustafa, an administrator at a British university, had caused a stir because she had prevented white male students from attending a campus event. I had the opportunity to ask Yiannopoulos for his opinion on the matter. 
His response: “While I don’t believe in anything Bahar Mustafa thinks, I support her right to say whatever she wants because that is what it means to live in a liberal democracy.”
Both his talk and the Brave Spaces discussion were pro-free speech. This is something that makes me feel positively toward USC in general. I went to the Brave Spaces discussion wanting an answer to where USC stands regarding this issue and I felt like the speakers by and large had good, pro-free speech answers. I think this is a very big topic that is important and it is in a state of evolution. I hope that USC stays strong and maintains an open dialogue. USC students and faculty continue to make our community one of intellectual diversity and positive debate.

USC remembered the importance of free speech after Chicago University got a massive grant for their free speech advocacy. I am teary-eyed.

Zoe Cheng | Daily Trojan
What happened in Sutherland Springs, Tex. last Sunday is, in one word, unbearable. For a mass shooting to come so soon after double tragedies in Las Vegas and New York is unbearable. To think that this happened in a town where everyone knows each other is unbearable.
The shooting suspect, Devin Patrick Kelley, is a terrorist. Anyone who enters a church and massacres those in worship is one. There is no room for debate. White killers are often designated the “lone wolf” murderer instead of a “terrorist,” recognized as a person whose entire life and upbringing and mental condition must be taken into consideration in order to make sense of his actions. But that is a two-faced claim, simply because these actions can never be allowed to make sense or become normalized into the human condition. 
On an utterly different note, it is confounding why white killers are spared the labels that befall minorities who commit similar acts — a mentality that mirrors the way the world likes to see white people versus everyone else.
And yet, this debate is only a superficial one — one that provides little room for effective solutions to ending mass violence. Actual change, which nowadays supersedes almost anything when debating access to guns, is something that can only be catalyzed through swift and urgent action in Congress.
The suspect in the New York attack, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov from Uzbekistan, is still alive — his actions deemed terrorism by President Donald Trump. Saipov uttered “Allahu Akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” at the scene, according to witnesses, and it was discovered that he was “providing material support to ISIS,” according to CNN. After the events that day, in which Saipov killed eight with a truck, there began a brief campaign on social media about the term “Allahu Akbar,” how it derives from a feeling of love and everyday usage instead of the fear many Americans may associate with terrorism — a campaign justifiably needed in order for the public not to conflate one man’s actions with an entire religion of people.
The tragedy in New York did not revolve around guns and has little to do with gun control, but everything to do with a culture of mass violence in America — one in which guns are an inherent part and contributor. One thing about the news cycle is that it wheels by quickly, rolls on without a second glance, tragedy after tragedy falling into memory in favor of covering the next one. 
Perhaps that in itself is one of the greatest contributors to the overwhelming sense of horror that can settle into numbness in the wake of mass violence — it becomes so that a person moves on just as fast as the news does. And that is, entirely too quickly.
The shooting that took place in Texas continues to disturb and devastate as more intimate layers of the tragedy are peeled back and revealed: The act happened in a small town, in a place of worship, the details landing in arguably the deepest place that heartbreak can occur. One understands this from reading the descriptions of those who died and who was injured: according to Joe Tackitt, Sheriff of Wilson County, “I think nearly everyone [at the church] had some type of injury.” The deceased include children, a pregnant woman, and some even from the same family. A New York Times article lists this devastating statistic: The massacre left about 7 percent of the people who lived in the rural Texas town dead.
As long as individuals with records of instability or violence like Kelley’s can access obvious weapons (most dangerously, guns) that can wreak mass destruction, it will never be enough to designate who is a terrorist and who isn’t. All culpable individuals commit equally unthinkable acts against American society. All threaten American lives and the lives of those who want to live at peace in this country. It is time for change.
I have never believed politicians and commentators who say it is “too soon” after tragedy to take action, because how is one to believe they are so wallowed in emotion that they are paralyzed, unable to activate real change in legislation? And yet, it is impossible to bend like this — tragedy after tragedy after unimaginable tragedy — without breaking. Sometimes it does feel like too much. But empathy and passivity can never be conflated into one.
 For all this administration’s talk about threats and protecting Americans from what’s outside, it is becoming excessively clear that a large source of danger is harbored inside American borders, inside laws that refuse to mold to a reality grown frantic and fearful of mass violence. 
Context can never be diminished here. The timeline of how soon the Sutherland Springs shooting occurred after Las Vegas and the New York vehicular attack is mind-numbing, and that is exactly the feeling this nation and its lawmakers must do everything to avoid. Numbness is a sensation to overcome by understanding that mass violence is not normal, not normal, not normal. It is nothing to succumb to and nothing thoughts and prayers can alleviate. It is one of the greatest shames in American politics that people are made to believe nothing can be done.

Zoe, I realize this is an opinion piece and you are certainly entitled to express your opinion, but this has to be one of the most convoluted and baffling articles I’ve read in a long time.   You go from race-baiting to defining terrorism to gun control to psychobabble in under 900 words.  This has to be a record for a DT writer.

This article makes USC look bad. An icon of the modern era? What?!
As a USC alumni, I can honestly say that I have never been as offended by an article written on the Daily Trojan as I am now. All these ideas are utter garbage. For the first time I now feel a sense of shame having graduated from USC.
I feel a sense of shame for having to share the Trojan title with you. What gives you the credibility to deem these ideas as utter garbage? What exactly do you do, Mr. Tommy Trojan? I actually feel sorry for you. You’re an alum disrespecting undergraduate students in the comments of a DT article simply for trying an idea out.
The second idea, “Tipsy Freeze,” makes us look bad. It perpetuates the image of SC being a “party, tailgate, greek” oriented school. I think it’s tasteless, no pun intended.
I agree with you, but look at it in two ways. #1, let them believe in their hackneyed, worthless ideas. I took, what was that entrepreneurship class here, that made you write a PPM to propose to a VC??? Anyways, I read the ideas of all the other students (because the professor had you post it on Blackboard), and none of them were impressive or novel. So who cares about someone trying to get a lead-filled balloon to fly? #2, why would you divulge your “next big thing?” Only a fool would do that. You think the founders of Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. were openly telling people their ideas? Hell no. 
So let the herd show us their hackneyed, stale ideas, and scoff. Let them stay stuck in stupid, while you think of a good idea to get ahead…..Btw, the two schools that produce the most successful alumni in terms of business startups/entrepreneurship are Harvard and Stanford. Their alumni, put out the next big things that change the world. With that said, I’d rather go to those schools if I could do it all over again, and given the chance to go there.

overhearduniversity
It’s filled to the brim with funny, relatable posts geared to our demographic. Overhearduniversity features exactly the kind of outlandish exchanges you wish you could have with your professor but would never actually dare to do. Other greats such as overheardnewyork, overheardla, and overheardlondon remind you that no matter where you are in the world, everyone speaks the same language of Flawed Human.
Happeningindtla
Happeningindtla updates their IG multiple times per day with special events happening in the DTLA area. They are a great resource for drink specials and getting the inside scoop on what’s opening up downtown.
dailyhumor_4u
This comedy account is constantly updated so you are always on top of the most relevant videos and memes. Dailyhumor_4u is private, which can be annoying when you want to share content with friends, but it’s also one of the pages I most frequently try to tag my friends in.
Thedogist
Like Humans of New York, but with dogs. Need I say more? 
dinela
dinela is a curated foodie account updated daily with trendy LA restaurants. Bonus: if you tag dinela in your photo and they deem it pretty enough, they will feature you on their page (hello, new followers).
Losangeles_eats
The definitive foodporn insta to follow, losangeles_eats features insane stop-your-heart insta-worthy bites from around the greater LA area. Previous features have included Square Bar Cafe, Birthday Cake (read up oncookie dough cones), and Bardonna.
Neighborsfromhell
Literally the most hilarious text exchanges between rational people and their insane neighbors. They’re not posted daily, but when they are, it is usually pure comedy gold.
Newyorkercartoons
Blame me for being a current events junkie, but sometimes I like a little politics infused with my comedy. Really though, it is like being a kid again and stealing the comics section of the newspaper. This time, it’s totally justifiable because they’re “adult” comics.
thelasocialites/instaworthyla
Some people might say you should only follow three LA-focused instas. Some people are 110% wrong. InstaworthyLA posts all the places that make the perfect backdrop for your next insta.Even better, they are generally ahead of the curve and some of their food set-ups are inspo for days.
NPS
I had to throw this account in because I love nature. It was tough deciding between this, Public Lands, Bureau of Land Management, and the many National Geographic accounts. Ultimately, the national parks service IG won out because it features public lands in the western and southwestern parts of the United States more regularly, which makes all the wanderlust it inspires a little more actionable and realistic.

Welcome to Sex and the Campus, a weekly column where I discuss all things love and relationships. It should be noted that I do not claim to be any kind of expert in either area. Dating is hard, but hopefully reading this column won’t be. 
If you have any burning questions about love and relationships, or just have a good dating horror story to share feel free to send them to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com 
This week we’re talking about getting comfortable. Is it really so bad, and when should it happen in a relationship?
In every relationship there comes a time when the honeymoon phase wears off and you become “comfortable.” This looks different for every couple, but it comes with the same negative connotation for all. Most people believe that when someone gets comfortable (normally the guy) it means they stop trying. Flowers and extensively planned date nights become a thing of the past, and you’re left with getting ignored for football games and guy’s night out. 
Okay, getting comfortable doesn’t always have to be that grim, but just like with all things in life: Moderation is key. The fact of the matter is, it’s a good thing to get comfortable with your partner; it’s healthy. It means you trust them can be vulnerable. It means you can actually be loved for you. It even means that you can pass the dreaded gas in front of them — maybe keep this one to a minimum. 
It doesn’t mean you stop trying, or that the romance suddenly dies off completely. It may take a little more forethought and effort on both partner’s ends, but it’s not impossible. Actually, this is when things become more fun. Instead of crafting the perfect texts or dates, not knowing if they’ll even like it, you know what will make them happy. You know their favorite foods, colors, and that they’d almost always rather stay in, watch a movie and order UberEats. 
Love isn’t just a feeling, it’s an action. Once those butterflies and daydreams start to subside, you have to become more of an active participant in your relationship. It takes work, determination and a willingness not to give up when things get hard. You’re going to be disappointed and hurt sometimes by your partner, but you’re also going to be the one disappointing and hurting other times. Being comfortable with someone means that when those times arise, your first instinct is to apologize and figure out how you can make things right. 
Compromise is key, and so is communication. When you’re comfortable with someone, you know all of their little tics. You know what certain body language means, and you understand how to read between the lines of what they’re saying. You know how to make your partner laugh, cry and everything else in between, and vice versa. 
Everyone gets comfortable at different speeds, and it looks different on everyone. For example, recently I have found out what my boyfriend looks like when he’s comfortable. He’s not any less amazing, or loving, or supportive, or caring— he’s just safe. He’s happy just spending time with me at home watching Hulu, sending me little affectionate texts every day and doing the dishes because he knows I hate them. 
See, none of this is bad. However, I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic. I like letters, flowers and date nights. I’m happy when I can explore places with someone and get out of the USC bubble. I like surprises. 
This is where communication is so important. Now, I could be extremely passive aggressive, not tell my boyfriend how I’m feeling and leave him to guess what it is I need. Or, I could just explain to him how I’ve been feeling and what it is I need out of the relationship to feel more fulfilled. I chose the latter option. And guess what? My boyfriend was really glad I talked to him and went on to make more of an effort on the little things. 
Comfort doesn’t have to be scary, and it definitely doesn’t have to be where romance goes to die. It’s just another phase of the ever ongoing relationship process. As you grow with a person, it’s easy to feel safe with them and get comfortable. Just remember to talk to them about how you’re feeling and what you need, and ask them to do the same. 
Remember this equation: Comfort + Communication + Action = Romance. 
Keep it comfy ‘SC.
