Career night · Redshirt junior guard Jordan Adams led the Women of Troy with a career-high 21 points and 12 rebounds in USC’s 81-46 win over Santa Clara on Monday night. The Trojans are 2-0. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
In their second game of the season, the Women of Troy beat Santa Clara by a score of  81-46 Monday night at the Galen Center.
The team never fell behind the Gaels, and at one point boasted a 45-point lead over a team that could not stop the Trojans’ offensive onslaught.
Redshirt junior guard Jordan Adams led the team in both scoring and rebounds, hitting eight of her 13 shots to score 21 points. Adams also hit three three-pointers in a game that she dominated in scoring and rebounding.
Adams secured 12 rebounds on her way to the double-double. The game was Adams’s second straight double-double of the season. She also tied her career high in points.
Three other Trojans notched double digits in scoring during Monday night’s matchup. Harvard graduate transfer Temi Fagbenle recorded her first double-digit scoring as a Trojan with 17 points.
Freshman Aliyah Mazyck put another 14 points in the book for USC, and sophomore Kristen Simon added 11 points to go along with seven rebounds.
The Trojans’ offense was unstoppable in part because of how many players were able to find the basket for USC. Both Adams and Mazyck were in double digits before the first half was over.
The flow of the game was severely affected by the number of foul calls in a game in which each team was called for 27 fouls. The Trojans scored more points from the freethrow line than the field in the first quarter, and the team’s final nine points of the half also came from the stripe.
By halftime, the Women of Troy were leading 48-17 behind 7-0 and 11-0 runs in the first and second quarters respectively.
The offensive firepower did not stop for the Women of Troy after halftime, however, and the team opened with a 15-0 run. USC maintained their lead with the third period closing on a 67-31 score in favor of the Trojans.
USC was outscored in the fourth quarter giving up 15 points while only scoring 14.
The team will have nearly a week to rest and prepare for their next matchups as part of the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame Challenge in Spokane, Washington. To open the holiday season, the team will have a Sunday afternoon game against Grand Canyon, a Monday night game against West Virginia, and a Tuesday night game against Gonzaga.

He’s back · After a season-ending shoulder injury sidelined him last season, sophomore Jordan McLaughlin led the Trojans with 22 points. – Brian Ji| Daily Trojan
The USC men’s basketball team fended off a gritty effort from Monmouth for a 101-90 victory on Monday night at Galen Center.
With under four minutes to play, the Trojans gained separation in a close game down the stretch. Up 84-82, Katin Reinhardt and Elijah Stewart connected on back-to-back threes to push the lead to eight, and USC was able to hold on for the win.
They survived against a tough Monmouth team that shocked UCLA with an overtime win over the Bruins on Friday night, and came close to doing the same at USC.
But the Trojans were too much in the end, as five players finished in double figures. Jordan McLaughlin led the way with 22 points, and Nikola Jovanovic and Stewart both had 20.
“I thought that was a very exciting college basketball game tonight,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “A lot of action, a lot of tough shots made by both teams, and a lot of great plays. I’m proud of how our players played down the stretch, offensively and defensively.”
USC took a one-point lead into the half, and the teams went back and forth in the second half with the intensity ratcheted up a notch. There were seven lead changes alone in the first 10 minutes of the half, with Monmouth’s three-point shooting keeping the score close.
McLaughlin’s floater put the Trojans ahead by four with 7:38 to play. But the Hawks hung tough, with Justin Robinson making a couple of tough threes that drew Monmouth within one at 77-76.
Robinson finished with a game-high of 28 points.
“We just wanted to play our defensive roles,” McLaughlin said on containing Monmouth’s offense. “In the second half, [Robinson] got hot. We decided to trap him on ball screens and everybody just rotated over from there.”
The Trojans scored the first seven points of the game, capped off by a three-pointer by McLaughlin. A fastbreak layup by Reinhardt gave the Trojans a 17-6 lead, one they extended to as much as 16 midway through the half after Jovanovic completed a three-point play.
But Monmouth came storming back, and it was all Hawks from the midway point on. They went on an 18-6 run to take the lead, with Robinson and Deon Jones leading the charge.
Back-to-back tough jump shots by Robinson and a three by Jones cut the lead to two, and a spectacular reverse layup by Jones gave Monmouth its first lead of the night at 44-42 late in the half.
“We knew Monmouth was a good basketball team,” Enfield said. “They play at such a fast pace. In the first half when they made their run, because of our foul trouble, we got a little winded trying to keep up with them and let them back in the game. They earned it because they made some great plays and really ran the floor and got back in the game.”
Reinhardt’s basket gave the Trojans a 47-46 lead heading into halftime. Jovanovic’s 14 points led USC in the first half. Playing a highly efficient game, he finished shooting seven-of-eight from the field, a highly efficient game.
“I was just trying to do my work,” he said. “And they weren’t able to stop me.”
Up next for the Trojans will be a game against New Mexico at the Galen Center on Saturday.

We’ve known since the blowout win over Utah that USC was one Ute loss away from controlling its own destiny in the hunt for the Pac-12 South title. After handing Utah its first loss of the season, we’ve patiently waited for another Pac-12 team to beat the Utes, and finally, one day after the Trojans extended their win streak to four games, the Arizona Wildcats upset the Utes 37-30.
I had faith that someone would come along and spoil Utah’s one loss season, but I assumed it would happen this Saturday when they face the Bruins. To make last weekend even better, UCLA lost to Washington State.
That’s not to say that the Trojans have an easy road ahead. They still have to win their final two games of the season against Oregon and UCLA. Oregon is certainly far from where they were last season, but have improved tremendously this season and just upset Stanford, the team likely to win the Pac-12 North.
Utah’s loss opened the door for both UCLA and USC. Whichever of the three teams wins out is the team that will win the South. While USC battles Oregon in Eugene this weekend, UCLA and Utah will duke it out in Salt Lake City.
Stanford is one win away from clinching the Pac-12 North, so whichever team comes out of the South will have to face a very good Stanford team. Last time USC met Stanford, they were handed their first loss of the season and the trajectory of their season changed.
Since interim head coach Clay Helton took over, however, the Trojans seem like a far cry from the team that lost to Washington. He’s slowed down the offense and relied more on the run game, and so far, his strategy is undefeated.
Though USC is riding a   four-game win streak, they have looked fragile in a handful of these wins. With the exception of the blowout over Utah, the Trojans haven’t won by more than eight points. They only beat Cal by six and barely beat Colorado by a field goal.
The Trojans cannot afford to play the way they have in their last three games if they want to beat Oregon and especially UCLA. Oregon has a four-game win streak of its own, including wins over Cal, Arizona State and Stanford. Oregon is a reenergized team that is more reminiscent of the Marcus Mariota era than the way they looked at the beginning of the season.
And if USC is able to leave Eugene with a win, they’ll still have UCLA waiting for them when they get back to Los Angeles. UCLA is in the same boat, just two wins away from the Pac-12 championship game. Josh Rosen is the best freshman in college football and has the skills and supporting talent to beat the Trojans for a fourth straight year. Cody Kessler will need to play like a redshirt senior to beat the Bruins. He, however, has been less of a presence this season than last and will need to channel last season’s success to beat Oregon and UCLA.
The good news for the Trojans is that the defense, which caused a lot of problems last season, has looked very good this season. The offense has stalled recently, and Kessler needs to fire up the offense and win out. The Men of Troy have overcome so much adversity already and pulling off wins against conference rivals would be the perfect ending to the season and Kessler’s career.

With The Force Awakens coming to theaters Dec. 18, it’s a great time to revisit what makes Star Wars so timeless: its epic musical score. 
In cinema, musical score is one of the most important aspects of sound design. Without sound, the viewer would not experience the film in quite the same way. Music brings the characters to life and helps us become part of the movie. It helps bridge the visual and auditory gaps.
The Star Wars series is equally defined by the plot, characters and setting and the musical score. Anyone who hears the “Main Theme” or “The Imperial March” will immediately hearken back to their past Star Wars experiences.  Those who have never seen a film from the franchise will still recognize these tunes that have come to dominate popular culture and have made a resurgence with the release of The Force Awakens.
The score of the original trilogy are made iconic by John Williams directing and use of trumpets for the melody of his music. He has also scored many other extremely well-known movies — from Jaws to E.T. to Indiana Jones to Schindler’s List.
Yet Star Wars seems unique to all others because of its recognizable tune and arrangement. Two of Williams’ songs in the Star Wars original trilogy, “The Imperial March” and “Main Theme.” Williams uses the trumpet as the highlighting instrument, helping make each song recognizable.  
In the “Main Theme” especially, Williams, uses secondary instruments such as bells and other like sound effects to give it a science-fiction theme. It helps set the movie and creates an out-of-this-world atmosphere. Additionally, these secondary instruments help transition between different segments of each song.
Williams also plays with the volume in his score to help signify certain scenes and characters. The score starts loud and ends soft, and undergoes many volume changes in between. It is almost like you can hear the struggle between light and dark without seeing it. 
This is especially apparent in “The Imperial March” — even without seeing Darth Vader walking down the corridor in the Death Star you can hear him coming.  In the “Main Theme” you don’t need to see Luke Skywalker standing behind the two suns of Tatooine — you only need to listen.  
Being able to visualize images from a film simply by hearing the chords of a score associated with it will always be a good indicator of a director’s success. And in that aspect, Star Wars is none less than pitch-perfect. 
The following are iconic songs from each of the six existing Star Wars Films:

My Friday night began on a positive note, with an advanced screening of Carol. I wasn’t the only one looking forward to it: the theater reached capacity and two women started verbally fighting over seats. The night might not have been so great for the inflamed patrons who expected that their online reservation would guarantee a spot in the notoriously tiny Ray Stark Theater but was favorable for the filmmakers, whose painstaking attention to detail, evident from the very beginning of the film, should be justly rewarded with eager audience members and packed seats.
Carol opens on a patterned sewer grate and tracks upward through the quiet, rain-slicked street that firmly plants us in 1950s New York City. From there, we find shelter inside the posh hotel lobby that introduces us to a luxurious world where a fedora-clad man declares, “Not much happening tonight.” This is just the fashion we will come to expect from most of the men throughout the film.
Indeed, “not much happening tonight” acts as an ironic juxtaposition, for just a few seats over sits Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) and Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) who are interrupted when both the camera and an obliviously loud male patron intrude on what is a clear moment of high tension. The movement from raw city streets to the plush, sophisticated interior also acts as a metaphor for the journey Therese is about to embark on, as a girl who begins as scrappy and unpolished and evolves into a refined, assured woman. Carol is the story of young shop girl Belivet’s affair with Aird, a wealthy suburban housewife who’s embroiled in a painful divorce from her husband Harge Aird (Kyle Chandler). Things become tricky when the women’s relationship begins to interfere with Carol’s custody over her daughter — Harge cites a “morality clause” during the divorce negotiations and claims that he loves his wife so deeply he’d rather fragment the family even more than free Carol and let her live as her true self.
None of this information should be read as a spoiler; any trailer of the film will tell you as much. And it’s knowing where a lot of the brilliant moments and tension are that pontificate the greatness in the film. When Harge Aird barges into the Aird home and finds Belivet in the living room there’s a moment of great intensity, followed by a knowing, accusatory look between husband and wife that inspires a round of laughter from the audience. For even though Aird and Belivet haven’t explicitly engaged in any romantic activity yet, the drama and levity is derived from knowing and anticipating what’s to come.
But the film shouldn’t be considered a comedy by any means — the lighter moments are few and far between the dramatic, arresting scenes filled with great cinematic depth and emotion. As viewers, we explore Belivet’s newfound identity only through distance. Most shots in the film are positioned to look through things: through bridge arches and hallways, window panes and curtains, scattered trees, mirrors and even through people, creating an alienation between the viewer and protagonists that borderlines forced voyeurism.
In fact, much of the film could be taken as a statement on the inherently visual aspect of filmmaking and audience participation. The act of looking is emphasized from beginning to end, but precisely what this emphasis suggests is unclear. The notorious male gaze is one that is attributed to cinema threefold — the male gaze on the woman, the gaze imposed by the camera and the gaze attributed to the audience gazing at the woman through the camera. But with Carol, we have Todd Haynes — an openly gay filmmaker — telling a story about women where men are the nuisances, dismissed and disgusting. This situation does call for further analyzation.
Maybe the calculated shots were for a purpose, and maybe they were simply because they are aesthetically gorgeous to view — the brilliance of Carol lies in the fact that it doesn’t overtly try to tell you anything. The story itself is a slow burn; its deliberate and meticulous unfurling of the plot lets the viewer soak in every moment, every slight brush of gloved hands and piercing glance between protagonists. The characters dance around the explicit, and even though that type of vagueness would lend itself to an audience’s propensity for frustration, there isn’t a single scene misplaced or ill-advised. Past events, such as Carol’s first affair with another woman, are alluded to, but never outrightly described. It’s in this conscious storytelling that Carol shines as a film, among action blockbusters and animated sequels, and it becomes clear that you won’t come across a similar one very soon.
Carol was a selection at the Cannes, AFI and Rome Film festivals this past year, and it’s clear why. Not only is the direction beautifully executed, but the production design is spot on, the costumes delightfully period appropriate and the dialogue precise yet not obvious. The acting is also pitch perfect — save for one misstep in the casting of Portlandia’s Carrie Brownstein, who emerges at the end as more of an overt token character than a nuanced choice. The beauty in Carol up until that point had been in the fact that stereotypes or broad generalizations of gay communities or individuals were next to nil. Furthermore, right up until Belivet and Aird kiss, it’s unclear what either’s intentions are for each other or themselves. Carol’s best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) is also gay, but isn’t played in any garish way that would suggest her preference.
The subtlety with which these characters are portrayed is where the film truly transcends. This rare exploration of a marginalized group is especially fascinating considering it takes place during a time where the suburban nuclear family seems to be the only way of life. This is the same landscape that holds films such as Sam Mendes’s Revolutionary Road and AMC’s series Mad Men as the definitive examples of life in the times. But with Haynes’s Carol, we have a new film to reference, a masterful work within the cinematic lexicon, not to be missed.

Downtown Los Angeles is known to be home to fresh and hip coffee places — G&B, short for Glanville & Babinski, is one of them. After moving locations from Sqirl, an organic and minimalist restaurant, G&B now considers Grand Central Market its permanent home.
Nestled in the back of the bustling market, G&B Coffee is one of the hottest spots in the whole complex. G&B is known to have one of the “best iced coffees in America.” The coffee shop plays host to a long line of loyal customers and curious coffee connoisseurs at almost every hour of the day. In an era where mainstream coffee chains dominate, quality coffee is hard to find. Despite its exceptional coffee, however, G&B’s price makes it difficult for college students to afford regularly.
The obscure coffee bar features lattes, cappuccinos, pastries and waffles for customers and places to sit while baristas make the drinks. G&B has a unique ordering system, where patrons can order anywhere on the paying screen, instead of an area with a designated cash register, making it easier to order instead of waiting in line. The service is friendly, with baristas greeting customers with warm smiles and taking their orders right away.
The iced almond macadamia milk latte, G&B’s most popular drink, is a creamy and subtle espresso drink that is homemade every single morning. Don’t be fooled by the “latte” in the description — the G&B macadamia milk latte is actually just almond milk made only with water, almonds, macadamias and dates. Coffee and milk lovers will love its light and delicate taste of almond and macadamia served in a cute mason jar.
However, though the coffee is enchanting and delicious, some customers just don’t think the price is worth it. David Lewis, a regular at G&B Coffee and Grand Central Market, said he thinks the quality is great but the price is questionable.
“I work a block away, so I come to G&B once a week as an end of the week treat. I would like to come here more often, but $6 per coffee is just way too much for me,” Lewis said. “They make the almond milk themselves which is pretty cool. I also like the brown butter blondie pastry. Other than that, I think I could probably make similar coffee at home.”
Another highly popular drink, the mocha, available in both hot and iced, is the perfect combination of strong, sweet and light. However, the beverage is a whopping $7.
“It’s my first time in downtown Los Angeles and Grand Central Market, since I lived in Korea most of my life,” commented  a sophomore majoring in public relations Grace Song, “I like how G&B coffee is burrowed in such a cozy and clean environment. It definitely makes me want to explore more of the city.”
Though the atmosphere serves as a sleek and aesthetically pleasing reprieve to the hustling and overcrowded Grand Central Market, G&B Coffee is pretty lively itself. Whether its workers looking to treat themselves to a nice cup of coffee after a long week or college students scoping out the newest coffee place, it’s a fine and quaint place that’ll leave customers wanting to return. Unfortunately, because of its outrageously high prices, probably not often.
The great irony is that college students will be the first in line to complain that coffee farmers aren’t being paid enough or that café employees should all have health care. But they’re also the first to complain when they are expected to help pay for all of that.

Soprano Angela Meade has established a reputation as one of the most respected opera singers of her generation. Hailed as “astounding” and “a force of nature,” the American soprano has come a long way since her days as a master’s student at the Thornton School of Music.
Meade is collected and reserved; one would never guess from her down-to-earth personality that she has graced the stages of some of the world’s most prominent opera houses. Meade spoke about her road to success, starting out as a pre-med student in college and eventually becoming “the most talked about soprano of her generation,” according to Opera News.
Meade’s operatic studies began after high school in her hometown of Centralia, Washington. She enrolled in a local community college intending to become a doctor. It was also here that she began singing.
“I moonlighted in the college choir,” Meade said. “I found it to be a great outlet from all of those science and lab courses.”
At this point, Meade hadn’t had any formal vocal training; it was her college choir director who introduced her to her first voice teacher. In due time, her superiors realized that she possessed an extraordinary talent for this art and encouraged her to pursue opera professionally.
She went on to graduate from Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, and soon after began her Master’s of music in vocal arts at USC, where she studied under tenor Gary Glaze. Meade notes that her time at USC was occupied with hard work and devotion to her craft.
“I had a really great time at USC,” Meade said. “I was very focused — I was involved in the opera every semester I was there and was involved in recital repertoire as well.”
She graduated with her master’s degree in 2004 and briefly began her Doctorate in musical arts at USC before gaining acceptance to the prestigious Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, a post-graduate opera program that has produced some of opera’s most successful singers.
While still in her studies at AVA, Meade won the 2007 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, arguably the most prestigious vocal competition in the country. It was just one of many competitions she would eventually dominate, winning a total of 57 of them throughout the span of her early career. The day after the she won the Met competition, the Met offered her contract to cover the lead role of Elvira in Giuseppe Verdi’s Ernani that would be staged the following season. A year later, she would make her Met debut as a last minute replacement.
“I was getting out of a taxi when I got a call,” Meade said. “I was just in New York for a costume fitting and had just returned to Philadelphia when the Met asked me to step in.”
With only a day’s notice and few rehearsals under her belt, she accepted and soon returned to New York.
Usually, singers must already have an established career before singing, let alone debuting, a major role at the Met. But Meade isn’t like most singers; she possesses a voice that is larger than life yet is still agile enough to produce rapid-fire coloratura. It’s a voice that is seamless from her stratospheric high notes to her thunderous lower register. Her successful debut sealed her fate as opera’s newest “it girl” and has been a regular at the Met ever since.
Future engagements for Meade include Verdi’s Requiem in both Brazil and Spain this spring, as well as her debut with Teatro Real in Madrid in its production of Norma next season. When not performing, Meade describes herself a homebody, preferring to stay home or traveling with her new husband, tenor and opera singer John Matthew Myers.
“[Myers] and I are both very down to earth,” Meade said. “It’s nice that he totally understands what I do. He understands the travel, and we’re able to spend a lot of time traveling together. It’s the key to keeping [our marriage] normal and alive.”
At the peak of her career, Meade shows no signs of slowing down. This season, she returns to LA Opera in the title role of Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma, a role she has performed several times. Norma is described as one of the most vocally and emotionally taxing roles in operatic repertoire; fittingly, this is Meade’s bread and butter.
“It’s a role that I feel very close to,” said Meade. “As I get older and wiser, I realize new things about the character. I don’t think of her so much as the leader of the Druids — I think of her as a woman.”
LA Opera’s production of Norma runs from Nov. 21 to Dec. 13. Student tickets can be found online.

It’s been a little more than a month since the Faculty Senate passed the resolution calling for the deferment of greek recruitment to spring semester. Since then, several members of the greek system have voiced concern over the proposal, denouncing it as an blatant attack on greek life.
It’s easy to understand why greek leaders are scared of the resolution — they view it as a threat to the presence of greek life on campus. But their fear also lies in a greater misunderstanding of the proposal as an effort to curb greek life rather than a thoughtful change that could help make the recruitment process more welcoming for all involved.
The Senate’s proposal, which essentially would require all students taking part in recruitment to wait until they have obtained a USC GPA, was met with opposition by greek leaders, who took issue with both the content of the proposal as well as the way it was reached, citing a lack of student opinion in the decision-making process. Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath echoed concerns in a Nov. 9 post on Facebook, arguing, “We, as students, need to have a voice on every issue that pertains to our college experience.”
While the inclusion of student voices in decisions such as this one is undoubtedly important, so too is the assurance that students’ first experiences at the University are a positive one — an issue that this proposal seeks to address.
The transition to college is by no means an easy one. New students need to be given time to find their footing before being thrust into all the opportunities USC has to offer, and deferring greek recruitment is one way of doing that. Finding one’s niche is a difficult task while simultaneously juggling the stresses of academics and extracurricular involvement. Giving students the chance to focus on school their first semester before taking part in the hectic nature of rush and pledging will only result in a more secure, well-established group of prospective new members for the greek system when recruitment begins in the spring.
What is perhaps more profound about the deferment of greek recruitment — which begins even before the start of classes — is that it understands and seeks to productively address the stressful environment that recruitment creates. For students that join greek life, the concentration of multiple mandatory events immediately at the beginning of the semester can prove extremely stressful when juggling academic and extracurricular commitments.
And for the hundreds of freshmen turned down by the greek institutions of their choice, rejection can be a painful blow to receive so early in their undergraduate experience — devastation that can shape their outlook on the rest of the semester. The mental health ramifications of the social hierarchy of the greek system, then, can have grave consequences for new recruits. Shifting this recruitment to the spring semester can cushion the blow as students would have a support system to guide them through the recruitment process.
Furthermore, giving students the opportunity to assimilate to college life and get involved in other activities could also benefit the greek system by giving them an additional semester to attract more well-rounded recruits. Too often, new students are faced with handling the demands of recruitment often at the expense of getting involved in other things. And spring recruitment would allow students to engage with the people of the greek system before the recruitment process, giving them an objective view of greek life instead of relying on archaic stereotypes of different houses.
Just as USG started a campus-wide conversation about mental health with months of programming, the Academic Senate is doing the same thing — starting a conversation that has already taken place on deferred recruitment campuses such as Baylor University, the University of San Diego, Villanova University and more. It perhaps takes a more mature perspective to understand how greek life affects mental health, but deferred recruitment could create real, tangible improvements for creating a more welcoming freshman experience.
Daily Trojan Fall 2015 Editorial Board
After reading your article, I’ve concluded that your understanding of the Greek community’s opposition is off base.  The opposition to the resolution does not stem from the notion that the resolution is a threat to the presence of Greek life on campus.  The opposition largely stems from the financial impact that Chapters would face by enacting the resolution.  Even beyond that misunderstanding, I find contention with a majority of the claims in your article.  Based on my background, I feel I can adequately comment on deferred recruitment.
I’m a senior in a Fraternity, and transferred to USC my sophomore year.  I am an active member in the Greek community, and continue to remain involved in both academic and extracurricular activities on campus.  I transferred from a university with deferred recruitment, and therefore, had to wait until Spring to rush, after having the opportunity to explore other organizations during the Fall semester.  With that in mind, I firmly oppose deferred recruitment and, looking back, wish I had been given the opportunity to decide when I could rush.  I think your response to the resolution trivializes the argument from the Greek community.
First, denying freshmen and incoming transfers the opportunity to rush their first semester at USC would be similar to denying USC the ability to accept an incoming Freshman class.  Chapters rely on new members to replace the graduating seniors, and many Chapters would find themselves struggling to cover overhead and National dues without accepting Freshmen into their organizations.  
Second, you argue that trying to manage mandatory events at the beginning of the semester among academic and extracurricular commitments can make Freshmen stressed.  What about on campus organizations like the Trojan Knights, Helenes, Marshall groups, band, or even sports?  In the Fall semester, the football team and band travel to locations throughout the United States.  How do you think the added stress of missing classes and approaching deadlines makes those students feel?  Greek life is targeted because it’s the largest collective organization on campus, but it is no different than a number of other organizations that share the campus.  
Third, deferred recruitment will not make the rushing process feel more welcoming nor increase Freshmen on-campus involvement.  The general benefit of rushing at the beginning of the academic year is that a majority of the incoming students are unaware of the perceived standings of Greek chapters.  This affects fraternities more than sororities because of the different rushing processes.  Males get to choose which fraternities they rush, as opposed to females, who must visit each sorority chapter.  Having a general ignorance of the fraternity ranks encourages Freshmen to visit more Chapters than they would if they had a full semester to understand where each fraternity is perceived.  By visiting more houses, Freshmen have more opportunities to enter a Chapter.  As for involvement, do you think that once students join the Greek system they simply stop participating in other on-campus activities?  Greek students are some of the most involved students on USC’s campus, and many Chapters even require participation in another on-campus organization.  
Finally, what happened to working together?  This resolution was passed almost a month before the Faculty Senate decided to share the results with the Greek community, and caused a stir because the Administration started talks to change recruitment for Fall 2016.  Moving recruitment doesn’t erase problems, it just creates new ones.  USC will see more progress by working with its students.  Hopefully we will find a way to appease Faculty and the Greek community, while also letting students enjoy their first semester of independence.
To be fair, why is the deferment just focused on the Greek system?  Isn’t finding your way as a Freshman or new transfer student part of the experience regardless of the path one chooses?  Sure it’s stressful.  Some doors will close.  And others will open.  Should our athletic teams, newspaper, clubs and marching band not recruit new students in the Fall too?  Are the mental health issues somehow confined to just those seeking a Greek experience?

This past Friday, as the world witnessed the tragedy in Paris unfold, I couldn’t stop thinking about study abroad.
Those of us living half a world away heard news reports of shootings and explosions occurring in Paris, taking people’s lives in football stadiums and concert halls. The attacks, which ISIS claimed responsibility for, killed at least 129 people and put the city in an unprecedented state of emergency.
When I went to Facebook to read more information, I stumbled upon at least a dozen of my high school and college friends’ statuses updating people about their safety. They were studying in Paris for a semester, and thanks to Facebook re-activating its Safety Check feature, I learned that they were all safe. It was a relief, I know. However, not every study abroad student was safe. A Cal State Long Beach student studying at Strate College of Design in France was killed in the attacks, several Los Angeles news outlets have reported.
Without a doubt, these attacks shine a light on terrorism and political unrest in Europe. But, for those slated to go abroad next semester, these attacks make students grapple with the uncertainty that comes with living with the unfamiliar. These attacks serve as a reminder of the wide spectrum of lessons study abroad teaches students in a way that American classrooms just cannot.
Alex Janin studied abroad in Paris during Spring 2015. When she first heard of the Nov. 13 attacks, she immediately contacted her host family. At first they didn’t respond to her email.
“I just felt nauseous. It was right when everything was starting to unfold,” she said. “I felt sick because I knew the situation might just keep getting worse.”
After sending a Snapchat message to her host sister, who reassured Janin that the family was safe, she said she felt relieved but was glued to the developing coverage. Her awareness of French politics was heightened by her time living in the country.
At USC, the Office of Overseas Studies helps raise the cultural awareness for hundreds of students each year. The office facilitates 55 programs in 30 countries. Janin studied in Paris through the office.
When it comes to study abroad, safety should always be on students’ minds. Anywhere outside of the United States the meaning of being an American will take on new contexts. In January, before I boarded a plane for my study abroad semester in London and 12 days after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, I remember my parents having a talk with me about being “safe.”
It wasn’t in the normal tone parents have with kids before dropping them off in college for their freshman year. Instead, it was a talk about how the world outside the confines of the U.S. was a completely different place. The politics are different. Young Americans should understand this, and the best way to do that is through organized travel.
Study abroad also heightens empathy for places far off. The tragedy in Paris is a human tragedy — but for Janin, who lived there, it took on a whole new meaning.
“I could clearly see myself dining at 10 p.m. in any cafe, and my heart hurt for everyone whose normal lives were shattered into chaos,” Janin said. “I would say my perception of the city has changed somewhat.”
Yet, other lessons can abound for those who take the leap of faith to study abroad. For Janin, even six months removed from living in Paris, the experience continues to teach her lessons. In the middle of the chaos, Parisians adopted the policy of opening their homes to fellow Parisians who couldn’t make it to their own houses or those who didn’t want to try.
“While I was abroad, I noticed Parisians often keep to themselves, keep tight knit circles and stay out of people’s business,” she said. “It was wonderful to see the sense of community last night after such a horrific event.”
Study abroad, despite its uncertainty, is worth it. Regardless of the unpredictability, no student should want to trade it.

From break ups to make ups and everything in between, “Love U” captures the nuances of college students’ relationships. “Love U” runs in DeeTs on Mondays.  Do you have a love story to share? Send Love U submissions to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com
I was a freshman.  Never before had I been in a place where there were so many options, so many gorgeous options. And never before had so many guys actually been interested in me. So I was giving my number out to anyone who asked — and capitalizing on any opportunity for free food. And while I chose to see this as “giving everyone a shot” because “you never know what a person is like until you get to know them,” it’s more likely that I had a problem that actually stemmed from my insecurities and inability to say no.
One night I was at a party playing rage cage when I saw someone walk past me in my periphery. I did a double take. This guy was very attractive, he had style and I was instantly drawn to him. Later that night, a few of us were on the balcony. We all introduced ourselves and talked for a while, which allowed me to get to know the boy, whose name I learned was Max*, in a casual group setting.
When I got home later that night I checked Facebook to find that Max had sent me a friend request. I couldn’t help but feel a little giddy that he had at least enough interest in me to hit the request button. I gladly accepted and proceeded to stalk.
I kept seeing him around campus and at parties in the weeks to follow. I would always kind of look at him to see what he doing and hope that maybe we would make eye contact. A couple weeks after our first meeting, I was dancing with a group of my friends at a frat party, and he walked up to me and asked to dance. I said yes. We danced and talked until the party ended, after which he got my number and texted me immediately. We texted until we both went to bed.
They say you shouldn’t meet someone you want anything serious with at a frat party. Oops.
The problem was, a month prior I had met an older guy named Jason* at an orientation-like function. So then I was going on dates with two different guys. I couldn’t help myself. I felt guilty because I had never dated two guys at once, but I was really into both of them and my friends said it was okay. For a few weeks, I found myself lying to them about where I was when I was with the other one. They also lived in the same apartment complex, which made things all the more complicated.
I knew I had to make a decision eventually. My feelings toward either one of them could no longer grow and develop if I continued to hold onto the other. After making a hefty pro versus con list, I chose Max. He was charming and well mannered. He had called me Ubers home on multiple occasions and thanked me for letting him take me out after every date. He was ambitious and had the same interest in music as me. He was also one of the tidiest people I’d met, which I needed in my life.
Since then, I’ve questioned whether or not I made the right decision. It’s been a year since our first date, and he still hasn’t committed in either a public sense or an emotional one. We went on dates and shared intimate moments, but now I’m starting to question whether or not I’m being taken advantage of.
To me, commitment in a public sense means Facebook official. Not just for the status, but so girls can stop messaging him thinking he’s single. Commitment means posting pictures of me on his social media, so people know I exist. Finally, commitment means I don’t have to keep asking how important I am to him. While I am bae, babe, baby and boo, I am not a girlfriend. I get all the heart and kiss emojis you could imagine, but I can’t get an “I love you.”
I want an emotional connection. I want to be invested in someone and to have him invest in me. I want to feel wanted and to be put on display without feeling like I’m being judged. He claims he sees himself with me for the rest of his life but cannot post a picture me, whereas all the other important people in his life have been highlighted. 
When I confront him about commitment, he claims he’s too scared. That he’s had bad luck with girls in the past. “Too scared” should not be an excuse. But isn’t that my excuse? Isn’t that why I’ve been going along with this for a year now? Why I’m still here when all my friends have told me to end things multiple times? When I have told myself I can’t do it anymore? I’m too scared to lose the little spark of a relationship I do have. I know he likes me a lot, and I’m scared to lose that. I’m scared I will ruin his already tarnished outlook on love. I’m just not sure how long is long enough. I’ve been bombarded by thoughts and opinions of what love means in college, but there comes a point when I have to draw the line and say, hey, this is what I want and need.
I’ve managed to stick around by reminding myself that relationships in college aren’t serious, that they don’t need labels. But after a year I’ve started to yearn for a deeper, stronger connection that doesn’t make me question whether or not I’m making the right decision. Maybe someday soon I’ll wake up from this delusion of college romance and decide I really do need something more. But for now, I’m hopelessly in love.

Alright guys, this is getting a little bit out of hand. We have been down at the end of the first quarter in all of the last five games. To say that we are coming out of the gates slow is an understatement. But something has to be said about the resiliency the Trojans are showing under Coach Clay Helton. This heart and passion is reminiscient of Pete Carrol’s tenure where we felt like we could win any game no matter what. I’ll be honest though, that performance by USC on a cold night in Boulder, Colorado was hard to watch. There were some very key defensive and special teams plays that kept us in the game. It seems like that is the case every week. With Oregon and UCLA on the horizon, the Trojans are going to have to figure out a way to start and finish strong. One-dimensional gameplans will not work against the good teams, and we saw how great Oregon looked against Stanford on Saturday.
Grades:
Quarterback: D+
Running Backs: C+
Wide Receivers: B-
Offensive Line: C
Defensive Line: A-
Linebackers: B
Secondary: C
Special Teams: D
Overall: C
Prediction: Oregon 45- USC 41
Fight On!

Dear Tiffany,
My high school boyfriend and I both chose to attend USC, but we broke up right before the beginning of freshman year. Four years later, I have an amazing boyfriend, and see my ex fairly often. Recently, my interactions with my ex have become a little weird. I saw him making out with a girl the other night and I felt … I don’t know exactly how I felt, but it definitely made me uncomfortable. I love my boyfriend, but I don’t know how to explain what’s going on with my ex. Is it wrong to feel this way?

— 21 and Confused
This weird feeling toward your ex doesn’t necessarily mean you still pine for him. Though you have a different boyfriend now, your ex is still someone with whom you shared some good times during a recent part of your life. Seeing him macking on some stranger is a very jarring affirmation that he has moved on. It is normal to have a confusing emotional response to your surprise encounter, and I am confident you’ll think about it less and less with time. Your high school relationship ended for a reason and now you have someone else to love!
