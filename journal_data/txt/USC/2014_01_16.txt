The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Tuesday, Jan. 14 and Thursday, Jan. 16.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 8:05 a.m. on Jan. 14, a faculty member reported what she believed to be a suicide note written by a student in Parking Structure C. The student was contacted and claimed that the letter was written for his family in case something happened to him on his missionary trip. This was confirmed by a member of his missionary group.
At 9:35 a.m. on Jan. 14, four students were caught smoking marijuana in their dorm rooms in David X. Marks Tower and were cited to Judicial Affairs.
At 11:23 p.m. on Jan. 15, DPS officers responded to a student at Phi Kappa Psi who was intoxicated and deemed unfit to care for himself. A Los Angeles Fire Department RA unit was contacted, and RA Unit #15 responded and took the student to Good Samaritan Hospital to be treated.
Corrections
“Keck Discovers Cancer-Causing Agent” (Jan. 16) implies a new virus was found, which is false. The title should read “Keck Discovers Critical Factor of Viral Cancer.”
“University Praised for Latino Graduation Rates” (Jan. 16) referred to Gene Bickers as a “she” when the pronoun should be “he.”
“Progam Board hosts spring Variety Hour show” (Jan. 16) said the event took place on Tuesday when it took place on Wednesday.
“Progam Board hosts spring Variety Hour show” (Jan. 16) also quoted Daniel Clark when in fact his name is Andrew Clark.
The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Southern California Assemblyman Mike Gatto recently proposed a bill that would change the rules for reporting sexual assaults on college campuses.
AB 1433 would require that all instances of sexual assault reported to collegiate administrators or organizations be subsequently reported to the police unless the victim specifically requests a report not be filed.
Gatto said he was inspired to draft the bill after seeing numerous media reports concerning colleges across the country underreporting cases of sexual assault.
Last May, USC gained national attention when 16 students and alumni submitted a Title IX complaint to the Office for Civil Rights within the Dept.of Education regarding the university’s treatment of sexual assault victims and errors in its reporting and adjudication process. The University of California, Berkeley and Occidental College are under similar investigations.
“It appeared that university administrations were not investigating these crimes and instead trying to cover them up,” Gatto said. “Whenever you have something like that occur, you lessen the chance of the victim ever seeing justice, and you also leave the perpetrator out in the community to victimize somebody else. For both those reasons I think a law is necessary to treat victims with the dignity they deserve.”
Gatto said he and his staff spoke with sexual assault survivors throughout the state while drafting the bill. The reaction to the bill among his colleagues and among the community has been largely positive, and many people were shocked to learn about the loopholes and lack of continuity in the reporting process.
Alexa Schwartz, a senior majoring in theatre, is one of three students whose complaints are currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights. Schwartz speculated that she is skeptical that the mandate for police involvement comes more as a result of media pressure rather than a survivor request.
“It seems a little bit like this has been a recurring issue in the news,” Schwartz said. “People are always asking, ‘Why aren’t the police involved?’ That leads to this action of making sure the police are included when it’s not a survivor initiative.”
Schwartz cautions that the option to involve police should always be framed as a choice. Requiring the victim to specifically request police to not be involved puts pressure on the victim to do something that could be viewed as going against the norm.
“I think there can be specific language about how to go about it because so much power is being taken away from the survivor already,” Schwartz said. “If people know going forth and reporting is essentially the same thing as reporting to the police, it might deter people from reporting at all.”
Before AB 1433 is voted on, Gatto said it will likely appear before two policy committees: the Higher Education Committee and the Criminal Justice Committee. The bill contains an urgency clause, which stipulates the proposal must receive 67 percent of votes to pass rather than the majority. Unlike a typical bill, which could take up to a year to go into effect, if AB 1433 passes it would become law following the governor’s signature.
“It’s my hope that this bill will be the law of the land by next fall,” Gatto said. “I’m in the camp that something needed to be done yesterday. There is no such thing as too soon.”
Kaya Masler, executive co-director of the USC Women’s Assembly and a member of the Safer Campus Initiative, a group within the Women’s Assembly, said that Gatto’s office should continue its efforts to ensure that the bill can address all facets of the issue.
“I’m very impressed and appreciative of all of Assemblymember Gatto’s efforts on this issue,” she said. “He has made it a priority issue and I really appreciate that, but I don’t think that this bill gets to the heart of the problem. As long as his office keeps doing their research and reaching out to survivors and getting their perspectives, he’ll find the answers that he’s looking for.”
Gatto said he hopes the provisions in the bill will also address discrepancies in what is considered official reporting.
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires college campuses to release crime statistics. Gatto believes the annual report, which encompasses three years of crime data, helps prospective and current students as well as their parents. But in many cases the reported Clery numbers did not accurately reflect campus crime.
In September, the USC Dept. of Public Safety made adjustments in its Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report for forcible sex offenses not noted in the previous year’s report.
Effective Oct. 1 of last year, staff for the Center for Women and Men, which provides counseling for victims of sexual assault, are no longer designated as Campus Security Authorities, the title given to establishments that can file official reports of sexual assault. Gatto’s office said the new bill will likely require the Center for Women and Men to report sexual assaults to the police unless the victim requests otherwise.
Masler said discrepancies in Clery reporting can be avoided by providing victims with reporting forms and information about their rights.
“Issues of Clery can be resolved without mandating police involvement,” Masler said. “Victims should know their Clery rights and that all representatives that are required to report to Clery are reporting and that those are being reported correctly. There is a way to enforce Clery without making this extra provision that necessitates police involvement.”
As a rape survivor, Francesca Bessey, a junior majoring in international relations, said that the investigative process is both stressful and disrespectful to the person going through it but that she hopes the bill will help politicians begin to think about how the issue can be legally addressed.
“Having the option of an investigation of a rape in itself does not always represent justice,” Bessey said. “It unfortunately does not always end in justice and it can also lead to a series of obstacles and problems that investigations on college campuses don’t lead to; however, the effort to hold colleges and universities more accountable in the aftermath of an investigation is definitely commendable and I’m heartened by the efforts of Assemblymember Gatto to work directly with survivors.”
The bill itself applies to reporting willful homicide and robberies as well as hate crimes and sexual assaults. Gatto said the bill targets many areas of campus crime but improving the sexual assault reporting process is, at the moment, his main priority.
“I think we have a broad consensus among victims that this bill is a good balance, that it leaves everything up to the victim. It gives them some control back and it will also result in more perpetrators being pulled out of the community,” Gatto said. “There are already far too many sexual assaults on campuses. One is one too many and, generally, I think it’s going to take a lot of approaches. It’s going to take attitudinal shifts. It’s going to take educational efforts but this is one piece that the California legislature can do to change our laws to reflect better values.”

On Thursday, the Price School of Public Policy’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events hosted a lecture featuring Professor Erroll G. Southers on the threat of homegrown terrorism.
Homeland · Professor Erroll Southers speaks on the difficulty in pinpointing the main influence of terrorism, both domestic and global. – Carrie Sun | Daily Trojan
 
Acknowledging the attacks at the Los Angeles International Airport and Boston Marathon, Southers discussed the increase of homegrown terrorism threats.
“Even as foreign terrorists seek ways to harm U.S. citizens and interests, there is a growing threat from domestic extremists [who are] able to execute lethal attacks while eluding much of the U.S. homeland security apparatus,” Southers wrote in his new book Homegrown Violent Terrorism.
Southers served as President Obama’s first nominee for assistant secretary of the TSA. He noted in his lecture that it’s interesting that Obama is the first African-American president, has an Arabic sounding last name and a Muslim father.
“The average threats per day, the first year when he was in office, [was] 30 per day,” Southers said. “When President Bush was in office, it [was] five to 10 per day. Over 700 percent increase in the number of patriot groups occurred in the first three years of Obama’s administration.”
Southers addressed the difficulty of defining modern terrorism, noting that there are 109 definitions of terrorism, so placing it under one category is nearly impossible.
“There’s no internationally recognized words to define terrorism,” he said. “Globally, we cannot agree on what it is.”
Southers said though terrorism is highly prevalent, evidence is hard to collect. He said that it’s hard to pinpoint the main influence of terrorism because it is not always the result of individual action.
“When we are looking at this, we are looking at group behavior,” Southers said. “Over time, people will agree to [what] the majority is saying, which makes it hard to profile the prisoners. There is no profile you can get.”
Audience member Sisley Brunon, an alumna of USC, stressed that education on the issue of homegrown terrorism is important for self-protection.
“We need to look inward to protect our nation. Educate yourself the things that happened within the United States,” Brunon said. “In order to protect our future, and the growth of this nation, everyone needs to educate himself with what Dr. Southers taught today.”

On Wednesday, EmpoweredU, the mobile-first learning management system, announced that it will launch its pilot program at the Viterbi School of Engineering, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Rossier School of Education.
The launch will also involve eight other universities across the nation, including Clemson University,  Davis College of Business at Jacksonville University, Texas Southern University, University of San Francisco, University of California at Irvine, University of California at San Diego, Southern Arkansas University and Cambria-Rowe Business College.
The program provides the tools and features for an in-class mobile learning experience that will allow students to utilize online lectures, assignments, test administration, peer-to-peer interaction, discussion forums and more.
“EmpoweredU’s mission is to help universities provide learning anywhere, anytime, with any device. Our mobile learning platform offers a full solution to universities looking to embrace teaching and learning on the go,” EmpoweredU CEO Steve Poizner said in an interview with the Herald Online. Poizner is also on the board of councilors at the Rossier School.
Binh Tran, executive director of DEN@Viterbi expressed the mission of EmpoweredU in an email to the Daily Trojan.
“We expect EmpoweredU to enhance the mobile experience for our faculty and students,” he said.  “Many of our current tools and content are accessible now via mobile devices but we anticipate this system will allow students to be more organized in their coursework while balancing the demands of their career and personal lives.”
Tran also said that this new program will serve as an important gain to online students.
“The majority of our online students are working professionals and they can benefit from the mobility and engagement of this service, especially when they are enrolled in the same rigorous courses and requirements as their on-campus classmates,” he said.
The pilot program for EmpoweredU at USC allows Rossier to test the new technology with its professional development and continuing education programs.
“Steve Poizner on the Board of Councilors approached the dean’s office about the new program for mobile devices, and brought some demos that the faculty and administration were really impressed with,” said Cathryn Dhanatya, assistant dean for research and interim executive director for professional development.
Dhanatya said faculty and administrators were particularly impressed with the program’s ability to seamlessly move courses across mobile platforms and the creators’ willingness to design the program around Rossier’s needs.
“The main function will be that it allows us to experiment with the platform and see how robust it is at delivering content through a mobile platform,” she said.
Rossier’s partnership with EmpoweredU will allow the school to improve learning in urban environments.
“We’re interested in leveraging our strategic partnership to further and advance our mission,” Dhanatya said. “We want to provide online content that is high-quality and has an impact, and this partnership will allow us to do that.”
That’s the good initiative EmpoweredU is trying to take. It will not only reduce the cost factor but hassle that people encounter in offline learning.

USC Professor of Engineering and Director of the Center for Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies Behrokh Khoshnevis has developed a three-dimensional printer that can build houses in 24 hours.
Smart House · The cost of building a house through 3-D printing would be significally lower than in the case of regular construction. – Photo courtesy of Contour Crafting
Khoshnevis created a technology called “contour crafting,” a term he coined to describe a fabrication process that allows large-scale parts to be fabricated quickly using a      layer-by-layer technique.
The printer is equipped with a nozzle that spews out concrete and can build a home using a set computer pattern. This process allows a single house or a colony of houses, each customized, to be automatically constructed in a single run, with components such as conduits for electrical, plumbing and air-conditioning included.
Though this technology was developed several years ago, Khoshnevis has found a way to speed up the process by creating a printer that can produce thick layers of building material.
In the beginning of the development, it took several weeks to build a full-sized human sculpture. Now, after much research, the machine has been improved to build a 2,500 square foot house in a day.
“I’ve always been focused on ways of making things,” Khoshnevis said.
This is an example of platform technology, a technology that has applications in different domains, according to Khoshnevis. In the case of contour crafting, he feels most passionately about housing and how it can be commercialized to build houses rapidly in low-income areas.
Khoshnevis said the technology can create long-term housing and, more importantly, emergency housing in the case of natural disasters. He said about 40 million people around the world are uprooted because of disasters.
“We need a fast way of responding to those, so this [technology] is instrumental,” he said.
In addition, the cost of building a house through contour crafting would be significantly lower as there would be less labor involved than in the case of manual construction.
Other possible uses include building structures on other satellites and planets, such as the Moon or Mars. The technology has opened up this possibility due to its low cost and rapid production rate.
Though some say that this technology will lead to a reduction in jobs, the benefits will outweigh the potential disadvantages, according to Steven Nutt, chair of chemical engineering and materials science and director of the M.C. Gill Composites Center. He asserts that the prospect of customizable housing and the ability to make housing affordable are tremendous benefits.
“You can understand the appeal of the potential of the technology for construction,” Nutt said.
Khoshnevis is planning to establish a company to commercialize the technology more. He hopes to bring the basic technology to the market in order to build as many houses as needed.
Khoshnevis also predicts that it will take a few years for the product to become available for purchase.
Because there is very limited laboratory space, Khoshnevis and his team have been building small sections of the house model. The space does not allow for many models to be built to test out the improved product.
“If we build one house, we have to demolish [an existing] one,” he said.
Improvements are constantly being made, new tests conducted and building processes demonstrated.
Some of these pieces generated from the printer are currently being displayed at 10 museums around the world, including ones in New York and Spain.

Fresh off of their second national title in four years, the USC women’s water polo team topped the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation’s preseason poll. Four times since Jovan Vavic became the head coach of the men’s and women’s water polo teams at USC, he’s been able to coach both teams to a national championship in the same school year (1998-99, 2003-04, 2009-2010 and 2012-13).
Fearless leader · Coach Jovan Vavic has the opportunity to win national titles in men’s and women’s water polo for the fifth time. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
The poll predicts that Vavic is likely to accomplish the feat for a fifth time. After winning the national title with the men’s team this past December, the MPSF preseason poll narrowly predicted USC women’s team to finish first in the conference that has won every national championship since water polo became sanctioned as a varsity sport by the NCAA in 2001.
Much like last year’s national championship game, the team finished just a hair ahead of second-place Stanford. The Women of Troy beat Stanford 10-9 in overtime in last year’s national title bout and received four out of seven first place votes in the poll, with Stanford receiving the other three.
UCLA finished third in the poll, indicating that little has changed in the national landscape of women’s water polo in the last two decades. USC, UCLA and Stanford have combined to win all 13 of the national titles in the sport’s history, and the runner-up has also come from the trio 11 of those times.
Two years ago, it was Stanford that squeaked past USC in the 2012 title bout with a 6-4 win. But USC had the upper hand against the Cardinal in the 2010 final, which the Women of Troy also won 10-9.
Junior driver and last year’s MPSF player of the year Monica Vavic, daughter of the head coach, returns from last year’s team along with senior All-Americans Flora Bolonyai, Kaleigh Gilchrist, Madeline Rosenthal and Kelly Mendoza.
The Women of Troy open competition at the Triton Invitational in San Diego on Feb. 8. The team will also unveil the new Uytengsu Aquatics Center on March 7 against CSU Bakersfield.

During college football’s offseason, nearly every school participates in the “coaching carousel” to reshuffle their respective staffs.
Some teams only make a few adjustments. Others undergo widespread changes, which often occur after the arrival of a new head honcho on campus.
USC certainly falls under the latter category. Even by the most dramatic of standards, the Trojans have endured quite the whirlwind of departures and arrivals since former head coach Lane Kiffin was fired in September at Los Angeles International Airport. If there is indeed a “coaching carousel,” USC has a FastPass, and keeps coming back for another dizzying cycle.
But like a sugar-fueled child at the end of a trip to Disneyland, USC seems to have finally run out of energy for such rides.
With the hiring of Georgia’s Chris Wilson as defensive line coach on Wednesday, it appears Sarkisian has filled out his staff for the 2014 season. But it’s taken quite a journey to get to this point.
Consider that in the last four months, USC has not only had four head coaches (Kiffin, Ed Orgeron, Clay Helton, Steve Sarkisian), but four defensive line coaches — and entertained employing a fifth in Tosh Lupoi before it was revealed he might have violated NCAA rules at Washington under Sarkisian.
After Orgeron left the post to take over interim head-coaching duties, Pete Jenkins took over for the remainder of the season. When it became obvious to Sarkisian that he couldn’t feasibly bring Lupoi with him to USC without welcoming the dangerous gaze of the NCAA, he offered the job to Wilson, but was turned down. Sarkisian successfully convinced Bo Davis to leave Texas to join his staff — for six days, before Davis relocated to Alabama, citing “family reasons.” With his options quickly dissipating — it’s apparent  that Orgeron really didn’t want to return to the Trojan Family he supposedly adored unconditionally — Sarkisian set his sights back on Wilson. The former Georgia defensive line coach accepted, perhaps contingent upon a sizable salary increase, the second time around.
And that’s the transaction summary concerning just one coaching position.
Former special teams coach John Baxter and defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast received rave reviews throughout their tenures at USC, but they’ve been replaced by Johnny Nansen and Justin Wilcox, respectively — both holdovers from Sarkisian’s staff at Washington.
Such widespread turnover has some USC fans concerned that it might be difficult for the Trojans to pick up on new schemes quickly enough to succeed in their first season under Sarkisian. But there are also plenty of reasons to believe that USC could compete for the Pac-12 title immediately.
Firstly, offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Clay Helton and receivers coach Tee Martin were retained by Sarkisian. Though the offense won’t be running quite the same pro-style offense they have in the past, Helton showed in the Las Vegas Bowl — and, really, throughout the entire second half of the season — that he knows how to get the best out of redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, junior tailback Javorius Allen and junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor. Even if Kessler is replaced by redshirt freshman Max Browne and Allen ends up splitting his carries with the deep stable of USC running backs, Helton has proved himself a superb game-planner. His presence on the staff bodes well for the Trojans, as does Martin’s ability to recruit.
Secondly, it’s not as if the outsiders Sarkisian has hired are unproven scrubs.
In 2012, Wilcox’s first year at Washington, the Huskies ranked 31st in the nation in total defense after placing 106th in 2011. This past season, the Huskies finished second in the Pac-12 in sacks (41) and fourth in scoring defense (22.8 points allowed per game) with significantly less talent than the teams ranked above them (Stanford, Oregon, USC).
Wilson has shown he has what it takes to fill Orgeron’s large shoes. Like his predecessor, Wilson possesses Southern roots — he served as Mississippi State’s defensive coordinator from 2010-2012 — and recruited several touted prospects to Georgia in his short time there. He inherited a Bulldogs defensive line that lost five players to the 2013 NFL Draft -— and would have several more succumb to injuries throughout the 2013 season — yet still managed to help guide the defense to record 33 sacks, good for 29th in the nation.
He’ll be walking into a much better situation at USC. The Trojans have arguably the best defensive line prospect for the 2015 NFL Draft in junior defensive end Leonard Williams, who could be a standout defensive end or a defensive tackle with a knack for pass rushing in Wilcox’s 4-3 defense. USC will also boast breakout defensive end senior J.R. Tavai (8 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks in eight starts) and a pair of behemoth defensive tackles in redshirt junior Antwaun Woods and former five-star recruit Kenny Bigelow, who redshirted as a freshman this past season.
Still, USC’s success in 2014 is far from guaranteed. The Trojans will still be hamstrung by their last season under NCAA scholarship restrictions, which sting even more with the losses of Uko, Marqise Lee, Dion Bailey, Xavier Grimble and Marcus Martin to the NFL Draft — roster spots that cannot be filled by other players according to USC’s probation terms.
It does seem assured, however, that USC won’t have to endure another roller-coaster season in 2014. They probably won’t experience an extensive ride on the coaching carousel next offseason, either.
But that won’t stop the Trojan faithful from speculating as soon as the Sarkisian regime suffers their first big loss. Because if USC fans learned anything in 2013, it’s to expect the unexpected.

After a 2012-2013 campaign that saw the Trojans advance to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament, USC’s men’s tennis team heads into the first tournament of the spring season ranked No. 4 in the nation.
Back and forth · Junior Roberto Quiroz figures to play a key role in the Trojans’ push for their fifth national title in six seasons. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans will be competing at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Westlake, Calif. this weekend, facing off against players from schools including UCLA, Stanford, Baylor and Loyola Marymount.
“It’s a pretty special tournament, especially this year because we have three teams that’ll probably be top-five in the country,” head coach Peter Smith said. “UCLA, USC and Baylor are all great teams, and then Stanford is also there. They’re historically a really great team too.”
The No. 1 player in the nation, UCLA’s Clay Thompson, is the top seed in the tournament, and might face USC’s junior Eric Johnson in the second round should they both advance. Johnson is unseeded in the tournament and will face Mate Zsiga of Baylor in the first round.
In last year’s Sherwood Collegiate Cup, then-junior Ray Sarmiento took home the singles title, while Johnson and then-freshman Max de Vroome were runners-up in doubles competition, falling to a team from UCLA in the championship match.
Due to their success in the fall season, during which they won the ITA Southwest Regional doubles championship and traveled to the ITA National Indoor Championships, Johnson and de Vroome earned the second seed at the tournament.
Smith says this weekend’s tournament is important for the team because it gives the players a chance to get in a lot of practice in one weekend.
Junior Roberto Quiroz, who enters the spring season ranked No. 113 in the nation in singles, is excited to get back into the tennis environment. Quiroz’s impressive fall season earned him the sixth seed on the singles side of the tournament.
“I’m playing singles and doubles,” Quiroz said. “I’m playing doubles with [freshman] Connor Farren who just got into the school … and so I’m excited to play with him and I think it’s going to be a good [weekend] for the team.”
Even though they are playing together for the first time at USC, Quiroz and Farren are slotted fourth on the doubles side.
The team’s two highest-ranked players, Sarmiento (No. 10) and junior Yannick Hanfmann (No. 32) will not be taking part in this weekend’s tournament. The pair, who each had success in their fall tournaments, are both “a little banged up,” according to Smith. Still, the rest of the spring season looks promising for the Trojans.
“This is a very young team,” Sarmiento said. “I’m looking forward to competing with them on the court.”
Indeed, the start of the spring season hits off with a set of fresh faces, as three of the team’s freshmen are participating in the weekend’s event.
“They are dying to prove themselves,” Smith said.
One such freshman is spring enrollee Farren, who will be participating in the tournament after practicing with the team for less than a week.
“I hope to just get used to the college environment and to support all my teammates as much as I can,” Farren said.
Farren earned the No. 8 seed in this tournament.
The Trojans are accustomed to being at the top of the rankings, having won four consecutive national championships from 2009-2012. Still, they insist that their current No. 4 ranking is the last thing on their minds.
“It’s something that other people look at, but how my team is doing, the culture of my team, all of that stuff is the stuff that matters,” Smith said. “It’s not the first ranking, it’s the last ranking that matters.”
As the new season kicks off, there’s only one number the team is concerned about.
“Our ultimate focus is what our ranking is going to be after NCAAs, which is No. 1,” Sarmiento said.

After taking on Arizona and Arizona State in away games, the Women of Troy look to continue to build on their strong start in Pac-12 conference play as they return home this weekend to take on the Oregon schools.
USC (11-6, 4-1 Pac-12) will  first welcome Oregon State (10-6, 2-2) on Friday night before facing off against Oregon in a Sunday matinee.
Steady hand · Senior forward Cassie Harberts has paced the Women of Troy with 14.5 points per game this season. First-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s team is second in the Pac-12 standings. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The team has been on a roll lately, winning four of their last five games with their only loss during that stretch coming on the road in overtime against Arizona State.
A lot of the Women of Troy’s early success can be attributed to the emergence of the team’s ‘X factor’ in junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, who has doubled her production from last season. After putting up a game-high 16 points against Arizona last Sunday, Vaioletama ranks as the team’s third leading scorer (9.5 ppg) and top rebounder (7.9 rpg).
They currently sit in the top tier of the conference in second place, as No. 4 Stanford, No. 15 California and unranked Washington State are tied for first with undefeated records.
First-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke is not letting the team get too ahead of itself though, even after it’s hot start.
“We are going to continue to take it one game at a time,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Oregon State comes into the game as a middle-of-the-pack team, while Oregon has not fared well so far, dropping it’s first four games in conference play.
Vaioletama asserts that Cooper-Dyke is the biggest reason why she and her team have been markedly improved as of late. The Women of Troy won only seven Pac-12 games last year.
“It’s a blessing to have her as a coach,” Vaioletama said. “She breaks down everything for us and makes sure we don’t overlook all of the little things.”
In their Friday tilt with the Beavers, the Women of Troy should expect a confident Oregon State team that is coming off back-to-back wins against their in-state rival Oregon, 88-80 on the road and 84-70 in Corvallis. USC has gotten the best of the Beavers in the teams’ last two meetings, defeating them in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament, 64-57, and 56-55 in the regular season.
Sophomore guard Jamie Weisner is the Beaver’s leading scorer, averaging slightly over 15 points a game through the first half of the season.
The Ducks, on the other hand, are still looking to get their first win in conference play and are looking to avenge a 4-27 overall record in 2013. They will look to get back on track against the Women of Troy, but have not defeated them since 2010.
Oregon is led by a young and talented guard, freshman Chrishae Rowe, who leads all Ducks scorers with over 22 points a game. She tandems with 6-foot-3 sophomore forward Jillian Alleyne, who is second in scoring with 21 points a game. She also brings down a team-high 14 rebounds per game, averaging a double-double.
They will have to take on Los Angeles’ other team, the UCLA Bruins, on Friday night before matching up with USC in the second game of their Southern California road trip.
As for preparing for the Oregon schools, Cooper-Dyke explained how the two schools both like to get quickly up and down the court so it’s going to be important that the Women of Troy counter their up-tempo style.
“We need to play good transition defense and try and keep the game in the half court,” Cooper-Dyke said.
This home stand marks two imperative games for the Women of Troy, as the following week they head up north to the Bay Area to take on two of the country’s top teams in Stanford and Cal.

Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, pack the place. They sway to the rhythm, thrashing their hips, closing their eyes and mouthing the words. But the place is silent. Bodies move in unison like an impeccable orchestra playing in harmony — only no one can see who is conducting. Welcome to a silent disco.
Most believe silent discos first spread throughout festivals in Europe in the ’90s with the advent of new technologies and came to the States in the mid-2000s, but others document the trend as far back as 1969. Some attribute its origins to addressing urban issues such as noise control; others point to environmental concerns associated with outdoor public performance.
But no matter where it started — or why — the idea of silent disco is a spectacularly silly, strangely futuristic one: people dancing to music on wireless headphones, broadcasted through a radio transmitter instead of a sound system.
Robbie Kowal, founder of Silent Frisco, the company that he said has “pushed the concept harder, faster and further than anyone in the U.S.,” first stumbled across the phenomenon at a festival where he was DJ-ing in 2006. He then began Silent Frisco in San Francisco and has since expanded to Los Angeles.
“What I realized immediately was that there was a direct connection between the artist and the listener,” Kowal said. “They could hear exactly what I was hearing, as an artist, which is very unusual in a performance venue. They have control of their own volume and often they have choice in what they’re listening to, as well. Those things are mentally powerful.”
Kowal insists that the act isn’t awkward, as one might expect — it’s just universal curiosity, followed by an unmatched level of enjoyment.
“The second they put those headphones on, you see their faces light up,” he said. “And that’s what’s fascinating about this. Most music events with loudspeakers — usually 10 to 20 percent of people at the event are actively listening to the music. They are distracted by other things and by other people. When you put those headphones on, it’s easy to lose yourself in the music. When we have dance music, we see 95 percent of our audience actively listening and dancing. That’s unheard of in clubs.”
After falling in love with the concept, Kowal decided to go big with it. He put on a national silent disco tour that reached 15 states in just more than three weeks, mostly in the Northeast region of the United States.
“In some of those cases, [the silent discos] were abject failures — nobody knew what the heck was going on, nobody came out,” Kowal said. “[In] some of those cases, they were tremendous successes. Either way, we kind of laid the groundwork for the growth of the concept in subsequent years.”
And the company shows no signs of slowing down. Clients range from festivals to museums, from weddings and private parties to cultural institutions. Silent Frisco has done large, corporate finance installations for companies such as Macworld, Yahoo and Google. They are even responsible for the first activation of silent disco in many unique locations — beaches, parks, mountaintops and skating rinks.
In other words, there seems to be no place that is safe from an invisible, penetrating beat, and no person safe from its charms. Kowal says that the average age range for an event featuring DJ music is 21 to 35, but when it comes to silent disco, anything goes — and everyone comes.
“Parents like silent disco because it gives them the option to control volume — they can put the headphones on their kids’ ears and know that they aren’t going to lose their hearing,” Kowal said. “Also, the events are in beautiful places, so we have a really nice mix of young people who want to party and families who want to do something interesting on an afternoon to keep their kids entertained. These are wholesome outings that everybody can enjoy.”
After having first put on a silent disco in Los Angeles for a birthday party, and noting the demand of an untapped market, the company began a monthly silent disco series at Wilshire in Santa Monica in the model of a DJ battle — two DJs spinning simultaneously to compete for listeners.
The monthly series returns tonight at Wilshire, featuring a battle between the music of LCD Soundsystem and Talking Heads, and will last for four months.
Given the receptiveness to the concept by Angelenos, the decision to bring back the silent disco was simple.
“I believe that San Franciscans are used to seeing weird, novel technology — strange people doing strange things on a daily basis,” Kowal said. “It’s just “It’s just part of our culture up here. When you see a bunch of people with headphones, banging along with the music, that’s not a typical L.A. experience. It’s a very immersive, and very communal, and a very silly and frivolous and fun thing. I think the L.A. audience doesn’t get enough of that, and we give them a great outlet.”

“Do you plan on studying abroad?”
It’s a question that every advisor asks, and it’s a decision that all USC students must face. It seems like just yesterday I was walking into my first advising appointment as an eager freshman and answering that question with a firm yes. Now it’s two years later, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I’m headed to London in a few days.
The answer to that big question was relatively simple for my freshman self. Before coming to USC, a lot of people had told me going abroad for a semester was the best part of their college experience. There is hardly ever another time in most people’s lives when they can pick up and temporarily move to another country for a relatively low cost and no responsibilities, aside from occasionally going to class. “Why not?” I thought. “It’s just a semester.”
Preparations for this journey have been underway for months. I’m sure anyone who has studied abroad will tell you that their inbox has been flooded with informational PowerPoint presentations from their program advisor about things such as what to pack, health insurance and adjusting to culture shock. There have been a few exciting moments, such as choosing classes and finding out the address for our new apartment — or flat, as they call it in the U.K. — but mostly everything pre-departure has just felt like a lot of work. Until very recently, this trip felt ages away, but now I’m ready to finish with these preparations and hop on that plane.
Yet, even though I can’t wait to explore some new places and have an adventure or two, I understand why many people opt to forego studying abroad. A lot can change in a semester, and most of us only get eight before going off to the “real world.” As the excitement of living in a new place grows closer to becoming a reality, so does the sadness of leaving behind the Trojan Family.
And that’s not all I’m leaving behind. Specifically, I’ve been panicking for the past few months at the prospect of not having my beloved iPhone available 24/7. I mean, my phone will technically be with me, but most students abroad choose to buy a less expensive phone when they arrive overseas and communicate with friends and family online or via free calling and texting apps.
Though a seemingly minor sacrifice in light of the exciting journey I’m about to embark upon, I never realized how much I rely on my cell phone until I thought about not being able to use it for five months. No more calling my parents whenever I want. No more texting. No more asking Siri questions I know she doesn’t know the answer to just for kicks. No more reaching into my pocket to grasp that familiar rectangle and know that at any moment I can talk to anyone or find out anything.
This dilemma reflects a larger concern in the days leading up to a semester abroad: staying connected to people at home. It might be a little dramatic to think that leaving for a semester will cause all your friends to forget you exist, but it is hard to avoid the inevitable fear of missing out, especially when you can’t shoot a text to them every once in a while to remind them that you’re still around.
Each semester, Facebook news feeds fill with photos of friends standing in front of stunning foreign landscapes and various landmarks, but I can imagine that these posts aren’t just to make you jealous of their trip while you toil away in a lecture hall. Remaining active on social media sites seems to be one of the only ways to remain visible among those you have left behind — pretty daunting coming from the plugged-in, interconnected society we live in.
I’ve talked to a lot of people going abroad who have told me that they can’t wait to go, and don’t get me wrong, I’m really excited, too. I’ve come to realize that being disconnected will probably be one of the best parts of studying abroad. Not being able to hear about all the stuff you’re missing forces you to focus on all the amazing things right in front of you — something that’s not so easy for college students.
When it comes down to it, we all find our own way to keep in touch while still making the most of a new experience. In my case, this column will keep me connected to USC from afar. No doubt there will be a lot to share in the coming months. But for now, it’s time to pack.

The Odd Couple, Neil Simon’s magnum opus, is being revived in the L.A. area at Santa Monica’s Morgan-Wixson Theatre. The Odd Couple, which premiered on Broadway in 1965 and was adapted to a television sitcom from 1970-75, follows the lives of two single men — one sloppy, the other neat — through a couple of months in which they live together.
Odd Couple · Female actors dominate Rothhaar’s The Odd Couple, Female Version. The play, a unique adaptation of the classic The Odd Couple, boasts an award-winning director and an excellent cast.

This particular rendition of the celebrated play will be directed by Michael Rothhaar, whose directing credits include USC’s 2008 production of Pride and Prejudice.
In the original production, which most adaptations — including this one — stick to fairly closely, Felix Ungar, a neat freak with a neurotic side, moves in with his friend Oscar Madison after he and his wife get a divorce and she kicks him out.
This version of The Odd Couple is not the original; it is, instead, Simon’s updated version, taking place in the ’80s and following two female, rather than male, divorcees.
Dubbed The Odd Couple, Female Version, this arrangement of the play portrays the same themes and characters, but with a mostly female cast.
Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison become Florence Ungar and Olive Madison. The famous poker nights, which frame the play, become games of Trivial Pursuit. But the humor, drawn from Florence’s neat-freak personality clashing with Olive’s messy apartment, remains.
The Morgan-Wixson’s spacious stage will accommodate an elaborate production design, bringing Olive’s apartment to life. Rothhaar cites the venue’s size as a perfect venue to punctuate Simon’s frantic slapstick.
The cast includes Ariella Fiore, who is known for her roles on the TV series Shameless and Bondjamesbond, and Charlotte Edmondson, who has had multiple roles in various theater productions, movies and TV shows.  The production is being produced by William Wilday, who has directed and produced nearly 100 shows in Southern California and Pennsylvania. This stage, this cast and this play find a home in Rothhaar’s talented hands.
Rothhaar has been directing productions since 1985, but this is his first time directing The Odd Couple, even though it is his favorite Simon play. His relationship to Simon’s work began around the same time as his interest in theater, while he was still in high school and he saw The Last of the Red Hot Lovers during its original Broadway run.
“I’m a big fan of Simon, and I think sometimes people forget, especially as we get further away from his really productive period, that he’s a master of structure and a master of making comedy come out of real human situations,” Rothhaar said. “He writes comedy that comes out of real desperate situations. I saw [The Odd Couple, Female Version] on Broadway … the original production. I’ve never directed any version of The Odd Couple, and I thought, ‘Here’s one [that I could direct].’”
Rothhaar hopes that his production will introduce Simon to a younger generation. When Rothhaar was young, Simon had four plays on Broadway at the same time — a rare feat. Rothhaar hopes that his direction will express Simon’s talent and comedic insight. Influenced by his unique and exceedingly precise directing style, the director promises that his cast lives up to expectations.
“I have a very distinct way of wanting to work. I think that the best way to discover a play is actually performing it on your feet,” Rothhaar said. “I don’t like a lot of time reading around the table, especially with a very spastic comedy [like this one]. As soon as the actors start to inhabit the environment, the better the experience for the audience. The cast has been with me all the way, there’s been no resistance. Each one brings an enormous amount to the table on their own.”
The talented cast is more than capable of putting on a captivating show, especially in the case of this production. But Rothhaar always wants to make absolutely sure that the script is followed exactly, especially with The Odd Couple.
“I tell actors, ‘Learn this play verbatim,’ particularly [for Neil Simon plays]. If you get the emphasis of the line [wrong], if you throw an extra syllable in, it’s going to be terrible. You wouldn’t add an extra line to the ‘To be or not to be’ speech if you were doing Hamlet, and you wouldn’t add an extra note or rest to Beethoven. And I’m particularly strict about that,” Rothhaar said.
Simon’s resume includes more than 30 plays and collaboration with Larry Gelbart, creator of M*A*S*H, and Woody Allen on Sid Caesar’s “Your Show of Shows.”
This impressive collecton of work, in combination with Rothhaar’s 30 years of directing experience, ensures that this play will be one to see. Despite it dealing with divorcees and issues particular to the 1980s, Rothhaar believes it will be a treat for USC students, especially for those who have experienced divorce firsthand in their families.
“It can be therapeutic, if you have been in the middle of a divorce or been a child of a divorce, to see this play,” Rothhaar said. “You might recognize your parents somewhere. Is it going to change your life like Laramie Project or Angels in America? No. But it’s great to see what makes people tick, and what makes people funny.”
 
The production opens on Jan. 18 and runs till Feb. 9. The Morgan-Wixson Theater is a 30-minute drive from campus. Student tickets are $18 and can be purchased online.
This post has been updated to show that Charlotte Edmondson is not a native of London.

Deep in the Blue Mountains of Australia, the four-piece alternative band Cloud Control was formed in 2007. Seven years and two albums later, Cloud Control is ready to take on the United States with their latest tour in promotion of their recently released LP, Dream Cave.

Though the album Dream Cave was created while the band nestled into the countryside of England for some creative sessions, the album’s sounds have worldly influence, successfully creating a sonic blend that is uniquely its own. West Coast harmonies overlie the dreamy whirl of today’s European electronica and a past generation’s psychedelic rock — strongly justifying the album title Dream Cave.
Cloud Control has been successful enough to open for bands including Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend and Weezer, among others. The band is now following in the footsteps of these bands and headlining its own American tour, hoping to reach the success seen by the bands it once opened for.
Though just a few dates in, lead singer Jeremy Kelshaw is loving the energy and feedback the band has received so far while promoting its latest album in North America, particularly noting the full house of fans who came out to the show in Chicago the previous day.
“The last European tour, there were two girls who didn’t know each other before and became friends during the show. Afterwards, we took the night off to hang out with them, even having lunch the next day.” It’s that type of connection that Kelshaw loves about music — he isn’t looking to produce fans, but to make friends.
The four-piece band met only once to rehearse before embarking on their new tour.
“We had one rehearsal and we just sounded good,” Kelshaw said.
And though only one rehearsal for a cross-country tour would typically come across as a sign of being unprepared, the lack of necessary rehearsals for Cloud Control only proves their natural talent and cohesiveness as a band.
“There’s a lot of passion you will see that comes out in our performance,” Kelshaw said.
What Cloud Control doesn’t do is force songs into their live set that do not sound good in a live environment.
“We set out to perform songs that work in a live situation,” Kelshaw said. “If a track from the album doesn’t work, we’ll either find a different song to perform or tweak it to sound good in a live setting, which ends up making it fresh for all of us.”
Cloud Control will be performing just minutes away from USC’s campus this Wednesday, Jan. 22 at The Satellite. Tickets are on sale now for $10 at thesatellitela.com.

In a controversial decision, the American Studies Association moved to boycott Israeli universities last December, accusing Israel of denying academic freedom to Palestinians, according to the Los Angeles Times. Instead, the act seems to be a contradiction; by its very nature, it threatens the academic freedom it claims to protect.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The ASA states that its boycott is aimed at Israeli “institutions that have abetted in the destruction of the Palestinian right of academic freedom for decades,” according to its press release. Carolyn Karcher, a member of the ASA, wrote in a L.A. Times column that the ASA resolution addresses that Israel’s “true assaults on academic freedom,” such as the allocation of less funding to the Palestinian schools within Israel, place limits on Palestinian university professors to travel abroad and prevent visits from international faculty. She also stated that Palestinian students “of all ages endure harassment at military checkpoints.”
Ironically, the ASA’s boycott threatens the very freedom of academic expression that it claims to protect. Molly Corbett, president of the American Council on Education, which covers 1,800 institutions, issued a statement saying that “such actions are misguided and greatly troubling, as they strike at the heart of academic freedom.”
More than 90 U.S. colleges have issued statements rejecting the ASA’s decision to boycott, according to the Jerusalem Post. Among those colleges are Columbia University, Dartmouth College and Harvard University. Of the more than 90 colleges, at least five have withdrawn from the ASA, according to the New York Times.
Critics of the boycott have also been quick to point out that Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, is the only country the ASA has singled out. What about Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey, all of whom have committed violations of academic freedom and human rights? It’s incredibly discriminatory to isolate Israel.
In opposing this boycott, discrete measures must be taken. Boycott the boycotters, as Alan Dershowitz and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg did seven years ago during a British academic boycott of Israel, in which they wrote an open letter stating that any boycott of Israel was a boycott on them. That goes to show that boycotting academic “institutions” doesn’t limit the attack on just the Israeli universities. Though ASA supporters maintain that Israeli academic institutions, not individual Israeli scholars, are the sole targets of the boycott, they seem to forget that institutions are collectives of individuals. Academic freedom is about a collective of people — when institutions are singled out, so are the individuals.
There is no easy solution to an issue that entangles two states that share a complex relationship. The academic boycott only complicates things, ignoring the difficult reality of life in today’s Middle East by reaching for a simple solution that is, by its own nature, counterproductive to any progress toward the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Palestinians are being starved to death. But this is not happening in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. Nor is it taking place in Israel.
Rather, this is happening in an Arab country, Syria, while the international community continues to turn a blind eye to the tragedy.
At least 15 Palestinians have died from starvation since last September in the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said, “We have received reports over the weekend that at least five more Palestinian refugees in the besieged refugee camp of Yarmouk in Damascus have died due to malnutrition, bringing the total number of reported cases (of starvation) up to 15.”
According to reports from Syria, some 20,000 Palestinians living in Yarmouk face death from starvation as a result of the siege on the camp that began last July.
Yarmouk has been under siege by the Syrian army after a large number of gunmen belonging to the Syrian opposition found shelter inside the camp.
Yet it is not only the Syrians who are besieging the camp. A radical Palestinian group called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, which is loyal to Bashar Assad, is also taking part in the siege.
Human rights activists say the Syrian authorities are refusing to allow aid into the camp, creating a severe humanitarian crisis.
Ruth,
I know you’re not really interested in facts, but I thought I’d print the following excerpt for those who do care about truth.
……………..
Globally, the story is the same. Out of the 57 nations which comprise the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, only three rise to the level of flawed democracies, according to the 2010 Democracy Index by The Economist.[7] 
With the exception of communist and former communist countries, Islamic nations impose the highest level of government restrictions on religion. 
Among the predominantly Islamic countries in the middle east and North Africa, 80% have anti-blasphemy laws and 60% of these nations enforce them.[8] Democracy, individual liberty, free speech, toleration, and equality are simply not consistent – or even compatible – with traditional Islamic theology and Shariah law.
So don’t blame Israel or any other entity for Islam’s inability to lead its people through means other than brute force.
What would MLK think of the way Israel treat the Palestinians?
The only thing the ASA Boycott is a threat to is Israel’s ability to keep denying basic human rights to the Palestinian people.  
Everyone should be boycotting everything Israeli just as we did with the Apartheid South African Regime, that is if you believe everyone is created equal in the eyes of God.
Isreal is not a pariah state no matter how much you’d want it to be, and there is certainly no holocaust done to the palaestinians. (sorry,but proof by repeated assertion of lies is no proof at all)
The number of palestinians killed in one decade is far less than the number of civilians killed by the sirian regime every month.
This number of course includes the palestinians that died while blowing up buses killing thousands of Israelis. So much for holocaust/genocide palestinian/leftist propaganda
Of course the ASA would not consider boycotting siria or palestinian universities (like Al Quds university) where nazi parades and praising of suicide bombers are performed.
South African institutions paid for their part in apartheid so must Israeli institutions.  Israel is a pariah state that dehumanizes the Palestinians–something has to be done and a simple boycott is just that: a simple act of protest against a very monstrous society that endorses the actions of the Israeli government towards those it wants to abolish. Someone has to do something to stop this monstrous non-stop holocaust of the Palestinian homeland–that’s right holocaust. It’s undeniable–no excuses acceptable. This is simple straight colonization of Palestine by Israel. The US Government does not have the guts to do anything because of the pressure of AIPAC on scared self-interested members of Congress. The academic community has a long history of not bowing to political pressure that cows lesser leaders. Hats off to this very necessary and righteous boycott.
The BDS movement and the academic boycott of Israel is counter productive to any real effort for peace. Since Israel was founded her Arab neighbors have threatened to drive the Jews into the sea and another holocaust. Peace can only come from Israel trusting a partner committed to peace.  The plight of the Palestinians has been caused by manipulative Arab Governments who use them as political pawns in international politics.  Israel has done what it has to to protect it’s citizens from suicide attacks and rockets aimed at women and children.  If the academic lefties who voted to boycott Israel had any integrity they would be boycotting Syria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the fifty other countries we could all name who really do repress their populations.  Would Palestinians be “dehumanized” if they were not focused on destroying Israel?  Time to wake up and take a page from Gandhi, non violence, not rockets.

The Dec. 16 vote by the American Studies Association to boycott Israeli academic institutions has been met with widespread criticism, with many university presidents — including USC’s own President C. L. Max Nikias — publicly denouncing the boycott. Most of this criticism, however, is based on a flawed understanding of what the boycott is all about.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
As the ASA’s public statement reads, the academic boycott seeks to protest “the illegal occupation of Palestine, and the infringements of the right to education of Palestinian students and the academic freedom of Palestinian scholars and students in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel.”
Such a resolution is not an attack on academic freedom. Rather, it is precisely the repeated denial of scholarly freedom to Palestinians living under occupation that makes such a resolution all the more necessary.
The reality on the ground is that Palestinian students are denied the academic freedom as a direct result of living under occupation. These students are subject to frequent school closures, unprovoked arrests and are often denied freedom of exit, even when earning a scholarship to study abroad. This boycott means to bring attention to the frequent assaults on Palestinians’ academic freedom — not to infringe on the academic freedom of their Israeli colleagues.
On the contrary, the boycott’s guidelines encourage collaboration. Individual Israeli academics, students or cultural workers are still able to participate in the ASA conference and to give public lectures on campuses.
The connection between Israel’s academic institutions and its government agents perpetuating the occupation is hard to ignore. Both Haifa University and Hebrew University have special military intelligence and training programs for Israel’s secret service, the Shin Bet. Hebrew University’s Mount Scopus campus itself is partially built on occupied East Jerusalem.
Moreover, this boycott isn’t about singling out Israel as the world’s sole occupying force. There are, unfortunately, many violators of human rights on the world stage. What distinguishes Israel, however, is the role that the United States plays in underwriting its violations of international law. Despite the reality of millions of Palestinians living under occupation and despite the fact that Israel’s blockade on Gaza is a clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention’s prohibitive articles against the collective punishment of civilians, the United States sends Israel $3.1 billion per year in military aid.
Perhaps boycott isn’t the best solution. Perhaps it only galvanizes its opponents and perpetuates polarity. But, regardless if one disagrees with the effectiveness of the boycott, slamming the ASA as anti-Semitic or labeling its Jewish supporters as “self-hating Jews” are serious and troubling accusations. Such statements go to feed the faulty assumptions that: First, any criticism of Israel is synonymous to anti-Semitism and, second, that all Jewish people take the same position on this highly contested issue. Neither could be more inaccurate.
The international community continually condemns the occupation and the European Union imposes sanctions on Israeli settlements. If we allow condemnation of the occupation here, there is no reason academics can’t take part as well.

Hi Yasmeen,
You are correct in saying that criticism of Israel, BDS campaigning  is not necessarily anti-Semitism, yet no where do you say that it also can be. Your comments with regard to many items indicates you either have either never been to Israel or you choose to ignore realities that exist or simply have an emotional tie to what and how you view the Israeli/ Palestinian issues.
When you refer to Palestinian occupied lands in East Jerusalem, please tell me when there was a Palestinian State or Country, who were its elected Government or officials, what was its constitution, its geographic boundaries, and what was its currency. Simply there has never been a Palestinian country.
Assuming you have answers for the above, then I would also like you to answer which other countries in the world have territories that have been won by war(all of Europe to start with) that have returned the land to its original owners.
I assume when you are referring to University Students you are referring to those that study in universities in so called occupied West Bank or unoccupied Gaza. So, as Gaza is unoccupied and technically part of Egypt and the West Bank is Jordanian lands your Boycotts should be for Egyptian and Jordanian Universities.
If you are referring to Arab/Israeli’s or Palestinian/Israeli’s that go to Israeli universities and enjoy all the facilities the same as any other student irrespective of Ethnicity, race or religion, you have nothing to boycott over but rather should be praising Israel for how its universities conduct themselves.
There is a reason that Israel was not invited to Nelson Mandela’s funeral. One stands for oppression while the other stands for freedom and human rights.
We should all boycott Israel until it begins to treat the Palestinians with basic human respect.

“We throw together a variety of acts to keep people entertained, interested and excited to come back to school,” Andrew Clark of the Special Events Committee said. “This is Program Board’s first big event of the year, and we like to make it big.”
Variety Hour has become an annual tradition for Program Board.
“This is our third annual Variety Hour,” Clark said. “We’re happy to keep it going. Last year we had Pentatonix and that was huge. We knew this year that we wanted to do it a third time, so we started to look at who we wanted to bring in.”
Headlining this year’s performance was YouTube sensation Alex Goot, a 25-year-old singer-songwriter from New York. Goot performed a popular rendition of Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles” and also some of his original songs.
Special Events Director Kim Chu discussed how Goot came to be hired.
“We were brainstorming acts to bring in, and we thought, ‘why not invite a YouTube star?’” Chu said. “So we went ahead and contacted him, and thankfully he accepted.”
Other acts included a magic show and a hip-hop performance from USC’s Break Through dance crew. Brittany Kuhne, a sophomore majoring in human biology was among the dance crew’s fans.
“We came to watch one of our friends in Break Through, but we stayed for the hypnosis,” Kuhne said.
The comedic hypnosis show by James Kellogg Jr. was a crowd favorite.
“This is the man who hypnotized famous tattoo artist Kat Von D to quit smoking,” said Derek Hughes, the magician and emcee of the show.
Kellogg’s show was a bonding experience for students who volunteered to be hypnotized. They found themselves snuggling, dancing and even stripping in front of the audience.
“My favorite part had to be the finale [of the hypnosis show]. A kid started taking off his clothes. I couldn’t believe it,” said Andrew Menard, a junior majoring in business administration. “I came tonight because I’d never been before, but I was not expecting to see ten people fall asleep on each other on stage.”
Attendance was down from last year, when ushers had to turn dozens of students away after the ballroom was filled to capacity.
“Last year, we had a lot more time to publicize so we had a full house,” Chu said. “This year, the contracts got signed a little bit later, which kept us from being able to publicize until after the school year had already started back up.”
Still, as in previous years, the event was a hit among student attendees.
“The show was really awesome,” said Laura Morine, a freshman majoring in geology. “The magician was great. It was some of the best magic I had ever seen. Break Through was fantastic. Overall, I thought it was an awesome show.”
Program Board encourages students to be on the lookout for the events they have planned for the rest of the year.
“We have a lot coming up for the spring semester,” Chu said. “There’s going to be Springfest from Program Board’s Concerts Committee, Special Events has Taste of Downtown L.A. coming up in February and Performing Arts is putting on Dueling Pianos at the end of January. It’s going to be a great year.”
Updated to show that the event took place Wednesday night, not Tuesday. The article quoted Daniel Clark when in fact his name is Andrew Clark.

The USC University Park Campus is now the home of 12 historical monuments.
On Dec. 11, the Los Angeles City Council officially named 12 of USC’s buildings Historical Cultural Monuments.
The newly distinguished buildings include the Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Family Home, Bovard Administration Building, 3440 Hope Street warehouse, Gwynn Wilson Student Union, Mudd Hall of Philosophy, the Physical Education Building, Doheny Memorial Library, Allan Hancock Foundation Building, Olin Hall of Engineering, University Religious Center, Von KleinSmid Center and the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
These buildings join USC’s Widney Alumni House, which was built in 1880.
Monumental · Bovard Auditorium is one of the buildings that garnered historic status on Dec. 11. Other buildings with this honor include the Gwynn Wilson Student Union and the Doheny Memorial Library.Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Each of these buildings contains significant historical and cultural components within their architecture that granted them the appropriate designation.
Mudd Hall is a Romanesque Revival building with decorative gargoyles and a three-winged courtyard that surrounds the building. The Von KleinSmid Center was designed in the New Formalism style. The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the newest building on the list to be given the designation, embodies the Late Modern style.
Brian League, executive director of real estate development for USC, explained that the recent environmental impact report for the university’s master plan identified these 12 buildings to be eligible as Historical Cultural Monuments.
“The city required that we list them for the listing,” League said.
This requirement was the condition the city gave in order to approve the new developments on campus.
These buildings never made it to historical status in the past.
“Having the designation doesn’t give us any financial advantage,” League said.
Having such a namesake would allow the real estate’s owners to receive tax credits, but there are no tax advantages from the designation because USC is a non-profit school.
According to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning website, the City of Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Ordinance is responsible for recognizing and protecting these Historical National Monuments.
There are currently more than 1,000 Historical-Cultural Monuments in the City of Los Angeles, and permits for any alterations to or potential demolition of the buildings containing this designation must be presented to the Heritage Commission before they can be accepted. The Commission also reserves the right to delay any alteration.
According to League, the historical community wanted to see these buildings become historically recognized.
“[Having the formal designation] tells the world, the city [and] the community, that we are recognizing these monuments,” League said.
VKC & Annenberg really?

Researchers at Keck School of Medicine have discovered a critical factor of viral cancer —causing component in the virus responsible for Kaposi’s sarcoma, the most prevalent type of cancer for HIV-infected individuals. 
The study was led by S.J. Gao, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Keck School of Medicine, in collaboration with colleagues at University of Texas at San Antonio and University of Texas Health Science Center.

Until recently, it was difficult to study the link between Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Kaposi’s sarcoma, because experimental cells that were infected with the virus died before they could become malignant cancer cells. Gao and his colleagues developed a new line of cells from rat stem models, which lived to become malignant cancer cells.
“I have been working in this area since the virus was discovered in 1994, and I was one of the earliest investigators and everybody has been working hard the last two decades because there were no models,” Gao said. “In 2012, we were able to develop a primary cell that had not been used before and we were able to demonstrate cancer using those cells.”
Gao continued to explain the particular characteristics of these cancer cells.
“There are [a] number of standard assays in the cancer field to test,” Gao said. “One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is the loss of contact inhibition. You can mimic this characteristic in vitro, where the cancer cells do not show contact inhibition, and when you put those cells in an animal, they become cancerous.”
Using these newly developed cells, the team identified the microRNA molecules that cause healthy cells to become cancerous. They showed that when these molecules were kept from functioning, the cells did not turn into cancer cells. When they were turned on the cells became cancerous.
Gao emphasized, however, that these microRNA molecules were just one of many factors that produce Kaposi’s sarcoma. Further work is necessary to identify the others.
“The microRNA is required for the process but is not sufficient by itself,” he said. “In cancer cells, there are many changes that need to happen [for healthy cells to become cancer cells]. What we have done is to identify one of those changes.”
This discovery comes as good news to individuals with compromised immune systems, as they are the most susceptible to Kaposi’s sarcoma. In areas with high HIV-infection rates, as much as 90 percent of the population shows signs of Kaposi’s sarcoma.
Gao highlighted the possible benefits of his discovery, but explained that it would take time for the discovery to be used in a drug.
“We know what is required for this cancer to occur, at least one of the them. From the therapeutic perspective, if you could, for example, inhibit the microRNA, you could theoretically stop the cancer,” he said. “This is a very early stage and we are doing basic work, so there is still a long way to go, but there is still that potential.”
Students appeared interested in the promising nature of this new discovery.
“Although this research isn’t complete, it is a promising development for combating KHSV and possibly cancer in general,” said Vance Lindolm, a junior majoring in computer science and business.
Rick Yang, a junior majoring public policy and development, echoed this statement.
“This research looks promising. I wonder how long it will take scientists to utilize this research into creating drugs or a vaccination to combat cancer.”
Jung-Gi Min, a junior majoring in biology and gerontology, thought the results of the study were interesting because of the virus’ unique system of infection.
“It makes a lot of sense that the virus would develop creative processes to enhance its survivability,” he said. “In this case, it is really interesting to see the virus using such a unique mechanism of host propagation through the utilization of miRNA.”

The University of Southern California was named one of the country’s most successful universities at graduating Latino students. 
According to an analysis completed by the Education Trust and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USC has increased its Latino graduation rate by 19 points to a rate comparable to that of Caucasian students.
USC is one of eight schools that the foundation uses as a model for graduating Latino students and is the only private institution listed in the report.
“Across the country, 51 percent of Hispanic students who start college complete a bachelor’s degree in six years, compared to 59 percent of white students,” the foundation said in a press release.
Senior art history major Alan Prieto said the university’s commitment to integrating minority students bolsters its reputation amongst the Latino community.
“I think USC puts a lot of emphasis on promoting diversity within the residence hall so students can learn from each other and I think they do it in a way that’s genuine and really efficient to help students be introduced to a learning environment in a metropolitan area,” he said.
In addition, Prieto said the school’s efforts to cater to students of specific races fosters a friendly and competitive environment on the campus.
“USC offers a lot of programs that are culturally and ethnically specific and I think that helps promote academics,” he said. “I think USC does a better job at being able to provide more opportunities to a wider ethnic pool and looking at applications and looking at the capabilities of each student to fill a quota for a certain demographic.”
Many low-income students such as freshman broadcast journalism major Mirian Fuentes come to USC because it provides myriad financial options. The university says more than two-thirds of its students receive financial aid, and Fuentes is on a full-tuition Trustee Scholarship.
The Neighborhood Academic Initiative helps prepare low-income students in grades 6 through 12 for college-level work and 41 percent of the program’s graduates thus far have attended USC on full academic scholarships.
“I think being a Latina here at USC is really empowering,” Fuentes said. “Especially in my culture, there’s not a lot of expectation to send people to main universities like USC. I feel like as a Latina I have a reputation to represent and make it known to other Latinos in high school that its possible to come here, but its not your race that gets you in as much as your determination.
Fuentes said organizations like Destino — a spiritual resource for Latino students — and the Hispanic Scholarship Fund have also help her find her place as a new student.
“Being part of Destino has made me really embrace being a Latina,” she said. “I had thought it was something about me I was going to have to change.”
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, expressed his hopes for Latino graduates in a press release.
“We want all our students to graduate with academic programs that prepare them to meet their personal aspirations,” he said. “Our success with Hispanic students can be attributed to a holistic approach that brings together faculty, academic advisors and student life professionals to promote engagement and success.”
This post has been updated to reflect that Gene Bickers is a male.

USC’s men’s basketball team is in the midst of a three-game losing streak and is looking to get back to its winning ways on Thursday as the Trojans (9-7, 0-3) travel to Salt Lake City, Utah to take on the Utah Utes.
The Trojans’ anemic offense might be particularly concerning to USC basketball fans — In the opening three games of conference play, the team has been outscored 259-186.
Drive · Junior guard Byron Wesley leads the Trojans wth 17.5 points per game, well above his 10.2 average from last year. Wesley will need to shoot well in order to defeat the dangerous 12-4 Utes.Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Head coach Andy Enfield addressed the offensive struggles that have plagued the Trojans through their first 16 contests, most notably during a 20-point loss at home to the top-ranked Arizona Wildcats on Sunday.
“We definitely turned the ball over too many times and had too many possessions where we didn’t score,” Enfield said. “Against a good team … you have to convert.”
The Trojans have dropped their first three contests in Pac-12 play, something that they had not done since the 2011-2012 campaign.
That year USC was able to stop their early season slide with a victory at home against the Utes (12-4, 1-3). Enfield’s squad will be hoping to imitate that feat this season on the Utes’ home court.
In the past few years, even when former star player O.J. Mayo led the team to the NCAA tournament, the Trojans have looked listless on the court. That does not seem to be a problem for this year’s squad, though.
“I’m very proud of our effort,” Enfield said after the Arizona contest.
A good deal of that effort is coming from sophomore forward Strahinja Gavrilovic.
The Serbia native was seeing only limited action early on in the season, but has seen his minutes increase recently. Against the Wildcats, Gavrilovic provided 10 points and four rebounds coming off the bench in 19 minutes of action.
“I just used my chance,” Gavrilovic said. “I tried to play aggressive, give it my best and try to help this team win.”
Another player who seems to be making the most of his chances is senior guard Pe’Shon Howard.
The former Oak Hill Academy star struggled coming out of the gate this season, but seems to have earned Enfield’s trust, and has become a steadying presence for the Trojans.
In the game against Arizona, Howard played the third-most minutes on the team (33), behind junior wing Byron Wesley and freshman guard Julian Jacobs, who has had an impressive first season at USC. With a very young squad surrounding him, Howard’s experience will be key in leading the team during the grueling Pac-12 schedule.
If the Trojans want to leave Utah with another win on their resume, Gavrilovic, Howard and the rest of the team will have to have a big day.
The Utes are 12-1 at home, with the only loss coming in a two-point nail-biter at the hands of the then 10th-ranked Oregon Ducks. Though they aren’t ranked in either the AP or the Coaches Poll, Utah is fourth nationally in field goal percentage at 51.3.
USC fans might feel like they are experiencing déjà vu with this basketball team, as USC has struggled out of the gate in each of the past three years.
This campaign, however, has seen USC drop seven games to teams with a combined 85-28 record through Jan. 13. Three of the losses were to teams in the top 25 (No. 1 Arizona, No. 6 Villanova and No. 25 UCLA), while six of the defeats were to teams in the top 68 of RPI standings, a metric taken into consideration when determining the 68-team field for the NCAA Tournament.
Following the game at Utah, the Trojans will continue their Pac-12 road trip by heading to Boulder, Colo. to take on the Colorado Buffaloes on Jan. 18. They will then return home to take on Stanford and California at the Galen Center.

Enough about football, eh?
Just kidding, football never sleeps at this school. Football is king. Period. The End. And rightfully so, seeing as it is responsible for funding all of USC’s other athletic programs.
But football season is a long eight-plus months away, and so I present to you my spring sports primer. This isn’t every program competing this semester — spring is a far busier time than fall in terms of athletics — but it should give you a nice idea of what you might want to check out instead of doing homework.
Men’s basketball is, in theory, the No. 2 program at this school. The Trojans got off to a promising 9-4 start this year under new coach Andy Enfield, including 7-0 at the Galen Center. But conference play has not been kind to this team, as they have lost their first three games in the Pac-12 to drop to 9-7. Granted, two of those losses have been to UCLA and Arizona — two of the best teams in the conference — but the season does not look promising for USC. As Sports Illustrated writer Pete Thamel tweeted during the Trojans’ 107-73 shellacking at the hands of UCLA, “USC has maybe 2 [sic] Pac-12 [caliber] players.” I don’t know if it’s quite that bad, but Thamel is not the only one to think along those lines. Stephen Rodrick wrote in a Men’s Journal piece on Enfield that “there are not five players on his roster he’d have recruited himself.”
Women’s basketball is likewise a rebuilding program for new coach and former USC standout Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. This squad will be more competitive than the men, as shown by its 4-1 record in Pac-12 play, including an upset of then-No. 12 Colorado. One big difference from years past for both the men’s and women’s teams: their games aren’t sleep-inducing anymore. Coaches Enfield and Cooper-Dyke both favor a fast-paced, up-tempo style of play. I remember two years ago the men’s team lost a game to Cal Poly (embarrassing) by a score of 42-36 (doubly embarrassing). I talked to then-coach Kevin O’Neill about that game a week later, and he said his team’s biggest problem that night was defense. You just can’t make this stuff up.
Women’s lacrosse will enter its second season of competition after a fairly respectable showing in its inaugural 2013 campaign. The game you don’t want to miss: April 20 against Stanford at the Coliseum, in case you’re looking for something to do that afternoon…
Defending NCAA champion women’s water polo will open the new Uytengsu Aquatics Center on March 7, and both the MPSF and NCAA Championships will be held there this spring as the Women of Troy look to defend their title.
Both men’s and women’s tennis will open the season in the nation’s top 5, and Marks Stadium is one of the underrated gems of campus (in no small part because they have the best free food, often in the truck variety). Both squads boast top-15 singles players in No. 10 senior Ray Sarmiento and No. 13 junior Sabrina Santamaria.
Men’s volleyball is looking to bounce back from a disappointing and downright shocking 2013 campaign, which saw them go 6-18 after opening the season ranked No. 8 in the country. Volleyball has grown on me in my time at USC; the Trojans’ loss to UC Irvine in the 2012 NCAA Championship at Galen Center remains to this day the single best non-football USC athletic event I’ve attended in my time here. This year is looking to be more promising as the Trojans have started 4-0, including a gritty five-set win over the aforementioned Anteaters of Irvine on Tuesday.
And then there’s baseball. I have covered almost every USC home baseball game the last three years, which has not exactly been a great time (68 wins, 99 losses in total) for the most successful program in the history of the sport. I could write several columns on baseball alone (and I will), but that is for when I have more space. The 2014 season is supposed to be different than the last few, and I don’t think that is a ridiculous claim. But it’s also not ridiculous to want to see it to believe it.
So there you have it, your spring sports primer. Now here are the really important dates to keep in mind: football recruit signing day is Feb. 5, spring football practice starts March 11, football Pro Day is March 12 and the annual spring game is April 19.
I’m sure that’s all you really needed to know.
 
“Any Given Saturday” still runs on Thursdays. To comment on this story, visit dailytrojan.com or email Nick at burtonn@usc.edu.
Nick, I think you’re asking too much of USC students.  Everyone knows that LA “fans” only support their teams when they are playing excellent, and even then it is only for social status.

After a disappointing season that culminated in a rough loss at the hands of UCLA, USC decided to fire head soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin. Khosroshahin made headlines in 2007 by becoming the first coach to ever win a national title in his or her debut season, but would never return to that high level in subsequent years. 
Athletic Director Pat Haden didn’t have to leave the Pac-12 for a replacement, hiring former Washington State coach Keidane McAlpine.
New goals · USC’s new women’s soccer head coach Keidane McAlpine hopes to return the program to national prominence.E.J. Deocampo | Daily Evergreen
In two seasons with the Cougars, McAlpine went 26-9-6 and guided the team to two NCAA tournament appearances. A graduate of Birmingham-Southern College,  the 39-year-old is considered a rising star in the college coaching ranks. Women’s soccer beat writer Andrew Schultz sat down with McAlpine yesterday to discuss the state of the program.
DT: Can you talk a little about your previous experience as a head coach?
McAlpine: I was just at Washington State for the last two years. Came in there from Auburn, where I was an assistant for the previous six. I got there to a relatively good team — the year before they were ranked fourth in the Pac-12 and got to the second round by winning in the first round against Kentucky in PKs. When I got there, my job was to keep them there and elevate them a little bit. I thought we did a good job with doing that transitioning in there. In the first year, we went 12-6-2, and made it to the first round where we lost in PKs to Portland. Last year, we had a history-making season, finishing second in the Pac-12 for the first time, went 14-3-4, but unfortunately we lost in PKs in the first round to Illinois. As much as we had a great season, we didn’t go quite as far as I wanted to.
DT: I know you’ve competed against USC as the Cougars’ coach. How familiar are you with the current roster, as well as any incoming recruits for next year’s class?
McAlpine: I know the current roster pretty well. Obviously, there are some players that I’d still like to get to know better. I recruited some of them, trying to get them to go to either Auburn or Washington State, so I’m familiar enough with the roster. The incoming [freshmen], I don’t know quite as well. I know a handful of those. As soon as we get the full staff in here, hopefully next week, we’re going to get out and make sure we get our eyes on that group as well. Either way, the previous staff did a pretty good job of recruiting. There’s a lot of talent on this roster, so I feel pretty comfortable about some of the things we’re going to be able to do with them.
DT: What made you decide to accept the USC coaching job after a couple successful seasons at Washington State?
McAlpine: Personally, it’s a good move for me. Soccer-wise, USC is a hotbed of talent in SoCal. The academic reputation is flawless. Most of the things alone were enough for me, but you look at the soccer program and its history, and [the] fact [that] it’s gotten a national championship. All of those things made it very appealing for me to come and try my hand at this school.
DT: Do you think your previous experience in the Pac-12 gives you an advantage coming to USC?
McAlpine: Yeah, going into Washington State I knew some of the schools, but having played against them for two years and coached against some of the coaches in the league, [who]are very, very good, it gave me a little more comfort coming in and starting with a new program. Knowing what the expectations are, knowing what we have to do to be successful and being able to immediately take a look at the roster and go, “OK, here are some things that we’re going to have to be prepared for in order to have the success that we want here.”
DT: I know it’s early, but as of right now, what are your plans and expectations for next season?
McAlpine: Here at USC, we expect to compete for championships. It’s that simple. Regardless of past history, regardless of what the perception may be of the program today, there’s a lot of talent on this roster … The expectation is to get better. The first step is to do well in the conference, position ourselves for the NCAA [tournament] and also really try to win a national championship again. It starts in the conference, and we just have to get better every day. If we do what we’re supposed to do, we should position ourselves to reach all our goals.

The USC men’s volleyball team is riding high this season after defeating UC Irvine to improve to 3-0 on the season. The Trojans are currently ranked No. 5 in the nation, and are set to move up in the rankings after their grueling 5-set victory over the No. 8 Anteaters, who won the national championship  the last two years in a row.
The Trojans will aim to remain undefeated tonight when they host the No. 3 Pepperdine Waves at the Galen Center. The Waves (2-0) are coming off two impressive wins against UC Irvine  and UC San Diego,  and are looking to avenge their loss to the Trojans from last season.
Good service · Junior setter Micah Christenson has tallied 147 assists in the Trojans’ three wins over Loyola-Chicago, UC San Diego and UC Irvine. Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
In last year’s match, the underdog Trojans, then ranked No. 15 nationally, upset the third-ranked Waves in four sets. Then-sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers led the way with 13 blocks, while then-sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera added 11. Both are looking to repeat their success against the Waves tonight, entering the match averaging two kills per set each.
Meanwhile, outside hitter Josh Taylor leads the Waves with 5.43 kills per set. Opposite/middle blocker Parker Kalmbach is the next-biggest contributor, with 4.29 kills per set.
Last August, Taylor competed with Team USA in the men’s Pan American Cup in Mexico City, where the U.S. team fell in the first round. USC’s junior setter Micah Christenson has also played at the national level, representing Team USA in the 2013 NORCECA Men’s Continental Championship in Langley, B.C., Canada. Christenson contributed 18 sets and two blocks in the championship match, in which Team USA defeated Canada.
With such competitive players on both teams, the match is sure to be enticing.
“Pepperdine is very much on the rise,” Christenson said. “We’re excited to get going against someone other than each other.”
Redshirt junior serving specialist Paul Yoder asserted that the team has prepared extensively to play against highly ranked teams such as the Anteaters and the Waves.
“We’ve been coming together really well as a team this year and that’s been a big focus of ours,” Yoder said. “[It’s] really just getting into the gym everyday and it’s not always about being perfect but it’s about growing each and every step of the way.”
The match will be held at the Galen Center at 7 p.m. It will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 Networks.
