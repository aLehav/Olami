On Feb. 4, 2014, the tech-world was abuzz with the news that industry giant Microsoft had crowned a new CEO, the third since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975. Satya Nadella, a relatively unknown 46-year-old American born and raised in Hyderabad, India, replaced Steve Ballmer to become the head of the world’s largest software maker, catapulting himself into the limelight he previously avoided. As an Indian-American myself, I was both intensely proud and deeply embarrassed that I had only just finished my first Java program which printed instructions for ordering Dominos.

Indians, along with the many other minorities unceremoniously dumped into the category “Asian or Asian-American” by census data, have long been viewed as a “model minority.” In fact, a 2009 Forbes article referring to us as just that, noted that, despite comprising less than one percent of the population, Indian-Americans accounted for 3 percent of US engineers, 7 percent of IT workers, and 8 percent of physicians and surgeons, and those numbers have only grown.
But what makes this group so extraordinarily successful, and why is it the marriage of Indian and American that seems to breed success?
The answer, I believe, is that while India, and many other Asian countries, currently lack the political stability and infrastructure of the US, the “hustler” mentality of immigrants combined with the entrepreneurialism embedded in American culture creates a unique group that thrives in our independent, meritocratic society.
In 2011, Yale professor and Chinese-American Amy Chua published The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, in which she attempted to prove that “Chinese” parenting was better than “Western” parenting. She and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, have released a new book, The Triple Package, about the success of different cultural groups in America.
“It turns out that for all their diversity, the strikingly successful groups in America today share three traits that, together propel success,” they wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times earlier this year. “The first is a superiority complex — a deep-seated belief in their exceptionality. The second appears to be the opposite — insecurity, a feeling that you or what you’ve done is not good enough. The third is impulse control.”
Taken separately these traits would achieve nothing, but combine them and you have the ultimate success package: someone continually striving for unattainable perfection. History has shown that there is no such thing as a super-race or a free lunch, this triple package is not inherited but learned and reinforced, but how?
To produce this paradox of a superiority complex and insecurity requires a delicate balance on the part of the parents. From my own experience and the experiences of my peers, I’ve concluded that this “triple package” is derived from three phenomena:
The first two create a superiority-inferiority-complex that has become characteristic of successful groups. Immigrant parents raised in countries that place extreme value on academic performance tend to be far more critical of their children than the holistic American education system itself is. Students both fail to meet their parents’ expectations while constantly exceeding their teachers’, creating a belief that they are simultaneously exceptional and not good enough.
The third point creates the trait of impulse control. Indian culture in particular places great value on the idea of duty and delayed gratification, combined with a deeply ingrained respect for all authority figures, especially teachers. The idea that children are representative of their parents and their family is also a large part of Indian as well as Chinese culture and places further pressure on the children to succeed.
Ultimately, the goal, Chua writes, is to create a “virtuous cycle” where parents push their kids to be successful until it becomes self-perpetuating. We naturally want to do what we are good at. so that we can earn praise and admiration, but to do so requires work that very few people have the natural inclination to do, and this, she argues, is where parents are needed.
As with anything, moderation is the key. The risk is great: too much pressure and you may create a self-loathing machine. Chua notes that many Asian Americans students earn the highest grades while reporting the lowest self-esteem. The reward: ask Satya Nadella.

Thanks for writing this article. This is the first of its kind that I’ve read and have not read that book from Chua you mentioned, but it makes a lot of sense. Both my wife and I are half Asian and half “White”. I’m half Korean half British-American and my wife is half Chinese half Polish-Ukranian American. Both our mothers are the Asian one in the household but it was the Asian mom (Korean) in my household that kept everything together – and for that reason, I know beyond a doubt that I am much more like my Korean mother than my father. Those three things you listed that are constantly in push-pull creating tension on each other are constantly oscillating toward achieving a balance. Apathy toward one section would create laziness. I see that apathy in my wife that is difficult to avoid resenting when I place such disdain for my “lack of greatness” while she finds comfort in any positive effort or outcome. From a relational perspective, I think if I married anyone else just like me, despite the fact that we’re both half Asian, I would probably find it very difficult to relate with that person – so I should not resent my wife because of this. She grew up in an appropriate male led household with an equally supportive Chinese mother. The key difference is that the “white” side dominated in matters of discipline i.e. standards of perfection and respect for authority and filial piety. Those are the two greatest values to me and the two greatest differences I see in our families. 
Thank you for writing this article. Hope what I responded with makes some sense.

A new weekend means new film releases, and you can look forward to a trio of nationwide releases this weekend. While they may not all to be quality films, there should be a new film for everyone. Each of these films touches on a different key demographic so everyone can enjoy a movie this weekend.
Vampire Academy, The Monuments Men and The Lego Movie are all releasing nationwide this weekend. In a month filled with mostly female-targeted films, this weekend has some of the only films that reach out to wider audiences.
The first of the new releases is Vampire Academy, the Mark Waters-directed film adapted from a series of young adult novels. It tells the story of a “Dhampir” (half-vampire half-human) girl and her adventures at a vampire boarding school after running away for two years.
The film comes off as a mix between Twilight and Harry Potter. While it does have all of the fantasy and plot elements that are akin to the renowned J.K. Rowling series, it also heavily focuses on romance and vampires, a staple in television and film as of late. It is the only new release this weekend targeting a female audience, and it will likely struggle to garner large crowds from the other demographics.
The Monuments Men, charged with a star-studded class led by George Clooney and Matt Damon, should win over large amounts of the audience. Much akin to Clooney’s Ocean’s Eleven films, this film should be both humorous and adventurous, while also stimulating an intellectual side because the premise focuses on rescuing valuable pieces of artwork during the closing stages of WWII. The film is based on a true story, but that won’t be the true catch for audiences. People love the the Damon-Clooney chemistry, and this film should be no exception.
The last major nationwide release for this weekend is The Lego Movie. The Lego Company has already won hits for its video game series, so it only made sense for the franchise to venture into film. This star-studded comedy, consisting of Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman and Will Arnett among others, won rave reviews from critics, especially noting on its animation. The film has been highly anticipated for a long time, and even though some people may find the concept gimmicky, it will still prove to be popular with a large percentage of audience members.
The key to this weekend’s box office is the target demographics. February films are typically targeted toward female audiences, so Vampire Academy suffers from being one in a bunch, not to mention that it specifically caters to adolescent females. While that is a relatively large demographic, it should not fare as well as the other two films this weekend, which cater to much larger audiences.
The Monuments Men is filled with A-list stars with a quality story behind it, and is one of the few films being released this month that caters to a male audience. The film should fare well over the weekend, with many people anticipating another film that features the duo of Matt Damon and George Clooney.
The Lego Movie should come on top in terms of new films.  An all-star cast coupled with a fresh concept and rave reviews means that this film should be near the top of the box office — not to mention that it also caters to audiences of all ages. Young kids especially will drag their parents to see the movie about toys. Look for this film to be the winner of the three.
The question still remains whether any of these films can top Ride Along, which has spent three weeks at No. 1. It made significantly less money last week, which may be attributed to the Super Bowl, but can also be a sign that it is time to step down from the top seat at the box office. Look for The Lego Movie to give No. 1 film a run for its money.

In light of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, I think it is appropriate to not only celebrate our athletes and all of their hard work, but to also celebrate what they eat.
Most athletes can consume just the types of food we usually try to avoid in excess: carbs and proteins. They have such high metabolisms due of their training that they can basically eat whatever they want, but one thing is for sure – carbs and proteins are two main food groups that are necessary for sustaining long lasting energy. For the rest of us, today we have an excuse to indulge – Happy National Fettuccine Alfredo Day!

What is fettuccini alfredo? Fettuccine Alfredo, though it was not American originally, has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants throughout the United States, like the Spaghetti Factory, Olive Garden and Louise’s Trattoria. The dish is essentially pasta with a parmesan, cream and butter sauce, that comes with a nice warm garlic roll and a side of Ceasar salad. If you live in the dorms, you know this dish as the white, peppery goop that you can choose to ladle on your al dente or completely smooshed noodles. Yum.
In Italy and throughout Europe, the name “fettuccine Alfredo” is basically unknown – leave it to Americans to make that so. In Rome it is usually called fettuccine al burro (pasta with butter). But a close cousin to the Alfredo is in Piedmont, one of the 20 regions in Italy, called “taglierini,” which is served with butter and truffles.
Fettuccini Alfredo hasn’t been around for all that long – it became popularized by Hollywood stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford when they honeymooned in Italy 1920.
For athletes, though, fettuccini Alfredo is not the healthiest of pastas. As a student-athlete at USC, my coach makes a point of making sure that dinner for my teammates and I must consist of pasta with red sauce, like spaghetti or pasta carbonara, or a protein like chicken.
Fettuccini is one of the fattiest of the pastas, because apart from the noodles, you have a load of heavy cream, butter, and a ton of parmesan cheese. Sure, the dish may be covering two main food groups in carbs and dairy, but as a well-rounded meal, not so much.
Think of it this way: Would you really want all that cream and butter to sit at your rump to create a cottage cheese effect or worse yet, form a nice tire-like shape around your waist? I’ll answer that for you: No, you wouldn’t, because Valentine’s Day and spring break are right around the corner.
But don’t let me crush your dreams of consuming something buttery and cheesy. In the words of Julia Child, “With enough butter, anything is good.”
It is always a good day to be an American with like fettuccini Alfredo, because it is customizable, and to some extent can be made “healthier.” Americans are known for being innovative, especially in the kitchen – just look at the amount of fusion food trucks and restaurants that surround our university. Fettuccini Alfredo can become a fusion by adding chicken, broccoli, peas or a combination of the three, though the cream and cheese always remain.
Of course you can always forego the cream altogether and just get fettuccine noodles mixed with a pleasant blend of virgin olive oil and some parmesan – one of my personal favorites, perfect for college students, to fill your stomach for a long night of studying or partying.
As the National Pasta Association advises, “Avoiding or limiting carbohydrates can leave you feeling sluggish, tired and unable to concentrate. Complex carbohydrates like pasta provides the optimum type of ‘fuel’ to power your muscles and brain, as it is digested more slowly, it provides a slower release of energy to keep you going throughout the day.”
Happy pasta eating!
