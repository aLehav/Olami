The university held a grand opening ceremony for the new Dr. Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall for Social Sciences on Wednesday. The $30 million, 98,000-square foot building first broke ground two years ago and opened for classes at the beginning of the semester.

The building houses several programs that aim to utilize multidisciplinary approaches for problem solving. Among the programs are the USC Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, the Center for Economic and Social Research, the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation and the USC Dornsife Mind and Society Center.
More than 500 people attended the ceremony, which was hosted in the open-air courtyard of the new building.
Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett began the ceremony by acknowledging some prominent attendees, including former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, USC Trustee Dr. Verna Dauterive and USC President C.L. Max Nikias and his wife Niki. Also in attendance were the deans of several USC schools and leaders from the construction and administrative teams.
President Nikias introduced Dauterive, who received her master’s and doctoral degrees in education from USC’s Rossier School of Education in 1949 and 1966, respectively, and commended her unprecedented contributions to the university.
“Today, we are celebrating one of education’s unique builders,” Nikias said. “Our USC Trustee Verna Dauterive breathes life into education. Her historic gift to this building was the largest by an African American in the history of American higher education.”
President Nikias also acknowledged Dauterive’s husband, the late Peter Dauterive. Dauterive’s $30 million donation in 2008 was in his memory. Peter Dauterive graduated near the top of his class from the Marshall School of Business and went on to become the founding president and CEO of Founders Savings & Loan Association.
“Peter never forgot his alma mater, supporting the Rossier School, Marshall School and the Norris Cancer Center,” Nikias said. “Peter and Verna shared a great commitment to each other but also to USC. Verna committed this building in memory of Peter. In many ways, Verna intended Dauterive Hall to be a love letter to her late husband.”
In her speech, Dauterive credited President Nikias and Provost Garrett for deciding the building’s Romanesque style and design, which was structured in a way to optimize collaborative spaces.
One of the building’s features is a sculpture titled “Ascending Thoughts” that changes color as the sun shines on it at different times of the day.
“I think it’s good to have a building that incorporates multiple levels of subjects,” said Ioan Trayanov, an undeclared junior. “Whether or not you have classes with these other people, you’re still going to see them and run into them. And they’re not just people in your major — it’s people who have different thoughts and leads to a new type of diversity.”
President Nikias hopes that the new building will help increase USC’s engagement with the world.
“Interdisciplinary research has been one of the strengths of USC,” Nikias said. “With this new beautiful building and what goes inside, it makes a big statement and brings all the research to the next level. It will really make it possible for different social science researchers and students to come together to do the work that hopefully benefits the city and the world.”

Finding a good Japanese restaurant in USC’s neighborhood has proven to be quite a difficult task, considering students typically end up venturing out to Downtown Los Angeles or other parts of the city when they crave sushi and sashimi. Fortunately, on South Union Avenue and Hoover Street, just a few minutes from campus, the recently opened Ebaes is sure to attract new customers.
Bariuma · Ebaes allows USC students and locals to enjoy quality food without venturing too far from their homes. Not to worry if you don’t like sushi ­— Ebaes has traditional ramen and meat dishes as well. – Photo courtesy of Facebook.com
Normally Japanese restaurants are expensive, but Ebaes takes the alternate route and provides its customers with reasonable portions of  food for an extremely manageable, cost effective price.
The decor and music of the restaurant are calming. In addition to the casual ambiance, it is reassuring to know that a fundamental priority of the restaurant is to cater to USC students and locals and provide them with a good experience.
Adding a bit of uniqueness to an otherwise  consistent atmosphere, the water glasses were Mason jars with handles, each with unique colors and different phrases and words, such as “Party Boy,” “Beast” and “Love Heals.”
The amusement doesn’t stop there. Surprisingly, the women’s restroom is full of  entertainment. The walls are covered with comics and images of the popular Japanese cartoon character Hello Kitty. Additionally the wallpaper features numerous photos of celebrity heartthrobs Channing Tatum and Zac Efron.
Owner Eric Bae takes pride in his attempt at distinctiveness,
“It is important to me that USC students feel welcome,” Bae said.
Ebaes was almost located among the student center eateries of UC Irvine, but on the drive home from Irvine, Bae was faced with traffic and decided to stop into USC favorite Bacaro LA. That was when he realized he could not pass up the “for sale” sign in the window between student hotspots Bacaro and Nature’s Brew, and he turned the building into what is now, the up-and-coming Ebaes.
The staff at Ebaes is both helpful and attentive; the service was prompt and each server was able to give valuable suggestions with regard to ordering.
The menu is easy to read and not overwhelming. The food options are efficiently labeled “vegetarian,” “spicy” or “signature” depending on the dish. Every dish brought to the table had superb presentation.
The Flaming Tuna roll, which has two spicy indicators on the menu, is the perfect choice if in the mood for a zesty adventure. Inside the roll is a fiery tuna and chili, and to top it off, the sushi comes with even more tuna, avocado and jalapeño slices. Interestingly, the menu also features a roll topped with peppery tuna and filled with crunchy potato chips. This culinary masterpiece is called the Idaho roll and is an Ebaes signature plate.
A Trojan roll also appears on the menu. The roll is a staff favorite and consists of an intense combination of cream cheese, avocado, tempura shrimp and crabmeat all topped with  spicy tuna. This roll is so big that it might even require two bites.
If sushi doesn’t sound appealing, don’t worry — Ebaes has a wide selection of non-sushi entree items as well. From a salad selection to several different forms of ramen, a few rice and noodle dishes and chicken-based items such as curry and Korean barbeque chicken wings, Ebaes covers all bases.
A signature dish called “The Original Ebaes Ramen” came to the table steaming, filling the air with a mouthwatering aroma. The kitchen provides a sizeable list of toppings for the ramen dishes, such as egg, chicken, chili paste, fried onions and green chilli butter.
Ebaes also has a secret menu, which includes zesty gyoza, veggie ramen and yellow curry.
To entice patrons, Ebaes provides customers with a complimentary Thai tea upon checking in to Ebaes on Yelp. This is a business focused on the customers and wants every customers experience  to be a priority.
Ebaes is exactly what USC needs. The food was delectable, and the atmosphere was enchanting and desirable. With its prime location and impressive offerings, Ebaes will become a USC favorite in a flash.
The official grand opening is on Friday, Sept. 5, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.

New domain · Daniel Negari and Shayan Rostam create a website domain that anyone can purchase starting at $9.99 a year. The .xyz ending provides customers with additional options for increased customization. – Photo courtesy of Daniel Negari and Shayan Rostam
 
This is the home of .xyz, a fresh new gTLD (generic top level domain) founded by Daniel Negari, a USC alumnus who graduated in 2008.  .xyz is in the business of selling website domains. Starting at $9.99 a year, customers can purchase a website domain with a .xyz ending, giving them more options for customization. Popular gTLD’s include .com, .info, .net and .org. Since officially launching on June 2, .xyz has garnered more than 450,000 registrations, including some in China. .xyz even has a celebrity client; NASCAR driver Kyle Busch uses .xyz as a URL shortener on his Twitter account.
.xyz is different from .com and the like because according to production manager Shayan Rostam, who is also a USC grad, says the value of .xyz lies in its memorability and ease of use. Currently, there are about 114 million registered domains with a .com ending and more than 270 million domains in existence across all domain extensions. Because most of the desirable domain names are already registered, a new domain extension can help a consumer find a more simple extension.
“Why would you pay more for a .com when you can get something that’s newer, fresher and memorable?” Rostam said. “It’s really been appealing to a younger demographic who didn’t necessarily grow up thinking about .com. It completely makes sense to them; they don’t even have to know about domain names to know that “xyz”  is the ending.”
Negari and Rostam mentions that on average, someone who uses GoDaddy.com, a popular website domain service, will search nine or 10 times before settling on a suitable domain name. Even then, many of the simple and memorable domain names are taken, making it necessary to incorporate combinations of symbols and numbers that can be confusing and long.
“We’re finding a lot of app developers and discovering that much of the next generation of internet users, the revolutionary people who are coming up with new ideas, [want] something shorter,” Rostam said. “When you give them the choice of a short ending like .xyz or one of those three word dot coms with a couple dashes, they’re going to choose .xyz every day.”
 
Rostam attributes much of the company’s success to the tight-knit team behind the scenes. Negari and Rostam, along with many of the staff at .xyz, were both members of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at USC and have remained friends since college. The close connections between the team members helped facilitate the company’s growth.
“We’ve been growing very quickly and we’re trying to hire Trojans and people we have a history with,” Rostam said. “And who we know will be loyal to the company and work hard and basically believe in our vision of making .xyz the next dot com.”
.xyz’s growth can be attributed to the hard work of the team.  “Much of our success has come from people who are behind the company and who work very well together and spend a lot of time together,” said Rostam.
Though he had the support of his fellow Trojans, Negari did not always set out to become a registry operator. While he was still a student at USC, Negari started a profitable real estate business. Needing somewhere to invest his profits.
“I was taking my profits and investing in domain names and it got to a point where I needed to form a company to hold my assets. That’s when I started Cyber2Media,” Negari said. I needed to do something with them, so I hired developers and programmers and designers who could take my ideas online and that’s how it all started.”
.xyz  was created three years ago when the organization that regulates the  internet, The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), allowed the privatization of top-level domain extensions.
“I was on the hunt waiting for ICANN to open up their application round and I always wanted .xyz,” Negari said. “I had bought XYZ.com throughout this process and I was planning on being a registrar when all of a sudden ICANN opened up the window to allow people to apply for new generic top-level domains.”
Abandoning his plans to become a website registrar like Go Daddy.com, Negari put in an application and a $185,000 non-refundable fee to acquire the .xyz domain extension. Negari later canceled his registrar and decided to go full force into the registree business. At age 28, Negari, CEO of .xyz and its parent company, Cyber2Media, is now ICANN’s youngest registry operator.
“In 2006, I met a guy who owned the .ws country code,” Negari said. “He was advertising it as a website and it kind of inspired me. I was on the hunt waiting for ICANN to open up their application round because I knew I always wanted .xyz.”
Though .xyz is enjoying rapid growth, none of it happened overnight. Negari advises aspiring entrepreneurs and businesspeople to gain as much experience as possible.
“Put yourself out there and work for free, Be an intern, Find the smartest people you can find and put yourself around them,” Negari said. “Be prepared to do what it takes, don’t complain and have fun. That’s really the mantra we have here. We’re all friends who work hard and play hard.”

After a successful opening weekend, the USC women’s volleyball team is heading to their second straight road tournament, the Commonwealth Classic in Lexington, Kentucky. The No. 6 Women of Troy will face two tough foes on their weekend trip: Creighton and No. 16 Kentucky.
Block trial · Junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms helped lead USC to a school-record 21 blocks in their win over Pacific last Saturday. Ogoms started 27 matches as a freshman before missing most of last season due to injury. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The squad opened up its season last weekend at the Community Bankers Volleyball Classic in Stockton, California. There the Women of Troy faced unranked opponents Rider, Arkansas-Little Rock and host Pacific. In their first two matches against Rider and Arkansas-Little Rock, the Women of Troy made quick work of their foes, winning in three and four sets, respectively.
USC’s final match against host Pacific was a grudge match of sorts for head coach Mick Haley. The Women of Troy had struggled against the Tigers in the past, with an 8-10 all-time record. With a very rowdy and intense crowd, the Trojans pulled out a victory in a five-set thriller to bring their record to 3-0 on the season.
Haley  admitted that the Pacific crowd caused his team some trouble.
“Pacific kept us from scoring and they played really scrappy defense,” Haley said. “They also served us smart in a couple of rotations and they had a powerful left hander that lit us up for a bit.”
After the tournament, it was announced that junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio was named Most Valuable Player. Bricio had 31 kills and 28 digs in only 12 games played over the three matches.  During the Pacific match, Bricio moved into third place in school history with 142 aces, passing USC great Alex Jupiter.
Haley praised Bricio’s performance over the course of the tournament.
“Sam has improved a bunch on her passing,” Haley said. “Once she gets consistent with her shorter arm swing, watch out, she’ll be tough to stop.”
Also recognized were freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis and junior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, both of whom joined Bricio on the All-Tournament team. Ogoms helped the team match a 10-year-old single-game mark with 21 total blocks against Pacific.
Without sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu, who missed the tournament due to an undisclosed injury, the Women of Troy’s attack had to rely mainly on Bricio and Gillis.
In the first game against Rider, Gillis shined with 11 kills on only 14 swings, giving her a .714 hitting percentage. Though she had great hitting success, the New Castle, Indiana native felt that her passing and defense were most important to the team’s success.
“I love playing defense,” Gillis said. “I like making the momentum plays, like a big block or a great defensive play.”
Gillis also averaged three digs per set the entire tournament.
This coming weekend, the Women of Troy will face off against the 16th ranked Wildcats on Friday before taking on Creighton and Northern Iowa the next day. The Bluejays, though currently unranked, are a perennial contender who came into the season ranked 23rd. This tournament will be yet another early test for this young team.
Going into Lexington, USC is ranked sixth according to the American Volleyball Coaches Association poll and the NCAA top-25, and are looking to improve upon those rankings with a win against Kentucky. This game figures to be a tough test, especially considering the Wildcats’ multiple schemes.
Senior Hannah Schraer knows that the hosts will be a tough team to beat.
“They are bigger than the teams last weekend,” Schraer said. “They are very athletic and they have a very strong defense, especially in serve-receive.”
The Trojans will get a huge boost this weekend from Nwanebu, who will see her first action with the team after a record-setting freshman season. The Lucas, Texas native was 2013’s AVCA National Freshman of the Year.
Nwanebu’s return will give the Women of Troy a one-two punch with Bricio and Nwanebu hitting up front. Gillis will also continue to mix into the lineup.
In the back row, there will still be an open competition for the libero position. Sophomores Anne Marie Schmidt and Taylor Whittingham both saw action during the Bankers Classic.
This weekend will be a homecoming of sorts for Gillis, whose family home is not far from Kentucky.
“My family is going to be there,” Gillis said. “Maybe even my whole town.”
The Women of Troy will look to come home with an undefeated 6-0 record going into their first home tournament, the USC Classic.

No one can deny that USC has earned its reputation as a running back factory. “Tailback U,” as our school is historically known, has produced five Heisman trophy winners at the position — four, if NCAA president Mark Emmert is reading this over your shoulder — along with many other NFL backs. Marcus Allen and O.J. Simpson, whose trophies still rest in Heritage Hall, went on to become two of the greatest NFL running backs of all-time. As recently as 2005, when R—-e B–h and his backfield mate LenDale White terrorized the college football world, this tradition was alive and well. Since then, however, things have changed.
The last decade of Trojan football has by no means been free of capable tailbacks. This year’s main ground threat, redshirt junior Javorius “Buck” Allen, certainly looks like he could join former Trojan and current Washington Redskin Silas Redd in the NFL soon. But even Allen and Redd have been exceptions to the norm in the post-B–h era, the top two names among a laundry list of highly touted, injury-prone, scandal-ridden and ultimately disappointing tailbacks.
Stafon Johnson and Emmanuel Moody were the all-world recruits expected to replace the two-headed monster of B–h and White, realistically an impossible job. A year later Moody had transferred and Johnson had been replaced by yet another freshman, C.J. Gable. Gable struggled before eventually being replaced by Marc Tyler, who was replaced by Curtis McNeal, and on the story goes.
Why Allen and Redd — along with McNeal at times — have been the only memorable starting tailbacks over the last 10 years of Trojan football is an interesting question. Clearly the sanctions stemming from the misdeeds of the last truly great USC back (curse anyone?) have not helped. Fewer scholarships create a smaller squad, shrinking the pool of capable players and multiplying practice and game reps for starters and backups. At a punishing position like running back, this can be a major problem. Redd and current redshirt junior Tre Madden, who both logged significant injury time during their careers, can attest to that. Still, another trend intrigues me even more. As USC has failed to live up to its historical title of “Tailback U” in the last decade, it has arguably gained another one: “Wide Receiver U.”
Along with a truly remarkable stable of running backs, Trojan fans have always been able to look back at a memorable group of wideouts. Lynn Swann and Keyshawn Johnson both went on to All-Pro and Super Bowl-winning NFL careers. Often regarded as the best USC receiver of all-time, Dwayne Jarrett set just about every school and conference record that existed before his own pro career was cut short by off-the-field issues. But, at least until the last decade, these guys were few and far between. After Swann’s departure, twenty years came and went before Johnson stepped on the scene. Yet another decade separated Johnson and Jarrett. Now, however, it seems that Trojan fans can’t even go a single year without witnessing a potential NFL great suiting up at receiver.
It all started with Robert Woods. The current Buffalo Bills standout teamed up with Matt Barkley to make 2011 one of the most exciting seasons in USC history, recording nearly 1,300 yards and setting a school record with 15 touchdowns.
Playing second fiddle to Woods that season was a freshman named Marqise Lee, who followed up a 1,143-yard debut campaign with the greatest season by a wideout in school history. Lee led the nation with 118 receptions in 2012, racking up a preposterous 1,721 yards and setting USC records in both categories. In a road loss to Arizona, Lee did his best to keep the Trojans’ national title hopes alive by himself with a positively insane 345 receiving yards. That number is, you guessed it, a school record. The only record Lee couldn’t break that season, it seemed, was the touchdown mark set by his teammate Woods the year before. Lee would struggle with a knee injury in 2013, a loss that would force most programs to completely revamp their offense. Not USC, however, as the team had yet another spectacular pass-catcher waiting in the wings.
Though he suffered through Lane Kiffin’s disturbingly conservative play-calling and the growing pains of a first-year quarterback last year, junior Nelson Agholor has been one of “Wide Receiver U’s” better students. Agholor picked up 918 receiving yards and eight total touchdowns in 2013, numbers made more impressive when you realize Lee was still on the team. This year, Agholor officially takes the mantle as the Trojans’ No. 1 receiver, and is primed for a breakout year with seasoned redshirt junior Cody Kessler at quarterback.
Even the question of Agholor’s eventual replacement, a scary one through the spring and summer, has seemingly been answered. True freshmen Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith looked every bit the college-ready two-way players they had been advertised to be in Saturday’s pantsing of Fresno State. If the pair continues to impress, their offensive reps will only go up.
As the transition from “Tailback U” to “Wide Receiver U” has become more apparent, the question of what exactly started the trend should be considered. College football teams are passing more across the board, to be sure, but until this season USC had resisted the up-tempo, pass-happy offense that has inspired that change. As much as we all hate to say it, the transition from Pete Carroll to Lane Kiffin at head coach could be part of the answer; all of these players reached their primes under Kiffin. You could even say blind luck played a role: Jackson, Lee and Woods all happened to attend the same high school, just down the street at USC-pipeline Junipero Serra in Gardena, California.
Whatever the real reason, I’m not too concerned. All I know is that I’ll be watching this bunch catch passes on Saturdays — and Sundays — for a very long time.

Ahead of their home opener this Friday, the USC women’s soccer team boasts an already remarkable resume.
Having played only four non-conference tournament games away from McAllister Field to this point, the Women of Troy have yet to taste defeat and will be vying for their third straight win under the new regime of first-year coach Keidane McAlpine.
Equalizer · Sophomore midfielder Savannah Levin picked up her first career goal last Saturday to tie Notre Dame at 1. USC went on to win 2-1. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
Their opening tournament in San Diego resulted in a 1-0 win over Long Beach State, followed by a hard-fought overtime draw against tournament host team USD.
But it was their results this past weekend that propelled the squad to adopt an even hungrier mentality.
At the Notre Dame adidas Invitational in South Bend, Indiana this past weekend, the Women of Troy handily beat Iowa State — an up-and-coming program — with a final score of 3-1 on Friday.
They then rode that momentum into their Sunday match against the host Notre Dame — ranked No. 11 in the country heading into the match — and came back from a 1-0 deficit to upset the Irish 2-1, in stunning fashion.
As the new coaches poll was released this week, the previously unranked Women of Troy now found themselves inside the top-25.The team vaulted to No. 19, due mostly to their undefeated record and weekend performance.
Head coach McAlpine’s focus remains, however, on the more important bigger picture.
“It’s flattering,” McAlpine said, “But at the same time our goal is really simple. Let’s continue to be better than we were, let’s continue to get our details right. If we can do those, then the rest will take care of itself.”
Sophomore midfielder Savannah Levin, who scored her first career goal to tie up Sunday’s game, echoed that same message.
“I think that a huge thing is not getting complacent with the fact that we beat a No. 9 team,” she said. “I think if we continue that energy that we came out with in the second half of that game, it’ll be good.”
Their continuing slate of non-conference games will be an opportunity to keep improving, as their home opener will force them to remain focused and not to look past another team who has yet to lose this season in UC Riverside.
“Riverside, we know they’re tough, we played them in the spring and we know what they bring. They’re going to be a team that’s going to test us,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine’s defense may be faced with the biggest test of them all.
The UC Riverside Lady Highlanders are also undefeated so far, and in the process have scored nine goals in three matches; an incredibly effective offensive attack that Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week Reilly Parker and Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week Caroline Stanley will have to deal with on Friday.
Parker, a junior transfer from North Carolina, scored two goals over the weekend, including the game-winner against Notre Dame.
Her presence in the lineup as an outside defensive back has been essential in Coach McAlpine’s 4-3-3 formation and has led to a balanced attack from the wings without sacrificing their important defensive formation.
Parker, who has transitioned seamlessly from her tenure at Chapel Hill, credits the coaching staff for such a strong start.
“They just really instilled this belief and confidence amongst us that none of us believed that we had,” she remarked. “They believe in us more than we believe in ourselves and that makes all the difference.”
Having a great veteran goalkeeper in the net also helps, and senior Caroline Stanley is that and much more.
Stanley is one of the few veterans and unquestioned leaders of this young team and will now look to continue her consistent goalkeeping of allowing no more than one goal in any game so far against the potent Lady Highlanders.
Friday’s game is an early non-conference match, but with momentum on their side, and a home crowd finally behind them, this result may be more important than the previous four.
“We can’t wait to get out here in front of our hometown fans to put on a show for them and show them the Trojans are back and that this is our year,” Parker said.
Not only will the Women of Troy attempt to keep their undefeated streak going, but also in ending UCR’s streak, they hope to give their home fans a taste of what the crowds in San Diego and South Bend experienced.
“It’s going to be a great home opener and we encourage everyone to come out and see it.”

Following USC’s 52-13 win over Fresno State in their season opener, the No. 14 Trojans are preparing to take on No. 13 Stanford in Palo Alto, California this Saturday.
Sigh of relief · All-American defensive end Leonard Williams rolled his ankle during Tuesday’s practice, but will play against Stanford this weekend. Williams had seven total tackles and an interception against Fresno State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Ready, Set, Go!
All eyes were on USC’s two injured captains at Wednesday’s practice.
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler fully participated in practice after sitting out the day before with a toe injury, but junior defensive end Leonard Williams was unable to practice and wore a tie-up ankle brace after rolling his ankle on Tuesday.
When asked about his two leaders, head coach Steve Sarkisian said that both players are “ready to go” and assured all that they would both be able to play on Saturday.
Fighting Speed with Speed
A lot of the attention this weekend will be on the explosive offense of Stanford, who beat UC Davis 45-0 last weekend, and how USC will react after running a Pac-12 record 105 plays during its rout of Fresno State.
When asked about fighting fire with fire, freshman wide receiver-cornerback Adoree’ Jackson emphasized the mindset it takes.
“It’s about doing the little things: playing smart, staying focused and not getting any dumb penalties,” Jackson said.
As one of the fastest players on the team, Jackson is again expected to see playing time on both sides of the ball.
“The speed that [Jackson] has matches up well defensively for us because he can really run,” Sarkisian said. “Offensively he’ll have a package for us as well.”
Amid all of the focus on the speed of the two teams, Sarkisian stressed the fundamentals of defense and converting third downs.
“You want to commit to defending the run, but then you know they can beat you with the deep ball to create explosive plays, which they were able to do last week,” Sarkisian said. “Efficiency on third downs is going to be something to watch closely because both of us want to extend drives and the best way to do that is converting on third down.”
Just Another Game
After a successful home opener to start off the year, the Trojans face a much different atmosphere as they head up the road for the first big test as a team aspiring to win the Pac-12 South.
Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens did not seem too concerned with all the chatter around the elite matchup.
“We can’t make the game bigger than what it is,” Cravens said. “It’s only week two. We’re going to approach it like we approach every game.”
Cravens knows all about making an impact against Stanford, as he had a key interception late in last year’s 20-17 win against the Cardinal.
Sarkisian hopes to see Cravens utilize his unique skillset again this year.
“Su’a’s versatility is a real key for us in this game because he can play down in the box and be physical, and then he can be a deep safety in some of our nickel sets and everything in between,” Sarkisian said.
Beat the Farm
When the word rivalry is heard, most at USC will immediately think of a school in Westwood, California or one in South Bend, Indiana. But the rivalry with Stanford has become one of the most exciting matchups for the Trojans year in and year out.
Coming off a year where unranked USC knocked off 5th-ranked Stanford, the two teams enter Saturday side-by-side in the latest AP poll — Stanford sits at No. 13 while USC is No. 14.
Senior linebacker Hayes Pullard compared Saturday’s game to a test, saying the preparation done on the practice field has prepared the team for this Saturday’s matchup and that the team is itching to play.

For Ukraine, 2014 has been a year marked by escalating conflict and tension. Protests for governmental change, the dissolution of Parliament, Russian annexation of Crimea and trouble at the Russian border have strained the Ukrainian people. Given the reemerging Cold War tensions and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive actions, the time has come for the Obama administration to step up its policy and demand that Ukrainian autonomy be respected and that Russian attempts to annex cease.
The annexation of Crimea last March by Putin was an egregious violation of international law with regard to Ukrainian autonomy. The presence of Russian troops at the eastern border of Ukraine should be dismissed, and the propping up of pro-Russian rebels in the area should not be tolerated. The Obama administration’s policy of sending diplomatic messages to Russia has failed. If the United States continues to make no tangible efforts, Russia and the global community will cease to respect U.S. strategy.
Obama needs to aid Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and negotiate with Russia for an end to border invasion and military influence in eastern Ukraine. In addition, the Ukrainian government needs to stand up for its own autonomy. It needs to temper the demands of pro-Russian rebels and foster an inclusive environment that allows for the democratic recognition of all factions and parties involved.
The lack of action by Obama in Ukraine is a microcosm of the administration’s foreign policy as a whole. The hands-off, laissez-faire approach during the Arab Spring has translated to a similar employment of diplomatic efforts in Eastern Europe. The situation in Ukraine, however, is fundamentally different. That is to say, though Ukrainians rose up to demand change, the actions of Russia and the events in Crimea have altered the dynamic and shifted the stasis of conflict toward Russian aggression rather than civil unrest. Russia has violated international norms and has, in a sense, implemented Cold War tactics to reach its goals of expansion and annexation. The United States should not tolerate these sorts of strategies if it seeks to prevent further aggression from Russia.
“Russian aggression” is an umbrella term to describe the events happening in eastern Ukraine. It largely translates to actions devised and orchestrated by Putin, who resembles the belligerent, expansionist and power-hungry leaders of the 20th century. The lack of negotiations by the Obama administration allows Putin to further his goals. America needs to exert its influence and make it clear that human rights, autonomy and territorial rights must be recognized and respected.
As the events in Ukraine continue to develop, the Obama administration must employ an influential philosophy and potent action to protect the Ukrainian people, then normalize threats of action against other eastern European countries and temper the ambitions and expansion of Putin and Russian troops. It is time for President Obama and his administration to step up to the plate.
 
Athanasius Georgy is a sophomore majoring in biological sciences. His column, “On the World Stage,” runs Thursdays.
 
What exactly can Obama do more than he has done? The treasury is empty. The people are overtaxed and war weary. Obama has used every tactic that is left him. It is time to let other countries do their business and try to stay neutral in their wars until such time as we have redeemed our creditor status from our current status of debtor..

The United States, a country with a rich immigrant tradition, is currently experiencing an identity crisis. Tens of thousands of migrant children from Central America have been apprehended while attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico since January, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Elizabeth Cutbirth | Daily Trojan
Many of these children are fleeing their home countries unaccompanied due to persistent drug and gang violence or sexual abuse, and they are in search for a better life in the United States. Some are also in search of family or friends already living in the States. In early June, President Obama called the issue an “urgent humanitarian situation.” In July, he began seeking billions of dollars in aid to deal with the crisis.
Since then, the president has been mum on the issue along with most politicians who aren’t gearing up for mid-term elections. This stance needs to change immediately if those in Washington want to have any credibility with the nearly 28.2 million Hispanics who will be eligible to vote in 2016. This group is also an increasingly important voting bloc in swing states such as Florida, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Part of the president’s solution involves utilizing the funds to create a multi-agency federal task force, which would be overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This is the same government-run organization that botched the Hurricane Katrina response effort in 2005. The Obama administration is also considering executive authority to quickly deport the children back to their respective countries, a seemingly quick fix to the problem.
Though creating a task force is a good start, the federal government must also engage Central American leaders regarding lax child protection laws that have allowed these children to leave home in the first place.
Violent gang-related crime in the areas of Central America that these children are coming from continues to rise. The New York Times reported that in El Salvador, there are 77 percent more murders of children ages 17 and under than a year ago. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the city in Central America with the most migrant children arriving in the United States — more than 2,200 between January and May — was San Pedro Sula in Honduras. This same city is home to the world’s highest homicide rate.
The United States needs to stem the heavy violence among children in these cities by sending in National Guard troops to build a peace-keeping effort and help to restore trust in local politics and police forces, which has fizzled as of late.
The United States has been put in an especially difficult position given the fact that the country needs to balance its outdated illegal immigration policies with the fact that children aged 5 to 17 are willing to risk their lives to leave their homes for a better life.
The media has shed negative light on the response from communities and towns that are being directly impacted by migrant children and the need to house them. In July, protestors in Murrieta, California even went so far as to create a human blockade and stop three busloads of children who were headed to an immigration Border Patrol station for processing.
In a desperate effort to pick up last-minute voter support ahead of his primary, Arizona Speaker of the House Andy Tobin voiced his concerns on the undocumented children from Central America and their ability to infect Americans with Ebola. No case of the Ebola outbreak has been reported to originate outside of Africa.
This type of behavior is not what this country was founded on. The president and local agencies do, however, have to deal with setbacks. The average time for a case in immigration court is roughly 280 days, according to a 2010 Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) report.
One solution would be to separate each case on a country-by-country basis. This would involve appointing court specialists along with pro-bono or private practice attorneys with country-specific backgrounds to help deal with the backlog. Each specialist would be assigned a set number of cases to handle and must have some knowledge and work experience with the country they are chosen to work with.
Progress on the educational front is key as well. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a total of 37,477 children have been released to an adult sponsor, often a family member. With summer winding down, these children are eligible to begin public school in a few short weeks due to federal law stipulating that educational agencies are required to provide uniform access to public education regardless of immigration status. Only time will tell how they are received in this respect.
The quote by American Poet Emma Lazarus at the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York City says it best: “Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
Political leaders in Washington need to follow Lazarus’ words closely in making a positive impact in the lives of these children by giving them proper due process for each case, a precedent that will set an example for other countries to follow.
 
 
 
 
 
No thankfully every major city in the USA isn’t experiencing drug wars, gang violence and/or police brutality…..Also, for any issues in those cities we rely on the state and local governments for policy changes/updates etc 99% of the time. 
You can’t compare Syria and Libya with any country in Latin America, that’s like comparing apples to oranges mi amigo. Plus the voting bloc of hispanics in this country (USA) is too large for any official to ignore.
Is not every major city in the USA also experiencing drug wars, gang violence and police brutality. Why should these children be treated any different from the people already here? There are clear policy changes that could alleviate the the problems, yet politicians and voters like the status quo. President Obama already orders killings overseas, missile strikes, grants of weapons and the like. Why not use those same tactics to solve this humanitarian crisis? Why should he use one set of tactics in Syria and Libya and another when it is Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador?
