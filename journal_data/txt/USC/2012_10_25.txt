“I was 16 when he stole from me. Stole my virginity, my dignity and my self-esteem. I want it back!”
This short but powerful saying is written on a life-size black silhouette cutout of a person in the lobby of the Arts & Humanities Residential College at Parkside.

But this cutout is not alone. Along with many other silhouettes around campus, this simple shape helps represent Domestic Violence Awareness Week, a weeklong series of programs sponsored by the Center for Women and Men that ends Friday.
Sheetal Chib, the center’s program coordinator,  said the center felt it would be beneficial to “educate and bring awareness [of domestic violence] to the USC community.”
Though a national Domestic Violence Month has existed since 1987, the Domestic Violence Awareness Week at USC is only in its fourth year.
Still, over four years, more than just the programming during the week has changed. The biggest transformation, according to Chib, has taken place in student involvement.
She said that in the first year the program existed, the center was the force behind the events, but now there are student organizations wishing to co-sponsor events.
On Wednesday, the Latina-oriented sorority Omega Phi Beta co-sponsored the “Purple Ribbon Campaign.”
Supporters of the campaign, including members of Omega Phi Beta, handed out purple ribbons, which represent domestic violence awareness.
Omega Phi Beta’s part coincides with its national philanthropy: Raising Awareness of Violence Against Women.
Since Oct. 17, the sorority has also hosted a Facebook group called “These Hands Don’t Hurt,” which encourages students to post pictures of their hands with positive messages raising awareness against domestic violence, Omega Phi Beta President Nancy Talamantes said.
“This is our sorority’s cause,” Talamantes said. “And it’s a cause I personally hold close to my heart.”
According to Chib, handing out ribbons and spreading awareness on campus are ways members of the USC community can “show their support for survivors as an ally, friend or family member.”
Another sorority participating heavily in the week, Alpha Chi Omega, organized and held a candlelight vigil Thursday night.
The ceremony, which Chib said is one of the biggest events during the week, presents speakers from all different fields who have connections to domestic violence.
Alpha Chi Omega’s philanthropy is Domestic Violence Awareness which, according to Vice President of Philanthropy Christina Welch, directly ties into the sorority’s involvement in Domestic Violence Awareness week.
According to Welch, the money is raised for the Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women and Children — a center dedicated to helping women and their children who have been victims of domestic abuse better their lives.
The sorority is also involved with Linda’s Voice, a program developed to stop domestic abuse. Created by three girls whose mother was murdered by their step father, the group’s mission is to help women find the strength to leave abusive relationships and lead productive and fulfilling lives.
At the vigil, a speaker from the Good Shepherd Center talked about the shelter and representatives of Linda’s Voice talked about their story and how it is used to empower people.
Though they’ve been planning the event since September, Alpha Chi Omega’s dedication to spreading awareness of domestic violence has gone on much longer. According to Welch, domestic violence “may not be talked about as much as other issues.”
Welch said Alpha Chi Omega’s goal is to inform students about on-campus resources for victims of domestic violence, a sentiment that Chib agrees with.
“We’re highlighting to the greater community that it’s an issue we feel is important and needs to be stopped from happening in our community,” Chib said.
Other members of the sorority said that though they were previously unaware of the extent of domestic violence, their philanthropy has helped them learn how important it is to prevent.
“Every year we have speakers come to our candlelight vigil because people don’t know how domestic violence can affect people. Sometimes it is physical, sometimes it is verbal,” said Shea Horn, a senior majoring in business administration. “It helps people to know what to do if they or one of their friends is experiencing abuse.”
For Chib, the biggest value of this program is seeing the response from victims of domestic violence.
“Often [domestic violence victims] feel ashamed and isolated and alone in their experience and unable to seek out help,” she said. “This brings broader awareness in the community and makes survivors feel not alone.”
According to Todd Henneman, the assistant director of the Center for Women and Men, this program is part of a national initiative to remember those injured or killed in acts of domestic violence.
In fact, Henneman said that’s what the silhouettes, featuring personal stories contributed anonymously by survivors of domestic violence, statistics about domestic violence or quotations by famous Americans denouncing domestic violence, are meant to represent.
“We know that our Trojan Family includes survivors of domestic violence, and we hope that these silhouettes provide a gentle reminder to them that they are not alone,” Henneman said.
An additional aspect of this program is helping people have a “fun and safe and healthy experience here during their time as students,” Chib said.
But the domestic violence awareness campaign does not end this week for the Center of Women and Men. In April, the organization will sponsor the Clothesline Project, which will display T-shirts in Alumni Park to memorialize survivors of domestic violence.
Omega Phi Beta also has a weeklong event in March to raise awareness of violence against women.
Good article, but please reorganize the title wording, as it is misleading: “Program aims to spread awareness of domestic violence on campus” implies, from the placement of the last modifier, that this program deals specifically with domestic violence occurring on campus, e.g. between students.
Better would be: “On-campus program aims to spread awareness of domestic violence” or some variant.

With 11 statewide initiatives on the November ballot, some student voters remain divided about the less publicized measures, like Proposition 32.
Prop. 32 would ban all political contributions to candidates from corporations and unions, as well as the ban of automatic wage deduction from employees’ paychecks for political donations. If this proposition passes, corporations and unions will no longer be able to use the money deducted from employees’ paychecks for political purposes.
According to a poll conducted by the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times released Thursday, 39 percent of respondents said they supported Prop. 32, while 46 percent said they opposed it.
Supporters argue a yes on Prop. 32 goes as far as the U.S. Constitution allows to cut the monetary tie between special interests and politicians. The Yes on Prop. 32 campaign cites corruption as the main reason for the initiative.
On their website, the campaign states: “Special interests control Sacramento … corporations, business associations and unions gave $89 million to state politicians and campaigns for the 2010 elections alone.” By contrast, opponents of the bill argue that it would, in fact, infringe on citizens’ rights to donate to a particular candidate or election.
“Prop 32 supporters claim the law will limit big campaign spending from all sides,” according to the Vote No on 32 website. “But the reality is that it would restrict everyday Californians from coming together to have a voice in elections while creating massive special exemptions for the same groups funding the campaign.”
Speaking as a non-partisan entity, the Legislative Analyst’s Office released a report detailing the measure and the effects it would have if passed. In the report, the office stated that the primary fiscal cost of the measure would be in the enforcement of these donations and the regulation of fair political practices.
“The amount of these costs is unknown, but could be in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars annually,” the Legislative Analyst’s Office stated in the same report. “Some of these costs could be offset by increased fines for not complying with the measure’s provisions.”
Like the respondents in the USC Dornsife poll, other USC students also seemed divided over the pros and cons of the measure.
“I agree with it because I feel that it is the individual’s right as to how they would want to lobby their money,” said Nicole Jabson, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning. “That should be up to the individual’s discretion and should not be up to corporations or unions.”
Andy Tran, a first-year law student, also agreed with banning political contributions by deductions.
“If employers take wages from employees and put it wherever they want, I would be against that,” Tran said. “If they made the deductions mandatory and let the workers choose where the money was going, that would be a different story. The fact that [workers] are getting their money taken away and not being able to choose where that money goes is bothering.”
While supporters claim it will take big money out of politics, those against Prop. 32 argue that it will unfairly bar contributions by unions since it would still allow super PACs to contribute. They believe that the measure is largely supported by big businesses that will not be subject to its restrictions.
“I’m against Prop. 32 because it is unfairly biased against unions,” said Matthew Ivan, an undeclared sophomore. “It targets unions, who are very much representative of the middle class.”
Jabson also emphasized that there is too much at stake on this proposition for hard-line party bias to affect one’s vote.
“People need to be more educated on it because there is currently a lot of bias among liberals and conservatives, when it should really depend on your idea of how far corporations and unions should go in contributing to campaigns,” Jabson said.

Support for Propositions 30 and Proposition 37 is falling among California voters, according to a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll released Thursday.
Only 46 percent of respondents said they were in favor of Prop. 30, Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax initiative, marking the first time support has fallen below the 50 percent margin. Prop. 37, which would require foods containing genetically modified ingredients to be labeled, dropped to garnering 44 percent support from California voters.
Prop. 30, which would raise revenue for public education and public safety by temporarily increasing the state sales tax by one-quarter cent and raising personal income taxes on citizens who earn more than $250,000 a year, has continually declined in the polls from a level of 61 percent support in March. Experts, such as Dan Schnur, the director of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, attributed this decrease in support to the public perception of the state government.
“Governor Brown has successfully convinced voters that more spending on the state’s public schools is a good thing,” Schnur said. “What he has yet to do is convince them that state government can be trusted to spend their tax dollars wisely.”
Additionally, Drew Lieberman of the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, which helped conduct the poll, said that though voters want to protect education, they do not have enough trust in the measure.
“Nobody likes to cut education,” Lieberman said, “but there is a lack of trust as to how the money will be allocated.”
Schnur also said a large amount of negative advertising by proponents of Prop. 38, the direct competitor with Prop. 30, could have hurt its approval. Similarly, experts said negative messaging directed at Prop. 37 knocked it down in the polls.
“The most significant driving force behind this shift is the amount of money that the opposition has put into the campaign,” Schnur wrote on the Dornsife website. “When voters hear a message so much more strongly from one side than the other, it’s not surprising to see the poll numbers move like this.”
The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll is conducted at regular intervals. The poll, which was conducted by Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner and Republican polling firm American Viewpoint, surveyed 1,504 registered California voters.

Student leaders from across campus gathered over dinner Thursday at USC Hillel to discuss the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship at the second annual Trojan Leadership Dinner.
The dinner, organized by Trojans for Israel, served as a networking opportunity for student leaders and faculty who want to leave a positive impact on the future of the U.S.-Israel relationship.
Networking · David Suissa, an award-winning columnist, talks with Jared Fleitman, a junior majoring in economics-math and mechanical engineering, on Thursday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The evening began with an introduction by Trojans For Israel President Sarah Sax, who emphasized the strong parallels between the United States and Israel.
“Israel is a lot like America,” Sax said. “[It’s] a democracy, a leading country in innovation and a place that emphasizes equality among all.”
The similarities between the two allied nations were emphasized throughout the evening. During dinner, organizers showed a video highlighting the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance since the nation’s inception in 1948.
David Suissa, president of the Jewish Journal, a newspaper in Los Angeles, served as the event’s guest speaker. Suissa, who is also an award-winning columnist and advocate for the Jewish Journal, began the discussion by characterizing Israel as a “messy progress.”
Suissa discussed his complicated relationship with Israel, likening it to a relationship one would share with a brother or a father. Ultimately, however, he described it as a relationship of tremendous loyalty.
“There is nothing normal about Israel,” Suissa said. “It’s not a normal country. And the more you peel back the layers, the more you realize that it’s not a normal country — not at all. And that’s a compliment, by the way. So this is my conflicted relationship with Israel. But ultimately it is a relationship that is nourished by love.”
Among the many students in attendance were Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos, USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad, USC College Republicans President Maddy Lansky and USC College Democrats President Aaron Taxy.
Looking forward, Suissa said he believes the best thing that could happen in the Middle East is if countries took advantage of some of the lessons that Israel has learned the hard way.
“I have dreams that this mess in progress can become a model for the Middle East,” Suissa said. “Because there is so much goodness in this mess — the corrective mechanism that is now going on in Israel — I would love to see that corrective mechanism in Egypt and in Libya and Syria and even in Saudi Arabia.”
Though Israel is not perfect, Suissa said it has the potential to be a role model for all Arab countries in the Middle East.
“Despite all the mistakes that Israel makes — despite the occupation, despite the fact that it hasn’t been able to achieve peace with its neighbors, despite all the things that you hear about Israel — it’s still an incredible, wonderful messy progress,” Suissa said.
Asher Levy, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said he found the event inspiring and a reminder of the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship to the local community.
“It was really heartening to see all of these people from the USC community and the broader pro-Israel community at large come together and show support for the U.S.-Israel relationship,” said Levy. “It really shows the understanding of the fact that this is not simply a niche issue for the Jewish community and for the Israeli community, but rather this is a broader issue for all of those people who are interested in preserving ideals of democracy and freedom and of the American way.”
The remainder of the evening was devoted to questions and answers between Suissa and the audience. Students in the audience posed questions regarding everything from Israel’s perception in the media to the role the upcoming presidential election will play in the U.S.-Israel relationship.
Suissa’s statements point out everything that’s wrong with the Israeli rhetoric about the Middle East. He urges countries in the Middle East, like Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, to take advantage of some of the lessons that Israel has learned the hard way” and use it as a model while ignoring the Palestinian occupation and the tension that still exists in the region. It’s extremely condescending and completely white-washes Israel’s history in the region and current events. Israel continues to forcefully and illegally occupy many regions which belong to the future Palestinian state, infringing on the human rights of the residents, while receiving massive amounts of aid from the United States and its “allies.” Many countries in the Middle East are still in the process of re-building their government following the revolution, and suffered decades of underdevelopment as a result of colonialism and contemporary neocolonialism. To say Israel is a model for the Middle East is not only purposefully demeaning but also ignores the massive amount of help Israel has been granted, the tense conditions of Arab-Israeli relations, and the very real issues which the Arab countries are currently facing internally.
When I see a piece on the US-Israel relationship that has no mention whatsoever of Palestinians or Palestine (except as the faceless entity embodied by the acknowledgement of “occupation”) , I can’t help but think of “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” I would consider it progress (“messy” or otherwise) to discuss the elephant in the room.
Israel  “Emphasizes Equality Among All”?
This is a baldfaced disgustining Lie. Ask the Arabs who “Live” in Israel if they are treated equally. Grow up and get off the koolaid Ms. Sax–nobody is buying this garbage. You should be ashamed of the way Israel treats her Arabs, instead you cover it up. This constant and state-sponsored denial is what perpetuates the conflict between Israel and its neighbors. You cannot fix the problem if you deny it exists. Disgraceful to turn your back on the truth like this.

A recent report released by the NCAA showed that USC varsity athletes who enrolled from 2002-05 graduated at a rate of 79 percent — the seventh-straight year USC’s percentage has increased in this evaluation.
The rate increased from 66 percent in 2007, to 68 in 2008, to 69 in 2009, to 74 in 2010, to 78 in 2011 and now to 79 in 2012, according to the university.
The new figures, however, did not bear all good news for USC.
According to the new numbers, the football program posted a 57 percent graduation rate over the time period — a four-point drop from last year’s figure. In the Pac-12, USC ranked ninth.
For other sports, the picture was a little brighter. Five sports — men’s golf, women’s rowing, men’s tennis, women’s tennis and women’s volleyball — had a 100-percent graduation rate over the time period. Women’s lacrosse and sand volleyball were not evaluated since the NCAA looked at athletes who started college from 2002–05, according to the university.
Notre Dame had the highest national graduation rate for freshmen entering the university from 2002 to 2005, with a rate of 97 percent. Rutgers was ranked second with a 91-percent rate and Stanford was ranked third with a 90-percent rate.

With a 19-3 record and accomplishments from veterans and rookies alike, the No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team has not had to deal with much adversity this season. Coach Mick Haley’s club has made quick work of its opponents, having recorded sweeps in 14 of their 19 wins.

Regardless, the Women of Troy will use this weekend as a measuring tool for their season as they face the No. 5 Huskies on Friday and Washington State on Saturday at the Galen Center.
While the Cougars have struggled and remain winless in Pac-12 competition, the Huskies have fought neck-and-neck with the Women of Troy, having established a 19-2 overall record that includes a 3-0 sweep of USC  when the Women of Troy made their trip to Washington on Sept. 28.
“Our confidence right now is exactly where it needs to be,” senior opposite Katie Fuller said. “After the loss to Stanford we came into practice and challenged ourselves. We not only focused on attacking what we think are our strong points, but also the strong points of our opponents, and that’s what we need to do this weekend against the Washington teams.”
Following a disappointing 3-0 sweep at the hands of the Cardinal on Oct. 10, the Women of Troy responded immediately with a sweep of Cal  on Oct. 12 before dominant home victories over Utah and Colorado last weekend. The weekend featured more strong performances from freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who notched an astounding 11 aces to power the Women of Troy service attack. She also added 18 kills between the matches and nabbed her fourth Freshman of the Week honors to add to her quickly expanding list of accolades.
While Bricio has carried the team on her back, Haley is quick to point out the need to keep things in perspective, especially with teams gunning to take down USC.
“We took both of these teams out with our serving this weekend,” Haley said. “That’s important. But you have to assess how the serving will be against a different team or in a foreign facility. Bricio’s been knocking down aces and we have a combination of different serves we can use, but on the road it’s difficult. Even Bricio is having trouble focusing on the road, just because she’s had to do so much as a freshman.”
While the likes of Fuller, junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard and junior libero Natalie Hagglund have consistently performed well for the team, Haley used the Colorado match to experiment with his younger players, particularly freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms and freshman setter Cinnamon Sary, and stressed the need to give them more playing time.
“Cinnamon is going to be really good, there’s no question,” Haley said. “If she can provide a little more spark, we have a chance to win the national championship. She wants to contribute, so there’s no sense in holding her back, and the team’s comfortable with her in the lineup.”
As the team gears up to battle the Huskies and avenge last month’s loss, Haley stressed the need to focus on the specifics of Washington’s attack.
“We run first tempo, while Washington runs 1.5 tempo in the middle,” Haley said. “They run quicker outside while we run quicker in the middle. The tempos are different but we need to keep improving and become comfortable with our system. Everyone’s feeling like they’re getting better and their focus is high, so we’re in good shape.”
Not much adversity. How about being swept three times by Oregon at home, and Stanford and UW on the road.
All teams ranked ahead of the Trojans. One good win against the ‘ruins. The team’s only win in non-conference vs. a top twenty ( 18th at the time ) club was a five set victory over UCSD played at Galen Ctr. Cinnamon Sary was destined to redshirt until the starting setter struggled forcing some kind of change to improve the offense. Please
define a little more spark which also puts a lot of pressure on one lady to save the season who was not being counted on at all just a couple of weeks ago. How about the coaching staff taking some of the failure to improve
this far into the season.

In a season where hopes have been beaten and battered by injuries, long overtime periods and missed opportunities, the USC women’s soccer team is still holding out hope for redemption this weekend in the form of a potential massive upset.
USC (5-8-3, 2-4-2) hosts No. 1 Stanford (14-1-1, 8-0-0), the defending NCAA champions, on Friday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the team’s biggest match of the season.

If they lose any of their final three matches, all of which are against ranked rivals, the Women of Troy will have essentially no shot at qualifying for the NCAA tournament.
But if they win all three, starting with Friday’s critical showdown against the Cardinal, USC has a chance to earn a berth after missing out last year.
“We’d have to win out, then sit and wait on selection day,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “[We have to] minimize our errors; if we do that, I think we can compete against anybody in the country.”
USC will have to avoid the defensive miscues that have plagued the squad all season if it wants to keep pace with the top-ranked team in the country. The Women of Troy are ranked as the worst defense in the conference with a 1.94 goals-against average.
“[It’s been] disappointing, especially the way a lot of those results have happened off of our own mistakes,” Khosroshahin said. “Like I’ve been saying all year, the biggest opponent we’ve played all year is ourselves.”
The Cardinal, meanwhile, is the highest-scoring team in the Pac-12 by a wide margin, averaging 2.81 goals per game.
“[Stanford] just has great chemistry -— they do whatever it takes to get the job done,” junior midfielder Jordan Marada said. “Everyone just needs to be mentally focused the whole game and come out strong and do what they need to do. We need to finish our chances.”
Unfortunately, converting on opportunities has been a problem for USC all season. The Women of Troy are third in the Pac-12 with 17.62 shots per game, but sixth in goals per game (1.50).
“A lot of it just comes down to us having composure in front of the goal and just putting it in the back of the net,” junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy said. “If we play really good team defense and make sure we stick to the game plan, we’ll be all right.”
After the hyped matchup against Stanford on Friday, USC hosts another ranked foe in No. 21 California (14-3-0, 7-1-0) at McAlister Field on Sunday at 1 p.m.
The Golden Bears stand second in the Pac-12 in goals per game (2.47) behind Stanford, and boast the conference’s top point scorer in forward Ifeoma Onumonu, who has 10 goals and five assists.
But it’s obvious that until the Cardinal exit the Coliseum on Friday night, the Women of Troy are only focusing on their first opponent of the weekend.
“We’re stoked, and can’t wait to get in the Coliseum,” Eddy said. “It’s a great atmosphere to play in. For me, it’s a dream I’ve had since I was a child, so it’s really cool and I’m really excited.”
The players have been making announcements in their classes to encourage classmates to attend the showdown, changing their Facebook profile pictures to a flyer advertising the match and the team’s Facebook page created a “Coliseum Classic” event to raise awareness about the match.
“A lot of people support [the team] if they know about it,” Eddy said. “That’s my goal, to get more awareness.”
Even though the odds are stacked against them, Khosroshahin said the Women of Troy insist they can turn their season around.
“Spirits are high right now,” he said. “We get a chance to play against one of the best teams in the country and see what we’re capable of.”
USC kicks off against Stanford at the Coliseum at 7 p.m., and the first 2,500 fans to enter the gates receive a free drawstring bag.

Re-entering the Heisman Trophy race is more challenging for Matt Barkley now than in August, you might say.
Though setting a Pac-12 and program record for career touchdown passes in USC’s last matchup, a 44-point home win over Colorado, the senior quarterback faces a rather stiff challenge in the hope of becoming the eighth Trojan to win college football’s most prestigious and coveted individual award.
Not out · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley can get back in the Heisman trophy race against Arizona, who surrenders 30.4 points per game. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
Two months ago, Barkley was pitted as the clear frontrunner for the Heisman, as USC stood atop the Associated Press preseason top 25 poll, and was expected to finish the season playing in the BCS national championship game.
But Barkley’s candidacy suffered a rather crushing blow by mid-September following a 21-14 loss at Stanford, the Trojans’ fourth consecutive defeat at the hands of the Cardinal and lone blemish this season.
And so his stock dropped, rather considerably.
“It was especially the style in which they lost,” said Chris Huston, a Heisman Trophy analyst for CBSSports.com and founder of Heismanpundit.com. “It wasn’t like a shootout where he was doing everything he could to keep his team in the game. It was a situation in which this mighty USC offense, with all this talent, was flummoxed.”
Against the Cardinal, Barkley finished 20 of 41 passing, throwing for 254 yards and two interceptions, two plays USC coach Lane Kiffin called afterward “probably two of his worst decisions” at any point during the last three years.
In the wake of the unexpected early season stumble in Palo Alto, USC has won four consecutive games, moving back into the top-10 of the polls, and so Barkley, who should own essentially every meaningful school passing record by the end of the season, is far from out of the running — at least according to the Trojans’ third-year coach.
Kiffin suggested during his post-practice news conference Tuesday that Barkley could play his way back into the race provided he performs in a similar fashion as he did against the Buffaloes last Saturday.
“Like I’ve said all along, the Heisman is a full body of work for the whole year,” Kiffin said. “Everyone wants to figure it out way early. There’s been a lot of Heisman runs, including here, late in the year.”
The senior signal caller was near-perfect versus Colorado, completing 19 of 20 passes for 298 yards and six touchdowns, equaling the school single-game touchdown mark for the fourth time in his career.
“We’ll wait and see,” added Kiffin. “Obviously, if he keeps playing the way he did, I think everybody will be happy.”
Through seven games, Barkley has posted similar numbers at this point one season ago, when he would eventually finish sixth in the voting, along with 11 first-place votes, narrowly missing out on a trip to New York City as one of five finalists.
This season, he’s thrown for 1,773 yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions, compared to the 2,006 yards, 19 touchdowns and four interceptions by this mark in 2011.
Asked Tuesday if he had thought about the race much recently, Barkley offered a simple response: “Nah, it’s not my job.”
But as Kiffin referenced, USC has had quarterbacks make a late push for the award, perhaps most evidenced by Carson Palmer during his Heisman-winning season in 2002. In Palmer’s final two games against rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, he threw for a total of  679 yards and eight touchdowns, catapulting him past Iowa’s Brad Banks.
And so Barkley, who at the moment sits behind favorites Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein and West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith in most Heisman rankings, could face a similar opportunity for late resume-boosting performances. Both No. 4 Oregon and the No. 5 Fighting Irish come to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum next month for primetime, nationally televised showdowns, as well as a potential Pac-12 championship game on Nov. 30, an opportunity the Trojans didn’t have last season because of a postseason ban.
For the time being, USC has kept Barkley out in the weeks following the loss to Stanford. Entering the season, the school launched a mobile app titled “PROJECT TRO7AN,” playing off Barkley’s No. 7 jersey number, and has continued producing the online video series “Barkley Breakdown” and “Matt Versus.” Neither is technically Heisman promotional material, but instead ways to look at the team “through Matt’s eyes,” according to USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone.
Still, how Barkley finishes will likely speak the loudest, especially when it comes to wooing voters.
“You always have to just strike when the iron’s hot,” Tessalone said, “and it’s not hot quite yet.”
So, with at least five games remaining on the slate, the toughest tests await the Pac-12’s newest career leader in touchdown passes. In short, his team will have to win and he’ll have to play particularly well to boot.
As Huston explained, “Voters are waiting to see if USC is actually going to win anything with Matt Barkley, to give those numbers context and meaning. They’re impressed by the numbers but they want to see that these numbers led to X, Y and Z. If ‘SC wins out and does so in convincing fashion, those numbers start to look a lot better.”
2 INT’s against an average AZ team? He’s done. He’s been a huge risk this year – nowhere near last year, and sometimes I cringe when I see him pass.

Though I’m not particularly fluent in the various Internet memes, their origins or why people take the time to generate so many, USC’s clash at Arizona on Saturday conjures one I’ve seen floating around cyberspace: “It’s a trap!”
Points aplenty · Junior wide receiver Robert Woods and the Trojans might find themselves in an old-fashioned shootout against Arizona. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Before continuing, here’s a brief meme history lesson: This meme is derived from a scene in Star Wars Episode VI : Return of the Jedi during which Admiral Ackbar, the foremost military commander of the Rebel Alliance and leader of the Mon Calamari species, famously screams, “It’s a trap!”
To think, Internet notoriety was only a couple of generations away.
Back to football: It’s not the meeting against Arizona itself that inspires trepidation among USC fans, it’s the context. As some of you might have heard, Oregon looms on Nov. 3 in what will be a titanic clash of tradition versus Puddles and Nike’s acid trips.
The basic concept behind a “trap game” is the following: A heavily favored team, either coming off of an emotionally and physically draining game or expecting such a contest in the following week, overlooks its current opponent.
But don’t listen to the rumblings, this is not a trap. USC might very well lose this game, but the Trojans won’t suffer the upset because they overlooked the Wildcats.
Pundits have stretched the trap game concept too thin. Now any time a BCS heavyweight clashes with a talented team flirting with the top 25, it’s ripe for upset because it’s a trap.
But Saturday’s game at Arizona is not a trap; it’s a stiff challenge.
Let’s be honest, USC is currently a 6.5-point favorite. If a team is favored by less than a touchdown, you can’t expect it to overlook its opponent. What’s the logic in that?
By the way, in case you were wondering, USC coach Lane Kiffin is well aware of point spreads. When a reporter inquired about the challenges of motivating his team to play a 40-point underdog in Colorado, Kiffin jokingly reminded him that the spread had since risen to 41 points.
Arizona is by no means a pushover. At least statistically, Arizona’s offense, which ranks fifth nationally, is better than Oregon’s.
Remember the measly 14 points USC mustered against Stanford’s vaunted defensive front seven? Arizona scored 48 points and racked up 617 total yards in an overtime defeat at Stanford Stadium.
Remember USC’s inability to score in the second half against Washington? Arizona just throttled the Huskies 52-17 last Saturday.
For the final time this regular season, the Trojans will board an airplane and venture into hostile territory. The student section in Arizona Stadium, aptly called the “Zona Zoo,” is more raucous than anything USC has experienced up to this point, save for perhaps Rice Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City. Comprised of 10,000 students filling the entire east side of the stadium, the Zona Zoo is a nuisance for opposing offenses, especially ones — like USC — that are prone to false starts and delays of game.
If the Trojans can’t deflate the air out of the rowdy student section early in the game, it might be a long afternoon for USC, especially since all signs point to a classic Pac-12 shoot-out that will entertain fans for four quarters.
A potent, quick-strike spread offense, much like the one Oregon runs, and an amped home crowd, much like the diehards at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore., present Arizona as USC’s toughest challenge to date — perhaps even more so than Stanford.
That said, there’s a reason USC is favored and Arizona has already dropped three games: The Wildcats surrender 30.4 points per game and rank 11th in the Pac-12 in average yards allowed with 464.7 ($5 to the person who can guess the worst defense in the Pac-12 — hint: Senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw six touchdowns against them last week).
Yes, USC rightfully deserves to be favored and Arizona is an imperfect team. But if the Trojans lose Saturday afternoon, don’t immediately dismiss the result as USC overlooking an opponent. Even seven games into the season, it’s still unclear just how imperfect the Trojans are, too.

When Arizona hired Rich Rodriguez after the 2011 season to replace former coach Mike Stoops, most were aware of his talent but also his baggage. After Rodriguez earned two Big East Coach of the Year awards in his career with West Virginia and turned the program into a perennial powerhouse from 2001-07, he announced he was bolting to Michigan in December 2007 after the Mountaineers’ crushing loss to Pittsburgh eliminated them from national title contention.
Explosive matchup · Freshman linebacker Anthony Sarao (left) and senior safety T.J. McDonald (right) will face an offense that averages 352.3 yards passing per game when they face the Wildcats on Saturday. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
During his three years at Michigan, Rodriguez registered a paltry 2-7 record against the Wolverines’ chief in-season rivals Michigan State, Notre Dame and Ohio State. Compounding these on-field woes, he came under fire for excessive abusive language during practice and skirting NCAA rules limiting the amount of time players can practice each week.
But Arizona’s gutsy hire is paying dividends in 2012, because Rodriguez can design an offense around speed — something Arizona features an abundance of.
“It speaks to Rich Rod and his system,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.  “To come in in the first year of a system and completely change a system offensively and put up what they have is really amazing.”
The eye-popping numbers validate Kiffin’s praise. Arizona’s 39.1 points per game rank second in the Pac-12. More impressively, the Wildcats’ 548.7 total yards per game place them fifth among 124 Football Bowl Subdivision teams.
Without question, the catalyst behind this offensive resurgence remains quarterback Matt Scott. After taking the unusual step of redshirting following his junior year, Scott has been a revelation as a dual threat in Rodriguez’s up-tempo, spread-style offense. On the season, Scott has thrown for 2,355 yards and 17 touchdowns, while also running 65 times for 265 yards.
“He’s a phenomenal player,” Kiffin said of Scott. “I didn’t realize he’s as fast as he is — accurate, arm-strength. He’s playing great, doing an unbelievable job with the system.”
One player on the interior defensive line who will be tasked with disrupting Scott’s zone reads is USC freshman defensive tackle Leonard Williams, who learned earlier this week that he would not earn further Pac-12 discipline for his ejection during last Saturday’s game against Colorado.
“I’ve talked to a few people that said they would probably try to do that to me now,” Williams said when asked if future opponents might try to bait him into taking penalties. “But I just won’t let that happen again.”
Williams’ ability to start provides a boost for USC’s defense, which relies heavily on the freshman standout’s penchant for wreaking havoc on opposing offensive lines, as Williams has already registered 5.5 sacks.
On offense, after a stellar aerial assault against an outclassed Colorado pass defense, USC will likely exhibit more balance between the run and the pass against Arizona, especially as a way to control the clock and rest its defense against a Wildcat offense that plays at a fast pace.
“Last weekend was Matt and Woody’s weekend and something I’m really proud to be a part of,” junior running back Silas Redd said, “but I’m definitely happy to run the ball more [this Saturday].”
As prolific as the Wildcats have been on offense, their defense has been porous, surrendering 30.4 points per game (85th in the FBS) and, more distressingly, allowing 291.1 passing yards per game (11th in the Pac-12). Yet the Wildcats will provide a challenge the Trojans have yet to face: a 3-3-5 defense (three defensive linemen, three linebackers and five defensive backs) — something Kiffin admits he has never seen at any level.
Redd, who played minimal snaps against Colorado and gained 13 yards on only three carries, indicated Arizona’s 3-3-5 provides an opportunity to run.
“They play a 3-3 (three defensive linemen, three linebackers), so the box is open a little bit,” Redd said.
Barkley also appeared unfazed by the unconventional formation.
“We’ve faced a lot of odd teams this year, so it’s nothing different,” Barkley said. “It’s actually fairly simple what they do, but they play fast. Because they play simple, they play fast and play downhill.”
With the Wildcats’ 52-17 shellacking of Washington last Saturday at home, the Trojans acknowledge this might be their most daunting challenge thus far.
“This is one of the best teams we’ve played this season up until this point,” Barkley said. “From now on, it’s like the playoffs and you can’t lose to any of these teams we’re playing.”
The game will be televised nationally on ESPN2 and ABC.
Tip to winning the game in the desert.
DO NOT TAKE ARIZONA FOR GRANTED!
This will be one of the toughest games our Trojans will play this year.
They run 80+ plays and pass 80% of the time.
Theeir goal si to wear down the opponent and slam em in the 4th quarter, just like Oregon does.
Good luck and Fight On, always.

Most people think of Halloween as a chance to don outrageous costumes, enjoy delicious candy and check out the seasonal horror movies at the box office.
But the holiday is also a great time to give back to the local and global communities while celebrating the spookiest day of the year. Instead of just trick-or-treating, USC students should consider a different, though by no means less festive, celebration. Alternative Halloween celebrations provide a change of pace from the usual haunted houses and horror films, and unlike the trite, typical Halloween festivities, these events will leave you with more than just a bag full of candy.
Halloween provides an excuse to step outside the realm of the mundane, and the Dream Halloween event in Hollywood, hosted by Alicia Keys’ Keep a Child Alive Foundation, allows guests to do just that. Founded in 2003, Keep a Child Alive improves the lives of children and families affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa and India.
Aside from providing life-saving medication and nutrition, KCA empowers and educates at-risk populations in India, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and South Africa. Volunteers build and furnish clinics with the information and supplies necessary to improve lives in the areas. For this fall season, however, Dream Halloween serves as a posh, star-studded event to raise funds to support KCA’s work.
For the last 19 years, Dream Halloween has been an outstanding celebration, but this year’s events particularly stand out. Saturday’s program features a performance by Victoria Justice as a main attraction, and other highlights include the legendary Trick-or-Treat Lane furnished by Toys “R” Us and Mattel, a haunted forest, a “Mad Hatter’s tea party,” food from Los Angeles’ finest restaurants and freebies for children and adults. Though it might only seem like one big costume party, 86 percent of the funds generated by Dream Halloween go directly toward helping those affected by the AIDS epidemic.
Though the tickets might be a bit out of reach for most students at $300 a person, it’s still possible to participate in this legendary event. As a non-profit organization, KCA depends on volunteers. Positions vary from food service to trick-or-treat bag stuffing to being a costume character who poses for pictures. What better way to enjoy the party and feel good about making a difference in the global community than to volunteer at Dream Halloween?
But even after Oct. 31, it’s possible to stay in the festive Halloween spirit and make a difference in the local community: The AIDS Service Center, for example, will host a masquerade ball in Pasadena on Nov. 3. After holding its first ball in 2006, the ASC revived the tradition last year. The balls help to raise funds and give ASC’s clients and allies a night of frightful fun. This year’s theme, “Six Feet Under: Come As Your Favorite Dead Super Star,” is festively morbid even as it supports a good cause.
Anthony Guthmiller, executive director of the ASC, is the man behind ASC’s Halloween festivities. Guthmiller has been living with HIV for the last 21 years and understands the ongoing societal stresses the disease causes. With ASC, he seeks to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS by providing information and offering support to Pasadena and surrounding communities.
For HIV/AIDS victims, ASC offers care at the personal level. The organization provides transportation and nutrition assistance as well as Back-to-School and Client Holiday Party programs. For Guthmiller and ASC, the goal behind these efforts is “to create awareness.”
But despite ASC’s serious and important mission, the Halloween ball is not an educational event; it is an opportunity for advocates and supporters to raise funds and have a good time. Guthmiller believes the light-hearted atmosphere will help ASC remove the HIV/AIDS taboo from the community.
Though the ASC is leading the way in HIV/AIDS outreach, Guthmiller cites students as the ones who will be responsible for normalizing the HIV/AIDS dialog and changing how society deals with this issue. For the USC community, the Halloween Masquerade Ball is just one way to spread awareness while enjoying the last hurrah of the Halloween season.
ASC will also draw on local culture at its Halloween Masquerade Ball. The ball coincides with the Día de los Muertos holiday and will feature volunteers in Día de los Muertos costumes. In addition, high school and college student volunteers will dress up as zombies and serve as “living-dead” décor at the ball, as advertised in ’SC’s Volunteer newsletter, “Volunteer SConnection.”
Though ASC is not directly present on campus, Guthmiller encourages student involvement in ASC’s other events throughout the year and to reach beyond the L.A. community and support HIV/AIDS education and prevention. The Service Center helps to break down societal boundaries by holding unique fundraisers such as their signature home architectural showcase and drag queen bingo.
Clearly, Halloween is much more than a time for candy and costumes. From KCA to ASC, the L.A. community is brimming with unique charities and exciting volunteer opportunities. This year, explore alternative Halloween celebrations and help make a difference in the global and local communities. The experience is sweeter than candy and will leave you with a warm jack-o’-lantern glow well into November.

The calendar not only forecasts the changing of the seasons but also our annual culture patterns. With summer blockbusters and barbecues long gone but the winter still a ways away from sweeping everyone up in the holiday spirit, it’s a special time indeed. Nights are cooling, leaves are changing (although perhaps not in Los Angeles) and, most important of all, the ravenous hordes of Hell are breaking free to fill our heads with nightmares. Yes, all ye faithful, it’s time for Halloween.
The second most commercially successful holiday behind Christmas, All Hallow’s Eve means something different for everyone. For children, it’s all about the trick-or-treating. The target demographic of this fine publication has a bevy of costume parties currently in the “stock up on beverages and more-sultry-than-average attire” phase. But then there are those who really get into the spirit: the horror junkie, the fear enthusiast, the scare nut. By any other name, these are the people who thrive on that primal adrenaline rush, that fight-or-flight high generated by good old reliable terror.
Sure, fear might be a negative response, but it can come mixed with such fun that, on occasion, we choose to be scared. And a select few simply can’t get enough. For them, there’s no time like October, and it’s not hard to see why. When scares are the goal, what could compare to the way the culture engine panders to that very desire?
It’s a month when the cinematic landscape is dominated not by action or comedy, but week after week of offerings from the oft-maligned horror genre. Sure, the truly effective ones are few and far between, but if there’s one time of the year when the odds of a must-see scary movie are favorable, there’s no question this is it. This year, the chief contender is Sinister, the tale of an obsessive true-crime writer who, in pursuit of his next big hit, moves his wife and children to the same home where a family was recently slaughtered. It’s not quite a classic, but the content of a box of home movies he finds in his attic might set even some fairly jaded horror film fans on edge.
For those in the market for slightly less original fare, there’s the already-traditional Paranormal Activity franchise, with its shaky “real” camera work based on “real” events. The fourth installment was released to significantly less critical acclaim than the first three, but for a yearly series to maintain a streak of quality for even that long is a feat in and of itself.
That’s not to say the forces behind these found footage flicks don’t have anything worthwhile in store for horror fans this year — but they might be found beyond a theater. A couple blocks away from LA Live lies a new spooky attraction: The Blumhouse of Horrors, from Paranormal Activity and Insidious producer Jason Blum. Open until Nov. 3, this big-budget haunted house will appeal to anyone looking for something a little more involving than your run-of-the-mill demon possession movie. It features a giant cast and a wealth of disturbing tableaux to keep guests impressed, scared and entertained for the 30-plus minutes required to traverse its depths.
Far more than horror films, haunted houses like these are a Halloween experience. There are scary movies released at other times of the year, after all, and, of course, the classics can be watched anytime. Physically walking through an environment designed to terrify, on the other hand, can’t be done with a Netflix account.
That’s why theme parks capitalize on this opportunity with attractions like Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights and Knott’s Scary Farm. There’s nothing quite like the fear that comes from being in the thick of it yourself.
When it comes to these attractions, there’s an undisputed master. The Blackout Haunted House, from Vortex Productions, is supposedly an experience like no other. Since its appearance in New York in 2009, it’s built a reputation as the single most terrifying piece of entertainment patrons can willingly subject themselves to. Participants must be older than 18, go through alone and sign a lengthy waiver beforehand that confirms they know what they’ll be getting into. From that point, they’ll suffer through terror that encompasses much more than just actors jumping out of corners. Participants will be physically harassed, humiliated and bombarded with violent and sexual imagery. Last year’s incarnation (for it changes drastically every time) apparently went so far as to waterboard its patrons. Yes, to brave Blackout is akin to volunteering to be tortured.
The fact that it grows in popularity as it becomes ever more notoriously intense confirms that if there’s a threshold for the level of horror people can enjoy experiencing, those in the fear business haven’t quite reached it yet. And with Blackout expanding for the first time to a second location right here in Los Angeles, a whole new audience has the opportunity to test its mettle by embracing the most extreme elements that Halloween has to offer.
Whatever the level of fright one is comfortable with facing, whether it’s the gut-wrenching end of the spectrum that Blackout dominates, the more tame films being offered or merely costumed partying and candy consumption, this is certainly the time to enjoy it. But don’t forget that it’s also a perfect opportunity to take a few risks and step out of that comfort zone. For these few weeks, there’s nothing so dear as fear itself.

Listeners could always depend on …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead to release solid albums that have just as much melody as they do noise, just as much soul as they do thrash and are just as blithe as they are intense.
The über-talented rockers from Austin, Texas, have carved out a niche for themselves in the music world that ensures their clout in the realm of passion-punk. After all, you don’t just listen to Trail of Dead — you experience them.
Though the band has been recording since the mid-1990s, it didn’t achieve the level of success and acclaim it deserved until 2002’s Source Tags & Codes, the group’s third studio album. From post-punk to progressive rock, Trail of Dead has always incorporated numerous elemental genre styles into its music, yet underneath all the noise are beautiful melodies and a tight musical execution that only a skilled band would be able accomplish.
Trail of Dead has long been churning out virtually perfect albums that have hardcore  intensity but the melodic foundation of alt-rock. The group pulls off this stylistic collocation effortlessly, and the result is music that transports the listener to a thoroughly enjoyable mental circle pit of epicness.
The band has perfected the noise, melody and dramatics that complement its post-punk sound, and  Lost Songs is no exception to this winning formula. The band’s eighth studio album is chock-full of the careful chaos that defines the band, with the meticulous instrumentalism and melodies weaving through the pitch-perfect yells of frontmen Jason Reece and Conrad Keely.
Recorded over the summer in Hanover, Germany, Lost Songs focuses on social issues of justice, war, apathy and oppression.
The album kicks off with the pounding “Open Doors,” a powerhouse of an opener that wastes absolutely no time in throwing the listener into the characteristically intense Trail of Dead universe. Though the dramatic hard-rock sound is what Trail of Dead is best known for, the band changes up its sound in Lost Songs.
The unflinching command of songs, such as “Place To Rest” and “Pinhole Cameras,” is juxtaposed with the heavy and mysterious “Flower Card Games” and the breezy yet nerve-wracking guitars of “Time And Again.”
The band keeps things interesting with “Awestruck,” a surprisingly basic and beautiful alt-rock song, with the musical hints of frenzy and threats of tumult never fully materializing. This parallelism is unified in its aural experience — the steadily frantic drums are the star in “Opera Obscura’s” intensity, and to have that kind of hard drive be effortlessly tied together with the simplicity of “Awestruck” is the kind of talent Trail of Dead has honed for years.
If there’s one thing Trail of Dead knows how to do, it’s tipping points — each song is intertwined with the band’s trademark intense climax, either driving and heavy or soft and cryptic, but never losing its place. The deep buildup of “Bright Young Things” sounds like delightful chaos at first listen, yet somehow the band manages to never miss a note or a beat. Sharp musicianship is its own entity with Trail of Dead, and Lost Songs manages to be musically painstaking, yet not overly produced.
As Keely writes on the band’s official website, “The music was partly inspired by the apathy to real world events that has plagued the independent music scene now for over a decade. It was also inspired by artists such as the Cure, KARP, Ros Sereysothea, Human League, Hildegard von Bingen, and a few others. We feel that because the lyrics can say more about the album than we could, we would simply share them with you.”
Keely also took the time to dedicate the album to artists who fought in the face of oppression, including feminist Russian punk-rock group Pussy Riot. Three members of the collective were arrested earlier this year for staging an impromptu performance at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, and though one member was released on probation with her sentence suspended earlier this month, the other two women have had their two-year imprisonment sentences upheld. The incident has gained much attention around the world, and the notion of free speech has once again become a hot topic of debate in the art world.
Regarding Lost Songs, Keely states, “We would like to dedicate our efforts to Pussy Riot, and any and all artists who have attempted to exercise their creativity under the oppression of government, as well as the endemic oppression of an indifference to passion present in our mainstream culture.”
Trail of Dead has once more refined its punk sensibilities with Lost Songs — for a band known for making pummelling and heavy music, Trail of Dead never leaves behind its flair to decorate its noise with intricate musical compositions. Lost Songs is an unwavering testament to the band’s acclaim and, in the group’s trademark style, creates a new world for the listener to willingly get lost in. With all the intensity, drive and passion the band conjures in listeners, it’s impossible not to feel more alive than ever when walking the Trail of Dead.

Federal authorities closed a number of medical marijuana dispensaries throughout Downtown Los Angeles in September as part of an effort to cut down on the sale and use of the drug, which is legal in California for medical purposes but still considered illegal by the federal government.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
This month, the Drug Enforcement Administration followed up by sending warning letters and revisiting several dispensaries. This series of shutdowns was not only unnecessary, but it was also a violation of state rights and an indication of broken promises on the part of President Barack Obama. As marijuana regulation is becoming a hot button issue in the presidential race, such an infringement on an individual state’s rights is unacceptable.
Given the size and scope of the federal crackdown operation — it began in San Diego and recently spread to Los Angeles — it’s obvious that significant planning went into these raids. Obama deliberately went back on his word and has been doing so for a long time. This is an unusual move so close to the election but, more importantly, it challenges the legitimacy of California’s laws.
Whether or not a state allows the sale of medical marijuana, the fact remains that marijuana is federally illegal, so it would seem the owners of dispensaries should have known the risks associated with their businesses. They thought, however, that under the Obama administration they could operate without having to worry about being shut down because of early campaign promises.
Beyond broken campaign promises, however, the crackdown signals a disconnect between state and federal government and also raises a larger issue on state rights. The federal government took advantage of the disconnect between California and the federal government to fine and shut down target dispensaries. This is more than just a backward step in the legalization debate, it’s a disregard for the rights of individual states and offers a critical example of overbearing federal power. To maintain a better balance between federal and state, medical marijuana regulation must be returned to states’ control.
The issue of medical marijuana has largely been ignored in the 2012 presidential election, and understandably so. Federal versus state control of medical marijuana has no bearing on the United States’ global standing or on foreign policy matters. And while marijuana’s legalization generates substantial tax revenue, there are far bigger fish to fry when it comes to solving the nation’s deficit. All in all, medical marijuana might be a hotly debated topic, but it isn’t a particularly significant one in terms of impact. For the federal government to waste time, energy and money on medical marijuana enforcement is simply inefficient. By allowing states to control the regulation of their own medical marijuana dispensaries, the time and money the federal government is currently wasting can be re-directed somewhere much more worthwhile.
If the federal government took over the regulation of marijuana dispensaries, not only would its leadership be inefficient, it would potentially take away jobs from those who own legitimate, legal dispensaries. For every illegally run collective, it’s important to remember there is a legitimate non-profit organization that employs Americans and provides free marijuana to patients who can’t afford it but need it for actual medical purposes.
We need the government to be effective and consistent. The global society and economy is at a point where America will be in a very dangerous position if some important issues are not dealt with directly and in a consistent manner. Especially considering that medical marijuana is much less consequential than many other issues currently facing the federal government, wasting resources to take away states’ rights is something the government can’t afford to be doing.

While the nation’s attention remains fixated on the upcoming Nov. 6 election, the Drug Enforcement Administration has been systematically cracking down on medical marijuana operations across California, most recently in Los Angeles — even though such operations are 100 percent legal statewide. But marijuana is still federally classified as an illegal drug, and President Barack Obama’s administration has been making renewed efforts to enforce federal law, however much they conflict with state and individual rights.
This begs the question: Should medical marijuana be regulated on a federal or state level?
Because marijuana in its legal form is a health benefit, no state should have the authority to take that away. The current administration’s crackdowns are not the right way to regulate, but they are right to take action when state regulation is not working. Medical marijuana must be federally regulated to ensure that medical access is provided for all who need it, regardless of what state they live in.
In 1970, marijuana was categorized by the government in 1970 as a Schedule I drug. Schedule I drugs must meet three conditions to be labeled as such: the drug has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Despite research that has proven all three of these conditions to be false, marijuana remains an illegal drug within the Schedule I category.
Medical marijuana, however, is legal in 17 states, including California, and measures proposing some level of legalization are currently pending in six others. The state legalization movement is growing fast, and as it does, so is the tension between the conflicting doctrines in state and federal regulation of the drug. This tension only contributes to further problems for everyone involved — business owners, medical patients and President Barack Obama himself, whose Daily Beast-dubbed “war on weed” might be angering some of his supporters. Having different laws in different states on the legality of a substance that is ridiculously easy to transport only creates chaos in the legal system and distracts from the fact that this is an issue about medical access and benefits, not governmental powers.
Federal regulation is opposed by those who see medical marijuana as a state issue that should be dealt with at a local, specific level. Nearly 1 million patients nationwide depend on medical marijuana for their health and are in accordance with state laws, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Marijuana has been proven to provide relief for serious conditions such as cancer or AIDS — relief that has not been reproduced by any other drug or medicine. So what about cancer or AIDS patients who live in the 27 states where medical marijuana remains illegal?
Should they bide their time until a ballot measure passes? Especially in incredibly conservative states, the likelihood of such a measure passing is small, considering Proposition 19 didn’t pass in liberal California in 2010. State efforts, as the past couple years have demonstrated, take too long to succeed and do not guarantee the results that patients in need deserve.
Though no debate over the regulation of marijuana can ignore the rampant recreational use and illegal sale and purchase of the drug, regulation must be re-framed as a medical issue. Medical marijuana is a health benefit that all Americans should be able to take advantage of if they need to do so — and federal regulation would guarantee that.
The current federal administration, however, has failed to acknowledge that. The DEA’s recent efforts to mend the gap between state and federal government are wrong and only perpetuate inconsistency and conflict. Raids, crackdowns, warning letters and the like are not the answer. It will take a change at the federal, not the state level, to effectively ensure safe and guaranteed use of medical marijuana for Americans in all states.

What agency is responsible for regulating ALL medicines in this country?  I believe it’s at the Federal level, is it not?
Don’t break the law. Simple as that people
The eating, drinking, smoking, inhaling, or injection of NO substance (including marijuana) should be regulated by ANY governmental authority.
@Grimnir gave the correct answer.
All card-carrying members of the DEA need to read: Shoulda Robbed a Bank
Here is one of its reviews: 
5.0 out of 5 stars… If David Sedaris had written ‘Catcher in the Rye’..this would be it, June 30, 2012
Amazon Verified Purchase 
This review is from: Shoulda Robbed a Bank (Kindle Edition) 
I have never smoked pot in my life…nor do I ever care to.
I read about this book in numerous Huffington Post comments. Thought I would read it because I know nothing about marijuana or the people involved with it. I am ecstatic that I did. Funny, Funny, Funny!!!
The chapters are like short stories. Stories about unloading boats with helicopters, close encounters with law enforcement, traveling through the jungles of South America. The chapter about the author’s first time smoking marijuana made me feel like I was with him…coughing.
All of the characters were just a group of loveable, nice guys and girls. Not what I had been raised to believe…hysterical maniacs high on pot bent on death and mayhem. They were nothing like that.
If you have ever read any of David Sedaris’ books, and like them…you will love Shoulda Robbed a Bank.
And the crazy things happening reminded me of Holden Caufield in ‘Catcher in the Rye’ and the way he staggered through life.
The way the words are put together are like nothing I have ever heard. I am sure I will use many of the sayings found in this book just to dazzle my friends. A terrific read. I love this book.
The prohibition of marijuana is a farce.  We are a free people.  It is time to start living the way our forefathers intended.
Law enforcement needs to re-direct its focus on crime…to those that are REAL crimes.
I was in Federal Prison for 5 years for a marijuana offense. No, it was not for simple possession. I was arrested aboard a Lockheed PV2 in Marianna, Florida…charged and convicted for conspiracy to import and distribute 12,000 pounds of marijuana.
At the time, I really had no idea what I had gotten myself into…mine was an offense involving pot…the thought never occurred to me that I may actually spend years in prison for that ‘indiscretion.’
As my years in prison rolled by, what I did see were armed bank robbers, coming and going…while I still sat there for marijuana. Most of the bank robbers only spent 17 to 24 months. But, I and my fellow ‘drug offenders,’…we stayed for YEARS.
I wrote about the escapades that led to my incarceration. I admit, I had a great time. No one was injured, no one was killed, firearms were not involved…there were no victims.
We were Americans…doing what Americans do best…living free.
Truly, it is time for this lunacy to end…it never should have begun.
My book: Shoulda Robbed a Bank 
It is about living free.
I would be honored by your review.
I agree, Bryan. It baffles me that alcohol and tobacco are widely accepted even with research demonstrating  negative health consequences and high death rates.
Also, the intention of drug dealers is to maximize their profits and will most likely not request ID  hen they’re selling to minors. Having extensive experience working with youth, I’ve witnessed street drug dealers selling to children/youth as young as 7. By legalizing it, I personally think our society can better regulate and minimize street-level drug sales. Yes, teens will find ways to get fake ID to purchase of it’s legalized, but I’m quite certain a “store” selling marijuana can differentiate between a 7 year old and one whom might be of legal  age (versus a 16 year old and using a fake ID). And again drawing from experience, I have yet to see drug dealers sell a Bud Light, a bottle of Grey Goose or a bottle of pinot noir discreetly to children on the side of an alley
Refusing to allow states to regulate marijuana gives power to drug cartels and denies the states millions of dollars in income. How anyone in this day and age thinks that marijuana is any worse than alcohol or tobacco is a mystery to me. Personally, I think it’s due to pressure from lobbyists from pharmaceutical companies that fear homegrown solutions that they cannot profit from. Why else would THC pills be legal but the plant it is derived from illegal?
