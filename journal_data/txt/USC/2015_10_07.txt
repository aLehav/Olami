What happens in your mind when you read this sentence — and you hit the dash?
Did you pause? If so, how long did you pause for? I imagine it was longer that you normally would for spaces between words, and about as long as you would for a semicolon, colon or a parentheses.
This versatile tool — called an em-dash — can be a wonderful tool in a writer’s arsenal. I’ve already given two examples of the em-dash: one where the end of the sentence is emphasized, and a second where parentheses would be too disruptive in the flow of reading (so I put two em-dashes instead). Proper placement of dashes can give sentences a cadence they might otherwise lack. Sometimes, the em-dash is simply the best punctuation to use.
I think I will, no, I’m going to do it. I think I will — no, I’m going to do it.
The clarity offered by the em-dash in the place of a comma might not save lives, but it can certainly save an exhausted reader puzzlement.
A great quality about em-dashes is that they can be used so widely. Yet, a great writer uses em-dashes sparingly. If I — in so explaining the em-dash — decide to continuously use the device — perhaps even six times in a sentence — you — the reader — will likely become very, very bored. The previous sentence is, in fact, grammatically correct. But it is not one I would like to see in an article I copy edit, nor one I imagine your professor would like to see as he/she is grading your essay.
An easy way to avoid monotony is to vary the punctuation used. I am a huge fan of the em-dash, but I still occasionally try to throw in a semicolon or colon for variation. What is important to remember while writing is this: your writing includes the punctuation you choose. All your punctuation will be interpreted a certain way. With the use of the colon two sentences ago, a reader would implicitly understand that the phrase after the colon was meant to qualify the phrase before the colon. Thus, even when you have decided you want your reader to feel a mental “pause” in one part of your sentence and you plan to achieve that effect using punctuation, you still have to pick the correct form of punctuation to use.
Worrying about little points of punctuation, especially things like em-dashes, might seem tedious. But trust me. If you use punctuation to its full effect, you can get your reader to really pause — and appreciate your work.

With midterm season now upon us, it is time to find those perfect playlists to power you through every study session, especially during that semester slump. I’m talking about those playlists that will keep you focused on problem sets and essays, the ones that will almost distract from the fact you’ve missed a week’s worth of TV episodes. I’ve complied the best of 8tracks.com to bring you four playlists, a.k.a. your new favorite study buddies to last your until finals. 
Sing-Along Studying:
The playlist “For Studying 2.0” is perfect for the academic who loves to sing along as they work. Featuring instrumental versions of Charlie Puth’s hit singles and the music of Cameron Thomas, the music is relevant and contagious — o much so that you’ll never want to hit pause. efore you know it that essay will be finished.

for studying 2.0 from shelbyhoff on 8tracks Radio.
Keeping it Classic:
Studies have found that listening to classical music while studying enhances memory and productivity. For those that wish to have a side of Mozart with their third coffee of the day, “Classical Studying” is for you. It is a beautiful collection of eight classical tracks to offer that extra brain boost. 

Classical Study from thefebpersonalities on 8tracks Radio.
Jazz It Up:
When you want to break out of your usual study mix, jazz is a great way to change things up. Instrumental jazz is never the first genre that comes to mind for studying,but I have found it remarkably calming. Let the soothing sounds of saxophone, muffled drums and skillful keyboard transport you from Leavey to an underground coffee house. 

jazz for the afternoon  from cesjun2007 on 8tracks Radio.
Electronic Vibes:
We are part of a generation where instrumental music is not necessarily associated with the classical, but with synth and bass instead. For some of us, our brains have acclimated to find these types of tracks more engaging than the traditional piano composition. “Chill Vibes” delivers vibey remixes of Troye Sivan and other indie electronic artists that make you want to power through studying just so you can go out and dance. Finish that problem set and make your way to that hip club in Silver Lake you’ve been dying to check out.

As college students, bikes are a big part of our culture. They’re a fast, easy way to get around campus. Unlike our crosstown rivals, we enjoy a flat, level campus that is easy to maneuver with almost any mode of transportation. With a sizable amount of students utilizing a bicycle to get from point A to point B, naturally problems will arise, and the bicycle situation at USC has become increasingly more problematic with each passing year.
Racks near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, where students used to be able to park their bikes, no longer exist, forcing students to park farther away from their destination, and thus defeating the purpose of riding a bike. Aside from on Trousdale Parkway, there are no designated bike lanes across campus, causing confusion, dozens of near-accidents and actual accidents involving bicyclists. Walking as a pedestrian on campus during the day has almost become an Olympic sport, dodging the scores of bikes, skateboarders, scooters and others. No one is arguing to discourage or ban bikes from campus — they are an integral and important part of campus life and identity — but there needs to be more of a concerted effort to keep bicyclists and pedestrians safe. Clearly marked and labeled lanes for bicyclists across campus, as well as increased spots to park bikes in strategic locations near buildings, would help clear traffic and congestion on campus during peak hours.
Another important factor in bicycles at USC is theft. It’s an unfortunate reality at USC, and it’s prevalent especially in bikes. The Department of Public Safety encourages students to register their bikes, lock their bikes with a U-lock or superior safety feature and remain cognizant and cautious of their bike at all times.
But even with these measures, bicycles are still stolen. Efforts such as Ryde, a program started by USC students, aim to promote bike-sharing, which shifts away from ownership and discourages stealing as there is an incentive to share. Even the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority is getting in on the ride-sharing, introducing an $11 million project that will showcase 1,100 bikes at 65 stations throughout downtown Los Angeles. Both ride-sharing opportunities are great initiatives that alleviate the cost on riders and help decrease the issues of theft and parking.
There are still leaps to be made in order to put the brakes on a bicycle situation that may be spinning out of control if nothing is done. Today, it is virtually impossible to park a bike near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Guards and security near the Campus Center now monitor the parking of bikes and tell students to move if bikes are parked near pathways.
The ban on bikes in front of the Campus Center is actually not entirely bad. It has cleared up space tremendously and allowed for further seating, and it’s important for all students, including disabled students, to be able to access the Campus Center. But rather than simply eliminating parking spots, the bike racks should have been moved to an alternative location. When students would just park their bike anywhere, it was a maze to get into the Campus Center, but it has also become frustrating when students are told to move bikes and park elsewhere when there is almost nowhere to park nearby.
At USC, we enjoy a beautiful campus that allows us to maneuver and get around in a variety of different ways. You can walk, bike, skateboard, scooter and even unicycle to class. It is one advantage that we may take for granted. We need to work together to not spoil that luxury and find a mutually agreed upon solution.
It’s often joked that pedestrians hate bicyclists, skateboarders hate bicyclists and even bicyclists hate bicyclists. It doesn’t have to be that way. Bikes are an iconic part of USC. You can’t picture a building on campus that doesn’t have bikes parked outside.
Bikes at USC have become a microcosm of automobiles in Los Angeles, but Leavey Library and the Campus Center don’t have to be the 405. There are ways to get ourselves moving while at the same time keeping our campus presentable and navigable — they’re not mutually exclusive. We just have to get in the right gear.

On Thursday, students will head to the Coliseum in light of their rescheduled class — or just skip class entirely — to watch the Trojans play the Huskies. It’s no secret that USC loves football. An excuse for tailgates, camaraderie and painting huge cardinal and gold letters on our bellies, football is a fiery tradition for the Trojan Family. But while the audience enjoys the hard-hitting, fast-action plays that bring excitement to the game, it is the players who pay the ultimate price. A new study published this September on the website of the Concussion Legacy Foundation by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University found chronic traumatic encephalopathy — a neurodegenerative disease that results from repeated concussive or subconcussive blows to the head — in the brains of 87 out of 91 former NFL players who donated their brains to science. As a student body, we must stop worshipping a sport that puts its athletes’ health at risk.
The worst injuries on the field are invisible, at least to the naked eye. When a safety tackles a wide receiver, changes are taking place on the microscopic level. Axons, the flexible arms of neurons that transmit information away from the cell, undergo wear and tear due to frequent collisions. Moreover, analysis of brain tissue of football players reveals buildup of Tau proteins, the culprits of Alzheimer’s Disease. MRI reveals alterations in brain structure as well. A Johns Hopkins University imaging study earlier this year revealed shrinkage of the hippocampus — a region responsible for emotion and memory — due to injury in the brains of retired NFL athletes. The microscopic changes, as well as the permanent brain damage observed through MRI, are mirrored by mental health alterations and cognitive deficits; depression, learning deficits and memory loss are just some of the devastating symptoms of this disease. Former USC linebacker and NFL Hall-of-Famer Junior Seau is a tragic example of the psychological toll a football career can have on a player. Famous for his hard-hitting tackles, Seau suffered seven years of insomnia before committing suicide in 2012. After Seau’s family donated his brain to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an autopsy revealed signs of CTE.
Though Seau is an example of how a lifetime of football can wreak havoc on the brain, even a shorter career in college can likely lead to long-term mental health degradation. The aforementioned Boston University study found that of 74 brains of athletes who played just semi-professional, college or high school football, 58 percent showed signs of CTE. Alarmingly, even players who have not experienced a concussion can still show signs of cognitive deficits. A study published in 2014 in the Journal of Neurotrauma by a group at Purdue University found that high school players who suffered head injuries but were not diagnosed with concussions “demonstrated measurable neurocognitive (primarily visual working memory) and neurophysiological impairments.”
Though coaches and the athletic staff promote a safe environment for their players, no amount of equipment can change the physics of a head-on collision. While the worst cases of the disease have occurred in the NFL, NCAA athletes are no less vulnerable, or less immune, to CTE’s horrible symptoms later in life.
A sport that puts its athletes at risk for a debilitating disease cannot exist alongside the principles of student health and wellness, unless of course we ignore the long-term consequences — which we have successfully done. It is not that fans are ignorant of mental health, but rather that they will assume disavowal amid celebration. Fans roar when a lineman sacks a quarterback with full-force. We applaud the violence, the sheer power and the athleticism that come with a tackle while turning a blind eye to the tremendous toll on the brain.
Football is a great thing for America and a student body. Trojan football especially is a grand, unifying force in Los Angeles. The event draws alumni and the entire community around USC together in celebration. Many argue that to end football would be to eliminate a powerful source of happiness and unification. But there are many ways to bring the community together besides football. Concerts, festivals, community outreach events, street fairs and cultural celebrations all overflow in a city as diverse and intricate as Los Angeles, and football games make up a small percentage of calendar events. It is time we ended our obsession with football — and change the sport before it changes the players.

“Let’s award honorary degrees to violent criminals” probably isn’t a statement you’d want your school to make. There is no discernable reason, then, as the University of San Francisco joins multiple universities of varying prestige — including Brown University, Fordham University and Marquette University — in the rescission of comedian and actor Bill Cosby’s honorary degrees, that USC has so passively sat by allowing the recognition the University gifted Cosby to stand. USC does not tolerate sexual assault. It has told students so over and over again, be it in handbooks, housing contracts, Department of Public Safety public notifications or a freshman health and safety seminar. And yet, here at USC, Cosby’s degree stands: a Doctorate of Fine Arts.
One could make the claim that Cosby’s 1998 degree was awarded quite a while ago — perhaps long enough ago to render it irrelevant. After all, the actor has not appeared at USC since then — he has not given commencement addresses or graduation speeches, does not visit from time to time like other celebrity alumni and is largely absent from the community. Even more importantly, though he admits to “extramarital relationships” with several of the women who have come forward to speak about his attacks, he has not yet been convicted of rape.
Rape is a heavy term and, unfortunately, all too common — especially on university campuses such as USC. Rape culture is alive and well in the United States. It is a lingering caution in university life. However, it is also so muddled in our country’s long-lasting Puritanical ethos surrounding sexual subject matter, that for many years the most palatable solution traditional power structures could find was to sweep it under the rug — to quiet the victims, if society didn’t do that much on its own.
But USC isn’t a school tolerant of sexual assault and has pledged not to stand idle if students are attacked. It has funded programs that aid survivors and educational activities that inform the student body about the various classifications, definitions and prevention methods of sexual violence. The state of California passed its own “Yes Means Yes” law last year, requiring explicit consent from both parties, and it appears that USC holds its students to the same strict standards.
But it is not enough.
USC cannot claim to wish to prevent sexual violence and in the same breath withhold judgment on the actions of a serial rapist, a man who has committed such an insidious crime against dozens of people. The University should uphold its stalwart standing against sexual violence. USC should absolutely, unequivocally revoke Cosby’s honorary degree.
Opposition points to the fact that Cosby has not faced formal conviction, and they are, in a literal sense, correct — he has not been convicted. But an empty award such as this surely means little now, and it certainly means little to a multimillionaire in the last years of his life.
But USC must revoke the degree in condemnation of this behavior for the community that resides at USC and beyond, for every survivor, every one of his or her friends and family and for the student body that entrusts this University with the protection of individual rights. The University should send the message that the Trojan Family does not approve of these actions. The University must divest itself from association with Cosby.
The University must make the decision to stand in solidarity with its own community of survivors as well as that of the nation to greater support the movement toward the eradication of the silent disregard of sexual assault. The honorary degree itself is almost nothing to the perpetrator, even less of a headache for the University itself — but it represents a large step in the elimination of campus rape, and of rape culture in America as a whole.
The University of Southern California should not be, and should never be, a bystander.
Just another ploy to condemn without evidence and punish those who choose to wait the outcome of the legal system
Time to stop using Judd Apatow as a spokesman to fight rape when he supports sex offenders like Amy Schumer college rapist,, Lena Dunham,child molestor,  Andy Dick sex predator,, Paul Ruebens child porn, those alleged support groups who use deviant behavior on their pages for an agenda to destroy Cosby prove they are not supporting victims of rape but instead focusing solely on a smear campaign using this trash where they lack any evidence.
Excellent piece!

On the surface, The Assassin might seem like the typical wuxia film, characteristic of martial art heroes. With beautiful displays of Chinese martial art and scenery, the film follows a female assassin, Nie Yinniang (Shu Qi), who is ordered to kill Tian Ji’an (Chang Chen), Weibo’s corrupt military ruler to whom she was once betrothed. Though the film boasts beautifully choreographed fight sequences familiar to the wuxia genre, ultimately The Assassin is a story of Yinniang and her inner turmoil.
Directed by Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao-Hsien, the film has already garnered much critical praise. After it premiered at Cannes Film Festival in May, Hou won the award for Best Director. Now, The Assassin is Taiwan’s pick for their entry in the Best Foreign Film for the Academy Awards — with good reason, starting with the film’s innovative structure. With the beginning shot in black and white, a prologue explains Yinniang’s main motivations. She has to answer to the beck and call of a nun-princess who took her from her family when she was 10 years old. After extensive training, Yinniang’s fight skills are unmatched, and thus, she is tasked with killing corrupt government officials. For the most part, Yinniang is detached from her targets, which is shown by her lack of remorse when stealthily killing a man on horseback. However, when Yinniang is faced with a situation in which her target is shown to be a loving father, she relents and fails her mission. With invigorating cinematography, the prologue highlights Yinniang’s sensitive nature. When the rest of the film adopts color, it reveals less about Yinniang’s character. The dichotomy of this is brilliant.
The Assassin also boasts excellent performances by Shu and Chang. Shu’s stoic, female Robin Hood character conveys the most in what she doesn’t say. In a style that resembles Mrs. O’Brien in Terrence Malick’s Tree of Life, Yinniang’s lack of dialogue brings out the emotional weight she has to carry throughout the film. Chang, on the other hand, is the perfect counterpart to Yinniang’s contained character, actively expressing his volatile rage at his council, his wife and the downfall of the Tang dynasty.
Also adding to the success of the film is the percussive backdrop. To inject suspense into the scenes, viewers will find that the absence of a pervasive musical score moves the plotline along. Chinese drums accelerate as situations become more tense or as Yinniang closes in on her target. This element allows audiences to feel a gripping sense of Yinniang’s task.
Of course, with any wuxia film, the unspoken character is the elegant Chinese scenery. Captured expertly by Hou’s frequent collaborator, director of photography Mark Lee Ping Bing, the setting of The Assassin looks as if it comes from a classic Chinese painting. The shots are so beautiful that they rival modern wuxia classics such as Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Zhang Yimou’s Hero and House of Flying Daggers. The nature background contrasts the Tang dynasty’s fledging opulence and underscores the tense relationships between the kingdoms.
To portray the depraved environment in which Ji’an rules, many of the shots at his palace are shot behind a veil. This suggests that the relationships in the film are shrouded in mystery, especially that of Ji’an and Yinniang. This addition adds to the profundity of the film.
That being said, this doesn’t mean that The Assassin comes without faults. Yinniang isn’t the only character who speaks seldomly in the film. The scarcity of dialogue is a running theme for all the characters. This contributes to the film being hard to follow at times, as the actions of the characters imply their objectives. However, this characteristic is a stylistic choice of Hou, allowing Yinniang’s journey, the scenery and the pacing of the film to speak for itself.
Ultimately, The Assassin isn’t for those who are looking for senselessly violent fun. The film is composed of dimensional characters who are at war with themselves and majestic landscapes. Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s critically acclaimed film proves that he is a champion of the wuxia genre.

Canberra might be the capital of Australia, but Melbourne is the capital of Australian football. Affectionately called “footy” by its fans, Australian football represents the epicenter of sports culture, and Melbourne hosts a sports culture that is quite unlike anywhere else’s.
Throughout the year, Melbourne hosts Australia’s main sporting events including the Melbourne Cup Carnival, the Australian Open tennis tournament, International Sailing Federation Sailing World Cup and the Formula 1 Grand Prix. The biggest influence on the city, however, is the Australian Football League.
Australian football is a contact sport where two teams of 18 players, who each wear minimal protection, attempt to advance an oval-shaped ball across the cricket-like field. The rules are quite intricate, as players are allowed to move the ball along the field with any body part but have to perform a “running bounce” every 15 meters. Players can also run while holding the ball, as long as they complete the running bounces and refrain from throwing the ball. Additionally, players can handball to move the ball along, provided that the movement does not resemble a volleyball serve. If a player catches a kicked ball that travels over 15 meters, it is considered a mark; marks are rewarded with free kicks. The objective is to kick the ball through the opposing team’s goal.
AFL’s dominance in Melbourne life is found in the leagues formed throughout the cities and  suburbs. The loyalty runs deep as fans rush the stadiums on the weekends decked out in their colors. Home town, though, is not the main determinant of loyalty. Many fans do not necessarily support the team from where they live; rather, family ties guide fanbases, as the sport is experienced through the bond shared by families.
The loyalty demonstrated by Melbourne fans reminds me of a school tradition that I sidelined myself this semester — USC football. Checking the score online and living vicariously through streams of photos on Instagram and Facebook, I remember those great moments of Trojan pride experienced during the season. I find myself sometimes humming the tune of “Fight On!” while walking around in Melbourne on Sundays, as the 17-hour time difference really throws off the gameday viewing.
I have tried to explain tailgating, sometimes with limited success, to those who have never lived the experience. Limited parallels exist with how tailgating presents itself on campus and leading to the Coliseum. In Australia, the fans are definitely less rowdy and chaotic. Teams serve as a uniting factor for fans, epitomized by AFL gamedays, but the Trojan Family runs deeper than shared pride for a team.
At the University of Melbourne, sports do not play such a large role as they do at USC. The lacking influence of athletics narrows the experience here to one focused primarily on academics. Brilliant navy-colored University of Melbourne seals sporadically cover the grounds, but not to the extent spirit pervades USC. University spirit is a distinctly American trait and is expressly present at USC.
AFL also provides people, especially those living in Melbourne, with uniting factors for family and weekend traditions. Along with football, several other sports are also popular. The Australian Open encourages tennis buzz. Despite taking a backseat to AFL, both soccer and rugby are sports played in this country. Cricket also has a presence in the sporting world. Because Australia is surrounded by water, surfing competitions are extremely popular, especially in the Gold Coast.
The consumer culture surrounding Australian sporting events greatly diverges from the United States. While the Super Bowl has become a spectacle for competing advertisements, the AFL Grand Final has no advertisements throughout the game. The game plays continuously, only stopping briefly for halftime when potentially a couple of ads are run on television. Instead, corporatism appears on the jerseys, as players boast their sponsors on their chests.
Sports like horse racing do not gain much traction until the main event approaches, similar to sports played during the Olympics. The events though, especially the Melbourne Cup, are truly distinctive and reflective of the whole city as sports take on a new form. The Melbourne Cup provides an important fashion event for the city as spectators dress in elegant day dresses with eccentric hats and suits with a required tie.
Aussies are active in the sporting world. Footy is a staple in the Aussie diet, and sporting events are an experience. I have been lucky to  get a taste for how sports are experienced here, even if I miss the Trojan spirit.

Having an accent, no matter where it’s from, is nothing to be ashamed of. Markel Eguiluz | Daily Trojan
Yes, I do have an accent — and yes, I am proud of it. However, it has not always been that way. When I came to Los Angeles back in August, I felt out of place with my accent. I was at a new university, in a new city and a new country and did not know anyone. Whenever I started talking to somebody, the magic question was always asked, “Oh, so where are you from?” I could see that “you have an accent” look in their eyes.
I do not mean to say that locals are rude .Most of them are very nice in fact. However, being foreign, you always have the feeling of being some kind of black sheep. No matter how much USC gear you wear, or how many football games you attend to, you will always be slightly “different.”
But being different is not the actual problem. Thinking that being different is a problem is the real issue. That is why I am now proud of my accent. The reason why I have it is that I come from Spain, and English is not my mother tongue. There are loads of things that are different between Spain and the United States: food, timetables, parties. Language is only one difference, and definitely not the most important.
What is important is that having an accent means that I can speak in a language that is not my mother tongue. Having an accent means that I am able to explain my thoughts in a way native English speakers can understand them, even if we come from different countries. Perhaps others do not care about my thoughts — It’s true I might not have the most exciting things to say in slightly broken English — but at least they have the chance to hear them.
We cannot ignore that languages do set barriers. Some of them might be irrelevant, like missing a couple of jokes while watching a movie, or having to use Google Translator many times in order to understand an article. However, what about personal relationships? They are clearly not the same when you are not a native speaker. You may have a short talk and make a couple of jokes with anybody, but it is much more difficult to reach an intimate point. You are hardly going to captivate that cute girl from your class if she has to repeat every word she says, or if you are the one to repeat everything because of your weird pronunciation.
Nevertheless, a language is one of the most powerful things you can learn. If you are visiting a new country, for example, knowing the local tongue will make your experience totally different. That is precisely the biggest advantage of being able to speak another language: it is the best way to facilitate cultural exchange.
Mixing cultures is very significant, even if we are not very aware of it. Getting people from around the world to speak, think and work together has impressive results. You may have heard about globalization. Well, that is just a high-scale cultural mix.
I know, that foreign guy looks strange at first.
“Look at his clothes, food, hair!” you might think.
However, there might be a very interesting and enriching explanation behind that things you find “strange.”
There are still people who think that having an accent means someone is stupid (hello, Mr. Trump). However, my advice is to look at (or hear) every accent you notice as an opportunity to learn something new. I have already been putting this into practice since my exchange program at USC began. So far, it is has been great.

Despite hours of making travel plans, when it comes to the actual trip, it’s possible that nothing goes as planned. Maya Anderman | Daily Trojan
When you travel it’s nearly impossible not to have a few occasional bumps along the road. You spend hours making concrete plans only to have them completely turned around, sometimes within minutes of leaving for your destination. I always find it a bit ironic that people put so much time and energy into planning their trips because, in the end, nothing ever goes according to plan. During my semester abroad thus far, a lot of students have talked about how irrelevant planning can end up being, but I didn’t truly encounter it until this past weekend when my roommate and I took a trip to Belgium.
First off, when planning our trip we naively decided to book a train out of London at 8 a,m.. 
“8 a.m. isn’t that early!” I thought to myself — if only I had known. We booked this trip as a celebration of my roommate’s 21st birthday and seeing as this was her 21st on the eve of her birthday (as well as the eve of our 8 a.m. departure) we decided to go out for a bit to celebrate the next year of her life. Our aim of a quick outing failed, and, before we knew it, it was 6 a.m., neither of us had gone to bed, and it was time to head to the train station. Both completely delirious from lack of sleep, we somehow made it to our train, and before we knew it we had arrived in Belgium.
Having spent the entire night awake and arriving in Brussels feeling quite rundown, we were looking forward to heading to our place of residence to freshen up (and maybe catch a snooze) so we could go explore the town. However, because traveling never goes according to plan, it ended up being that the host of the AirBnB room we had booked could not let us in until around 7 p.m. This resulted in two very tired roommates lugging their bags around Brussels for a solid eight hours. It was certainly not one of my proudest moments.
When I pictured myself studying abroad in Europe, I imagined a much more glamorous version of myself traipsing through the cobblestone streets — not lethargically dragging around my belongings in sweat pants with my eyes barely open. We tried to fill the time with some sightseeing and waffles, but by 5 p.m. pure exhaustion had hit and all forms of electronic devices had died. We figured phones were kind of essential so we headed to a Marriot hotel where we charged up and with absolutely no remorse, ended up sleeping on the couches in the lobby for about two hours (while receiving very concerned looks from hotel concierge and guests).
We eventually made it to our room and were able to change and finish our eventful and humorous day with a traditional Belgian dinner. Besides our unconventional start, the rest of our trip went as expected. We walked through the Grand Place, explored different chocolatiers and made it a mission to eat nine waffles each (we pitifully made it to only six total). Our sleep deprivation struggles seemed like something of the past.
However, we weren’t completely off the travel mishap hook. When we left Brussels to go to Bruges, we again ended up dragging our luggage from the train station, this time for about five or six miles, before we reached our destination with phones at a frighteningly low 5 percent battery, but hey at least we had slept.
As a cherry on top of the weekend, as we were leaving Belgium I arrived at the U.K. border control only to realize I had forgotten my USC immigration letter in London. This resulted in a long session of being grilled with questions by a not so friendly British patrol officer, as well as almost missing our train back to London.
At the time these unforeseen circumstances seemed much worse than they really were. Sometimes when you’re traveling it seems like all odds are against you and everything that could possibly go wrong does. In reality, these kinds of things happen to everyone. Traveling would not be what it is if these types of mishaps didn’t occur. In the end they are usually something you can look back and laugh on, and will always last as great memories.
