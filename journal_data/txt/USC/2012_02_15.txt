The USC men’s golf team, No. 4 in the nation and coming off back-to-back top-two tournament finishes, made it three in a row with another strong performance, finishing second in the final day of play at the San Diego Intercollegiate Tournament. The tournament, held at the San Diego Country Club in Chula Vista, Calif., featured 15 teams, with Washington capturing first place.

The Trojans finished at 13-over par, seven strokes behind Washington, which came in at 6-over par. The competition featured a third place finish by rival UCLA (20-over  par) and a tie for fourth place between San Diego State and Tennessee (23-over par).
The team received solid play from senior Steve Lim and junior Martin Trainer, both of whom finished tied for third at even-216. Sophomore Jeffrey Kang, coming off his first tournament victory, notched his third straight top-eight finish, ending tied for eighth at three-over 219, including an impressive four birdies and even finishes on the front and back nine.
Junior Sam Smith also finished tied for eighth at 3-over par, rebounding from a four-over par through four holes to remain even for the rest of the round. Freshman Anthony Paolucci finished at 13-over par, tied for 40th, while sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun came in at 48th with an overall score of 15-over par.
The first day of play saw the Trojans collect a score of 288, four strokes behind the Huskies. Lim fired an even-72, while Kang recorded five birdies to finish even as well. Trainer, the 2011 Pac-10 champion, shot a two-under par without a bogey. Sahyoun came in at two-over par, while Paolucci struggled to a 4-over 76.
The Trojans struggled individually during the second day of play, finishing with a score of 299. Only Lim finished under par, firing a 1-under par to cap a solid two-round performance. Kang followed an up-and-down first round with a three-over par, while Paolucci concluded at four-over par. Trainer found it difficult to maintain his performance from the first round, finishing five-over par, while Sahyoun came in tied for 38th at 9-over par.
The Trojans regrouped considerably in the third round, riding impressive back nine performances from Kang and Trainer to finish second. Trainer finished off in style, notching four consecutive birdies in the final round to finish 3-under par.
Kang also recorded four birdies, finishing even at par. Lim came in at one-over par, while Sahyoun finished at four-over par and Paolucci ended tied for 40th with a five-over par in the final round. The top-two finish marked the third such standing in a row for the Trojans, who won their final fall event before also taking second at the annual Amer Ari event in Waikoloa Beach, Hawaii, earlier in the month.
Following this, the Trojans will have two weeks off before participating in the Del Walker Match Play, an all-day tournament to be held at the Virginia Country Club in Long Beach, Calif., from Feb. 27-28.

When USC and UCLA meet in any sport, there tends to be a lot on the line. There might be a conference title at stake. Other times, postseason hopes are at stake. Ultimately, the rivalry is always for city bragging rights, regardless of record or standing.
But this year, neither team has a whole lot to brag about. The Trojans have six wins and are last in the Pac-12. Meanwhile, the Bruins, who began the season in the top 25, have stumbled to a 15-11 record. Unless either team makes an incredible run and somehow wins the conference tournament, these teams will be left home on Selection Sunday when March Madness comes around.
So when the Trojans and the Bruins battled at the Sports Arena Wednesday night, it hardly seemed like a game that would inspire much emotion. One year of subpar basketball, however, should not turn fans away from the crosstown rivalry. Many forget that this rivalry has seen its share of great moments.
Though football memories tend to dominate, such as O.J. Simpson running through the entire UCLA defense in the 1960s, the hardwood has given us plenty of reasons to keep an eye on the USC-UCLA rivalry after the fall season ends:
—
Beginning in 1932, USC beat the Bruins for 11 straight years. Famous UCLA coach John Wooden beat the Trojans 61 times during his time in Westwood. The overall record in the rivalry? UCLA leads, but not by as much as you might think: 130-104.
In 1970, the Trojans were the top-ranked team in the country. UCLA, though, beat USC twice in the season, which were USC’s only losses of the season. UCLA won the conference, and the Trojans, despite a 24-2 record, were left out of the NCAA Tournament.
—
Lew Alcindor — later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — and the UCLA team beat the Trojans in double overtime in 1968. In that season, Alcindor averaged 26.2 points and 16.5 rebounds per game.
—
In 1985, the Trojans and Bruins played at the Sports Arena with the conference title on the line. The Trojans came out victorious in quadruple overtime. That season, the Trojans went to the NCAA tournament but the Bruins did not.
—
Let’s not forget the stars who have played in this rivalry. For UCLA, you have centers Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton, guard Marques Johnson, forward Sidney Wicks, guard Arron Afflalo, forward Kevin Love, guards Walt Hazzard and Reggie Miller, among many others. The Trojans have a pretty solid list too, including guard DeMar DeRozen, forward Taj Gibson, guard O.J. Mayo, guard Paul Westphal and guard Nick Young.
—
The latest memorable game against the two schools took place in 2008, when Mayo and Love led the Trojans and the Bruins, respectively. The teams met for a rare third time in the Pac-10 tournament. The Bruins won the game by three points with Love, the first team All-American and future fifth overall draft pick. Mayo, meanwhile, went third overall in the same draft.
Sure, the games haven’t received the hype that surrounds football games, mainly because USC has never won a national title in basketball. There have been, however, great moments and great players that have played in this rivalry. Maybe it’s not North Carolina vs. Duke, but it’s as heated as it gets when the Trojans and Bruins play.
Many of these players know each other from Amateur Athletic Union ball and high school. The relationships between players can go back years, and that makes games such as those that we saw last night even better.
There might not be much at stake for these players in terms of wins and losses in this latest edition of the series, but pride is something equally as important that the Bruins and Trojans always play for, whether the fans acknowledge it or not.
Whether it’s Lew Alcindor or Lazeric Jones for UCLA or Brian Scalebrine or Maurice Jones suiting up for the Trojans, we as fans need to bask in this rivalry, whether or not both teams are relevant on the national stage. We have had incredible moments, and who knows, maybe last night’s game provided something fans will remember for a lifetime. Only time will tell.

The No. 6 USC men’s volleyball team is hosting the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics No. 7  Hope International Thursday at the Galen Center. The Trojans swept Pepperdine last week and have another week after the Hope International match to prepare for a tough road trip against Pacific and Stanford.
Spiked · Senior middle blocker Steven Shandrick has led the Trojans to a 7-5 record. He was a second team all-conference selection in 2011. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“We need to carry the momentum over from the Pepperdine match,” junior opposite Maddison McKibbin said. “It’s easy to play down and we need to keep playing well to build off of last game and to prepare for next week at Stanford.”
The sweep against Pepperdine vaulted the Trojans to No. 5 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. The victory spelled out a two-match swing against the similarly ranked Waves, victories that will pay off toward the end of the season.
“That’s a big deal in conference standings,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “The top four of the MPSF is established and both us and Pepperdine have a lot of upside. Both us and Pepperdine will be better, and the win on the front end could be big down the stretch for us.”
The Hope International match will be used to ramp up intensity in the practice gym and to build depth to prepare for the upcoming stretch of conference play.
Players without much playing experience, such as opposite hitter Joey Booth, middle blocker Chris Lischke and libero JB Green, are looking to use the extra practice time and court time to prove themselves as contributors for the tough stretch of the season. McKibbin played in his first match this season against Pepperdine, and he is looking to get back into a groove after missing the first portion of the season with an ankle injury.
“We’re looking to play a couple different guys but not a whole second unit,” Ferguson said. “With a nonconference game right before the big stretch of conference play, we have to look at a couple of different guys.”
Though Hope International does not hail from a power conference like the MPSF or the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, good play in the match is crucial.
“We’re definitely not underestimating them, especially because they went to five [sets]  with a good UC San Diego team,” Ferguson said. “We need to maintain intensity and focus in practice. Sometimes there’s an overall sense that we can exhale, but we can’t. You can never feel that way and especially not when there’s a tough stretch of the season coming up.”

The USC men’s basketball team was unable to put an end to its four game losing streak on Wednesday night, falling to the UCLA Bruins (15-11, 8-6) by a score of 64-54. The Trojans (6-21, 1-13) dropped their fifth straight game and are just 1-14 in their past 15 contests.

USC returned to its former homecourt, the Los Angeles Sports Arena, for the first time since 2006 to face off against its crosstown rivals. UCLA is making repairs to the Pauley Pavilion and has been using the arena as its venue for the season.
“That’s a good team there,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said of the Bruins. “They were picked 12th nationally and to win our league. I think you have to take into consideration that they haven’t played a home game all year. These guys have been forced to play at a neutral site every single game.”
The Bruins jumped out to an early advantage over the Trojans, starting the game on a 10-2 run. USC struggled shooting the ball in the first half, finishing 7-29 (24 percent) compared to UCLA’s 14-27 (52 percent). They trailed going into the break, 31-16.
“It comes down to shot-making with us,” O’Neill said. “We didn’t make any shots in the first half and shot 39 percent for the game.”
USC outscored the Bruins in the second half by a five-point margin — 38-33 — but couldn’t fully recover from an early deficit. Still, the Trojans managed to avoid another blowout at the hands of UCLA, as was the case on Jan. 15 in a 66-47 loss.
“We approach every game the same, we just took a different type of initiative to not fold and to keep fighting,” sophomore guard Maurice Jones said.
Freshman guard Byron Wesley led the Trojans with 16 points and seven rebounds, shooting 5-11 from the floor and 6-10 from the free throw line. He earned high praise from O’Neill for his performance.
“I think he’s becoming a really legit [player],” O’Neill said. ‘We want him to be aggressive to the basket.”
Also joining Wesley in double figures was sophomore forward Garrett Jackson, who added 15 points, four steals and three blocks.
The Bruins, meanwhile, were paced by twin forwards David and Travis Wear, who contributed a combined 30 points and 24 rebounds.
“They’re really, really good players,” O’Neill said. “They’re only redshirt sophomores, they’ve both got two years left to play … Their frontline is as good as anyone’s in the country other than North Carolina probably.”
The Trojans will get their longest break of the season —eight days — before traveling to Arizona to take on the Wildcats (18-8, 9-4) on Feb. 23.
The Wildcats have won four straight games, including road victories against Stanford and the Pac-12 leading California.
In their first meeting on Jan. 8, USC fell to Arizona at the Galen Center by a score of 57-46. USC has four games remaining this season before the Pac-12 tournament.
“Just getting some rest is going to help,” Jones said. “We only play about six, seven guys playing 20-30 minutes apiece. That’s the most important thing as we try to get these last four games.”

USC must ban all smoking 
Though California boasts the second lowest rate of adult smokers in the nation and many American college campuses have banned smoking, USC is still bafflingly hesitant to issue an anti-smoking policy.
USC should ban smoking on campus because it is unfair for non-smokers, who are the majority, to involuntarily breathe in the toxins that permeate our shared air supply.
Second-hand smoke is responsible for more than 49,000 deaths per year. Though smokers blatantly disregard the well-being of those around them, they also lack common courtesy. Smoking on campus is inconsiderate because many non-smokers in the area find the smell of smoke unappealing. It can give people headaches, irritate their eyes, soil their clothing and hair and ruin the pleasant meals they’re trying to enjoy outdoors.
Those who still wish to purchase and enjoy cigarettes would certainly be welcome to do so off campus. Though I acknowledge that such a policy change would be a slight inconvenience for current smokers, there are plenty of exits around the perimeter of campus that smokers can easily walk to if they want to smoke.
A smoking ban on campus would be a small change for smokers to make with a magnanimous, beneficial impact on campus life in general, bettering our campus’ air quality, our community’s health — for both smokers and non-smokers — and our school’s image.
Most businesses and restaurants in California have already banned smoking in and around their workplaces, and Los Angeles, in particular, has notoriously bad air supply problems. So why should USC contribute to the problem? Since the actions of individual USC students represent the entire student body and university name, as a community we should be more conscious about the reputation we uphold, as well as the toxins we are emitting.
Lindsey Smith
Senior, communication 
USC must ban on cell phone use. It is unfair to force others to involuntarily be subjected to cell phone radiation. Most expensive restaurants have already banned cell phone usage in their dining areas – why is USC so bafflingly hesitant to issue this policy?
I don’t smoke and find it highly unpleasant when others do so in my presence. In fact, I asked my roommates last year not to smoke cigars with the front door open as it stunk up the house and my clothes. However, its a whole new field when you ask the state or university to ban it altogether. I too find this fascist and do not appreciate the government or university telling me how to make personal decisions in my life. 
Tell me, do you also want to ban high-calorie foods because they cause heart disease? How about high-emissions vehicles because of the pollution they cause and their unpleasant nature? How about the government just tells us what job is best for us, who we can marry, where we can go to college and whether or not we should have kids?
As the first two comments pointed out, this article is laughable.  Does the author have any understanding of basic science?  To say that smoking contributes to the overall Los Angeles air quality problem is straight up not true.  Smoking outside in a completely unenclosed area does not have a measurable effect on the health of others.
Some people don’t like the smell of smoke?  Neither do I, but that doesn’t mean I try to go around limiting the rights of individuals.  There are no problems with the designated smoking areas that currently exist.
This letter is so demanding, so facist. USC must do this! USC must do that! Everyone should march in step with other schools! Why would you want to turn USC into Storm Trooper University?
So people smoke, big deal. Some people wear too much perfume. Some people spend too much time in the tanning bed. Some people eat too many twinkies. Some people spend to much time on Facebook. We shouldn’t outlaw all of those things, but let people have their journey and figure out what works for them. That is what college should be about, figuring out what works for you in a free environment. 
And if you are worried about emitting toxins, put a sheet of fabric softener in your britches.
Second-hand smoke in an unenclosed space has no implications on health. Los Angeles’ air quality is not impacted by smokers, and certainly not by the few present on USC’s campus. Aren’t actual facts amazing?
On an unrelated note, this sentence is not English:
A smoking ban on campus would be a small change for smokers to make with a magnanimous, beneficial impact on campus life in general, bettering our campus’ air quality, our community’s health — for both smokers and non-smokers — and our school’s image.
I would hope that a student studying communication would be capable of conveying her ideas clearly. That is not the case here. There is also a blatant lack of copy-editing.

Facebook has much of the world in the palm of its hand. The website had more than 845 million active users at the end of 2011, and more than half of its users logged on daily.
We’ve all heard the argument that Facebook helps keep friends and family in touch. But this argument seems inconsistent.
Are many of the things posted on Facebook necessary? Photos of lunch, new shoes and new outfits? Overused philosophical quotes and song lyrics? I’ve seen it go as far as a soon-to-be mother creating a profile for her unborn child and recommending friends to befriend the fetus.
Other times, it seems as if Facebook is just a tool for checking up on others. I often witness jealousy and curiosity taking hold of people: “Why did he comment on her photo?” or “I can’t believe she’s still talking to him.”
Keeping in touch? No. The online forum resembles more of a beauty pageant, bringing together hundreds of so-called friends who seek approval from each other for places they check in to, photos they post and statuses they update. The more, the better.
The problem lies in the essence of Facebook: It presents a false numerical value of your worth to others and becomes a breeding ground for narcissism. People place unreasonably high importance on something as insignificant as a “thumbs up” button or how many wall posts you get on your birthday. It keeps users from easily walking away.
It gets worse. It gets serious.
In Iowa, a woman burned down the garage of an ex-friend who de-friended her; in Texas, a husband drunkenly beat his wife for her failure to comment on a status update; in New York, a 14-year-old committed suicide after months of bullying over Facebook.
One story from earlier this month is particularly bizarre. After a teenage girl complained about her father on Facebook, he ended the social life of his malcontent daughter by shooting her laptop nine times — eight times for himself and one time for his wife. To add insult to injury, he videotaped the entire ordeal and placed it on his own profile. The video then went viral, racking up more than 26 million views and giving his daughter a lesson she will surely never forget.
Late last week, Marvin Enoch Potter, 60, and his friend Jamie Lynn Curd, 38, murdered Billie Jean Hayworth and Billy Clay Payne in their home. Their motivation? Hayworth deleted Potter’s adult daughter, Jenelle Potter, from her Facebook friends list.
If you need any other reason to use Facebook more responsibly, a simple search reveals hundreds of similar articles, journals, studies and surveys — all ready to be read, liked and recommended.
Facebook users should use the public forum for its positive aspects: networking, keeping in touch, raising awareness and planning events. Don’t plague the population with pointless information, threats and bullying. Use Facebook for its intended purpose and don’t take what you see on your newsfeed so seriously; you might end up preventing a few casualties.

Traditionally, the Daily Trojan endorses a presidential ticket in the Undergraduate Student Government’s elections.
This year, however, the editors of the Daily Trojan have opted not to endorse any of the candidates.
Though an endorsement is only a recommendation, the hyper-local environment of a university makes an endorsement for student government elections more influential than an endorsement for the United States presidential seat.
Relationships among student organizations and among members within those organizations are inevitable. Hence, endorsements can unintentionally exhibit bias because of personal relationships with candidates.
The responsibility of this newspaper is to provide objective news coverage. But it is the responsibility of the reader to decide which candidates are best suited to take up the roles of two of the top student leader positions on campus.
An endorsement from the Daily Trojan would only undermine students’ abilities to judge for themselves the best candidates to lead the undergraduate student population.
With a print circulation of 10,000, the Daily Trojan is an easily accessible resource for people interested in USC news. And after 100 years as USC’s student newspaper, readers rely on the Daily Trojan to provide fair news coverage.
Choosing not to endorse a presidential ticket is an indication on behalf of the editorial board that it has made a conscious effort not to influence voters toward voting for one pair of candidates over another.
The editors of the Daily Trojan encourage all undergraduates to research the candidates and cast an informed vote.
Voting ends Thursday. To cast a paper ballot, visit booths alongside Trousdale Parkway, or vote online at elections.usc.edu.
 
Staff editorials are determined by the senior editorial board. Its members include Maya Itah, Melissa Caskey, Sean Fitz-Gerald and Giovanni Osorio.
What a cowardly way out.
I think this is a good idea.   The readership of the Daily Trojan is smaller than the LA times, SF Chronicle, NY Times, and therefore the endorsement of a candidate would lead to an unfair election.  The Daily Trojan is also the only publication which can endorse a candidate.  There are no other student newspapers at USC, so there could be no competition from another candidate through the same means of newspaper media.  
Students should be able to do their research and vote for the candidate they choose.  Notice Daily Trojan didn’t say they wouldn’t provide any candidate coverage, simply that they would not choose a side.  This helps the election go more based on campaigns than based on who has friends at the student paper.
Plenty of other reputable news sources: LA Times, SF Chronicle, NY Times, WSJ, etc. endorse candidates for different races. It doesn’t mean that those newspapers assume that individuals can’t make the decision to vote for someone because of their own research. As much as I would likely never vote for the candidate the DT endorses because of its liberal slant, its important to hold yourself to the high standard these other major papers do and endorse a candidate.
So… The Daily Trojan is saying it’s neither informed nor unbiased enough to lend its opinion on this matter. In the opinion pages. That’s heartening.

It’s that time of year when colorful campaign signs decorate Trousdale Parkway’s lawns, signaling the arrival of Undergraduate Student Government elections.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Over the last two weeks, candidates for president, vice president and senator positions have vigorously competed for student votes through mass emails, public debates, social media, word of mouth, sleek websites and sophisticated videos.
For students who are involved with USG, personally acquainted with the candidates or actively involved on campus, it’s an exciting and eventful time.
But what about everyone else? Past voting records show that approximately 70 percent of undergraduate students don’t vote in USG elections.
Although the 5,629 total ballots cast last year represented an impressive 23 percent increase over the previous year, it’s still a fraction of the 17,500 students that comprise USC’s undergraduate student body. That’s a huge, untapped population opting for indifference.
Simply put, more students need to vote.
Let’s consider why USG’s leadership should matter to students in the first place.
The reality is that USC administrators simply can’t listen to all 17,500 undergraduate voices at once. USG serves as the liaison between students and the administration, where each director has direct contact with senior level administrators.
“The student body president and vice president are the images of the student body most visible to senior level administration,” said Elise Fabbro, director of elections and recruitment at USG. “In short, USG has the tools to make change happen in the university, and all they are doing is waiting for you to tell them what you want.”
Some students feel that if they don’t know the candidates personally, they have no real reason to back a certain person.
If students are passionate about seeing improvements on campus, however, it’s likely that one of the tickets supports their interests. Current candidates are taking on a wide variety of issues. Jared Ginsburg and Samantha Coxe are advocating for fall break; Theo Offei and Julia Riley are pushing for two-unit grad school exam prep classes; Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad are aiming to improve the quality of residential dining facilities.
Moreover, students who are wary of candidates making false promises should be aware that many past USG leaders have followed through on their original platform points.
Improving sustainability, increasing hours of hospitality venues at the campus center and adding a fall break were among the key platform points for current USG President Monish Tyagi and Vice President Logan Lachman. In the past year, USG has extended the hours of operation at Seeds Marketplace from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., tackled campus bicycle traffic and passed a resolution on fall break.
“You want to choose people who you think will have your best interests at heart, who will represent student interests and go to bat with them,” Tyagi said. “While [USG officers] don’t directly make changes, they will be the people who are suggesting changes.”
It’s also important to keep in mind that USG will set the ball in motion on policies that are implemented further down the road. Students who transferred their football game credits to friends without season tickets can trace the option back to Holden Slusher and Ashlie Chan’s administration in 2009. Similarly, next year’s president and vice president will pick up where Tyagi and Lachman left off on instituting a fall break.
If students are still not convinced, the 2011-2012 USG budget is $1.8 million. $57.50 of every student’s semester fees automatically goes toward USG. If all students were cognizant of that fact, they would care more about giving their dollars to student leaders whose vision for USC aligns with their own.
Our generation is often accused of being apathetic. But even if you can’t attend a political event or a midterm election, effecting change right here on campus is simple.
Let’s continue the trend of higher student turnout at elections and exceed USG’s new goal of 7,000 votes this year. Take the time to cast a vote online or at an on-campus voting booth and have a say in making changes that will impact USC both now and after graduation.

When people think of comic books, they tend to think of superheroes. It’s not surprising; the superhero genre originated in comic books. It was the dominant genre after censorship in the 1950s restricted the industry, and now the phrase “comic book movie” is used synonymously with “superhero movie.”
But comics are about more than this one-dimensional association. Like television and cinema, they’re a host to every genre, and as the independent comic market has grown and creators have become more prominent in recent years, writers and artists are bringing a greater diversity of comics to readers.
Here are some titles from the last decade from a number of different genres — free of superheroes.
 
For fans of suspense thrillers, film noir, Dracula, Indiana Jones:
Rex Mundi
Stories about religious conspiracy are a dime a dozen in the post-Da Vinci Code world, but this series debuted before Dan Brown’s bestselling — but lackluster —thriller set in 1930s Paris where the Protestant Reformation never happened. Rex Mundi is a murder mystery about the Holy Grail.
Masked inquisitors roam the Gothic streets while the hero gets caught up in chases through hidden temples, a treasure hunt and political intrigue threatening to launch a world war.
Forgoing story arcs in favor of one continuous narrative, writer Arvid Nelson gives his characters more development than thriller heroes usually receive. But Juan Ferreyra’s art — a mix of chiaroscuro fueled noir and art noveau characters — brings the pages to life, showing why Rex Mundi functions as a comic and not as a work of prose.
 
For fans of Black Hawk Down, Battlestar Galactica:
DMZ
Insurgency. Disenfranchisement. Urban decay. Life during wartime. These are topics constantly in the news about places like Iraq or Afghanistan, but what if similar things were happening in the United States?
Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli’s comic, DMZ, envisions a second American Civil War, with the front line at New York City, where Manhattan has been turned into the de-militarized zone. For the inhabitants trapped there, it’s a game of survival.
On a broader level, DMZ is a compelling look at issues that have become buzzwords in the American media. By setting the conflict inside the United States, Wood forces readers to place themselves in the shoes of Manhattanites.
In terms of story, DMZ is an exciting mix of urban slice of life moments — such as a graffiti artist dodging militias to work on his masterpiece — and the battle-filled conflict for control, as journalist Matty Roth and his circle of friends get drawn into the war and Manhattan’s rise as a sovereign power. Throw in Burchielli’s street art-influenced panels and Wood’s deep knowledge of New York culture and DMZ is one of the best comics of the modern era.
 
For fans of video games, romance, kung-fu films:
Scott Pilgrim
Scott Pilgrim is a modern take on the classic boy meets girl plot. It’s just that this time, boy meets girl and has to fight her seven evil exes. Bryan Lee O’Malley’s six volumes are an incredibly inventive mix of video game displays, leveling up, sweet romance and music.
It’s hard to nail down Scott Pilgrim’s genre because it encompasses so many elements and switches between them as quickly as one panel. This is a comic where Scott’s best friend Wallace can defend the virtues of bacon while offering romantic advice, and another character can be described as “part-ninja.” Despite all of the action and shout-outs, the focus is on the relationship between Scott and his love interest Ramona Flowers.
The film adaptation came out Aug. 13, 2010 and captured the story and aesthetic perfectly. But there are more subplots, absurdity, crazy action scenes and hijinks in the comics.
 
For fans of noir, The Town, Reservoir Dogs, Point Blank:
Criminal
With Criminal, Ed Brubaker proves he’s the king of crime comics. This isn’t the Ocean’s Eleven type of crime where charming, flashy characters pull off a caper. Instead, it’s a look into the criminal mindset and how emotions like greed or hate can derail even the perfect crime.
The protagonists range from brilliant but cowardly thieves to violent AWOL soldiers. Yet things never feel cliché. For every double cross, murder or heist, it’s dark, but that darkness is appropriate.
Criminal’s artist Sean Phillips is a genius of the genre. His covers take on a more painted feel that evoke the covers of pulp magazines from days past. With the interiors, there’s a stark realism in his linework. Like the characters scheming in the pages, Phillips’ art is there to do the job in an upfront, professional manner.
It’s been said that Martin Scorsese’s movies are a cornerstone of crime fiction. Criminal does for comics what Scorsese does for film.
 
Nicholas Slayton is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism. His column “Panel to Panel” runs Thursdays.
This paragraph is confusing to me Nick- “Stories about religious conspiracy are a dime a dozen in the post-Da Vinci Code world, but this series debuted before Dan Brown’s bestselling — but lackluster —thriller set in 1930s Paris where the Protestant Reformation never happened. Rex Mundi is a murder mystery about the Holy Grail.” Are you saying Dan Brown’s book is set in the 1930s? Are you missing some punctuation?

The Great Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942
Fort MacArthur Museum
Saturday, Feb. 18, 3-8 p.m.
The Battle of Los Angeles — not to be confused with the awful 2011 film Battle: Los Angeles — took place on the night of Feb. 24, 1942. For reasons still not totally clear today, U.S. military forces stationed in Los Angeles suddenly ordered a county-wide blackout and opened anti-aircraft fire into the night sky. Attributed to a false alarm based on reports of unidentified objects in the sky, the L.A. air raid resulted in more than 1,400 shells being fired and three civilian deaths from friendly fire.
The Fort MacArthur Museum is recreating the event on the museum grounds, complete with period-era tanks, weapons, uniformed officers and a re-enactment of the shelling. There will also be dancing and music, courtesy of Dean Mora and the Fort MacArthur Officer’s Orchestra. The event is a once-a-year opportunity, so don’t miss out. Tickets are $20 in advance and $30 at the door.
 
The Darkness
House of Blues — Sunset Strip
Sunday, Feb. 19 at 8 p.m.
It’s been a while since retro British glam-rock band The Darkness has been in the limelight. After hitting it huge with “I Believe In A Thing Called Love,” off its 2003 debut album Permission to Land, the band seemed to sink under the dark waves of mediocrity. The decline was fueled in part by a lackluster follow-up — 2005’s One Way Ticket to Hell… And Back — as well as internal problems, notably the departures of bassist Frankie Poullain and, shortly after, frontman Justin Hawkins, who ended up in rehab.
But now they’re back, reunited and ready to rock. Though The Darkness’ brand of dramatic, glammed-up rock might be a little — or to some, very — unfashionable these days, these Brits have always been noted for their ridiculously entertaining live performances.
So prepare to rock out this Sunday, but remember: Don’t forget the Aqua Net and leather pants.

For North Memphis’ Manassas High School football team, failure was an expectation going into each season. For more than a century, the team hasn’t won a single playoff game. The program was underfunded and the players were considered undisciplined, unsportsmanlike and defeatist.
Coming of Age · Undefeated doesn’t just cater to athletes or enthusiastic sports fans. Sentimental concepts of lofty dreams and the accompanying potential for failure stretches across all boundaries. - Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
Dan Lindsay, T.J. Martin, Rich Middlemas and Glen Zipper came to USC to screen and discuss their Oscar-nominated documentary, Undefeated, on the North Memphis football program.
One morning three years ago, Middlemas and Lindsay were having breakfast in Santa Monica when they decided that they, like many documentary filmmakers, were sick of waiting for a great story to fall into their laps.
A few weeks later, Undefeated directors Martin and Lindsay came across the story of O.C. Brown, a Manassas High School football player who spent his weekdays living with coach Bill Courtney and his family to receive tutoring help.
Brown entered his senior year of high school facing pressure to impress college recruiters and bring his grades up to stay eligible for a Division I football scholarship. Lindsay and Martin were taken by Brown’s moving story.
“At the end of the day, it’s a coming of age film, but in O.C.’s case it would be something intimate to see him come of age on the big stage while he’s being courted by all of these different colleges and the idea of what is possible,” Martin said.
As is the nature of documentary filmmaking, once shooting began, the story’s scope began to expand beyond Brown’s story into the story of the Tigers’ journey to defy tradition and finally win a playoff game.
The documentary follows several players on the team and coach Courtney, a small business owner who volunteers his time to help rebuild the neglected team. As he leads the fortuneless program, Courtney deals with the on- and off-the-field issues concerning the young, underprivileged team.
For years, the Tigers were financially dependent on booking games against wealthy schools that outmatched Manassas in embarrassing losses. The players would take these humiliating losses with their heads down and expect another disappointing season for the team.
It took a coach like Courtney to recruit promising players and convince them that this was a Manassas team with the potential to do something unexpected. Undefeated tells the story of an underdog team, but it goes far beyond the events on the field, and the stars of the film aren’t the usual glamorized football stars.
“This is a football movie; the people who are scoring touchdowns probably are important, but that never even crossed our minds because we were worried more about the narrative and the character journey and the football was just the backdrop,” Lindsay said. “There was a team story there and they would represent the team.”
It didn’t take long for them to find Montrail ‘Money’ Brown, another one of the film’s captivating characters.
“We met Money on our first trip there,” Lindsay said. “It was really interesting because here was this guy who seemed to be doing everything right, but didn’t seem to have the same support system built around him purely out of the fact that he was not going to be able garner a Division I football scholarship.”
Lindsay and Martin as well as the film’s producer, Middlemas, moved to Memphis in July 2009 to begin shooting the film. In the process, they recorded more than 500 hours of footage to cut into the two-hour film.
“We’re not doing this unless we actually embed ourselves there because the only way to get the intimate moments that we were going for was for us to become a part of the team so that everyone forgot that we were making a film,” Lindsay said.
While Undefeated’s filming practices differ from the norm by documentary standards, this strategy worked well to establish the film’s authenticity.
“There are certain schools of thought that say ‘You weren’t directing if you were just shooting all the time,’ but part of that was to say we’re going to commit not just to the team, but to the community and to tell their stories responsibly and to take everything that’s happening in this community seriously,” Lindsay said.
The directors’ dedication to the team can be felt when you watch the documentary and truly feel attached toward the film’s characters. It’s hard to find a film as moving and rewarding as Undefeated.
 
Undefeated opens Feb. 17 in limited release.

The best short films are true works of art. With running times typically 30 minutes or less, they deftly convey meaningful stories and themes in a condensed time frame.

Unfortunately, with categories like best picture, best actor/actress and best director typically garnering the most attention during Oscar season, the categories for best short films often fall to the wayside.
Among this year’s nominees for best animated short film, best live-action short film and best documentary short are several must-see gems. Here’s a look at the standouts among the nominees for short films.
Best Animated Short Film
What Should Win: 
This category is a toss-up between The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore and La Luna — both combine whimsical stories and poignant soundtracks with stunning, colorful animation.
Directed by digital animation guru William Joyce, The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore follows the life of a young man who discovers the power of storytelling. Swept up in a storm while suffering writer’s block on his balcony, he ends up in a new world where books can fly and stories have life-changing powers. The film uniquely combines miniatures, computer animation and 2-D animation techniques with breathtaking, life-like results.
La Luna, Spanish for “the moon,” is another Pixar hit directed by Enrico Casarosa, the story expert behind Ratatouille and Up. La Luna depicts the coming of age of a young boy whose family is in an unusual line of work and must carve his own path alongside his father and grandfather. Michael Giacchino, the man behind the heartwarming musical theme from Up, composes a perfect orchestral backdrop to the film.
 
Honorable Mention: 
You won’t want to miss A Morning Stroll, a U.K. film that depicts a New York man’s early-morning encounter with a chicken, played out several times over 100 years. With the film’s shifting animation styles and use of humor, A Morning Stroll is a clever, light-hearted stab at how society changes over time.
 
Full list of nominees: 
Dimanche/Sunday, The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, La Luna, A Morning Stroll, Wild Life.
Best Live-Action Short Film
What Should Win: 
With Raju, German director Max Zähle creates what feels like an Oscar-worthy feature film in just 26 minutes, leaving the audience yearning for more. The film centers on Raju an Indian orphan who is adopted by a German couple. In a sudden turn of events, the boy disappears and the couple uncovers a disturbing truth. Set against the lively, congested background of Kolkata, India, the story shines because of terrific acting from Wotan Wilke Möhring and Julia Richter, who play the German couple. In particular Möhring — who is able to convey pain and conflicted emotion with his eyes, without saying a single word — steals the show.
 
Honorable Mention: 
Although viewers might prefer the lighthearted Time Freak, about a man’s obsession with traveling back in time to yesterday, Tuba Atlantic’s cynical humor and underlying message — that it’s never too late to be accepted — should garner the Norwegian film attention from Oscar voters. Oskar, the aptly named protagonist, is a pessimistic old man who is told he has six days to live. With the help of Inger, a young woman sent to be his public “death angel,” Oskar attempts to reconnect with his estranged brother before he dies.
 
Full list of nominees:
Pentecost, Raju, The Shore, Time Freak, Tuba Atlantic.
Best Documentary Short
What Should Win: 
The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom highlights the incredible courage and resilience of the Japanese survivors of the hardest-hit areas of the March 2011 tsunami.
Though the astounding footage of the tsunami destruction takes your breath away, it’s the hope symbolized by the blooming Japanese cherry blossom that embodies the film’s message. The beautiful, lyrical quotes shared by the people in the movie regarding their most beloved flower are awe-inspiring, especially regarding survivors’ ability to draw optimism and acceptance from nature.
 
Honorable Mention:
Both The Barber of Birmingham: Foot Soldier of the Civil Rights Movement and Incident in New Baghdad deserve recognition here.
Barber is a poignant, sentimental look back at the Civil Rights Movement and how far the United States has come through the eyes of James Armstrong, an Alabama native whose barbershop served as a hub for civil rights since 1955. Incident covers the notorious July 2007 Baghdad incident where U.S. forces killed two Reuters journalists and several unarmed civilians, recounted by former U.S. Infantry Specialist Ethan McCord.
Both films fascinatingly portray the ability of people to commit inhumane acts and, conversely, the courage of individuals who take a stand against injustice.
 
Full list of nominees: 
The Barber of Birmingham: Foot Soldier of the Civil Rights Movement, God is Bigger than Elvis, Incident in New Baghdad, Saving Face, The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom.

With love and the smell of roses and chocolates in the air, Natalie Angiuli released her EP, New Hands, on Valentine’s Day.
The four tracks on the EP, available on iTunes, were recorded at several studios in Los Angeles.
All of the vocals were recorded in a bedroom, according to Angiuli. Her producer, Michael Eisenstein, had a few friends with home studios in their backyards.
She said she is honored to have the opportunity to have her EP release show at The Hotel Café on March 29.
The songs on New Hands are catchy pop tunes that can easily become stuck in a person’s head.
A prime example is “Vegas (Think About Me),” because of the repetition found in the chorus.
Angiuli is a senior theatre major at USC, but is also working on a minor in songwriting. She said her writing process usually starts with jotting down a few words or musical ideas in her journal.
Her songwriting process was inspired by the artist Michelangelo, who used to chip away at marble to create the sculptures he believed already existed.
“The songs are there, and it’s my job to chip away at all the extra stuff,” she said.
The music and lyrics have simple structures and are typically standard pop songs. One has the essence of the 1950s though.
“Bel Air Anthem” is very similar to a doo-wop ballad. The lines “our love is a crime” and “they told us not to do it, but we did it anyway” is reminiscent of old crooner songs.
The title track, “New Hands,” turns out to be less vintage and more space-age. Not due to it having heavy synthesizer or other eccentric sounds, but because of an outer space dream Angiuli had that inspired the song and its name.
In her dream, two words, “new hands,” were repeated over and over so she jotted them down after waking up and the song unfolded from there.
“Wake You Up,” the last song on the EP, is more straightforward with a specific message.
“It deals with small bursts of confidence in the midst of a troublesome situation…where you know that you can win if you keep your head on straight and try hard enough,” she said.
Currently, Angiuli is continuing to write new songs, collaborating with other USC artists and exploring the world of film scoring.

Uggie, the beloved pooch, from this year’s Best Picture frontrunner The Artist, won Best Dog in a Theatrical Film at the Golden Collar Awards.
The awards show marked their first year in recognizing the work of dogs in film and television. The ceremony was held at the Hotel Palomar in Los Angeles on Monday, February 13.
It’s been a great year for dogs. Uggie was nominated alongside himself for his performance as Queenie in Water for Elephants, as well as Cosmo (Arthur), the talking dog in Beginners, Denver (Skeletor) from 50/50 and Hummer (Dolce) from Young Adult.
Martin Scorsese, however, felt cheated when the dog featured in his film, Hugo, was snubbed during nominations. The famed director had even gone so far as to write an editorial in the Los Angeles Times urging voters to reconsider and vote for Blackie as a write-in.
Uggie, however, was crowned top dog.
Omar Von Muller, his trainer, accepted the award on the dog’s behalf. Uggie, meanwhile, attended the ceremony, looking adorable with a bowtie.
