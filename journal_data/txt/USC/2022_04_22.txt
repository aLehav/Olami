USC is putting in work as it prepares for its upcoming three-game home series against Utah this weekend. The Trojans currently have a conference record of 4-11, but have an overall 18-16 record. 
Last weekend, Arizona State’s offense was too hot to handle for USC. The Trojans lost to the Sun Devils on Thursday 14-12, again on Friday 8-2 and succumbed to a close match on Saturday 9-8. 
Arizona State racked up 7 home runs against USC compared to only 4 from the Trojans. Head Coach Jason Gill commented on some inconsistencies the team has experienced lately. 
“It’s like when we hit the ball, we haven’t been really executing well on the mound, and when we don’t hit the ball, we seem to execute well on the mound,” said Gill in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re just falling short one way or the other, but they played hard.”
The Trojans played another close game Tuesday against Cal State Fullerton which ended in a 5-4 loss. Redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas went 3-for-3 with a home run and 2 RBIs, but it wasn’t enough to stay in the lead. 
USC let up offensively in innings seven through nine, leaving room for Fullerton to make a comeback in the final inning. The Titans’ junior outfielder Deylan Pigford’s single to left field brought in fellow junior outfielder Damone Hale. Then, Pigford scored on a wild pitch to end the game.
Sophomore relief pitcher Matt Keating has done a remarkable job at sealing the deal to close out the game for a win, but hit a bump against Fullerton.
“[Keating] has been our guy all year coming out of the pen. He’s shut down really good teams,” Gill said. “He’s just had a little bump in the road, and not just him you know, but last night that was him, and so we gotta try to find our confidence and get out there the next time he takes the mound.”
Returning to home territory, the Trojans will now face the Utes who are 7-8 in the Pac-12  and have a 21-14-1 overall record. 
Redshirt junior catcher Jayden Kiernan, freshman infielder Landon Frei and redshirt sophomore pitcher/first baseman TJ Clarkson lead the Utes in batting averages, hitting .361, .355 and .341, respectively.
Clarkson will be the player USC needs to watch out for, as he was named National Player of the Week last month. He has a total of 42 hits, 10 home runs and 32 RBIs. 
The past four games have surely left the Trojans disappointed, but also motivated to remain competitive and the need to remain confident. 
“Honestly, we probably need a little rest. We need to clear our minds,” Gill said. “It’s probably just confidence. It’s a very fragile thing and when you lose it, even briefly, it can affect you in a big way, so I think we need to try to find that back. I think a couple wins can get us going again.”
USC marches ahead into this weekend’s series hoping for redemption. The first pitch is set for 6 p.m. Friday at Dedeaux Field.

Ahead of the 27th Los Angeles Times Festival of Books — the series’ first in-person event since 2019 — the mood in the organizers’ office is nothing short of electric. To staff, volunteers and speakers alike, the return to University Park Campus is the restoration of a prized tradition.
“Everyone is excited to be back in person, back doing this event that we love so much,” said L.A. Times associate director of events Ann Binney. “And I felt that very same excitement from the authors that we have.”
The annual celebration continued for the last two years as much smaller virtual events, restricted by technical limitations and a sense of detachment that became emblematic of the public’s struggles during the pandemic. That estrangement prompted uncertainty among organizers, who anticipated audience and artist anxiety over returning to an in-person event.
“When we started thinking about [the 2022 Festival] in the fall, I was worried,” Binney said. “[I thought], ‘What’s the response going to be? Are people going to be excited to come back in person and do this?’”
Rather than seeding hesitance or restricting attendance, Binney said the Festival’s decision to return in-person has been invigorating, especially for artists eager to connect. With more than 625 authors, 260 events and 250 exhibitors, the event’s grand scale is comparable to those in the past, and organizers predict a suitable turnout.
“We have an incredible roster of people who are coming to participate and there’s that same excitement from them — they want to see people in person, and have that experience together and sign books for people,” Binney said. “That experience is one that people have missed over the last couple of years and that people seem to be really excited to be doing again.”
Writers of all genres will be welcome at the event, sprinkled across campus in themed areas such as the Poetry or Cooking stages or in ticketed panels in various campus buildings. As they have for decades, organizers seek to include authors and exhibits revealing the depth and complexity of language.
The weekend’s festivities will also include a USC Stage on Hahn Plaza, where students and alumni will treat visitors to an array of musical performances. Student performances have been a hallmark of the Festival since it moved from UCLA in 2011 and have put forth a wealth of Trojan talent at the nation’s largest literary event.
Though organizers said they learned much from the challenges of remote Festivals, they are fully embracing the in-person return by opting to not provide virtual components this year. The organizers plan to follow Los Angeles County’s coronavirus safety protocols but are requiring indoor panel attendees to wear masks and encouraging masking in outdoor queues.
The pandemic has also prompted organizers to alter their selections. While the L.A. Times has been reviewing speakers and submissions since October, they have expanded their view to include works published during the pandemic. Still, organizers have maintained the same admiration for and prioritization of Angeleno artists that inspired the first Festival 26 years ago.
“[The Festival] was a gift to the city, a call to readers everywhere to bookmark the page and come gather with us,” wrote the Times’ executive editor Kevin Merida in their Festival of Books program. “[Virtual Festivals] gave us an opportunity to reflect … But we have missed the communal experience. We’re incredibly excited to be gathering in person again.”

Besties, remember at the beginning of the semester when I wrote my little love letter to Los Angeles? It’s okay if you don’t, because I barely remember the beginning of the semester too. I wrote about how people actually do read in L.A. It turns out my words were in anticipation of the next couple of weeks in the City of Angels. 
For a very long time, I thought that L.A. was where literary ambition went to die. No one would want to write in a sun-soaked city when you could be seeking out reprieve from the heat in an air-conditioned movie theater with popcorn lining the aisles instead. For me, the L.A. aesthetic has always consisted of strip malls, long drives, sunglasses, jacaranda trees, Fleetwood Mac and Blackberry phones (until they went out of vogue). And to be honest, my L.A. opinions were slightly irrational considering that, for my entire life, the largest book festival in the Northern hemisphere was in my backyard, and I regularly attended.
The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books has been around since the late ‘90s and used to be held at the other L.A. school — if you care at all, those have been the only occasions that I have stepped onto that campus. Every author ventures to the Golden State for these festivals — if you’ve written a book, it’s a must. Certainly, if you love books, it’s a must. If you happen to be in the L.A. area during that one weekend in April, it’s a must (even if you leave after an hour to go see what’s on Hollywood Boulevard). 
In 2011, the festival moved across town to USC and because it so often coincides with a little festival in Indio called Coachella, some have coined it “Bookchella.”  
To top off the town’s literary reputation, the weekend following the festival, Santa Monica will have young adult readers descend upon the campus of Santa Monica High School. Lest you think they are returning for a second attempt at geometry and American lit, they’re actually there for the annual “YallWest,” a wild, lively festival filled with tons of authors coming to sign books, give out advanced reader copies and, on one occasion, sing “Hamilton” tunes for a singalong during the musical’s hype (after all, it is a book festival that has the energy of a theater kid). So in conclusion, as I’ve mentioned a thousand times over, L.A. is a reading city!
What makes the Festival of Books unique, though, is the catalog of USC professors who moonlight as authors at panels and signing booths and me: casually losing my mind at the fact that after two years, we’re finally back at the book festival. This is a holiday for me (and frankly, essential in maintaining my brand at the Daily Trojan). 
The book festival makes certain that the idea that authors are inaccessible is antiquated. I don’t know, maybe that’s my English minor coming out and the fact that I’ve been able to meet so many authors, never mind taking courses with some at USC. But, I think it is also due to book festivals and social media. 
One author that I’ve followed for the entirety of my existence on Twitter and thus, has always felt accessible, is Robin Benway. She’s one of my “SoCal’’ authors because her books often take place in Orange County, a departure from a more common L.A. setting. This year, Benway is coming to the festival to promote her latest book after a five-year hiatus, so I think it is somewhat appropriate for me to chat about that 2017 novel, “Far From the Tree.” 
The novel takes the reader through three different perspectives of people who realize that they are actually related. It tackles teen pregnancy and foster care while providing LGBTQIA+ representation. It has been said that it is perfect for fans of the television show “This is Us.,” and as a fan of both, I guess they’re right. Benway has a fresh voice, one that feels colloquial without feeling forced to sound as such. It has crackling dialogue, characters with depth and Southern California energy. Basically, I still love Robin Benway, and I cannot wait for her return.
I don’t know, I guess I’m really just on brand today, because I have yet another historical fiction recommendation. Ruta Sepetys is adored within the bibliophilic world, though I still feel like no one knows her name. (But now you do and are able to see her at the festival.) Sepetys is best known for “Salt to the Sea,” published in 2016, which tells the tale of the largest maritime disaster in history. The chapters are short, which bodes well for those that don’t regularly spend time poring over research, and somehow a 16-year-old Rachel noted Sepetys wrote with an “emotional immediacy” (What? I don’t even know). “Salt to the Sea” tells the story of the Wilhelm Gustloff liner, which was supposed to take refugees out of Prussia to safety in 1945. Instead, the ship was so overcrowded that it sank and 9,000 died. Sepetys added her own voice, with the narratives of four people intertwined with a historical perspective. It might make you cry (check out the Goodreads reviews) and it might make you angry that some historical events receive less attention than others (That’s what my history degree is in!), but it is such a beautifully written story.
If you want to look for stories at the Vromans tent, you have to go to the festival. It’s in your backyard! The weekend is unique and worthwhile to soak up. For two weekends in a row, L.A. and USC became the centers of literary culture. It puts aside my younger self’s morbid concern that books die in L.A. and my current self’s worry that there are so few readers. So, if you see someone moving through the tents like the Tasmanian devil, it’s me, and keep it to yourself.

This place is the perfect, Instagrammable spot to please any graphic novel fans.

In the early hours of Sunday morning, an accidental fire on the fourth floor of Nemirovsky College in USC Village forced 12 residents out of their apartments for the rest of the semester after ash deposits and water from fire sprinklers damaged their personal belongings and furniture. 
According to a statement from Steve Goldfarb, University director of fire safety, the fire started because of a “frayed computer charging cord” that set fire to a resident’s mattress during the night. It immediately set off alarms in the building and triggered fire sprinklers in the surrounding apartments. The residents directly involved in the incident declined to comment.
While firefighters responded to the crisis, many residents who had to evacuate slept at friends’ residences or were provided accommodations at the USC Hotel. When the Los Angeles Fire Department left the building, most residents were allowed to return, except for some apartments that required long-term fixes from the damage. 
“It’s slightly frustrating to have to move out and move back in during the last month of school and during finals week, but it’s no one’s fault,” said resident Lea Boulbain, a sophomore majoring in design. 
For some Nemirovsky residents, including Marianne Zhou, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, the sound of the fire alarm did not immediately urge her to evacuate the building — false alarms had occurred nearly “once every month or other month” throughout the academic year.
“I was asleep when the fire alarm went off at 2 a.m., and at first I thought it was a normal alarm because we honestly get a lot of fire alarms set off in this dorm,” Zhou said. “I was just going to go back to sleep, but then my friend called me and she told me to leave because there was actually something going on.”
The apartment on the floor directly below the fire site suffered damage from ash deposits that went down through the vents and water from the fire sprinklers that flooded into the unit. The walls and carpets became wet, and ash could be found in the bathtub, inside stove burners and around residents belongings.
“The carpet was basically spitting out water when we walked,” said Nikita Kholay, a sophomore majoring in architecture.
USC Housing directly responded to affected residents’ concerns about their living situations by booking temporary rooms at the USC Hotel, compensating food for the next month and reimbursing other costs of damage. Zhou said USC Housing was helpful and responsive in the aftermath of the fire, providing dry cleaning and covering other miscellaneous costs the damage caused. 
Those in the affected apartments have relocated to rooms in Troy Hall, Cardinal Gardens and Cowlings and Ilium Residential College for the rest of the semester, according to a statement from Director of USC Housing Chris Ponsiglione.

In stride with Earth Week, the Office of Sustainability announced Assignment: Earth on Monday as its environmental framework for 2028 and beyond. 
Assignment: Earth encompasses all of the sustainability initiatives USC hopes to roll out in the upcoming years. The University hopes to accomplish the majority of its goals in time for the 2028 Olympics, which will be hosted in Los Angeles. Multiple sporting events are to be hosted at USC facilities, with members of the media staying in USC Village throughout the event, giving USC a spot on the international stage. 
“We want to present USC as a viable model of sustainability,” said Dan Mazmanian, chair of the President’s Working Group on Sustainability in Education, Research and Operations. “What if we said we’re going to roll out our plan in 2029? We will have missed that publicity, the importance of saying something at the Olympics.” 
When President Carol Folt arrived at USC in 2019, her administration named sustainability as one of its pillars. 
“[Folt is] a biologist and an ecologist, so she understands the importance of all of this stuff and she understands how it works,” said Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple. 
Two core tenants of USC’s plan are achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 and zero waste by 2028. Eliminating plastic bottles, which was announced Monday as part of Assignment: Earth, is one step in this plan. Beginning July 1, plastic bottles will be phased out from campus retail locations, dining halls, the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, the Galen Center and the USC Hotel. The bottles will be replaced with glass and aluminum alternatives. 
The University is able to eliminate plastic bottles because of their renegotiated contract with Coca-Cola. Other single-use plastics, such as cups, may come from different suppliers and will not be affected by the changes. 
Retailers in the Village currently do not have to participate in the University’s initiative to cut back on single-use plastics, but Dalrymple is hopeful they will. 
“The USC Real Estate Office is trying to work with them using goodwill to ask them to come on board as well and join us in this endeavor,” Dalrymple said. 
According to Dalrymple, several stores have already independently started to transition away from plastic bottles, but the big challenge will be changing Target and Trader Joe’s. 
“The way that we’re approaching it is asking Target and Trader Joe’s if they have any corporate initiatives that help support what we’re trying to do so, we can kind of work together to bring in substitutes,” Dalrymple said. 
While eliminating plastic bottles is the latest announced initiative, Dalrymple said the Office of Sustainability has a lot more in the works. 
Along with taking steps towards zero waste, USC’s sustainability community is tackling Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions — emissions that can be controlled by the University. This includes changes such as switching to LED lighting and putting solar panels on buildings. 
To combat the ongoing drought, landscaping with high water usage will be replanted with drought resistant or native plants, and sinks and faucets will have water efficient retrofits.
The Office of Sustainability is not only looking to change USC’s operations to make them more eco-friendly, but also to change the community’s thinking around sustainability. 
USC looks to “infuse sustainability into everybody’s courses,” Dalrymple said. 
Rather than creating a school of sustainability, the Office of Sustainability hopes to add “sustainability themes and thinking” and experimental learning to general education courses. Additionally, 10 new courses on sustainability will be created every year. 
Another facet of USC’s fight against climate change is divesting from fossil fuels. The University announced in February 2021 that it would halt all new fossil fuel investments and divest its $277 million into standing investments, spurred by the student group DivestSC. 
In a February press release, the University said it had not invested in fossil fuels since 2018, but ​​the liquidation process would take several years because the investments were “primarily in long-dated private partnerships” and “illiquid in nature.”
“Our office has been making steady progress in shifting investments into sustainable assets, such as renewable energy, carbon mitigation, and land and water conservation,” said Chief Investment Officer Amy Diamond in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “These investments now outweigh the endowment’s historic fossil fuel exposure.” 
An integral part of USC’s sustainability push is the Presidential Working Group on Sustainability. Folt created the group upon her arrival at USC in September 2019 to advise her administration on new sustainability initiatives. 
The PWG consists of more than 100 students, faculty and administrators. While the PWG can only recommend new policy rather than implement it, the group has assisted with the ideas of Assignment: Earth. 
“There does seem to be the idea that maybe that maybe the University isn’t doing all it should,” said Sean McCalla, a member of the student committee on the PWG. “Just be mindful that the work is being done.” 
Earth Week at USC brings a number of ways for students to celebrate the Earth and get involved with sustainability at USC.  
“I hope students are able to enjoy and celebrate some of the good things, and then also learn more about Assignment: Earth and and get engaged with it and get involved, so that we can all propel USC to the top in terms of setting the example for how to run a sustainable university,” Dalrymple said.

On soil beds near the School of Architecture, a handful of people crouch around budding monkeyflowers, creeping barberry and red buckwheat with clipboards in hand, eyes squinted as they observe leaf irregularities and feel for soil moisture. The bunch — a mix of professors and graduate students — gather over a unifying cause and shared passion for native plants and ecological restoration. 
Test Plot, an ecological restoration project involving faculty and students across the landscape architecture field at USC, began in 2019 as an experiment in community-based land stewardship. Its name is a riff on a borrowed agricultural term that refers to the test work farmers perform to maximize yield, reimagined to convey the project’s mission to test plant selection, community stewardship models and landscape maintenance strategies. 
Jen Toy, a lecturer of landscape architecture, launched the project with the support and inspiration of landscape architecture firm Terramoto after recognizing the depleted ecological state suffered by some parks in the Los Angeles area. The team’s efforts began in Elysian Park, a beloved city green space, where they worked with citizens’ committees and local volunteers on a restoration project. 
With an initial site off the ground, Toy brought Test Plot to USC, where she began to teach a class anchored in hands-on experiential learning through planting and site monitoring. Three restoration sites have been initiated since: one in the Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, one in Rio de Los Angeles State Park and one right on University Park Campus. All Test Plot offshoots aim to incorporate existing caretakers and residents of the communities in which they’re based, Toy said.
“Our mission is basically to empower folks to engage in community land stewardship to promote biodiversity and address climate crises,” Toy said.
Hannah Flynn, a self-proclaimed “plant nerd” and a graduate student studying landscape architecture, joined Test Plot this past summer after working as a research assistant for Toy. She has used the adjoining class to complement her studies by not only designing for plants, but learning from them.
“As landscape architects … even though we’re designing for the outdoors, I think we can get a little divorced or a little far away from what we’re designing for,” Flynn said. “[Toy] came into our theory class that all the first-years take and talked a lot about the value of landscape architects, understanding the maintenance of landscape and the relationship that you have to a space when you’re working with it on an ongoing basis.”
Flynn was heavily involved in the site at Rio de Los Angeles, a park born out of the engagement of 36 community organizations that coalesced to reclaim the land for shared recreation and restoration. Flynn said she found the intentionality of Test Plot visits and work, as well as the relationships she built with the park and the community members that help maintain it, the most fruitful parts of her experience with the project. 
Asher Guzik, a graduate student studying landscape architecture, began helping out with Test Plot last August, his interest in the project stemming from his background in native plant horticulture. He worked his first job at a nonprofit specializing in native plants and chose to come to Southern California to further his studies in native ecology. Joining Test Plot has served as a way for him to combine studio work in the landscape architecture field with work physically on the field.  
“It’s also really important for people going into landscape design to feel that they understand what it takes to actually put things in the ground, separating it from computers or models,” Guzik said. 
The Test Plot independent study class, which Flynn is taking, is co-taught by Toy and Alexander Robinson, an associate professor of landscape architecture. The class’ instructors and students, along with several volunteers, established the USC campus plot — made up of the Rose Garden and Alley sites located in the shady walkways near the School of Architecture and the Roski School of Art and Design — over Spring Break. 
The team is currently testing the appearance, growth and viability of the native plants planted at the plots in an overall effort to create a campus landscape suited for the local environmental conditions. With a background in large-scale landscapes, Robinson came into the project with limited experience and knowledge of native plants, but said he has grown “fairly obsessed” with them since. 
“[Test Plot’s mission at USC is to] not just replace all of our decorative plants with native plants that are highly decorative, but to rethink the campus as an ecosystem and an environmental machine and then … rethink that kind of stewardship and engage the students with the landscape,” Robinson said.
The greatest challenges for the project so far, Toy said, have been receiving funding to upkeep the sites and provide for labor, as well as finding the right partner to be able to create Test Plots outside of the University. Toy said her dream is to establish a three-part model in which the project runs in partnership with community groups, Universities and land managers to test innovative solutions to pressing questions about Earth’s future. 
“Every community in L.A. and every school across the state, really, can have a Test Plot,” Toy said.

The Pac-12 basketball season left a lot to be desired.
Next season will be better. It has to be, right? Sending three teams to the NCAA Tournament is nothing. Imagining the conference sending even fewer teams next season is incomprehensible.
The only way to go is up. But, the conference has a bit of work to do before it’s competitive with the other Power Six conferences.
The Pac-12 is fighting somewhat of an uphill battle this offseason with some of the conference’s top names moving on to the NBA. 
Washington graduate guard Terrell Brown Jr., Arizona sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin and Colorado senior forward Evan Battey are some of the players whose departures to the NBA will drastically impact their respective teams.
Some teams will have a lot of pieces to replace. USC will potentially be without four of its starters from this season and UCLA will lose Johnny Juzang and veteran forward Cody Riley plus potentially Jules Bernard to the NBA Draft. 
So, with all of these departures from an already disappointing Pac-12 season, how is the Pac-12 looking up for next year?
The answer: recruiting and experience.
USC and UCLA are both in the 247Sports top 10 for the 2022 recruiting class. The Bruins are bringing in the No. 2 player in the entire class in Sierra Canyon guard Amari Bailey. 
This is important because UCLA’s freshmen didn’t make as much of an impact last season as expected. Now, the Bruins have first-year players who can and should make that immediate impact. The Los Angeles teams aren’t rebuilding, they’re reloading.
Oregon is also No. 18 in the recruiting rankings. That should be good enough for the Ducks to move up from narrowly missing the NCAA Tournament to securing a spot in next year’s bracket.
The obvious team not mentioned at the top of the conference’s recruiting is Arizona. The Wildcats are due for a slight step back next season and that’s not necessarily a bad thing for the conference. 
Following up a season as a No. 1 seed won’t be easy especially without a stellar recruiting class, but Arizona Head Coach Tommy Lloyd built this season’s dream team out of a roster many didn’t expect much from. With one year under his belt, who’s to say he can’t do it again?
Those four teams (USC, UCLA, Oregon and Arizona) making the NCAA Tournament would already be an improvement from last season. It’s not hard to picture Colorado, Washington State or another Pac-12 dark horse making the cut for March Madness as well. 
In terms of experience, a few teams will take a step up next season with just their current roster having another year under their belt.
Oregon had a rough 2021-22 season but senior guard Will Richardson returning for another season is crucial to the team’s development. Richardson missed several games down the stretch and will have a lot to prove entering his fourth year.
In the possible event that the upcoming Pac-12 season ends with as many teams in March Madness as this past season, the conference needs major upheaval. The gap between the Pac-12 and mid-major conferences will shrink to dangerously small levels.
Even in a down year for the ACC, the conference sent five teams to the Big Dance. The Pac-12 can only hope to get to that number at the conference’s peak. That’s an unsettling thought and goes to show where the conference is in the national landscape.
The Pac can get to where it wants to be. It can come as soon as next season. But with how top-heavy the conference is, the middling Pac-12 teams will need a major step up to shift the country’s opinion on the once proud basketball conference.
We’ll see, in time, whether the conference is able to. For my money, the Pac-12 will take that step. But nothing is ever certain in the so-called Conference of Champions.

For the first time in recent memory, the eyes of the sports world are on USC football.
The Trojans haven’t recorded a 10-win season since 2017. Fans and players called for the firing of former Head Coach Clay Helton as early as 2019. After an embarrassing 42-28 loss to Stanford in the second week of last season, their wish was granted.
When former Oklahoma Head Coach Lincoln Riley was announced as Helton’s replacement, he was followed to USC by a slew of high-profile transfers from across the country. It’s safe to say there are high expectations for tomorrow’s spring game. 
A typical spring game would see the roster split in two, with each squad containing a fair mix of projected starters, known backups and walk-ons. However, Riley announced in an interview that this year’s game will take the format of an offense vs. defense scrimmage. Fans will have to wait until fall to see how the team holds up in competition, but for now, here are three factors  to look out for this spring game that could forecast the success of the Trojans’ upcoming season.
1. Who’s catching passes?
Despite losing Drake London to the draft, the Trojans find themselves somewhat bloated at the receiver position entering the 2022 season. Between transfers, a recruit and numerous returning starters, USC has more quality receivers than reps to give.
USC returns junior Gary Bryant Jr., who started seven games in 2021 and hauled in 44 receptions for 579 yards and 7 touchdowns. Also returning are redshirt junior Kyle Ford — whose 2021 season was limited by a series of knee injuries — redshirt junior Tahj Washington and former four-star recruit redshirt freshman Kyron Ware-Hudson, among others.
Returners will have to compete with a number of high-profile newcomers. Five-star freshman CJ Williams will certainly command playing time, as will Oklahoma transfer sophomore Mario Williams, who carries an advantage in being the only Trojan receiver with whom sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams has played. 
Other newcomers include Washington transfer redshirt senior Terrell Bynum and Colorado transfer junior Brenden Rice. Bynum and Rice’s proven experience against Pac-12 defenses will certainly be a selling point in their fight for playing time, as will USC’s returning Ford and Bryant Jr. Additionally, Riley’s new offense will include a more dynamic role for USC’s tight ends, which will further complicate the competition for targets.
2. Transfers
The Trojans boast a number of high-profile transfers this season, and not just in the receiver room. Fans will see plenty of new players take the field Saturday and should expect immediate contributions from transfers on both sides of the ball.
Last year at Oklahoma, Caleb Williams threw for 1,912 yards and 21 touchdowns after replacing starter Spencer Rattlermid-season. But USC isn’t Oklahoma, and Williams will have to prove that his stellar freshman year wasn’t just a product of lackluster Big-12 defense. 
Considering Riley named sophomore backup Miller Moss in an interview as his most improved player for the spring season, assuming that the job is Williams’ to lose would be a stretch. The two have split reps throughout spring practice. Look for Williams to prove himself early on, and, if not, for Moss to take the spotlight.
USC’s running back position is wide open following the loss of Vavae Malepeai, Keaontay Ingram and Kenan Christon. Poised to contribute is redshirt Oregon transfer senior Travis Dye, whose 1,672 all-purpose yards led the Pac-12 last season. Dye will compete for playing time with Stanford transfer senior Austin Jones, who has been noted by coaches as a standout during spring practice for his explosive running.
Senior linebacker Shane Lee, who tallied 96 tackles with 6 sacks in three seasons at Alabama before transferring to USC, will look to contribute immediately in the box. On the edge will be redshirt sophomore Romello Height, an Auburn transfer who logged 19 tackles (three for losses) in 2021. Other notable additions to the Trojan defense include Colorado transfer redshirt senior defensive back Mekhi Blackmon and TCU transfer redshirt junior defensive lineman Earl Barquet Jr.
3. New scheme
Fans will see a different playbook under USC’s new coaching staff. Riley is best known for his Oklahoma spread offense, which popularized the concept within powerhouse college football. 
His variation of the traditional air raid scheme uses long-range passing and play-action to build on a successful run-pass-option game. This will help to incorporate more of the Trojans’ talented receivers into the offense, including the tight ends, who Riley said will take on a revitalized H-back role in the new scheme.
USC’s defense struggled in 2021, allowing 409 yards per game. Riley brought along former Oklahoma defensive coordinator Alex Grinch to take on the same role at USC. 
In his first press conference, Grinch noted that the team has “a long way to go,” but that the roster certainly holds talent. But Grinch certainly has critics of his own, as last year’s Oklahoma defense didn’t fare much better than the Trojans, allowing only 18 fewer YPG than USC. 
Riley has been hailed as the man that will bring championship football back to Southern California, and his offense will be powerful enough to do so. But for the Trojans to claim gold come January, Grinch will need to show he can do more with this defensive unit than he did for the Sooners.
There will also be pregame festivities for fans to buy USC merchandise outside the Coliseum. Fans can take a tour of the Scholarship Club after the game.
Kick-off is at 12 p.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Trojans will begin warming up at 11 a.m.

No. 1 USC beach volleyball looks to conclude its unstoppable season on top with one last senior day home match against crosstown rival UCLA. The Trojans play at Merle Norman Stadium at 1 p.m. Friday.
This season, USC has split matches against the No. 3 Bruins, where its one and only loss came on the first weekend of the season — UCLA defeated the Trojans in a 3-2 battle. 
Since then, the Trojans are on a 26 dual win streak, theirthird-longest in program history. USC is 27-1 this season.
Head Coach Dain Blanton said he looks forward to Friday’s match, as it will be a potential test for future meetings in the Pac-12 Championship in April and NCAA Championships in May. UCLA is a great way to finish the season.
“It’s fun, and it’s challenging, and the rivalry’s there,” said Blanton in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “You just want to go in, trust your training and play the way that you always play.”
The Trojans come off a successful 4-0 weekend at the Center of Effort Challenge. They took down four ranked opponents, three of which are in the top 10. 
In their first meeting of the season, No. 6 Loyola Marymount took USC and were tied in duals 2-2 until senior Tina Graudina and graduate student Hailey Harward took home the match for the Trojans in three sets on court one. 
USC avenged its only loss this season with a 4-1 win against the Bruins last Saturday. In the match, Graudina and Harward improved to 24-1 on the season, taking revenge on their only loss which came from UCLA in March. They won on court one 21-12, 21-13.
This week, sophomore Megan Kraft and graduate student Sammy Slater took home Pac-12 Pair of the Week. With this award, Slater earned her fourth-career Pac-12 pair of the week. It marks Kraft’s second. 
The No. 2 pair went 4-0 last weekend, making them 20-0 on the season. Kraft and Slater dropped just two sets, one against LMU and one against the Bruins. Both of these matches went the distance and were decided by a third set.
“It’s an amazing honor. I mean, it’s so fun to win with [Kraft], but honestly, these awards show that our team is doing a really great job,” Slater said. “The biggest thing is just being able to win this award for our team, and it shows how much people respect us and how well we’re doing.”
This week’s award marks the third Trojan pair in the last three weeks to be named Pac-12 Beach Volleyball Pair of the Week. USC has been chosen for this award 26 times, the most among all Pac-12 schools.
The Trojans will honor 11 seniors, graduates and fifth year students before Friday’s dual. For graduating players, it will be their final match on Merle Norman Stadium sand. 
“I want to just really take in the moment,” said Harward, who’s played at Merle Norman Stadium for five years. “[I’ll] just enjoy each moment and not worry about the outcome at all and just enjoy it with my team.”
For Blanton, he believes senior day will be bittersweet, but it has the potential to end their season on a memorable high note.
“They’re just such great kids, and they’ve defined the culture that we have,” Blanton said. “They’re really trying to become the best that they can.”
With the Pac-12 Championship less than a week away and the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship just around the corner, USC is locked in with hopes of taking home some hardware this season.
“We use every match to try to learn something and get a little better, and I think the players are really locked into that philosophy right now,” Blanton said. “The culture is good and the players are training that need to be training.”
Senior day festivities will begin at 12:45 p.m. Friday where each graduating player will receive honors. The Trojan Marching Band will be in attendance and there will be a Trojan Fever will giveaway towels for the first 250 students in attendance. 
The Trojans will begin the match at 1 p.m. at Merle Norman Stadium.

No. 1 USC will host this year’s MPSF tournament as the top-seeded squad, looking to close out a stellar 17-2 season with some hardware. The Trojans hold the only bye in the competition and will play the victor between No. 6 UC Berkeley and No. 9 Arizona State.
USC has led the national rankings for three consecutive weeks and is rolling off a seven-game win streak, including triumphs over No. 2 Stanford, No. 3 UCLA and two dubs against No. 4 Hawai’i. The 9-7 victory against the Bruins last week was hard-fought and just what the team needed heading into tournament play.
“Every victory against a top opponent counts towards the final selection seeding for any tournament, conference first and then NCAAs … Those wins are crucially important,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Of course, [it’s important] for confidence for the team as well. [UCLA’s] a close rival and it’s a high-pressure game.”
Against UCLA, the offense was flowing. Seven different USC players scored, and the Trojans assisted on as many goals. Defensively, the team was aggressive as always, committing 13 exclusions and only allowing three goals off of them.
The star of the show was junior goalie Carolyne Stern, who won the MPSF Player of the Week honors for her eight-save game. Pintaric said he knows this is the perfect time for Stern to be peaking.
“I’m very happy that she stepped up and had a very good game,” Pintaric said. “She worked hard preparing for [the UCLA] game, and that hard work paid off.”
This weekend, USC will have Friday off as it watches the other six teams duke it out for a spot in the semifinals. Pintaric would rather not have a bye — he likes to “get a feel for the water” early on in tournaments — but he’s focused on scouting and preparing well.
“We will use that time wisely to have an extra practice and try to simulate the game. In the past, what I learned from being a player and a coach, you can overlook that because you’re so dedicated in a tournament to feel the water, feel the competition,” Pintaric said. “We’ll approach it with high caution, with good training, good practice.”
USC will take on either Cal or Arizona State at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Saturday at 2:30 p.m. The Trojans handily defeated the Golden Bears 13-7 back in February and the Sun Devils 15-11 April 11. 
The USC defense was strong against Cal, holding the Bears to 7 of 26 shooting and stealing the ball 11 times. In Tempe, the Trojans spread the wealth offensively. Redshirt sophomore driver Alejandra Aznar enjoyed a hat trick, while five others chipped in a brace. 
Perhaps USC’s greatest strength is the plethora of attacking weapons, and anyone can go off at any time. 
Redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns has tallied 51 goals on the season, senior utility Bayley Weber has 47, redshirt junior driver and captain Paige Hauschild has scratched 38 times and senior driver Grace Tehaney has contributed 37.
Either matchup will likely favor the Trojans, and barring an upset from either No. 13 San Jose State University or No. 15 Indiana (whom USC both blew out of the water), the team will face Stanford or UCLA in the MPSF final. 
On top of the conference title, the tourney winner secures an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament next week.
“It’s one game at a time, always for us,” Pintaric said. “A national title is a big mountain to climb every year. It’s very hard to win it, and in our camp, we always approach it one game at a time. Once you’re in the game, it’s a completely different animal …  All our focus is on our next opponent, which is Cal or ASU.”
USC split the season series against both, 1-1, but have claimed victories in the recent weeks. It’s looking as ready as ever to battle either team.
The Trojans will first play Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and will either play either the third-place match on Sunday at 12:45 p.m. or the championship game at 2:30 p.m.

Dependable, convenient and free, many members of the USC community rely on the USC Lyft Ride program as an integral part of their college experience. The program guarantees free rides to current USC students, faculty and staff in the University Park Campus 2.5-mile zone from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
Like all things, there are ways in which the program can improve, such as expanding the boundaries of Fryft zones. However, we cannot call on the school to make this request until students are more conscious of how they treat the drivers. 
It is commonly understood that if you live in Los Angeles, you need to have a car. With the city’s spread out landscape, it remains difficult to get to places without spending a hefty amount of money on an Uber or dedicating the time to take public transportation. With the majority of undergraduates hailing from outside California and being on financial aid, it is unrealistic to think that they would be able to have a car or spend money on the increasingly expensive Ubers. 
Many college students live busy lives, studying full time and working, and if they live on campus, they may not be able to get out that often and separate themselves from their work. It is crucial that students should be able to take a break from school demands, as that has proven beneficial for their mental health and grades. Taking breaks and having fun can increase academic productivity.
Under these conditions, students would benefit from expanding the boundaries of the Lyft Ride program by at least twice as much. With greater access to the city, there would be more options for places students can go beyond campus without worrying about the financial burden of a costly Uber or taking public transportation at night alone. 
Currently, the Lyft Ride program’s main purpose is to provide a safe means of transportation, especially at night. Expanding the Fryft zone would make this program more multi-faceted; giving more opportunities to leave campus could result in more positive student body well-being. 
This is a very complex request for many reasons, such as the budget, timing and potential use, but most importantly, the drivers. There is a lot of thought that needs to be taken into consideration in regards to what is in the best interest of the drivers. There is a history of rudeness and disrespect toward Uber and Lyft drivers, and this history cannot be neglected. 
College students nationwide are known for being somewhat “difficult” passengers. Many students enter Ubers and Lyfts intoxicated, often spilling alcohol, being loud and reckless due to the alcohol, and in some cases, throwing up. Because of this, many drivers often avoid college campuses at night. 
The Lyft/Uber passenger-driver relationship started to gain much more tension nationally when the pandemic began with disagreements about wearing masks. Fast-forward to this semester when the University mask mandate lifted but the transportation mask mandate remained —there was a misalignment of expectations in regards to coronavirus safety. However, as of April 19, that transportation mandate was also lifted. This point needs to be discussed, because if a majority of Lyft drivers do not feel comfortable driving students maskless, that should also be understood and respected. 
We also need to recognize the blatant point that sometimes with free things, people can become rude. Unlike Uber, if a passenger has fewer than 25 rides on Lyft, their rating simply says “new” instead of a numbered rating. This notion, in combination with the fact that USC passengers aren’t getting charged in the specified zone, demonstrates room for entitlement. 
Though having the Fryft zone expansion would be incredibly beneficial to USC students, this request cannot be made until everyone fully understands how important it is to treat the Lyft drivers with respect and compassion.

On Sept. 30, geophysicist Dorian Abbot’s public lecture on climate change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was canceled after Abbot’s views on affirmative action caused outrage and angry protests by MIT faculty and graduate students. 
Abbot has publicly criticized race-based admissions, arguing in an opinion piece he wrote for Newsweek that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are a top-down, imposed regime that “seeks to increase the representation of some groups through discrimination against members of other groups” and violates the true principles of equality by “treating people as members of a group rather than as individuals, repeating the mistake that made possible the atrocities of the 20th century.” 
Abbot maintains that the underlying premise of DEI, which he defines as the idea “that any statistical difference between group representation on campus and national averages reflects systemic injustice and discrimination by the university itself,” is a fundamental distortion of the truth. 
In lieu of DEI, Abbot advocated for a system where college applicants are selected based on merit alone, without any consideration of group membership, legacy or athletic admissions. In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, Abbot said, “It’s worth stating what happened again: A small group of ideologues mounted a Twitter campaign to cancel a distinguished science lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology because they disagreed with some of the political positions the speaker had taken. And they were successful within eight days.”
Abbot’s case reflects the underlying tension between the pursuit of social justice and the freedom of expression that exists in our society and academia today. His is only one of the 217 academic “cancellations” in the United States and Canada, according to the National Association of Scholars. 
While the direct disciplinary action itself from these academic cancellations is not profound — although it can sometimes result in the suspension or firing of untenured professors — the real punishment lies in the public humiliation that ensues. For graduate students looking to enter into academia, the price is often greater, with one cancellation threatening to nip their professional careers in the bud. 
It is the fear of being ostracized that has led to the now common practice of “self-censorship” in academia. In other words, ostracization is the punishment. 
John McWhorter, a linguistics professor at Columbia University, wrote in The Atlantic that he has received 150 letters in the course of three weeks from professors who confess to living in a state of constant fear because their opinions do not align with the current “woke” ideology. An assistant professor wrote to McWhorter about being attacked by some progressive scholars who were regularly “mounting PR campaigns to get academics and grad students fired, removed from programs, expelled from scholarly groups, or simply to cease speaking.”
Colleges should be a fertile ground for the diversity of ideas and intellectual curiosity, but right now, we are witnessing the stifling of intellectual freedom on college campuses.
Even the most valuable idea, if reiterated ad nauseam, can lock us into tribalism and make us abandon the arduous but crucial task of independent critical thinking. The existing political bubbles in American society have already led to enough polarization and fragmentation in our nation, and we cannot let college campuses devolve into another echo chamber.
As the country’s pillars of intellectualism, institutions of higher learning should teach 
students how to think, rather than what to think. Instead, universities now implicitly encourage ostracism when faced with an opposing opinion.
I implore my fellow Trojans to not bow before the majority opinion and courageously stand by their original opinions, even if they might not conform to the “official” view. Warning the dangers of silencing dissent, John Stuart Mill wrote, “If the opinion is right, [people] are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: If wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.” 
After all, what is an institution of higher learning if the intellectualism permitted on campus is no longer unbounded or undiluted? What is a democracy without the independence of thought or freedom of speech?
