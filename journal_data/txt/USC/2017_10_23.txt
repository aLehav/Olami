To address the recent increase in tension regarding sexual assault, like the #MeToo campaign on social media, USC student group Trojans Against Sexual Assault hosted a “healing night” on Monday, the first such event in the club’s history. 
“Many students come into college thinking about the chance of sexual assault, expecting the school to respond,” said Kegan Allee-Moawad, assistant director of USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity in the Title IX department. 
Students of all gender identities and ages received information on Title IX at the event and discussed issues related to sexual assault on college campuses.
“The general climate that surrounds sexual assault on college campuses and in the world right now pushed us to have a ‘healing night’ instead of a general meeting, because that’s what people need the most,” said Tara Ruff, president of TASA.
Ruff emphasized the importance of students coming together to support each other in a safe place and being surrounded by people who care about and believe in each other. Ruff said the event was also created for students to learn about the laws and regulations regarding sexual misconduct.
“I think it was important we held the event among the [Harvey] Weinstein scandal, and survivors don’t feel safe,” Ruff said. “[It’s] important as a safe space with people who may have experienced the same things you have.”
TASA invited Allee-Moawad to answer questions, especially those regarding Title IX. Allee-Moawad began the event by describing the event as conversational.
Allee-Moawad described in detail the process that the department goes through when cases of sexual assault are reported by students. Because sexual assault cases are often circumstantial, she said, reports can be 50 to 100 pages when a case closes, with both parties being involved in the process.
Allee-Moawad addressed some misconceptions about how the University addresses sexual assault. 
For example, some attendees were surprised to learn that intoxication does not automatically classify sexual acts as a form of assault. Allee-Moawad drew a spectrum of intoxication on the chalkboard and described that survivors must be in a state of incapacitation to classify as a sexual assault.
Incapacitation describes when survivors are not able to legally consent and can lead to criminal charges against the accused assailant, if the case is reported.
Allee-Moawad said that survivors often report their experiences to remove feelings of guilt and to prevent it from happening to others.
While cases of sexual assault have reached mainstream media due to survivors speaking up, Allee-Moawad said that survivors from small, marginalized communities are often more hesitant to report sexual assault. She said this is because members of these communities know each other well and may be afraid of taking sides. 
Allee-Moawad explained that all cases of sexual assault should be reported and that if a third party coerces the survivor to remain silent about their experience, they can also be subject to disciplinary action, according to USC policy.
She said USC’s Office of Equity and Diversity in the Title IX department cannot guarantee a certain outcome, but it can guarantee an equitable process.
“You may think you’re alone, but you’re not alone,” Ruff said. “There’s so many organizations and people to help you and we held this event to let people know they’re not alone.”

Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, known as Professor Beau, is USC’s full-time certified facility dog and often walks around campus to spend time with students and help reduce stress. Photo by John Cha | Daily Trojan
With arms outstretched, Samantha Moynihan lies down on a blanket at Alumni Park, reaching out to pet the two therapy dogs, Charlie and Maya, stationed on her left and right. Moynihan, a freshman majoring in cinematic arts, has two greyhounds at home in Seattle. While she misses her own dogs, she said she enjoys spending time with therapy dogs like Charlie and Maya at the USC’s weekly “Pause for Paws” event. 
“I like that you can pet animals, and because they’re therapy dogs, a lot of times they’re the personality of the dog that really, really loves everyone,” Moynihan said. 
Pause for Paws was started a few years ago, said Diane Medsker, a health promotion specialist at the Office for Wellness and Health Promotion, which helps organize the event. At first, the dogs were brought on campus during finals week through a partnership with nonprofit organization Love on 4 Paws.
“We would do that once or twice a semester, and the students loved it so much, so then we thought, ‘OK, let’s do this more often,’ because the students were like, ‘We want them to come again,’” Medsker said. “So we started to bring them in weekly … now it’s one of the regular initiatives we [OWHP] are responsible for.”
Now, Pause for Paws is held every Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., in rotating locations across campus. OWHP works with USC Transportation, which provides free parking for Love on 4 Paws volunteers and setup assistance.
“It’s hugely popular and successful,” Medsker said. “We’ve started to track the number of students who attend, and even if they’re just there for five or 10 minutes, there’s something about being with a dog that lifts so many people’s spirits and just puts them in a better mood.”
Marissa Hernandez, a first-year graduate student studying social work, spent part of her Thursday afternoon hanging out with the therapy dogs. Hernandez, who has a Jack Russell Terrier at home, agreed with Medsker’s thoughts on the event. 
“I think it’s really relaxing,” Hernandez said. “It’s kind of distracting, both in a good way and in a bad way. I’m supposed to be writing a paper right now, but it’s relaxing to the point that you’re just really happy, and then your stress levels are really low.”
Moynihan also said the event gave her time to slow down amidst college life. Although she has class during most of Pause for Paws, she tries put aside the last 30 minutes she can attend in her schedule every week. 
“I think it’s a really good initiative, especially with just the level of stress, and how the … American education system is evolving to put pressures on students,” Moynihan said.
Pause for Paws’ popularity also led to the introduction of Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, USC’s full-time certified faculty dog. Medsker said that after hearing a positive reception from students about Pause for Paws, the OWHP staff began to think about the benefits and look into the research of having a dog around full-time. OWHP also hosts events where students can spend time with Beau, including residence hall trips, classroom visits and even an opportunity to schedule office hours. 
“Students can request him,” Medsker said. “We have an online request form. It’s very busy, yes, we have many requests for a visit from Beau.”
Currently, Pause for Paws and Professor Beau are OWHP’s only programs that involve animals. While Medsker said there are no plans currently to expand, the office would love to add to Beau’s pack. 
Moynihan had one suggestion for the office’s next expansion. 
“They had a therapy cat that was here last week, and I think they should start doing more of that, because I think that’s an amazing [thing],” Moynihan said.

Volunteers at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center packaged medical supplies to ship to the University of Puerto Rico Medical Center on Monday morning in an initiative led by Mariana Stern and Larissa Rodriguez, professors at the USC Keck School of Medicine. 
Approximately 50 to 60 boxes of supplies, which include disposable gloves, syringes, antibiotics and surgical tools, will be shipped out to the island on Tuesday after weeks of coordinating materials from medical facilities and pharmacies, according to Stern. 
Stern, a professor of research preventive medicine and urology, felt compelled to provide aid efforts for the island after speaking with her colleague, Marcia Cruz-Correa, a professor at UPR. 
“When Hurricane Maria impacted the island, [Cruz-Correa] told me what situation they were in. .. and they told me they needed supplies — supplies they use on a daily basis that they couldn’t get because they’re completely isolated from the rest of the world,” she said.
The UPR Medical Center is currently one of the best running hospitals on the island after its electricity was restored, according to Rodriguez, a professor of urology. It also has a comprehensive cancer center, similar to USC Norris, where most of the supplies will be directed. 
“There’s tremendous need in many aspects of medical care in Puerto Rico right now,” Rodriguez said, referring to the importance of support for hospitals across the island, many of which are running on electrical generators. 
Currently, the UPR Medical Center is not operating in its full capacity — only 12 of 35 operating rooms are open after the hurricane. Rodriguez said their needs are incredibly basic and can easily be supplied from the mainland. 
The USC Norris Center has dedicated a budget to this batch of medical supplies, under the discretion of Alan Wayne, the center’s director. Yet, Rodriguez and Stern still remain involved with Puerto Rico aid efforts. 
The two doctors are involved with Doctoras Boricuas, a network of physician volunteers created after the hurricanes that coordinates supplies directly to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Rodriguez has also launched her own funding efforts among friends and colleagues and reached out to Puerto Rican students at USC — many of whom are independently working on fundraisers — to foster a support system.
“The efforts that the government [is providing] are not enough to cover all the resources, so we really need, in the coming months, more of the grassroots efforts,” Stern said. 
According to Rodriguez, the supplies are only estimated to last the UPR Medical Center one month. 
“[It’s going to take] a while for Puerto Rico to stand on their two feet in terms of the medical system,” Rodriguez said.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that the budget for these supplies is $300,000. The budget was undisclosed. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Fourth Quarter All-Stars is a sketch comedy group inspired by Donald Glover’s New York University sketch group, Derrick Comedy. Photo courtesy of Maya Zaleski | Daily Trojan
A group of witty students sits in the writer’s room, suggesting ideas for its next scenario. One student, improvising as a character, delivers a random line on the spot. The group laughs and immediately writes it down. After a while, the members start to edit the written material obsessively for several days. After painstakingly reviewing every word, they are is ready to rehearse, with their focus on delivering energy. Months of rehearsals later, the group waits behind a curtain, as an audience is ready to see a fully animated sketch comedy performance. Let the show begin.
Founded last year by seniors Derl Clausen, a theatre and law, history, and culture double major, and Miles Woods, a narrative studies major, Fourth Quarter All-Stars is one of USC’s few sketch comedy groups. According to Clausen, sketch comedy is essentially a stage performance of that conversation someone has with their friends in which they attempt to make the other person laugh harder by telling a new joke. Clausen and Woods maintained this level of energy when they were developing this group with alumnus Kyle DeCamp because everyone was cracking up at each other’s jokes. The group then rented Massman Theatre to hold their shows.
Fourth Quarter All-Stars jokingly deems itself USC’s “Worst Sketch Comedy Group.”
“We realized that it doesn’t matter what we title our shows or even our group really,” Clausen said. “Most of your audience will ultimately be made up of friends and some word-of-mouth. We like to have slightly antagonizing and mostly self-deprecating titles to make sure everyone knows we’re super edgy.”
The team displays this edge through their heavily satirical jokes, although they do have try to have a wide array of other jokes, too. Particularly for Clausen, making the audience feel uneasy with jokes, whether absurd or self-aware, is fun to do. 
An example of this could be found in the routine that Clausen and Woods both consider their favorite. In the scene, the group asked one audience member to play a “fun, silly, Jimmy Fallon-style audience participation game.” The group asked the participant two questions, but then the act took a turn when it suddenly asked the person to guess Woods’ race, which was even more effective with the dramatic lighting.
Stage manager and set designer Wendy Hui, a freshman majoring in theatre design, and light designer Edward Hansen, a freshman majoring in theatre stage management, both contribute greatly to the technical aspect of the performances. Sometimes, this added factor of lighting and sound can punctuate a joke and help switch the format of the act. 
Adding small refinements such as playing rap music during an act where an Uber driver tries to make his guests listen to rap music about being an Uber driver adds so much more to the scenario. Clausen believes that if Hui and Hansen weren’t part of the team, the shows would be merely cardboard cutouts of a sketch show.
The group believes in highlighting this comedy because it puts writing as its top priority when creating a sketch comedy performance. Even if someone is not writing the script, they still have a part in the process by contributing ideas, even if it is as simple as having good energy. Recently, Clausen and Woods discussed the difference between the writing and rehearsal processes. They realized that writing was more taxing and could make them exhausted after only a few hours, whereas rehearsal was much easier and quicker.
“You can do four hours of rehearsal, bust out the blocking and performance on four to five sketches and go home feeling accomplished,” Clausen said. “[But in] the writer’s room, you can walk out of a four to five hour session with only a crude drawing of your least favorite troupe member.”
The members stress attention to detail in their writing because they write material with characters and themes that people can recognize. Even though the group decides what it includes in the sketches, everyone in the team has different inspirations for what they specifically want to write about. 
Clausen and Woods originally wanted to form a new sketch comedy group instead of joining a pre-existing one because they believed that they had such weird and specific ideas, and they wanted to write in their own voices. 
Fourth Quarter All-Stars’ philosophy is to start the sketches from a real place and then elevate them through humor. The group may use a place like Los Angeles as the foundation of its sketch comedy or satirize topics like job interviews or even people from the Bay Area. In general, however, the group often tackles specific absurdities in college culture today.
Both Clausen and Woods were largely inspired by Derrick Comedy, Donald Glover’s New York University sketch group. Woods honored Glover by making short videos of the same comedic tone. Clausen personally felt a strong connection with his first real group of friends when watching sketches together as they would tear up from laughing so hard and, eventually, come up with their own ideas. He considered this the moment when he fell in love with this kind of comedy, and he hopes that Fourth Quarter All-Stars will have a similar effect in helping its members. 
“The goal ultimately is that after being on Fourth Quarter All-Stars, you can write sketch comedy and you can write it really, really well,” Clausen said. “The performance will, hopefully, follow.”

“If you’re an actress, you’re either Juliet or Lady Macbeth. There’s really nothing in between,” declared the leading lady of Stage Kiss, Sarah Ruhl’s enduring romantic comedy about what happens when two actors share a real kiss. 
The dynamic Lizzy Ryland, a sophomore majoring in theatre, stars opposite Demetri Bouzos, a freshman majoring in theatre, as She and He, two ex-lovers (and actors) who get cast alongside each other to play ex-lovers that get back together. The pair quickly gets tangled in the magic of their stage romance, resulting in necessary, cathartic realizations about their respective adult lives and the nature of love itself.
At the heart of Stage Kiss is the multifaceted nature of the theater. Aeneid Theater Company’s  production exposes the audience to everything that occurs from that first awkward audition to the backstage relief after opening night. Perhaps the most captivating detail of the play inside Stage Kiss was its director, who was played by the scene-stealing sophomore theatre major Jack Eletto. Eletto was perfectly gracious in the comical, pretentious, eyes-half-closed manner of directors. At the start of their first rehearsal, he walks over to the coffee table and tosses a bag of sugar into his mouth. When She, still hesitant about sharing a kiss with He, suggests a slap before the kiss, the director purrs: “Try it!” The agent of the couple’s romance, the director watches in discomfort as their kiss turns from a dreaded middle-school encounter to a prom night make-out sequence.
The play’s understudy, Kevin, played by freshman economics and mathematics major Hank Funderburk, is thrown in when He catches a stomach bug and injures his ankle. The kiss that ensues between Kevin and She underscores the difference between a stage kiss and a real kiss: Kevin approaches She with his jaw unlocked completely, as if ready to bite a tree in half. 
“What a strange job we have, to kiss strangers and make it look like we know each other,” Funderburk chuckled nervously. In the second act, Funderburk plays She’s pimp, while she plays a Brooklyn whore in the director’s new play; the hilarity of watching him march onto set in a leopard print vest, a thick chain and gold-plated gun simply could not go without mention.

Most stirringly, our hero and heroine’s voices harmonized so perfectly in speech that you would think you were watching a musical. Watching the couple grapple with the reality of their script, seaming in and out of their character’s feelings and into their own, shed light on a very real and very human struggle to give up on the idea of blockbuster-romance for real love. After all, just as their stage personas, the two had other commitments waiting beyond the stage: She had a husband and a daughter, He had a girlfriend. 
As Stage Kiss director Jack McCarthy, a junior majoring in theatre and business administration, articulated, “It’s a world where theatre imitates life as much as life imitates theatre, leaving us to wonder which world is the ghost of the other.” 
Ryland’s character mirrors the sentiment after opening night, giggling on a couch backstage with her lover: “When I kissed you just now did it feel like an act or a person kissing a person?” she asks. 
As their affair continues, fueled by another play and an “ignorance is bliss” outlook, a final argument between the couple — punctuated by the blocking of a stage fight — ends in She’s realization that, “you can have a station wagon and an interesting life.” For a brief moment of silence, the show’s comedy is diluted by tragedy.
For its portrayal of human emotional pitfalls, Stage Kiss ends on a perfect, bittersweet note: There is an end and a new beginning that feels like a real resolution. Perhaps most importantly, the resolution acknowledges the feelings of those that make up the collateral damage of torrid love affairs. 
“The play explores how when we love, we allow for our life to include something beyond ourselves,” McCarthy said.

Arya Roshanian | Daily Trojan
I don’t joke when it comes to opera — it’s an art form I take very seriously. I’ve devoted many weeks to this column that centers around opera. I work full-time at a professional opera house. Eighty-five percent of the music I listen to is opera or classically based. I’m such a devoted fan that a few days ago, I booked an impulsive trip to New York City just to see an opera with some of my colleagues.
I leave in two and a half weeks.
The opera in question is the American premiere of Thomas Adès’ The Exterminating Angel at the Metropolitan Opera, based on the 1962 surrealist film by Luis Buñuel. The opera itself garnered acclaim at its world premiere in Salzburg two years ago, and is slowly making its way across the globe. Though I enjoy all eras of opera, I have a proclivity for 20th- and 21st-century works. I admire contemporary composers’ creed for investing in unconventional and offbeat stories, and for also seeking inspiration in the avant-garde. The result of their creations has sparked my own curiosity to explore unusual narratives. 
I had not seen the Buñuel film prior to learning about Adès’ operatic adaptation. Furthermore, there are a handful of other books and movies I now hold close to my heart after first seeing its operatic successor. In a way, opera has navigated myriad other interests in different mediums. It has opened me up to not only new music, but also new filmmakers, styles and aesthetics as well. 
After watching The Exterminating Angel twice in the last week, I found myself eyeing what to expect in Adès’ opera. The film focuses on a group of bourgeois guests who attend a dinner party, ignoring the abnormal tinge that lingers in the air. After retiring to the salon, following a sonata by Paradisi performed by one of the guests, they find themselves unable to leave the room. All the doors and entrances are still there — nothing has physically changed to the structure of the house. Yet when a guest approaches the entrance to the next room, they are simply unable to cross the barrier. They eventually realize they’re stuck in the salon. They attempt to remain cordial, but as days pass, all hell breaks loose.
Buñuel never explained much in the way of symbolism; the interpretation of these themes is left entirely to the viewer. I expound the obvious. The upper-class guests are unable to leave the room because, formally, the evening never ended (something I picked up while watching it the first time around but decided it wasn’t imperative to the story — I was wrong). Their early concerns revolve around social cues, and how to deal with the situation without appearing impolite. As days pass, these facades melt as they begin to turn on each other, bludgeoning each other for the shrinking supply of food and water. Their true colors are revealed amid the madness. They wonder if they’ll ever be rescued, unbeknownst to them that rescuers surround the perimeter of the house just as unable to enter as they are to exit. 
At times, the film is hard to watch. The way Buñuel captures their impending insanity is muted, yet uncomfortably accurate. There is nothing over the top about their mannerisms — all dialogue is delivered in moderate voice and action. I take it as the self-deterioration of the bourgeois class. In the end, it’s their own actions that cause the implosion.
How Adès plans to convey this in an almost-three-hour opera will be fascinating. Of course, emotions are heightened and dramatized for the stage, but it’s more so how the music will convey Buñuel’s simplistic delivery with new libretto that I’m most interested in hearing. I’m sure Adès wasn’t interested in making a carbon copy of the film. But the film’s premise does not simply revolve around how these guests can escape the salon. In fact, they all seem to give up after the first few days. The gut of the film is how each character changes as each day goes by. As food and water are depleted, the guests give in to their primal instincts. 
One by one, they turn on each other. One of the elderly aristocrats dies of a heart attack. A young couple eventually commits suicide. A sacrifice nearly commences against the host. When confined, each of the aristocrats, who were once concerned about social etiquette and overstaying their welcome, now find their worst attributes beginning to surface. One could say that the circumstances changed their psyche but it is never disclosed how long they’re stuck for. I guess a week tops, or else all of them would have perished. Surely, their beastly tendencies were intrinsic. 
The passing days feel like weeks, and they’re all waiting for something to happen. I couldn’t help but relate to their predicament. When I fall into a routine for too long, I tend to feel just as confined. It’s been a struggle attempting to balance a required routine with just enough room to shake things up so I don’t get bored. Planning this impulsive trip, though somewhat irresponsibly, will allow me some breathing room, a chance to listen to my body and give myself some time to frolic in the city. Like the guests confined in the salon, I hope to escape routine before losing my mind.
New York City is my favorite place in the world, especially during the autumn months. This trip is coming at the perfect time, as I feel the urge to pull out my hair from the duties of adulthood. I hope to have a few more irresponsible voyages before I’m forced to confine myself to a strict schedule. For now, I hope to escape my salon of responsibilities.

After a corruption scandal rocked the USC men’s basketball team, Andy Enfield lost a commitment from top recruit J’Raan Books. He gained a commitment from Elijah Weaver. Photo by Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
The men’s basketball program picked up a commitment from Florida recruit Elijah Weaver, a four-star point guard from Oldsmar Christian High School, late Monday afternoon.
Weaver announced his decision to take his talents to Southern California after whittling down his final choices to Ohio State, Oklahoma State and Florida. 
“I just trust their coaching staff,” Weaver said to Scout.com. “Their player development is second to none. They are all point guards on the staff and some that went to the league, and they can develop me.”
Weaver, a pure point guard who won a state title in Florida earlier this year, joins an already-loaded 2018 recruiting class that sports the likes of fellow ESPN 100 stars Taeshon Cherry and Kevin Porter. The decision to come to USC surprised many not only because the guard snubbed his local Florida Gators, but also because Weaver elected to commit to USC in the wake of the FBI scandal involving USC assistant coach Tony Bland and the recent decommitment by former Trojan recruit J’Raan Brooks.
“I’m trusting their program, and I know they didn’t do anything crazy that will cost them sanctions or penalties,” Weaver said. “I talk to [head coach Andy Enfield] all the time, and he reassured me that there’s nothing serious that’s going to happen to them so that’s why I went ahead and committed.”
Weaver, fielding offers from top-flight programs such as Butler, Maryland, Villanova and UCLA, announced his final four schools on Aug. 30 before finally choosing USC nearly a month and a half later.
Along with citing his relationship with Enfield, Weaver explained in his announcement that his long-standing association with current assistant coach Chris Capko started during Capko’s time on staff at Florida International.
“Coach Capko and coach Enfield — it was a mixture of them both,” Weaver said. “Coach Capko I’ve known a long time. He recruited me when he was at FIU. He was recruiting me since I was in the 10th grade, and our relationship has just been growing ever since.”
Ranked as the 42nd-best player and 10th-best point guard in the 2018 class by ESPN, Weaver will join a backcourt that features sophomore Jonah Matthews, junior Devin Fleming, sophomore De’Anthony Melton, redshirt sophomore Derryck Thornton, redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron and true freshman Jordan Usher. 
At 6-foot-5 and 195 pounds, Weaver brings size and strength to a USC lineup that already features another powerful, Southeast-bred guard in Usher. Regardless of Weaver’s future role in the Trojan lineup, his commitment signifies a positive trend for a USC basketball program rocked by the Bland scandal and loss of one top-50 recruit.
Now that Weaver is solidly in USC’s hands, Enfield could use this commitment as leverage to land other 2018 recruits currently on the fence about coming to USC. Four-star power forward and 62nd-ranked recruit Kamaka Hepa is currently weighing his options between USC, Gonzaga, Texas and Arizona. 
Four-star shooting guard Khavon Moore and four-star power forward Emmitt Williams are reportedly considering USC as an option, they but have not yet made their decision regarding their top choices.
With former Bishop Gorman star freshman guard Charles O’Bannon Jr. currently playing in a Trojan uniform, there is a chance that O’Bannon could help lure three-star small forward Jamal Bey. Ranked as the third-best player in Nevada, the Bishop Gorman star is deciding between offers from Arizona State, Nevada, San Diego State and UNLV.
With top recruits likely to announce their decisions before high school basketball season starts, Trojan fans are on the lookout for a potential late USC signing.

Redshirt senior striker Alex Anthony netted both scores in USC’s 2-0 victory over Washington. She now leads the team in goals. Photo by Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
The No. 6 women’s soccer team took a two-game road trip to Washington last week to take on a pair of Pac-12 rivals, and the team returned home with a pair of wins over Washington and Washington State.
Spearheaded by a dominant performance from redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony, the Women of Troy began the road trip with their sixth conference win, topping Washington at Husky Soccer Stadium. Playing through a torrential downpour, the Trojans took an early 2-goal lead. A strong backline anchored USC, and the team was able to maintain its lead throughout the rest of the game.
Washington started with the early momentum, but the Women of Troy quickly stole it back with their first goal of the night, coming in just the fifth minute. Anthony, deep into the Washington zone, muscled her way through a couple of defenders and slammed a shot into the back of the net.
USC continued applying offensive pressure for the remainder of the first half, sending several shots toward the Washington goal. With 11 minutes remaining in the half, Anthony was back at it again. Junior forward Leah Pruitt sprung Anthony with a through ball, and the redshirt senior found herself one-on-one with Washington goalkeeper Sarah Shimer. Shimer denied Anthony’s first shot, but Anthony did not give up on the play. The keeper was unable to gain possession of the ball, and Anthony tapped in uncontested on the rebound.
“It was pretty easy to post up — that was nice,” Anthony said. “We were isolated up top. It really left us one-v-one up there and allowed us to just play it into the high player and get around.”
Anthony’s brace marked her first multi-goal game of the 2017 season. She now leads the team with 7 goals. Anthony and the Trojan offense kept the pressure on the Huskies throughout the final 45 minutes, outshooting their opponent 6-1.
The USC backline, as usual, played a stellar game, allowing just three shots from Washington. This helped redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins tally her sixth clean sheet of the season, as the Women of Troy cruised to a 2-0 victory.
Similar to their previous game, the Women of Troy wasted no time creating scoring opportunities against the Cougars.
In the eighth minute, Anthony played a ball over to Pruitt, and from 23 yards out, Pruitt placed a
one-touch shot into the bottom right corner of the Washington State net just out of Dederick’s reach — granting the Trojans the early 1-0 lead.
But the Cougars’ freshman forward Elyse Bennett found the equalizer in the 26th minute with a shot to the far post from just inside the 18-yard box. However, the Women of Troy were not fazed by the tied score. They worked to find the go-ahead goal and pushed ahead once again in the 41st minute. 
Just before reaching the goal line, Pruitt dropped a pinpoint cross right onto the toe of sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre, who was stationed in front of the Washington State goal. Plumptre tapped the ball in to steal the lead and earn her first goal in Cardinal and Gold. 
The remainder of the game was a battle of defense. Neither USC nor WSU allowed a goal, despite 10 shots for the Trojans and seven for the Cougars. The Trojans closed the game 2-1 to earn their sixth Pac-12 win and improve their overall record to 13-1-1. 
“Today was a really gritty performance by our team,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I’m very proud of the way that we were able to manage the game and come out with a win against a fabulous and very tough-minded WSU team.”
USC will return home to prepare for a two-game stretch against high-ranked competition: No. 16 Cal visits McAlister Field on Thursday, and No. 1 Stanford rolls through on Sunday.

Despite making a quarterfinal run in singles and reaching the semifinals in doubles, junior Jack Jaede ultimately fell short last week. Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The men’s tennis team sent a host of players to Malibu, Calif., over the weekend for the ITA Southwest Regional Championships at Pepperdine University, and though the Trojans played well, they couldn’t capture any titles at the tournament.
USC started with six singles and three doubles teams: Three singles players advanced through the round of 32, and two of those went even further, into the quarterfinals. On the doubles side, two Trojan duos advanced to the quarterfinals. Juniors Jack Jaede, Logan Smith and Laurens Verboven all advanced in both singles and doubles, with Smith and Verboven tackling doubles together.
Smith and Jaede were the Trojans’ standouts in the singles bracket. Smith earned his spot in the quarterfinals with straight-set wins in all three rounds after receiving a bye in the opening round of 128. Jaede also made easy work of his first two competitors after a first-round bye, but he had to fight back to earn his quarterfinal berth after dropping the opening set.
In the quarterfinals, both Trojans faced opponents from Pac-12 rival Arizona State, but neither was able to prevail. Top-seeded Smith was upset in two sets, 6-4, 6-3, by unseeded Benjamin Hannestad, who went on to win the tournament. Meanwhile,
No. 3 seed Jaede fought to three sets with No. 11 Michael Geerts, but could not finish him off, falling 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.
In the doubles bracket, Jaede and redshirt junior Tanner Smith advanced to the quarterfinals along with Verboven and Logan Smith. There, Verboven and Smith fell to San Diego’s Joel Gamerov and August Holmgren in an 8-5 decision. On the flip side, Jaede and Smith were able to defeat UC Santa Barbara duo Anders Holm and Nicolas Moreno de Alboran to break through into the semifinals.
Jaede and Smith held their own against the top-seeded pair of Benjamin Hannestad and Tim Ruehl of Arizona State, taking them to three sets. The match was decided by a tiebreaker after the third set, but the Men of Troy couldn’t conquer their opponents, falling with a final score of 6-7 (4), 6-4, 1-0 (10-6). Hannestad and Ruehl went on to take home the doubles title.
This Thursday, the Trojans will continue the fall season with their first home tournament of the year, hosting the 61st annual SoCal Intercollegiate Championships. In the 2016 event, Trojan freshman Brandon Holt took home the singles title, and he looks to repeat the feat in his sophomore season. The doubles final went unplayed due to a rain delay, though Holt had also won a spot in that title match. This year’s tournament will run from Thursday to Monday at Marks Stadium.

As the Dodgers clinched the National League pennant Thursday night, there was just as much chatter on sports radio about Lonzo Ball’s debut with the Lakers that same night. Sorry, Dodgers, you’ve got no right to upstage the Big Baller Brand, apparently.
Before the Lakers tipped off their 2017-18 regular season against the Los Angeles Clippers last week, there was heightened speculation about what kind of night Ball would have in his official NBA debut. Coming off of a Las Vegas Summer League MVP performance over the offseason, the hype train for Ball was, understandably, a raging locomotive. 
Ball’s outing against the Clippers was underwhelming to many. In the Lakers’ season-opening 108-92 loss to the Clippers, Ball finished with 3 points, four assists and nine rebounds. Ball’s only points scored on opening night came on a 3-ball in the second quarter. 
A main contributor to Ball’s struggles was the Clippers’ scrappy, defensive-minded guard Patrick Beverley. In the 29 plays that Beverley guarded Ball Wednesday, the Lakers’ rookie remained scoreless and committed a turnover. 
Several sources reported that Beverley was outside the Clippers’ locker room postgame yelling, “Weak ass motherf-cker. Bring him out on the court with me, and I will tear his ass up.” Beverley commented further on his contentious game with Ball to the media, saying, “I just had to set the tone, man … I told [Ball] after the game due to all the riff raff his dad brings, that he’s going to get a lot of people coming at him. He has to be ready for that, and I let him know after the game.”
Instances like these make you wonder: Did LaVar Ball do wrong by his son when he made all those preposterous statements last year and into the offseason? Did LaVar write checks that his son is simply incapable of cashing right now? Throughout the entire draft process, there was no shortage of people commenting about the massive target Lonzo would have on his back due to his father’s rhetoric. 
Well, according to rapper and cultural icon Snoop Dogg — who appeared on TNT’s Inside the NBA postgame — “[LaVar] put [Lonzo] in a lion’s den with some pork chop drawers on.” The analogy is fitting. LaVar’s campaign for Lonzo, as expected, is now drawing some backlash as Lonzo begins his NBA career. 
Ball responded to the Lakers’ season-opening loss by recording his first career double-double in just his second NBA game. An assist shy of a triple-double, Ball shined with 29 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists as the Lakers recorded their first victory of the season against the Phoenix Suns. 
The Lakers’ most recent contest on Sunday night saw them drop a hard-fought game against the Pelicans, 119-112. In the loss, Ball was a field goal and a pair of rebounds away from recording his first career triple-double; he finished with 8 points, eight rebounds and a new career high in assists with 13. 
Despite the numbers, a good majority of the NBA public is still skeptical about the player Ball is becoming. When it comes to Ball’s urgency to pass the ball to teammates, there is no questioning his merits. But the Laker faithful and the general basketball community are pleading with Ball to take a more aggressive charge to score the basketball himself. 
And while several metrics appear favorable for Ball, others do not. He has shot 34.8 percent from the field and 29.4 percent from beyond the arc in his first three career games. The question marks about Ball’s shot and rhythm will not cease to exist until statistics prove otherwise. 
One can say many things about the craze that is the Ball family — from a reality show on Facebook to $495 sneakers to pulling a 16-year-old out of high school to homeschool and train him. However, one thing is certain when it comes to the Balls: Winning reigns supreme. The ringleader of the Ball empire, LaVar, is the first to remind the media that the only statistic he is fazed by is the win-loss column. 
At this point, the Lakers find themselves at 1-2. If you’re someone who fully believes that LaVar has the almost supernatural ability to “call things into existence,” then you are as convinced that the Lakers will win at least 49 more games this season as you are convinced that the sky above your head is blue. Only time will tell if LaVar’s prophecy of 50 regular-season wins for the Lakers will come to fruition.
One thing, on the other hand, is certain: As the Dodgers battle the Houston Astros on Wednesday night in Game 2 of the Fall Classic, Angelenos will still take time to click over to a relatively meaningless NBA regular season game, or refresh an app to check in on the Ball boy going to work against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
That’s just the undeniable power of the Big Baller Brand. Enter Lonzo-mania, Los Angeles.

When I was growing up in Cincinnati, I was reminded every day of my “un-Americanness.” The first time I had to think about something like this came when I was in kindergarten, and a fellow classmate of mine asked me if I was adopted. He assumed I was, probably, because why else would an Asian American find herself surrounded by mostly white students at a Midwestern elementary school? Years later, my high school social studies teacher would ask in front of the entire class if I spoke Chinese. The humiliation and self-doubt felt exactly the same.
Recently, an interesting trend has risen up in our president’s discussion of national news — specifically, his commentary on patriotism: on who is a patriot and who isn’t, who loves this country and who doesn’t. On my own end, I always felt a small tinge of uneasiness when I thought about traditional patriotism, when I looked at the American flag: No matter how much I championed it, there would always be a subtle split between what the flag represents and who people think I am. 
Recently in the Washington Post, reporter Eugene Scott referenced President Donald Trump’s recent comments toward the Pittsburgh Penguins, who were invited to the White House after winning the Stanley Cup, in an article titled, “What does Trump mean when he calls someone a ‘true American patriot?’” The president called the teammates “incredible patriots,” and told them that they “embody the values of dedication, discipline, and hard work.”
His emphasis on patriotism seems like an obvious, invisible nod toward the protest displayed by the Golden State Warriors — whose player Stephen Curry sparked the president’s fury after “hesitating” (in Trump’s words) on accepting an invitation to the White House. This has come into play at a time when sports and its potential for political protest has leapt to the top of the news cycle. Just on Monday morning, a recent presidential tweet read: “Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL!”
Curiously, Trump’s tweet just after that one referenced something of an entirely different nature: his controversial phone call with the widow of a recently killed sergeant, during which Trump apparently said, “Well, I guess you know he knew what he was signing up for,” but it still hurts. It was a confounding and startlingly cold line to someone who just lost her husband.
In a very certain sense, that sentiment is deeply unpatriotic: the dehumanizing of a soldier and his family, that humongous rift of empathy. It demonstrates an uneasy double standard: The president will condemn athletes for their own right to protest under the accusation that they are disrespecting military members, but then go on to treat real military families with extreme disrespect. Trump also continues to do so, responding to the widow’s assertion that he didn’t even remember Sgt. La David Johnson’s name: “I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!” 
I grew up without a strong idea of what patriotism meant for me, and how I could be included in displaying my love for my country when it so clearly believed I did not belong. When the NFL protests began, starting with Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the playing of the national anthem, I knew instantly that the pushback was — as the Washington Post article points out so aptly — because of race. To Americans who have the privilege of being considered normal and everyday citizens, the ones who get to decide what patriotism means and what it doesn’t, it is the person’s race in protest situations that matter the most. 
And yet, so simply, no one decides what patriotism means, and whose needs it suits — for that is the opposite of democracy, and the opposite of a free-minded and free-spoken country. I know this because I’ve always felt like a patriot, even when every reason otherwise has told me I shouldn’t — my parents are immigrants who arrived in the United States to partake in the American Dream, and for my whole life I have always felt that my accomplishments mattered in that regard. They mattered for my own sake and for my family’s. Each good thing I do is a reflection of my and our potential to break through every stereotype. Maybe in a perfect world I wouldn’t feel that every single move of mine counts and has ripple effects, but in this world I do. 
I love my country because of its potential to love me. And I will continue to assert my love and faith in this country until it turns around and does the same for me, and for everyone else who has never felt entirely protected by the American flag. To me, there is nothing more patriotic than fighting for your own right to be recognized as an American, one whose voice and actions count just as much as everyone else’s.

Patriotism is nationalism for people who are afraid to call themselves nationalist.
Patriotism means America: love it or leave it. Ms. Cheng should trade her grievance gown for an Army uniform and check back in a few years.
Create a straw man to glorify in knocking it down.
Zoe’s last paragraph is beautiful. She asserts her love and fidelity, expects it to be fully reciprocated, but does not condition her love toward how and when that reciprocation is fulfulled. Well written, Zoe. She is a patriot who calls out flaws, but still believes in her homeland.
And patriotism has a simple dictionary definition, but how an individual person feels about his or her country can vary widely within that definition. Perhaps someone who kneels, or more harshly yet, sits, during the National Anthem could be considered as still patriotic, while angry about how blacks may be mistreated or slighted by some in our country. Or maybe they despise their country. Maybe.
If you ask some of those demonstating types, though, how many would say “I hate this f___in’ country, but I was born here, so here I am.” Who knows? We cannot know about how people feel about their country until they tell us. Or demonstrate their feelings in other ways.

With midterm season in full swing, students may be utilizing a quick and easy fix to academic procrastination prevalent on many campuses: attention deficit disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication.
In a 2015 Medical News Today article, University of South Carolina researcher Kari Benson discussed a study that found the desire for performance-improving stimulants on campus is an imminent concern: 17 percent of college students misuse ADHD medication by exceeding their prescription or taking it without a prescription at all. More concerning, though, is the fact that the facilitators are often students themselves.
Medication for attention-deficit disorders include Adderall, Concerta and Ritalin — all stimulants that contain amphetamines or methylphenidate. These drugs target the central nervous system and boost cognitive control, but heavy recreational use leads to a built tolerance demanding higher and more frequent doses at an increasing pace.
In many cases, immaturity has been likened to disease, and the damage done by this prevalent attitude is disturbing. A 2010 study published in the Journal of Health Economics revealed that age may be the key behind high ADHD diagnoses across America: Among the kindergarteners studied, 10 percent of those born in August (the youngest in the class) were diagnosed with ADHD, compared to only 4.5 percent of those born in September (the oldest). Those in the youngest group showed double the likelihood of being treated with psychostimulants than those in the eldest. Researchers estimate that this figure alone could have led to 900,000 misdiagnoses of ADHD.
According to 2011 research by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, the past 20 years have seen the rate of diagnosis of ADHD skyrocket from 3 to 15 percent – and that is not because natural selection yielded a generation of inherently unfocused and apathetic human beings. The reality is that current methods of identifying and diagnosing ADHD fall grossly short of an objective standard. The legitimacy of mental disorders should never be brought into question, but overdiagnosis of attention-deficit disorders among young people without actual need for medication deserves scrutiny.
The result of decades of incorrect diagnoses is that an unparalleled proportion of college students has prescribed psychostimulants, and many among them are unafraid to reap the lucrative benefits of sharing. To put it bluntly, more than a sixth of students are popping Adderall and Ritalin like candy, on American college campuses disregarding the long-term consequences.
These Schedule II controlled substances stimulate the flow of dopamine in the brain’s reward center, offering those hours of undisrupted binge-studying students crave. But while they intensify certain kinds of attention and recall, they do not actually improve one’s ability to multitask and engage in complex learning, proving arguably futile outside the immediate context of crystallized learning. The comedown is emotionally rough and the side effects, even for those with real diagnoses, are unpleasant; headaches, insomnia and lack of appetite are a few examples.
A 2014 study conducted by the Pediatric Academic Societies showed that even recommended doses of amphetamines can have adverse effects on the developing brain. Animal exposure has proved long-term use contributes to reduced brain plasticity and weakened memory function. By recklessly consuming drugs, students are irreversibly hurting their natural abilities.
In many cases, they are also perpetuating a cycle of dependence already in play: Massachusetts General Hospital found that 20 percent of students who misuse prescription stimulants also abuse  other drugs and alcohol. 
Attention deficit disorders are real, chronic conditions, but the line separating immaturity and disease must be drawn more clearly to prevent this epidemic from spiraling out of control. More importantly, our University should address this rampant trend, and consider why the academic atmosphere on campus has grown so tense and what it can do to help students cope.
The superficially academic nature of prescribed ADHD medication paints it in a different light than other drugs altogether. But this misinformed view has no place on college campuses, or anywhere at all: Adderall and Ritalin are in the same medical and legal bracket as addictive substances like cocaine and methamphetamine. They are far from a harmless, last-minute energy boost to propel students through midterm studying, and should not be treated as such.
If the brazen pill-popping culture on college campuses continues to grow exponentially, the demand will ultimately exceed the supply. And if the supply runs out, much of the damage will already have been done.
