Do you want to know how much money I’m making by writing this article? Fifteen dollars. Max. And when I work as a deputy copy editor, I earn a mere five dollars for my entire shift, which lasts a minimum of three hours. We receive surprisingly little here at the Daily Trojan, though you might not know it from the vague claim on our website that “All staff members are paid per piece published in the Daily Trojan.”
Despite our lack of significant financial recognition, the staff at the Daily Trojan work incredibly hard to produce this newspaper every day to inform, question and support the USC community. As the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression puts it, “Student publications play a vital role in informing students about events and occurrences on campus, exposing wrongdoing, holding leadership accountable, and informing the larger community about relevant events.” With such an important role on campus, why aren’t members of USC’s student newspaper being compensated adequately?
At the Daily Trojan, contributors receive appreciation honorarium stipend payments funded by the Division of Student Affairs. It is important to note before discussing specifics that we at the Daily Trojan do not call our stipends “compensation,” “pay” or “wages.” We are not given enough in our honorarium stipends to constitute a working wage, and therefore classify our “compensation” as an “appreciation honorarium stipend.”
Staff members are divided into two groups for honorarium purposes: the masthead (managing and section editors, directors, etc.) and content contributors to the paper (writers, photographers, artists, etc.). But this has not always been the case: About ten years ago, honorarium practices were revised after research into student newspaper best practices throughout the United States.
Before this, the editor-in-chief was provided a lump sum to distribute to any staffers and that freedom was often abused through favoritism. Changing this practice ensured that content contributors would receive honorarium stipends for their work and stipulated that the editor-in-chief only had control over distributing the masthead honorariums in an effort to promote equity.
Masthead consists of 28 staff members who fill the positions of editor-in-chief, section editors, managing editors and directors of internal affairs. Their honorariums are distributed by the editor-in-chief out of a yearly budget which, this year, is $50,108. Individual honorariums have ranged from $350 to $1750 this semester, but change with each masthead and editor-in-chief.
The majority of the 350 staffers at the Daily Trojan are content contributors, who are given honorariums based on their published work. The budget for these content contributor honorariums currently consists of $33,000 per year and is distributed at set rates: $8 for photos, $10 for artwork, between $11 and $15 for articles, $8 for podcasts and videos and $5 per shift for copy editors.
With changes to the journalism industry at large, the Daily Trojan has had to take on more responsibilities and staff to keep up with the times. Pushes for mental health and wellness, diversity and inclusion and the addition of online and podcasting branches have added to the number of staff members that the Daily Trojan requires. With the addition of these staffers, the budgets allocated for the Daily Trojan are regularly split into more and more pieces with each getting smaller.
Further, these honorarium rates do not account for the drastic raise in inflation over the past decade, from 1.6% in January 2013 to 6.4% in January 2023. In fact, with the need for more staff to ensure accurate reporting despite budget constraints, copy editors are about to suffer a loss in stipend rates from $5 per shift to $4.
Writing for a student newspaper provides staffers with valuable professional skills, connections and the opportunity to explore their power as writers and reporters. These opportunities are essential for many students seeking careers in journalism, making the lack of meaningful compensation a massive barrier to entry in the field.
The Daily Trojan’s Fall 2022 Diversity Staff Report, whose survey had an 86.69% response rate, showed that over 30% of the staff relied on need-based financial aid. Furthermore, 59.3% of staff worked additional jobs outside of the newspaper to support themselves. Students who do not have to rely on a second job have more time to commit to the paper and therefore have an advantage in their success here and further in the industry.
This issue is not one constrained to the Daily Trojan. The former editor-in-chief of Georgetown’s The Hoya, Riley Rogerson, spoke of similar issues during her time there.
“The lack of compensation unfairly benefited students who did not need to work a paying job. The students who had the resources to commit time — sometimes up to 40 hours a week — to The Hoya were often able to more quickly gain leadership positions,” Rogerson said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
It is easy to see the similarities between The Hoya’s situation and our own — as someone who does not need the financial support of a second job, I can commit myself more fully to the Daily Trojan and have been able to take on multiple roles as both an opinion writer and deputy copy editor.
“Pursuing staff compensation at a school newspaper was an uphill battle, but a vitally important one to break down barriers to entry in student journalism and the journalism industry at large,” Rogerson said. “Unfortunately, during my tenure at The Hoya, those efforts were ultimately fruitless.”
Mona Cravens, the Director of Student Publications at USC, has held her position since 1976 and personally attested to the importance of student newspapers.
“[The Daily Trojan’s] most paramount purpose is to serve as the collective voice of our students,” Cravens said. “Here, we have the forum of our paper who can question anything that goes on, and not just question but applaud things.”
The University itself acknowledges the newspaper’s importance in its Statement of Policy for the Operation of the University of Southern California Daily Trojan: “[USC] recognizes the Daily Trojan as a valuable aid in establishing and maintaining an atmosphere of free and responsible discussion and of intellectual exploration of the campus. It is recognized as one of the principal means of bringing student concerns to the attention of the faculty and the administra­tion and of formulating student opinion on various issues on the campus and in the world at large.”
Cravens added that USC, like many other universities, does not define contributions to the student newspaper as a part time work. This is mainly because staff at student newspapers are not technically employed by the school, and so, legally, they do not have to be paid. That distinction prevents financial issues for the University like the residential assistant strike in 2021 or the movement for graduate student workers to unionize in late 2022, in which students’ presence on payroll allowed them the grounds to fight for fair pay.
But that distinction also benefits the newspaper: In order to maintain journalistic independence and operate without University oversight, the Daily Trojan cannot be equated with other part time student jobs. For similar reasons, we cannot constitute a recognized student organization either, which is the category under which most clubs on campus fall.
Instead, as Cravens put it, the Daily Trojan is operated as “a volunteer learning experience.” While it is certainly an invaluable learning opportunity, I would call anything with shifts, production deadlines and “compensation” — albeit minimal and in the form of honorariums — a job.
We aren’t the only student group that receives honorarium stipends for our work: the Undergraduate Student Government receives stipends for their contributions to our student community as well. In 2018, the USG president reported working 20-30 hours per week which is very comparable to the Daily Trojan’s masthead work hours — the difference being that the USG president is provided a whopping $9,000 stipend compared to the meager $350 to $1,750 range at the Daily Trojan. Those on masthead estimate that they spend an average of 20 hours per week here at the Daily Trojan — with some reporting typical weeks of up to 45 hours of work — which certainly constitutes the commitment of a part time job.
Some student newspapers have found their way around the issue of maintaining editorial independence while still receiving compensation: Staff at the Montana Kaimin of the University of Montana are compensated through a $7 student fee collected each year. The University of Iowa’s The Daily Iowan is funded through a combination of student fees, advertisements and even donations. Some of these student fees have been branded as “mass subscriptions” to the student newspaper.
Countless hours of work go into producing our newspaper every day. One article goes through at least seven people’s hands before being printed, not to mention the time and energy writers spend on the pieces, or the photos, artwork and layout teams who labor for hours getting everything ready for print five nights a week. 
We deserve better, and we won’t sacrifice our journalistic independence and integrity to do so. However, there exists a solution that maintains staff independence and gives them a bit more for their time. I propose that we add an annual student fee of $1 to $5 to be collected as funding for the Daily Trojan, acting essentially as a subscription. Although we as students are already struggling with tuition increases, the Daily Trojan is essential to our campus and community, and by adding only $2 to student costs, we could increase the funding for honorarium stipends by $98,000. That would more than double the current budget for student honorariums, which totals $83,108.In the corner of our newsroom, peering over the news desk during each 10-hour production day, there hangs a whiteboard littered with colors, names and numbers. For as far back as anyone can remember, it’s been dedicated to keeping track of the earliest or latest the last person in the office or in a section leaves on a production night. These times currently range from 6:03 p.m. (for only the copy editing section) to 3:16 a.m. (for the entire production team, a record set while printing this semester’s USG election guide) — pretty late to get off from a job that doesn’t even pay minimum wage.

Marking Indonesian artist Mulyana’s first solo show in Los Angeles is the newest exhibition at the USC Fisher Museum of Art. “Mulyana: Modular Utopia” centers around climate change and the relationship between human beings and nature. Mulyana uniquely conveys his take on how human beings have affected the natural world around them through the contrasting galleries included in his exhibition. 
Through his mode of art, knitting, Mulyana creates knit modules of underwater scenes that both bring to life the beauty he sees in nature and the harm he has witnessed human pollution do to these underwater habits. His work attempts to reconcile how human beings can peacefully coexist with the beauty the natural world provides without damaging it. 
When viewers first walk into the exhibition, two massive installations of gray crocheted coral reefs directly face the entrance, forcing viewers to immediately grapple with the detrimental effects human pollution has already had on nature, such as turning vibrant coral reefs into graying habitats. Flanking either side of the gray coral reefs are some of Mulyana’s much more colorful and vibrant costume artworks. On one side sits “Si Koneng” (2022), a bright yellow knitted costume that represents Mulyana’s belief that life is “articulated through movement.” On the other side, is another costume artwork, “Adikara” (2020). Composed of vibrant greens, yellows, blues and pinks, the costume takes inspiration from coral reefs and is meant to signify “the singular human ability to choose between good and evil.” 
While these costumes are intricate and impressive, the true crux of Mulyana’s message on balancing environmentalism and humanitarianism is best presented by the two opposing galleries that are hidden deeper within the exhibition: “Satu” and “Ocean Wonderland.” These two galleries are meant to be immersive art installations, allowing viewers to engage in two contrasting experiences. 
As viewers wander deeper into the left side of the exhibition, they enter the world of “Satu,” a title meaning “one” or “fullness” in Mulyana’s native language, Indonesian. The installation consists of a sea of white knitted jellyfish suspended from the ceiling, which drift overhead a white 30-foot-long 3D-printed whale skeleton. Inspired by the way coral reefs turn white under stress, Mulyana uses the all-white landscape and skeleton to call attention to the threat human carelessness poses to nature’s vibrancy and life. Standing underneath the fall of white jellyfish and faced with the imposing skeleton, viewers are asked to make peace with the damage that has already been done to underwater habitats and asked to do better. 
As is written in the opening statement for the “Satu” gallery, “Mulyana desires the viewer to experience a sense of calm while surrounded by white moguses, jellyfish and coral islands.” 
On the other side of the exhibition is Mulyana’s second gallery: “Ocean Wonderland.” In stark contrast from “Satu,” “Ocean Wonderland” is overwhelming in its vibrancy, its energy, and the life it showcases. “Ocean Wonderland” features a school of bright yellow fish suspended from the ceiling, as if serving as a foil to Satu’s sea of colorless jellyfish. Arranged underneath the yellow fish are various colorful knitted corals and reefs. A life-sized stuffed black whale sculpture that viewers can sit on overlooks the scene, posing another sharp contrast to the whale skeleton presented in Satu. 
Included in “Ocean Wonderland” is the work “Modular Monster,” which allows audiences to interact with a mirror with various stuffed and knitted segments to create their own sea creatures in the reflection. In “Ocean Wonderland,” an immersive experience of vibrant colors and scenes and where viewers are asked to interact with the artwork, viewers are transitioned away from the colorless scene of “Satu.” They are presented with a brighter and more colorful scene that implores viewers to consider a better future for both themselves and their surroundings. 
Climate change can be hard to grapple with — news headlines about the changing weather patterns and new natural disasters are frightening — and when so much damage has already been done to natural habitats, changing our lifestyles seems almost unnecessary. However, Mulyana takes it upon himself in “Modular Utopia” to implore viewers to seek better solutions in a much more optimistic and welcoming way. By placing the “Satu” and “Ocean Wonderland” galleries side by side, viewers are guided to simultaneously acknowledge the damage that has already been done and look onward toward a more hopeful future of cherishing and fostering the vibrancy and life that underwater habitats can provide. 
As Mulyana writes, “rather than appeal to our fear of impending doom … he desires to incite a proactive response to the realities of our contemporary world.”
Mulyana: Modular Utopia is on display at Fisher Museum until April 13.

More than two-thirds of USC undergraduate students — which amounts to 14,000 students — receive financial aid in varying forms, such as need-based grants, merit scholarships, loans or work-study, the latter specifically relying on students getting on-campus jobs with wages sponsored by the government on the University’s behalf. But as of Feb. 26, connectSC — a USC Career Center resource that helps students find on-campus jobs – displays 11 available on-campus work-study jobs and nine on-campus, non-work-study jobs. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Feb. 23, USC Student Affairs wrote that for the 2022 fiscal year, connectSC displayed a total of 542 on-campus jobs, 306 of which qualified as work-study positions and 236 that were not work-study positions.
From July 2022 to now, USC Student Affairs said that it had 286 on-campus jobs, 188 of which are work-study positions.
Duke Bristow, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering and a student worker in a senior design lab, said he thinks the Career Center could do a better job at promoting available positions. 
“Sometimes, it’s not clear to students there’s these possibilities on campus for you to get involved and get paid and to work,” Bristow said. “They can do a little better of a job in that regard.”
Bristow said he heard about his job from a friend who left the position to take an internship.
Kayasana Croft, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, has worked as a student ambassador at the USC call center. Croft got the position from an email alerting students about the job opportunity. 
“Since a lot of positions on campus aren’t doing that, it’s been very difficult for me to find a new position, and I haven’t been successful yet,” Croft said. “ Most of them hire within the first couple of weeks of school and they are not advertised very well.”
“Getting work-study or on-campus jobs usually comes from word-of-mouth — at least, that’s been my experience. I know people recommend connectSC but, personally, it has been a lot easier to hear from word-of-mouth.”
While Croft received the email about the call center “just out of luck,” Croft said she has primarily heard of jobs through friends, rather than being able to find them herself. 
“I have searched on connectSC and have applied to jobs through there, to really limited success,” Croft said. “There should be some sort of easy way to look for jobs to apply to.” 
Kiana Ong, a sophomore majoring in public relations, works in the Financial Aid Office and previously worked at the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. Ong, like Croft, said she found that word-of-mouth was the best avenue for finding jobs.
“My second year, I realized that getting work-study or on-campus jobs usually comes from word-of-mouth — at least, that’s been my experience,” Ong said. “I know people recommend connectSC but, personally, it has been a lot easier to hear from word-of-mouth.”
Ong said she attended the Federal Work-Study Job Fair the USC Career Center hosts twice a year when she was a freshman, but did not get hired after it. 
“It would be easier if the Work-Study Job Fair was a little bit later and not so early in the year,” Ong said. “I know a lot of people miss it because it’s so early, and they don’t hear about it fast enough.”
Lori Shreve Blake, senior director for career engagement at the Career Center, said on-campus offices that hire students are personally responsible for registering for the Work-Study Job Fair and for posting available positions on connectSC. 
“We’re going to encourage all of the on-campus offices to — in addition to registering for the fair — post their jobs on connectSC,” Shreve Blake said. “I’m expecting improvements in that area.”
Shreve Blake said she also encourages students to broaden their horizons when searching for jobs at USC and to extend their search to  the USC Hotel, USC Credit Union, USC Hospitality, USC Housing and the libraries. 
There are also job opportunities further from the heart of campus. Some students turn to off-campus jobs, such as shops in USC Village, remote internships and jobs in the University Park area. Numerous businesses created by USC students such as Duffl, Handle and UniBud hire primarily fellow USC students.
“[On-campus jobs are] definitely more limited than we often believe them to be,” Croft said. “There are some jobs on campus that are easier to attain … that hire a lot of students, but the community service centers and help desks hire a very limited number of students, and it’s hard to get a job through them.”

The corner of Figueroa Street and Vernon Avenue welcomed many on a cold Sunday night. Despite the rain, the mass of people waiting to have their orders taken proved the tacos at Tacos Los Carnalillos food truck were a necessity.
Approximately eight minutes from USC’s campus lies one of the best taco spots in Los Angeles. Apart from the ambiance and attention to efficiency, the food is astounding. Deemed “Ross Tacos” by many, Tacos Los Carnalillos has honed in on how to make a great-tasting taco under all conditions. 
Upon arriving, one is deceived by the flashing signs advertising “Ross Dress for Less” and “Mega Coin Laundry.” However, the smell of al pastor and the loud crowd quickly draw any and all attention. As you make your way toward the corner of the parking lot, you realize why the parking lot was full despite all stores in the shopping center being closed. 
Families and friends make up the crowd of people waiting to order. At first glance, the length of the line seems rather demoralizing. However, as you wait you realize that you find yourself moving quicker than anticipated. What seemed like a colossal line quickly turned out to be a mere illusion as you are at the front in under 10 minutes. 
The minimalist menu was clear and attractive, advertising the best dishes with pictures. Asada, al pastor, carnitas and chicharon are all offered in a variety of options ranging from tacos to nachos. Buche, pollo, birria, cabeza, chorizo, tripas and lengua, tend to be the more attractive choices when it comes to burritos, tortas and mulitas. 
With the tacos priced at $2 and the mullitas at $4, the Tacos Los Carnalillos food truck is a no-brainer. What truly makes the tacos on the corner of Figueroa Street and Vernon Avenue unique is the al pastor that comes from this massive hunk of meat kabab style being cooked by flame. At first sight, the meat seems intimidating almost, but surely you’re convinced as you see the cook cut a few pieces off to make an order of tacos. 
The Figeruoa and Vernon location is one of three locations that host a Tacos Los Carnalillos food truck. The other two are 4403 S. Figueroa St. and 110 W. Imperial Hwy. With a fourth location currently in the works, it is safe to say that Tacos Los Carnalillos is establishing its reign in South Central. Opening the doors for business at 10:30 a.m. and closing at 1 a.m. Monday through Friday and at 3 a.m. Saturday and Sunday has proven to be beneficial for business. Many reviews on Yelp describe Tacos Los Carnalillos as ideal for late-night taco runs, and this sentiment proves to be true. The hours being as open as they are provide guests with a sense of security when looking for a viable option despite the time of day.  
Some of the truck’s must-haves include tacos, mulitas and burritos. Being some of the most popular items ordered, Tacos Los Carnalillos have mastered flavor in simplicity. With the burrito containing beans, onions, cheese and a choice of meat, and the tacos and mulitas containing nothing more than meat and cheese, it’s safe to say that people don’t come for something special. In other words, the truck focuses on the likings of its customers and caters to creating something worth trying. For this reason, customers from all over the greater Los Angeles area stand in the rain waiting to order. 
The truck’s strongest trait comes in the form of the meat choice of al pastor. With its known popularity, Tacos Los Carnalillos has been known to prepare 200-pound chunks of meat on the same rotating iron rod specifically for the weekend. The meat itself is juicy, savory and well seasoned, so much so that the meat tastes amazing with little to no added ingredients — salsa, lime, onions, etc. 
Overall, the food that comes from Tacos Los Carnalillos food truck speaks for itself. The simplicity of the restaurant makes the food the most convincing factor. Speaking for the number of people present on a cold, rainy L.A. Sunday, people seem to be convinced.

Danial Asaria and Reese Bretow created AI Cover Letter in an effort to harness the power of artificial intelligence to help students who are applying for jobs and internships. The website drastically shortens the process of writing a personalized cover letter to just 30 seconds. 
The students were inspired to create the website after they spent a significant amount of time writing cover letters for internship applications. They realized that this was not efficient, especially since recruiters simply look for keywords and skim through, Bretow said. 
“It’s very frustrating spending 10 to 20 minutes writing a cover letter that I knew was not going to really be read,” said Bretow, a junior majoring in business administration. “I wondered if this could be automated, so I texted Danial.”
Friends before creating AI Cover Letter, Asaria and Bretow knew how to divide responsibilities to make their goal possible. While Asaria coded the website, Bretow designed its interface. The website requires the user to upload their resume and paste the job description and role they are applying for. It then extracts information from both these inputs to produce a cover letter. The most important aspect of the software is that it matches the job description to the relevant parts of the resume to make a story. 
The website was built upon OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, a generative model that allows for text completion, and then trained for cover letters. The model first picks the correct prompts and then scans the resume so it can dissect it and find the important parts. To train it, the creators used cover letters from an open forum at USC, their own cover letters and online examples that hiring managers said they liked best. 
AI Cover Letter has had more than 3,400 visits since its launch. While the website is open to anyone who is in the process of a writing cover letter, current users are mainly undergraduate students at USC. 
“We are undergraduate college students, so the people we sent it to happen to be the same,” said Asaria, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration. “But anyone who’s applying [for] a job can use this website.”
Rushikesh Pande, a junior majoring in neuroscience, and Josh Cohen, a sophomore majoring in business administration, praised the app for its simplicity and said they would recommend it to others. 
“The ease of use is definitely something that is helpful,” Pande said. “This was a lot easier because you can copy and paste any job description … you don’t have to do too much.”
Cohen said he often uses it as a baseline for a cover letter and then edits it to better fit his needs, rather than starting from scratch. 
“I edited it obviously,you got to proofread it to make sure it’s talking about what you want it to talk about,” Cohen said. “Most of it was pretty solid and I didn’t need to change a bunch.”
ChatGPT is another popular model using GPT-3 that can write cover letters quickly. However, AI Cover Letter already does the key steps of sorting the resume, prioritizing information, choosing the correct prompts and training on cover letters. Hence, the creators argue that it is more efficient than ChatGPT.
“As a product designer, it’s important to make products that work really well and fast,” Bretow said. “While ChatGPT could get you something similar with the right fine-tuning of the prompts, that’s an extra layer of effort I strive not to have.”
While Cohen hasn’t used ChatGPT for his cover letter, he is unsure if it can import the same data as AI Cover Letter, which is specifically made for this purpose. Compared to this, users may have to edit more to make sure ChatGPT gave the cover letter tailored to the job.  
While USC didn’t help in the development of this website in any official capacity, Asaria and Bretow said they learned skills from their classes and organizations that inspired leadership. According to them, the innovation culture at USC is underrated and the university’s startup culture is not as well-known as that of other schools. This, however, does not stop students from making interesting projects here.
“It’s really exciting to see what’s going to be coming out of here and what already has,” Bretow said.

Where do you see yourself five years from now? Where do you see yourself in 10?
Honestly, I don’t. If there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s to “expect the unexpected.” And God do I wish it wasn’t the case.
What went so wrong that I can’t imagine what life would look like a few years from now? Hell, I don’t even think I can see myself a few weeks from now. But if I were to imagine, I would like to imagine myself okay. Not happy, but okay. Because there’s nothing more I could really ask for. And to me, okay is waking up to find that the world isn’t ending (or maybe not yet). And that’s okay. I’ll be okay. How relieving is it to know that the fate of the world doesn’t rest on your shoulders? That’s one less burden to carry, and hopefully less back pain as well. Maybe back pain doesn’t make it okay after all…
If I could turn back the clock, I don’t think I would. After all, I don’t know of a life that isn’t my own. Sure I could imagine — I could spend my days lost in thought, thinking of a life that is and isn’t mine. Maybe I could bring people back from the dead. Tell [him] not to go on that ski trip. One that would be his last. But that wouldn’t make me who I am today. The pain of losing someone — a morbid reminder of our own mortality — it’s only made me more human. It made me not stronger, but more gentle — not guarded, but vulnerable. Because when life takes and takes, you get tired. Tired of the pain, of the late nights sobbing. Tired of being sad. So you take back what little time you have. Out of all of the possible timelines we could be living in, we were lucky enough to share this fleeting moment together. And even if just for a moment, it seems our souls have touched one another, like a stain on your favorite hoodie. The one you hold dear and wear when the world seems just a bit too cold.
At the end of the day, or rather at the end of all time, when the last star dies and we reach the inevitable heat death of the universe (yikes!), our lives are nothing but an insignificant afterthought in the vast ocean of existence. So when the waves come crashing down, and it feels like you can’t breathe, let go. Because we are the universe experiencing itself. We are silly little atoms and subatomic particles that got together and decided to be. To be conscious. To be alive. To be matter (haha physics joke) and to matter. 
So I will continue to pursue this sinful, hedonistic life. I will be living, loving and laughing. I will continue to fuck around and find out. Because when life is so insignificant, so devoid of meaning, it is up to us to find our own. And maybe you don’t want to go to Hell. Maybe you want to lead a virtuous life, to work hard and to make an honest living. Don’t get me wrong but I sure as hell don’t. People are so complex, so much more than the model citizen, model student, model anything. Because there is no model. We cannot fit into something that doesn’t exist, something arbitrarily designed by dead people before us. Because who cares about them? They’ve had their time, and the present is now yours.
If there’s a common denominator in all the reasons I decided NOT to kill myself, it’s spite. Spiteful of a world that is so indifferent and unforgiving. Spiteful to be born, to live and to survive. So I will do it. I will live and do it out of spite. And I’ll make a lot of friends (and maybe even enemies), I’ll make the world rue giving the speck of dust that is my life. In five years I will still be throwing ass. In 10 years, I will be suffering from the consequences of my actions (even more back pain) at the ripe, old age of 32. But regardless, I refuse to waste my time. Waste my chances and opportunities. In my 22 years of life, I’ve had so much taken, so much lost and so much never had. But instead of dwelling on the what if’s and on what could be, I live and die today.
So don’t kill yourself — you’re too sexy. Live your life, and live it differently.

The No. 6 seed USC Trojans fell to the No. 11 seed Oregon State Beavers 48-56 in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament at Michelob ULTRA Arena in Las Vegas. The underdog Beavers, who only won four regular season conference games, seemed to outmatch the five-point favorite Trojans the entire game. 
“Credit to them, and they earned that win, they were better than us in virtually every way,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a postgame press conference. “It was the type of game that they wanted to play more than it was the type of game we wanted to play.”
The game was neck and neck in the first half, with the Trojans holding a mere one-point lead going into the half. The Beavers were shooting a poor 29.6% from the floor, but the Trojans were shooting an even worse 28.6% from the field.
“I thought we were playing pretty undisciplined with our shot selection from tip to horn. I think they had a game plan defensively … and we played right into their hands by taking some early not so great shots,” Gottlieb said. “The way we played on offense was not how we practiced this week.”
In the second-half, the game was full of runs. The Trojans jumped out to a 7-point lead, but the Beavers went on an 11-0 run to erase that deficit and take a four-point lead. In the fourth quarter, Oregon State sealed the game with free throws. The Beavers shot an excellent 19-21 from the free-throw line, with the Trojans only making five of their eight attempts in the entire game.
“Obviously the free-throw line, if you look at the numbers … that is a huge differentiating factor,” Gottlieb said. “We made more field goals and more threes. But I think when it came down to it, the game never felt like it was the way we wanted to feel.” 
Graduate guard Destiny Littleton, the Trojans’ second-leading scorer and court general on offense, struggled throughout the game. Littleton ended the game with 12 points shooting 3-15 from the field. This is Littleton’s 25th time scoring in double digits this season.
“I think personally [I need to work on] shot selection,” said Littleton in an emotional postgame press conference. “I mean it’s a lot of pressure that is on my shoulders and just making sure that the team sticks together, stays together, but I do have the ball in my hands a lot and just recognizing when a good shot is a good shot and a bad shot is a bad shot.”
One bright spot for the Trojans was graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, who continued her team-leading in points per game. Sissoko led the team in points again, dropping 16 on the Beavers. This is Sissoko’s fourth consecutive game in double digits.
Finishing the regular season 21-9, the Trojans are hopeful they will be dancing in March.
“I dont think it’s [the loss] indicative of the year that we’ve had and obviously grateful that I think we have more basketball in front of us to have a chance to play this feeling out of ourselves,” Gottlieb said.
Before USC’s first round loss, they were a projected 10-seed in the NCAA women’s basketball tournament according to ESPN’s Charlie Creme. With the Trojans’ resume and four Quad 1 wins against No. 6 Stanford, No. 20 Colorado and two against Washington State, they will have a good shot to compete against 67 other teams for their 17th NCAA tournament appearance.
“I just think we have to look back at this game and do some soul searching and just figure out who we want to be in the tournament,” Littleton said. “Moving forward this in between time is kind of weird, you don’t know who you’re going to play, but you have to stay in the gym and do a mental reset.”
To prepare for the madness of March, Gottlieb made it clear to reset after this game and said it’s her job to get the women prepared for battle.
“That translation from practice to the game is my job to hold them accountable to that and that’s what we have to do,” Gottlieb said.
The Trojans main focus the whole season has been on their defense, as this was only the second time of the year that the Trojans lost when holding opponents to 58 or fewer points. USC leads the Pac-12 in scoring defense, holding opponents to only 54.83 points per game.
“I wholeheartedly believe that we do have more basketball to go,” Littleton said. “I think we could really make a good run in the tournament.”
The Trojans now await the NCAA tournament selection show to see if they have more basketball left to play, which will air at 5 p.m. on Sunday, March 12 on ESPN.

No. 8 men’s tennis took down UCLA Wednesday afternoon in Westwood, extending the Trojans’ win streak against their crosstown rival to seven consecutive duals and improving to 8-3 on the season. 
“It’s always just fun playing UCLA. At ours, theirs, wherever we can play them,” said graduate student Bradley Frye. “This is the last time I will be here playing, so that is always really fun.”
Wednesday’s victory marks the second time this season that the Trojans have swept the Bruins 4-0 with their first victory coming during a home match back on Jan. 29 during ITA Kickoff Weekend. 
“Any time you get to play and beat the Bruins is a good day,” said Head Coach Brett Masi. “Our guys came ready to play and we took care of business, so we’re just happy with that.”
Despite playing in the wind and the cold, the Trojans started out the match with a swift victory at the doubles point. They got wins on court one from No. 17 pair senior Stefan Dostanic and Frye and on court three from sophomore Wojtek Marek and senior Samuel Rubell. The victory was the first time the Trojans had won the doubles point since their previous match against UCLA, snapping a six-game losing streak.
“Our guys just came out and they did the things that we can do well, which for doubles is making a lot of first shots and I felt like we did that pretty well,” Masi said. “Especially at one and three doubles, we took care of our serves and made a lot of good first serves, and when we had the chance to break we did.”
With the doubles point under their belt, the Trojans made quick work in their singles matches. The Trojans scored points on straight-set victories from junior Lodewijk Weststrate on court six and Frye on court five before sophomore Peter Makk clinched in straight sets on court two.
“We haven’t been able to play a lot of points, just because the last two weeks the weather has been really crummy. We just talked about playing a little bit more basic, playing a little bit more aggressively,” Masi said. “We played pretty well in doubles and had three steady singles matches, so I am happy with that.”
Wednesday’s match marked the first action the Trojans had seen since they returned from the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Chicago earlier this month, where the Trojans made it to the quarterfinals before falling to No. 2 Kentucky. The Trojans paired their defeat with a loss to No. 11 Georgia in the tournament’s consolation round. 
“I’m looking forward to just competing with the guys during practice and growing from here,” Frye said. “We had a tough one the last two matches before this, so I think ending this with the dub is exciting, and hopefully we can keep this going.” 
The ITA Championship capped off a long road trip for the Trojans, who had lost at Michigan before heading to the tournament.
“It was definitely really weird because we were gone for maybe nine or 10 days, so I think coming back and kind of getting into the grind of outdoor tennis [was important],” Frye said. “It was good for everyone to just get their school done and get everything situated and get ready for today, and I think we did a great job and the result shows.”
Going into the rest of the season, the Trojans are hoping to capitalize on this victory to keep their momentum strong.
“Honestly, we have just got to start gearing up for the rest of the season, with the matches that are coming up, and then what’s lying ahead later in March,” Masi said. “Each day we are trying to get one percent better, and honestly, today is awesome and we are going to feel good about that, but we are just trying to inch and inch and inch to get better every day.
The Trojans’ next match will be at home against Baylor on March 10 at 5 p.m.

The NCAA just got a new leader and the climate of college sports could be in store for some major changes.
From the debate over whether or not student athletes should receive full-time compensation for their work to cementing consistent name, image and likeness (NIL) rules across college sports by getting the House and Senate involved, former Massachusetts governor and now president of the NCAA Charlie Baker will have his work cut out for him. The future of college sports is at a crossroads like never before, and could evolve to more of a professional game than an amateur one over the next couple of years. 
There are plenty of conversations we could have about paying athletes, who work their tails off for their universities and deserve to get a slice of the pie just like all other employees of athletic departments. But instead of focusing on the primary interests of Baker and the NCAA, let’s talk about one that might fly under the radar in much of the early reporting of Baker’s takeover. 
What will it mean for the NCAA’s contributions to the fight against climate change? 
The former Republican governor, who left office with a high approval rating in the Democratic state of Massachusetts, has made efforts to curb climate change in the past. He should continue the fight while leading the $1 billion industry that is the NCAA.
Just a matter of months ago, Baker signed a major bill that won the approval of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit “fighting for a safer and healthier world,” according to their website. With a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the bill encouraged the development of offshore wind and solar energy and limited the usage of fossil fuels in construction, among other climate-friendly implementations.
When Baker first took over as governor of Massachusetts in 2015, the state was among the most eco-friendly states in the country. During his eight years in office, Massachusetts has remained in the forefront of combating climate change, now rated as the sixth-most environmentally friendly state in the U.S. and No. 2 in climate change contributions.
March Madness approaches, in turn likely bringing in a hefty majority of the NCAA’s yearly earnings (the basketball tournament accounted for a whopping 85% of the organizations’ record-breaking $1.16 billion 2021 earnings). Along with the tournament that features what I consider to be the greatest weekend in sports, comes a swarm of carbon emissions for which the NCAA must be held accountable.
A study from the Journal of Cleaner Production of the 2019 NCAA tournament found that the combination of team and fan travel, food, waste, lodging and stadium operations produced approximately 210,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. 
The average American produces around 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide, meaning that the NCAA Tournament has the same carbon footprint as around 10,500 people. The sheer amount of travel required to put on the colossal clash accounted for nearly 80% of that number.
The study concluded by emphasizing the need for mega sports tourism events, like March Madness or the FIFA World Cup, to find ways to be more sustainable — while admitting that sustainability comes at a, quite literal, cost.
The 2023 Final Four was advertised as a “beacon of environmental wellness, equity and resiliency,” according to the Final Four in Houston website.
Their focus areas were recycling/repurposing signage effectively, donating reusable items such as basketballs and leftover food and waste reduction and proper disposal of garbage.
These actions seem performative and not nearly enough to offset the massive carbon footprint that the tournament produces. Recycling is a complicated process and isn’t nearly as effective or climate-friendly as it is made out to be. Donating basketballs and leftover food is great, but a pretty negligible contribution to the tourney’s carbon footprint.
Where the NCAA should focus its efforts is limiting travel — something that the move to the Big Ten by USC and UCLA will make difficult for the organization, as the schools’ carbon footprints are about to skyrocket with the long cross country flights. 
Should brackets be designed by region? Should the tournament take place in one or two locations instead of 14? Well, I wasn’t recently inducted as the sixth president of the NCAA, so it’s not my call.
Charlie Baker, you’re up. I’ll be on my couch, sweating out my “USC to make the Sweet Sixteen” future.
