The Black Student Assembly, Program Board, and the Undergraduate Student Government wish for the welfare, health, and recovery of everyone impacted by the incident of October 31, 2012.  The intent of the event was to create a safe, secure, and alcohol-free environment on campus for students on the night of Halloween. We did not foresee the tragedy that would transpire. Our organizations are working with the university administration to actively prevent such a misfortune from reoccurring in the future.
These are times of hardship not only for the Trojan family but also for communities well beyond the boundaries of USC’s campus; it is therefore critical that we hold one another accountable while also taking great care not to denounce the members of our own community. Condemning one another will only further stratify and marginalize our family at a time when we each need harmony, support, and encouragement. We especially ask all Trojans to be cautious of isolating and targeting your fellow students, many of whose very lives have been affected by the incidents.
For decades, USC’s Black Student Assembly has executed its mission of developing leadership, educating its members, fostering community, and service to others. The assembly is a major voice and resource for African American students at USC, and its activity over the years illuminates the strength of diversity for both current and future students at USC. From hosting hundreds of college applicants at our annual Multicultural Overnight, to working with dozens of high school students on college applications, to hosting formal affairs recognizing the brilliant achievements of its members, and much more, it continues to provide value to the university’s devotion to academia, diversity, and public service.
The act of one individual outside of our event, is not a reflection of our purpose. Responses to the incident, however, are an indication that BSA’s service to the USC community is far from complete.
In moving forward, the Black Student Assembly has decided to suspend hosting parties and other socially driven events for the remainder of the semester. Instead, BSA will focus its energy on cultural programming and providing immediate relief, recovery, and long-term reform at the University of Southern California.  Program Board will also increase the scrutiny placed on outside organizations during the review process of co-sponsorship. Our efforts are first and foremost to serve the USC student body, while at the same time fostering an inclusive community in adherence to the USC strategic vision.  We believe that in doing so, our organizations fulfill their efforts of providing the best undergraduate experience for all USC students.
Nothing to Fear, thank you for asking for clarification.  It appears to me that the assumptions by much of the public and media is that the shooting happened because USC is located in South Central L.A.  We disagree and think that this assumption significantly damages USC’s reputation and defeats the progress that USC has made in securing the campus.  It appears that this shooting happened on the USC campus because social media marketing and this particular event drew the shooter and victims to the USC campus.  
Personally, this Trojan family disagrees with the students, parents and other members of the community who are calling for a closed campus or for USC to move to a “safer” location.   Nowhere is safe from the risks of social media (not even Haren, Netherlands).  Walls need to be taken down, not built up.
Thank you for elaborating.  And I love your comment as I am in complete agreement and would want likewise.  It’s great that there are others out there not so quick to capitulate!
But today is a sad day that the (in my opinion) university has given into fear, with not just its policies but the position that imbues the policies, feeling that a never-ending implementation of isolating procedures is needed to buttress the neighborhood’s social-economic status.
As you pointed out, it was the effects of social media gone awry — and possibly-or-probably the promoter and those at USC authorizing the event.  Yet, the remedies (the support of science of blood-letting as cure) falls on the Trojan community and the larger surrounding community.
All this (policies/procedures) will have done is to create fear and suspicion and reward superstition of the most base kind.
Yes, we are in agreement, and I thank you for the opportunity to clarify that.
I am still digesting NIkias’ response.  He says they will beef up security—isn’t there already ample security/police presence?  DPS/LAPD seem to always be in sight.   And from the DPS reports I have seen, they have a remarkable record of catching perpetrators, including the Halloween shooter.
I agree as well. The shooter was drawn onto campus seemingly due to laxity implementing existing policy. USC admins seemingly did not check the background and rave offering of this promotor. Students invited a high risk individual onto campus. No students who might have seen the Twan tweets inviting outsiders apparently exercised a sense of protectiveness for USC and also turned a blind eye. Both factors likely led to no outside promotion allowed. I regret the closed campus, but given the number of violent incidents in the past year, this seems unfortunately necessary to preserve USC’s integrity as a safe campus, at least to the outside world observing. 
Perhaps this enforced turning in will finally bring a period of reflection and discussion about what the optimal social venues are for USC undergraduate and graduate students and a concerted effort for all to work together to continue to elevate the social, along with the academic stature, of USC.
In response to Nothing to Fear’s comment,
I sincerely appreciate your efforts to  “correct and unpack all the added commentary to the story. ”  But I suggest that you drill down further.   On the day after the shooting, I did my own research (ah, the power of the internet!), and suspected the shooting was a gang hit.  This has now been confirmed.  Per the national media, police are stating that the shooting was gang-related.   Yes, the hit could have happened anywhere (check out rioting that occurred in Haren, Netherlands when a 16 year old posted a public invitation to her party on Facebook).  But the shooting happened on the USC campus because of a lack of understanding of LA Hype’s market and other big mistakes in judgment.  I have no doubt that the BSA and USC leadership realize this  They now owe the good people of the BSA and the rest of the Trojan community accountability and appropriate corrective action.  And in the bigger picture, and for the benefit of the school and surrounding neighborhood’s reputation, the conclusion that the shooting happened because of USC’s location needs to be corrected.
Thanks for your comment.  However, I was unsure of the intent of your last sentence.
A final point to add:
Whether one embraces, agrees or disputes– USC’s “party school” reputation is firmly established in the media and broadcast worldwide. Here is a sampling:
From “Betches Love This”

From “LA Weekly”

USC social life, “boring,” as attempted to be portrayed in recent comments? Seems more a poorly executed, transparent pr attempt in response to the Row’s perennial problems. From last year’s Daily Trojan:http://dailytrojan.com/2011/04/04/the-row-in-need-of-reform/
And this year’s Daily Trojan:
http://dailytrojan.com/2012/09/19/row-imposes-social-ban-amid-university-concerns/ 
Of particular note is this comment from the 2011 DT article: 
“The fact that Jackson and others feel the policy now needs to be enforced means Greeks no longer enjoy a favorable “blind eye” from the university”.
Two concerns are apparent: 
(1) The USC admin “blind eye” again seem “wide shut” with regard to a minimum of due diligence regarding the promotor or type of “party” (rave) the weeknight exemption at Tutor Center was offered for.
(2) The Row is not the lilly white social alternative as it has had its share of problems and continues to into 2012 (see fight and arrest inside a Row fraternity house reported in today’s DT Roundup).
My call is for the entire Trojan Family to focus careful attention on evaluating openly the current social and party atmosphere at USC. Is it in keeping with the stature of a Top 25 and rising school? Are we inviting those looking for a “party school” atmosphere either to exploit commercially or to join? Is USC meeting the social needs of the high caliber undergraduate and graduate students we are attracting and want to continue to attract?   
I am enormously impressed with the rapid rise and justifiable academic stature USC has recently attained. I look forward to the day USC earns equal recognition for its social offerings. Both are necessary to maintain the interest and attendance of the best and brightest students and support of their parents.

It saddens me to see a lot of these posts. I hope the students on my campus aren’t as culturally insensitive as their “Trojan Parents”. If you do not want your children to go here, please do us all a favor and make them transfer. Disbanding the BSA, firing Michael Jackson, or attempting to ban all outsiders from entering campus will NOT make this a safer campus or world. If you have not taught your children to deal with the complexities and dangers of the REAL WORLD then I suggest you do so before they graduate. The BSA made a mistake in hosting an event with LAHype and they have acknowledged that. Let’s just pray for those that were affected and thank God that no Trojans were hurt.
If there was one comment, one response that could be highlighted as to what we should think, what we should feel, and how we should act, I wish it were the above comment.  It is simple.  It is concise.  It is absolutely correct.  And it is absolutely merited.
Great post!
Seems like “ghettobirds” (terrible name, by the way) aren’t the only helicopters around here.
Really Concerned Student? Four people shot in a gang-related shooting in the middle of campus merits just an “oops sorry” and that’s it?  No further investigation or consequences?  It is not “culturally insensitive” to get the facts and take steps to reduce the future likelihood of a similar event.  On the contrary, it would be irresponsible not to do so. 
BTW this Trojan family does not agree with blaming the neighborhood, disbanding the BSA or trying to shut down the campus.
Where is it proven that this is gang-related?
Concerned student isn’t trying to deflect blame. She’s/He’s trying to a) simply encourage a reaction and nothing more, especially the heap of garbage in these comments, b) hold those responsible for their actions, and c) get people to understand that these events are anomalies and that USC has a good amount of patrolling and safety measures in place. In addition, the post is dead on: this is the real world, and this event could have happened anywhere. Policy was violated somewhere. All these exaggerations of transferring are ridiculous, especially if parents are forcing it.
There are too many hysterical-shrill comments from parents and having to correct and unpack all the added commentary to the story is becoming frustrating, infuriating and burdensome.
Assumptions everywhere and not a correct statement to be found: this was not a gang-hit; USC is not the definitive, archetypal party school (“Coachella, Burning man and Mardi Gras rolled into one”); the community is not a larger-than-life pool of criminals and miscreants; the area does not have the potential to become a rolling, bucolic wonderland (of one’s youth) if it were not for the dastardly university administration; and other tired canards, littering the comments.
Enough already!
What is it with this “all or nothing” thinking, as if anyone is advocating “[n]o further investigation or consequences”?  This was an unfortunate event!  Everyone at USC is concerned about productivity and results; no parent needs to worry about that!  This hyper-activism on the behalf of parents (in these comments) is stultifying: Events (negative) that have occurred in the last 5 years and today are no more probable than the distant past; if anything, the University continues to improve in selecting policies that enable a safer campus; but there would not be an ability for improvement if perfection were already in hand, would there?!
My problem with the administrators is that not one of them (e.g., Michael Jackson) who approved this “alcohol-free” nightclub event in the middle of campus has taken personal responsibility for a grave lapse in judgment.  He and they should have simply done a few clicks of on-line research to understand the promoters with which they were dealing.  They wrongly presumed that college students would not pre-party or drink alcohol prior to the event (as many underage college students do), they ignored the likelihood that non-USC students and non-college students would crash the party (again, as many kids at that age do), they failed to obtain  beefed-up security for a large dance event (as nightclubs that cater to college students do), they failed to consider the risks involved with making an exception to the “no parties” after 10 p.m. on school nights rule (a wise rule in retrospect), and they failed to prepare handling an overflow crowd jockeying for admission (thank goodness the shooter did not open fire in Tutor Center).  Michael Jackson (and perhaps others) made an egregious mistake that resulted in four people being shot on-campus, blood being spilled, and USC’s image being badly tarnished.  Parents are justifiably and reasonably concerned about their children’s safety and outraged by the administration’s failure to protect them; accordingly, he must now suffer the consequences by resigning and/or being fired.  He screwed up and must go.  There is no room for debate here.
The posture taken by Nikias and Jackson thus far has been to defer and deflect. While they may require time to consider policy changes, a sincere apology to parents and students for obvious oversights in judgement and responsibility are long overdo. For some, the window of contrition may have closed already for Nikias and Jackson which will make a tough road ahead for them. Theirs has been a curious, if not bizarre, response to the Trojan Family.
The answer is simple, close off USC to non-students and allow DPS to escort any trespassers off campus. It’s sad to say, but you basically have to create a security environment that says, “this is not part of the city – this is a private university and only invited guests are welcome” to curtail these types of tragedies. YES, that means profiling. The hardworking parents who pay $50+K/year don’t expect their kids to get hit with stray gunfire IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPUS.  Not blocks away, not across the street – the middle of the campus! It’s absurd. Also, no more joint parties with shady outside groups on campus. HypeLA? Really?? That’s the name of the organization you’re going to allow to have a private party on campus? Someone should lose their job over this.
1982 Alumnus, Another USC Parent, Herman, Frances,
I appreciate all of your postings to this site and hope that you are writing/emailing the USC President’s Office also.
Our students were not endangered by the surrounding neighborhood “creeping” in.
The danger was INVITED on campus.   USC needs to take responsibility for failure to understand the type of event , the reach of social media and of the seediness of LA Hype and their disgusting promo video/ads. 
I struggled to allow my son to attend USC due to the cost and party school reputation.  Did we make  a mistake in allowing him to go there?   I am watching closely to see how the university handles this and awaiting their policy changes.  I think that the President should give the community specific facts and describe all of the circumstances that led to four people being shot in the middle of campus.  I recommend town hall meetings and campus education initiatives to educate students— their irresponsible behavior can make a laughingstock of their USC education.
Excellent post New Trojan Parent. The larger concern is that their is a social/party atmosphere at USC such that students apparently thought they were in keeping with the party norm to invite LA Hype to campus, reinforced by USC admin approved. No one of the many various students who knew of the character of this rave planned or its morphing to a open party sounded an alarm. 
Meanwhile, many other USC students stayed in their dorm to avoid this type of party. It was their Halloween as well and their campus to socialize on. It appears there are many fewer options for the socially and academically highly qualified students who are looking for something other than what earns USC a national “Party School” reputation. Your suggestion of town hall meetings and campus initiatives is excellent. I suggest, also, students be surveyed to determine if their needs are being met with the current social scene at USC. Perhaps modifications or additions are necessary, as well as greater sophistication and seeming interest in the social needs and desires of students beyond Greek Thursday/Saturday parties.
Nope. This is NOT a party school.  
I have 10 years with USC.  I am a graduate of USC and have been around innumerable other campuses and can see a stark difference in other schools that care much less about “performance.”
Instead of relying upon 3rd party entities to detail the “reputation”, you should visit this campus more, gain more experience and see how dull it can be!  Yes, this is a big campus (lots of students) and it is vast in its amenities and events.  But that does not mean it is a party school!
But that is not the real problem, is it?  Rather, this event (shooting) affords many their ability to reflect their true nature, their inner demons of fear!   
The real problem is fear: the administration fear of the future; the administration fear for the wrath parents would bring if life ushers another unforeseen or unfortunate event; the administration fear of not improving upon gains of predecessors or losing status.  
The parents fear the loss of protection to an “over-protected” child.  And the students (as not yet full-adults) take all the sympathy and attention that this “news” gives them, as they are no doubt getting much from parents and other classmates, so there is something to gossip about.
This is really reflective of the state of our country (and it sucks): Fear of the bogeyman.  
An ugly, tragic event that happened this Halloween (for THE victims) is not in question.  But be forewarned of a greater tragedy, impacting a larger number of victims as we live under this rubric of fear–because how do some people love their fear!
A future where USC Trojans are no longer recognizable as they are turned into the monsters that lurk within each of us as a result of fear — the future of becoming a “weak, timid, and ineffectual person.”  A wimp. 
THIS IS NOT WHAT BECOMING A TROJAN IS ABOUT!
Dear NothingTFBFI,
You are bizarrely off base and seem to have some more generalized, personal issues with society you are confabulating with the USC shooting.
Many parents are highly successful professionals and businesspersons quite capable of recognizing responsible and effective problem solving and leadership. Inviting a rave by this promotor to the Tutor Center for Halloween was fraught with perceivable risk. It also calls into question whether a heavily promoted by video butt on crotch event is desirable for the sole Halloween party at our Tutor Center. 
As far as USC being boring given the nature of its Thursday and Saturday Row Greek parties, you must be comparing USC to Coachella, Burning man and Mardi Gras rolled into one. 
Overprotectiveness? Nope, just an expectation for a quality social atmosphere consistent with a top 25 and rising university.
The party’s organization was a mistake.  The mistake needs to be accounted for and corrected.  However, too many broad generalizations are being made from that mistake. 
And those generalizations are akin to conflating “something reminiscent” the football team and its supposed “loss of institutional control” with a similar demeanor that exists generally within the institution itself.  
The mistake is an isolated event that needs to be looked into and appropriate recommendations and actions need to be implemented.  But that is it.  It is not reflective of the institution.  There is “no loss of control” within the institution (as it appears to be hinted at in comments to these articles).  
A crazed-madman bringing a gun onto campus says nothing, other than that a crazed-madman brought a gun onto campus.
But given your deep concerns, why don’t you present a solution as to how the campus should protect itself differently (from crazed madmen), given its location.  Because nothing significantly has changed regarding its urban location, residing within the 2nd largest city in the US, for some time.  
And to add, no matter how you try to redefine the problem, you should understand that such a person as the assailant, would be able to enter campus at any time.  It is not like USC is hidden and no one knows where it is located, and if it were not for this party promoter, it would never have been “discovered.”
The guy was a crazed-madman!
Look, we know there’s risk, and those that brought this on should be reviewed. However, making such a false blanket statement that USC is a “party school” is just stupid, especially if you’re only considering LA Hype as evidence (one event). There may be sections that party, but you will find as much or as little partying as you like here. Pretty much every school is a party school – you just need to choose your scene and the amount – don’t single out USC on this one event. As an alumni, I am well aware of the scenes and the rigorous academics I chose to pursue that landed me with a very successful company.
And for some to blame the surrounding neighborhood is just plain ignorant. See the example of the shooting on 29th last year: the man involved was from far, far south of our campus. I challenge anyone to provide facts of all USC incidents and where the aggressors are from – you want to blame our next door neighbors? Prove it.
As students, USC, if nothing else, taught us how to be more aware of our surroundings. We can’t control the world around us, but we can decide what we get into and how we must respond.
“reoccurring” is not a word; I believe you meant “recurring.”  Sheesh, is this what USC is teaching?
Inviting 1500 community college/no college individuals to center campus on a school night who were instructed how to pregame doesn’t sound like a bad idea?  Not to mention this whole event was for profit at a Top 25 University. Congratulations on tarnishing your school’s reputation.  Obviously USC is to blame as well but the whole premise of this event is ludacrous, selfish, and greedy.
Herman,
You mention a most significant concern. USC has rapidly risen to Top academic 25 status, its social offering to students have not. Perhaps this is just a delay in development, but it needs to be addressed  by USC admins, faculty, alums, students and student organizations with urgency. Either the social offerings rise to meet the academic, or USC’s academic standing will fall as students look elsewhere for a fun, lively, sophisticated academic and social environment.
A “rave”, butt on crotch grind for our students for Halloween? Top 25? I think not. An invitation for danger, inviting a seedy night club atmosphere onto the heart of campus? Obviously. Yet, admins were clueless as if social media was not their purview for review, only posters. Anyone in the administration could have and should have Googled LA Hype at USC before approving an exemption and seen LA Hypes eye-popping video of grossly inappropriate behavior for Halloween at the Tutor Center.
And what of the students who knew did view the video and knew exactly who/what was coming to the heart of the USC campus? What of the students who saw the tweets inviting non-students for a fee and the “pregame” comment? What of the Greeks who have posted thus far seeming trying to enhance their yet-to-be-redeemed reputation at the BSA’s sole expense. It was only two months ago Greek parties were shut down for fights on house lawns, being drunk in public and noise complaints. The USC admin response published–“stay inside–out of sight”. The parade of spandex from dorms to the Row resumes. Greeks most certainly knew of this party, the morphing to an open party and the dark atmosphere LA Live brings. 
My point is much soul searching needs to be done and no finger pointing other to ones self. USC has well-earned a “party reputation”, #2 in the 2012 Playboy ranking. The #1 school, U 0f Virginia admins disavowed the reputation, noting their history and academic programs. USC admins have been silent. 
As a parent, I am limited to visits and USC’s fine media, DailyTrojan  and Neon Tommy, for information and perspective. The “party school” group seems relatively small, but dominant. I do not see many offerings for students who want to socialize regularly on campus with each other in a more sophisticated way than currently offered, or at least making news, on the Row and the recent Halloween debacle. From my vantage point, the social interests of the majority of top 25 or better students are not currently being considered in planning or met at USC. Doing so is essential for a sustained USC rise and cementing a reputation as a university that attracts and keeps the best and brightest students and faculty. 
Perhaps my perspective is limited by distance. I’d be interested in the views of others, especially those for whom USC is their day-to-day experience.
Linking the “Greek” system to this is absurd.  Have you ever heard or been to Yale/Princeton/Harvard? Their version of Greek Life would raise far more concerns than anything you’d find on the row on a Thursday night.  See the movie W or read anything about Skull and Bones or the Eating Societies at Princeton and then try to put down greek life again. Greek registered parties keep guest list enforced by professional security.  That isn’t even the point.  The point is that this party endangered innoncent students by knowingly inviting a crowd on campus that engaged in this activity.  The Row is much more vigilant as to who goes where.  Lets not forget sororities keep armed security on staff.  Fraternities do not allow thousands of “randoms” into their parties let alone their property.
Yes, Herman, I get your point and agree, as I am sure most everyone does. I am raising a bigger picture issue. Harvard has never been identified as a party school and has a very different social atmosphere, overall, than USC, one that seems more in harmony with its academic standing.
Poorly crafted letter. You beg for solidarity in you second paragraph but leave it to the final paragraph to explain what steps you are taking to address the problem. You spend most of the letter tooting your own horn. You offer not a single word of concern for all your fellow Trojans who were placed in harms way that night, including many of your own members. My daughter, like many other students was less then a 100 feet from where the shots was fired, and possibly only seconds spared her from being in the bullet’s path. She ran, like many others, fearing for her life, struggling to find an unlocked building to hide in. Where is your concern for all the students traumatized that night? I do not know what is your heart, but this letter is a complete fail from a public relations standpoint.
They should resign
Seal down the campus after hours.  It’s too wide open and too many bad people.
They should ban BSA from function for a few years.
Time for a bit of education – USC style.  Trojan Parnet (sic), it is difficult to find the sincerity in your statement, which calls for wholehearted unity by the Trojan Family, then questions why some of those members are allowed to have their own organization.  
Clearly, one post on the DT website is not going to be enough to educate you on our country’s long history of racism and oppression … but I’ll give it a shot anyway.  
When it comes to USC’s policy on student organizations, you miss really miss the point.  The beauty about USC – and the USA – is that if someone wanted to form a “White Student Assembly,” they could.  Asking that USC disband or disallow the establishment of clubs or organizations that highlight and celebrate the experiences of specific groups of students is tantamount to trying to deny the existence and experiences of those groups.  Assimilation is one thing, but the extermination of one’s culture or experiences is quite another.  
None of the student assemblies on campus exclude students from membership or participation on the basis or race, ethnicity, gender, or any other descriptor.  In fact, they exist as they do in order to encourage members of other groups to step outside of their comfort zone and experience something new or different.
Unity is not created by forcing (or politely asking) individuals to give up who they are or what they have experienced in order to become part of the majority – that goes for any oppressed group.  Unity is created when members of different groups, dominant and subordinate, are willing to look at a situation through their eyes and through the eyes of others.
Members of oppressed groups (i.e. Black, Latino, women, immigrants, etc.) have historically been denied the opportunity to share their stories and celebrate their experiences by members of dominant groups.  Organizations like BSA are one way to try and create equity in an otherwise inequitable situation.
As for sports being the most wonderful way to “break down barriers,” I’ll offer you two final observations: College football and college basketball are, almost certainly, the only two collegiate sports which turn a profit year after year (at USC and at most schools).  Yet, most of the money generated by those sports – which are primarily played by Black students – goes toward paying for sports that are primarily played by white students.  Let’s not even get started on the lack of Black college football coaches or female college basketball coaches either.  
The truth is that this incident, which was both tragic and troubling, presents all of us with the opportunity to learn and grow, or the opportunity to fall back into expected and familiar patterns of thought and action.  Let’s indeed stop racism in all its forms – and let’s begin here, by being aware of our own biases and privileges and making it a point to support and lift up EVERY member of the Trojan Family, regardless of what group, club, organization they belong to.  
Let’s celebrate all of our colors and all of our backgrounds, including Cardinal and Gold.
I dint care about barriers in 2012.  I’m a minority and I don’t worry or lose sleep about racism.  Some of the most offensive racist people I see live around USC and are so belligerent and crude I do  nit understand how they can possibly function in society.  You want others to treat you how you think you deserve to be treated then act like a good citizen and not a denizen.
If you really think a group of white students can form a “White Students Association” – especially in a school as politically correct as  USC – you are smoking some really good ghetto weed… 
I find it repulsive that when a disturbing crime occurs – we have to pretend we could not have seen this coming – because to do so would have cast ourselves as a racist in this overly politically correct society we have crafted. This is why your children at SC will never be safe. Not only are they smack in the middle of the South Central ghetto – but the Admin and LAPD have to pretend they are not. Therefore the common sense precautions that only make sense will not be put in place for fear of “offending” the ghetto’s usual suspects…
Keep up the politically correct charade USC – all you are doing is making criminals, muggers, rapists and thugs feel comforted that they will not be too aggressively deterred because USC is too cowardly to act assertive on crime.
Lamar, as a proud (pretty recent) USC alum, I appreciate providing some of your perspective. I also appreciate, as a vocal critic of the communication between BSA, USC Program Board, USC administration, and LA Hype, your plans to “reform” (in whatever capacity) for the future in the aftermath of this tragedy.
I despise those who simply throw the race card into this situation. This came from non-USC individuals (doesn’t matter the race, statistics, etc.) who aggregated on campus, creating a dangerous environment, plain and simple. This could have happened anywhere with the events leading up to it. This should be treated with everything in a vacuum, without the emotional and hurtful things said about our neighbors and members of other races, no matter where they reside. It only hits close to home because that’s exactly where it occurred.
With all that being said, I take umbrage with this statement of yours: “The act of one individual outside of our event, is not a reflection of our purpose” because it misses the point. (Logical, sensible) people aren’t arguing that this reflects against your purpose. We are simply not pleased with the failure to communicate and better enforce policy, stemming from the parties I mention above. I have no problem with BSA, or any organization on USC, for that matter. It’s well-known that LA Hype promoted this over the social airwaves as a public party. They should never have been permitted to make this statement if it involves our campus. Rest assured, I don’t gloss over them either.
People argue that USC has an obligation to be open to the community. In spirit, that is fine: we host many academic and athletic events (Visions and Voices, tailgating, etc.). However, it was taken advantage of in this situation for the gain of BSA and even more so of LA Hype. So much so that the policy was missed. In addition, we pay tuition to attend this fine institution. Thus, it is, to an major extent, ours. It does not “belong” to the community around it, though many from both sides may adopt one another for support (totally fine). Any non-USC people on campus, take heed: USC is still a private institution on private property with property and students (most of whom pay a pretty penny to attend) that must be respected. You would very much agree that if USC students were on your property, you would demand respect of your property and person. And the same applies in the opposite direction of students: our community, plagued by stereotype, deserves respect. Let’s continue to help it out and make it better to combat ignorance.
Of course, we all can agree that this event was a terrible occurence and we hope for the continued healing of those affected.  And I wholeheartedly agree that we need to join together as students, parents, alumnae, administration, police to help ensure the safety for all.
However, it still shocks me that in 2012, we still have “Black Student Assembly” as an organization.  It’s racist plain and simple.  Do we have “White Student Assembly?”  Of course not.  
We are not going to have “unity” as long as institutions like USC allow organizations to be formed on the basis of race be it Black, Asian, Islander…whatever.  Organizations should be based on members having similar interests which would naturally unify those members.  It’s why sports are so wonderful…all kinds of athletes from all backgrounds work on a common goal… sports are the kind of organization that break down barriers… not ones that include or exclude based on the color of your skin.
Let’s stop racism in ALL its forms.
“PARENT”
Black people can’t have a group of their own?   Is that what you are saying in 2012?  Sounds more like 1952 if you ask me.
I’m white and love going to BSA activities.  It’s not a racist organization in the slightest.  USC also has APASA, El Centro Chicano, and other multicultural organizations.
Okay that’s great.  However, why did you scrub the BSA website the morning after the shooting of all things related to the event?   Why did people apparently representing the BSA say (some continue to say) the BSA was not responsible for the event?
Me culpa.
[…] will focus on cultural programming and work with the university to reform campus security. In a letter to the Daily Trojan, BSA executive director Lamar Gary wrote:These are times of hardship not only for the Trojan family […]

Pinchas Cohen was formally installed as the dean of the Davis School of Gerontology last week in a ceremony held at Town & Gown.
Cohen is also the executive director of the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center and holder of the William and Sylvia Kugel Dean’s chair.
He previously held the position of Vice Chair for Research at the Mattel Children’s Hospital at UCLA and was also the co-director of the UCSD/UCLA Diabetes Research Center and a professor at UCLA.
He has focused his research on mitochondrial biology and co-founded CohBar, a company that develops mitochondrial peptides to treat diabetes.
The ceremony, attended by staff, faculty and Cohen’s friends and family, began with a processional of USC’s academic deans and other USC officials, including trustees Verna B. Dauterive, Carol Campbell Fox and Robert Padgett; and other administrators including Provost Elizabeth Garrett, Al Checcio, senior vice president for university advancement, and Robert Abeles, senior vice president of finance and Chief Financial Officer.
“The Talmud says, ‘For the unlearned, old age is winter; for the learned, it is the season of the harvest,’” President C. L. Max Nikias said during the ceremony. “In Dr. Cohen, we welcome a distinguished leader who will ensure the USC Davis School enjoys a season of harvest.”
Cohen gave a speech discussing the history of Davis and thanking everyone who aided his transition to USC.
“My fellow Trojans — it feels good to say that — I am delighted to begin this journey alongside you,” Cohen said. “Gerontology is the story of us all, and I can think of no cause nobler — or more necessary.”
Cohen said he thinks the future of the field includes initiatives in digital aging, which uses social media and other technologies to find aging solutions, and personalized aging, looks at genetic factors to tailor medical care to individuals.
Nikias also presented Cohen with a cherrywood replica of a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed chair as a gift to honor his acceptance of the Kugel Dean’s Chair.
“Dr. Cohen was the perfect choice to lead the USC Davis School of Gerontology,” Nikias said. “As a result, we will see a school infused with youthful vigor that will never grow old, even as the school grows older.”

Student activists stage a rally outside President C. L. Max Nikias’ tailgate to protest his refusal to meet with students regarding USC’s violation of the Worker’s Code of Conduct. More than 60 students from across the country gathered on campus this weekend to discuss strategies for different activism campaigns on college campuses.

Go SCALE! Maybe Nikias will finally consider signing onto the WRC.
I’m glad someone’s speaking out for these issues on our campus, I hope our university jumps on this and puts it behind us already. We’re headed for the top as a prestigious university and we don’t need this kind of record.
Whoa this is amazing! Talk about holding up Trojan Pride and the Trojan way! Fight on!
Thanks SCALE for all of your hard work!! Nikias should definitely affiliate USC with the WRC and finally make our campus sweatshop free!!
Our campus benefits from using sweatshops, and the sweatshops benefit from having our campus’s business.
While this may be true, what about the human cost?  Are we now the type of society that believes it is okay to take advantage of those who can’t speak up for themselves, simply because their oppressors are okay with it…so that I can pay a few dollars less for a branded product?  I would hope that our perspective still extends past our own nose.
Way to go SCALE!
Is this the SCALE freaks again?
Probably. Losers.
If you’re going to make insults about students trying to make a difference on our campus at least be bold enough to use your real name.
I respectfully decline. I feel no need to justify myself to people intent on disrupting a mutually beneficial system. There are lots of studies of the economic benefits of low-cost labor that you could examine if you were willing to consider viewpoints critical of your own. Yours is a noble ambition, but despite the meager change that you might (but hopefully not) garner here at USC, you are fated to lose the war of wages. It is far more likely that the minimum wage will be repealed (and I sincerely hope that it is—it will benefit millions of low-wage workers in this country for a host of empirically backed economic reasons) than sweatshops will cease to exist.
Really? I am not sure what you think is good about having low cost labor besides increasing profits for those who use it… Of course all that matters is money right?

As the nation prepares to elect a president Tuesday, the upcoming election also brings three prominent ballot measures to a vote in Los Angeles County. Residents of the nation’s most populous county will cast their vote on measures A, B and J on Tuesday.
Measure A would allow for an amendment to the Los Angeles County charter, permitting the appointment of the county tax assessor. The position of tax assessor is currently an elected office, and changing this to an appointment would also require an amendment to the California State Constitution.
This position has recently come under fire because of allegations of corruption. Current Assessor John Noguez recently faced felony charges stemming from his alleged role in a bribery scheme to reduce the property tax bills of his wealthy campaign contributors.
Supporters of Measure A hope it would help reduce misconduct, citing the idea that corruption among elected officials happens more often than among people who are appointed to their positions. Those who oppose the measure, however, worry about an appointed official’s lack of accountability to the public.
Camille Saucier, an undecided freshman who votes in Los Angeles County, said she wouldn’t vote yes on Measure A because appointing an assessor would not necessarily make the position less corrupt.
“It’s silly to switch the assessor from an elected office to an appointed one,” Saucier said.  “Such a process would not be very transparent. There would be even less transparency in the office than there is now and that could fuel more political corruption.”
Measure B would require producers of adult films to acquire a health permit from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to produce their films for sale, and would also require producers to pay a fee to the Health Department to offset the cost of the enforcement. The measure would also require that all adult performers use condoms.
Proponents of the measure argue that safer sex and regulatory practices need implementation in the adult film industry, while others insist that Measure B would hinder Los Angeles’ thriving pornography industry.
Measure J, the last of the major Los Angeles County ballot measures, would authorize the continuation of a sales tax imposed by a 2008 measure (Measure R) and proposed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. If Measure J passes, retail transactions in Los Angeles County would maintain an additional 0.5 percent sales tax for 30 more years than previously allotted, from 2039 to 2069.
Genevieve Giuliano, director of the METRANS Transportation Center and a professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, explained the measure could change how the county develops infrastructure.
“Until now, L.A. transportation has been funded with a ‘pay as you go’ plan. As the sales tax generates revenue, agencies figure out how much they can build,” Giuliano said. “However, with Measure J, we can do even more. It’s a way of generating a larger projected amount of money for this infrastructure.”
The current tax, if untouched by Measure J, would expire in 2039. The extension of the tax would benefit transit and road repair projects across Los Angeles County, although some believe that the legislation is poorly timed, unorganized and unnecessary in nature.
Giuliano also said that choosing how to vote on this legislation can be difficult for voters, as it requires them to decide how they want city government to fund infrastructrue projects.
“Should you borrow money to build infrastructure? Are the projects worth as much to us as the carrying cost would in the future?” Giuliano said. “The answer to this is less clear when discussing projects with less visibility.”
Most voters, however, tend to side with students, such as human biology major Briahna Hendey, who cited the lack of better public transportation in Los Angeles as a reason for passing Measure J.
“Los Angeles has a need for better public transportation,” Hendey said. “I think Measure J would help to improve our metro system and to make it easier to get around the city.”
Because of Measure J’s large base of support, experts such as Giuliano predict that the measure will be successful on Election Day.
“There is a good possibility that it will be passed. Measure J asks for a continuation of this tax so our current generation of voters is not going to be paying the sales tax primarily,” Giuliano said. “Thus, there is nothing to lose as a voter. They simply receive more infrastructure earlier.”
Hi Christina Ellis,
Your infographic is very nice. Unfortunately, you used a map of Los Angeles CITY, not Los Angeles COUNTY, the jurisdiction of these ballot measures.

The Undergraduate Student Government, Program Board and Black Student Assembly issued statements in response to the shooting that took place on campus on Halloween.
At least seven gunshots were fired at approximately 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday when one suspect engaged in a physical confrontation with former Crenshaw High School football star Geno Hall. Hall sustained at least seven gunshot wounds to his left thigh, back of his leg, buttocks and arm, according to the Los Angeles Times. Three other victims were also wounded and transported to California Hospital Medical Center, but are expected to make a full recovery.
Officers identified the shooter and another man fleeing the scene with him and pursued the suspects to Parking Lot 6, where they detained both men and recovered a handgun. Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested one of the men at the scene, the department confirmed Friday.
The Los Angeles Times reported the arrested suspect’s identity as 19-year-old Brandon Spencer, a security guard from Inglewood, and said he has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The shooting occurred outside of “Freak or Greek,” an on-campus Halloween party held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom. The party, which was heavily promoted by event organizer LA Hype on social media, drew a crowd of about 400 USC students and other college students. More than 100 people were waiting in line to enter the party at the time of the shooting.
Scheduling paperwork for the event was filed under the Black Student Assembly’s name, Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos told the Daily Trojan. BSA  is an organization that falls under Program Board, which is USG oversees.
Geragos also said that internal Program Board paperwork was filed under BSA’s name.
Program Board Executive Director Juan Espinoza, BSA Executive Director Lamar Gary and Geragos released a letter to the editor of Daily Trojan on Sunday in response to the shooting. The full text of the letter can be found on the Daily Trojan website.
“The intent of the event was to create a safe, secure, and alcohol-free environment on campus for students on the night of Halloween,” the letter said. “We did not foresee the tragedy that would transpire.”
The shooting also prompted BSA to ban social events for the remainder of the semester.
“In moving forward, the Black Student Assembly has decided to suspend hosting parties and other socially driven events for the remainder of the semester,” the letter said.
The letter also said that Program Board will place greater review on approving co-sponsorship of events.
“Program Board will also increase the scrutiny placed on outside organizations during the review process of co-sponsorship,” the letter said. “Our efforts are first and foremost to serve the USC student body, while at the same time fostering an inclusive community in adherence to the USC strategic vision.”
USG and BSA also released statements about the shooting Friday afternoon. Both groups expressed their condolences for the victims who were injured in the confrontation, as well as their desire to prevent another shooting from happening in the future.
In USG’s statement, Geragos expressed his condolences to the four victims who were injured in the shooting that occurred outside the “Freak or Greek” party.
“It is truly disturbing that the shooting happened during one of our assembly’s campus events, but we are working with our university leadership in taking immediate action to develop additional measures for campus safety and security,” Geragos said in the statement.
In BSA’s statement, Gary said he hopes the incident will not reflect poorly on BSA.
“We are currently working in conjunction with the administration to address any concerns that might have arisen,” Gary said. “This incident is not a reflection of the Black Student Assembly. We have gone to great lengths this year to direct our attention towards cultural awareness and mentorship.”

Olympic athletes and top USC administrators attended a groundbreaking for a $16 million aquatics center on Saturday.
1983 swim captain Fred Uytengsu, the namesake for the center, donated a record $8 million to fund the new complex, which will include training areas, locker rooms, offices, meeting rooms and improvements to the diving tower and pool deck.
Uytengsu is the president and CEO of Alaska Milk Corp, a dairy company in the Philippines.
The new aquatics center is slated for completion in 2014.
“Fred’s gift will have an impact beyond brick and mortar,” USC swim coach Dave Salo said last May during the announcement for the project. “The design of the new facility will make the spectator experience so much more enjoyable and USC student-athletes will have greater access to their coaches and trainers and the unique opportunity to train in a world-class facility.”
USC President C. L. Max Nikias and Athletic Director Pat Haden both spoke at the hour-long event. Other speakers included Peter Daland, a former USC swim coach, John Naber, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, and Madeline Rosenthal, a current women’s water polo player.
The center’s swimming pool will be named after Deland, Utyengsu’s coach at USC. Between 1958 and 1992, Deland led USC to nine NCAA championships and 17 conference titles. Uytengsu graduated from USC’s business entrepreneurship program in 1983. Initially, Uytengsu joined the swim team as a walk-on during his freshman year.
“Without a doubt, swimming at USC — and for Coach Daland — was a great opportunity,” Uytengsu said last May.  “And I am now pleased to be able to give back and support the university’s goal of upgrading facilities.”

On the day they received championship rings from 2011, the Trojans kept rolling on their quest for a fifth consecutive national title.
In front of a lively home crowd on Saturday, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (21-0, 6-0) used a dominant first half to defeat Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foe No. 5 UC Santa Barbara (15-7, 1-4) 12-7.
Standing tall · Junior goalie James Clark, a native of Rozelle, Australia, saved 14 of 21 shots in the cage in Saturday’s 12-7 win. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Junior driver Nikola Vavic led the Trojan scoring effort with a hat trick, and moved into a tie for ninth on USC’s all-time scoring list with his 150th career goal early in the final period. He needs one more goal to tie for eighth and three more goals to move into sole possession of seventh on the all-time list. Junior two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias also added to the Trojan scoring effort with two goals apiece.
USC recovered from some early miscommunications to put up 12 goals. A big reason behind the scoring effort was a heavy emphasis on finding teammates in the right position.
“Our passes were crisp,” senior driver Stephen Siri said. “I think our large focus was to put away easy opportunities that come from good passing and setups, and we did that today.”
The Trojans limited the Gauchos to their lowest first-half scoring output all year while taking a 4-1 lead.
“We were pretty physical on defense and pushed [USCB] away from the cage,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We did a good job in recognizing when a two-meter man established position so we were able to come back and really force them into some poor shots.”
Nikola Vavic and Genidounias paced the Trojans with two goals each in the first half, but the unquestioned star of the first half was junior goalkeeper James Clark.
Playing in his first season at USC after making the Australian Olympic squad, Clark had 10 saves in the first half on Saturday and 14 for the match.
“He works so hard in practice and is always focused,” junior two-meter and fellow Australian Jeremy Davie said. “When’s he’s on his day, it’s impossible to score on the guy.”
“This was one of his best games in the cage for us,” Jovan Vavic added. “[UC] Santa Barbara got a little nervous after he blocked all those shots, and it affected their attack.”
After a low-scoring first half, the third period was a wild one. The Trojans scored two quick goals to open the half, the first on a well-placed lob pass from Nikola Vavic to junior utility Mace Rapsey, taking a 6-1 lead. The Gauchos quickly responded, scoring two goals in two minutes to cut the deficit back to three goals at 6-3.
On USC’s next possession, senior driver Tobias Preuss hit Davie with an arcing lob pass, and Davie threw the ball into the net as the shot clock expired. A goal by Preuss with under a minute left in the third period extended the lead to 8-3, and the Gauchos never trailed by less than four goals for the rest of the match.
“When we play with energy, teams can’t keep up with us,” Davie said. “We can rotate six men in at a time a lot because we have the depth to do that, and we can outswim other teams.”
The game was physical throughout, but USC’s quickness and depth ended up winning out over the Gauchos’ advantage in size.
“As we work teams through the counter in the second half, that’s where we can wear some teams down,” Siri added.
The Trojans host Concordia then travel to take on Pepperdine next weekend, before coming back in two weekends to host a match against UCLA that will likely determine the top seed for the MPSF tournament.

Perhaps USC can now empathize with hapless Colorado. When senior quarterback Matt Barkley completed 95 percent of his passes and threw for six touchdowns against the Buffaloes on Oct. 20, many celebrated the Trojans’ bevy of new offensive records, never stopping to think how helpless Colorado’s defense must have felt.
Missed opportunity · USC coach Lane Kiffin cited senior defensive end Wes Horton’s (96) first-quarter sack as one of two key chances for a turnover. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
This time, on the other end of an offensive onslaught, the Trojans witnessed a redefinition of the term “video game-like numbers.” In Saturday’s 62-51 loss against Oregon, USC’s defense faced 12 offensive series from the Ducks’ up-tempo spread offense; Oregon scored touchdowns on nine of them.
“We weren’t aligned in our assignments perfectly like we were last year,” redshirt sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey said of the defense’s inability to produce stops. “We blew a lot of our assignments, and they capitalized on every single mistake.”
In their three non-scoring series, the Ducks missed a field goal, fumbled the ball on a shotgun snap that Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota never fielded cleanly and punted in the fourth quarter after the game was out of reach.
In essence, the Trojans’ defense — a unit hailed for its improvement earlier in the season — produced only one actual defensive stop in the entire game.
“With our offense playing the way they did, we had to get one or two stops and we would be in this game,” Bailey said. “Our defense just didn’t do that tonight, and that’s why we’re on the losing side.”
Following the game, USC coach Lane Kiffin didn’t offer much explanation for USC’s inability to stop Oregon from marching down the field at will.
Instead, he lamented three offensive series in which the Trojans were unable to put points on the board: the first series of the game in which USC settled for a field goal, Barkley’s interception on a fade route intended for sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee that ended the Trojans’ second offensive series and Lee’s fumble in the red zone at the end of the first half.
“Unfortunately, we shot ourselves in the foot,” Kiffin said. “The game comes down to three offensive possessions.”
Barkley agreed with his coach’s assessment.
“We knew it was going to be a shoot-out,” Barkley said. “I felt like we had to play perfect on offense.”
But given the historic feebleness of USC’s defense on Saturday, many defensive players quickly shouldered the blame for the loss.
“Our offense put up 51 points,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “That should be enough.”
The number of records Oregon set seems to side with McDonald’s assessment, as USC Sports Information will have plenty of work this offseason when re-writing the USC football media guide’s “All-Time Opponents’ Records” section.
Beginning with Oregon running back Kenjon Barner, who has vaulted himself into a two-man Heisman Trophy race with Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, is a good starting point. Barner ran for 321 yards on 38 carries, scoring five touchdowns. All of those numbers broke USC opponent records, except for the 38 carries, which fell one short of former UCLA running back Gaston Green’s mark in 1986. Previously, former Penn State running back Curtis Enis held the record for most rushing yards against USC with 241 in 1996, while six players had scored four touchdowns against USC.
“He’s a slick guy,” Bailey said of Barner. “He keeps his feet moving, kind of like De’Anthony. They just keep running, but you got to really wrap his legs up so you can bring him down.”
Barner’s outrageous statistics buoyed Oregon’s offense to historic numbers for a USC opponent. The Trojans began playing football in 1888, and Saturday’s game marked both the most points (62) and the most total yards (730) a USC team has ever surrendered. The previous record for most points allowed by a USC team was 56 in its triple-overtime loss to Stanford last season at the Coliseum. Oregon’s 730 total yards shattered Notre Dame’s former record of 623 posted in 1946.
“They just know how to move the ball,” McDonald said. “They’ve got fast guys. They know the offense well. You’ve got to tip your hats to them. They’re not ranked where they are for no reason.”
Even with the barrage of quick-scoring series, McDonald maintained that USC’s defense never lost its confidence and played aggressively until the end.
“Every time we took the field, we knew we had to get a stop and we had the attitude that we would get the stop,” McDonald said. “It just didn’t work out in our favor.”
The Ducks are REALLY just that good. At least, this year.
I don’t entirely disagree, but I’m still skeptical because a) all of their games until USC were against pathetic opponents and b) our constant underachieving (overall performance, turnovers, penalties, etc.) this year in almost every game.
We have become so impressed with ourselves that the team is not ready to play good teams.  We have the annual junket trip to Hawaii so the alumni can go on vacation and talk about how great we are.  We really need to go back and play the best teams in the nation early so that we are ready for the conference like we used too.
Great point! Even as a proud supporter, I will admit our team has been exposed and is one of the most overrated programs this year. It’s a big disappointment all around considering our performance last year and the amount of returning players.
They are not THAT good, we made them look THAT good with our poor scheme and lack of adjustments. 
The game has changed and we haven’t evolved like we should.  Kiffin needs to change of we will change him out.
The only word for that defensive performance is “embarrassing.”  If this doesn’t start calls for Monte to step down, I don’t know what will.  I respect what he’s done in the past (NFL), but he’s just not cut out to deal with west-coast college football.  I shudder to think it’s a lack of talent, thought TJ didn’t really show up on Saturday, from what I saw.  Obviously not many defenders did.  Or are the Ducks REALLY that good?

Well, we had a shoot-out on our hands last night, didn’t we?
Oregon defeated USC 62-51 in what was as exciting a game as the Coliseum has seen in a while (or, at least since last year’s triple-overtime Stanford game).
But the Trojans’ defense was unable to make stops on a Duck offense that refused to be stopped.
USC sits at 6-3. The season is far from over. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley still has a chance to lead his team to a 9-3 record, including a big one over a likely undefeated Notre Dame.
But the biggest problem the Trojans face will not be whether they can put points on the board. As we saw Saturday, USC can score with the best of them, even against a stingy Oregon defense.
The problem with USC is its defense. And boy, is it a problem.
More specifically, though, it’s the atrocious run defense.
The Trojans gave up 730 total yards to Oregon, including 321 yards to star tailback Kenjon Barner. Marcus Mariota (yes, the quarterback) ran for 96 yards, including a 58-yard scamper in the first half.
In total, USC surrendered 426 yards on the ground. It was the most a USC team has ever surrendered. Ever. USC has been playing football for more than 100 years.
A few months ago, I wrote the following after West Virginia gave up 63 points to Baylor in a 70-63 victory: “The fact of the matter is that the USC defense is too good to give up that many points. They are too disciplined, have too much pride and are too well-coached.”
Oops.
I’ll admit it. I was wrong. I was absolutely, positively wrong. I gave assistant head coach Monte Kiffin a lot of credit, thinking that I wouldn’t see a defense coached by him give up 40, 50 and certainly not 60 points. They held Oregon to 35 on the road last year, after all.
But I guess I should have seen this coming, especially from the rush defense. This is a team that gave up 202 yards on the ground to Stanford. They gave up 133 to a not-so-great Syracuse team. They gave up 219 yards last week to Arizona, which is a pass-happy team.
And then there was Saturday night: the worst statistical defensive performance in USC history.
Now, they are not going to play another offense anywhere near as explosive as Oregon’s the rest of the season (unless, of course, they play Oregon again in the conference title game, where the Ducks could put up 85 points).
Arizona State can put up points, and UCLA can too. Notre Dame? Well, we won’t get into that. I don’t know what to make of them right now.
But the Sun Devils are more than capable of putting up 30 on USC, and if the Bruins play like they did against Arizona last night (they put up 66 points), they could give the Trojans a run as well.
Making matters worse for USC is the fact Arizona State has quite the running back in Cameron Marshall, who torched the team for 141 yards and three touchdowns last season, and UCLA has Johnathan Franklin, who just broke the career rushing record for the Bruins. Franklin has 1,204 yards on the season, making him the second-most productive back the Trojans will have faced outside of Barner.
The next couple of games will by no means be easy; they could win all three or lose all three. I really have no clue how things are going to work out for this team.
But I do know this. Monte Kiffin and the defense have a chance to right the ship in the last few games of the season. If they hold (a big “if” currently), they can help this team get nine wins and get a rematch with the Ducks.
The offense will get its numbers. But if the defense can hold the next few teams to, say, 21 points, the Trojans will thrash them.
And if they give up 40? This could get ugly.
I like to give USC the benefit of the doubt. I really do. I think the defense can get it done to close out the season and win the Pac-12 South.
And if the defense hits its stride and visits Oregon for the conference title on the line, we could have ourselves another fun ball game. If they can hold the Ducks to just 40 points, the Trojans might yet have a chance at the Rose Bowl.

On the game’s sixth play, Marcus Mariota, Oregon’s first-year starter at quarterback, took the snap, paced back not more than two steps and effortlessly floated a pass that hung in the air for about 20 yards over the middle of the field. The ball landed in the hands of a wide-open De’Anthony Thomas for a touchdown.
Frustration ·USC’s defense, which returned seven starters from 2011, has allowed 1,368 total yards of offense in its last two games against Oregon and Arizona, giving up 8.8 and 8.2 yards per play, respectively. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
An announced sellout Coliseum crowd that had waited months for a titanic clash between the Pac-12’s two premier programs was suddenly quieted. Sixty-five seconds in, the No. 4 Ducks were on the scoreboard, already leading an overwhelmed USC team 7-0.
“We knew they were extremely fast,” sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said after the game. “We know their speed.”
Pullard finished with a team-high 14 tackles last November as part of an upset road win over Oregon in Autzen Stadium, keeping the much talked about high-octane offense at bay. But a year later, that same group was pummeled and shredded by a new-and-improved spread attack, and for essentially all of Saturday, USC played catch up as a result.
“They’re way better this year,” Pullard said of the Ducks, who have scored at least 50 points in all but three games this season. “They grew and they matured.”
In a fight for conference supremacy Saturday, Oregon’s offense flexed its muscles and raced past a Trojan bunch that looked exhausted just trying to keep pace. In the end, it couldn’t and then-No. 17 USC (6-3, 4-3) was outslugged, 62-51.
Pullard, along with the rest of the Trojans’ defense, surrendered the 62 points on nine touchdowns and 730 total yards — all single-game USC opponent records.
And so it was left to the offense to, essentially, match Oregon point for point, a tall order even for the Trojans’ prolific group.
“We felt it would be like a heavyweight championship fight, and there would be huge blows dealt throughout the day,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We needed to sit down, take deep breaths between rounds and go back and do it again.”
For much of the game, USC, which of course boasts talented playmakers of its own, was in fact able to trade blows. Though trailing 21-3 by 14:48 in the second quarter, the unit would score three touchdowns in the second quarter behind a dynamic passing attack, engineered by senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who would connect with wide receivers Marqise Lee, Robert Woods and Nelson Agholor on touchdown strikes throughout the period. And his throws to Lee and Agholor went for 75 and 76 yards, respectively, the third- and fourth- longest of his career.
Barkley, forced to shoulder much of the burden offensively just to keep up with Oregon’s dynamic unit, finished with 484 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions on 35-of-54 passing.
“We knew it would be a shootout,” the right-handed signal caller said. “We had to play perfect on offense and score every drive. And those three drives that weren’t productive came back to hurt us.”
Aided by the return of senior running back Curtis McNeal and sophomore tight end Randall Telfer from various injuries, the Trojans managed to collect 615 total yards. But that wasn’t enough to slow down Oregon, which re-asserted itself as the Pac-12’s top team, strutting past USC for its third win over the program in four years and seemingly putting itself on track to notch a fourth straight conference title.
That effort was spearheaded by running back Kenjon Barner, who amassed 321 rushing yards on 38 carries and scored five touchdowns —  yet another USC opponent record against a unit that had given up just six rushing touchdowns in eight games in 2012.
“I swear, he’s faster,” said Monte Kiffin, the Trojans’ assistant head coach for defense.
Mariota added 96 yards on the ground, as well.
Before the game, many expected USC could follow the same template from a season ago. After all, Oregon was held to just 35 points in the last meeting and seven by halftime. But instead of producing a similar effort, the Trojans struggled just to keep up with a team that many players called “faster” than in 2011: faster passing downfield, faster running the ball and faster getting to the edge.
“It looked faster than it was because we gave them the edges,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “You get tired as a defense, you get worn down.”
Kiffin offered his own take, adding: “They’re better than we were because of the quarterback speed. He’s playing really well. We gotta find out how to make a sack and a fumble in those critical situations.”
Though sacked three times, Mariota was never exactly rattled, throwing for 304 yards and four touchdowns while completing 87 percent of his passes.
Next up, the Trojans host Arizona State on Nov. 10 at the Coliseum. The game kicks off at noon and will be televised by the Pac-12 Networks. The Sun Devils are 5-4 this season.

The Man with the Iron Fists is an action film directed by and starring RZA, probably best known for his hip-hop icon status and work as a producer. For RZA, Fists represents a long-in-the-works pet project that embodies his affection for kung fu and for the work of Quentin Tarantino, who prominently served as a mentor and presenter on Fists.
Fists draws most of its influence from classic wuxia kung fu action films, in which masters of martial arts are capable of almost supernatural feats of combat. The film takes place in a rural hamlet called Jungle Village in what seems to be a mildly anachronistic version of 19th-century China. (Imagine if the Chinese government had been in possession of a gold-plated gatling gun in the 1800s — the modern-day map of Asia would probably look very different than it does now.)
RZA portrays the title character, a village blacksmith who finds himself the reluctant weapons manufacturer for multiple factions fighting over a prize — but instead of a glowing briefcase a la Pulp Fiction, the prize here is a massive shipment of gold passing through Jungle Village. As the blacksmith becomes more personally involved, the stakes increase and the bodies stack higher and higher.
The supporting characters include Zen Yi (Rick Yune), whose clan leader — also his father — is murdered. His father’s death sends Zen Yi on a quest for revenge armed with a suit of armor that is covered with enough hidden blades and spikes to emasculate a porcupine. Then there’s Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), a gentlemanly gunslinger from England, and Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu), the archetypal brothel madam with hidden wiles. And that doesn’t even begin to describe the film’s villains. The ensemble of this film almost seems too large to follow, but with each of the characters flaunting a unique fighting style and visual design, it’s surprisingly easy to keep track.
The screenplay for Fists, co-written by RZA and Eli Roth, combines the quintessential themes of the kung fu action genre (revenge, love, greed) with all the hallmarks of a Tarantino film (stylized visual imagery and gratuitous violence). Even for an action movie, the dialogue is minimal, although what dialogue is present tends to be heavy on exposition.
The main story, though standard in most respects, is believable, even if the action isn’t. Nitpickers might find the justification for RZA’s former slave character being a blacksmith in rural China a bit hard to swallow, but it’s a testimony to RZA’s fondness for Eastern philosophy: Unlike the Americans shown in flashback, none of the Chinese characters consider the blacksmith’s race to be worth a second thought.
The difficulty comes in trying to connect emotionally with the characters. Some near cliché scenarios are used in the third act to lend weight to the character deaths in the film’s climax, but the body count is so high by then that it’s hard to care. Nevertheless, the characters’ motivations, especially those of Zen Yi and the Man with the Iron Fists, are easy enough for an audience to understand — if not necessarily to sympathize with.
The quality of the acting performances in Fists are mixed. Crowe is especially enjoyable as Knife; it doesn’t hurt that his character is the pragmatic rogue to the Man with the Iron Fists’ romantic hero, with charm and witty lines to match. Byron Mann as Silver Lion, the lead villain, has plenty of style of his own to bring to the ensemble. Lucy Liu is convincing as a feminine force to be reckoned with, particularly highlighted by a climactic speech that could easily have been corny but instead serves as a sharp insight into her character.
The rest of the characters don’t seem to have much for audiences to latch onto emotionally, but whether this is a function of their acting or their characters is hard to say. Yune and RZA spend most of the movie looking disagreeable, but it’s hard to argue that they don’t have good reason to be. Yune, at least, has the occasional outburst of furious anger to break the silence. And even when he’s brought to his lowest, the Man with the Iron Fists is either doing a pitch-perfect Buster Keaton impression or channeling a stoic serenity. In light of the explanation of his backstory that follows, the latter is entirely likely.
In any case, Fists, as a kung fu film, lives or dies by the quality of the action scenes, which are frequent and well-paced. Although the film has only a couple of truly memorable, standout sequences — which still don’t quite have the same frenetic tempo of a Jackie Chan sequence or the grace of a Yuen Woo-ping sequence — the sheer variety of choreography used and the creatively designed weapons on display help compensate for those shortcomings. The climax consists of three simultaneous confrontations between good guys and bad guys, which keeps any individual fight from dragging on too long.
Ultimately, The Man with the Iron Fists is a decent film that, though lackluster in some ways, offers a strong entry in the grand scheme of modern Western martial arts films. A surprisingly apropos hip-hop soundtrack gives fans of RZA’s music something to look forward to, though it’s not as intrusive as one might fear. And moviegoers with a passion for martial arts action or revenge stories will almost certainly get a thrill out of it, but should be forewarned of an abundance of bloody violence.
But considering the names on the poster and in the credits, that hardly comes as a surprise.

There is perhaps no genre more difficult to adapt to the screen than video games. Countless filmmakers have tried to translate a number of high-profile video game properties to the silver screen, with only mild levels of success. Director Rich Moore perceived this daunting premonition as only a small obstacle to overcome when crafting Wreck-It Ralph.

Walt Disney Animation had been toying with the idea of a movie taking place in the video game world as far back as the 1980s. During the nearly 30-year developmental process, this initial concept underwent several major changes. Ironically, the film didn’t feature Ralph, an arcade-game villain, as the central protagonist of the story at first.
Originally, Felix, the hero of Fix-It-Felix Jr., was the main character, but as his story developed, the filmmakers became less emotionally invested. Screenwriters Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston found it challenging to build a humorous and morally effective character arc around Felix. Also, the characterization of Felix began to feel to similar to Nintendo’s figurehead Mario. In order to tell a more impactful, entertaining story (and only allude to a Donkey Kong-Mario relationship), the creative team decided to place the focus on Ralph.
Executive producer John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Disney Animation, helped in humanizing Ralph through interesting, unique qualities. At first, Ralph was named Grubble, but the filmmakers felt changing the name would make the protagonist more relatable. Ralph’s emotional struggle and satisfying transformative arc are both at the core of Wreck-It Ralph and help to make it not only an incredibly fun movie experience, but a heartfelt one as well.
Though there are a number of admirable qualities about Wreck-It Ralph, from its gorgeous animation to its unique premise, a pair of specific traits stand out: multiple detailed worlds inside the video game universe and a strong chemistry between voice actors. During production, Moore and his creative team stressed both aspects because they recognized their importance to the film’s success.
Wreck-It Ralph inhabits three very different video games as one travels with Ralph for the entirety of the film. First, we are introduced to Fix-It Felix Jr., the 8-bit arcade game home to Ralph and Felix. The world of Fix-It Felix Jr. evokes a feeling of retro when video games were simplified fun. From this side-scrolling adventure, Ralph moves to Hero’s Duty by way of Game Central Station, a world in and of itself featuring a plethora of cameos from well-known games (such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Q*bert). Hero’s Duty is a stark contrast to Ralph’s home: It’s much more dramatic, complex and violent.
This first-person shooter is clearly inspired by games like Halo or Call of Duty and features an incredible action sequence paired with a perfectly fitting score by the dubstep sensation Skrillex. Ralph completes his journey in the sweet, whimsical land of Sugar Rush. Described by Moore as the hardest world to animate, Sugar Rush is a essentially a fictionalized Mario Kart set in Candyland. Though each of the worlds shows off a very distinct visual style one constant remains: Each of the inhabited worlds is beautifully animated with a unique style and a surprisingly effective use of 3-D.
Moore’s stress on defining these worlds is easily recognized as he wonderfully clarifies parameters through the plot’s movement rather than direct exposition. The only fault in the games’ construction is the poor division of time between each world. More time is spent in Sugar Rush, making the second and third acts of the film feel much longer than the first.
Thankfully, these latter acts show off quick, hilarious banter between all of the characters. During production, Moore looked to re-imagine the voice recording process in the animated films. Traditionally, actors record their lines independently, with no interaction from costars. However, Moore and the film’s title star John C. Reilly noticed the benefits of having actors record together in the same studio. What seems like such a simple idea has huge implications on the dialogue’s effectiveness. Every exchange between Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer provides huge laughs. Some of the jokes are targeted for a younger audience and obviously don’t play as well with an older crowd, but many quips can be found for more mature viewers and erase any negatives from so-called “potty-humor.”
Though Wreck-It Ralph can be superficially classified as a children’s movie, its a hilarious cinematic experience for all ages. With great visuals and hysterical dialogue wrapped around an emotional core, Wreck-It Ralph is one of Disney’s best animated films in years.

Before the audience experiences Wreck-It Ralph in its completed form, they are treated to a wonderful animated short, “Paperman.” Using exclusively black and white coloring in a beautiful blend of computer and hand drawn animation, “Paperman” is the simple story of boy meets girl. The short film has no dialogue, and although that choice might seem odd in a modern cinematic context, it works perfectly for this story. Emotion and humorous charm are found in every second of the quick seven minute running time. “Paperman” is undiluted storytelling at its finest and an excellent opening act for the colorful, fast-paced story of Wreck-It Ralph.

The college crowd is undeniably passionate about the elections, with politically charged Facebook posts clogging our newsfeeds, tweets poking fun at the gaffes of presidential candidates and Instagram snapshots showcasing completed voter registration forms and absentee ballots.
Simply put, it seems that voting is cooler than ever before.
Yet, when it comes to the day election results are announced — the results after all the money spent, speeches delivered and babies kissed — students are, surprisingly, less than enthusiastic.
“Following the election live always takes forever,” said Johnson Hsieh, a sophomore majoring in computer science. “It’s just not worth the time to follow the entire process.”
Even though waiting and watching for the election results can be tedious, there are a number of ways to spice up what would otherwise be a very long and only mildly stimulating political broadcast.
There is no better way to galvanize friends and classmates into watching the election results than with a grand old party. In order to add a touch of “D.C.” to the party, have everyone come dressed in professional attire — suits, ties, blazers and briefcases. (An exception can be made for those who decide to dress as a baffled Big Bird.)
Though people might side with different political parties, these Election Day parties are nevertheless American, so bring guests (however politically-divided they might be) closer with red, white and blue silverware. As for appetizers and finger foods, why not eat what the candidates are eating?
From ordering dim sum during a trip to San Francisco to enjoying a good burger with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, President Barack Obama has quite the diverse palate. Serving some of Obama’s favorite campaign trail foods, such as homemade chili, pie and pizza, makes a great way to put a political spin on ordinary dishes.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, on the other hand, sticks to healthy snacks and basic comfort food. Yet when it comes time to indulge, the Republican presidential candidate looks to peanut butter and honey sandwiches and meatloaf cakes.
As for dessert, stick to patriotically influenced sweets — red, white and blue jello, tri-colored cake pops and chocolate brownies smothered in whipped cream and topped with raspberries and blueberries, to name just a few suggestions.
And no party is complete without games and activities. Instead of singling out the Democrats with “Pin the Tail on the Donkey,” make sure to provide “Pin the Tail on the Elephant” to balance things out. Or, better yet, make an Election Day scrapbook. Have guests bring their old magazines and try to fill a whole binder with cutouts of women before the results are announced.
But if this all sounds a little too cheesy, there are also Election Day parties going on all over Los Angeles.
Grand Park, Los Angeles’ newest public park located by City Hall, will host “Park Your Politics.” In addition to a 30-foot screen projecting the election coverage, there will also be DJs, street artists, food trucks and a beer garden. So even if the results start becoming uninteresting, there are plenty of others activities in which to partake.
And starting at 4 p.m. on Election Day, both La Poubelle Bistro & Bar in Hollywood and The Association LA in Downtown will host Election Day parties, complete with small plates, HD Plasma televisions and surround sound.
Don’t want to go out? USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism will host “Road to the White House 2012: Election Night Results” at the Tutor Campus Center starting at 5 p.m. There will be a free photo booth and Traditions will offer a 50 percent discount on a special election-themed menu to whomever is sporting an “I Voted” sticker.
But perhaps even Election Day parties seem too lengthy. Maybe there is a midterm the next day or project that needs to be finished. Regardless, there are still ways to get in on the results without having to host or attend a party.
Follow the results with apps for iPhones, iPads  and Androids, including Poll Tracker, NBC Politics and Politifact. Or check MSNBC or CNN online from time to time for updates on the election results.
Regardless of how Election Day is spent, when the results are tallied up and the president-elect is finally announced, whoever it might be, try not to let results put a damper on your whole night.

It’s important to be aware of your surroundings wherever you are, but this is especially true for Trojans given our university’s location.
In light of recent events on our campus, both on Halloween and last spring, it seems appropriate to address the issue of safety when going out at night. No matter how you go about it, the area around USC can be dangerous. There’s nothing wrong with admitting this; it doesn’t give our school a bad reputation and shouldn’t dissuade prospective students. It’s simply a fact that our university must learn to coexist with.
As students, however, we shouldn’t have to question our safety on campus. Being a well-funded, private university, USC has the capability to ensure that its students remain worry-free when walking Trousdale, eating at the Campus Center, jogging the track or doing whatever wherever on campus.
This doesn’t mean our campus has to become an isolated island within the surrounding Los Angeles community. Retreating to our apartments after sundown will not solve anything. It just means that USC should recognize that the well-being of its students comes before community involvement, especially when concerning an unnecessary party.
“Be aware of your surroundings.” This is a phrase we constantly hear, whether from parents or a vague email sent by university administration, but what does it actually mean to be aware of your surroundings? It goes beyond not talking to strangers and keeping your eyes and ears peeled for suspicious activity near you. Being aware is a state of mind. When roaming campus at night or using off-campus streets — as so many of us do on a nightly basis — mature and perceptive behavior must be adopted.
Travel in groups, especially late at night. Does it really sound like a good idea to be walking down a side street by yourself at 2:30 a.m.? No, it doesn’t, even when traveling with others. On a similar note, avoid using secluded alleyways and routes with minimal foot traffic. When safety is in question, using the road less traveled isn’t necessarily the best choice.
Always carry some cash (but not an excessive amount) and an ID, because you never know when you’ll need these in a pinch. Empty your wallet of anything you can’t live without or replace. It’s also smart to place your money in different places — socks, bra, pocket, you name it — so that you’ll never be without backup.
Unless absolutely necessary, avoid carrying credit cards and never flash around your fancy smartphone, iPod or jewelry. Nothing brings unwanted attention like the LCD screen of the latest gadget. Instead of using your gear to keep yourself amused, pay attention to what’s happening around you and, better yet, the people in your general area. Likewise, don’t obstruct your hearing with headphones at full volume — not only will your eardrums suffer, but you’ll be oblivious to outside noises.
Tunnel vision is equally as dangerous; just like your eyes shouldn’t be glued to your screen, don’t let your thoughts overwhelm your senses. Stay aware of what’s going on. It’s kind of like crossing the street, except you’re doing it over and over again: You look both ways and listen for danger. Trust your instincts. If something about your environment feels off, don’t ignore your latent Spidey senses.
While walking to your destination, also keep in mind that the areas around campus are semi-residential. Don’t be loud or obnoxious, because this behavior will only attract negative attention. Such an attitude will also make you look like an ass regardless of your location.
Another solid piece of advice is telling people where you’re going to be for the night. Keeping friends or family out of the loop when it comes to plans can have some nasty consequences (127 Hours, anyone?). One or more people you trust should know where you’re headed at night.
Don’t be hesitant to utilize Campus Cruiser, either. Why worry about navigating the quickest, most well-lit route to an off-campus party when you can just opt for a free car ride? Additionally, the time spent waiting for the Cruiser to arrive can be spent pre-gaming or gathering friends to ensure a smooth party departure.
Of course, all of these pointers should occur naturally to anyone with common sense. This column isn’t meant to suggest that you should harbor deep-seated anxiety when walking on or around campus at night. It’s a reminder.
The Trojan Family’s strength was evident when the phones of students everywhere lit up following the Trojans Alert text message, making sure that friends and family were safe from danger. Campus safety procedures must be seriously evaluated if USC wants to continue its rise to the top. Though it’s the university’s responsibility to plan events with closer attention to detail in the future, it’s our responsibility as Trojans to look out for each other and make sure we act accordingly.
Our spirit shouldn’t have to be tested this way. Stay safe and Fight On.

You missed two important ways that students endanger themselves and others:
1.  Don’t walk around or drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs!
2.  Don’t advertise your parties and your personal whereabouts through public internet sites!
USC students would never do that. Would they?
Boy, someone’s bitter.

In an artist’s studio somewhere in London, a young woman, Sylvia (Sarah Beth Comfort) throws paint on the canvas. She considers the painting, then takes her brush stroke and adds some green, some red, a little black.
Minimalist magic · Sarah Beth Comfort (center) stars as the narrator in Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up. The sparse set allows audiences to use their imaginations to picture the play’s events. – | Photo courtesy of Brianna McDonnell
Finally, she finishes and places it in the corner, perhaps wistfully. Behind Sylvia, the Darling family stands frozen in her apartment. Sylvia begins to describe them in J.M. Barrie’s iconic prose, and they begin to come alive in the studio.
So begins Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, an almost coffee shop-esque adaptation of J.M. Barrie’s classic play, which follows the  story of the Peter Pan as he leads the Darling children to Neverland.
As the story begins, the artist’s studio transforms into the Darling nursery. None of the props have changed, but with a little imagination, the stage is different. The chests become beds. The desk, a dog’s cage.  Paint cans are bedtime lights. The props give a simple charm to the production that makes it easy to accept the world of the play as Sylvia begins to narrate the Darlings’ day-to-day life.
With three children and a dog, the family’s world is bound to be chaotic. But director Zach Kaufer successfully controlled the chaos,  focusing on one person or action when everyone starts to talk at once, such as when the children circle around Mr. Darling to protest his treatment of Nana.
But more than anything, Kaufer’s Pan focuses on the idea of playfulness. As Peter Pan (Philip Labes) comes through the window, looking for his shadow, there is a youthfulness and vigor to him. It doesn’t matter that he is not on a wire and cannot actually “fly.” Rather, Labes’ acting shows he believes he can fly — and because he believes it, it is easy for us to accept that he actually can.
Likewise, it was charming to watch the Lost Boys “build” Wendy’s dream house. She describes a home with windows in every room and roses outside. With a few ropes drawn into a circle serving as the home, the Lost Boys proudly step back and admire their minimal handiwork. Sometimes, props can really be that simple. The production allowed the audience to imagine what the house looks like through Wendy’s descriptions rather than spend the time creating an elaborate set that might not live up to expectations.
The adaptation does not deviate from the original storyline, but through small details, such as the mellow alternative music and the lyrical, interpretive dance transitions that introduce the different fantastical creatures in Neverland, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Would Not Grow Up nudges the storyline into a new direction, giving the performance a cozy, intimate vibe.
There are other little reminders throughout the play that help to update the original story, with details like the narrator’s Toms shoes or her Skinny Girl Martini bottle, which doubles as a cup that Wendy (Hallie Golov) uses in the imaginary “dinner” she makes for the Lost Boys.
The soft and sad half-duet between Peter and Wendy was one the most successful of the play’s new interpretations. Using the nursery piano as the melody, Golov begins the song and Labes finishes as the two get ready to part ways at the end of the show. Labes, who is a singer-songwriter in real life, added an extra rawness to the concluding verse.
Though all of the actors delivered strong performances, Annelisha Dixon who played the lost boy Tootles “not the least brave,” delivered an exceptional performance. With her wide-eyed, younger-sibling-syndrome prone performance, she stole almost every scene. Austin Welsh, who played the villainous yet fun Captain Hook, also created a great interpretation of the pirate. Welsh, who was assisted by the comical performances of Smee (Ben Greene) and Starkey (Zach Kaufer), played off of their performances with  dry humor.
And of course, the always-present narrator gives the plot extra depth. Throughout the performance, she never smiles. She watches, she empathizes, she even assists the players when they need an extra character to serve as Peter’s shadow or as a pirate. She is never actually in the story, though. As an adult, she has grown up and is unable to actually reach Neverland.
Watching the narrator observe Wendy as she goes on adventures is a reminder of how short childhood is. The production questions what happens to fantasy and playfulness when one gets older.
The audience never learns what Sylvia was painting in the beginning of the performance, nor do they learn her past or future. As the curtains close, however, Peter Pan shows up at her window — for what purpose the audience does not know, but one suspects that she has been painting Neverland.

Tomorrow, Californians will be faced with a question of life or death.
In addition to choosing the next president of the United States, California voters must decide whether they will continue to support the death penalty, or vote to abolish it. If approved, Proposition 34 would replace the death penalty with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, including for those currently on death row.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Despite the many arguments for the death penalty, voters should support this ballot initiative in the polls to bring the California justice system out of the past and to further the cause of civil liberties.
Though California’s death penalty policy ended in the 1970s, a ballot initiative restored it in 1978. Since then, the state has seen only 13 executions. There are currently 724 inmates on death row, but the last execution took place in 2006.  Looking at the numbers, it’s clear this is a logistically flawed system that wastes scores of state funds on the hundreds of death row inmates that will never be executed.
Even worse, the death penalty is a morally loose system that gives the state the ability to play God so to speak — without the omniscience that would ensure no innocent citizen was wrongly put to death.
There is no surefire way to know how many innocent people have been executed, but there have been enough instances that should make even the most ardent supporters of the death penalty think twice. A Texas man, Carlos DeLuna, executed in 1989, was recently found to be innocent.  And Ellis Wayne Felker, executed in 1996, was later exonerated when an autopsy ruled him out as a suspect.
The possibility that even one innocent person could be killed by the state makes the death penalty particularly not worth the cost.
Additionally, more than 130 inmates have been released from death row in the last 40 years in the United States, further demonstrating the huge potential for human error. The stakes are too high for something like this to continue.
Giving the state the power to take the lives of civilians takes that power too far, and it is an appropriate time to end the death penalty not only in California, but in the country. California voters need to take advantage of this opportunity to set an example that will hopefully spread to the rest of the pro-capital punishment U.S. states.
Among Western countries, the United States is the only one that still has the death penalty in the books and the only Western country that executed a prisoner in 2011. Last year, America ranked fifth in the world for the most executions, following only China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  As a nation that proudly claims to be the polar opposite of such brutal authoritarian regimes as these, we cannot continue to have a justice system with such a backward policy.
It will undoubtedly be a while before the entire United States gets behind the anti-capital punishment movement, but California has the opportunity to advance a more modern system of justice that focuses on enacting punishment without resorting to the same fatal tactics as the criminals it seeks to stop.
There are those who support capital punishment and see Prop. 34 as an unacceptable liberalization and softening of the justice system for some of the worst criminals. But these supporters forget that for many, life in prison can be a harsher form of punishment, as inmates must stay in maximum security prisons their entire lives without any hope for escape — a hope that capital punishment essentially gives them.
It is not even a question that many people who are given a death sentence are the lowest form of humanity possible and deserve the highest form of punishment for their crimes — but it should not be in the state’s purview to impose death. Instead, those who would otherwise be placed on death row should be locked up in prison for life without any possibility for parole. Luckily, that is exactly what Prop. 34 would do if passed.
To ensure that the state does not continue to have the excessive power of executing its own citizens, and also in order to cut costs for a state already mired in debt — the current death penalty system is costing taxpayers an estimated $137 billion per year and one imposing lifetime imprisonment would only cost $11.5 million per year, according to the Death Penalty Information center — we must vote yes on Prop. 34. Ours could be the generation that pushes the justice system into the future and saves innocent citizens from death by the state.
 
Sarah Cueva is a junior majoring in political science and Middle East studies. Her column “Leaning Toward Liberty” runs Mondays.
Great article Sarah. Hoping that Californians vote YES to Prop 34. The death penalty system is not only barbaric, but it has been proven time and time again to be a seriously flawed system, riddled with legal errors, a broken system beyond repair, and most discriminative.

As Hurricane Sandy tore across the mid-Atlantic coast, USC students with family back east could only sit and wait.
Between smartphones, the Internet and 24/7 news networks, people today maintain an unprecedented ability to engage with another.
Nevertheless, Hurricane Sandy’s destruction serves as a reminder of the limitations of these technologies.
Skype, Facebook, Twitter and cell phones allow students to come to USC from all over the world and feel as if they almost never left home. Roughly 37 percent of the fall 2012 freshman class is from out of state, and 12 percent hails from outside the country. Technology, though, allows any distance to feel marginally smaller. It provides students the capacity to constantly stay in touch with loved ones across the globe.
During times of a natural disaster that results in power outages and the loss of cellular service, however, even the 24-hour news cycle offers little comfort. Media outlets detail the scariest stories of exploding substations, hospital evacuations and building collapses, but don’t provide consistently updated, hyper-local stories that might better serve people searching for information.
Time took take a step in the right direction by giving five photographers from different places on the East Coast access to its Instagram account. Time’s photography director, Kira Pollack, explained the decision in Forbes.
“We just thought this is going to be the fastest way we can cover this, and it’s the most direct route,” she said.
Unfortunately, a disaster as sweeping and unpredictable as Sandy — a storm spanning hundreds of miles and affecting the areas it hits with varying severity — limits this type of coverage. It just isn’t practical or imaginable that a news outlet could have a reporter in each and every affected town and city along the coast, from Georgia to Maine.
Time’s creative photo coverage certainly offered a more precise picture of how Sandy was impacting different areas. But when a person is separated from his or her family by hundreds or thousands of miles, such photos aren’t going to provide the same reassurance as a report filed directly from the family’s town. And unfortunately, coverage from local news outlets can stall as a result of power outages.
This was an opportunity for national news outlets to turn to social media, where hyper-local information was abound. Before, during and after the storm, people with Internet access or smart phone data plans were constantly updating statuses on Facebook and Twitter, and Twitter even created a blog post to inform people which accounts would be most helpful to follow for information from specific regions of the East Coast.
National news networks could easily have taken advantage of this constant stream of information. They could have fact-checked and published some of these updates online or used them to help in their own reporting.
In a world where 24/7 communication is a staple, and the ability to connect with loved ones from across oceans allows students to move farther and farther from home, Sandy reminds us that these modes of communication are not perfect.
Though these limitations shouldn’t paralyze students into avoiding traveling far from home, it is still important to recognize and remember they exist.

The No. 17 Trojans couldn’t keep up with the No. 4 Ducks in Saturday’s 62-51 shoot-out. Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
On the game’s sixth play, Marcus Mariota, Oregon’s first-year starter at quarterback, took the snap, paced back not more than two steps and floated a pass almost effortlessly about 20 yards over the middle of the field. The ball landed in the hands of a wide open De’Anthony Thomas for a touchdown.
An announced sellout Coliseum crowd that had waited months for a titanic clash between the Pac-12’s two premier programs was suddenly quieted. Sixty-five seconds in, the No. 4 Ducks were on the scoreboard, already leading an overwhelmed USC team 7-0.
“We knew they were extremely fast,” sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said after the game. “We know their speed.”
Pullard finished with a team-high 14 tackles last November as part of an upset road win over Oregon in Autzen Stadium, keeping the much talked about high-octane offense at bay. But a year later, that same group was pummeled and shredded by a new-and-improved spread attack. And for essentially all of Saturday, USC was forced to play catch up as a result.
“They’re way better this year,” Pullard said of the Ducks, who have scored at least 50 points in all but three games this season. “They grew and they matured.”
In a fight for conference supremacy Saturday, Oregon’s offense flexed its muscles and raced past a Trojan bunch that looked exhausted just trying to keep pace. In the end, it couldn’t and No. 17 USC (6-3, 4-3) was outslugged, 62-51.
Pullard, along with the rest of the Trojans’ defense, surrendered the 62 points on nine touchdowns and 730 total yards — all single-game opponent records.
And so it was left to the offense to, essentially, match Oregon point for point.
“We felt it would be like a heavyweight championship fight, and there would be huge blows dealt throughout the day,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We needed to sit down, take deep breaths between rounds and go back and do it again.”
USC, which of course boasts talented playmakers of its own, was in fact able to trade blows for much of the game. Though trailing 21-3 by 14:48 in the second quarter, the unit would score three touchdowns in the second quarter behind a dynamic passing attack, engineered by senior quarterback Matt Barkley who would connect with wide receivers Marqise Lee, Robert Woods and Nelson Agholor on touchdown strikes throughout the period. And his throws to Lee and Agholor went for 75 and 76 yards, respectively, the third and fourth longest of his career.
Barkley finished with 484 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions on 33-of-54 passing.
“We knew it would be a shoot-out,” said the right-handed signal caller. “We had to play perfect on offense and score every drive. And those three drives that weren’t productive came back to hurt us.”
Aided by the return of senior running back Curtis McNeal and sophomore tight end Randall Telfer, the Trojans collected 615 total yards. But that wasn’t enough to slow down Oregon, which reasserted itself as the Pac-12’s top team, strutting past USC for its third win over the program in four years.
That effort was evidently spearheaded by running back Kenjon Barner, who amassed 321 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 38 carries, another USC opponent record. Mariota added 96 yards on the ground, as well.
Before the game, many carried the expectations USC could follow the same template from a season ago. After all, Oregon was held to just 35 points in the last meeting, including seven by halftime. But instead of producing a similar effort, the Trojans struggled to keep up with a team that many players called “faster” in 2011: faster passing down field and faster running the ball.
“We played them last year,” said senior safety T.J. McDonald. “It looked faster than it was because we gave them the edges. You get tired as a defense, you get worn down.”
Kiffin offered his own take, adding: “They’re better than we were because of the quarterback speed. He’s playing really well. We gotta find out how to make a sack and a fumble in those critical situations.”
Mariota was never exactly rattled, throwing for 304 yards and four touchdowns, completing 87 percent of his passes.
Next up, the Trojans will host Arizona State on Nov. 10 at the Coliseum. The Sun Devils are 5-4 this season.
The Trojans defense some great athletes, but has no speed.  Barnar was running by defenders like they were in slow motion.  We also need faster tailbacks, the throw, throw throw game will end with Barkley and Lee leaving.  The running backs are efficient but once again we have no speed out there.  Tailback U has forgotten its roots.
“the Trojans’ defense, surrendered the 62 points on nine touchdowns and 730 total yards — all single-game opponent records….”
How long will it take before Pat Haden figures out that the Trojan offense is continually being betrayed by Daddy Kiffin’s pitiful excuse for a “defense?”
All one needs to do is look back at every game the Men of Troy have lost in the Kiffin Era, and they’’ see is the failure of the so-called “D” to make a single key stop.  Hell, if the Duck’s kicker hadn’t blown it last year, another great offensive display would have gone to waste, as was again the case last night. Washington, Stanford, Notre Dame, Arizona last weekend?!?!
It’s time for Pat Haden to tell Lame that his DADDY HAS TO GO!
