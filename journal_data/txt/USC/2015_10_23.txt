On Oct. 16, internationally renowned opera singer Stephanie Blythe gave a master class in Newman Recital Hall to students through the Thornton School of Music’s Vocal Arts and Keyboard Collaborative Arts programs.
Blythe maintains a reputation as one of the greatest mezzo-sopranos of her generation. Known for her thunderous voice and intelligent interpretations, the American singer has performed at some of the finest opera houses in the world, including the Metropolitan Opera, the San Francisco Opera and Covent Garden, among others. In addition to maintaining a celebrated operatic career, Blythe is an avid recitalist and has debuted many contemporary song cycles by American composers, including works written by Alan L. Smith, director of Keyboard Collaborative Arts at USC.
Smith and Blythe have a close professional and personal relationship, having collaborated together many times over the years. Smith introduced Blythe to the audience with much sincerity and cherishment, presenting her as a close friend rather than a colleague.
“She is compassionate, and fiercely loyal to those she loves,” Smith said.
As Blythe began, she emphasized that her guidance, though reinforced with many years of success, should be taken with a grain of salt.
“If what I’ve said doesn’t help you, just let it go,” Blythe said, drawing laughs from the audience.
Blythe worked with three singers, all graduate students in the Vocal Arts program. The class commenced with mezzo-soprano Kristin Erbst and pianist Robert Blake, who performed two songs from Richard Pearson Thomas’s “Cabaret Songs.” Erbst sang the first piece “Why Can’t I Let You Go?” elegantly and with crystal-clear diction, though Blythe specified that she lacked an intimate connection with the audience.
“We can’t just see your ghosts … [The audience] needs to see their ghosts as well,” Blythe said, pushing Erbst to dig deeper into her emotions.
Erbst sang the second piece, “Damaged,” with smoky and delicious timbre, commanding the audience’s attention as she trickled sexuality across the stage. Blythe worked with Erbst on supporting her tone through the entirety of each phrase while still maintaining conversational-like ethos in her voice.
“[The song is] entirely conversational; you just need to sing it,” Blythe said.
Following Erbst and Blake were tenor Justin Su’esu’e and pianist Chelsey Padilla, who performed “Cancer” from Tom Cipullo’s song cycle “Another Reason Why I Don’t Keep a Gun in the House”. The music is set to the poetry of Billy Collins, which employs a wide range of text settings, both morbid and humorous. The music swells dramatically then suddenly retreats, which according to Su’esu’e, is an allegory for the poetic text.
Su’esu’e possesses a sizable voice that carried effortlessly to the back of the hall. Like with Erbst, Blythe worked with Su’esu’e on supporting the tone throughout the entirety of the phrase. She also urged him to maintain clarity of the text as he sang into his lower register.
Last to perform were mezzo-soprano Lesley Baird and pianist Jasper Jimenez, who performed “Going to Heaven” from Aaron Copland’s Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson. Baird gave a deep and heartfelt interpretation of the piece. As with the other singers, Blythe worked with Baird on keeping the focus in her tone in line with her support. Blythe also worked with Baird on refining her dramatic interpretation without going over the top.
“Maintain a little bit of mystery,” Blythe said. “That’s what makes you an artist.”
This master class precedes a highly anticipated concert of Smith’s works through Visions & Voices, in which Blythe is also performing. The performance will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 20th at 7:30 p.m. in Newman Recital Hall.

First Lady Michelle Obama’s Reach Higher initiative has been the talk of town this past month. According to the White House’s website, the Reach Higher initiative is the “First Lady’s effort to inspire every student in America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university.”
As part of her Reach Higher Initiative, Obama delivered a speech on Sept. 29 to more than a thousand girls gathered at Harlem’s Apollo Theater. At Obama’s Power of an Educated Girl panel, accomplished guests included former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, 16-year-old student activist Nurfahada and U.N. Messenger of Peace Charlize Theron. The speech Obama gave at this panel has gone viral and has received widespread recognition and praise all around the world. So, at this point, you’re probably wondering why in the world I would disagree with higher education for girls? 
First off, I’d just like to clear the air and say no, I am not some misogynistic person who thinks girls shouldn’t push for higher education. As a girl, I completely agree and relate to the importance of education. So, why do I disagree with Obama? I’m not disagreeing with her Reach Higher initiative, which I think is a very worthy cause, but I am disagreeing with her reason on why girls should pursue education. In her speech, the First Lady’s most popular line that has been circulating all over social media is this,“There is no boy at this age that is cute enough or interesting enough to stop you from getting your education. Look, if I had worried with who liked me or thought I was cute when I was your age, I wouldn’t be married to the President of the United States today.”
When I first came across Obama’s speech on my Facebook newsfeed, I was all for it — until I read that last sentence. Then, my stomach dropped and I was a little angry. Obama had directly contradicted herself. She had defined herself — her awesome, insanely smart self — as the President of the United States’ wife. By saying that if she “had worried with who liked me or thought I was cute when I was your age, I wouldn’t be married to the POTUS today,” she indirectly implies that her ultimate reward for working hard and focusing on education was getting married to a successful man. With this, she demeaned her own accomplishments by defining herself as someone else’s wife and ] that her best accomplishment was marrying the President of the United States. No, First Lady, your accomplishments are far greater than that. You have become a spokesperson for women around the globe. You have become an international icon. You have developed policies and created worthy causes that have made a vast difference to society. You have the power to reach young girls everywhere and inspire them.
Obama probably did not mean to make this kind of implication with her statement. In fact, I believe that it originated from the kind of gender inequality that we all still live through today. There is this belief that gender inequality has been eliminated, but the truth of the matter is that gender inequality is still a rampant issue today. We’ve grown up in a culture where men are placed higher than women, and this “norm” has been rooted into our subconscious without us ever realizing it. That is probably the whole the thousands of people who viewed this video  merely glanced over this line and took no issue with it. It is also probably why Obama delivered this speech and made this statement without realizing what kind of implication she was making.
We define our own self. Our spouses do not define us. We are our own person. And yes, we should all pursue higher education. But not because it’s going to land us a successful man who will just “appreciate” our intelligence. We should pursue higher education because our rewards will be far greater than marrying a successful man or woman. We should pursue higher education to fight gender inequality. We should pursue higher education to break the proverbial glass ceiling for women everywhere, and to show the world that we are capable and have what it takes to be successful. We should pursue higher education not so we can marry the future President of the United States, but so we can become the next President of the United States. Because you know what? There still isn’t a female president yet. And I do believe one of us can make it. I want us all to believe that it is possible. 
 
I think what Obama is implying, is, girls too often get distracted by boys, popularity contests, etc. so it hinders their chances of reaching their full potential. I doubt she implied that if girls reached their full potential, then they would marry successful men.

The women’s soccer team will face Utah on Friday before taking on Colorado on Sunday.
The Women of Troy return to McAlister Field for these two major conference games after dominating Oregon on the road last weekend. Not only is the team undefeated on their home turf this season, but it also boasts a plus-five goal difference in home games.
Utah is on a three-game skid after coming up empty against a trio of ranked opponents. The Utes lost back-to-back home games to Washington State and Washington before dropping a game at Cal.
Though three straight losses may sound unimpressive, the Cougars, Huskies and Golden Bears were all ranked in the top 25 when they beat the Utes. Utah faced a tough three-game slate and narrowly lost all three games. However, it will not get any easier for the Utes, as the Women of Troy will be a handful to contain on Friday.
Like Utah, Colorado is struggling at the moment. The Buffaloes are winless in the month of October, but are still a quality side. A few seniors have graduated, but this is the same program that advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament last year, barely losing to UNC in the postseason.
USC’s engine in midfield is composed of Morgan Andrews, Nicole Molen and Mandy Freeman. Their possession-oriented style gives opposing defenses headaches. The three-headed monster in the middle is calm and fluid on the ball and exceptionally organized on defense. The Women of Troy’s defense is difficult for teams to break down because of their organization and discipline.
By playing with three in the middle, as opposed to four in the common 4-4-2 formation, USC head coach Keidane McAlpine needs his midfield players to hold themselves accountable at all times. In other words, backtracking is a necessity, and concentration lapses must be avoided.
The three-in-midfield approach is so effective for McAlpine’s squad because Andrews, Molen and Freeman eat up ground out there. Because the midfielders effortlessly cover ground all over the pitch, USC wears down its opponents as the game goes on.
Passes are crisp. Heads are on swivels.
All three midfielders exhibit tremendous pace and play with power. Because USC gets such production out of its midfield players, it can command games from the onset and dictate the pace of play. The Women of Troy are on the front foot in games more often than not.
USC has established itself as an elite team capable of making a national title push, and given the visitors’ uphill battle at the moment, the odds lean heavily in favor of the Women of Troy.
Teams do not like losing four straight games, and sometimes that frustration can develop into a newfound fire for a team. USC must proceed with caution against the Utes. Also, Utah is a strong road team, having earned four wins away from home this year.
The same goes for the Colorado game. The Buffs may not be trending in the right direction at the moment, but they know how to find the back of the net. They lit up the scoreboard against New Mexico and Villanova, winning 4-0 and 3-0, respectively.
USC hosted Utah and Colorado last year, beating the Utes 2-0 but losing to the Buffs 1-0.
USC is 10-4-1 this season and has serious momentum heading into these upcoming Pac-12 South contests. The Women of Troy have clawed their way back into the top-25 NCAA rankings and are really hitting their stride as the postseason approaches.
