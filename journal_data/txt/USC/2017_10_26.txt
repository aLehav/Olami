Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
It’s a simple fact that most sports fans are hopeless optimists. Dodger Stadium has been packed to the brim for the opening two games of the World Series in support of a team that last won it all during the Reagan administration. Tens of thousands of people pack the Coliseum week-in, week-out every year despite more than a decade passing since the Trojans’ last national title. Optimism is sports’ lifeblood, and even the most jaded fan has the slightest sliver of it.
But for the last week, it has felt like Notre Dame bled every last drop of that optimism during last Saturday’s massacre in South Bend.
Like many others, I have been almost blindly bullish when it comes to these Trojans since January. Ignoring all the warning signs for a far more challenging, target-on-your-back season to come, I basked in the Rose Bowl glory, completely convinced that the trifecta was coming in 2017: a Pac-12 championship, another victory in Pasadena and a return to the national championship.
Nearly 11 months later, and here we are. USC is still a frontrunner for the conference crown, but with the ultimate prize out of reach, the remainder of the season will only determine what sort of silver lining the program can take into next fall. Some have called for head coach Clay Helton to be fired, and others have declared redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold a bust.
I instinctively want to defend the Trojans. I want to point to Helton’s strong 22-9 record at the helm and remind everyone of what Darnold did against Texas and Utah this year. But there’s not much I can say that doesn’t ring hollow after USC last Saturday. I feel like a flat-earther: The facts are staring me in the face, but I’ve somehow talked myself into something different.
I’ve died on worse hills, though (I was convinced Blake Bortles would be a good NFL quarterback for far longer than I am proud of). What really scares me is that the nightmare may not be over. The Trojans are traveling on back-to-back weeks coming off arguably their two most taxing games this season. And like the losses at Washington State and Notre Dame, Arizona State is expected to have a sold-out crowd at its back. The Sun Devils beat then-No. 5 Washington and Utah in their last two games, and they will look to catapult themselves into the thick of the Pac-12 South race with an upset over USC.
After ASU, Arizona arrives at the Coliseum, and the Wildcats could be coming off a home win over Washington State, riding speedster quarterback Khalil Tate. Tate put up nearly 400 yards against UCLA — 148 through the air and 230 on the ground with three total touchdowns. After facing Arizona, the Trojans go to Colorado, then return home to face UCLA to wrap up the regular season. How great can you feel about any of those games? My greatest fear is when all is said and done this season, USC will have had a seven- or eight-win season with a trip to the Holiday Bowl — no different from the days of Steve Sarkisian and Cody Kessler.
There’s no bright spot to look to anymore. Darnold hasn’t hit his peak all season. The rushing attack that opened the year so promisingly has been derailed thanks to injuries. Special teams coughed up the ball and left easy points on the board in recent weeks. An intimidating defense that ranks among the nation’s best in forced turnovers got dominated in South Bend. Week-to-week improvement hasn’t been this team’s forte, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see another error-filled night in Tempe on Saturday.
It’s hard for me to believe that Helton and company will suddenly clean things up to win the Pac-12, which means that after all the fanfare, it’s just another lost season. I would say that the Trojans finally stole away all my optimism, but there is just a bit left — the hope that they will prove me wrong and win out … and win it all next year.

During his college days, alumnus Mikey Ahdoot had bad habits when he was a USC student; he often went to bed at 4 a.m. and woke up at noon. It was a cyclical routine he couldn’t get out of. But one day, Ahdoot decided to do something about it.
“I knew it was something I wanted to improve on,” Ahdoot said. 
He began researching ways to improve his habits, but soon found it was hard to find much of the information he was looking for. However, Ahdoot eventually created a solution to his problem: an app, Every Damn Day, that placed third at the 2017 Global Wellness Summit’s Shark Tank of Wellness competition earlier this month.
Ahdoot heard about the Shark Tank of Wellness through Blackstone LauchPad USC, an entrepreneurship program that helps provide students with the resources to build successful startups. The Shark Tank of Wellness is a unique global challenge giving university students the opportunity to submit innovative, impactful ideas for the wellness industry.
Of the 60 entries submitted, Ahdoot’s app was one of three selected to attend the Global Wellness Summit, an invitation-only international event that brings together leaders and visionaries to positively shape the future of the global wellness economy. The summit was held in Palm Beach, Fla. from Oct. 9 to Oct. 11. This year’s theme was the business of living a life of wellness.
Ahdoot graduated from the USC Marshall School of Business in 2014 and started his work in 2016 when he created a service that matched people with similar goals together as “accountability partners.” He then built the Every Damn Day app, a habit tracker and accountability resource. 
Due to the high cost of building the app, Ahdoot and his partners now offer a physical journal, the Morning Sidekick, through their company. The Morning Sidekick journal has the same functions as the app, but in a paper format. It claims to help users become laser-focused on morning productivity and happiness in just three minutes every day, and even promises to heavily impact their lives.
“Habit-building is such an effective way to increase the quality of our lives,” Ahdoot said. “We build the journals to be straightforward, simple systems for doing this.”
According to the Habit Nest website, the company’s goal is to provide users with the information, motivation and accountability they need to enact changes through simple solutions they can implement immediately.
Professor Paul Orlando accompanied Ahdoot to the Global Wellness Summit, and the two met through the incubator Orlando runs at USC.
“[Ahdoot] is incredibly passionate about his work, seeks out ways to help other people and [is] a tireless founder,” Orlando said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “He’ll find a way to get things done.”  
On the last day of the summit, Ahdoot had the opportunity to pitch his startup to a panel of judges who considered project innovation, visual appeal and design, relevance to wellness, business viability and quality of project presentation. Ahdoot was named second runner-up and received a monetary award.
Although the Every Damn Day app has not been released to the public, the Morning Sidekick journal is available online. Ahdoot and his partners plan to release a series of journals in the coming months.
“[Ahdoot] believes in reaching people in the most effective way rather than following the herd,” Orlando said. “As a result, when he found better results from his print products he doubled down there. He’ll return to the app in the future.”

The USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work has established a partnership with the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles to ensure mental health resources are accessible and available to Mexican residents in the city. The mental health unit is also a collaboration with the Department of Mental Health, along with several other community organization partners.
There has been increasing concern regarding the mental health of Mexican immigrants since the earthquake in Mexico City and the news surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 
”Following recent changes in the socio-political sentiments of the United States, this resource has been greatly beneficial to the Mexican community of Los Angeles,” said Luis Caso, secretary of foreign relations of Mexico. 
The work of Concepcion Barrio, an associate professor at the School of Social Work; alumna Paula Helu-Brown; Karla Torres, the health program director at the Mexican consulate; and USC graduate students allowed for the successful development and implementation of this partnership. 
“This pioneering program is important because we are dealing with a double stigma: immigration and mental health,” Videgaray said to USC News, explaining how he wants to see similar programs developed at all consulates worldwide.
Helu-Brown, a native of Mexico, described the focus on immigrants as critically important, especially in helping to improve the lives and mental health of fellow Latinxs.
“[The partnership] provides much-needed mental health services to people dealing with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health concerns that seem to have been heightened with the current political environment,” Helu-Brown said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Helu-Brown also said the program was developed as a response to growing concern about the mental health of Latinx immigrants. She is currently the clinical coordinator of the program and worked to develop it, emphasizing how seeking assistance can be tremendously difficult in Los Angeles.
According to Helu-Brown, the program is intended to provide a safe space where peoplecan obtain free mental health services on site, online, as well as education and outreach in efforts to reduce mental illness stigma. 
“Many times Mexicans who live far from their country fall into situations of fragility, addictions, nostalgia and depression,” Carlos García de Alba, the Consulate General of México in Los Angeles, said on the program’s website. “It is for them, for example, who will seek to benefit this project, as well as many others who need help.” 
I’d prefer that USC partner with ICE but you can’t have everything you want.

According to data collected by the USC Career Center, the University is striving to be the third-largest employer of alumni directly following graduation. Photo from USC Undergraduate Admission Blog
Though many students are preoccupied with where they will work after college, some Trojans’ journeys will take them right back to USC. 
Data collected by the USC Career Center on companies 2017 graduates planned to work for show that USC aims to be the third-largest employer of University alumni straight out of college. But students are also using the resources they receive at USC to work in a variety of different fields. 
Jennifer Kim and Erika Rodriguez, who both work in employer relations and research for the USC Career Center, analyzed the data. 
“For the class of 2017, Amazon was our top employer,” Kim said. “Right after that was Ernst & Young, and [the] third [employer] was USC. We’re hiring a lot of our own students.”
Other companies emphasize the tech and health fields: Google fell to sixth place, Microsoft was ninth, Intel was 10th and Kaiser was 14th, according to Kim.
“This is a work in progress for now,” Kim said, explaining that the data collection likely won’t be complete until this winter. “Those are the top employers that our students are getting offers from.”
In a separate study using data collected from LinkedIn, one USC student was able to estimate where the most alumni end up working after they graduate from the University. 
Ayman Siraj, a senior majoring in chemical engineering who writes for USC’s student-run blog Trojans360, created an infographic of the top seven employers of USC alumni. The post, which was published on Oct. 20, quickly gained traction on social media and was retweeted by both the USC Career Center and the official USC account on Twitter within two days of its original publication.
According to Siraj’s personal research, the top employers were Kaiser Permanente, with over 1,290 alumni, The Boeing Company, with over 1,260, and then Intel, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
However, Siraj admits the data is not fully complete or accurate. 
“There’s some caveat to it,” Siraj said. “Of course not all alumni are on LinkedIn, like the older [Trojans].” 
Recent graduates of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, Rayed Khan and Stephanie Brill, both work at Boeing. They say that USC’s academic preparation and networking was an enormous support in helping them land the positions that they are at today in Boeing.
“We do USC events … So immediately I felt like I knew USC people at Boeing,” Brill said. “I felt like there was this community that I could reach out to if I needed to.”
In addition to working as an airline support engineer and in customer support for Boeing Commercial Airlines, Khan is a deputy focal for USC. He explained Boeing has a number of “focus schools” in which it hires from and puts on specialized outreach events for. 
USC is one of these schools, and Khan cites the massive alumni support from the company that nurtures new employees and provides resources for them to be successful.
“You say ‘Fight On’ to your fellow Trojans when you’re at work,” Khan said.
While the strength of the USC alumni network is very apparent at these large, multi-national companies, Kim expressed concern that the infographic and other statistics of top USC employers will lead students to think they will have an easy way in at these companies because of their alma mater.
“One of the things that I’m sort of afraid of is, because of that list, everyone’s going to just apply to those companies or the top 10 I’ve shared with you,” Kim said. “My number one [piece of] advice is apply to as many different employers as possible and do not just go for the name brand companies. Students should diversify their job search.”

Three years ago, the future could not have looked brighter for alumnus Anthony Zhang. 
The 22-year-old entrepreneur’s startup EnvoyNow, a peer-to-peer delivery service app established at USC in 2014, had been growing ever since the ABC series Shark Tank’s executive producer Mark Burnett made a deal with Zhang — $100,000 for 10 percent of his company — valuing EnvoyNow at $1 million. 
EnvoyNow then expanded to other college campuses across the nation such as the University of Michigan, and his team was flooded with weekly emails from students at other campuses who expressed interest in joining the company. 
But all of that changed when Zhang and his girlfriend, McKenna Weinstein, a senior majoring in business administration, attended a Las Vegas pool party in April 2016. When Zhang dove into the pool, he overestimated its depth and banged his head on the bottom, leaving his body in shock. 
“Honestly, it was just an accident,” Zhang said. “I’ve been a swimmer my whole life, and it was so much shock at the moment that I don’t even have the next three or four days down.”
Zhang was rushed to the ICU, and after several surgeries, he found that the accident shattered his neck and spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed in all four limbs. 
After six weeks in the ICU, Zhang was transferred to Craig Hospital in Denver, which specializes in spinal cord injuries. According to Zhang, Weinstein also took a year off at USC to stay by Zhang’s side as he spent the next months in rehabilitation, intensive physical therapy and “basically learning to get back from [the incident].” 
“It was nine hours of therapy a day — the full nine hours,” Zhang said. “I was exhausted every single day, I was trying to get better, so I wasn’t thinking about EnvoyNow and just trusted that the rest of my team would run it.”
Through rehab, Zhang’s body slowly recovered; he can use his arms now and is still working to regain more mobility in his limbs from physical therapy. 
Months after the accident, Zhang received notice from his colleagues that they wanted to leave EnvoyNow. He learned that during his time in rehab, the company was not doing as well as he had hoped. 
“It was definitely a pretty bad point in my life,” Zhang said. “I had my physical therapy going, and people I trusted were pretty much giving up on our dream. All I wanted to do was to be back at the office, helping them out, doing it together, but I couldn’t.”
With the help of Chief Operating Officer Grant Shuler, a senior at the University of South Carolina, and his remaining team members, Zhang pulled the company together into a “core team” to ensure each aspect of the business was still running throughout last fall, all while undergoing hours of therapy daily. 
Zhang later began to work with several investment groups that were interested in acquiring EnvoyNow, and this January, EnvoyNow was officially acquired by JoyRun, another delivery platform.
“JoyRun’s purely college-focused, so it was an easy transition,” Shuler said. “In the first month or so, [we were] transitioning [our] team and then combining them together so that we could do a combined force across college campuses.”
Months later, Zhang already began building his next startup, Know Your VC. Compared to EnvoyNow, Know Your VC is more wide-reaching, Zhang said, applying to anyone who wants to research investors for their business. 
As a response to the sexual harassment allegations that circulated among Silicon Valley’s biggest investors over the summer, Zhang wanted to create an outlet in which people can anonymously exchange information about certain investors. 
“Having a platform where people can share these experiences and be safe without them completely blowing up in the news or without bottling them up … I feel like that is something worthy of building,” Zhang said.
In the future, Zhang plans on growing Know Your VC and continuing to pursue his goals as an entrepreneur.
“People have great ideas [for a company], but they are too afraid to do it, [and] it’s easy to get caught up in excuses,” Zhang said. “But that indecision, that hesitation … You don’t know when something might just completely change your life, so I would just take it and do it.”

USC Incubator director Paul Orlando is no stranger to helping cultivate startup ideas from their inception to reality, including his co-founding of Hong Kong’s first startup accelerator, AcceleratorHK. This summer, he will be pursuing another international project: Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge, located in Vatican City.
Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge united more than a dozen international early-stage startups with the goal of addressing environmental issues. The challenge aims to help these startups reach their respective goals, and provides $100,000 in seed money, which can grow over the timeline of the program. The central cause of the startup was inspired by the 2015 encyclical letter written by Pope Francis calling for a solution to an “environmental crisis.”
Many USC students and alumni are involved in the Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge. Orlando is joined by junior Ben Stanfield, who was the assistant program director of the effort, and two of the 12 startups include former and current USC students. Though USC is well-represented at the challenge, Orlando did not have any influence in who was chosen to participate.
The project was fully funded by venture capital firms, tech companies and organizations, like Fresco Capital, Instagram and Facebook. Though the Vatican was an informal supporter and did not host or financially back the project, Cardinals from the Vatican would occasionally check in on the startups and offer advice, according to USC News.
USC senior Kevin Kassel, who co-founded the water filter social enterprise Aqus, said the experience allowed him to better understand the buying power of his company’s demographic: primarily rural poor people in developing nations. USC alumna May Kabiri is also on Kassel’s team.
“For years, experts have insisted they were too poor to buy anything and would be a horrible group to sell to,” he said. “Turns out, there’s a big misconception in the understanding of these poor populations. They are by far our largest and most passionate customer base.”
Innov8tia also had USC alumna Tracy Wen Liu on its team, which aims to solve China’s toxic sludge issue by creating a process that will treat it.

In August, the Santa Monica City Council eliminated the city’s parking minimum policy,  forcing developers to ensure a certain amount of parking per square foot of residential space. To any Los Angeles native, this raises more than a few alarms — in this city, without access to a car, you might as well get cozy and hunker down for the long haul, because you’re not going anywhere. 
While parking is necessary, it is also an evil — every additional parking spot raises the price of an apartment by 12.5 percent. Waiving the parking minimum is just a piece of Santa Monica’s Downtown Community Plan for development, which aims to increase affordable housing by at least 30 percent. As students living in the eighth most unaffordable city in the world, affordable housing is crucial.
While some call USC the “University of Spoiled Children,”  two-thirds of the undergraduate student body receive financial aid, with more than one-third receiving need-based aid. On average, USC enrolls 4,000 more low-income students through Pell Grants than most other private research universities. Just like students at other schools, USC students must juggle work, social excursions and finances. 
Although most USC students live on or near campus, 10 percent commute, and a majority hope to work in Los Angeles after graduation. While this is not an unreasonable hope, it may be unrealistic. According to a county-wide survey done by Raphael Bostic at the USC Price School of Public Policy, 70 percent of employers cited that Los Angeles’ high housing costs are jeopardizing employee retention. 
Unfortunately, the scarcity of affordable housing is nothing new — there has been an affordable housing crisis in California for over a decade. This year is no different; the financial advising company SmartAsset estimates that people looking to rent an average two bedroom apartment in 2017 will have to make at least $109,543 per year. Making any less puts a person at risk of becoming cost burdened, wherein one is forced to spend more than 30 percent of monthly gross income on housing. For comparison, a person who wants to live in a two-bedroom apartment in Philadelphia must make at least $67,000.
Between the rising cost of living and the lack of available housing, poverty is becoming a pervasive reality for more and more L.A. citizens each day. In a report by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, homelessness in Los Angeles has increased by 23 percent in the past year. This figure is significant — nearly 58,000 Los Angeles citizens are homeless on any given night.
The impossibility of living in Los Angeles forces cash-strapped citizens to move to the outskirts of the city, drastically increasing the average commute time and travel costs alike. According to INRIX, a transportation analytics service, in 2016, the average Los Angeles commuter spent over 100 hours a year sitting in traffic. For the record, 100 hours is one work week for Elon Musk, and a little over one trip to the Moon for Apollo 11. Longer commutes mean more carbon emissions are released into the air. As of 2017, California earns the title of the state with the worst air quality, which is linked to a shorter life span; so to claim that Los Angeles is a breathtaking city is truly an understatement. Affordable housing is not only necessary for convenience’s sake — it is also necessary for the environment.
Thus, the Santa Monica City Council’s move to abolish the parking minimum and decrease housing costs seems like a panacea to the housing pandemic. 
But all that glitters is not gold — the Council’s strategy comes with a catch.
Critics like journalist and activist Jason Islas argue that the city’s push for a dramatic increase in affordable housing may deter developers from Santa Monica. A lack of interest may slow development to a near halt, which would be vastly detrimental to Los Angeles citizens.
While the city’s strategy has risks, which is especially troublesome given the gravity of the housing crisis, it is important to celebrate the city’s progress. Citizens must continue to be resilient — in a city where traffic is slow, and public transit is even slower, the patience of the average Los Angeles citizen can withstand just about anything. 
thers a real pollution problem in los angels.
Los Angeles needs to develop its public transit system or else nothing will change.
it is not possible to widen the capacity of the system there is no spacE

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
Former Fox News star Megyn Kelly has had a rough go of it over the past few months since leaving the network earlier this year. Kelly, who has previously agreed with a guest that Planned Parenthood “profits … by selling body parts,” moved to NBC at first to lead a prime time political journalism show, only to pivot to an apolitical morning talk show when the former yielded abysmal ratings. 
Kelly’s departure from politics wasn’t exactly a loss for anyone. Despite her smart, hard-hitting criticisms of President Donald Trump throughout the campaign trail, her hostile, inflammatory and often objectively inaccurate commentary on Black Lives Matter and feminism hardly made her the voice of reason. And yet, it was a disappointing — even tone deaf — move indicative of Kelly’s blindness to her own privilege. Her years of profiting from engaging in the political sphere, her career built on misrepresenting and ignoring the lived struggles of marginalized Americans, has always been a choice for her — a choice she was able to make because she had a choice in the first place. Others, who are in a constant battle for rights, recognition and survival, lack this choice in the Trump era.
But Monday saw Megyn Kelly Today go down a different route. Kelly, who has been open about the harassment she experienced during her days at Fox News, seemed to momentarily abandon her determination to turn a blind eye to politics, using her opening monologue to criticize an overarching culture of sexual harassment, male abuse of power and the silencing of female victims at Fox News.
“Women everywhere are used to being dismissed, ignored or attacked, when raising complaints about men in authority positions,” she said of the network’s workplace. “They stay silent so often out of fear — fear of ending their career.”
And while Kelly spoke about a very specific topic in her monologue, the fact that she spoke up at all had broad and unmistakable political implications. In light of new revelations of sexual predation in the entertainment industry and recurring revelations at Fox News involving the network’s former CEO Roger Ailes and former prime-time host Bill O’Reilly, the issue of sexual harassment and abuse of power has been widely discussed in recent weeks. Men hold the vast majority of positions of power across most industries, and abuse of power to sexually exploit and degrade women remain prevalent — handfuls of public figures are refusing to be silent about this.
What Kelly brought to the dialogue was new largely because it came from her — an individual who had all but sworn off talking about politics and activism on her new show. In speaking up, taking a stance and, in this particular case, standing with women, Kelly demonstrated how thin the line between politics and basic human decency has become, that silence even from those who are typically quiet has become impossible. 
The election of Trump, who has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual abuse, harassment and assault, and even admitted to assault on a hot mic tape from 2005, confirmed that there is disagreement among our nation’s voters and party leadership over whether sexual abuse is OK and warrants punishment. From Trump’s presidency, we have seen neo-Nazis equivocated to protesters for racial equality, almost unprecedented attacks on freedom of press and unapologetic attacks on women’s sexual and reproductive liberty. On college campuses across the country, there is constant, almost endless debate about whether self-admitted white supremacists should be welcomed, and rewarded with platforms to discuss topics like why black people are genetically inferior to white people, or why minorities and women should be stripped of equal rights. 
With fundamental issues like this one dominating national politics today, how can anyone say that politics is just politics, that it should be left untouched in our everyday lives? For women, people of color, the LGBTQ community and other groups whose right to exist in this country is being challenged, who are being insulted and degraded by the political conversations that many Americans are very seriously partaking in, this simply isn’t an option. 
Silence may not be a proactive, direct attack on people’s rights and freedoms, but it has stark consequences nonetheless. Silence is the force that enables oppression, that says “the sexual harassment and disenfranchisement of women are all OK, and can continue so long as they don’t affect me.”
At a time when, across political lines, activism, speaking up and all other actions characteristic of “social justice warriors,” “feminazis” and “liberal snowflakes” have become widely stigmatized, we can no longer ignore this basic reality — that “being political” doesn’t even mean being political anymore. In most cases, it just means being a decent human.

On Tuesday evening, A$AP Mob gave an inspired performance to thousands of screaming fans at Shrine Expo Hall for the L.A. stop of its Too Cozy Tour. The tour has been a reunion of sorts for the Mob, as principal members A$AP Rocky, A$AP Ferg, A$AP Nast, A$AP Ant and A$AP Twelvyy have been focused on their blossoming solo careers for the last several years. After releasing collaborative projects Cozy Tapes Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 each of the past two years, the Mob has discovered its newfound purpose as a collective.
The show was a scrum from the start. Hundreds of sweaty, antsy bodies attempted to push and shove their way forward as opening acts Key! and Treez Lowkey warmed up the stage for the Mob. Attendees maintained the high level of energy that A$AP Mob demanded throughout the performance.
The consuming bass of 2016’s “Yamborghini High” immediately rejuvenated a crowd that had all but burned itself out during the opening acts. A$AP Rocky, sporting a green and orange striped sweater, was all smiles for his glorious return to Los Angeles. The irresistable charisma that has propelled Rocky’s career was on full display, flashing a bit of gold each time the Mob’s frontman laughed.
The show felt less like a concert and more like a performance-driven celebration of A$AP Mob’s ascension as a brand and as a collective. The Mob was less concerned with covering its discography and more with letting the good times roll, but this led to no shortcomings in its performance as the members challenged the crowd to match their energy.

In an effort to shift the attitude in the room, Rocky crooned his psychedelic romantic ballad “L$D.” The heavy use of muddy bass and vocal distortion sedated a crowd eager to hear Rocky’s solo discography live. Rocky closed the Mob’s set with one of his more rave-worthy solo tracks, “Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2,” — in an effort to energize the exhausted crowd one last time, Rocky and Ferg instructed the crowd to form some mosh pits. Needless to say, the Mob’s loyal fans hastily obliged.
While recent collaborator Playboi Carti was notably absent, the Mob brought out a few other high-profile friends in their Los Angeles show. Rocky brought out West Coast rapper ScHoolboy Q for a performance of their 2011 track “Brand New Guy,” which ScHoolboy Q immediately followed up by playing his stadium-shaking hit song “THat Part.”
Rae Sremmurd briefly joined the Mob onstage for an electrifying performance of their widely popular single “Black Beatles,” featuring a shirtless crowdsurfing Swae Lee. Hip-hop crooner D.R.A.M. graced the stage for just one song later in the show for a collaborative rendition of “Gilligan” with A$AP Rocky.
The night was one that could be adequately described as a mosh trance. The Mob has a Beatles-like effect on their fans — one that thrives off of the intersection of music, aesthetics and personality. From beginning to end, the Mob’s show encouraged a kind of consensual chaos that can only be achieved through the crowd’s impeccable chemistry with the artists. It is an experience for the uninhibited and the devoted. Luckily for A$AP Mob, its vast following can very well be described as both.

Photo of Erick Guerrero from USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work website.
A USC graduate student filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the University and associate professor Erick Guerrero, accusing the professor of sexual harassment and alleging that the University did not take stringent enough action against him.
The suit stated that 34-year-old graduate student Karissa Fenwick was sexually harassed by Guerrero on Jan. 12 in his hotel room at an academic conference in New Orleans. Guerrero was Fenwick’s dissertation advisor and has worked with her on various research projects.
The lawsuit also alleged that Guerrero had harassed another student, identified as Student X, beginning in 2011.
Guerrero filed a demurrer to the Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday denying all the allegations in the lawsuit. He also filed an answer to the complaint.
In the complaint, Fenwick alleged that Guerrero attempted to have sex with her at the conference in January. 
“Guerrero put his hands on the sides of [Fenwick’s] arms as she walked past and guided her over to his bed, where he then sat her down and quickly leaned in for a kiss,” the lawsuit alleged. 
The complaint said that after Fenwick refused his advances, Guerrero threatened her in order to keep her from telling anyone about the incident, saying that the dean would not take her side if she took the complaint to the administration.
Fenwick reported the alleged Jan. 12 incident to the USC Office of Equality and Diversity around Jan. 19, the suit said. The OED launched an investigation afterward.
Guerrero’s answer to the complaint claimed no one was ever on the bed. He said he believes the complaint was filed in retaliation after he suggested that Fenwick find another dissertation chair after the conference when they were both in a bar in New Orleans.
In the document, Guerrero stated that Fenwick “began to dance with Dr. Guerrero provocatively and displayed inappropriate engagement, backing up into him and trying to rub her buttocks on him.”
According to the complaint, Guerrero contested the case by submitting additional evidence to the OED and said he was sexualized by students at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. He claimed he was referred to as “the hot Latino professor.”
Martin Levine, vice provost and senior adviser to the provost, sent a letter to Guerrero on Sept. 7 announcing his suspension without pay for one semester beginning in Fall 2018. 
“The Provost regards your offenses as sufficiently serious that he considered bringing charges leading to your dismissal,” Levine wrote. “If there is another charge of sexual harassment or retaliation, your dismissal will be reconsidered.”
The Daily Trojan obtained the letter from John Winer, Fenwick’s attorney. Guerrero confirmed this was the letter he received from the University on Sept. 7. 
The letter to Guerrero also stated there were multiple offenses and that he “attempted to dissuade a complainant from reporting an incident.”
The document also added that Guerrero would be suspended from teaching doctoral students, serving on doctoral committees, holding leadership positions or receiving salary bonuses until the end of the 2019-20 academic year. On Wednesday, however, USC said in statement emailed to the Daily Trojan that Guerrero will no longer teach or supervise students starting this academic year.
“In accordance with our policies, a financial penalty was imposed, he was barred from leadership positions, his office was relocated away from students, and he will not teach classes or supervise students for the current academic year and beyond,” the statement said. “The University is reviewing the recent legal filings to determine if additional action is warranted.”
Fenwick said in an interview with the Daily Trojan that she decided to come forward publicly with her suit after realizing the University still allowed Guerrero to interact with and teach students — disciplinary action which she found insufficient.
“Based on the sanctions, the message that came from the top of the school is that if you’re [a faculty member], you’re allowed to sexually harass, threaten and then lie about students,” Fenwick said.  “The University will acknowledge that those things happen, but they will still allow faculty to keep their jobs.” 
Guerrero said in an email to the Daily Trojan that he has been responding to Fenwick’s allegations for nearly 10 months.
“It is sad to see that some people take advantage of a serious issue to continue their lives of white privilege,” Guerrero wrote. “I am here and I am not going anywhere.”
The complaint also stated that from 2011 to 2013, Guerrero made unwanted sexual advances and comments toward Student X, who wished to remain anonymous. In addition, it mentioned that the student reported the incident to a faculty member, but it was never investigated by USC.
“I was not aware of the extent of his harassing behavior toward the previous student,” Fenwick said. “There were just some rumors and open secrets … If I had specifically known what those things were, then I would not have made the choice [to work with him].” 
Guerrero said he would have never put his position as a social worker in jeopardy, and that he will continue to contest the lawsuit.
“I have peace of mind that things will be cleared out after the facts are revealed,” Guerrero wrote. “I am living the American Dream and I am confident that this will end well for my family.”
Fenwick and her attorney will speak publicly on Thursday morning.
“We hope that Karissa coming forward will motivate other women to come forward,” Winer said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “USC seems to have a problem with sexual harassment.”
Statement from USC:
Statement from Erick Guerrero:
“It is sad to see that some people take advantage of a serious issue to continue their lives of White privilege.
Please note that I have been responding to these false allegations for almost ten months.  I am here and I am not going anywhere. The allegations in the complaint are false and I have answered them in court this afternoon.  I respect that the court process will be rigorous and fair for everyone. I have peace of mind that things will be cleared out after the facts are revealed.
I have been a social worker in a female dominated profession for 20 years and have committed my career to promote equity and empower vulnerable groups. I would never put myself in a compromising situation that can take away all the things I have worked so hard to accomplish. I am proud to be one of few Mexican-American Professors with tenure at a world class University. I married my dream partner, Emma who is also a USC professor and we are blessed now to have a six-month old baby girl.  I am living the American Dream and I am confident that this will end well for my family.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: Some comments have been removed because they violate the Daily Trojan’s comment policy: https://dailytrojan.com/info/
I find it very interesting that the positive comments in support of the professor are being moved lower in the comments section. Biased article? interesting usc.
I am saddened by these claims against a professor that is very respected on our campus. Myself and many other students have always respected Dr. Erick Guerrero, and will continue to do so. He is a great professor, and these allegations are clearly being blown out of proportion. And btw, he is KNOWN around campus as the “hot latino professor.” No one actually knew that he knew about this though lol. So everyone needs to calm down, because you are ruining this man’s career. DON’T JUDGE and accuse him of things that the court will hopefully judge fairly! Its not easy to get a phd and keep up the publications that he does. Do not comment on here and bring down someone when nothings even been decided. Its all “he said, she said” at this point. 
And p.s. in the court document it states that the girl accusing him of sexual harassment has had similar issues on other campuses…HMMMM??? coincidence? Hopefully his lawyers follow that lead, im sure things will come up on her.
I just heard that he referred to himself as the hot Latino professor and that he was irresistible to women.  I just saw his picture.  He is completely delusional!
Like others below I felt some sympathy for the guy until he decided to pull the “white privilege” card.  Now, I hope you are collecting unemployment soon.  I don’t care who is telling the truth at this point, you both seem like the typical liberal scum that a “school” like USC produces.
I was sympathizing with the professor (based on the innocent until proven guilty principle) until he pulled the “white privilege” card and lost all credibility.
“It is sad to see that some people take advantage of a serious issue to continue their lives of white privilege,” Guerrero wrote. “I am here and I am not going anywhere.”
-I really wish he wouldn’t have pulled the race card.
