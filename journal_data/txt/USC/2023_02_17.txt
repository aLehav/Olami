USC graduate student workers secured a milestone victory Friday, winning the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining with the University. A decisive 93% of the 1,721 ballots cast were in favor of unionization.
The union, formally known as the Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee, joins the United Auto Workers union which already represents academic workers from the likes of the University of California and Harvard University.
“This was a pretty big victory — a very clear mandate in favor of the union,” said Yoni Hirshberg, a teaching assistant and one of the union’s organizers. “We will meet USC as equals at the bargaining table.”
Both the union and University have five days to file objections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board. If neither files, the board will certify the results and the University must begin bargaining in good faith with the union.
All teaching assistants, assistant lecturers, research assistants, students funded through training grants and fellows in STEM disciplines at USC are eligible to join the union.
“USC fully supports our graduate students and respects their decision to be represented by a union,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Friday. “We recognize the important role they play at the university and are proud that we provide stipends and benefits for our graduate students that already are very competitive with those of our peers … We are committed to bargaining in good faith to reach a fair contract.”

Voting began Wednesday to decide the fate of a prospective union of USC graduate student workers, formally called the Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee. The two-day election will close Thursday at 7 p.m., decided by a simple majority vote of union-eligible workers.
A National Labor Relations Board official said that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the board will count the votes on Friday and should have a rough idea of the result that day — which seems likely to be a “yes” on unionization given that roughly 60% of 3,400 workers signed union authorization cards in December.
“It’s great to get graduate stipends and things like that, and I’m really grateful,” said Marina Massidda, a graduate student studying cinema and media who voted in favor of unionization. “But [USC] pitches it as something you can live on when really it’s not, increasingly so at a rapid pace; it’s just not in step with inflation and rent costs.”
The GSWOC, seeking to join the United Auto Workers union, represents teaching assistants, assistant lecturers, research assistants, students funded through training grants and fellows in STEM disciplines.
Voting commenced simultaneously at Wallis Annenberg Hall on the University Park Campus, the Clinical Services Center on the Health Sciences Campus and Drexler Auditorium at the Buck Institute.
“USC values its good relations with the unions already representing some USC employees, including our food service workers,” wrote Andrew Stott, vice provost for academic programs and dean of the Graduate School, in a January memo. “But USC does not believe that representation by the United Auto Workers is in the best interest of our graduate students.”

The fate of a prospective union of USC graduate student workers will hinge on a Feb. 15-16 election, the National Labor Relations Board confirmed in a notice Wednesday. A simple majority vote of union-eligible workers will decide the outcome.
Negotiations last month between USC and the coalition — formally named the Graduate Student Workers Organizing Committee — defined union-eligible workers as all teaching assistants, assistant lecturers, research assistants, students funded through training grants and fellows in STEM disciplines.
“We are united in a belief that by banding together we can have greater support and better lives,” the GSWOC wrote in a Monday press release. “With a union, we can address problems like earning less than a living wage, insufficient healthcare benefits, discrimination, bullying and harassment, and a lack of legal and structural support for international workers.”

USC and a prospective union of graduate student workers tentatively set the dates of a union election for Feb. 15 and 16. The NLRB still needs to draft the formal agreement, which will require both parties’ signatures.

The agreement came after a second day of hearings with the labor board, which defined which workers are eligible to join the union.


Next month’s election will hinge on a simple majority vote of union-eligible workers. The group seems likely to vote in favor of unionization given that roughly 60% of 3,400 workers signed union authorization cards to trigger the hearing in December.

A prospective union of USC graduate student workers will likely hold a hearing with the National Labor Relations Board starting Wednesday, a union representative wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Friday.
The hearing — which will determine workers’ union eligibility — would bring the coalition one step closer to official union certification and allow the workers to strike in the future.
The University is expected to argue at the hearing that graduate student workers funded through fellowships are not employees and therefore not union-eligible, wrote Megan Cassingham, a spokesperson for the Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee. Spokespersons for USC were not immediately able to confirm Cassingham’s assertion or the scheduled date for the hearing.
After the hearing, the NLRB will set the date of an election decided by a simple majority of union-eligible workers who are likely to vote in favor of unionization, given that roughly 60% of 3,400 workers signed union authorization cards to trigger the hearing in December.

A broad coalition of USC graduate student workers filed for a union election Wednesday, a move that could grant the workers the power of collective bargaining — and the strike — in labor negotiations with the University.
Any strike would be far out, if one happens at all. The prospective union of graduate students employed as teaching assistants, research assistants and assistant lecturers from nearly every academic department will likely go through an early January hearing with the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that protects the rights of private-sector employees.
The hearing would confirm which workers are eligible to join the union, a point that the University could contest; if USC agrees with the coalition’s definition of an eligible member, the hearing would not be necessary.

Students gathered at the new Annenberg building Thursday night to hear from the five executive tickets running for Undergraduate Student Government President and Vice President — the largest group of candidates in recent history — in a debate hosted by Annenberg Media. Tickets present at the debate are: Yoav Gillath and Monica Rodriguez; Miko Mariscal and Andrew Taw; Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu; Devin Ayala and Navya Singh; and Aidan Feighery and Ashley Ka. Moderators asked questions, to which each candidate had the opportunity to respond, followed by questions from the audience.
— EVA HARTMAN
“Drugs are going to be done, let’s make sure it’s as safe as possible,” said Jakatdar, who said she has friends who have found fentanyl in their drugs. She and Lu said it was important to maintain a relationship with UPIFC to mandate test strips and NARCAN at events.
An earlier version of this update misattributed the quote to Singh.
Mariscal and Taw proposed EBT and CalFresh workshops.
“USG is not viewed as the best partner” for initiatives on food insecurity, Feighery said, instead saying he and Ka will support existing student efforts.
Gillath and Rodriguez pointed to the Trojans Give Back organization for donating unused meal swipes and dining dollars to unhoused people, which they said they had founded.
Jakatdar and Lu called for more affordable halal and kosher options on campus.
Jakatdar and Lu want to keep masks available and expand hybrid options for classes.
Ayala and Singh said they want to maintain daily emails containing case counts from the University, and expand Student Health programs on sexually-transmitted disease and flu testing.
Feighery, who said he is immunocompromised, called for more accessibility, particularly in hybrid classes.
“This pandemic is not over for everyone,” Feighery said.
“Look both ways, people!” Gillath said, jokingly, before acknowledging that very few people pay attention to University directives about where to walk and bike. He and Rodriguez said they were not sure whether addressing collisions was “something we have the power to do,” instead calling on students to “exercise common sense.”
Jakatdar and Lu said they want to see medical supply vending machines on campus to be used in case of collisions.
“This is very personal to me: I was hit by a scooter this year,” Ayala said, proposing more bike lanes.
Feighery and Ka were the only ticket to note that the ONE Safety Vision signs planted throughout Trousdale Parkway were removed today, saying students had appreciated them.
“Spring admits and transfers are no less deserving of our welcome,” Feighery said.
He and Ka said they will encourage RSOs to actively reach out to spring admits and transfer students.
Mariscal and Taw proposed a club resource guide to help commuter students plan ahead in traveling to and from USC.
Ayala and Singh, both spring admits, said they were concerned that housing is not guaranteed for transfer students.
Feighery and Ka said their platform is of a tighter scope than that of other candidates and is therefore feasible.
Mariscal and Taw said all of their campaign promises “can be done in one year.”
Feighery and Ka called for more diversity in USG leadership positions and collaboration across cultural organizations.
Gillath and Rodriguez focused more on supporting the communities surrounding the University, calling for more restaurant crawls to promote local businesses.
Ayala and Singh, the latter being the current vice president of judicial affairs of the USC Panhellenic Council, said they want to work with the Panhellenic Council and the executive board of the University Park Interfraternity Council to create lines of communication and on joint initiatives.
“If we ostracize and alienate members of fraternities or members of UPIFC, that is the exact thing we cannot do,” Ayala said. “They’re not going to want to compromise. They’re not going to want to work with Panhellenic, USG or the University.”
Feighery and Ka referenced their open letter calling for campus action on sexual assaults published Wednesday night.
“We are behind square one,” Feighery said.
The Instagram posts need to stop, Mariscal and Taw said. They called on USC to support those who cannot return home because of the crises.
Feighery and Ka said they wanted to advocate for international students facing financial crises, specifically by helping them stay over the summer. Feighery pointed out that there are no international students in USG Senate.
 “We are behind our peer institutions in this,” Ka said. 
Ayala and Singh proposed expanding the SCÜP shuttle to LAX, with new drop off and pick up spots, and a shuttle back to campus.
“This is beyond funding; this is foundational,” the ticket said. “A lot of the projects USC is doing are projects already done by the Environmental Student Assembly.”
Gillath and Rodriguez proposed installing a sustainability chair in USG.
Jakatdar and Lu said they wanted to examine current hiring and diversity, equity and inclusion protocols — including more accurate representation of the community that DPS has jurisdiction over in the hiring committee.
Ayala and Singh proposed developing a program for licensed clinicians to accompany DPS dispatches. A Mental Health Assistance and Response Team already exists.
Feighery and Ka want to centralize an accountability and reporting system to improve the Yellow Jacket program.
Gillath and Rodriguez proposed “Mental Health Mondays” with puppies and goat yoga. The Mariscal-Taw ticket responded and said puppies and yoga aren’t “a long-term solution,” and instead want to highlight existing resources and expand resources available in USC’s cultural centers.
Jakatdar and Lu proposed developing a commuter mental health program and creating a physical space on campus dedicated to mental health with resources, food and nap pods. The ticket also wants to expand free therapy sessions for students.
Feighery-Ka said they want to be more forthright with funding.
“When we don’t provide the resources to the folks who know exactly what to do about their own community in the first place,” Feighery said, “we’re doing a bad job of supporting those students.”
Gillath and Rodriguez said they will hire more Indigenous students, and also proposed implementing funding transparency.
Jakatdar and Lu proposed increasing education for USC students on Native American issues.
Mariscal and Taw listed every tribe in the area.
“[Indigenous people] may be a small population on our campus, but they’re extremely mighty,” Mariscal said. “You should already know these organizations and these reservations and people that deserve to be heard.”
“USC has so many unique strengths as an educational institution that can be used [for a positive impact],” Feighery and Ka said. “[We will] provide help to RSOs doing good work in the community.”
Gillath and Rodriguez said they want their “Trojan Partners” program to directly link RSOs and the community.
“I’m a South Central native: I know about the hostility between the community and the University,” Rodriguez said.
Jakatdar and Lu said they will encourage volunteering in the community.
“We don’t want to assume that we’re the ones who know the solutions,” Jakatdar said.
Mariscal and Taw wanted to encourage the USC community to “engage in conversations about gentrification and racism.”
“USC is in the backyard of South Central, not the other way around,” Ayala and Singh said.

The recent switch to shared Fryfts, USC’s impact on the South Central community, fraternity disaffiliation, mental health, drug abuse and sexual assault were all hot-button issues highlighted in the two-and-a-half-hour Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate held Thursday night at Wallis Annenberg Hall, hosted by Annenberg Media.
Students gathered to hear from the five executive tickets running for 2023-2024 USG president and vice president, the largest group of candidates in recent history.
Tickets present were: Yoav Gillath and Monica Rodriguez; Miko Mariscal and Andrew Taw; Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu; Devin Ayala and Navya Singh; and Aidan Feighery and Ashley Ka. Annenberg co-executive editors Charlotte Phillipp and Nataly Joseph moderated the debate.
The Feighery-Ka and Gillath-Rodriguez tickets said they saw registered student organizations as key to effective change on and off campus, and said that they would prioritize partnership between USG and RSOs if elected.
“USC has so many unique strengths as an educational institution that can be used [for a positive impact],” Feighery and Ka said, explaining their plan to support existing outreach projects on campus instead of investing funds into new USG initiatives that may not be as effective. 
Gillath and Rodriguez explained their plan for a new “Trojan Partners” program to directly link RSOs and the community, while the Mariscal-Taw and Ayala-Singh tickets both called for increased conversations on USC’s campus about gentrification in South Central. 
To promote mental health awareness on campus, Gillath and Rodriguez proposed “Mental Health Mondays” with puppies and goat yoga. The Mariscal-Taw ticket responded and said puppies and yoga aren’t “a long-term solution.” The ticket, instead, wants to highlight existing resources and expand resources available in USC’s cultural centers.
Jakatdar and Lu proposed developing a commuter mental health program and creating a physical space on campus dedicated to mental health with resources, food and nap pods. The ticket also wants to expand free therapy sessions for students.
Candidates touched on Greek life and the disaffiliation of fraternities. All candidates agreed Greek organizations have a place at the University and the best path forward is through collaboration on the issues of sexual assault and drug overdose. 
Ayala and Singh, the latter being the current vice president of judicial affairs of the USC Panhellenic Council, said they want to work with the Panhellenic Council and the executive board of the University Park Interfraternity Council to create lines of communication and on joint initiatives.
“If we ostracize and alienate members of fraternities or members of UPIFC, that is the exact thing we cannot do,” Ayala said. “They’re not going to want to compromise. They’re not going to want to work with Panhellenic, USG or the University.”
Jakatdar, a member of Greek life, recounted how her friends had previously found fentanyl in their drugs. She and Lu reiterated that maintaining a relationship with UPIFC was crucial to drug safety on campus. 
“Drugs are going to be done,” Jakatdar said. “Let’s make sure it’s as safe as possible.” 
Current USG president Hannah Woodworth compared each candidate’s plans to address student concerns with the Fryft program, noting that the campaign presented by Mariscal and Taw, the only non-senators running, was also the only one that did not address Fryft.
Feighery and Ka appealed to feasibility to defend their platform, explaining that the University has stated that it will not return to a single-rider Fryft program. They proposed, instead, to implement a policy for limited single rides and unlimited shared rides. 
Gillath offered a different perspective to Fryft changes, remembering that the University has, in the past, backtracked its decisions, such an initial aversion to the meal swipe donation program he pioneered. Both the Gillath and Rodriguez ticket and the Ayala-Singh ticket emphasized the importance of student and parental outcry in changing University policy.
“Parents — throughout the public outcry — can get the university to switch things,” Rodriguez said. 
Jakatdar and Lu proposed adding a $200 transportation fee to student tuition to cover a complete return to free single rider Lyfts.
“We should not be giving you false hope and false promises,” Mariscal said. 
USG voting will open Tuesday and close Feb. 26.

Community members gathered at the University Religious Center courtyard Thursday evening for a vigil remembering those affected by the destructive and deadly earthquake that shook Turkey and Syria Monday. The area was lit up with candles as attendees mourned together at the event hosted by USC Student Affairs. 
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni led the event, at which students, faculty and staff shared their personal experiences and offered words of encouragement.
“We come together with our confusion and our despair to make sense of the senseless and to find hope in the hopeless,” Soni said in his opening speech. “More than anything else, we come together to be together at a time when we need it most. And, so, this evening, we will offer prayers, we will light candles, we will share stories, we will take action and we will stay close to each other.”
In his speech, Jeffery Newell, a therapy trainee at the Student Counseling Center, said there was no “correct way” to deal with emotions. 
“You’re going to have a lot of strong feelings,” Newell said. “They’re going to come and go. Sometimes, they’ll come and stay … That’s all normal within the grieving process. Things like anger, frustration and extreme sadness can all be a part of it, so just kind of try to allow yourself to know that it’s okay. It’s normal.”
Yasir Tutunculer, a fifth-year student majoring in biochemistry who grew up in Istanbul, shared his personal experience with the disaster. When he found out about the earthquake, Tutunculer called his loved ones living in the affected areas who survived the disaster but did not feel safe remaining in the town. 
“Turkey is not a country that hasn’t seen an earthquake before,” Tutunculer said, recalling the 7.6-magnitude earthquake in 1999 that killed 18,000 people. “We grew up with stories of that earthquake and how it felt like the end of the world … Even though I’m a medication technician who has a passion to serve his country, there was little I could do from California.” 
Other speakers at the event were Anthony Bailey, vice provost of strategic and global initiatives; Richard Sunwoo, pastor at Our Savior Parish and USC Caruso Catholic Center; Dave Cohn, USC Hillel executive director; and Anthony Khoory, a senior majoring in sociology and co-director of the Middle Eastern North African Student Assembly.
Individuals from various religious backgrounds — Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim — stepped up to the podium during the vigil to offer prayers and blessings. Despite the differences in faith, students like Hilal Balik, a sophomore majoring in international relations and the global economy, felt moved by the power of togetherness within the common ground of being human.
“I think it was beautiful how they brought speakers from every background possible,” Balik said after the vigil. “There were … age differences, different communities, different religions, different backgrounds. I think that’s what made it more important because they were all talking about how, at the core, we’re all people, and that’s why we’re all supporting as people, not as Turks or people from Syria.”
Following the speeches, Soni invited audience members to share their feelings. Attendees lingered afterward to speak to one another about their struggles and shared pain. Among those who remained was Helin Yilmaz, a junior majoring in data science and health and human sciences whose family friends and relatives were impacted by the earthquake.
“I came here today because I have been feeling this immense amount of grief, and I know that it’s a collective grief,” Yilmaz said. “Here, I was hoping to find others that were sharing this pain because I think that in order to overcome something as severe and as catastrophic as this tragedy was, you have to have a community to support you, and I really did feel that here tonight.”
Various booths set up around the courtyard solicited support for attendees and fundraising for aid efforts in the affected regions. One of the booths offered a QR code to donate to Turkey and Syria, one was open for anyone to come and make appointments with the Counseling Center, and another sold coffee and Turkish delights to raise funds.
“It’s going to take a lot of time for us to be able to return back to whatever is considered normal,” Yilmaz said. “The effects of this tragedy are going to be felt for many years to come in the same way that my parents still feel the impact of the ‘99 earthquake … Right now … we just have to allow ourselves to feel by continuing to support and engage in these efforts to fundraise for donations.”

When the first explosions rang in Kyiv as Russia began invading Ukraine last February, Petro knew he needed to get his family to safety. Living conditions became difficult, with closed shops, constant air raids and blackouts restricting access to water and electricity. Petro quit his work as an internal auditor for a charity foundation, and he and his family gathered their belongings and drove 15 hours to the border with Romania.
“The main reason we left was the safety of our children,” Petro said, speaking through an interpreter. (Petro requested to be quoted under a pseudonym for this article, fearing retaliation should he and his family be forced to return to Ukraine under Russian occupation.) “Our older daughter is five years old and obviously she couldn’t attend kindergarten. We didn’t want her to hear explosions. We didn’t want her to witness the horrors of this war.”
In April, President Joe Biden announced the launch of Uniting for Ukraine, a program allowing Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to reside in the United States under temporary parole, provided they had a sponsor.
But it was a long time before Petro was eligible to apply for the program. In the summer, Petro finally found sponsors through Welcome.US, the self-described “largest coalition in refugee resettlement history,” which initially served Afghan refugees but has since expanded to include Ukraine and Latin America. In October, Home for Refugees, an Orange County-based nonprofit, put Petro in touch with USC Gould School of Law students Uma Fry Demetria and Harut Margaryan and Visiting Clinical Professor of Law Henna Pithia, who helped Petro with the immigration process.
“After I got connected with Uma, Harut and Professor Pithia, everything seemed to be very solid, reliable, and they gave tremendous support in their advice and help with documents,” Petro said. “We had Zoom meetings with the University team and they were very nice to explain to me every step.”
Margaryan, a graduate student studying law, said there were challenges involved in communicating with Petro and his family due to the conditions in Ukraine.
“Before they came here, we got to know their story and spoke to them about logistics,” Margaryan said. “We had some difficulties with potentially not being able to join the Zoom call because there were some bomb threats and they had to go into bunkers, or they didn’t have electricity.”
Margaryan, himself an immigrant from Armenia, felt the urgency in bringing the family to the United States as soon as possible.
“I think it’s important to find a quick way to help them because of the war that’s going on and the dangers posed to them,” Margaryan said. “It was really exciting to finish the work and see them come here so quickly thereafter. For them to have safety and stability here is probably the best part.”
Demetria, a graduate student studying law, said going through the process with Petro and his family was like living it with them, day by day. 
“We were able to build a close relationship and watch this family go through what they were going through. A lot of times it was sort of like a waiting game,” Demetria said. “For example, we had to wait for them to be able to get their bank statements to include it in the application, but the banks were closed in Ukraine because there were air raids going on.”
Herself an immigrant from Nepal, Demetria said her own experience made her more passionate about human rights work and helping others navigate a pathway to citizenship.
“Being able to [help Petro and his family] live a life in safety and have their children be able to go to school again and not be in constant fear for their lives — that’s been the best part for me … knowing that we can make meaningful contributions to someone’s life,” Demetria said.
On Dec. 10, Petro and his family arrived in Los Angeles and were greeted by the University team, sponsors and members of Home for Refugees with the Ukrainian flag. Due to logistical issues, Petro and his family will not be able to meet Margaryan and Demetria in person, but he said he would be excited to meet them and the rest of the university team when given the opportunity. 
“I still can’t believe that our family got so lucky and we got here,” Petro said. “We’re surrounded by so many beautiful people…I am happy to say that Harut, Uma and Professor Pithia are amazing people. They are so nice, friendly, patient and tolerant, and I honestly admire their work and I’m very thankful for all they do.”

A father pushes his young son to play football. The son learns powerful lessons and finds friends he can call brothers, but football isn’t his passion. The son struggles to choose between  sticking to the path his dad laid out for him, and following his dream of going into the film industry.
These are scenes from Peter Filimaua’s upcoming graduate thesis film “Fili,” but they are also reminiscent of his own coming-of-age story. Filimaua, who grew up in a Mexican and Samoan family, sees his filmmaking as a way to give his community more on-screen representation. 
“I only had the Rock to look up to growing up on my Samoan side. I love the Rock, but I think we need more stories of our people,” said Filimaua, a master’s student studying cinematic arts, film and television production. “Any chance I get, I try to tell stories about my people and my community.”
When Filimaua began his thesis project, he took inspiration from his own adolescence and the people he grew up around.
“I always want to put pieces of myself into the story. My dad put me into football at a young age, and I loved it. It was super fun, but I never saw it as a career path,” Filimaua said. “I know a lot of people, my cousins and other people that are facing this dilemma of being pigeonholed into a career path that they may not want to do. I think it’s important to show that there are outlets other than football.”
Actor Joshua Leomiti, who plays the titular character Fili in Filimaua’s thesis film, shared similar experiences.
“[Fili] related a lot to my own life. In Samoan culture and Polynesian cultures in general, a lot of it is sports,” Leomiti said. “We always want to honor our parents and make them happy, and usually sports is the way because that’s supposedly the ticket to success.”
In November, Filimaua received a post-production grant for “Fili” from the Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment, which was presented to him at the inaugural Critics Choice Association Celebration of Asian Pacific Cinema and Television. 
“I was mostly looking for the raw talent first and foremost because whenever we are giving an award … we’re very interested in the longevity because we want to invest in people,” said CAPE Executive Director Michelle K. Sugihara. “That was something that really struck me, how as a director, he worked with his actors and he got the performances that he did.”
Sugihara also said that Filimaua’s work on “Fili” upheld CAPE’s mission to champion diversity and empower Asian American and Pacific Islander artists. 
“[Fili] was a personal story, but one about the Samoan community that maybe hasn’t had a lot of air time historically. That was additive to the decision, certainly,” Sugihara said. “His team is also largely API, which we were very excited about, as well.” 
Leomiti agreed that Filimaua and his crew made him feel at home without tokenizing his Samoan identity. 
“I am just thrilled to be a part of something like this. Just the way Peter brought his team together, it was very professional because … it was like everybody was on their A-game,” Leomiti said. “I’m an artist first … and I do love my culture and my background … but I always saw myself as an artist and I want to be represented that way. I would love to work with Peter again. I think he’s going in the right direction.”
Although Filimaua faced a similar dilemma to his protagonist growing up, his parents encouraged him to follow his dreams of becoming a filmmaker. 
“My mother, she’s an educator … and my dad is a businessman. Coming from where they come from, this was a path that is foreign to them, but they still wanted me to pursue my own dreams and goals,” Filimaua said. “I’ve been very grateful for them in my life and my family supporting me. They push me forward and they root for me.”
“Fili” has given Filimaua the opportunity to diversify the narrative about the Pacific Islander community by sharing his own story.
“I always wanted to see stories about people who looked like me, and I don’t think I got a chance to see that. It was always a white male figure, like a superhero, or in westerns,” Filimaua said. “That’s why I’ve gravitated towards telling stories about my people and making sure the culture is at the forefront, telling stories that younger generations can see and hopefully [think], ‘Oh, that’s me,’ or ‘That’s my story,’ and be inspired to go out and make their own films.”
“Fili” will premiere at USC in May.

Anyone who knows me is probably expecting me to write about a certain “brand” of artists. Taylor Swift, Noah Kahan, Maisie Peters, Lizzy McAlpine and Harry Styles make up my top five on Spotify, but there’s another genre that I subconsciously try to bury in my Wrapped results: pop-punk. 
The angst in the vocals, consistency of the kick drum and intensity of the guitar take me back to the basement of my childhood home, holding a microphone connected to my family’s Xbox 360 with my brother drumming furiously, sweat dripping down his face. 
If “Rock Band” only had two fans, it would have been my brother and me. We had the original version and three sequels, not to mention the LEGO edition. For the four minutes of each song, our only goal was scoring the highest we could, trying to hit every note perfectly. The rest of the world fell away. 
We’d play through the game’s catalog; “Check Yes, Juliet” by We The Kings, OK Go’s “Here It Goes Again” and “Learn To Fly” by the Foo Fighters were some of my favorites. 
I’d watch in awe as my brother played the drums in expert mode and hit every single beat. We’d even have family-wide “Rock Band” nights every now and then, with everyone on their designated instrument. They were the instruments we played in real life too; There was rarely a day I’d come home from school and not hear my oldest brother playing the drums or my other brother playing the guitar. I’d sing every chance I got: at school, in my room and in the shower. Music had such a strong presence in my family that our 2009 Christmas card featured it, with me at a microphone and my brothers to the left at their respective instruments, all of us donning Santa hats. 
I’d even play with my brother’s friends, as any youngest sibling would. I remember his friends laughing at a nine-year-old singing some of these songs, but I didn’t really understand the comedic effect of my youth. Imagine a kid singing, “We can have some more / Nature is a whore / Bruises on the fruit / Tender age in bloom” from Nirvana’s “In Bloom.” But I had no idea what it meant. I was just happy to be there. 
There’s not a lot for a nine-year-old and a 17-year-old to bond over, but music was a gateway to building our connection. I have a strong memory of my brother calling me into his room one day to listen to a pop-punk cover of Swift’s “Love Story.” I was amazed at how my two musical worlds could blend so seamlessly with my brother’s help. 
I can remember a couple of times when he’d get into a fight with my parents and go for a drive, bringing me along. We’d listen to pop-punk, rock and even screamo music — something I still surprisingly find comforting today — as he talked about the woes of being a high schooler and gave me warnings for when it was my turn. 
Some songs discreetly made their way into my psyche, becoming anthems of sorts. While I could barely comprehend songs with lyrics that involved deep metaphors, some of them, such as “The Middle” by Jimmy Eat World and “Move Along” by The All-American Rejects, were clear enough for my young brain to understand. 
“It just takes some time / Little girl, you’re in the middle of the ride / Everything, everything will be just fine,” Jimmy Eat World sings. It’s timeless and will always ring true. Something about my personal nostalgia of pop-punk and the message of these lyrics is more comforting than any Taylor Swift song could be for me. 
Paramore’s Feb. 10 release, “This Is Why,” is another recent reminder of my love for the genre. I would beg my brother to use his Xbox credits to download women-sung songs to the “Rock Band” database, something the game was seriously lacking. Paramore quickly became one of the bands with a woman lead I looked up to the most. “That’s What You Get” and “crushcrushcrush” come to mind. 
Until recently, I thought of pop-punk music as something I had grown out of. Every time one of these songs would emerge from my Liked Songs on Spotify, I’d skip them almost instantly because I didn’t want to skew my Wrapped results. But this past summer, I started letting them play during aimless drives around my hometown — embracing the nostalgia and connecting with my inner child. 
So, while pop-punk doesn’t exactly fit into the collection of music artists I’ve curated as my brand, it’ll always be in my rotation. Besides, sticking to one genre is utterly boring, and I’m ready to move past that.

A.I.M by Kyle Abraham, a New York-based contemporary dance group, brought their renowned performance, “An Untitled Love,” to USC Wednesday night. With both strength and gentility, their dance represented the intensity, vulnerability and endurance of love. 
Catherine Kirk started her journey with A.I.M as a part-time dancer and performer in 2013. One year later, she joined A.I.M’s Dancer Development Program, which offered dancers to “learn more about behind-the-scenes work and administration.” Since then, she began to experiment with administration and marketing at Abraham’s company. 
“The work was relatively organic,” Kirk said. “Over the years, I’ve kind of transitioned in and out as I become more committed and busier as my role as a dancer.”
Managing A.I.M on Instagram and other external communications, Kirk soon discovered both a sense of audience and, more importantly, A.I.M’s voice among all the performers and art groups online. As she became more experienced, her role as a communicator extended beyond bodily movements to the digital landscape. Navigating a personal life, a dancer’s life, as well as a marketer’s life, Kirk expressed the core of all such disciplines lies in expression. Through dance, she enlivens the freedom to express herself, feel others and love.
For Martell Ruffin, the lead dancer of “An Untitled Love,” joining Kyle Abraham’s A.I.M was a surreal experience.  
“[My interview] was on the phone and it was with Catherine Kirk, and it was very much an improv freestyle dialogue,” Ruffin said.
In vivid details and with delight, Ruffin reflected on his journey to A.I.M. Prior to onboarding, he took on commercials, theatrical roles, choreographers and various freelancing roles. Joining Abraham and his firm has given Ruffin many valuable opportunities to grow as a dancer, choreographer and performer in a team.
 Kirk and Ruffin both remarked that performing at A.I.M is anchored in organic collaboration. Each one can participate in the artistic development, from creative inception to the final performance. Working with the costume designer, producer manager, artistic director and general manager, as well as the PR, marketing and development teams, Kirk specifically underscored the growing nature of A.I.M since she joined the team 10 years ago.
Transitioning through the pandemic phase, A.I.M has traveled and performed at many cross-country venues, including USC’s own Bovard Auditorium. Their last appearance at USC was their 2022 winter intensive program at Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, where Abraham and his company showcased a variety of artistic voices. Throughout this five-day program, students, aspiring dancers and professional dancers alike joined in this conversation of artistic creation.
One participant of the A.I.M winter intensive program is Hayden Rivas, a student pursuing a Master of Studies in law and a B.F.A. in dance. Rivas has shadowed Abraham personally and participated in the program for two years. He was still impressed when Abraham offered him free access to the program and considered applicants by asking how their choreographic voices had shifted throughout the last year. Rather than the technicality of skills, Abraham shows interest in individuals, as seen through the ongoing collaborative process of the creation of “An Untitled Love,” where he asked each dance crew to contribute and create together. A.I.M is a Black-owned company that advocates for Black lives, it is this dedication to inclusivity that has inspired Rivas to further pursue multidisciplinary studies to “tell stories that are personal and tell stories that are vulnerable because that’s the power of art.”
In addition to their artistic journey as performers, balancing work and life also presents considerable challenges for touring performers like Kirk and Ruffin. Due to the pandemic, taking care of one’s own physical and mental wellbeing has received tremendous amounts of attention. For both, the toll falls on their shoulders to navigate and manage. Kirk commented on how tours and work might be heavy, yet the motivation for expression and the delight for artistic creation hold them close and lead them on.
“A.I.M for Change” is a social justice initiative that offers resources and support for Black lives in areas including mental health, anti-racism, relief grants and more started in 2020 to “look for more activation in action,” Kirk said.
She also commented that the role of reflection was central to how life, art, and justice can be intertwined. 
“One of the things I loved early in watching dance was how much I learned about myself. The prejudices I have, the beliefs I have,” Kirk said. “I had to realize that that’s my own projection of life and reality.”
“The audience member has to decide for themselves what that piece means for them, even if they’re wondering what it means for us or what it meant to Kyle,” Kirk said. “You’re gonna walk away with your own perspective kind of portrayed back at you.”

The dining hall food is bad. The lines are long. Your roommates are filthy. People eat like toddlers. Our lives are truly difficult, my fellow spoiled children. But let’s practice something from now on. You can do it! I believe in you! Brace yourself: quit complaining and be more grateful.
Hear me out first. I am just as guilty. I don’t think I can count the number of times I have complained about how long the dining hall lines are or how the wonderful people I live with let the trash in our bathroom overflow and just stare at it. Yes, it can be frustrating, annoying, irritating — you get the point. 
Take a minute to think about it. When you see your bathroom looking as good as new, do you ever stop to think, “Wow! I’m so grateful for whoever cleaned this”? As you stand in the long line waiting for your burrito bowl, do you think “They are really working so hard to make sure we can all eat and not leave us hangry”? As you pull your laptop out in your study lounge, eager to get in the studying zone (aka watch HBO Max), do you ever say to your friend who is also “studying,” “The tables are so clean today”?
Often, our first response when things aren’t exactly the way we want them to be is to complain. But when things are the way we want them to be, we do not think about the faces or the names of the people that made it happen. We just assume it’s supposed to be this way because the “world definitely revolves around us.”
I hate to break it to you, if you haven’t figured it out at this point: The world does not revolve around you. Thank the wonderful humans who cleaned your bathroom, the amazing people who feed your needy selves or the rockstars who work tirelessly to ensure that our school stays clean and sparkly — it’s the least we can do.
Now you might be thinking, isn’t it their job? Don’t they get paid to do this? Yes and yes. But think for a moment about the intensity of the manual labor, long hours and low wages relative to the work. Our wonderful housing and dining hall staff, like Myrna, a USC housing staffer of over 23 years, show up daily to serve the student body. No matter what you do, knowing that people see and recognize you for who you are and what you do is something that would encourage you to keep going at it despite the challenges one might face. 
The dining hall and housing staff are humans, just like us. They make mistakes. They have bad days. Sometimes, some things are just completely out of their control. So, sorry your bathroom in your on-campus dorms is not sparkly. Sorry your sandwich was not made to your liking. Sorry you have to wait in line for an hour for your food. Complain about it; That’s life. But remember, once you finish ranting to your bestie, remember to say, “The staff is amazing” or “They do a great job daily.”
My fellow pampered Trojans, I got some action steps for you and me: remember, I’m just as guilty. But it’s time to turn a new leaf; so, why not do it together? Greet any housing or dining staff you see, learn their names, ask how they are doing, thank them for what they do and leave some uplifting words from time to time. Take a moment of your day today, tomorrow, next week and have a conversation with them. I can assure you one thing: you’ll learn something about them as much as they’ll learn about you.
If I’ve had your attention for more than a minute, that means we’re besties at this point. So, besties, let’s celebrate our lovely and phenomenal housing and dining hall staff. Use my steps and don’t just let it go out the other ear. Gratitude matters more than you think and while it’s a cheesy statement, treat other how you’d want to be treated. It doesn’t take much, just a sprinkle of kindness.

Dear Anthem,
My editor gives me a maximum of 1,000 words a column, so let me just get straight to the point: Exactly where the fuck do you get the audacity? 
Every year, you try to pull the same bullshit and deny me critical heart medicine, and every year, I have to fight to get it approved again — even though you’ve approved it for the past four years. It usually takes hours on the phone, multiple prior authorizations and letters from my doctor and a peer-to-peer for you to approve it. Once again. For another year. 
But this year, your bullshit almost crushed me. 
The first day of the year rolled around and I attempted to refill my prescription for Corlanor. The pharmacy told me you mixed up my primary and secondary insurance. Shocker. For maybe the quadrillionth time I called you to sort it out, missing class again while on hold being bounced from agent to agent for 70 minutes. You assured me it was all squared away and that I could go pick up my Corlanor, and sure enough, the pharmacy said nothing’s changed. 
Then you outright deny it. Big surprise. We’re both aware it’s insanely expensive, so you tell me to take the “comparable medication propranolol,” which you know I tried four years ago and it nearly made me lose my consciousness, hence why you approved the fucking Corlanor.
It doesn’t seem to even register to you that I’m a chronically ill, complex patient with five overlapping medical conditions for which I take a carefully-crafted long list of medications and infusions. You know this, at least I thought so, because it’s your job. But no, each time it’s:
Doctor to Pharmacy: “She needs this medicine – no substitutions.”
Pharmacy to Insurance: “Her doctor says she needs this medicine.”
Insurance to Pharmacy: “Does she though? Let’s ask her doctor.”
And around we go.
After finally bypassing the absolute atrocity that is the CoverMyMeds portal — the third-party website Anthem makes you use to submit prior authorizations — my mom, nurse and I collectively spend another 70 minutes on the phone being bounced between Denise, Melanie, Tavarum and Giselle, who all make me repeat the same story, only for Giselle to tell us they “never received any submission of a prior authorization.” What in the reverse-psychology hellscape is this?
Meanwhile, without medication, I’m out of breath walking up the stairs and my heart is pounding so loud I can hear it in my ears like some nightmare ASMR. I have one fail safe option and I decide to use it because I can barely make it to class: my emergency box of Corlanor I bought from Canada last year when you left me without medication — again. 
I’ve heard about people buying insulin from Mexico or moving to the UK to get free healthcare, but never in my life did I think I’d be a part of that growing number of Americans outsourcing medication from another country out of utter desperation. I don’t recommend this as this formulation had new side effects, but when the price is $600 to $2,000 in the United States and only $30 in Canada, and you corner me like this, I’m left with no choice.
Ultimately, this process took three weeks and, in the end, you approved me for a dose lower than what I was on last year. 
The worst part is I found out that you were supposed to mail me a letter in December of last year asking if I simply wanted to renew my prior authorization from 2022 to 2023, and all I had to do was respond “Yes” and I’d have had a seamless transition with no interruption of care to this year. You never sent it and even admitted to not sending it. A “clerical error.”
I go through the exhausting trouble of telling you this story because you don’t see what this ordeal did to me psychologically, and you never will, and I can’t live with the fact that you make money off of that too. 
This stunt you pulled in January sent me into a deep depression because I realized I had no control of my body. My bodily autonomy depends on if you approve life-sustaining medications I need. I plead and I wait for someone to help me resolve this so I can simply live. I am beholden to you and you exploit it. 
Can you imagine how that feels? To feel like your body is unworthy of life because Big Brother is denying you access to medication that allows you to live? To feel like the quality of your bodily health is controlled by someone who only sees you as a case number? I’m pretty sure there isn’t a medication to treat that feeling — and if there is, I bet you took it off formulary on Jan. 1. 
I write this not for pity, acknowledgement or sympathy; I write this because I live this. I share this with you, Anthem, to record the facts of what is happening to the people you claim to serve. Yes, you approved Corlanor in the end, but at an inhumane cost to me.
This is why I sincerely ask: Where do you get the audacity? What would happen if I didn’t have the resources to fight this? If I didn’t have my mom calling you while I’m in class, my doctor writing exhaustive letters, his sweet nurse fighting you on her day off and people who love me telling me not to give up? What would I do? The twisted thing is you know exactly what would happen — I would be forced to give up taking the medications that allow me to live which makes you more money. 
Don’t even tell me you’re doing the best you can, because you aren’t. I don’t want to hear that you’re struggling because Anthem made a record $144 billion in 2022. 
I know that the one thing I cannot do is stay silent, for myself and for the millions of people to whom this happens every day. Sometimes, that’s your only recourse when someone hurts you: to make your hurt and suffering known. To share that pain. To redistribute it to its rightful owner. At the very least, to be loud and make it known.
It’s a fact that you put millions of Americans through this every day, and you know that oftentimes what kills patients such as me isn’t our illness — it’s waiting on a prior authorization from you. 
Sincerely,
Do better

Graduate forward Rokia Doumbia and the Trojans look to repeat their success against Stanford as they continue their postseason push. (Brooks Taylor | Daily Trojan)
After back-to-back wins last week against Oregon and Oregon State, the women’s basketball team jumped into the AP Top 25 for the first time this season. The Trojans will now look to continue the hot streak in a critical matchup on Friday against No. 3 Stanford.
The Trojans upset the Cardinal, who were ranked No. 2 in the country at the time, in a 55-46 victory earlier this season. The matchup, which took place at Galen Center, was fairly one-sided, as the Trojans never trailed. The Trojans shot 42.1% from the 3-point line to Stanford’s 19% and forced seven more turnovers, which helped USC seal the nine-point victory. 
“We know it’s going to be tough. They’re so good,” said second-season Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re a better team than when we played them. So, we know we have to bring a top effort and be clicking on all cylinders to try to get a win up there.” 
The one thing the Trojans did not win in their first matchup with the Cardinal was the rebounding battle, getting outrebounded 40-36. Stanford ranks top five in the country in rebounding, led by junior forward Cameron Brink and senior guard Haley Jones, who both average over 9 rebounds per game.
“Gotta box out. I mean, they’re huge. You got to put a body on someone,” Gottlieb said when asked about winning the rebounding battle this time around. “Our aggression level is important because we want to try to get some extra possessions.” 
Forward Cameron Brink (14.5 ppg) and guard Haley Jones (13.3 ppg) have been the driving force of the Cardinal’s success all season long. Both Brink and Jones shot under 25% from the field in the loss to the Trojans in January, and the Cardinal will need both of their stars to flip the script if they want to avoid being swept by USC.
The Trojans, on the other hand ,are led by their star veterans, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko (15 ppg) and graduate guard Destiny Littleton (13.9 ppg). 
Sissoko, who transferred to USC from Minnesota this past offseason, didn’t play in the first meeting between the two squads due to a leg injury. She could be the difference-maker for the Trojans in this upcoming matchup.
Littleton, who transferred to USC this past offseason from South Carolina, led the Trojans with 18 points and 6 assists in their win against Stanford. She looks to have another big performance on Friday. 
“Honestly, just focusing on each possession … and making sure I’m a leader on the court,” Littleton said. “The offensive end is just going to fall for me … so just getting my teammates involved and understanding that this is a really big game and another opportunity to get a great win.”
Stanford has been dominant at Maples Pavilion this season, winning 14 out of 15 home games and 11 in a row. The Cardinal is one of only four teams in the country with 14 home wins this season, so it will be a daunting challenge for USC. However, the Trojans have held their own this season on the road, with a 6-3 record away from Galen Center. Without their home crowd behind them, the Trojans will have to create energy in different ways.
“We have to feed into each other’s energy,” said junior guard Kayla Williams. “So, whoever’s on the floor, the bench has to bring that same energy … We just all have to play with each other, play for each other and back each other up on or off the court?”
The Trojans haven’t made the NCAA Tournament since 2014, but their odds of ending this drought are as promising as ever as they are a projected No. 8 seed in Charlie Creme’s latest Bracketology. An upset against Stanford will make their chances of dancing in March a whole lot better. 
The Trojans will take on Stanford at 8 p.m. Friday at Maples Pavilion.

I’ve only been skiing once. It wasn’t in Vail or Park City or atop any of the iconic mountains skiers call home. It was instead in good ol’ North Carolina, home of Krispy Kreme and aviation and definitely not skiing.
My eight-year-old body was perfectly fit for the bunny hills, where I spent a couple hours learning the ins and outs of a sport I quickly grew to love. Zooming down the 30 degree slopes and “pizza”-ing to come to a stop was a rush that topped the few times I had been sledding on a rare snowy winter day in Tennessee.
With my confidence sky-high, I decided it was time to advance to a real course. I had mastered the bunny hills — they were easy to me now. I needed to scratch my adrenaline-demanding itch and hit the real slopes.
Long story short, I tumbled over again and again and made it to the finish line a revenant, having worried multiple times that a rogue skier might impale me and bring my life to a premature and bitter end.
Skiing is hard. It’s also a sport that is difficult to access because of its high price threshold and reliance on ideal weather conditions. In an effort to challenge some of skiing’s traditional barriers to entry, almost 200 athletes from multiple winter sports are demanding that the International Ski and Snowboard Federation adapt before the repercussions of climate change render the sport unnecessary and unplayable.
In a letter released Feb. 16, FIS athletes noted the increased rate by which competitions had been canceled due to extreme weather events or unseasonably warm weather that prevents snow from sticking around.
“Our sport is threatened existentially and urgently,” the letter read. “That’s why we as a winter sports community have to take the lead in the fight against climate change and make our sport climate neutral as soon as possible.” 
The FIS has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions for all operations and events by 2035. Many of its athletes have now demanded “full transparency” to track the organization’s efforts.
A record-setting warm winter in Europe has forced the FIS to push back the start of the FIS World Alpine Ski Championships. Four of the first five events on the men’s calendar were canceled due to weather, meaning the season didn’t really kick off until late November — a full month after it was slated to begin.
A majority of ski resorts already use artificial snow. Almost 90% of ski resorts in the U.S.-based National Ski Area Association use machines to produce snow, resulting in extra expenses for the resorts and a 20% water loss.
Obviously, it would be ideal for skiers, snowboarders and bobsled teams if a track’s snow came from the sky and not a machine. The increased expense of producing snow would likely drive up the price of admission — widening the wealth gap that already exists in recreational and professional skiing.
Again, I am not a skier and I don’t see myself hitting the slopes anytime soon. However, it is a beloved sport by many and, if a physical activity is taking folks’ attention away from their screens, I will stand behind it. 
Human activity has had a major effect on the global decline in snowfall and ice cover over the past century. Obviously, this has ramifications on humans and animals across the world (like our poor polar bear friends) that are more serious than taking away winter sports. However, as the athletes who signed the list of complaints to FIS stated, sports can serve as a microcosm of greater global issues — as well as an outlet to spread awareness of the global crisis that is being exacerbated by humans.
Mountain communities rely on glacier water runoff for drinking and agriculture purposes. With only 0.04% of the world’s water being deemed drinkable, there are communities across the globe that are suffering from dehydration every day. Over 3.5 million people die every year from water-related diseases. Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Chad and Uganda are among the countries with the least access to clean water. The 20% loss of water produced by snow machines doesn’t seem overly significant, but in a world in which water conservancy is a major issue, every drop counts.
The rate at which glaciers are melting has doubled in the last 20 years, much in part to the increasingly warming climate — a pattern to which humans are a primary contributor.
So, while the FIS should refocus its water conservation efforts and work on lowering its carbon footprint in order to better protect the longevity of winter sports, perhaps the federation (which, admittedly, is not working on an overwhelming profit margin — making around $20 million in 2020) should donate some of its attention and funding to helping communities that couldn’t care less about skiing. Using excess water to make snow is a luxury of wealthy ski communities. There are other communities that see thousands of people die every year because of a lack of access to clean water. 
The winter athletes’ letter to the FIS is a good start in holding organizations accountable for their damaging actions towards the climate. But professional sports organizations should also focus their efforts on helping the world’s most vulnerable communities.

After winning eight straight matches in two tournaments combined, No. 2 USC will play its home opener against No. 6 UC Irvine (7-5) at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Saturday. 
During USC’s 8-0 start, the Trojans have outscored their opponents 123-43. Redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber scored a team-leading 16 goals in that span. The three-time All-American is 14th all-time in goals scored with USC. 
“At the end of the day, it’s not [about] who has the most goals,” Weber said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I was the last one to take the shot, whereas a lot of other people did the dirty work to get me there.”
Redshirt senior drivers Paige Hauschild (10th) and Grace Tehaney (21st) are also ranked high on the all-time scoring list. Hauschild and Tehaney both have 11 goals so far this season. 
USC is led by Head Coach Marko Pintaric, a 15-time NCAA Champion since he started coaching USC in 2001. 
Pintaric and the Trojans have already faced the Anteaters twice this season, once in a scrimmage and again in a 15-8 Trojan victory Feb. 4. In the team’s most recent game against UCI, Tehaney led all players with four goals, and Weber and Hauschild tacked on three more each.
Defensively, senior goalie Carolyne Stern holds down the cage for the Trojans. After averaging 7.4 saves last season, Stern averages 11.3 saves per game this season. 
“We’ve been working on different defensive skills for the players up top to … basically funnel the ball to me,” Stern said. “They’ve done a really good job in helping me out to make those easy blocks.”
Stern will face a UCI team that averages 13.8 goals per game. Redshirt sophomore attacker Elena Flynn leads the Anteaters with 26 goals, while sophomore center Nioka Thomas has scored on 24 of her 29 shots. However, the two managed just one goal combined against the Trojans in their last matchup.
“They’re definitely someone we look forward to playing,” Stern said. “We’ve been really emphasizing our defense the past couple [of] weeks, and I think we’ll pull through this weekend.”
On defense, the Anteaters allowed an average of 8.7 goals per game. Fifth-year goalie Erin Tharp got the lion’s share of time in the cage and has 24 saves on the season. 
Before playing for UCI this year, Tharp played four years with USC and won a championship in 2021 with the Trojans. Against her former team, Tharp did not have a single save and surrendered 15 goals against USC on Feb. 4.  
“It’s going to start on our defense, for sure,” Weber said. “Making sure that we get good stops that will lead into our fast breaks … [We need to be] making sure to finish on high-percentage opportunities.” 
UCI Head Coach Dan Klatt has a 338-173 (.661) record, including a 40-7 all-time record in the Big West Conference.
The Anteaters have an overall record of 7-5 with a 3-5 record against ranked opponents. Against unranked opponents this season, UCI averages 20.75 goals per game. The Anteaters only manage an average of 10.25 goals per game against ranked teams.
The No. 2 Trojans will face the No. 6 Anteaters at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center at 1 p.m. on Saturday. After then, the Trojans will be on the road until March 25 when they play Indiana.
