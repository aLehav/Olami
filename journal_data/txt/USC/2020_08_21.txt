Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante first amazed critics in 2015 with his debut film “Ixcanul” (Volcano), which was selected as the Guatemalan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards. His portrayal of a young Indigenous woman — a subject hardly touched upon in cinema — marks his longtime commitment to representing marginalized groups in Guatemala. 
Continuing this tradition is Bustamante’s third feature “La Llorona,” a horror drama that highlights the struggle of Indigenous peoples in Guatemala. On Wednesday, he and producer Gustavo Matheu led an online screening and live Q&A at the School of Cinematic Arts.  
“La Llorona,” which premiered on Shudder Aug. 6, centers around Enrique Monteverde (Julio Diaz), a retired general responsible for the genocide of thousands of native lxil Mayan people during the early 1980s. As angry and grief-stricken protesters congregate outside of his home, Monteverde’s wife Carmen (Margarita Kenéfic), daughter Natalia (Sabrina De La Hoz) and granddaughter Sara (Ayla-Elea Hurtado) struggle between their familial devotion and their burgeoning realization of the crimes he’s committed. Their only other companion is their loyal housekeeper Valeriana (María Telón) until a mysterious Indigenous maid, Alma (María Mercedes Coroy), arrives.
“Guatemala is a very complicated country if you want to talk about human rights or social rights or independent rights,” Bustamante said. “We don’t have any more dictators, but we continue to have that dictatorial system because we never really cut that, and there are a lot of people defending that [system].” 
Determined to impart the film’s messages to a wider audience, Bustamante and Matheu thus decided to make it a horror film because they knew the genre pulled the biggest box office grosses in Guatemala. 
“As Latin Americans, we have something very natural with magical realism because it’s part of our culture, and La Llorona is also part of our culture,” Matheu said. “And then when they see the movie, they will find out there’s some message behind it; that it’s more deep and more dark and more horrifying than the horror [of the film] itself.” 
Gorgeously shot and written, “La Llorona” stands out among other horror films because of its elegance. Many horror films, especially ones made in the United States, rely on cheap thrills like jump scares and gore rather than an emotionally impactful storyline. “La Llorona,” on the other hand, is a slow rumination on how a family attempts to deny the blatant atrocities their patriarch has committed as well as their complicity in the oppression that Indigenous peoples face. 
What’s particularly impressive about the film is how Bustamante reimagines a figure deeply rooted in Latinx folklore by placing it within the context of the massacres of Indigenous tribes in Guatemala. Bustamante noted how the original folk tale is rather misogynistic. 
“I never understood why La Llorona is so important … it’s a very misogynistic legend, because it’s always a woman crying because some man quit her, and because that man quit her, she’s able to kill her kids,” Bustamante said. “We decided to change that and take La Llorona and transform it.” 
Inspired by the elegant portrayal of Dracula, Bustamante reframed La Llorona as a Mayan woman who underwent unimaginable horrors under Guatemala’s ethnic cleansing. With this unique spin on La Llorona, the movie thus stands in stark opposition to the U.S. film “The Curse of La Llorona,” which not only relied on cheap jump scares and the naiveté of its characters but also whitewashed the legend.  
“La Llorona” was deeply personal for not only Bustamante and Matheu but for the extras, who played as the protesters, as well. 
“They were all from different organizations; they are sons and granddaughters and grandsons who are looking for the missing people from the war in Guatemala and still fighting for the rights of the people who lost their families,” Matheu said. 
Matheu said one of the most emotional scenes for the extras to shoot was one in which the protesters clamor around Enrique, demanding justice for their people. The extras felt that Diaz embodied the real dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, whom the character of Enrique was based on.  
“They didn’t have the opportunity to tell the dictator a lot of things, but in that moment when they were playing the [characters] and they were screaming at him … there was something going on inside them that was very strong,” Matheu said. “People that didn’t have the opportunity to have [closure] were having at that moment.” 
What’s powerful about this film is how the audience comes to realize that the real horror of this film is not the titular “La Llorona” but rather the centuries of oppression and pain the Indigenous tribes have endured in Guatemala. The past never remains in the past but instead lingers constantly, Bustamante argues, until we find the courage to fully confront our bloody histories.

“Full House” actress Lori Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison Friday for her role in the college admissions scandal. In May, Loughlin, along with her husband Mossimo Giannulli pleaded guilty to paying $500,000 in a scheme to admit both of their daughters to USC as athletic recruits.
Hours before Loughlin’s sentencing, Giannulli, a fashion designer, was sentenced to five months in prison for his role in what a U.S. district court judge called “breathtaking fraud.” Though the couple had initially pleaded not guilty, the two accused parents decided to plead guilty in May, after receiving additional charges that carried a maximum sentence of 20 years.
Loughlin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud after an FBI investigation in March 2019 uncovered a widespread scheme where wealthy executives and celebrities paid thousands of dollars to have their children admitted to elite colleges across the country. Prosecutors allege that Giannulli took a more active and involved role in the scheme, resulting in longer jail time. In addition to serving five months, he must also complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $250,000 fine. He reports to prison Nov. 19.
In May, Giannulli and Loughlin admitted to conspiring with college admissions scandal mastermind and real estate mogul William “Rick” Singer to have their daughters, Isabella Giannulli and YouTube personality Olivia Jade, admitted to USC. For months, the couple denied their role in the scheme, saying they thought the bribe money they paid to former USC athletic official Donna Heinel had been legitimate donations to the University.
In addition to paying $500,000, the FBI investigation revealed that the couple also doctored images and misled high school counselors in an effort to portray their daughters as athletic recruits. Both daughters no longer attend USC.
Though more than 10 universities and 30 parents were implicated in Operation Varsity Blues, USC was at the forefront of the scandal and national outrage, having admitted the highest number of students through bribes and having some of the highest profile celebrity cases. Sentencing for parents involved in the scheme ranged from weeks to months. 
Loughlin and Giannulli were the last parents sentenced in the monthslong saga.

This summer, five student leaders at the School of Architecture spent long nights meeting via Zoom drafting plans for discussions with professors and administration to make change within their school’s community. The students, who were either already friends or met through student leadership meetings with Dean Milton Curry, were inspired to take action by the increased activism around the country following the police killing of George Floyd.    
“We were all just having the same thoughts and being like, ‘What can we do? How can we get involved? How can we make change, right now, within our communities that we’re involved in?’” said Abriannah Aiken, president of the Student Association of Women Architects. 
The student leaders wrote a statement to their administration outlining a series of demands and solutions to increase diversity within the school. The June 30 statement was spearheaded by and released through student leaders of three campus organizations: the American Institute of Architecture Students, the National Organization of Minority Architects and the Student Association of Woman Architects. 
“It sort of began as a discussion of the ways we, as student organization leaders, can actively combat racism against Black students and others who are discriminated against,” said Erin Light, one of the program coordinators for SAWA. “Then to use our positions to amplify the experiences of our peers.” 
Light, along with four other student leaders, sent a letter to Curry and other school administrators June 22, explaining their goals and announcing a student survey they had created to gauge student opinion on representation and inclusiveness in the school’s curriculum and learning environment. Curry and Diversity Liaison Esther Margulies both responded to the letter later that day. Within the following days, Curry and Margulies announced and hosted an all-student forum on the topic of diversity June 29.  
The survey received more than 130 responses from both undergraduate and graduate students, who were also asked to share any discriminatory experiences they may have encountered within the school. While the survey’s initial focus was on Black and Indigenous people and people of color, Light observed that discrimination within the school extended beyond just those marginalized groups. 
“After reading so many really constructive responses, not only from BIPOC … but also from women, from LGBTQ people, from international students,” Light said. “We realized from there that it would almost be a disservice to our student body to not address discrimination in all forms.”

“After reading so many really constructive responses, not only from BIPOC … but also from women, from LGBTQ people, from international students,” Light said. “We realized from there that it would almost be a disservice to our student body to not address discrimination in all forms.”
The survey’s results were then used to create the Comprehensive Diversity Initiative, a statement to the School of Architecture’s administration with specific ideas to facilitate more diversity within the school. The initiative comprises six main points, such as increased diversity among faculty and staff and improving accountability for toxic work environments. 
Light said the group placed emphasis on “actionable things that [the] administration can do,” including providing more resources to students, especially in alleviating financial stress that Black and Latinx students reported struggling with. 
To become an architect, students must devote significant time and money to schooling and to obtain a license, contributing to low diversity within the profession itself, Light said. In the United States, only 2% of licensed architects are Black. 
“The major can be very expensive, so one of our [demands] was to get more funding for the software that’s required and more funding for materials that students have to use to build models,” Light said. “This semester, the administration will be paying for Adobe Creative Cloud and Rhino, which is a modeling software, which is going to be really great.” 
The school’s administration has also been receptive and open to suggestions brought up by the initiative’s larger demands, such as the restructuring of curriculum to provide better representation of Black and Indigenous architects and architects of color, Light said. Although steps toward the restructuring have been made through meetings with the dean and professors, course curriculums have yet to be changed. 
“We think [the curriculum] can be more inclusive of diverse architects and focusing on how we, as architects, can start thinking about [how] our designs are impacting the community that we’re designing in,” Aiken said.  “We met with the dean and we proposed all of these things, and he was very much into it, and was very excited [about] working with us and working forward.” 
The student leaders met again with Curry July 13 before presenting the initiative to faculty at a forum two days later. In the weeks following, the student leaders also held meetings with about half of the faculty who plan courses within the school. 
At the time of publication, the school did not elaborate on the meeting they had with student leaders.
NOMAS executive board member Darwin Hu believes architecture students should be aware of their impact in creating spaces that are inclusive of all people and said it was a large guiding principle throughout the creation of the initiative. 
“We have a lot of impact on the built environment that people will live in,” Hu said, “Within our education, we should be very aware of the communities and the histories behind the places we’re going into.” 
Along with urging their peers to understand their influence in designing spaces, the student leaders hoped that the initiative could begin combatting the long-standing racism within their field.
“One of the first things that we were taught in architecture school is that it, as a discipline and as a career, [is one in] which designers are creating spaces to change how people feel when they’re in the space, how they interact with the space or how they interact with each other within the space,” NOMAS co-president Justin Wan said. “I feel like it’s ironic how there are so many problems that are ingrained in our major and in our discipline, and perhaps making a change will create a better learning environment.” 
As student leaders continue to work with administration to fulfill more of their listed demands, they hope that the initiative will remain a lasting part of their respective clubs even after some of the founding members graduate this spring.
“It’s a constantly ongoing effort of listening to people, amplifying their voices and implementing that change,” Light said. “And we want to do that for years to come.”

Fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, who earlier this year admitted to bribing admissions officials and procuring fake athletic recruiting profiles to have his two daughters attend USC, was sentenced Friday to five months in prison for his role in what a U.S. district court judge called “breathtaking fraud.” 
His wife, actress Lori Loughlin, will be sentenced Friday afternoon by the same judge, Nathaniel M. Gorton, in U.S. district court for her part in the admissions scandal. Loughlin could face up to 20 years in prison, though federal prosecutors have recommended the “Full House” actress be sentenced to two months as they believe she played a lesser role than her husband. 
Giannulli pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud and honest services wire and mail fraud Friday. After his release, Giannulli must also complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $250,000 fine. He must report to prison by Nov. 19. 
Giannulli and Loughlin accepted a plea deal in May and admitted to conspiring with college admissions scandal mastermind and real estate mogul William “Rick” Singer to have their two daughters admitted to USC. For months, the couple denied their role in the scheme, saying they believed the bribe money they paid in installments had been legitimate donations to the University. 
The couple paid $500,000 to secure their two daughters’ admission to USC. New documents also reveal that Olivia Jade, their younger daughter and a well-known YouTube personality, had known about the scheme and helped conceal information from her high school guidance counselor. Both daughters no longer attend USC. 
In March 2019, both parents were arrested after an investigation from the FBI called “Operation Varsity Blues” found that wealthy executives and celebrities paid university officials large sums of money to admit their children to elite schools under false pretenses. In early July, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the couple’s request to reduce their bond from $1 million to $100,000.
Though over 10 universities were implicated, USC was at the forefront of the scandal, having admitted the highest number of students through bribes and having some of the highest profile cases. In the wake of the scandal in March 2019, USC announced a variety of reforms related to increased oversight in the athletic admissions department and promptly fired those directly involved, including former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and former head water polo coach Jovan Vavic.
Since “Operation Varsity Blues,” USC parents involved in the scheme have faced a range of prison sentences. In late 2019, Devin Sloane, a USC parent who paid $250,000 for his son to be admitted has a fake water polo recruit, was sentenced to four months, and Jeffrey Bizzack, another USC parent who paid $250,000 for his son to be designated as a volleyball recruit, was sentenced to two months.
Loughlin is expected to be sentenced Friday.

Former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden’s decision to select Sen. Kamala Harris, former prosecutor and attorney general of California, as his running mate in the 2020 election during a time of heightened concerns about police brutality is an insensitive action that warrants questioning from voters.
For years now, the United States has been grappling with the handling of police brutality. Certainly, this issue is nothing new, but the discussion surrounding it was reignited by the killing of George Floyd at the hand of three police officers in May, a tragedy that sent the country into nationwide riots and protests. This situation makes the Democratic Party’s decision to nominate two politicians who, in several stages of their political careers, were both deeply involved in the advent and continuation of the prison industrial complex, even more confusing. 
The irony of a party standing behind Black Lives Matter while simultaneously pushing its base to vote for Biden, who was involved in every major crime bill from 1976 to 1994, and Harris, who denied transgender prisoners the right to gender confirmation surgery, is palpable. Biden and Harris’ decisive roles in mass incarceration — and the ways these policies negatively and disproportionately affected Black people as a result —  must not be overlooked.
This piece is by no means meant to singularly critique Harris for her actions. Rather, it is meant to urge readers to avoid idealizing politicians — it is possible to exercise fervent support for a party while also acknowledging the dimensions and nuances, both good and bad, that define its leaders. 
Voting is not a marriage to any one political candidate; it is a form of transportation alongside them. Voters may find that their values do not perfectly align with a candidate’s platform, but they should still do what they can to stand on the right side of history. It is entirely possible for voters to commit to support Biden and Harris in the presidential election while simultaneously acknowledging their past actions and the anachronistic nature of the Democratic ticket.
One of the most controversial aspects of Harris’ political past that has come to the forefront since rumors of her nomination was her involvement in California’s movement to reduce truancy, which was a massive part of Harris’ platform during her time as both a San Francisco district attorney and as the Attorney General of California. 
In theory, being tough about having as few children be truant as possible sounds perfectly fine, but it was the application of the protocol that created issues for Harris. Her tough truancy policy, which involved threatening the parents of students who skipped school with criminal charges, led to her sponsorship of SB 1317, a 2010 state law that assigned misdemeanors to parents of students that missed 10% of school days without valid excuses. 
Although, according to Harris, the law was not meant to criminalize parents, as the law offered parents the opportunity to avoid jail time if they improved the attendance rate of their children, several parents were arrested for their children’s truancy rates. Among them was Cheree Peoples, a mother whose child’s frequent visits to the hospital for sickle cell anemia treatment led to the Buena Park Police Department arresting her. Moreover, Harris has previously referred to herself as both a “top cop” and “progressive prosecutor,” titles that seem almost sickening when considered in the context of the current social climate.
To their credit, Biden and Harris have released statements in the past supporting Black Lives Matter, with Biden calling the recent protests a “wake-up call” on June 2 and Harris tweeting that Black Lives Matter was not “just a moment, but a movement” on June 11 in response to the protest in West Hollywood just a day earlier. That being said, when a quick Google search can find Biden’s previous quote concerning incarceration, “It doesn’t matter whether or not they’re the victims of society … They must be taken off the street,” in 1993 and Harris’s involvement in over 1,900 marijuana convictions during her time as a district attorney, these words are empty platitudes. 
These were not isolated incidents either; for both Biden and Harris, their involvement in furthering the prison industrial complex were years-long commitments that served as the building blocks for their respective political careers. For them to then launch a presidential ticket for a party whose primary voting base finds itselfconcerned about the role of police across America is insulting.
Encouraging fellow Generation Z students to profess their support for these candidates without first doing the necessary research to understand their rise to prominence is similar to blindly encouraging one another to repost political informational Instagram posts without first stopping to do research on these graphics. It may be done with the right intent and heart in mind, but it is far less valuable without a proper analysis of the situation and study of what the Biden-Harris ticket really means if elected. No candidate or party can ever truly be perfect, and it’s important to both stand on the right side of history while also openly acknowledging a candidate’s shortcomings and striving to hold them accountable.
