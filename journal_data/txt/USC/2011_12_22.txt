Plenty of adjectives describe USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley.
Following a season in which he threw for 3,528 yards, along with 39 touchdown passes, the third-year signal caller has received his fair share of praise over the last month.

But on Thursday, as Barkley announced he would return to school for his senior season – forgoing the chance to declare for the NFL draft, USC coach Lane Kiffin, perhaps, took it a step further.
“I believe he is the perfect Trojan: Matty Trojan,” Kiffin said. “The perfect example of a student-athlete.”
On the surface, it is easy to dub Kiffin’s “perfect” label merely a hyperbole. After all, USC boasts six Heisman Trophy winners and a litany of All-Americans and NFL draft picks. It’s a rather impressive list. Within the last nine years, three players alone have won the Heisman. And it’s especially lofty praise for Barkley, who has yet to deliver any postseason hardware to the Heritage Hall lobby – outside of an Emerald Bowl trophy in 2009.
Despite a résumé that as of now doesn’t measure up to past signal callers such as Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer, it’s more than a fair assertion.
Barkley had the chance to turn pro. It would have been a safe choice. He would have likely been a first-round pick, possibly even a top-10 selection. He would’ve inked a multi-million dollar contract, too. But come September 2012, he’ll be back in the cardinal and gold, carrying that trademarked Southern California smile.
“I know in my heart I have not finished my journey as a Trojan football player,” Barkley said Thursday.
The signal caller’s return likely means USC will open the season in the top-five with the chance of earning what would be the program’s 12th national championship. The Trojans will have 19 starters back after finishing the year 10-2 and ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press top-25 poll.
Next season could very well cement a legacy for Barkley that would be nearly impossible to match. Remember, 18 months earlier, he stood in that same Heritage Hall lobby as a wide-eyed 19-year-old sophomore after USC had received word of NCAA-levied sanctions – including a two-year postseason ban. Carrying the weight of a program, he was poised, answering questions with a touch of maturity not seen in many his age.
Barkley committed to USC in January 2008, as the Trojans were coming off the heels of back-to-back Rose Bowl victories under then-coach Pete Carroll.
But Carroll left during Barkley’s sophomore season, the Trojans were put on probation and, well, you know the rest of story.
Being dubbed the “perfect Trojan” is a lofty label. But it underscores a certain point: No player will be more meaningful for USC fans than Barkley.
And, yes, it’s because of the sanctions.
The Committee on Infractions punished USC after one player — Reggie Bush — accepted thousands of dollars worth of extra benefits in 2004 and 2005.
But Barkley stuck with USC despite the circumstances, and though it might have been in his best interest to do as much, it’s important nonetheless.
He has been the face of the program amid its most trying days. He has been calm, collected.
Now, he has the chance to finish his college career on a high note.
“This 2012 team has some serious unfinished business to attend to and I plan to play a part in it,” Barkley said about the Trojans’ prospects for next season.
There are a number of things that must play out over the course of the next 12 months, sure, but Kiffin’s bold declaration isn’t all that far off.
If Barkley wins the Heisman and the Trojans win the national championship game next year, I think he would go down as the greatest Trojan of them all just because of how much adversity he and the Trojans have faced. I really hope that happens because it would be a great story. 75 Trojans with the world against them, with two #7s who opted to pass up millions of dollars to lead them, and coming out on top.

Trojan football fans had to anxiously wait until Matt Barkley’s press conference at 1 p.m. on Thursday to learn that the junior quarterback would return for his senior season, forgoing the opportunity to enter the NFL draft.
USC football coach Lane Kiffin discovered Barkley’s fate a day earlier, but only after enduring a painfully long wait himself.
Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
At 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Kiffin received a call from Barkley asking that Kiffin and his wife, Layla, drive to Newport Beach to meet with Barkley’s family in their home that evening.
“[Barkley] said, ‘Coach can you come down. I am having information overload. There is too much stuff coming at me,’” Kiffin said. “At that point, I was trying to figure out what that really meant.”
On the drive south from USC, Kiffin tried to distract himself by listening to sports talk radio and calling recruiting prospects, but the topic of conversation inevitably returned to Barkley’s forthcoming decision.
“I kept asking my wife what she thought, going over the things that [Barkley] had told me,” Kiffin said.
When Kiffin pulled up to Barkley’s house, he noticed that there were not a lot of cars in the driveway.
“I did not think that was a good sign,” Kiffin said. “I thought his grandparents and girlfriend would be there if it was a yes. So then I thought it was not going to be a yes.”
Barkley invited Kiffin into the house, and after five minutes of small talk, took Kiffin over to the family Christmas tree, which was filled with ornaments that Barkley and his two younger siblings had made over the years.
Barkley showed Kiffin the newest ornament, which featured a picture of Barkley and Kiffin celebrating after the 42-17 victory over Colorado in which Barkley threw for a school-record six touchdowns.
Kiffin analyzed the ornament and soon realized that on the back were the words “One more year. To memories next year.”
“I was very relieved,” Kiffin said. “My plays look a lot better when he is throwing the ball.”
Barkley enjoyed seeing Kiffin’s reaction.
“Lane was shocked and surprised,” Barkley said. “Layla even started crying she was so happy.”
Barkley’s public announcement came a day after junior safety T.J. McDonald declared that he would remain at USC for the 2012 season. Wide receivers Robert Woods and Marqise Lee return after catching 15 and 11 touchdowns, respectively, last season.
“With the talent coming back, we can do something special,” Barkley predicted.
Dear Marr,
I admire your talents and strengths, I congratulate you on your  decision to remain at U.S.C.  and complete your education and compete on the Trojan Football team one more year.Next year will be a fantastic year for you and the team under coach kiffin.
May God Bless you and your family.

Junior quarterback Matt Barkley will stay at USC for his senior season, forgoing the 2012 NFL draft. Barkley was the last of the four draft eligible juniors to announce his decision and just one day after junior safety T.J. McDonald
Barkley made his announcement Thursday at Heritage Hall in front of a crowd of media and fans. Barkley took to the podium promptly at 1 p.m.

The quarterback discussed the lengthy process involved in the decision making process. The three-year starter came to his conclusion after meetings with USC coach Lane Kiffin, Athletic Director Pat Haden and those associated with the NFL, including agents.
“It is my dream to play quarterback in the NFL and I intend to make that dream a reality,” Barkley said. “But I know in my heart I have not yet finished my journey as a Trojan football player.”
Barkley was one of the players who stayed despite the sanctions the NCAA handed down to USC two years ago.
“Our USC football team has been through some tough times and we have persevered,” Barkley said. “The 2012 team has some serious unfinished business to attend to and I intend to play a part of it.”
Immediately following his announcement, the crowd at Heritage Hall cheered as the Trojan Marching Band played. Barkley said he values his education at USC and is not postponing his dreams to play football at the professional level because of his desire to have another year as a college student.
Barkley credits his decision to stay to the inspiration from his fellow teammates. “I am staying because I want to finish what I started — finish alongside the most dedicated and courageous teammates I could ever have known for a few short years,” he said. “I dedicated myself fully to achieving all that I can as a USC football player.”

Begging to differ with the nonetheless congratulatory cheesemonger above, our errant colleague shall lead a charge girded in the same wisdom that consoles true martyrs.  And yet as some students of deferred gratification will note, this homage to the Marketing Concept (certainly fulfilling the needs of Trojans and fans) is well worth the risks, in terms of generating greater dividends, well past a career’s typical lifecycle.
A+!!!

Attention Mr. Alumnus With Foresight (above).  The correct usage of our mother tongue is “You should’ve gone pro” Not went pro.  Perhaps you should have also stayed in school a little longer.
I earned an “A” in WRIT 340 FYI. I like to speak in a patois because it conveys a down-to-earth demeanor about me. I’m not prissy like you. 
…And perhaps, you should have wrote “[t]he correct usage of our mother tongue is ‘[y]ou should’ve gone pro,’ not ‘went pro.’ ” 
Whatevers, and it’s obvious you = “David” and “El Quixotian”
We frat guys support you Matt!   We would stay too!
Matt, I commend you, your achievements, and your nobel gesture…but martyrs are fools. You’re losing chedda homie. You could be like Peyton Manning or Mark Sanchez and make 8 digit annual income. You should’ve went pro…Heismanns are meaningless. 
But good luck, I hope you and next year’s talent will get SC to a championship.
Matt is an outstanding example of the student in student-athlete.  His powerful words and mature presence give lie to the constant misrepresentation ofU SC student-athletes.  Forsaking a Stanford education is apparently easier than leaving Troy!  Right on Matt and Fight On for old SC!
