Students from different religious groups came together to share prayers of healing for the upcoming presidential election during a nonpartisan event held in the USC Caruso Catholic Center courtyard on Monday evening.
The event was sponsored by the USC Interfaith Council and the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, The Church of Latter Day Saints Student Association, USC Muslim Student Union, Crusaders for Christ, Secular Student Fellowship, USC Hillel, Hindu Student Organization and the Sikh Student Association each selected a representative to give a prayer. 
The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding’s Walter Ruby opened the prayer session. His organization is a New York-based nonprofit that brings together peoples of all faiths, specifically Jews and Muslims. 
“We are urging students to come together and stand up for each other in the face of bigotry and hatred that has come up in the elections,” Ruby said. “We’re going to be here for each other no matter what happens tomorrow.”
Mary Cate Hickman, the president of the USC Interfaith Council and staff writer for the Daily Trojan, said that because USC has the most religious organizations in the nation, she wanted to give everyone the opportunity to express their faith.
“I didn’t want it to be an interfaith event with just Christians because that’s so not representative of our campus,” Hickman said. “I was very vigilant in making sure that they were all here.” 
Hannah Maluyao, from the non-denominational Crusaders for Christ group, prayed there would be honesty in the election process and the right person would become president.
“Would you help us to uphold justice, would you stand for those who are oppressed and would you help us to ensure that we treat one another fairly,” Maluyao said in prayer.
Some prayers advocated for everyone to overcome hatred and bigotry, not only in the US election, but around the globe. Nimarta Singh and Sehej Singh from the Sikh Student Association translated a prayer into English, which said “when my lord accepted my prayer, the entire world became stress free and full of peace and love.”
Mohamed el Farra, representing the Muslim Student Union, chose a prayer that he felt appropriately addressed the decision that America faces today. He recited the prayer in Arabic before translating it into English. 
“Relent towards us, thou art the relenting and the merciful, and make us grateful for thy blessing and make us praise it while accepting it and give it to us in full,” el Farra said.
Toward the middle of the event, those in attendance held a brief moment of silence and lit candles to reflect in their own prayers and thoughts.
To bring together people of all walks of life, the Interfaith Council hosted a representative from the Secular Student Fellowship. While Dylan McKeithe, a senior majoring in physics and a secular humanist, did not pray, he gave a brief speech that touched on overall human nature and how it relates to the election.
“Humans, though they may strive to be, are not rational beings and we are rationalizing beings,” McKeithe said. “We make emotional decisions and come out with a rationale that supports it afterward.”
Paulina Nuñez, a freshman majoring in sociology, attended the prayer because she realized that the correct choice of president can only be made by a united front.
“It should be important to everyone to get together and make sure that the person that we chose tomorrow is someone that will bring good not only to our personal life, but everyone in general,” Nuñez said.
Each prayer fit into the overall message of healing, forgiving and letting the singular God as well as multiple gods determine the outcome of the election.

Vice Provost of Academic Operations Mark Todd and President of Student Veterans Association Joshua Lynch spoke about the struggles veterans face and the resources available to veterans at the Veterans Appreciation Week kickoff event in Sample Hall on Monday evening.
Regina Nordahl, associate dean of USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, has hosted and organized Veteran Appreciation Week for two years in a row and hopes to establish it in coming years.
“Its an appreciation and an awareness. It’s a way for students, faculty and staff to understand who our veterans are and what their experiences have been and how their experiences contribute to who we are as a University,” Nordahl said. “The more we know about one another, it’s a way to expand our knowledge and let people understand they have more in common than they think. VA week allows us to be forward-thinking and look at our similarities, not our differences.“
Some of the highlights of Veterans Appreciation Week will include a career fair, a letter signing, boot camp workout and veteran luncheon taking place during the week. 
Josh Lynch served in the Army National Guard from 2008-2014. He was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and now strives to ease veterans’ transitions and spread awareness about the veteran population on campus as President of the Student Veterans Association. 
“There’s this stereotype that veterans are crazy [and] you can’t work with them. That’s all wrong,” Lynch said. “VA week will put us on the map and spread awareness that we do exist.”
Todd spoke about the veteran community and USC’s immensely diverse student body.  USC has over 600 veterans enroll as students each semester, and that number is growing. Todd said that much of the veteran population at USC are transfers from community college, and USC’s Veteran Resource Center is set up to ease that transition. 
“We are just tremendously proud of our veterans and instead of just celebrating Veterans Day, we want to express our gratitude to them by putting on a whole week of events,” Todd said. “The university admits over 800 community college transfers and one in every six come from community college compared to our competitors — one in 1,000. So we greatly value the diversity that community college brings and a lot of our veterans come in through that route.” 
Jennifer Perdomo serves as coordinator for the Veteran Resource Center, and oversees many of the support systems and resources available to veterans on campus. She said that the resources offered by the center help veterans who may otherwise struggle to keep up with their classes.
“We may have students who may not want to be known as a veteran and that’s okay but we have that veteran space available where they can lounge or study and have safe space like any of the other culture centers on campus,” Perdomo said.

California Attorney General and U.S. Senatorial candidate Kamala Harris spoke at the “Her Story: Kamala Harris” event that took place at Ronald Tutor Campus Center Monday evening. The event was hosted by Womenspeak USC, USC College Democrats and the USC Political Student Assembly.
Harris discussed the importance of voting and youth leadership, as well as the issues on her platform, such as immigration reform, gun control and criminal justice reform. 
“Right now, whether you realize it or not, your leadership is some of the most important leadership we have in this country, which is the leadership that has always come from students,” Harris said at the beginning of her speech. “Every great movement has had, as a key component, the leadership of students.” 
The event was co-sponsored by the Black Student Assembly, the Women’s Student Assembly, the Latina/o Student Assembly, the Asian Pacific American Student Services and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly. 
Nick Fiorello, the USC College Democrats political director, said the event came together by collaborating with groups across campus that represent different communities and interests. 
“We are so thrilled to have this opportunity. We are so grateful the campaign was able to make this happen the day before the election,” Fiorello said. 
Fiorello said the group is hopeful Harris will win tomorrow. 
“We are so proud to have a progressive champion like Kamala Harris here tonight,” Fiorello said. “We are so excited to see the results tomorrow. We are confident and hopeful that she’ll have a very strong win tomorrow, and we will have a tremendous advocate and candidate for Californians in the Senate tomorrow.”
Madelynn Taras, the assistant director of the Political Student Assembly, said the main reason for bringing Harris to campus was to encourage students to vote right before the election. 
“We wanted to bring Kamala here to remind everyone that tomorrow is the big day, to keep posted on the news, and to make sure to go and vote, whether that means physically going to a station or mailing in,” Taras said. 
Taras, a junior majoring in international relations, said the groups who organized the event tried their best to make sure as many campus leaders as possible could be a part of bringing Harris to campus.
“Whether you’re a Democrat or Republican or voting for Kamala or not, she’s a really good inspiration and a really great example of a woman who has probably been told ‘no’ many times and who’s kept persevering throughout her life to become our possible next senator,” Taras said. “She’s just breaking numerous glass ceilings, and it’s really inspiring to have seen her at USC.”
Taras added that due to the large number of people in attendance, some students had to be turned away at the door. For Taras, this was a testament to the passion of those who would make time on a Monday evening to meet Harris. On the other hand, she wished that everyone was able to participate in the event.
“When you do political events, there’s always the thought in the back of your mind that there could be some backlash, some people that don’t agree, whether or not you agree with her policies,” Taras said. “The respect that people had for her tonight was really inspiring.” 
Michela Boarnet, a freshman majoring in public policy, commented on the event.
“It was a slow start, but once she got up on there and started speaking, I was really impressed by everything she had to say and her composure when she was on stage,” Boarnet said. “She talked about a lot of great points that are viable issues in our generation.”
For Boarnet, student engagement in political events is necessary for the future of society. 
“I think it’s really great that the organizations who put on this event were able to get her to come speak for us, especially with this upcoming election,” Boarnet said. “We’re really the ones who are affected most by it, so having these political leaders on campus to serve as catalyst for voting and becoming more politically involved is really a good thing.”

This Saturday, ESPN College Gameday will be at the USC-Washington game in Seattle. I’ve grown up a USC fan, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve loved getting to watch Gameday and have always wanted to go to a show when they were at USC. I’ve always been entertained by the signs and the antics that come with the show. 
Now in my junior year, one of my main wishes as a student has been to have Gameday on campus. I still haven’t had the chance. 
I almost had the chance in 2013 when Gameday was at Stanford when USC was visiting Palo Alto. Ironically enough, my parents were at the game while I was in the mountains on a church retreat. I had an amazing time while on retreat, but getting the videos of the Trojan victory and fans storming the field from current students, friends and USC alum sent to me made it all bittersweet. 
In 2014, I lived vicariously through my best friend Nicolette, a Baylor fan, when Gameday stopped in Waco, Texas for the Kansas State-Baylor game. It was really cool to hear about how she spent the night on a grass field surrounded by her fellow Bears fans making posters, getting free gear and bonding together as a fan base. She was even lucky enough to get her sign on the broadcast. It was everything I had wanted to experience, but I looked forward to the possibility of Gameday being at USC either of the next three seasons. 
There were rumors and speculations of Gameday coming to USC during my sophomore season, but nothing panned out. I was halfway through my time at USC, but undeterred from the chances of it actually happening. 
On Sunday morning, while I was at home, my dad came in my room to tell me, “Guess where Gameday is going on Saturday?” Frankly, I didn’t want to believe it. I even hesitated to say the Washington game because it meant that Gameday was going to be at a USC game and I was not. 
Of course, Gameday would be at Washington. It stung even more because I was supposed to be in Seattle for the game. Not only would I get to work the game on the field, I was also going to get to visit friends from home that I hadn’t seen in awhile. On top of all of that, I would get to participate in the excitement that is College Gameday. But, of course, because of some commitments for a class project, I am not able to go up to Seattle for the game. It’s a bummer for a number of reasons, because I also love Seattle, but it’s a huge bummer because I’m missing out on the opportunity to participate in Gameday.
With only one home game left against 3-6 Notre Dame, I can almost certainly say that College Gameday will not be making the trek to L.A. to cover the game. 
Another USC football season through, another season without Gameday on USC’s campus. Just as I have over the last two seasons, I’ll survive by looking forward to the possibility that Gameday will make an appearance. Looking forward, there’s a huge part of me hoping that Gameday will come in September when the Texas Longhorns make their way to the Coliseum. While the Trojans have a 4-1 all-time record against the Longhorns, every Trojans fan knows about the poor taste left behind by the 2005 National Championship Game — the last time the Trojans and Longhorns faced off. 
Even though this season isn’t done yet, I’ll be looking forward to next season and Sept. 16 when there’s a real chance that College Gameday could once again be on our campus.

Sophomore running back Ronald Jones II may have stole the show against Oregon, rampaging his way to a program-record four touchdowns, but Saturday night also saw the arrival of sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett. The slot receiver found himself thrust into a bigger role after redshirt junior Steven Mitchell Jr. suffered a season-ending injury, and Burnett was up for the challenge. He tied his career high with seven catches for 87 yards and found the end zone in the Trojans’ 45-20 win over the Ducks.
“It was time for other guys to step up,” redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold said. “They did, and they did a great job.”
Darnold has looked for Burnett on several key plays since seizing the starting role, and the pair’s connection extends off the gridiron.
“Me and Deontay have great chemistry,” Darnold said. “We play basketball together in the offseason all the time.” 
Burnett agreed that he and Darnold have synergy on the field. 
“We have a good connection. We’re just out there making plays for each other,” he said. “Hats off to Sam: He’s a tremendous talent.” 
Burnett had made noise before, racking up 93 yards on seven receptions against Arizona State in October. He had also nabbed a touchdown on his only catch of the game for the past two weeks. Saturday was the first time Burnett managed to combine scoring with high yardage.
“I just always had to be ready,” Burnett said. “It’s all coming at me now, and I just have to lock in and take every opportunity that comes my way.”
He certainly rose to the occasion on Saturday. Burnett’s longest reception of the day came in the second quarter, when he took the ball into Oregon territory on a 29-yard reception.
But Burnett’s biggest highlight of the game came in the two-minute drill. He accounted for 42 of 45 yards in the Trojans’ final touchdown of the first half. After grabbing a Darnold bullet for 17 yards to convert a third-and-long, Burnett reeled in two more receptions for 23 yards and scored a two-yard touchdown on his fourth reception of the drive.
“All of our guys did a great job running their routes and expecting the ball every single play,” Darnold said. “That’s been the huge key so far this season. Everyone is taking advantage of their opportunities.”
Burnett said it was “surreal” taking the field in Cardinal and Gold every week, and he now hopes to settle into his bigger role over the coming weeks.
“I’m comfortable,” he said. “I just have to correct some mistakes that I’ve been making with some film.”
A tough follow-up assignment awaits, however, as the Trojans travel to Seattle next weekend to face No. 4 Washington. But Burnett is raring to go toe-to-toe against the undefeated Huskies.
“They’re a good defense, but we’re a good offense,” he said. “The best will come out next week so I can’t wait, and I know my teammates can’t wait, either.”
Despite USC’s much-maligned slow start to the season, the Trojans are just a game out of the Pac-12 South lead and still have an outside chance of making the conference championship. A loss at Washington likely crushes that dream, but an upset could bring it that much closer to reality.
Not that Burnett needs any reminding. 
“It’s November,” he said. “We have to just go: all gas, no brakes.”

Burnett had made noise before, racking up 93 yards on seven receptions against Arizona State in October. He had also nabbed a touchdown on his only catch of the game for the past two weeks. Saturday was the first time Burnett managed to combine scoring with high yardage.
“I just always had to be ready,” Burnett said. “It’s all coming at me now, and I just have to lock in and take every opportunity that comes my way.”
He certainly rose to the occasion on Saturday. Burnett’s longest reception of the day came in the second quarter, when he took the ball into Oregon territory on a 29-yard reception.
But Burnett’s biggest highlight of the game came in the two-minute drill. He accounted for 42 of 45 yards in the Trojans’ final touchdown of the first half. After grabbing a Darnold bullet for 17 yards to convert a third-and-long, Burnett reeled in two more receptions for 23 yards and scored a two-yard touchdown on his fourth reception of the drive.
“All of our guys did a great job running their routes and expecting the ball every single play,” Darnold said. “That’s been the huge key so far this season. Everyone is taking advantage of their opportunities.”
Burnett said it was “surreal” taking the field in Cardinal and Gold every week, and he now hopes to settle into his bigger role over the coming weeks.
“I’m comfortable,” he said. “I just have to correct some mistakes that I’ve been making with some film.”
A tough follow-up assignment awaits, however, as the Trojans travel to Seattle next weekend to face No. 4 Washington. But Burnett is raring to go toe-to-toe against the undefeated Huskies.
“They’re a good defense, but we’re a good offense,” he said. “The best will come out next week so I can’t wait, and I know my teammates can’t wait, either.”
Despite USC’s much-maligned slow start to the season, the Trojans are just a game out of the Pac-12 South lead and still have an outside chance of making the conference championship. A loss at Washington likely crushes that dream, but an upset could bring it that much closer to reality.
Not that Burnett needs any reminding. 
“It’s November,” he said. “We have to just go: all gas, no brakes.”

It is a lazy Sunday afternoon, and Jordan McLaughlin is alone on the practice courts of the Galen Center. Travis Scott’s latest album pumps through the speakers as McLaughlin launches jumper after jumper. The only interruption of the smooth sounds of the swish of the net, the shooting machine returning the ball with a “pop” back into his hands is the rare clank of a shot off the rim.
He’s been at it for quite some time. The number on the machine reads 400 shots taken — and counting.
“Let me know when you want to talk,” he said, “because I’ll be here awhile.”
It may be an off day for the team — they had practiced on Friday and had a scrimmage on Saturday — but not for McLaughlin, the junior point guard and de facto leader of the men’s basketball team as it looks to build upon its first appearance in the NCAA tournament in five years. The season begins on Friday with a home game against Montana.
If there was any doubt last season, this is Jordan McLaughlin’s team now, for better or for worse. Following a 21-win campaign that generated genuine excitement about USC basketball for the first time since DeMar DeRozan roamed the Galen Center floor, the Trojans went into the offseason on a downbeat with two key starters departing.
Gone is Julian Jacobs, the athletic, defensive stalwart who shared a leadership role with McLaughlin last season. Gone is Nikola Jovanovic, the skilled 6-foot-11 power forward who could score from inside and outside. Both declared for the NBA draft as juniors, surprising McLaughlin by forgoing their final year of college eligibility. Now, it’s on McLaughlin to be the leader.
Jordan McLaughlin is ready to take the Trojans to new heights – Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
“It puts a lot of pressure on me,” McLaughlin said. “But that’s one of the reasons I came here. With them departing, it was saddening, but you’ve got to move on. I’ve got to be more vocal either on or off the court, and make sure I’m leading the young guys and everybody else.”
Pressure is something McLaughlin has grown accustomed to, considering USC more or less built its program around him.
Born in Pasadena, McLaughlin came from an athletic family and played basketball, baseball and football as a kid. One theme was common among the sports — as a point guard in basketball, a pitcher in baseball and a quarterback in football, he always had the ball in his hands.
But choosing basketball was an easy decision. He was a huge Michael Jordan fan growing up, and would try to imitate the Bulls’ legend in the movie Space Jam. 
“My parents would call me from the kitchen to the living room. They’d yell my name — ‘Jordan McLaughlin’ — as a little kid, and I’d try to make a layup,” he said.
McLaughlin also liked the fast pace of basketball. So up the ranks he went, through recreational league, middle school, high school and travel teams. He made the varsity team as a freshman at local prep basketball powerhouse Etiwanda High School, and was a four-star recruit by his senior season (a mixtape of McLaughlin’s senior season featuring the point guard’s shooting, dribbling and passing prowess has more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.) Big-time collegiate programs came after him hard, pinging his phone daily.
When decision-making time came, he was down to offers from four schools: Indiana, Kansas, UCLA and USC. The first three were traditional national powerhouses, the latter a fledgling program and a clear afterthought to football on campus.
But there was something about head coach Andy Enfield’s pitch that clicked with McLaughlin.
“He said I had the opportunity to come and lead the program and change it,” McLaughlin said. “USC had been struggling the past couple of years. He said I would have the opportunity to change the program around.”
McLaughlin, who had chosen basketball for its fast pace, was also enthralled with how Enfield envisioned the offense would look with McLaughlin running the point — playing fast, smart and unselfish.
“I fell in love with his style of play,” McLaughlin said. “He wants to play fast. He wants to score in the first eight seconds [of the shot clock], set a lot of ball screens, just play good team basketball.” 
And there was one more thing. Just a few days before Bill Sharman — the Boston Celtics Hall of Famer who played his college ball at USC — passed away in 2013, he agreed to have his No. 11 unretired from the Galen Center rafters for McLaughlin to wear.
During McLaughlin’s recruiting visit to USC, coaches told him that he could have the number he wore throughout high school. It signified the program’s investment in McLaughlin and the future they envisioned with him leading it.
So he jumped on board to USC, accepting the challenge to be the centerpiece of the rebuilding process as opposed to just another recruit elsewhere. 
Two years later and the ship is on course. McLaughlin’s freshman season was a struggle. Though he made the Pac-12 All-Freshman team, USC won just three conference games and lacked a veteran presence.
“We lost a lot of games down the stretch due to our inexperience,” McLaughlin said. “We didn’t have anybody to control us and teach us the ways of how to win down the stretch.”
With experience came wisdom. McLaughlin and his teammates turned the close losses into wins in his sophomore season, with the point guard leading the Trojans with eight 20-point games. The renaissance season culminated in a trip to the NCAA Tournament, but it ended in heartbreaking fashion when the Trojans blew a fourth quarter lead to Providence, allowing a wide-open game-winning layup at the buzzer.
“Everybody was feeling it in the locker room,” McLaughlin said. “There were a few tears. It was just hardening. You don’t want your season to end like that after you haven’t gotten that far in a while for USC.”
Now, expectations will be for the Trojans to make it back to March Madness — and go further. And it will be McLaughlin running the show, no longer sharing ball-handling duties with Jacobs or having the reliable Jovanovic in the post. Instead, he’ll lean on fellow junior guard Elijah Stewart in the backcourt, sophomore forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu in the frontcourt and a slew of freshmen and transfers to round out the roster.
Stewart, who played against McLaughlin in high school at Westchester, said there hasn’t been a year in which the point guard hasn’t improved.
“Every year, he comes back and his moves get crisper, his shooting gets better, his decision-making gets better,” Stewart said.  “He always adds something extra to his game. He’s just constantly evolving.”
Stewart said that as a leader, McLaughlin doesn’t talk a whole lot on the court, but his words are prudent.
“When he tells you something, he’s right most of the time,” Stewart said.
McLaughlin’s life outside basketball ranges from maintaining his large sneaker collection (he says he has between 80-85 pairs), listening to Kendrick Lamar (“His meanings behind his verses are just ridiculous”) and working on his degree in sociology. He plans on minoring in communications and wants to be a sports commentator after his career.
But first, he wants to make it to the NBA, and the next stepping-stone is a breakout junior season. McLaughlin signed onto USC with hefty expectations, as the core piece of Enfield’s first recruiting class and wearing the jersey number of a legend. Now, it’s his team, and it’s his time.
“I feel a lot of pressure,” McLaughlin said. “Life is all about pressure. The game is about pressure. If you don’t accept the pressure, there’s no point in playing. You have to live up to the hype.”
Where does he find the sources to have that many sneakers in his collection?

Too often voters see ads or talks suggesting that, if you vote on Election Day, you’re doing your duty as a citizen. The American people should strongly disagree with that sentiment. Plenty of people who vote are not necessarily good citizens, and plenty of good citizens don’t exercise their right to vote. Voting is a privilege of American citizenship; the act of voting and making your voice heard and choosing your government is not citizenship incarnate in itself. Citizenship, properly understood, is so much more than that.
So what is citizenship? American citizenship is a way of life, a “full-time job” so to speak. It affects all aspects of personal and public life, including but not limited to civic life. You have to strive to be a good citizen every day — not just Tax Day, Independence Day and Election Day. In some ways citizenship resembles what the Central Intelligence Agency’s code of ethos calls “quiet patriotism.” And most of all, it is a constant choice, like any faith. Here are a few of its aspects, as well as some ongoing questions about the broad topic.
Patriotism includes honesty about your country’s flaws. This is by no means an ode to unthinking jingoism, blind to the realities of slavery, the extermination of Native Americans, imperialism and white supremacy that have partly defined and wholly pockmarked the American heritage. But just as we ourselves are not perfect, and just as our families have their flaws, but we love them still, so loving America means acknowledging the evil in its heritage alongside the good, and the good alongside the evil. On balance, reasonable people will conclude that the American project is worth preserving and defending, if for no other reason than that it is ours. 
Citizenship is love of countrymen. In this most raucous of election seasons we’ve been dividing against each other in the most brutal of ways — we are all guilty of castigating both Trump supporters and Clinton supporters as something other than fully American. But the fact of the matter is, we’re all in this together — we’re all Americans — we have different ideas about how to steer the ship of state, but we’re on it all at once. Some kind of notion of common identity and basic acknowledgment of fellowship is necessary, especially on the part of our leaders. As soon as disagreement and distaste turns to hatred, we’re not really countrymen; that makes the task of governance that much harder. 
Citizenship is participation in our political process, and this involves much more than just pulling a lever every couple of years. It involves self-education on issues of public importance, advocacy of and for those issues, interaction with elected officials and other public servants, and even public service through holding office at any level. This is the active side of citizenship; but plenty of hacks operate in this world without being good citizens. The temperamental qualities must be present, too.
Citizenship is service to country above all things. In my view, the highest acts of citizenship are the hard acts of public service- the hard and controversial work of legislators and executives, for one, but also the more mundane work of bureaucrats, and especially the life-risking work of police and military service-members. It’s important to note that this work is different than political participation, which focuses on determining the direction society should take and is in some ways self-interested. Public service, on the other hand, does not allow the military officer or police officer or bureaucrat the right to question whether or not the public made the right choice — they obey out of duty and fidelity to a cause higher than self and higher than one’s own conscience. And sometimes they die doing it. This is citizenship expressed purely, an act of love, belonging and sacrifice that cannot be mimicked by mere voting.
Good citizenship, like all things worthwhile, is hard to attain and harder to maintain, and must above all be practiced in one’s own conscience, one’s own life and in the arena of public life. And not all of us will reach it. But it’s something whose cultivation should be encouraged in all Americans — not denigrated as the last cloak of racism, nor reduced to the simple act of voter participation. It is fidelity to a cause higher than self and higher than one’s own conscience. And sometimes they die doing. This is citizenship expressed purely, an act of love, belonging and sacrifice that cannot be mimicked by mere voting.

The election on Tuesday will be decided based on the combined effects of innumerable factors. One factor in particular, however, is extremely important for Democrats and Republicans alike: the voting patterns of the working class, especially working class whites. Over 60 percent of workers without a bachelor’s degree are white. This group made up approximately 44 percent of the electorate in 2012. Their voting power cannot be overlooked this election.
Working class whites cannot fairly be lumped into one political camp. Their views and backgrounds are highly diverse. However, members of this group do exhibit certain trends in their political leanings. It has become evident during this election cycle that more working class whites have considered Donald Trump’s promise to make America great again than have believed Hillary Clinton’s slogan of being stronger together. This is likely due to a problem that even Hillary Clinton acknowledged in an interview with The New Yorker: “We are the party of working people, but we haven’t done a good enough job… we haven’t had a coherent, compelling economic case.” The white working class has fallen prey in recent years to ills like poverty and debt, unsustainably large families, drug addiction and general malaise. Many face declining job prospects as employers either leave their home regions or the country altogether. They largely feel forgotten in a political climate that, it seems to many of them, is focused on problems that do not relate to their concerns. Polls show that working class whites are some of the most pessimistic and alienated people in the United States.
And here is the kicker: The white working class largely blames the federal government for these woes. Approximately 62 percent of working class whites believe that the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for their economic troubles. Sixty-six percent of the white working class believe that the federal government doesn’t do enough to help people like them. A career politician like Hillary Clinton is simply not as attractive to them as she once might have been. This is where Donald Trump’s cavalier approach to politics comes into play.
It should come as no surprise that Trump is more appealing to working class whites and that Clinton is more appealing to college-educated whites. Trump’s successes in the Republican primaries were driven in large part by his popularity among working class whites, a popularity that his myriad opponents seemingly could not compete with. About 50 percent of Republican working class whites favored Trump in the primaries. That number has only expanded since Trump won the Republican nomination, and even a substantial number of working class white Democrats have been enticed by Trump. Twenty-two percent of working class white Democrats claim that they would consider voting for Trump. Donald Trump’s presidency is unique in Washington politics for many reasons, but he has managed to do what few other political candidates have successfully done in recent years: tune into the plight of a substantial group of voters that other politicians have overlooked.
Despite making up a decreasing percentage of the national electorate, the white working class will continue to be a considerable asset for whoever is able to garner their trust. In this election, it was Trump. In future elections, we should all hope that it is someone with competency and tact.

This country was founded as a democratic republic so that the citizens could have a say in their nation’s actions and leaders. Yet many are stating their disapproval of the system in a much more public way,  through a harmful tactic known as protest voting.
 Protest voting occurs when voters consciously decide to vote outside of traditional party lines. This means that instead of voting for either Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in this election, voters take a third stance by voting outside of major party lines. Many of these protest ballots are a result of dissatisfaction with party politics, especially if voters feel like they have been wronged by America’s political system. This often substantiates the existence of third-party candidates. Prominent third-party candidates in this election are Libertarian candidate Gov. Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Both of these politicians have garnered considerable clout in this election because of the polarizing nature of the major party candidates are.  Despite their increasing popularity, third-party candidates (or blank ballots) do not help our country in any way.
 Protest voting is harmful to the democratic process in a number of ways. Its most obvious impact is that it takes away votes from the major party candidates. While those who vote third-party are aiming to reduce the number of votes for one of the candidates, they also throw away their support for the other candidate. One of the most famous examples of the effect of third-party voting is Ralph Nader’s role in the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Though Nader won maybe 3 percent of the popular vote, he was the deciding factor in the close competition. Another classic example of the third party failing is the 1992 election, where President George H.W. Bush was running for a second term against Democratic candidate Bill Clinton and Independent candidate Ross Perot. Though Perot was reportedly leading in many states, he did not get a single electoral vote. This is because he was merely a distraction; his votes were so spread out across the United States that he took away from the votes for either Bush or Clinton without earning himself a true stake in the race. This is likely what will happen with the third-party candidates in the 2016 presidential election, especially because there are multiple. The Washington Post says it best: “By withholding a vote from whoever [voters] perceive as the lesser of two evils,” they are practically voting for the candidate they are trying to avoid.
 Moreover, the United States is not set up to support third-party candidates. The electoral system guarantees this in its winner-takes-all philosophy. Most of the states are drawn this way, and after everyone votes, the candidate with the most votes gets all of the electoral votes. Third-party candidates will never achieve this. They cannot accumulate the minimum number of votes to ensure an electoral win. Many of the candidates and parties are unqualified, and no one has ever won a presidential election outside of the Democrats and Republicans. For example, the Green Party, the party Stein is representing, has never had a single representative in Congress, meaning it has never won an election. Former President Theodore Roosevelt ran for the position again as an outsider, against the man he chose to succeed him, and his campaign under the Progressive Party drove him to second place — ultimately losing the election. This is the closest America has ever come to nominating a third-party president, and he only got that far because he had already served as commander-in-chief before as a major party candidate.
Protest voting ends up doing more harm than good. By not voting completely for a major party, the voter trying to protest the system or the candidates creates a system where votes count for more than they should — directly going against what our founding fathers created with an electoral system. Voting for a major party candidate will, in fact, create a more cohesive election and, with any luck, a more cohesive race in four years.

“I’m just not going to vote; it doesn’t even matter anyways.” It’s a refrain commonly recited, particularly by young people, in the midst of an extremely negative election cycle that made many disillusioned with politics after a year and half of a particularly nasty presidential campaign. However, the decision to shun voting even when politics gets tough is the wrong response. As President Barack Obama said, “Don’t boo, vote.” 
First of all, voting extends far beyond choosing a president — even though it doesn’t always feel that way. It ranges from electing individuals to a vast array of positions, such as mayor, councilman or school board member, to actually enacting legislation through propositions. Someone’s vote for a local supervisor or proposal will arguably have a greater impact in shaping that individual’s community and daily experience compared to their choice for president. No, voting for a mayor is not as exciting as voting for a president — but its importance should not be underestimated. 
Voting sometimes seems unimportant because it can feel like a meager contribution in a large country with a large government. It can seem like an individual vote is too small to really make any sort of difference. However, the building blocks of change stem from the collective of these seemingly insignificant single votes. 
Many Americans have never had to work for the right to vote or experienced any alternative. Most haven’t experienced life without available democratic participation, and it’s easy to view such rights as a given. Perhaps it results from the failure to appreciate the privileges of democracy or the great struggle of attaining the right to vote. However, generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed for the ability to voice various concerns and opinions to the government. Failing to vote disrespects those who have given greatly for the right and continue to do so today, around the world. 
In a democracy, whoever participates in elections shapes the future of the country. Deciding not to vote creates a power vacuum whereby allowing others get to choose what the government looks like. Even if you don’t want to engage in the political process, someone else will, and you may not agree with what he or she may want. 
But, voting matters. Politics in a democratic society is draining and messy. It often fails to motivate or to unlift. Winston Churchill, the famed prime minister of Great Britain, once said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” But, the answer is not withdrawal. The political landscape of the United States will not change if left to the status quo, and the status quo will certainly not change by refusing to vote. Perhaps for some, the presidential candidates this year don’t inspire excitement in the political process. That’s fine, but voting is about much more than the personality of any one candidate. Casting a vote allows for an incremental step in a better direction, no matter how small. It’s easier to be cynical in politics, to throw in the towel and say that nothing will ever change. It’s harder and more meaningful to care and to commit to engaging in democracy even when it is negative. The response to toxic politics is not to ignore it. If anything, it is to engage more deeply in the process, and that starts with casting a vote.

As the days start to get shorter and shorter and California’s   excuse for “winter” starts to creep up, my music library changes with the season. The lyrics and the beats get a little less cheery, and the overall tone doesn’t sound as sunny as my library in April or June.
Around this time last year, I also made an effort to get around to some essential hip-hop albums I had not yet listened to. The most important of such allegedly “changed the game” as one of, if not, the most “essential” album in the history of hip-hop that brought the art back to the East Coast: Nas’ Illmatic. I had high hopes  — how could I not when everyone seemed to rave about the album? I penciled in a designated time to listen to it from start to finish in one sitting in my room after class one day.
I wasn’t impressed. That’s a controversial opinion to say the least, and I recognize how essential this album is in the history of hip-hop, but I was not as enamored with this album as everyone else seemed to be. However, looking for something to replace this feeling of guilt I had after not liking Illmatic as much as I was supposed to, I checked out an underrated classic that I had heard something about here and there. This was how I discovered my own personal Illmatic.
The Infamous, by the duo Mobb Deep, is everything the Illmatic should have been and more. When people talk about the nitty-gritty of what living life in the ghetto is actually like, this is one of two albums that I think about immediately. N.W.A was among the first to speak about the realities of being black and living in the hood, but they still had a whimsical aspect to them. It wasn’t all fun and games, but they still were able to make the occasional joke here and there and have a laugh about their situation. The Infamous has none of that.
Everything about this album is bleak, which shouldn’t be hard to guess based on the menacing album cover. The first thing I noticed, as with the majority of the albums I listen to, was the production. Most of these beats were minimal but haunting in nature. Half of the beats sounded like a funeral march, which matched the morbid rhymes that the duo lay over them.
In “Cradle to the Grave,” the beat consists of a lo-fi bass and a low distorted brass instrument that slowly climb up and down in sustained tones, accompanied by a subdued bass drum, snare and hi-hat. It’s sluggish, and the beat feels like it’s dragging at times, only being pushed forward by lyrics that explore the themes of getting into a shootout with the enemy, seeing a friend get shot in the head before your eyes and not having time to cope with their death, since the corrupt justice system will give you 25 to life.
And that’s just one song. Nearly every beat and rhyme effortlessly pushes the atmosphere of paranoia and encroaching death without feeling like it’s being over the top. Even the short skits on the album aren’t corny in any way; in fact, “The Grave Prelude” is one of the most off-putting and horrid depictions of a shootout I’ve ever heard, and it’s able to accomplish in 50 seconds what shows like The Wire do in an episode.
This is something you didn’t hear in hip-hop at the time, which was mostly focused on the glamorized gangsta life on the West Coast. The album’s most well-known and commercially successful song, “Shook Ones, Pt. II,” is essentially a death threat to anyone who is pretending to live the life of a criminal while simultaneously giving a rundown of what living a life filled with illegal activities is actually like.
If you’re a Hamilton fan and you enjoy the lyric “I’m only 19, but my mind is older,” you actually have Mobb Deep to thank for creating it, albeit in a much darker context. With debating whether or not you deserve to live and if you’re going to hell because of the things you had to do to survive, knowing that you have to choose your lyrics on this song carefully so you don’t incriminate yourself and threatening to put someone “closer to God” with your bullets, it’s easy to see how your mentality has been forced to age rapidly in relation to your physical age.
This album is one of the most essential hip-hop albums of all time for me. It’s an all-too-real reminder of what life is like in the most dangerous inner cities, and how the glorification of them is only to sell records. It’s something that’s larger than the medium it’s presented in. It’s truly a reflection of a way of living, and an experience of the disenfranchised. 
In other words, it’s the the missing link of how hip-hop went from fun and sometimes ridiculous to an intimate outlet of self-expression. On the more technical side, the rhymes are concise, saying what they need to say in a darkly poetic way, and the beats aren’t lavish, but they still manage to speak volumes: everything the Illmatic was supposed to do, but better.

The Roski School of Art and Design will showcase the works of its senior BFA students in a special opening reception on Nov. 15. Art from 14 different senior artists will be displayed as a celebration of their artistic innovation and creativity over the past four years. The exhibition theme, “My Biggest Struggle Is Choosing One Thing,” defines the experiences of each artist who will graduate this year. 
Kyle David Moreno, a senior majoring in fine arts, is among the artists who will have his works shown. An artist, designer and photographer, Moreno has been recognized by the National YoungArts Foundation and the Columbia Scholastic Press Association for his art. Hia work has  also been featured in the Huffington Post and the U.S. Capitol Building. Moreno has also participated in a collective exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art with artist Urs Fischer. 
Moreno, whose photography will be featured, believes his time at Roski has changed the way he approaches his art practice. 
“While my technical skills have steadily improved, they’ve been supported by the research, thought and conceptuality that comes into play for each piece I produce,” he said. “Classes revolving around theory and writing have been able to not only substantiate my work, but also allow me to see the connections between different pieces within my body of work and between myself and other practicing artists.”
Another artist featured in the show is senior Michael Chang, who describes himself as an “unsophisticated artist.” Inspired by his Taiwanese heritage as well as Japanese pop culture and history, Chang tells stories that would otherwise remain untold. He focuses on the social justice aspect of art — allowing people to feel empowered and heard. 
Chang’s exhibit in the show is titled Three Stages of Alienation.
“I’ve been reflecting a lot about my experiences this particular semester and wanted to make a piece that translated those thoughts visually,” Chang said. “The piece is visualizing three different moods I have had in dealing with alienation.” 
Chang co-founded USC’s Jukebox Art Collective, which shaped his interest in cultural intersections.
“Coming to USC, I was really just a body with barely any consciousness and awareness just floating along. I developed my interests in those subjects throughout different experiences I had in college, especially with the art collective Jukebox that my friend Aaron and I started in our sophomore year.” he said. “I can say that a lot of the subjects I’m interested in grew out of the various conversations we’ve had over the past three to four years.”
The BFA Senior Show acts as both a reflection of past experiences as well as an opportunity to solidify future aspirations and plans. 
“I want to keep collaborating with my friends in holding shows, making work and doing what we want, making a stamp on the city in our way.” Chang said. “Since my work has a kind of narrative structure, my friends and I are building off each other and this fluid world we’re constructing together. We’re Neo Natives.” 
The opening reception of the BFA Senior Show will be held on Nov. 15 at the Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery from 5 to 7 p.m. The exhibition will run from Nov. 7 to Nov. 29.

Based on the historical Supreme Court ruling Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage, Jeff Nichols’ new film Loving tells the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, the case’s defendants and the couple whose love for each other became a landmark victory in the fight for civil rights.
It is evident that Nichols, who both wrote and directed the film, wants to move his audience — and he largely succeeds. Loving is told sweetly and charmingly, a quiet story documenting the relationship of two Virginians whose lives gradually call the nation’s attention. But for every shared smile, quiet embrace and lingering moment of rural beauty, Loving also sacrifices true drama: the key to narrative power and the essential component to any good film.
The movie opens with Mildred (Ruth Negga) telling Richard (Joel Edgerton) that she is pregnant. From the way she averts his eyes, it is clear that the couple doesn’t know right away if this is good news or not; Mildred is black, and Richard is white, and the couple lives in a town in Virginia not far from the nation’s capital. But Richard doesn’t hesitate. He proposes to Mildred and tells her that he will build her a house in the county where both of them were raised. He moves in with Mildred and her family, and the two begin planning the life they will spend together.
Until one day when both of them are arrested. They are given an ultimatum: leave Virginia, or go to prison. Thus begins the Lovings’ journey across state lines and back again, the whole time having children, raising them, and building the life they promised each other. One day in the middle of this, Mildred writes a letter to politician Robert Kennedy about the injustice she and her husband experienced. The long fight to the Supreme Court begins.
Despite the significant and heart-wrenching magnitude of the couple’s situation, most of the conflict in the film is either expository or distant from the protagonists. Essentially, the film’s only conflict is the macro one: the fight for legitimacy that takes place in Washington, D.C. while Mildred and Richard live out their lives in Virginia. This wouldn’t be a problem, except the film does not follow the conflict where it goes. Instead, the film stays with the Lovings, and the Lovings experience little conflict in their home. 
Loving must be the first film made about a relationship in which the couple never fights. The audience also never discovers how Richard and Mildred met. What drew them to each other, fostered their attraction, made seeing each other worth more than any political force in the country? In any other love story, the audience would know. The Lovings’ grappling with the humiliating illegitimacy of their union is undoubtedly heartbreaking, but loving each other too much is not enough for character development. 
After moving back to Virginia, the Lovings raise their children in the middle of fervently green fields, constantly looking over their shoulder for people and police who want to attack them. But these antagonists, in the latter half of the film, rarely show up. And except for a singular, recognizable police officer who continues to haunt the Lovings, there truly is no tangible opposition to their relationship in this part of the film.
If Loving wants its audience to believe the victory, it must have them believe the stakes. And there is no doubt that racism is alive now, exponentially so 50 years ago. For a southern county so deeply yet subconsciously embroiled in its time, the tension goes shockingly easy on the protagonists.
It is not that the audience should have a hard time believing that racism can be more insidious than blatant, but in the South in the sixties? The largely saccharine portrait Nichols paints of race relations in this setting, combined with the drama that is kept at bay simply because it is happening in a far away place, is enough for the audience to question the intent of the film.
Loving is emotionally resonant, but ultimately disappointingly hollow. If the audience never questions the affection the couple feels toward each other and is only occasionally thrust into the midst of conflict, then what exactly is it about the film that moves people?
It is, without a doubt, the chemistry between Edgerton and Negga. The audience will have no trouble believing that Richard is head over heels for Mildred, and that she will do anything for him. But despite minor interjections into their relationship by lawyers and police and one bout in prison (the most harrowing part of the film, which also takes place in the beginning), the development of their relationship is quite conventional.
This is not to say that the film isn’t beautiful, or that the acting isn’t magnificent. Joel Edgerton is devastating as Richard Loving, a heartbreaking performance tucked neatly inside a tough, no-nonsense character. And his brilliant counterpart, Ruth Negga, plays Mildred with stunningly sweet and quiet grace. The actors are complemented by director of photography Adam Stone’s subtle close-ups, which are only occasionally disconcerting when the characters in frame are not emotionally rooted in the scene or the film.
There is no doubt that Loving is a remarkable love story. But the nature of its story does not excuse Nichols from forgoing true drama. Loving succeeds as a stunning depiction of a historic and important couple, but ultimately does not hold up as a compelling and substantial film.

Reading fiction has been my escape ever since I was young. With most of my childhood spent as an only child, my evenings were usually quiet affairs: I’d have my nose stuck in a book next to the fireplace while my parents’ nightly news on the TV provided ambient background noise. Entire universes opened up to me through the pages of paperbacks that had frayed spines from my multiple re-readings. I loved the characters as if they were living, breathing human beings. I adventured with them through jagged mountain ranges, fighting dragons and traveling to the ends of the earth by their side. I learned to empathize, to put myself in others’ shoes, and to imagine what it would be like to come from a different background with different circumstances — all by reading fiction.
Back then, it was Harry Potter, Eragon, The Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, Percy Jackson, Ender’s Game, and Sherlock Holmes. I read the occasional Judy Moody, Ramona, or Junie B. Jones, but all the fun exploits were the ones with male protagonists. Besides, my guy friends sure as heck weren’t reading any of the “girly” stuff. 
The disparity between “female” and “male” books became even more apparent as we got older. Try and recollect the first books that you can remember from your high school reading lists. You most likely analyzed them to death in class, discussing the symbolism of this or that seemingly insignificant object or instance. Think of books that left a lasting impact, ones that made you go “Ah, so this is why they call this a classic.” 
What titles come to mind? Probably The Great Gatsby, Lord of the Flies, Fahrenheit 451, The Odyssey, and Catcher in the Rye. If your school was progressive, maybe they threw in some works by Junot Díaz. 
Sadly, the only two books that I can remember from high school with female main characters are To Kill a Mockingbird and Their Eyes Were Watching God. During the most formative years of our lives, when required-reading books in our adolescence should have tackled complex and nuanced issues like sexual identity, gender, and ethnicity from diverse authors, most of the works we read were by white males who wrote of white male protagonists. It wasn’t just my high school either — reading lists nationwide tend to be disproportionate, sparsely including the occasional Brontë or Austen as token female authors. 
It wasn’t until college that I began to read more books from a female perspective. I was astounded by how much I was able to relate to the protagonists that Virginia Woolf, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and Sylvia Plath brought to life; The Bell Jar brought me to tears the first time I read it. Entering into the intimacy of the characters’ worlds, some of which were autobiographical, I sometimes laughed endlessly and other times ached with sorrow, and read so much of my mother’s strength between the lines. I realized that how I viewed life from a character’s eyes had been normalized to be through the male lens.
And then there was the world of “Women’s Fiction”, otherwise known as that separate section that I saw in Barnes & Noble stores or on Amazon. It always seemed strange to me: why, culturally, was there a type of “women’s fiction” that only females were expected to enjoy and understand, when there wasn’t really an equivalent “male fiction” genre? Also, if you blatantly gendered fiction into some sort of binary, the only readership that the authors in the “Women’s Section” could hope to pander to were women; it meant that there was little chance that men would purchase these books, at least not directly from this section in particular. Does that not severely limit the scope of audience that female writers could hope to appeal to, effectively hindering them from entering into a more influential literary sphere? And what makes a novel “female” or “male”, anyway? Is it the content — if you include more talk of things like flowers and housework and gossip, does that make your literature more “feminine”? Or is it the protagonist’s gender? It seems like it would be difficult for women to find a co-ed audience if their work is labeled “women’s fiction” at the nearby bookstore. And a double standard exists: if women don’t include the “male world” in their work, they usually lose out on mass appeal, but male authors don’t have to include “feminine” perspectives.
On the bright side, if you look at the infographics that VIDA: Women in Literary Arts have provided from 2015 and compare them to the numbers from 2010, prestigious publications like The Atlantic, New York Times, Boston Review, The New Yorker, and New Republic are making great strides of progress towards gender equity in the writing and publishing industry. A lot has changed over the past five years, and many editorial boards have committed to pushing for more equal gender representation among book reviewers and the authors of books reviewed. But the gender bias still exists in how female writers’ work is perceived in the literary world, especially by male audiences. The books that are creating the most cultural splash in literary conversations are still predominantly works written by males. Men, and all of us to a certain extent, still are not in the habit of reading women, or about women, starting from a young age. Fiction written by women is still limited by its categorization, and is read and interpreted quite differently. Reactions to the literature are sometimes imbued with implicit biases or traditional prejudices. 
Growing up with fictional male heroes, I wish that I had earlier met Esther from The Bell Jar, or Maya in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. I now know that had my parents and teachers encouraged me to read more fiction by female authors, I would have had a much more enriching and empowering childhood. And beyond just gender representation, our literary culture, habits, and high school reading lists are hopefully shifting towards a more intersectional experience, one that includes stories from diverse backgrounds and identities.

Love trumps hate – Loving tells the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, the couple whose victory against the Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage in the United States. | Photo courtesy of Focus Features
Based on the historical Supreme Court ruling Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage, Jeff Nichols’ new film Loving tells the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, the case’s defendants and the couple whose love for each other became a landmark victory in the fight for civil rights.
It is evident that Nichols, who both wrote and directed the film, wants to move his audience — and he largely succeeds. Loving is told sweetly and charmingly, a quiet story documenting the relationship of two Virginians whose lives gradually call the nation’s attention. But for every shared smile, quiet embrace and lingering moment of rural beauty, Loving also sacrifices true drama: the key to narrative power and the essential component to any good film.
The movie opens with Mildred (Ruth Negga) telling Richard (Joel Edgerton) that she is pregnant. From the way she averts his eyes, it is clear that the couple doesn’t know right away if this is good news or not; Mildred is black, and Richard is white, and the couple lives in a town in Virginia not far from the nation’s capital. But Richard doesn’t hesitate. He proposes to Mildred and tells her that he will build her a house in the county where both of them were raised. He moves in with Mildred and her family, and the two begin planning the life they will spend together.
Until one day when both of them are arrested. They are given an ultimatum: leave Virginia, or go to prison. Thus begins the Lovings’ journey across state lines and back again, the whole time having children, raising them, and building the life they promised each other. One day in the middle of this, Mildred writes a letter to politician Robert Kennedy about the injustice she and her husband experienced. The long fight to the Supreme Court begins.
Despite the significant and heart-wrenching magnitude of the couple’s situation, most of the conflict in the film is either expository or distant from the protagonists. Essentially, the film’s only conflict is the macro one: the fight for legitimacy that takes place in Washington, D.C. while Mildred and Richard live out their lives in Virginia. This wouldn’t be a problem, except the film does not follow the conflict where it goes. Instead, the film stays with the Lovings, and the Lovings experience little conflict in their home.
Loving must be the first film made about a relationship in which the couple never fights. The audience also never discovers how Richard and Mildred met. What drew them to each other, fostered their attraction, made seeing each other worth more than any political force in the country? In any other love story, the audience would know. The Lovings’ grappling with the humiliating illegitimacy of their union is undoubtedly heartbreaking, but loving each other too much is not enough for character development.
After moving back to Virginia, the Lovings raise their children in the middle of fervently green fields, constantly looking over their shoulder for people and police who want to attack them. But these antagonists, in the latter half of the film, rarely show up. And except for a singular, recognizable police officer who continues to haunt the Lovings, there truly is no tangible opposition to their relationship in this part of the film.

America is an amazing country. It’s full of leading opportunity, amazing diversity, beaches and snowy mountains, class and chaos, road trips and weekend flights. Coming here, to America, to USC, this is something I’ve learnt simply from the wonder of people I’ve met. My friends from the East Coast act, speak and think in ways that are both similar yet completely different to my friends from the West Coast, or from neither coast. 
This diversity is incredible; it’s something unique to America and — I believe — something to treasure and take pride in. However, there is more out there.

When researching and asking around as to why so many American individuals and families tended to stay within the country’s borders, I got two clear leading reasons;
I addressed number one earlier, but we can do better than that. America has a multitude of people and ideas and historic landmarks on offer — yet there are a multitude of people and ideas and historic landmarks missing. To claim or believe that one country can come close to the innate diversity and complexities of every country around it – every city and its story – is both naive and narrow-minded. Similarly, to rule out the possibility of expanding your horizons simply because “near enough is good enough” is not good enough. 
Courtesy of Annie Hickey
And now for the second go-to argument. Of course, traveling is expensive, and, of course, money is an issue entirely relative to each person and his or her circumstances. However, anyone that has travelled for any significant amount of time to any significant place can tell you – there is no price tag to the experience of visiting someplace new. The lessons you learn, the cultures you’re thrust into, the people you meet, the chances you take, the challenges you’ll face, the things that will go right and the things that will go wrong — all of these things are far more powerful and personal than anything – anything – money may claim to buy. 
Here at USC, there are a whole range of opportunities and programs and pathways to allow you — the students — a chance to explore some new, magnificent, challenging part of the world.  You are lucky; you are young and talented and blessed, and the ease of studying abroad when compared to the logistics of traveling as an adult with a full-time job, is something that — should you ignore — you will come to regret. 
Challenge yourself to break out of your comfort zone – to jump and risk everything. And as you do, remember; your hometown isn’t going anywhere. You have a safety net. 
You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. 
Travel doesn’t have to be expensive. Europe is expensive, travel isn’t. Try South East Asia or, somewhere closer to home, anywhere south of the border. You can travel through Mexico for a month for less than you spend on rent in LA. I know, I’ve done it.
