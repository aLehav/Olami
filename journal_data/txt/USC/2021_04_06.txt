Stressed out about your upcoming finals? We’ve compiled a list of TV shows and movies for this month’s streaming guide to help you escape from the tedium of studying. You can live vicariously through the fantasy world of “Shadow and Bone,” take a blast to the past with the classic “Legally Blonde,” or get lost in the whimsical “Moonrise Kingdom.” And for a shot of USC pride, we’ve included some films and TV shows with prominent USC alumni.  
Netflix
“Shadow and Bone”
This upcoming fantasy television series, developed by Eric Heisserer for Netflix, is based on the Grisha trilogy and the “Six of Crows” duology by Leigh Bardugo. “Shadow and Bone” revolves around Alina Starkov, a lowly soldier and orphan, who discovers that she possesses an extraordinary power that could set her people free.
I’ll be the first to admit that I was a little disappointed that Netflix was planning on adapting both works rather than just “Six of Crows” — I found the Grisha trilogy rather lackluster in comparison to “Six of Crows,” and its amazing combination of the heist and fantasy genre.
But after watching the trailer and seeing the inspired casting choices (Starkov, for example, has been retconned to be half-Shu and is played by the half Chinese Jessie Mei Li), amazing visual effects and reports that the more problematic aspects of the “Shadow and Bone” trilogy would be improved, I’m very optimistic about this adaptation of perhaps one of the most popular Young Adult fantasy releases of the decade. Watch out for USC alumnus Calahan Skogman, who got his MFA in acting from USC and is playing Matthias Helvar. 
“Legally Blonde”
I’ve watched “Legally Blonde” three times and still haven’t gotten tired of it. It’s a 2000s comedy classic about a sorority socialite named Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), who decides to follow her ex to Harvard Law School and soon realizes what was once just a ploy to get her (frankly terrible) boyfriend back is actually something that she excels at. 
It’s a pretty simplistic message, but I’ve always appreciated how “Legally Blonde” shows that women can be unapologetically feminine but smart and driven at the same time. I love how the film mixes courtroom drama with fashion and romance — you’ll find yourself rooting for Elle’s success as she strolls into campus in head-to-toe pink. Reese Witherspoon is effortlessly charming as Elle Woods, and I always find myself getting a burst of motivation after I finish the film. Also, if you ever find yourself missing campus,this film may be a respite; despite the film being set at Harvard, it was actually shot at USC! 
Hulu
“Napoleon Dynamite”
This 2004 independent movie directed by Jared Hess and produced by Chris Wyatt and Sean Covel — both alumni of the School of Cinematic Arts — became a legendary film for making audiences laugh during its debut at the Sundance Festival and is now one of the most quoted films ever. 
Its quiet absurdism and deadpan humor could have alienated audiences, but combined with the oddly sweet interactions between the characters and realistic portrayal of high school life, viewers were instead endeared even more. Featuring one of the most legendary dance scenes of all time and instantly quotable lines — “Vote for Pedro,” anyone? — you’ll find yourself charmed by the quiet Midwestern setting and quirky characters.
“Arrival”
I love Emma Stone and “La La Land,” but I still firmly believe that Amy Adams should have won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in “Arrival.”
Based on the 1998 short story “Story of Your Life” by Ted Chiang, this science-fiction drama completely blew my mind after I thought it was just going to be a typical alien film. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and produced by Shawn Levy — who graduated from USC with an MFA in Production in 1994 — “Arrival” not only explores communication with extraterrestrial intelligence in a refreshing (and realistic) manner but also brings up thought-provoking questions about how our personal relationships can warp and bend with time.
After watching so many films where aliens are just the enemies for the human characters to shoot into oblivion (the expendable CGI aliens in the Marvel Cinematic Universe come to mind), I was fascinated by how this film instead made me question what it truly means to be human.   
Amazon Prime Video
“Moonrise Kingdom” 
Wes Anderson films are the poster-children of quirky, aesthetic films and for good reason: With their exquisite color palettes, subtle comedy and eccentric characters, any Wes Anderson film is instantly recognizable and unforgettable. “Moonrise Kingdom” is a coming-of-age film that revolves around a pair of young lovers, Sam and Suzy, who escape their New England town due to their feelings of alienation from their guardians and peers.
You’ll find yourself captivated by the lush cinematography and the awkward yet sweet romance between Sam and Suzy. Anderson never treats the young characters with kid gloves, instead showcasing their maturity and genuine care for one another. I’ve always wanted to go on an adventure, maps and all, like the one that these two embark on, so this film has always been a comfort film for me when I feel restless. 
HBO Max
“The Nevers”
This sci-fi fantasy television series revolves around a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with abnormal powers after a supernatural event.
While not many details about the show have been released, I’m intrigued by the show’s blending of sci-fi and fantasy elements as well as how it discusses the simultaneous persecution and power of women in a period setting. I’m always down to see women kick a lot of ass in gorgeous period clothing, but I was also pleasantly surprised that the cast is relatively diverse for a Victorian TV show, which usually features only white characters. HBO rarely lets me down when it comes to their original TV shows, so I’m optimistic that “The Nevers” will be a worthy successor to shows like “Watchmen” and “Big Little Lies.”

The challenges of the pandemic have not stopped Munachimso “Muna” Mbaezue, a sophomore majoring in musical theatre, from creating new inspirational works of art. He has continued to find new ways to collaborate with other artists, express his creativity and use his art as a medium for advocacy. 
This is shown in his latest film that he directed, “The Principles of Progeny,” which is part of “THE MOVEMENT: It Continues…” a larger project spearheaded by Mbaezue. According to the USC Musical Theatre program, the film “explores the two-dimensional legacy of the enslavement and colonization of Black and non-black peoples. The student-produced production showcases the contemporary and historic lenses of Black excellence through song, storytelling and dance.”
It premiered live through Zoom on Feb. 26 and was done in collaboration with two other sophomore artists in Mbaezue’s cohort, Talha Barberousse and Nia Otchere-Sarfo, and under the faculty advisement of professor Karen Parks, the head of music in musical theatre. In honor of Black History Month, Mbaezue wanted to showcase the resilience of the movement for Black lives. 
“Professor Karen Parks, she was our faculty adviser, a woman who grew up in the movement, which motivated us to name the piece and would also be a title for our coming pieces, ‘THE MOVEMENT: It Continues,’” Mbaezue said. “Because we seek to make art that showcases the resilience of the movement. And that is the movement for Black joy, liberation, and everything that comes with that.” 
The meaning of “The Principles of Progeny”
Parks was born in South Carolina with a mother active in the civil rights movement.
“I was raised very much understanding who I was,” Parks said. “Coming from that background, to hear that Muna and the other students were interested in continuing this movement that I grew up in … to me personally, [it] just means everything because we’re still struggling with this, we’re still talking about this.”
Parks further talked about the continuum of the movement after the murder of George Floyd, the injustice of Breonna Taylor and, in general, the horrible cycle of injustice that persists. 
“The cycle keeps going,” Parks said. “And if we don’t continue this fight, and continue speaking out, then what will happen? We must, but it’s your generation who has to continue to speak out against this.”
Committed to this cause, Mbaezue created “The Principles of Progeny” to not only explore Black excellence but also the continuum of Blackness throughout time. The film opens with a piece called “The Drums of the African Progenies” with a performance by Mbaezue. 
“And so with that piece, I was trying to channel the whole of Blackness, the motherland and Blackness before the contact of whiteness, Blackness before it was Blackness,” Mbaezue said.
Mbaezue recognizes there is a new sense of urgency that’s arisen in discussing the oppression of Blackness on a global scale. Systemic racism has always been an issue globally but the coronavirus pandemic had further spotlighted the need to address this issue. While the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter Movement this past summer was most prominent in the United States, the struggle for racial equity is a global issue. 
“It’s the oppression of Blackness on a global scale,” Mbaezue said. “And just this sense of an impending need for people to, for a lack of better words, get it together.”
With this in mind, Mbaezue wanted to further dissect Black resilience and its relationship with Black joy as it is an act of resilience in itself. 
“The world is headed in a way that we really do have to come together because people are still dying, and not as much has changed from the inception of anti-Black racism, as we would like to believe. So that was my personal message through my pieces in the film,” Mbaezue said.
For Barberousse personally, the film was a celebration of her culture and her history but it also allowed her to fully mourn the events of the past year. 
“It just was kind of a full immersion in my culture for me,” Barberousse said. 
The entire film took nearly two and a half weeks and with such a tight deadline, Mbaezue poured all his energy into this project. His main goal for the film was to truly portray the movement and Black excellence. To do so, Mbaezue focused on getting to know his cast and where their intentions lied for the movement. From this he wanted to create a film that encapsulated all the different layers of Blackness that his cast brought and the different layers within the Black community. Most importantly he wanted to create something that was real for the movement and was not just performative. 
“We asked questions like, how are you an ally in your life? What does allyship mean to you? What does Black History Month mean to you? How do you support the Black people in your life? Do you have Black people in your life?” Barberousse said. “We wanted it to be a very authentic show. And we wanted the product to be something real, and not something performative just so people can put on the Black Lives Matter patch and go about their day.”
Despite the short amount of time Mbaezue and his team had to complete the film, they were all committed to the cause. Both Mbaezue and Barberousse stated that the tight turnaround was one of the biggest challenges in creating “The Principles of Progeny.” As Parks said, “The movement has no timeline.”
The film featured several genres and concepts all of which tied back to Blackness and the progeny of those enslaved in comparison with the reality of the progeny of the enslavers.
“We had the spiritual, we had the hymn, which I did, we had even our African roots, which Muna did because he’s Nigerian. We had jazz, soul, R&B… And we just wanted to cover the Black experience in terms of art for Black History Month,” Barberousse said. “We wanted to discuss from the beginning in Africa, and then upon coming into America, how have the progeny of people who were enslaved, how have they developed in America versus how have the realities of the progeny of the enslavers developed?”
“The Principles of Progeny” also features one of Mbaezue’s very first choral composition pieces. He hopes that he can reperform his pieces from the film with a bigger choir in the future. 
In working closely with Mbaezue with the film and in class, Barberousse became close friends with Mbaezue and truly respects him as an artist and as a director.
“His dedication and attention to detail is unmatched is the first thing that I have to say. His ability to just think of ideas, they just come to his head out of nowhere, and he can just see things in such a cinematic way and make it come to life. He’s just so multitalented. I don’t know how he’s a singer, actor, dancer and now director, choreographer, composer as well. He is literally the entire package, and he won’t let you slack,” Barberousse said. 
As Mbaezue’s professor, Parks also acknowledges his talent and commends him for his enthusiasm for the arts.
“Here’s a young man that has a plan, and I’m a teacher who always has a plan,” Parks said. “I knew then, okay I got a student who really wants to learn.” 
Parks’ method of teaching is centered around truth, both in yourself and your craft.
“His dedication and attention to detail is unmatched is the first thing that I have to say. His ability to just think of ideas, they just come to his head out of nowhere, and he can just see things in such a cinematic way and make it come to life. He’s just so multitalented. I don’t know how he’s a singer, actor, dancer and now director, choreographer, composer as well. He is literally the entire package, and he won’t let you slack.” 
“I teach truth. Find the truth in it and then figure out the why. Because the truth is going to be yours. The why can be anybody’s… [Muna] was immediately like ‘yeah, OK I see’ and I said, whoa okay I have a student who understands my language,” Parks said. 
She additionally described Muna’s discontent with some of the University’s silence after Floyd’s death.
“I said, never wait for an opportunity, create one,” Parks said. “And Muna really showed his directorial skills in that he just took it and said, here’s the idea [for ‘The Principles of Progeny’].”
The vision of Mbaezue’s art 
It is evident that Mbaezue puts all of who he is as an artist into all the pieces he creates. From larger projects like “The Principles of Progeny” to smaller choreographies, covers, and songs on his Instagram account, his main goal as an artist is to create art that is both relevant and accessible. In his art, Mbaezue balances his own drive and motivation with what he can give back to his audience and community. 
“I think there’s a real beauty in just going to your Instagram and seeing a nice two or three-minute video that you can just watch, and it just takes you somewhere for three minutes,” Mbaezue said. 
Whether it is three minutes of joy, peace, rage or sadness that you did not know you had or did not know how to negotiate, he hopes to create art that brings these emotions out of you. Furthermore, he hopes to create art that you simply cannot turn away from.
This vision he has for his art comes from inspiration from three main artists, the first being Fela Kuti, a Nigerian composer and political activist, who is referred to as a pioneer of Afrobeat, which combines traditional Yoruba and Afro-Cuban music with funk and jazz. 
“He was just so much for the resistance and for Black strength in the Black Power movement in Africa, in Nigeria specifically, during the ’70s, the ’80s,” Mbaezue said. “While [his music] did, of course, point a finger at the oppressive government and rally the people, it also created such a community and such a cult following of people who were just so enamored [by him].” 
The next artist Mbaezue obtains his inspiration from is Janelle Monáe, an American singer-songwriter, who he says is an artist that inspires him every day. He explains that it is the way she tells her stories through music and film, the way she uses her platform to showcase other advocates and activists and how she is always out lending a hand when she can that truly moves him. Mbaezue admires her constant advocacy and activism to tangibly bring justice for others and bring a better day.
The third artist Mbaezue brings up as a core source of inspiration is Rebecca Sugar. Sugar is an American animator, singer-songwriter and director/producer for many animated shows such as Steven Universe. 
“She really showed me the importance, and also the negligence, of the power of children’s television. And I think it is something that is really, really underrated, really underrated [is] the ability to instill something in a child, regardless of what kind of home or community they might be raised in,” he said. 
Mbaezue’s past and present self 
Art has always been a part of Mbaezue’s life as he painted and drew as a young child and has played the alto saxophone since the fourth grade. 
“I did that for a while, and I was like, ‘Oh, I definitely want to be a jazz musician when I grow up,’” Muna said.
Mbaezue got into musical theatre much later than most of his peers, doing his first play in the seventh grade when he still lived in Nigeria and his first musical in the fall of his junior year of high school in Texas. He never considered himself a singer, and his roommate at boarding school convinced him his freshman year that he couldn’t sing. Additionally, as a kid, he had terrible stage fright.
“I had crippling stage fright,” Mbaezue said. “As a child, I once weaseled out of doing a debate that I prepared very well for just because of the concept of getting on stage.”
It wasn’t until his first play in the seventh grade that his stage fright began to dissipate. From there, he continued exploring theatre all the way through high school where he landed both smaller roles and leading roles. But for Mbaezue, there was no defining moment in his life that led him to pursue higher education in musical theatre: He did not take any dance or singing classes, and his seventh-grade experience was just part of his journey.
“I don’t know if I had a defining moment in as much as just the general aura of it all. I had known that for a while that I did want to, in some way, pursue acting and higher education, and then I found that you could also do musical theater, and I think just the general atmosphere of being in that space — I just felt pulled to it,” Mbaezue said. 
Part of who Mbaezue is as an artist and as a person is his constant advocacy for his community and for what he believes is right. With this, Mbaezue believes USC can do better for students of color on campus, specifically in the arts.
“In a school with so few Black artists, this is really going to have, I think, a disproportionate effect on the amount of Black art that USC can say is of their students. And I think that there needs to be greater support and greater structural root, systemic or radical change needed to support and enable Black students,” he said. 
Mbaezue explains that tangible support needs to be given to the Black community on campus and in this nation as a whole. 
“I think we all can acknowledge that Black art does not nearly receive the amount of support that it deserves in this nation,” Mbaezue said. “We know that because we see pop culture and we know that pop culture was birthed in minstrelsy, in blackface, and that pop culture in this country was born out of appropriating from Black bodies and Black people. And that cycle hasn’t stopped.”
With this, Mbaezue explains how USC not only has to make deep-rooted and radical changes, but the University also has to change the way they handle Black art and learn how to tangibly give Black student artists access and the backing to create the art. In elaborating on this topic, Mbaezue demonstrates that by the walk of life and the privilege one has, more opportunities arise — opportunities that most Black artists have to fight to obtain. 
“Because of the nature of what we have to go through to get into these spaces, the Black artists you find here will not disappoint you,” Mbaezue said. “And I say that confidently because of what it takes for us to get here. This isn’t something we stumble on. People from other backgrounds can stumble on this.” 
While USC has supported the Black community on campus, Mbaezue feels as though it is mainly for show. 
“It’s the things that turn heads and raise eyebrows in the executive boardroom meetings that USC needs to be doing,” Mbaezue said. “I feel that the issue we see so often is symbolic support, symbolic reparation, symbolic activism, performative activism. I need the University to give us tangible elevation in their means of supporting Black artists, especially because we are such a small community here at USC.” 
To see more of Mbaezue’s works visit his Instagram @bae_zue and the BFA website for his upcoming performance in April for the Spring Inaugural Musical Theater Production. There will also be a second screening for “The Principles of Progeny” on Sunday, April 11 for those interested: Second Screening of “The Principles of Progeny.”

In the virtual classroom setting of “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Crises,” Mallika Jain, Elisa James, Elina Xie and Dea Kurti were challenged to develop an innovative product or service to help solve an issue that was caused or exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. It was in this class, taught by David Gerber, Brad Cracchiola and Daniel Druhora, that the four students began to design their startup company, Refresh LA. 
Refresh LA is an online marketplace that connects surplus food from local restaurants to “price-savvy, eco-friendly customers.” The main goal of Refresh LA is to reduce food waste, in turn also reducing carbon emissions and landfill capacity. The company, which launched on Feb. 8, also aims to support small businesses.
With Refresh LA, the students aim to remedy issues of food waste and decreased sales in the restaurant industry. At the end of each day, local restaurant partners like Dulce, Pot of Cha, Factory Tea Bar and Honeybird inform the team what food items they have left over after their sales. Refresh LA then alerts their customers about the leftover food through text, which is sold to them at a discounted price. 
While researching a topic for their assignment, the group of students recognized how large of a problem food waste is in the United States. Especially during the height of the pandemic when many people were forced to stay at home, restaurants experienced significantly lower sales, resulting in large quantities of wasted food. 
“During COVID, a lot of restaurants were experiencing lower foot traffic and thus decreased sales, so we really thought about this and figured out a solution to serve as a lifeline for small businesses, while also mitigating big picture food waste,” Xie said. 
Customers can shop the food options on Refresh LA’s website and are sent a confirmation email of their purchase which they can pick up during a specified time window. While customers receive delicious snacks at unbeatable prices, restaurants make additional earrings from food that otherwise would have been wasted.
Kurti, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, has a deeper motive behind the company than just sustainability. As a New York City native, she witnessed food being wasted in considerable amounts everyday. Additionally, as the daughter of a small business owner, Kurti understands the impact of a company like Refresh LA.
“My dad owned a small business and when COVID hit, I kind of understood the implications of what that meant for small business owners. My dad was not able to work or to have his employees work for several months,” Kurti said. “As a person who is being raised by a small business owner, that aspect was really important to me and being able to help out small business owners was really incredible.”
After using their passions to establish the company’s foundation, the founders of Refresh LA began to reach out to local businesses in the USC community. Their first partner was Cafe Dulce, which decided to use the profits made through their partnership with Refresh LA to support students struggling with housing and food insecurity during the pandemic. While Refresh LA is currently based out of South Central, they hope to expand to other urban areas and college towns. 
“We started looking at areas where we could have the most impact and really just [realized] we were USC students, we had the most connection to USC places,” said James, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “Then we got a few partners on board, then started marketing to students … and then it’s just grown to have more partners and more customers.”
Refresh LA has also partnered with several USC organizations, such as Trojan Shelter, USC Student Basic Needs, the Sustainability Project, Food SC’ience and Nutrition Club, the Environmental Student Assembly, Students Innovating for Global Challenges and the USC Panhellenic Council, to promote their company and sustainability efforts to other college students. 
“[One] reason that we’re targeting collegiate towns is that word of mouth between friends and between a community spreads a lot quicker than trying to spread the word in a whole city,” said Jain, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration. “The more organizations we can reach out to the better, we have this chance of reaching every student at USC, which is ultimately our goal.”
Despite some initial obstacles in getting restaurant partnerships, Refresh LA credits much of their success to those who have helped them through the process of launching and expanding, especially their app development and design team. The USC Viterbi School of Engineering has also provided the group with immense support, in addition to James Choi, the owner of Cafe Dulce. 
“[James was] our very first partner, and [was] so open to meeting with us and talking with us about how we can be successful, how a business model can run [and] telling us the inner workings of the restaurant industry so we could create a product that would really support restaurant owners,” Jain said.
Refresh LA’s founders are full-time students who manage their own business, and are remaining involved in other organizations on campus. Despite their involvement with Refresh LA being time consuming and demanding, the founders know the greater good that comes with it. 
“There are some weeks that are really stressful, everything’s a time crunch, we’re all working all hands on deck … and those weeks are probably the most difficult with the stress of creating your best work in such a limited amount of time but Refresh is like our baby, we all care about it so much [and] we’re so invested in it,” Xie said.

The Los Angeles Galaxy are one of, if not the premier brand in U.S. soccer. Their jerseys are also sponsored by Herbalife Nutrition, a company that might be a pyramid scheme. Imagine if the Galaxy, and other sports teams, were sponsored by companies that actually meant something to the communities they represent? How many Angelenos would buy L.A. Galaxy merchandise or attend a game if they were sponsored by, say, In-N-Out burger? 
Jersey sponsorships are one of the easiest ways for sports franchises to make money. Unfortunately, these sponsorships are becoming increasingly random, as teams continue to agree to promote the company that offers the most money, regardless of its affiliation to the club. While leagues in the United States are experimenting with commercial advertising on uniforms, European soccer clubs have thrived on these partnerships for decades.
What I find troubling, however, is the lack of creativity that goes into these sponsorship agreements. Club executives usually offer the real estate on their uniforms to the highest bidder, with little to no attention paid to what the brand means to the club, its city and its supporters. 
Uniform sponsorship has become an increasingly vital source of revenue in recent years. Estimates say Manchester United rake in just under $100 million per year on jersey and sleeve sponsorships alone. If companies such as Chevrolet and Kohler continue to shell out absurd amounts of money to place their logo on the front of a jersey or its sleeve, clubs will happily cooperate.
But what if Manchester United signed a jersey sponsorship deal with a company that actually meant something to the residents of Manchester? I’m not saying foreign companies shouldn’t be allowed to advertise in mainstream sports. I’m merely pointing out a missed opportunity. 
When England captain and Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane scores a goal, replays quickly circulate on social media. Tottenham’s jersey sponsor, AIA, is an Asian-Pacific life insurance company. What would happen if Kane’s same highlights spread worldwide, but he was wearing a jersey sponsored by English retailer Tesco?  
Some may argue the London-based grocery outlet can’t pay Tottenham the annual $40 million they expect for a jersey sponsorship, which is likely accurate. But what’s the dollar value on the ability to gain name recognition with non-soccer fans? While no club wants to be known as the “Tesco-club,” there’s value in representing brands fans have personal ties to.
While Tottenham still might not see choosing a local sponsor as a chance for financial growth, less popular clubs should seize the opportunity to do so. Last season, Tottenham and five other clubs brought in an excess of $40 million on their jersey sponsor deal. Nine clubs brought in less than $10 million. For a club like Brighton & Hove Albion, how much worse could Tesco do than the $2 million they receive from American Express? 
If you’re a club fighting for eyeballs in the public sphere, what better way is there to gain recognition and immerse yourself within a community than to promote a beloved local business on your jersey? Current fans won’t abandon the club because of a jersey sponsorship, and new fans can potentially be drawn in purely based on name and brand recognition.
While newly found, casual fans might not necessarily pour the same amount of money into tickets and merchandise as typical fans, they would still bring money into the club. 
This season, 12 of the 20 clubs in England’s Premier League were sponsored by a company involved in either gambling or financial services. Just four clubs represented a company based in the United Kingdom. Instead of awarding sponsorship deals to the highest offer, soccer clubs should be partnering with companies that can help them grow in popularity. While cutting ties with foreign sponsors might be financially irresponsible for clubs such as Tottenham and Manchester United, it should be considered for clubs like Brighton and Sheffield United, who are desperate for viewership and investment. 
England and many other European countries pride themselves on how accessible the game of soccer is to the local community, promoting “grassroots” efforts within the sport. I find it interesting that a highly-anticipated clash between Chelsea and Manchester City in England this season featured a jersey matchup of a Japanese tire company against a Saudi-Arabian airline.
This isn’t meant to be some sort of nationalistic rant against the globalization of the Premier League or the expansion of commerical partnership within sports. I just believe it would be beneficial for clubs on the outside of the public sphere to capitalize on the opportunity to align themselves with their community in a unique way.
I mean, is it just me who’s still dreaming about the In-N-Out jerseys?

When it comes to online financial gurus and those YouTube channels who keep babbling about how I need to invest in the stock market, the buzzword that always pops up is ‘success.’ We inherently value success, and it’s one of the many factors that keeps us motivated to get things done. That being said, success may represent different ideas for different people. 
For some, success may include wrapping up homework before midnight for once and getting to bed early. Others may find success in purchasing their first apartment or finally signing a lease. And those who are overly ambitious may find success in making it on the Forbes ‘30 under 30’ list. 
Success can, therefore, be assumed to be a lifelong goal. The way we live can also be determined to be successful or not depending on certain religious and cultural ideals or material gains. However, to live and age successfully in a biological and physiological sense can be difficult.Gerontology prides itself in finding the secrets to ‘successful aging.’ Being the field that studies aging, it makes sense that we take a stab at determining the ideal lifespan. However, the current social models that persist in the world of gerontology and occupational therapy fail to accurately summarize the smorgasbord of factors that inherently play into the process of aging. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “Are you saying that there’s not a definitive way to age well? I mean, eating vegetables and doubling down on antioxidants are proven to help limit or prevent neurodegenerative diseases through the reduction of oxidative stress. There are clearly ways to age well; what’s the deal with trying to deny that?”
Those arguments are warranted, of course. We know that there are healthy and important ways for aging well: staying in shape, connecting with others — all that fun stuff you can read in a tabloid or off the internet. 
However, we need to refocus our energy to a more positive view of aging that does not implicate older adults into believing that how they’re living is inherently wrong. That being said, people are still able to age ‘successfully.’ But the use of the current paradigm or timeline to determine said ‘success’ is irresponsible and narrow-minded. It creates a utopian mindset that if every older adult were able to fulfill certain steps, we’d be able to ‘solve’ aging. The wording in it of itself is harmful, implying that there is ‘unsuccessful’ aging. Imagine being told you’re growing up wrong.
While simplicity is key in terms of analyzing a dumbfounding amount of data, the reduction and across-the-board approaches to older adults may miss the mark when it comes to efficient interventions. There is a severe lack of comprehensive research in aging when it comes to older people with disabilities, older women, older people of color and those with difficult socioeconomic situations. People who choose to live in assisted living communities live much different lives compared to those who choose to age at home and not enter a nursing home in the first place. 
Policy and practice are key elements to changing how we visualize aging. It’s similar to the conversation that is often had with equity versus equality. Simply giving everyone accessibility to the same resource or program is one thing, but ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to efficiently use those tools is a whole different story. 
In terms of aging, a new model may include recognizing how neighborhood environments play into engagement and willingness to participate in social activities. It may take into account a community’s accessibility to fresh fruits and vegetables compared to communities engulfed by fast food chains. 
The model in turn will provide stronger interventions that may not only put more people to work but also better the aging process altogether. The new California Master Plan for Aging sets a bold example of an intervention for others to follow into the next decade. It values equity and diversity along with recognizing the importance of the caregiver at home.
