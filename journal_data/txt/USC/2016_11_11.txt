On Friday night, the women’s basketball team opened up the 2016-2017 season with an impressive 76-44 win over Hawaii.
The Trojans played efficiently in all aspects of the game recording, 12 steals and shooting 50 percent from the field.
“I thought it was a good chance for us to get a lot of people playing,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We’ve had a few players out with injury (Sadie Edwards and Valerie Higgins) and we wanted to get them some minutes on the court.”
In total, Cooper-Dyke played a whopping 13 players (the bench scored nearly half of the team’s points), including four freshmen in the season debut. The first-year players in particular were given an opportunity to shine and they did not disappoint. Guard Minyon Moore scored 8 points and forward Ja-Tavia Tapley recorded 10 points and five rebounds.
“Our freshmen are very talented and it was great to see them gain some confidence,” said Cooper-Dyke. “With every minute that they were on the court they gained a little bit of confidence.”
In particular, Cooper-Dyke was complimentary of Tapley’s game.
“Ja-Tavia is fantastic because she plays both the 3 and the 4 (positions), and by the time she’s out of here she’ll be playing the 2 and 3 (positions),” Cooper-Dyke said. “That’s just how talented she is.”
The Trojans got off to a fast start thanks to Kristen Simon’s pounding play on the inside. She scored eight first quarter points and finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds. After gaining a commanding 38-18 lead in the second quarter, the Rainbow Wahine went on a mini run clawing to within 13 points of the Trojans.
However, Hawaii would never get that close again. Even when USC was struggling on offense, as it sometimes did in the second half, the defense picked up the slack forcing frequent turnovers late in the shot clock.
“I was very pleased with our defensive pressure,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We want to continue to build in that area so that we can do the fun things like run in the fast break.”
In addition to excellent play from Tapley and Simon, senior guard Jordan Adams played efficiently going 5-of-6 from the field with 11 points. Fellow senior and 3-point specialist Courtney Jaco nailed a 3-pointer from downtown for 9 points while also adding 5 assists, showing that her transition from shooting guard to primary ball handler has been a smooth one. Jaco had the highlight play of the game when she nailed a contested three at the buzzer to end the first quarter.
“I think we are striving to be more consistent every day,” Junior Kristen Simon said. “I think this game we came in a little more focused, with a little more drive and a little more intensity. Hawaii was physical — we saw it on film and they were physical tonight. That kind of kept everyone motivated.”
Next up, the Women of Troy continue non-conference play against UC Riverside on Wednesday at the Galen Center. After that matchup, the team will have to deal with an intense travel schedule as they head to Las Vegas and then Alaska for a tournament in Anchorage.

It’s that time of the year — the flu has settled in at every dorm and sorority house around campus, teachers are cramming papers and projects to be done before Thanksgiving Break, and we have a new president! 
Whether you were with her or with him, the country is definitely in for some big changes. Personally, I’m just glad it’s over. I never thought I’d see the day a Twitter beef was actually referenced in a presidential debate. Clapback season was too real for the radio. I can’t even begin to wrap my head around it because between three papers, two presentations, and one final speech, my schedule is leaving little time to be anxious about the state of the union. If America is going to fall apart anytime soon, I need to get this diploma first, people, and that means getting these grades right! 
In addition to being lost in the sauce throughout this election, I have been very lost in other matters. My future career goals have changed more than the damn temperature lately. I came into college with an interest in pursuing sports medicine and studying kinesiology, but when I learned that USC had gotten rid of this specific major and instead lumped everyone into a generic “human biology” major I was not a happy camper. In fact, I was a very confused camper. 
After a few semesters of being undecided and dabbling in a diverse selection of classes — from fashion and cinema to psychology and advertising — I landed in Annenberg studying communication with an emphasis on public relations and marketing. I thought I had finally found a comfortable place at school and started filling out my resume with various positions in the entertainment world. But I guess what goes around really does come back around. I ended up back where I started…in medicine. 
I don’t know what it was that pulled me out of the stylish world I had landed in and it shook me with vengeance and said “You want to go to medical school!” But with one semester away from graduating I had changed my mind again. A handful of Amazon orders later and my apartment is now filled with countless prep books, medical pre-requisites, and my spring semester is a lot less PR and a lot more ER. I am committed to trading in my job styling big name celebrities for a pair of scrubs and a stethoscope. Soon enough the only thing I’ll be dressing is wounds from people that come into the hospital, but oddly enough I have never felt more on the right path. 
Something that held me back for so long from listening to that little voice that kept telling me from switching paths was fear and doubt. I feared that I would fail and that I wasn’t good enough, especially to go to medical school. I told myself “it’s too late to change your mind now.” I had to stop listening to the voice telling me to stay in my lane and rather listen to the one that was encouraging me to explore those interests. Life is what you make it. I had to realize that at the end of the day my life was in my own hands and it was up to me to make the decisions that would lead to my success and happiness. 
This is my advice to anyone who is currently going through this predicament: Listen to that inner voice. Follow your passions and your interests. Know that it will be hard work and at times it might be scary, but it’s never too late.

So far, my first semester of college has been a bit crazy. Wait, let me rephrase that: my first semester of college has consisted of ups and downs, but mostly of impulsive decisions.
A month ago, I impulsively decided to chop seven inches off my hair. Yes, I wanted to do it for awhile, but the actual ordeal of getting my haircut was impulsive. I went home for the first time in two months and decided to chop my hair off after becoming upset with people from my past. I called my hairstylist, walked into the shop, and came out looking completely different. I didn’t even give it a second thought, but I ended up surprising my friends and family. 
Last week, I made another impulsive decision: I got my nose pierced. Like cutting my hair, it was always something I wanted to do. However, I never acted on the impulse. I love piercings, but, unfortunately, I am terrified of needles. Thus, I never thought I would actually get the piercing, which was always something that saddened me. My friend who knew this encouraged me to get my nose pierced after we got brunch. We were in downtown when I voiced my yearning about wanting a nose piercing. My friend immediately checked Yelp for good piercing places near us and found the perfect one: Tinta Rebelde Art Gallery and Tattoo Studio. We drove to the shop which surprised me as I did not think I would make it into the actual shop. I do not know what happened- or when it happened- but something changed in me and I walked in despite my fear. I was nervous, of course, but I did something I have always wanted to do. 
Ironically, after the piercing I almost passed out because I was overwhelmed by the fact that I actually got the piercing and I stood up too quickly, but that was not what I took away from that day. I learned that I have changed in college and changed for the better. For the first time in my life, I am completely in control and no one is watching over me, so I am doing things and making decisions that I have always wanted to do. 
I no longer am scared of what people will think of me or the consequences of my actions because I have realized that every decision I have made has been a good one because I have wanted to do it. And maybe that’s the point of college – making instantaneous decisions that make you happy or help you grow. I feel completely different than the person I was when I walked onto campus in August. I can genuinely say to others that I am a more mature, happier person who might make crazy decisions, but they are decisions I want to make so I will keep on making them.

Image courtesy of Heather McDonaldFighting back · USC alumna and Los Angeles-based comedian Heather McDonald came forward about being sexually harassed by a UC Regent.
When Heather McDonald first heard University of California regent Norman Pattiz make what she said were sexual remarks about her clothing and body, she initially brushed them off. McDonald was working at the radio company PodcastOne, where Pattiz is the executive chairman, and she felt uncomfortable as a result of what she said was verbal harassment by Pattiz. However, she believed that by avoiding Pattiz, she could continue to record her podcast, Juicy Scoop, in peace.
 But as McDonald said the comments became increasingly offensive, she realized this strategy wouldn’t work. Instead, she played an audio recording of one of her encounters with Pattiz on the Oct. 27 episode of her podcast.
On the recording, Pattiz is heard saying, “Can I hold your breasts?”
When McDonald said no, Pattiz said his hands were “memory foam.”
McDonald also said that Pattiz once joked about following her into a women’s restroom and made derogatory remarks to Ji Min Park, who left PodcastOne in August after saying that Pattiz sexually harassed her, telling her that she looked like a schoolgirl and that he had watched many videos with schoolgirls in them.
For McDonald, comments like these made her feel inferior.
“It makes you feel inadequate,” McDonald said. “It keeps you from being the successful person you want to be because it makes you uncomfortable.”
McDonald, who left PodcastOne soon after the alleged incident, said she was hesitant to discuss the comments Pattiz made toward her at first, but she became motivated to come out with her story after other women accused then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes of sexual assault and harassment. McDonald said that after she discussed her experiences, many women emailed her to show their support and share their stories of harassment at the hands of male superiors and coworkers.
“Since I’ve come forward with the story, I’ve been besieged with hundreds of emails of long stories from women who are 20 to women who are 50 and 60 who remember situations of sexual harassment,” McDonald said. “I want men to know that their words last forever.”
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Pattiz apologized for his comments.
“There is no excuse for any such comments or making anyone feel uncomfortable,” Pattiz said. “If I did that, I sincerely apologize, and it will be a valuable learning experience.”
Amanda Deutchman, a spokesperson for PodcastOne, declined requests for further comment.
While the UC system has policies regarding how sexual harassment on campus is handled, it is uncertain how these policies affect people like Pattiz, who have allegedly committed these acts off campus.
Monica Lozano, chair of the UC Board of Regents, said in an email statement that she did not take the allegations against Pattiz lightly.
“We take the allegations of sexual harassment against Regent Norman Pattiz very seriously and find his comments as reported to be inappropriate and highly offensive,” Lozano wrote. “Current UC Board of Regents policies do not specifically address the behavior of members while they are not engaged in University business, but I intend to bring forward new policies that will remedy this. We cannot tolerate behavior that violates the University’s Statement of Ethical Values.”
McDonald, however, said she does not feel the UC system took a strong enough stance against Pattiz, saying that he should not be allowed to affect campus sexual assault policies in his position as a regent.
“I don’t think a 73-year-old man who has perpetually sexually harassed females in the workplace should be making decisions on how sexual harassment is treated on college campuses,” McDonald said. “My step-daughter is 17 and applying to UC schools, and she could be in a place where if she’s sexually harassed or hurt by someone who is rich and powerful, it won’t get the same kind of attention because of the status of the [perpetrator].”
McDonald said she is proud to have spoken about her experiences and hopes she can inspire other women to come forward with their stories of sexual harassment or assault.
“I had a Hollywood publicist tell me ‘you don’t want this to define you,’ and I said ‘I would love it to define me,’” McDonald said of her statements against Pattiz. “‘What do I want to be known as: someone who can do a Drew Barrymore impression better than anyone else, or Heather McDonald, a comedian who spoke up about her situation and inspired others to speak as well?’”

Ziru Ling | Daily TrojanAgainst hate · Lisa Hines, Melina Abdullah, Pete White and Nyallah Noah discussed Black Lives Matter and relevant issues on Thursday.
Every seat in the Sol Price School of Public Policy auditorium on Thursday evening was covered with a paper that said, “Two students were called ‘n—gger’ today.” The flyers, which referenced two incidents of bias that had flared up on campus in recent days, were part of a panel discussion on the status of the Black Lives Matter movement and its role following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. 
The panelists included Lisa Hines, the mother of a woman who died while in LAPD custody; Melina Abdullah, a professor of pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles; Pete White, founder of the Los Angeles Community Action Network; and Nyallah Noah, a sophomore majoring in popular music and a member of Black Lives Matter LA. The event was moderated by LaMikia Castillo, an adjunct professor at the Price School. 
Trump has long been accused of racism by activists due to his encouragement of stricter policing as well as support he has received from white supremacists like the Ku Klux Klan. Over the past several days, claims of racist acts carried out by his supporters have appeared across the nation. Noah expressed her astonishment at the continuing racism around the country and her realization of the necessity of movements such as Black Lives Matter movement.
“The reality is that this country isn’t that open-minded and that there’s a lot of hatred around this country that was suppressed during the Obama era that is finally coming out,” Noah said. “Just as we want to see change, they want to see their type of change as well. That’s why this movement is so much more important now than it ever was.”
Abdullah said that a sustained movement was all the more necessary because anger at injustice couldn’t just flare up every time someone is killed, as it did during a series of highly publicized police shootings of unarmed black people across the country over the past few years. 
“We have to engage in the black radical tradition,” Abdullah said. “And for me, the question is what the black radical tradition looks like now. I find the answer in Black Lives Matter, and feel that Black Lives Matter supports who I am as a black mother.”
Hines had a more personal reason for joining Black Lives Matter. Following the death of her daughter Wakiesha Wilson, who was found in a Los Angeles jail days after missing her trial in court, Hines immediately joined the movement to support other individuals facing forms of oppression.
“My daughter is not resting, and will not rest, until we get justice,” Hines said. “For me, the only way I can get justice is by being part of a movement that stands up to our oppressors. You don’t want to get involved until it happens to you, and now even though it’s for my own child that I’m fighting for, I know that it’s not all about her — it’s about all of us.”
Some of the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement, White said, are to promote equality of diverse groups, to ensure the safety of black people across the country and to decrease funding for the police. For the final goal, White rationalized the importance of using funds from police departments to instead create larger budgets for housing and other safety nets for underprivileged groups. Beyond that, however, White discussed the subliminal threat police represent through historical instances of police brutality against the black community.
“Police are not just slave catchers — at every point in history, they were used to oppress any movement that attempted to create greater equity,” White said. “That’s why a big goal of Black Lives Matter is to decrease funding for the police — because at a certain point, the police are no longer keeping us safe.”
Abdullah added that one of the best ways to support the movement is to show up.
“Yes, we do need financial support among other kinds of support,” Abdullah said. “But beyond that, we need your skills — whatever you can bring to the table — whether it’s singing, dancing or just being present. That’s the most important thing we need from our black supporters and our allies in general: just be present, and that’ll make us that much stronger.”
Defund the Left. The Left cannot sell its evil without heavy tax subsidy and judge-made law.
“Defund the police” what happened to better training? Body Cameras? Better equipment? It sounds like they want to allow crime to happen just so misunderstandings don’t occur. Get Real More policing has been proven to be beneficial for inner cities and poor black communities. We can look at New York City Stop and Frisk for just as much evidence.

Rohit Varma was named dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC on Wednesday by Provost Michael Quick on behalf of President C. L. Max Nikias. Varma, who has served as interim dean since March, will also hold the May S. and John Hooval Dean’s Chair in Medicine.
“It is an honor and a privilege to have been chosen to serve the Keck School of Medicine as dean,” Varma wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I am inspired by the work of our faculty, students and staff who continue to push boundaries and forge new paths in medical education, basic and clinical research and patient care. I am committed to President Nikias’ vision of becoming the premier academic medical center in Southern California, with global recognition in patient care, the basic sciences and translational research with an emphasis on biotechnology.”
Varma is a professor of ophthalmology and preventive medicine at Keck. He holds the Grace and Emery Beardsley Chair in Ophthalmology, is the chair of the USC Care Board of Directors and serves as president of USC Care. He earned his medical degree at the University of Delhi, India and a Masters in Public Health from Johns Hopkins University. 
Varma primarily researches eye disease in children and aging populations. He is an expert on changes in the optic nerve in glaucoma and is currently studying new imaging techniques in the early diagnosis of optic nerve damage arising from this illness.
“It’s amazing to have a dean who is so well established in his field,” said Meleeka Akbarpour, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “The work that he’s done for those with glaucoma and other eye diseases is inspiring, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the Keck undergraduate program grows with him as dean.”
In addition to his research, Varma is the principal investigator of the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, the Chinese American Eye Study, the Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Diseases Study and the African American Eye Disease Study. He has authored over 247 articles in peer reviewed ophthalmic journals and has co-authored two ophthalmic books.

Several hundred middle and high schoolers from the 32nd Street School gathered on campus Thursday afternoon to protest Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. 
They were joined by USC students and faculty as they marched down Trousdale, eventually gathering near Tommy Trojan and chanting “Not our president” and “Si, se puede,” or“yes, we can” in Spanish. Many held signs proclaiming solidarity with minority groups and denouncing Trump and the Republican Party as fascist. Others held up flags from Mexico and El Salvador, expressing solidarity in reference to Trump’s claims that he would deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants currently residing in the U.S.
“We are proud of our country,” one protester holding up a Salvadoran flag said in Spanish. “We want to tell Donald Trump that he cannot deport us, and that he cannot destroy us.” 
Students explained that seniors at the 32nd Street School collectively decided to come to USC in order to “make their voices heard.” 
“We’re very upset about what happened during the election and how many people were influenced by hate,” said Reginald Albert, a high school senior from the 32nd Street School. 
Other protestors held up the rainbow flag of the LGBT movement while many chanted “the people united will never be divided.” The group rallied in front of the Student Union, then began to disperse as some moved toward Exposition Park while others marched out onto Figueroa Street. USC students and faculty formed a “human wall” along Trousdale, then gathered around Tommy Trojan to take turns speaking about what the possibility of a Trump presidency means for them.
One student said that as an undocumented immigrant, she had been taken in by a white woman who helped her eventually get to USC. She urged students to stay united against hate in the face of divisive rhetoric. 
“This proves that not everyone is racist,” she said. “There are good people out there.” 
By 1:00 p.m., the majority of the protesters had moved off campus. A group of around 200 people from USC made its way down Figueroa Street toward Downtown, where 
A group marched back onto campus near 2:00 p.m. yelling, “F–k Donald Trump” as they moved down Trousdale Parkway toward Tommy Trojan. Late Thursday evening, another group gathered at Tommy Trojan and marched downtown, where they assembled in front of City Hall in further protest.
The Office of the Provost issued a statement Thursday evening recognizing the discontent that has spread throughout campus and saying that it would not allow “abuse, threats, harassment, intimidation or violence” targeted toward any members of the USC community. The statement, which was signed by Provost Michael Quick, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, urged students to report incidents of bias online or through USC’s LiveSafe app. 
“Given the fact that our community reflects such a profound pluralism of experiences, identities, perspectives, and beliefs, it is inevitable that we will sometimes face deep disagreements regarding fundamental issues,” the email statement said. “However, as a cherished community of scholars and artists, we have the unique opportunity and the shared responsibility to model how we engage, interrogate, and reconcile our differences with civility, respect, and empathy.”
Verbally challenged people often express themselves by rioting, shouting crude remarks, and drawing graffiti–all poorly constructed narratives that suggest they can only appear to be rather than be. Go figure. John Little, Sr.
These protesters are angry Trump got elected because they feel Trump is heavy handed in imposing his will against others. So these protesters decide to mob up and stop traffic, disrupt businesses, damage other people’s property and even threaten violence against those that disagree with them. Oh sweet irony!!!
Children have temper tantrums.  What can i tell you.  Their “rally” broke up when parents texted that their allowances would be cut off if they were late for dinner.
Is anybody teaching these kids that we don’t always get what we want in life?  Sometimes, that’s a good thing.
