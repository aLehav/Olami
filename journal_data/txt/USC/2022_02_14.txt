If your relationship status is single this Valentine’s Day, you can still find a way to enjoy the holiday — or at least find a way to make it more bearable. 
This day can be lonely, especially if you feel as if everyone around you is getting struck by Cupid’s arrow and consequently indulging in love songs and overpriced roses from their special someone.Getting through a day about love when you aren’t loving love at the moment can seem like an impossible task, but with the right playlist, it doesn’t have to be. 
So if you are longing for a special someone who doesn’t know you like them, missing your ex or just happy with being single, there is a song that is perfect for you on this list. 
…If you’re single and loving it
“Soulmate” (Lizzo)
Who says you need a romantic partner to be thriving? There is nothing wrong with learning to fall in love with yourself and taking some time for self care this Valentine’s Day. Maybe treat yourself to some flowers from Trader Joe’s or a meal that isn’t from a dining hall. Make Feb. 14 your special day! 
Not everyone will understand why you don’t long for love or wish to put yourself out there romantically, and that’s OK. You don’t need a date to have an incredible Valentine’s Day. If you have a “me, myself kinda attitude,” this empowering song is one you want to have on repeat. 
…If you’re single and angry at your ex
“good 4 u” (Olivia Rodrigo)
Being single doesn’t have to be a brutal experience, but if you are enraged and full of despair about someone who wronged you or broke your heart, this is your song for sure. Olivia Rodrigo’s angsty lyrics capture the feeling of watching your ex living their best life after you broke up. And if you’re looking for some more heartbreak worthy songs, give the rest of Olivia’s album “Sour” a listen if you haven’t already. Blast this song at top volume, wear some purple and plot your revenge (just don’t cover everything in gasoline and light the place on fire in the process). 
…If you’re single and don’t understand why everyone is in love
“Crush Culture” (Conan Gray)
Are all of your friends madly in love this semester? Is someone you know getting a ton of Missed Connections (or submitting them for other people)? Do you not understand why people are so obsessed with romance? Then “Crush Culture,” Gray’s iconic bop, is the song for you! 
If you’re feeling annoyed by the couples you see holding hands and making out right outside of your dorm building (and everywhere else on campus), just grab your earbuds, press play and listen to Conan Gray’s anti-love song masterpiece. 
…If you’re single but hopeful that you’ll meet “the one” soon
“Haven’t Met You Yet” (Michael Bublé)
If you are a firm believer in the saying “There is someone out there for everyone,” this is the perfect song for you. Whether you are waiting for one of your friends to set you up on a date, or you’re trying to meet someone on an app, you can listen to this upbeat love song as you wait for your “meet cute” moment to happen. 
Everyone deserves to live out the rom-com fantasy of their dreams, and it’s only a matter of time before you get to experience yours. Just be patient, love is just around the corner. 
…If you’re single and you feel like you are not the kind of person that people fall in love with
“At Seventeen” (Janis Ian)
Now if you don’t believe that love is just around the corner, Janis Ian’s soul-crushing song is perfect to curl up in a ball and cry to and might be more your speed. 
Performed during the very first SNL episode ever, At Seventeen is anything but hilarious. Instead, the song pays tribute to anyone who feels like they aren’t worthy of being loved because they don’t feel as beautiful as those around them. If you are feeling hopeless this Valentine’s Day, this song might not be able to take away that lonely feeling, but it may help you realize that you are not alone and that other people can relate to what you’re going through. 
…If you’re single and you just broke up with someone because you finally told them how much they have hurt you
“This Is The Last Time” (Keane)
For such a tragic message, Keane manages to have this song sound empowering and relatively upbeat. “This Is The Last Time’’ is exactly the song you need in your life if you broke up with someone before Valentine’s Day, or if it’s your first Valentine’s Day being single after a while.
But if you’re still in a toxic relationship, this song just might give you the courage to stand up to your partner for the last time and move on to a happier, healthier relationship in the future. Whatever your feelings are on the 14th, “This Is The Last Time,” or any of the songs in this list just might help fill a void in your heart and embrace being single.

Music and film often go hand in hand. 
The emotional cues of music enhance a film, and recently, musicians have been creating short films to accompany the release of their music. One notable pop artist who made headlines in 2020 was Lady Gaga for her “911” music video.
Amassing over 71 million views on YouTube, it is reasonable to say this was a widely popularized video. In an interview with Vogue, Gaga said the inspiration behind “911” was an antipsychotic medication, Olanzapine, prescribed to the singer. The video attempted to visualize the “poetry of pain” as well as represent a connection between reality and dreams.
Gaga opted to structure her music video from the lesser-known surrealist film, “The Color of Pomegranates.” Released in 1969, “The Color of Pomegranates” is director Sergei Parajanov’s masterpiece.
Inspired by the life of 18th century Armenian poet Sayat-Nova, one of the most notable features of “The Color of Pomegranates’’ is the lack of dialogue. 
Instead, it plays almost like an elongated poem, with short verses introducing each chapter, and rich set designs and carefully choreographed movements visually depicting the story. In Sayat-Nova’s poems, daggers, silks, brocades, sackcloths and ashes were all symbols of love. Playing with the heavy use of metaphors, the beautifully designed sets of Parajanov’s film reflect the same intricacy and depth of meaning.
The opening shot of “The Color of Pomegranates” is a single verse, reading, “I am the man whose life and soul are torment.” Three pomegranates proceed to bleed out onto a white cloth, and it becomes apparent that this film is not a direct depiction of a historical figure’s life but rather a more intimate dissection of Sayat Nova’s experiences and mentality.
Already, there appears to be a connection between the first line of the film and the purpose behind “911.” In keeping with Gaga’s idea of the “poetry of pain,” starting a film about a poet’s life with the line “I am a man whose life and soul are torment” appears to align precisely with the central theme of the song. However, more than this obvious connection, the visual depiction of the “911” music video connects on a deeper level to “The Color of Pomegranates.”
In the opening shot of “911,” Gaga, wrapped in multi-colored fabrics, lies alone in the sand with pomegranates at her feet. The parallel between the pomegranates at Gaga’s feet and the pomegranates that bleed onto the white sheet at the beginning of “The Color of Pomegranates” are also symbolic of another main quality of Sayat-Nova: isolationism.
Before analyzing his work, we must understand a few things about Sayat-Nova. Born in 1712, Sayat-Nova was an ashough, or traveling musician. Through this experience, he created new styles of music and poetry. An element of self-awareness and separation is clearly present in his love poetry, no doubt influenced by the traveling aspect of his life. 
Gaga’s video and Parajanov’s film both use pomegranates to further depict Sayat-Nova’s themes of isolationism. Dating back to the Ancient Greeks, pomegranates have been representative of both fertility and death. The pomegranates, bleeding out onto the sheet in the film and cast away at Gaga’s feet in the music video, create a space between the individual and the perceived plethora of love. In this sense, through Lady Gaga, Parajanov and Sayat-Nova, a multigenerational story is being told regarding isolation and love. 
Moreso than this symbolic analysis of the “911” music video and “The Color of Pomegranates,” Parajanov’s work does provide a bridge between the modern art world and that of centuries ago.
Whether intentional or not, Lady Gaga did more than pay homage to a brilliant surrealist filmmaker. Instead, she linked herself to an ever-growing chain of artists who continually adapt past works into modern pieces. Now, because of the “911” music video and “The Color of Pomegranates,” a direct connection can be placed from an existing artwork from 2020 to a poet from the 18th century.
Seeing Sayat-Nova’s poetry develop into a film and later into a music video proves art is a consistent movement, layering itself constantly on the past. However, these works of art, whether from the 18th century or the 20th, prove human emotion is universal, and the problems and feelings of the past can be seen just as clearly in the present. Nothing has changed; we are the same.

In 2019, Netflix released a generation-defining film — “Tall Girl,” chronicling the trials and tribulations of life as a wealthy, white, 6-foot-1-inch girl. 
On Friday, Netflix released just what the world needed most in this dark hour: a sequel. If you want something with the same level of quality and unwatchability as “Tall Girl,” “Tall Girl 2” does not disappoint.
“Tall Girl 2” begins with leads Jodi (Ava Michelle) and Jack Dunkleman (Griffin Gluck) — who, for some undefined reason, chooses to go by his last name — as they give a full, direct summary of the last movie directly to the camera (and thank God for that, as the first “Tall Girl” was just so hard to follow). 
The film then goes on to follow Jodi and Dunkleman’s new relationship following the events of the prior film. “Tall Girl 2” examines their breakup and will-they-won’t-they get back together tension and offers the redemption arc for former villains Kimmy (Clara Wilsey) and Stig (Luke Eisner). Most importantly, it highlights Jodi’s onslaught regarding her newfound popularity.
Yes, after Jodi’s bitter anti-bullying homecoming speech in one of the most hideous suits ever put on screen in the first “Tall Girl,” she has actually managed to become popular. She gets compliments on her cold shoulder sweatshirts in the halls, fields friendly students seeking moral and philosophical advice, and even gets the lead in the school play. However, with this popularity, she experiences something for the first time in her life — anxiety. 
Seriously — it appears that “Tall Girl 2” is suggesting that Jodi had never before experienced self-doubt or anxiety, which not only completely reframes the picture of the first movie but also asks a larger question for Jodi’s mental state before this. 
Was she a narcissist or was she just incredibly closed off from the world around her? Because there are very few explanations to someone never experiencing self-doubt before, especially if they just had an entire movie made about their insecurities.
Worsening this weird mental health implication, the writers just cannot write characters who behave like real people, such as having Jodi not understanding valid emotional reactions to her behavior or impulsively burning very prized, inflammable possessions, as the writers attempt to depict her trying to move on. 
It’s not just Jodi that this film presents in a poorly characterized way. Dunkleman’s obsession with Jodi grows to new heights, up to the point of him almost throwing away a several hundred dollar camera (like, fully throwing it away into a trash bag) out of a desire to cleanse himself after the breakup. 
Whereas the first movie focused on insecurities of height, this one now appears to be angling towards mental health in teens in general. Although a movie about that could be interesting, this is “Tall Girl 2,” so instead, everyone is just unhinged and unrelatable.
However, beyond the deep, foundational mental health shifts from the first movie, the familiar writing and technical construction of “Tall Girl 2” also manages to help the movie keep its off-kilter, unwatchable charm. The film continues to keep unnecessary, random plot lines and characters, such as an entire C-plot about Stig’s sister visiting from Sweden and Kimmy learning how to be nice.
Meanwhile, the audience only gets a very, very cursory acknowledgment of the political controversies of making a pitying movie about a wealthy, white, able-bodied, cishet girl from New Orleans in the form of a teacher asking, “What would you say to people who don’t think that being tall is a real problem? Getting a terminal illness, being homeless, not knowing where your next meal is coming from. Those are real problems . . . what do you have to complain about?” 
Of course, this question is privileged with a brief, 30-second response on the relativity of pain. Then the teacher is satisfied and the film moves on.
Furthermore, every scene is accompanied by a creeping, strange, ever-present score that sounds like it would be a backing track to the Episode app, and the production seems to have gone a little over-eagre on the color correction to try and distract the viewer from the mess happening in front of them. 
The costuming was still bland and unflattering and felt almost cruel to Michelle given how terribly they insisted on dressing her (though they kind of crushed it when it came to Gluck’s wardrobe). The actors try their best, but in this environment, and with their somewhat lacking skill sets, Michelle and many others come off as bland and distant. 
“Tall Girl 2” visibly lacks effort. It’s 97 minutes of a movie that you would happen to see on Disney Channel and think, “Wow, I miss old Disney. It’s really gone downhill.”
To be fair, it’s either a movie about a privileged girl who’s kind of tall or a nuanced, complex allegory for the experience and media representation of psychosis and deep psychological difficulties in white womanhood and the teen generation. But either way, it’s bad.

For the uninitiated, the January transfer window might seem a little strange from a distance, but really, it works similarly to the NBA trade deadline — a last-gasp opportunity for teams to retool in pursuit of a title, qualification spots for European competition or just to avoid relegation. 
Typically, clubs spend less money on players in January, but occasionally, massive deals still take place, such as Philippe Coutinho’s $148.50 million move to Barcelona in January 2018 or the $93.12 million Liverpool spent to sign Virgil Van Dijk in that same window.
Few transfers even approached those heights in this window, but one move in particular attracted considerable attention after being the focus of the rumor mill in December and early January: Dušan Vlahovic’s $89.76 million transfer from Fiorentina to Juventus. 
Juventus made a series of smart decisions in January — a huge step forward for a club that has stumbled and signed players haphazardly in recent windows. Vlahovic is the latest Fiorentina starlet to move to Juventus, joining Federico Chiesa and Federico Bernardeschi in Turin, after scoring 18 goals and posting 4 assists in 22 starts in Serie A. 
The Serbian striker exploded in 2021 with his slick movement and elite finishing, particularly with his left foot. He’s the kind of striker that only needs a few touches to affect a game. To the delight of Juve fans, he scored a classy debut goal against Hellas Verona, lifting the ball over the keeper with the outside of his left boot. 
If Vlahovic can routinely score 20-plus goals a season for Juventus, he’ll be well worth his expensive fee. Fellow debutant Denis Zakaria also scored against Verona, showcasing his box-to-box movement and dribbling ability he’ll bring to the Juventus midfield. 
Zakaria has had somewhat of a down season but he still ranks well above average for midfielders in Europe with 1.5 dribbles completed per ninety minutes and his drop in form meant that Juventus could sign him cheaply — for less than $10 million. It’s probably too late in the season for Juve to make a serious title challenge, but Vlahovi and Zakaria will certainly help in their push to secure Champions League football. 
The club also sold Rodrigo Bentancur to Tottenham Hotspur for a solid $20.90 million fee and allowed Dejan Kulusevski and Aaron Ramsey to go out on loan, neither of whom have played significant minutes this season. This transfer window appears to be the beginning of a much needed squad renewal process for Juve to return to competing for titles.
Speaking of renewal, Liverpool appear to have found their latest star attacker and a potential replacement for Sadio Mané as the Senegalese superstar approaches his 30s. Liverpool beat out Tottenham in a bidding war for FC Porto’s Luis Díaz, signing the Colombian winger for $49.50 million — a significant fee for a club that doesn’t spend big without carefully scouting a player and crafting a plan for how to integrate him. 
Díaz scorched the Portuguese league in the first half of the season, tallying 14 goals and 5 assists through 18 appearances. He’s a ball-dominant winger who plays mostly on the left side, attempting a lot of dribbles and frequently surging into the penalty area to shoot with his right. 
Stylistically, if Díaz’s production translates to the Premier League, he’ll offer a profile similar to Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, just on the opposite side of the field. Díaz may play a muted role the rest of this season, but don’t be surprised if he and Diogo Jota, who has scored a goal for every 136 minutes played in the Premier League this season, firmly replace Mané and Roberto Firmino in the starting 11 next season. 
Moving from the top to the bottom end of the Premier League, Newcastle have flexed their newfound financial muscle in a desperate attempt to secure their Premier League status. 
Currently sitting at 17th, Newcastle needed reinforcements across the pitch to bolster their talent-starved squad — and for the most part, they succeeded. Newcastle may have overpaid for a few players, but from a personnel perspective, they did smart business. 
The crown jewel of the window is Bruno Guimarães, a midfielder from Lyon who can progress the ball both with passing and dribbling to tremendous effect. He’s the kind of midfielder who can act as a metronome and really control a match. Guimarães did not come cheap at $46.31 million, but he’s a Champions League quality player who will instantaneously take Newcastle’s midfield up a level. 
In the defense, Kieran Trippier, Dan Burn and Matt Targett have arrived to add solidity. 
Burn is a tactically-flexible defender who can play in a back three or back four and has surprisingly good on-ball ability for a nearly 6-foot-6 defender. Trippier in particular is a coup for the club, considering he is just six months removed from winning a La Liga title with Atlético Madrid. Trippier brings superb set-piece delivery and is also a top-level progressive passer, which will help connect Newcastle in build-up play. 
Post January, Manager Eddie Howe should possess enough talent to sail Newcastle to safety.
The moves made in the January transfer window won’t cause major momentum shifts in the various title races around Europe, but they will have consequences for the clubs chasing European competition and those seeking to avoid relegation. 
With the signings they make, clubs can affect their competitive and financial futures for better or worse in the January window.

In the midst of these unexpected, turbulent times, I can always be sure of one thing when I wake up: friends and family sending me their Wordle scores. Those yellow, green and gray squares have become a staple of my morning routine and are a fun way to start the day. I’m not alone in my obsession with the game — nationwide trends on Twitter prove the phenomenon has swept across the country.
The premise is simple: You have six tries to guess one new five-letter word. If a letter is in the word and in the correct spot, it turns green. If the letter is in the word but not in the correct spot, it turns yellow. If the letter is not in the word at all, it turns gray. Once you guess the word, you wait until the next day for a new one. 
Software developer Josh Wardle originally created Wordle as a gift for his partner, not anticipating virality or a profit. Thus, Wordle is free to access, has no ads and can only be accessed on a website, rather than through an app. Further proving his altruistic motives, Wardle actually lost money on Wordle by spending $100 a month to maintain the website. In an interview with Time, Wardle said, “People ask me all the time about the monetization stuff … and I don’t know, maybe I’m an idiot. None of that really appeals to me.”
Despite Wardle’s initial goals, the game quickly became a global phenomenon. In the beginning of November, 90 people played Wordle. By the end of December, the number climbed to 300,000. In January, over 10 million people played. 
In the face of smashing success, Wardle first stuck with his mission to keep the game free and without advertisements, much to my surprise. This past month, however, I received heartbroken texts from my fellow Wordlers (let’s make that name a thing) that Wardle had sold the game to the New York Times for an undisclosed sum in the low seven figures, leading players to assume the game would soon become a much different, and less fun, pay-to-play experience. 
The journey of Wordle from a small, thoughtful gift to a seven-figure sale underscores the cultural urge to monetize. Wardle held off for longer than most, but eventually got overwhelmed by what he’d created. Taking a closer look at Wordle unveils what this desire for profit means nationwide and how that mindset could detrimentally affect nonprofits. 
At first, when Wardle stuck to his guns and refused to turn Wordle into his piggy bank, others inevitably seized at the opportunity. Developer Zach Shakked made a copycat game called “Wordle — the app” which he put on the app store with an optional $30-per-year annual subscription that gave players an unlimited number of puzzles. Shakked bragged about the number of downloads and subscriptions he received, many of whom had likely made their purchase after confusing his copycat game for the original. However, after swift backlash, Apple removed the app from its store.
Public frustration with attempts to monetize the game is rooted in a growing frustration with the emphasis on entrepreneurialism. Why does everything have to become an opportunity to earn cash? When capital is celebrated as the most important resource in society, something purely for entertainment and fun appears meaningless. 
A simple hobby always seems to become a way to earn a living in our profit-driven culture. If a person likes to work out, they’re pressured to make a YouTube channel about it and receive sponsors. If a person likes to knit, they should open an Etsy store to sell clothes. I am even guilty of asking my sister, who is a fantastic artist, when she will open a Redbubble store to sell her work. In a neoliberal society, the constant expectation is that we will market and commodify ourselves. 
However, I can’t blame Wardle for eventually selling Wordle to the New York Times. If he hadn’t capitalized off his game, someone else would have. Additionally, New York Times promised to keep Wordle free “initially” but it’s only a matter of time before Wordle is no longer a form of connection and community but instead a marketing tool played by those willing to pay for it. I’m not upset at Wardle for taking the money, but more disheartened by the general attitude the transaction represents.
When people are always expected to create things that put more money in their pockets, nonprofits become a much less enticing industry. The purchase of Wordle illuminates a culture that revolves around capital, a culture that prioritizes high-paying jobs that are detrimental to society over lower-paying nonprofit jobs that make positive change. For the most success moving forward, we need to shift these narratives and resist the urge to monetize everything. Sometimes things should exist for the simple joy of them existing — without a scheme for profit attached.

Pulling our phones out every single time we want to log into our USC account is annoying, there’s no way around that. While it doesn’t take much time, this daily inconvenience builds each time we have to log into our MyUSC page.  
Gus Anagos, USC’s chief information security officer, explained in a written statement to the Daily Trojan why the university decided to adopt this technology. 
“Think of it as an alarm code in addition to the key to your front door — to better prevent criminals from using your USC email to send malicious emails to other Trojan community members, including those who have access to sensitive data and systems,” Anagos wrote. 
While it is a hassle pressing push every time, it is essential to our digital safety. Our MyUSC accounts are linked to our financial information, medical records, Social Security number, academic information and more. This means that if an individual’s MyUSC account gets compromised, all this information does as well. 
As the world becomes increasingly digitized, it is vital to have a program like Duo to ensure a heightened level of cybersecurity protection. 
In the last few years alone, we’ve seen an enormous shift to digital mediums. The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin signifies a potential shift to digital currency. Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse project aims to create a pocket virtual reality within our present, physical reality. How can anyone forget NFTs? Controversial digital assets many consider a joke or a money-laundering scheme, but they symbolize how much society is moving toward a completely digital world. 
However, there remain many vulnerabilities within the systems as these technologies are still in their infancy. In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission reported that over $4.5 billion was lost due to identity theft and credit card fraud, 45% higher than in 2019. It is not just public entities that are affected. Last year, T-Mobile fell victim to a massive data breach and exposed around 50 million customers’ data including Social Security numbers, credit card information and phone numbers.
This issue is also apparent on a global scale. China has had the upper hand on the United States for quite some time in terms of cyberattacks. Most recently, China became the main suspect of hacking four U.S defense and tech companies, and the National Security Agency blames the vulnerable software these companies use as the reason for the hacks. Even the most powerful aspect of governments and their defense sector are vulnerable to cyberattacks. 
Cyberattacks are affecting countless people, and without the requisite cybersecurity it will only continue to get worse. Companies and nationwide entities need to not only update security measures but also create new ones that are better suited for the digitized future. 
So what does this mean for students? It likely won’t be the only extra layer of cybersecurity measure we will need. It is annoying and can be an inconvenience, but it is an absolute necessity as technologies continue to evolve. If possible, we should try to add extra layers of security for all our vital information. Banking apps in specific have the option for two-layer security verification so do email and social media accounts. We should take advantage of these features to ensure our protection from cyberattacks. 
With our increasingly digitized lifestyle, it is vital to be aware of how much information we carry around on our phones. We need to stay safe and protect ourselves: Duo is just one example of the armor we must equip ourselves with.

When Ally Wei moved into Fluor Tower her freshman year, she had no idea she would be one of the last people to ever live there.
“Fluor Tower was one of those suites that had eight people, so it was a big change compared to living at home,” said Wei, a junior majoring in  media arts and practice. “But I had a really good roommate and I had a ton of friends living across from me. I lived on the eighth floor, so I also had a nice view.”
Her experience, cut short in March 2020 by the coronavirus pandemic, will never be relived; Fluor Tower is scheduled to be demolished after having been left vacant for almost two years.
“Demolition inside the building is scheduled to start in mid-February, and the structure itself will start coming down after commencement in May,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The demolition project will be complete prior to the start of the fall semester in August.”
In its statement, the University gave no specifics as to the reason for the demolition, saying only that it “is part of the university’s capital construction plan.”
In October 2019, a few months before the closure, a fire sprinkler flooded the sixth floor of Fluor Tower and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate.
“People were just really confused,” Wei said about the incident. “Then, all the rumors started about there being water on one of the top floors, and I was like, ‘Oh no, all my stuff is in the dorm, why did I leave without it?’…  We had midterms the next day.”
Thirty two students whose suites sustained extensive damage were relocated to the New North and South Residential Colleges.
Among those students was Jacob Castro, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering.
“They moved our stuff without telling us,” Castro said. “It was a complete mess.”
By the time Fluor Tower was cleared for the remaining students to return, racist rhetoric spread on social media, targeting El Sol y La Luna, a special interest Latinx community whose freshman members lived on the sixth floor where the flooding had originated.
One meme posted on social media included the message, “You can’t make tamales at 3 a.m. and then forget to turn off the microwave.” A since-deleted Change.org petition called for the eviction of the residents, according to reporting by FOX11. The petition’s title included the room number of the suite that flooded and the description read that it “had become clear … that there are enemies among us.”
“Coming from a community that’s mainly Latinos, [the comments were] not something I was not used to,” Castro said.
The incident was reported on by a writer from FOX11 who visited Fluor Tower and interviewed some of the residents. FOX11 also tracked down the individual who started the petition for an interview. While their identity was not revealed in the video segment uploaded the next day, Castro said he recognized them.
“We all know who it was; we could tell from what they were wearing,” Castro said. “And to my knowledge, [they] didn’t get punished whatsoever.”
“It just felt like [the University was] definitely not on our side,” Castro said.
Ernesto Ortiz Zamora, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said the University’s response to the incident was inadequate.
“There’s a certain aspect of being a minority; when you feel othered, or attacked, in what you thought was a safe space,” Zamora said. “It reveals a lot about the character or the agenda of where you seek to call home. We saw that there was probably an insufficient response from the University.”
Despite the incident, former residents said they remember their experience at the Latinx Floor fondly.
Selene Castillo, a junior majoring in international relations and Spanish, said the community made her “experience at USC so much better.”
“Coming into USC was definitely an intimidating experience,” Castillo said. “But living on the floor with people that looked like me, with people that shared similar experiences, definitely made [the] transition into college easier.”
Castro was one of only a few people from his area to attend USC. 
“I didn’t really know anyone coming,” Castro said. “Being accepted and living [at the Latinx floor], I was greeted by pretty much lifelong friends — they’re my ride-or-dies.”
Zamora, who was also a student worker at Fluor Tower, recalled the building as having “a vibrant community,” and said the news of the demolition was “bittersweet.” He had hoped to return to work at Fluor his junior year to relive his “incomplete first-year experience,” only to discover that the building would never open its doors again. 
“Fluor Tower has provided me with a lot of highs and lows, and, for that reason, I can’t remember it for being anything but memorable,” Zamora said.
The University said that while there is no determined plan as to the “ultimate use” of the space after the demolition, it “is considering options for a new structure in that location.” 
The Latinx Floor for freshmen is now located in Pardee Tower. Sophomore members reside in Century Apartments.
