Student Affairs said it wants to make sure new members of the Greek community have a residential experience next academic year, as the university plans to have all freshman and sophomore students live in residential housing with residential advisers.

Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, said the university is still working to make sure Greek organizations don’t schedule chapter programs on Tuesdays so that the residential advisers will have a day where all Greek students would be available, though sororities and fraternities have been required to do this since the beginning of the semester.
“We want to have at least one night that can be used by the resident faculty and professional and student staff to conduct programs without worrying about students having to participate in mandatory programs in chapter houses,” Jackson said in an email.
Interfraternity Council President Pat Lauer said not having social events on Tuesdays this semester has helped integrate the freshman and sophomore members of the Greek community so they can contribute to other campus activities more effectively.
“[Not having events on Tuesday] is the norm now and it’s a good thing,” Lauer said. “It’s given the younger guys a chance to branch out and do things they normally wouldn’t have done and participate in campus activities they normally wouldn’t have participated in.”
Despite beginning the semester with a social probation, the Greek community has grown stronger in several other ways, Jackson said. The Greek community has focused on new member education as most fraternity and sorority chapters have had 100 percent of their new members complete GreekLifeEdu, an online course for the Greek community similar to AlcoholEdu, according to Jackson.
“We have made sound progress,” Jackson said. “It is important to remember that working with the Greek community is always a work in progress as almost 25 percent of the membership turns over each year, so leadership development, transition of leadership from one set of leaders to another and new member education are incredibly important to all chapters and systems.”
Lauer said IFC and Panhellenic Council will continue to work to improve the Greek community by focusing on its new members.
“We realized that if we want to effect change we have to start from the ground up,” Lauer said. “That’s why we focused a lot of programming with the new members, the freshmen and the sophomores, who will carry on our legacies. There has been a huge focus to foster more activities so we contribute more constructively with the university.”
Jackson said the new member retreat, held in September, will be offered to those in the Multicultural Greek Council and National Panhellenic Council chapters next year and that there are also plans to develop an assessment tool to better understand the overall experience of students in Greek organizations. The retreat was created in response to the social prohibition, because it was implemented after negative events concerning the image of the Greek community.
Student Affairs and Greek organizations both said the changes to the Greek community rely on continuous communication and support.
“Groups know that their destiny is, for the most part, in their hands,” Jackson said in an email. “The systems and chapters have the ability to set standards of behavior and hold members accountable, The university wants strong groups that provide thoughtful and caring educational, personal and professional development experiences and encourage members to take advantage of the vast array of resources at USC.“
Why would greek students want the same “residential experience” that GDI’s have…..that’s lame.
Amen Bro!
You know it’s true!
According to what I have read, SAE has the strongest new member practices on the row.
“as the university plans to have all freshman and sophomore students live in residential housing with residential advisers”…. how does this school just keep coming up with new ridiculous rules ruining student’s freedom and fun. Give it a rest. We’re all doing fine.

As part of World AIDS day today, ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives, acquired last year by USC, is launching a campaign to encourage people who have lost loved ones to AIDS to come forward and give testimonies as well as donate victims’ personal records, including diaries and medical histories.
ONE National Archives is the oldest LGBT organization in the United States and has the largest repository of LGBT material in the world. USC Libraries acquired the organization’s archives last year and has maintained them since.
Christopher Freeman, a professor of English and gender studies and a member of the board of ONE National Inc., said the campaign aims to make its archives more personal.
“The archives are the most detailed source of information on the history and cultural evolution of homosexuality in the United States,” Freeman said. “But they lacked the personal stories of members of the community who suffered and died because of AIDS, as well as the stories of their loved ones who survived them.”
The campaign kickoff event, which will be held at the ONE National Inc. office on Adams Boulevard and Portland Street today, will feature testimonies and talks from long-term survivors, activists, writers and physicians. Dr. Michael Gottlieb, who made the first diagnosis of AIDS in June 1981 at UCLA, will also speak at the event.
“The event will be an opportunity for the people who got left behind to remember the victims and perpetuate their stories,” Freeman said.
In addition to ONE National’s archive, USC Libraries houses a varied collection of other historic documents and archives readily available to students and faculty.
One of the largest digitalized collections is the Regional History Collection, a collection of historic newspapers, the oldest of which is an 1808 edition of the Columbia Centinel, a Boston newspaper. The USC Digital Library also includes a collection of digitized photos published in the historical Los Angeles Examiner newspaper from 1920-1961.
“This collection is of tremendous research value across many disciplines,” said Hugh McHarg, USC Libraries associate dean for planning and communications. “The Examiner collection, accessible globally through the Digital Library, provides invaluable perspectives on Los Angeles politics, culture, crime and entertainment from that era.”
USC Libraries has an original copy of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War and established the boundaries between Mexico and California. The USC Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive also contains nearly 52,000 videotaped interviews with witnesses to the Holocaust that were gathered by the Shoah Foundation between 1994 and 2005.
Claude Zachary, the university archivist and manuscripts librarian, said students from a variety of departments use these collections.
“We get a lot of students from history, policy, planning and development, fine arts and many other departments,” Zachary said. “We provide access through a reading room in our Special Collections department in Doheny Library.”
Elise Tasooji, a senior majoring in communication, recently used the archives for a class project and said she was very impressed by their detail and depth.
“I was working on a movie about the Los Angeles freeway system and needed photos for the historical aspect of the film,” Tasooji said. “The Dick Whittington collection had a large number of aerial photos of the freeways as well as photos of their early construction.”
Tasooji also said the libraries’ staff members were very helpful and prompt when she contacted them.
“I emailed the curator of the archives describing my project and she got back to me with a list of archive material that she thought would be relevant to the movie and I just picked out what I wanted,” Tasooji said.
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Dr. Robert Gallo, the researcher who originally discovered HIV, was invited to speak at the event. The speaker was Dr. Michael Gottlieb.

Members of the National Union Healthcare Workers, nurses of the California Nurses Association and employees of the Keck Medical Center of USC protested USC administration’s lack of contractual negotiations at a candlelight vigil for patient care Wednesday night outside the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
Tension between the administration and caregivers began in August 2010, when employees asked management to stop short-staffing because of its negative affect on the hospital, according to an NUHW press release. Caregivers took further action when contractual changes were not made.
NUHW hosted a strike Oct. 12 protesting the administration for limited employee benefits and a proposed one-year wage freeze, said Leighton Woodhouse, director of communications for NUHW.
Alex Corea, a respiratory therapist at Keck Medical Center of USC and member of NUHW, said the candlelight vigil is meant to send a different message to the administration than the October strike.
“After the strike, which was pretty chaotic, we’re trying to tell the management that we are willing to talk in a peaceful manner,” Corea said. “Everybody is trying to keep the faith.”
USC administration responded to the one-day protest by suspending “four workers for frivolous reasons related to their participation and organizing around the Unfair Labor Practice strike,” according to an NUHW press release.
Registered nurses of the CNA joined NUHW’s cause when the hospital administration reneged on a previous agreement to provide family tuition assistance benefits and retirement plans.
NUHW filed charges of unfair conduct against the Keck Medical Center of USC in October, which the National Labor Board supported by issuing further complaints. The hearing began on Oct. 24 and the trial is still ongoing.
“Essentially, they will have to undo what they have done; if employees have been wronged, they must be made whole,” John Borsos, vice president of NUHW, told the Daily Trojan in October. “They must let employees know that they had acted in bad faith and they will have to compensate people for anything they have lost.”
Update: In response to the candlelight vigil and allegations from the NUHW, the Keck Hospital of USC issued the following statement: “From the start we have bargained in good faith,” Keck Hospital CEO Mitch Creem said in a press release. “We believe the proposals we have made to the National Union of Healthcare Workers are more than fair. We strongly deny the allegations that the union has made.”

The USC men’s and women’s swim and dive teams will head to the Lone Star state this weekend to participate in the Texas Invitational in what will serve as the first major out-of-state competition of the season.
“The Texas Invitational is the most important competition for the fall,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “Our focus is to race to times that will first qualify all of our relays for the NCAA championships in March.”
Both teams are off to good starts this season, posting solid showings in meets against Cal State Bakersfield, Arizona, Arizona State and at the USC Diving Invite. Neither squad has had a meet since Nov. 12, but Salo is not expecting any sort of letdown or rust to hinder both team’s performance.
“[We’ve] been training well and we have avoided any health or injury setbacks this fall so we are looking to be very competitive,” Salo said. “Our athletes are pretty excited to get down to Texas and race.”
Seniors Katinka Hosszu and Amanda Smith look to lead the Women of Troy and continue their great starts in their last seasons in cardinal and gold. At its last meet against Arizona State, USC won by a score of 198-99. Senior diver Victoria Ishimatsu looks to continue her stellar season in Texas, as well.
On the men’s side, sophomore Vladimir Morozov and freshman Chad Bobrosky look to lead the Trojans in freestyle events. Other than a loss to Arizona, USC holds an unblemished record. The Trojans currently trail Arizona, Stanford and California in the national rankings.
Salo said this is an important event for the teams because it will provide a good chance for the relay teams to receive automatic bids to the NCAA championships. Salo also said he wants his teams to record good times to become eligible for the championships.
“[Our other goal] will be for all our athletes to record their personal best times with an eye on the ‘A’ and ‘B’ qualifying time standards,” Salo explained. “While swimmers who get “A” times automatically make the championships, only the top 24 to 30 swimmers with “B” times make it to the championships.”
UCLA, Wisconsin, Texas A&M, Texas and Arizona will also participate in the Texas Invitational. Salo said there will be extra motivation to beat the Wildcats, as they are the only blemish on the men’s and schedule.
“We want to avenge our early season loss to Arizona,” Salo said.

With redshirt sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon sidelined for the first time this season with a stress fracture in his right foot, the USC men’s basketball team needed other players to assume the scoring load.
Stepping up · Freshman guard Alexis Moore was one of two Trojans in double figures to help USC defeat UC Riverside 56-35. USC shot 53 percent from the field and limited the Highlanders to just 11 points in the second half. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (4-4) spread the ball around, as all seven Trojans who received playing time scored four or more points in the 56-35 victory over UC Riverside on Wednesday at the UC Riverside Student Recreation Center — the largest margin of victory and first two-game winning streak of the season for USC.
The Highlanders (2-5) opened the game leading 10-2, much to the delight of the sold-out crowd at the Student Recreation Center who witnessed USC’s first-ever road trip to Riverside.
The Trojans closed the opening half on an 8-2 run to go into halftime leading 32-24, and then carried the momentum into the second half, scoring 21 of the first 27 points.
USC held the Highlanders to 11 points in the second half. The Trojans shot .532 from the field, compared to .351 for UC Riverside. USC shot .500 or better for the fourth consecutive game.
Junior guard Greg Allen paced the Trojans with 11 points, including three baskets from beyond the arc.
After he was held scoreless in his previous three games, freshman guard Alexis Moore had 10 points.
Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson scored eight points, all in the first half.
Freshman guard Byron Wesley added eight points, his third consecutive game with eight or more points.
Coming off a 28-point outburst in the win over South Carolina on Saturday that helped sophomore guard Maurice Jones earn the Pac-12 Player of the Week award, was held to six points, and missed all five of his three-point attempts.
Two players, senior guard Phil Martin and senior guard Kareem Nitoto, combined to score 24 of UC Riverside’s 35 total points.
The Trojans will next travel to Minnesota, their farthest road trip of the season. The Gophers (6-1) won their first six games of the season, but leading scorer and rebounder Trevor Mbakwe, a senior forward, tore his ACL on Sunday against Dayton, and is expected to miss the rest of the season. With Mbakwe out, sophomore guard Austin Hollins averages a team-high 10.3 points per game, and no other player averages more than 3.7 points per game. The game can be seen on Saturday at 11:15 a.m. on the Big Ten Network.
USC returns to Galen Center to play New Mexico on Dec. 10, beginning a stretch of four-straight home games that also includes games against Georgia and TCU, and culminates with a match-up against 15th-ranked Kansas on Dec. 22. Last year, the Trojans had possession of the ball trailing 70-68 to the Jayhawks, but guard Jio Fontan stepped out of bounds and Kansas held on for the victory.
The Trojans open Pac-12 competition on Dec. 29 at California. Dedmon, who is expected to miss four to six weeks, has said he hopes to return in time for conference games.

USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley will no doubt have plenty of people in his ear over the next several weeks until the deadline to declare for the 2012 NFL draft comes in early January.
Go for the money, they’ll say. Stay for the pride. Go to fulfill your dream of playing at the highest level. Stay to fulfill your dream of winning a Heisman.
He’s heard it all before, and he’s thought about it all too. Ultimately, only he can decide what is best for him and those close to him.
And if USC coach Lane Kiffin, Athletic Director Pat Haden, his teammates, his coaches, his friends and his fans are close to him, Barkley will realize that not only should he stay but that it’s his burden to come back for a fourth year.
The USC football program currently rests in a precarious position, and whether it falls onto the side of perennial championship contention or the side of middling success for the next few years probably largely depends on what is likely one of the most important decisions Barkley has ever made in his entire life.
Barkley owes it to the program to finish the job of restoring it to greatness for all USC has done to foster Barkley’s growth.
One might wonder why an unpaid athlete that generates millions of dollars for the university without appreciable financial return owes anything to that university. One might wonder why this same athlete would owe anything to a football program that was not allowed to play for a national championship (and, effectively, a Heisman trophy or even a Rose Bowl title).
But how often does a true freshman quarterback have the chance to start for a team ranked in the top-five in the preseason polls? How many quarterbacks have the kind of recruiting talent behind them to bring in two of the nation’s best receivers (sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee) in consecutive years sullied by sanctions — with another pair of receiver recruits from those two years (redshirt freshman Kyle Prater and freshman George Farmer) still awaiting playing time?
Barkley committed to a university that carries the prestige and credibility necessary to provide all of that for him. Barkley attends a university with enough national recognition stowed away from its decade of immense success that it could get him the face time he needed to become the prospect he is today.
Simply put, USC has enabled Barkley’s development in a way that almost no other program could hope to. Barkley realized his uniquely favorable position when he heard about the sanctions, and that’s why he decided to stay. That’s why he made an investment to a hopeless program.
He saw what he could do for himself and the team. He saw the long-term hope for his career, and he saw the long-term hope for the program.
When he envisioned that hope for the team about a year-and-a-half ago, you can bet he saw himself as a part of it. The distractions that have arisen since then would be hard to ignore for anyone, much less a wide-eyed 20-year-old on the brink of emerging to the elite level.
No one could blame Barkley for succumbing to those distractions. Some might sigh, pout or even have some choice words for Barkley if they ever ran into him, but if they’d think about putting themselves in his position, they’d be able to relate.
Kiffin acted quickly in his press conference after the season finale against UCLA to curb expectations for Barkley’s return, suggesting it would take the resolve and will of a “special Trojan” for Barkley to return for his senior season.
It’s not likely Kiffin is as pessimistic about the situation in private, and he probably hasn’t made his final stand in attempting to persuade Barkley himself.
But let’s assume Kiffin is right. Let’s assume Barkley would have to go above and beyond and do something special for the football program.
If Barkley realized just how unique his situation at USC has been … If he took note of each and every decision USC made over the last three seasons to make things great for him … If he understood just how talented he already is, he’d be back at practice in the spring. And it would probably be difficult to grasp why it was even a hard decision to make in the first place.
The burden is on Barkley to make sure everything USC has done for him doesn’t go unanswered. And all it takes is a year.

USC IS NOW NUMBER FIVE IN THE COUNTRY WHICH PLACES YOU ON A PATH TO A LIKELY NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, A HEISMAN TROPHY FOR YOU AND THE GREAT MEMORIES YOU WILL HAVE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.  WE MUST NOT FORGET RECEIVING A DEGREE FROM AN EXCELLENT UNIVERSITY WHICH I KNOW IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, AS IT SHOULD BE!   I KNOW THAT THESE THOUGHTS ARE RINGING TRUE TO YOUR HEART MATT. I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL BECOME THE GREATEST TROJAN OF ALL  TIME IF YOU STAY THIS LAST YEAR!
i hope Matt doesn’t read this article. did you think that those players came to usc maybe because they would have matt throwing to them? did matt participate in recruiting those players? I am a trojan through and through, but what the….?
You are a dumbass.  Matt stuck with USC when everybody else would have left to better situations.  He owes nothing to this university, and you, should stop writing and find a new major at sc.
REDICULOUS! LUDICROUS! and just plain selfish on the part of this author/writer and IF this is the true feelings of USC. Articles like this are the very reason I am no longer a Trojan fan even though I grew up with them and my whole family bleeds maroon and gold! Barkley, whatever you decide, GODSPEED!
This article is offensive and dangerous.  To think that someone took the time to write this is offensive to all people that are productive in their day to day ventures as you sir wasted a whole bunch of time writing this article.  Good luck trying to become the next Skip Bayless.  Mr. Barkley does not need advice from you.
I love me some Matt Barkley. I think the world of the kid. I’m proud of his accomplishments in the classroom and on the field. 
Dude’s on pace to get his degree BEFORE fall semester (i.e., he doesn’t need to stay for his senior year to get his degree). He’s been a fantastic ambassador for the AD and — when sanctions were imposed — the university. He’s a true Trojan and I support him regardless of whatever he decides.
Matt doesn’t owe SC anything. It’s been a mutually beneficial relationship. To that end, IMO the article’s premise is in poor taste.
Fight On Matthew!
Get a clue! USC gave Barkley a first-rate education, he gave them 3 great years. He has a chance to start in the NFL next season, and make more money than most people see in their lifetimes. One helmet to the knee could ruin all that.  One sack by a 300lb d-lineman could end his career forever. He’s gone, like LaMichael James at Oregon and many other top junior prospects. Get over it and move on.
This may be the single dumbest article I’ve read all year, regardless of subject. If I was Matt Barkley this type of attitude would make me leave and not think twice about it.
We OWE Barkley – he stuck with us through the NCAA sanctions, he doesn’t owe anyone, anything.
Barkley stuck around when the NCAA said no bowl, reduced scholarships, and players could transfer without the 1 year penalty.  It would be awesome if he stayed one more year but he owes us nothing.  We are indebted to him.
I am sorry, but Matt doens’t owe anything to ‘SC.  Quite the opposite, the school should thank him for being such a class act!  Don’t get me wrong, I would love to have him back next year!  In fact, as a Cardinal and Gold, I am praying and hoping that he comes back.  He is a fantastic young man!  He did a fine job as the “face” of the program.  The only argument (which I think is important) would be to come back to finish his degree.  I just think that the degree is so important!  But I do know that, perhaps, it doesn’t compare to the millions waiting for him.  But at the end of the day, money does come and go!
After the character, leadership, and talent Barkley displayed over the past three years he doesn’t owe anyone anything. He became the face of the program during one of the most critical periods of it’s history. He became the glue that not only held this team together but also built a foundation of TEAM that will take it into it’s future. My first SC game was in1969 and the teamwork and unselfishness of this team has made it my most favorite. Thanks Matt for being an amazing example at such a young age. I’d love it if you came back but also know you have to go after what’s in your heart, whatever that may be.
replace difficult mountain with “majestic mountain”  thanks r. fawell

I disagree with the premise of this article, but Matt–if you’re reading–stay for the fun of it!  Life doesn’t get any better then what you’re experiencing.
Matt you have exhibited tremendous strength of character by showing your loyalty to the Trojan family in difficult times.  The best analogy is one of climbing a dificult mountain of which you have still not reached the summit.  The summit is less than a few hundred meters away– meaning a possible National Championship, the Heisman Trophy,   providing much needed ongoing strength  for the football program at USC and a degree from a prestigious university.  Your decision to stay places spiritual values above material ones and will always be held in the highest eteem by all.  Fight on for old SC.
I just hope he asks his understudy if he should stay?
Barkley was on Jimmy Kimmel last night.
Once we start telling him that he has to stay, he’s not going to stay. Just take it easy… 
He owes USC nothing.
Lucky for us, at this point, it seems like he’s going to stay.
“Precarious position?” Hardly. How many starters are returning? “Hopeless program?” That’s a laugh. SC perennially has top-recruiting classes.  Let’s see how much loyalty Danny Savitzky shows to the Daily Trojan when the Daily Breeze comes calling with a contract offer. So just because the DT gave him a column and a chance to perfect his hyperbole (which he obviously hasn’t done yet), he should reject a professional offer? College prepares one for a career. Only Barkley can decide when it’s the right time to move on.
Like most of the other comments, I disagree with this article. Matt has given more than he has received and no matter what he decides we should all be happy for him. Of course, we want him to return and take advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will create memories to last his entire life (and ours). I think it is unfortunately that so many people are bugging him about staying. It is his decision alone and he knows how USC fans feel about him.
STAY MATT & GRADUATE. THE PROS WILL BE THERE FOR YOU.
Barkley owes USC absolutely anything. If anything, we owe him.
nothing*
Barkley owes nothing to USC, but USC owes Barkley. He had every opportunity to go to a different university but he stayed because he wanted to be a Trojan, a dream he had as a child. 
As a USC fan, I would love for him to stay but it is misguided to claim he has a debt to pay. Also, you make many claims about what he thinks, thought or felt without backing any of it up. It’s poor journalism.
I disagree with you on two counts – Barkley doesn’t owe USC anything. He has been fantastic these past few years when he could have easily been average and blamed everything on the sanctions. He made himself a better quarterback so USC could have success.
That being said, whether or not Barkley stays, I seriously doubt USC will be limited to “middling success.” Obviously, nobody’s seen much of our backup quarterbacks, but they are all supposed to be good. Woods and Lee are dynamic enough players to make catches that might not be completely on target. The defense is rapidly improving. 
Will we experience growing pains next year if Barkley leaves? Sure. But I have no doubt that the team can play at a high level.
I disagree; Barkley doesn’t owe USC anything.  If anything, we owe him.  We owe him our support and encouragement no matter what he decides.  Barkley stuck with USC through sanctions, through coaching changes, and through what could have been the darkest time in USC football history.  But Barkley has lead his team and his team-mates from the edge of disaster to a top 10 finish.  This is not meant to minimize the job that everyone else has done, especially Kiffin, but Barkley has played what is probably the most important role of all.
Barkley, we support you no matter what!
+1
As a huge fan of the Trojans, I have to disagree with you . Barkley does not owe USC anything, he has brought us back from mediocrity to top ten. Along the way his leadership allowed the younger players to thrive, show me one other QB that could have produced two freshman phenoms at wide reciever . 
I think his greatest attribute to the trojans is his humble nature and being a christian that has a positive influence on every one around him.
If he does come back and play like he did in the final games… He will cement his legacy as the greatest QB in Trojan history.
But he will also earn a degree and I think he would really really enjoy that final year . Those are much better reasons for him to come back for a final year.
He will graduate next semester.
Great article. What Barkley needs to consider too is that once he gets to the NFL he can be traded, dropped, and abused. NFL players are commodities, NCAA players are family. The one year he’d spend gunning for a national title would most likely be the best year of his life. The money will come. REGARDLESS of what he does next season he will be drafted high. The money will be there. This opportunity of a senior year is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Please stay and cement yourself as USC’s greatest quarterback, Heisman winner, and number 1 overall draft pick. It’s what you deserve and it’s what USC deserves.
“Traded, dropped, and abused”? Really? He’ll be a franchise QB for the next 10 years for somebody. There’s no guarantee he’ll win a Heisman next year, no way. What if he comes back next season and suffers a career ending injury? There goes that money that “will come”. He doesn’t owe USC anything and has proven all he needs to in college.
Big football programs like USC are the unofficial training camps for the NFL.  If the analysts strongly believe he will be a first round draft pick, he should go for it while he is still healthy.  That is why he chose USC, right?  Nonsense about completing a degree is for college students, not professional athletes in training.  Barkley has already made up his mind to leave, so get over it.
Go while your stock is up. IPOs are putative for being overpriced, and thereafter, reality, disillusionement settles in, and the price spirals downward. First year quarterbacks don’t do so hot with the exception of Cam Newton. The NFL is cutthroat, and the average NFL player’s career is no more than 4 years. Imagine the millions of $ you’re passing up if you opt to stay your senior year. Sure, the college experience is invaluable, but millions of $ in the NFL is worth far more…
“financially” as Barkley put it on ESPN last night.
Very well written article…I hope Matt stays to finish out his 4 years at USC then he can tell his children that he graduated from USC and spent 4 great years playing football for the Trojans!  Don’t let the money sway your decision..remember your Trojan pride and graduate with your class of 2013.
[…] through sanctions, through coaching changes, and through what could have been the darkest time in Usc Football History. But Barkley has lead his team and his team-mates from the edge of disaster to a top 10 finish. […]

It’s almost become a familiar story.
For the 21st consecutive season, the No. 1 USC women’s volleyball team will be playing in the NCAA tournament.
Now, however, the team hopes to capture its first national title since 2003.
The Women of Troy (25-4, 20-2) finished the season winning 20 of their last 21 matches, but drew the No. 7 seed in the tournament and will host the Yale Bulldogs (18-6, 12-2), who were Ivy League champions.
Falling in place · Despite the ineligibility of outside hitter Falyn Fonoimoana, senior setter Kendall Bateman (right) and the Women of Troy have amassed 25 wins and a No. 1 ranking. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
USC’s core of seniors — outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams — was a key reason for USC’s success.
Last week, Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott announced a bevy of awards in which many of USC’s players were recognized: Jupiter won Pac-12 Player of the Year and earned All-Pac-12 honors, and the native of France became just the third player in USC history to earn conference player of the year honors.
Jupiter continues to be a lethal force on the offensive end, finishing third in the Pac-12 averaging four kills per set. After capping off the regular season with a 18-kill, five-dig performance against UCLA, Jupiter ended the year as USC’s all-time leader in kills (1,822) and points (2,142).
Bateman and Williams also earned All-Pac-12 Conference honors. Bateman became USC’s all-time assists leader against UCLA, and she now has 4,264 career assists. Junior outside hitter Katie Fuller earned conference honorable mention.
The Women of Troy’s underclassmen also played an integral role as sophomore libero Natalie Hagglund was named Pac-12 Libero of the Year and freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer received Pac-12 All-Freshman honorable mention. Meanwhile, USC coach Mick Haley was nominated Pac-12 Coach of the Year for guiding the team to its 11th straight postseason appearance under his watch.
Yale, making its third NCAA appearance in program history, is led by outside hitters Mollie Rogers and Allie Frappier, who have 536 kills and 520 digs combined.
The Bulldogs finished the season winning 12 of their last 14 matches and won their second straight Ivy League title, making it their third in four years.
“They have five girls from San Diego so that makes for a very interesting situation,” Haley said.  “Yale is very worthy to be in the tournament and we need to be ready to play against them on Friday.”
If the Women of Troy advance past Yale, they will host the winner of Tulsa-Oklahoma in the second round.
Tulsa, the reigning Conference USA champions, finished the year 27-6, winning 14 of its last 15 matches. The Golden Hurricanes compiled an 18-2 record under coach Steven McRoberts, who is in his first year at the helm. Tulsa is led by outside hitter Tyler Henderson with 553 kills, ranking seventh nationally, and 582.5 points. Outside hitter Diana Silva notched 336 kills and 359 digs on the year.
The Sooners played the Women of Troy in the 2009 NCAA tournament, as USC swept Oklahoma in its first-round matchup.
Oklahoma relies on senior Suzy Boulavsky, who leads the Sooners with 397 kills and 93 blocks. Senior setter Brianne Barker, who has 125 kills and 1,186 assists this season.
Despite high hopes and expectations from an experienced group of players, the Women of Troy are keeping an even-keeled approach, and not overlooking any opponent.
First serve is at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

The chase for history runs its course in Berkeley, Calif.
Young gun · Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic has netted 36 goals this season — second best on USC. As a freshman in 2010, Vavic helped the Trojans notch their third straight NCAA title. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 USC men’s water polo has been thinking about this weekend — the weekend of the NCAA tournament at California’s Spieker Aquatic Center — for the past three months.
The Trojans (22-3, 8-0) head into the competition as the top seed in the tournament with the same goal in mind. If it wins the tournament this weekend, the Trojan squad will become the first to ever earn a four-peat.
“We are looking forward to another trip to Berkeley,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “It’s been on our minds all year long that we would make history.”
No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 UC San Diego and No. 4 Princeton comprise the rest of the field. USC will play its first game against the Tigers (21-9) on Saturday at 1 p.m. while UCLA (23-4, 6-2) and UC San Diego (17-9) face off two hours later. The next day the championship game will be at 3 p.m., and the third-place game at 1 p.m.
The Trojans’ 13-game winning streak was snapped by UCLA, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, in last weekend’s Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
But as USC is on the cusp of history, it insists it’s not distracted. Not now, not ever. Despite losing in the final round, it still received the at-large bid and top seeding at NCAAs.
“This team, whenever we needed to win games this season, when it was a must-win, we won it,” Vavic said. “That’s why we are No. 1.”
The MPSF also recognized the continual dominance that USC brought to the water polo world Tuesday, honoring five Trojans with awards. Senior goalie Joel Dennerley became the first ever back-to-back conference player of the year and was placed on the 2011 All-MPSF first team.
Three other Trojans joined Dennerley on the First Team: senior driver Peter Kurzeka, sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic, the most all-conference first-teamers in USC history. Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias added to the count of those recognized with his 2011 MPSF Honorable Mention.
“The backbone of our team is Dennerley, Kurzeka, Davie and [Nikola] Vavic,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “They have to play well — they are our key players.”
The Trojans entered this season with the No. 1 ranking, and after a brief stint as No. 2, made their way back to the top of the charts. Even with the water polo world fully aware of USC’s mission toward a 4-peat, and each team determined to stop the Trojans, USC heads into the NCAA tournament understanding its potential.
“We knew all year long that we are the team to beat,” Jovan Vavic said. “We have been dealing with pressure well before the season.”
That pressure, however, has not stopped the Trojan offense from averaging 11.6 goals per game, or the defense from holding its opponents to a mere 5.5 goals per game. One of the Trojans’ biggest strengths has been diversity — nearly every offensive player has contributed at least once this season.
The Trojans have worked hard this season, all with the goal of winning a fourth-consecutive NCAA title in the back of their thoughts. In two short days, they will have the chance to make their dreams a reality.

Could Nintendo’s timing be any worse? Finals are a mere week away, and the superpower gaming company just released The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. And honestly, if you start playing the game now, you can say so long to your 4.0.
But that’s because Skyward Sword might just be the best game in the series since 1998’s Ocarina of Time.
Nintendo’s niche · Legendary gamemakers Nintendo add to their prestigious legacy with the latest installment of the Legend of Zelda series, showcasing extraordinary art and characterization. - Photo courtesy of Nintendo
Bold claim? Yes. But what else can be said of the fastest-selling Zelda game of all time?
Once you take into account the cinematic graphics, the impressively developed characters and the timeless plot, you’ll be whisked away right into the major motion picture epic that has never been, but should be.
Skyward Sword tells the story before the story of Zelda. Players are transported to the time predating the Ocarina. Link and Zelda are childhood friends who have grown up on Skyloft, a floating city separated from “The Surface,” which is inhabited by monsters and evil spirits. When Zelda is kidnapped to the world beneath, Link must set out on a quest to recover his lost friend.
The Zelda series has a history of weaving elaborate story lines in and out of engrossing game play — but for the love of Zora, have the developers taken things to a whole new level. The opening sequence is, in and of itself, a masterfully crafted prologue. It’s a visually striking delight of design.
And the game play is so artfully manipulated that you feel as if you’re directing a movie, unfolding the plot with your commands. The line between what the gamer controls and what is programmed blurs as options for what to say, what to do, where to go and who to be diversify the gaming experience with incredible variance.
Plus, with Wii MotionPlus built into the controller, being a part of the action has never seemed more real and enticing. Unlike Twilight Princess’ attempt at motion-centered gaming, Skyward Sword lives up to the promise: The sword fighting is much more involved.
You actually have to lunge to make a spearing motion. The angle of your swing determines how you strike. You’ll be jumping, chopping, spinning, throwing, leaping and lifting your blade to the sky, all with the remote.
Along with the new action capabilities, Link can also engage in other exciting activities: flying atop giant birds, skydiving, probing for auras and so much more.
But one of Skyward Sword’s most impressive elements is its character development. Though watching Zelda and Link share romantic moments might not be the most exciting aspect of the game, the characterization in this game gives the plot and game play depth. Everyone is unique and memorable, and even the townspeople are quirky as ever, à la Zelda games of the past.
And Zelda has never before been so colorfully animated. She exudes a radiance and poise beyond her years that makes the task of finding her even more personal and enthralling. As per usual, Link’s lack of voiceover makes it feel as if it’s really you embodying the hero of the land.
As an added bonus, each game from the first run of publishing comes with a glorious album featuring the 25th Anniversary Legend of Zelda Symphony that passed through Los Angeles a few weeks ago. The symphonic movements reinvigorate 8-bit classics such as the main theme and the “Great Fountain Fairy’s Song” with vibrant, sweeping beauty.
It’s a fitting companion to the music in the game, which has been invigorated with real instruments and high quality recordings. The soundscapes are as variant and complex as the landscapes. From Skyloft to Lake Floria, the score completes the immersive experience and sets the perfect tone on every level.
Skyward Sword culminates in a breathtaking experience that seamlessly combines action, adventure, story and interface to create an astounding epic worthy of everyone’s time.
Just don’t break the seal until finals are over.

When you finish that last final, the feeling is almost indescribable. Suddenly you’ve got more than enough hours to plan out your day the way you want, with no class schedules or impending deadlines standing in your way.
If you’ll be staying in Los Angeles for winter break, spice up your stay by exploring the artsy-er side of the city. There are enough events and exhibitions to give your break an interesting spin. Whether it’s at a gallery or outdoors at an iconic location, Downtown Los Angeles has plenty to keep you busy and maybe even get you inspired.
Take, for example, the Watts Towers, an impressive collection of 17 spires, some of which soar more than 90 feet high. Simon Rodia built the towers by hand from 1921 to 1954. The towers are mostly made of steel but also include other materials, such as porcelain. As part of the current Pacific Standard Time initiative, which involves many galleries and museums, there will be an opening reception Dec. 17 at 1 p.m. for the exhibition “Civic Virtue: The Impact of the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery and the Watts Towers Art Center.”
The exhibition will focus on these locations and how they came to be. The opening reception will feature the jazz act Nedra Wheeler Trio and will include a screening of I Build the Tower, a documentary about Rodia’s life.
If that visit gets you feeling crafty and ready to learn more about how to make your own masterpiece, the Getty Villa might be able to get you started. Learn more about glassmaking at the Villa by attending a handling session on a Thursday, Saturday or Sunday starting today. You can hold and look closely at everything from a flask to a glass bowl while learning more about the creation processes. The tools behind the magic and the secrets behind the ingredients that go into successful glassmaking are also at hand. The session is free with your ticket to the Getty Villa — just make sure to get that ticket in advance.
If you want something a little more modern and kooky, make sure you head to the Hive Gallery. Saturday marks opening night for the upcoming show, entitled “The Opening Show,” and for $8 you can enjoy everything from burlesque performances to tarot readings from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. “Price…less” features art you can purchase  for less than $250 with artworks from resident artists and new talents.
Expect anything from Michelle Romo’s cutesy creatures to Daniaelle Simonsen’s sewn installation art. With more than 60 artists and performances every hour, the opening night is bound to stay interesting, especially as you weave your way through the gallery’s many rooms. If you can’t make it to opening night, the exhibition will be open until Dec. 31.
It might be located in enemy territory, but Westwood’s Hammer Museum also has a few events worth checking out. Among them is a screening of videos by Kara Walker, an artist bold in her subject matter and medium.
Walker works with paper, cutting silhouettes that she then pastes onto the wall. The figures and stories she creates address issues such as gender and race and have garnered her much acclaim. Walker’s videos will be shown at the Hammer on Dec. 11. The screening will feature three new works, and at 2 p.m. Walker will converse with Hilton Als, a prominent theater critic. Walker has toured everywhere from Johannesburg to Chicago — so now is your chance not only to experience her works but also hear from the artist herself.
Whether you head to West Los Angeles or stay in Downtown, the upcoming month is teeming with upcoming art events that can make your winter break, and the days leading up to it, all the more memorable. The city is constantly abuzz with some new art event or another, and you might as well take advantage of them when you can.

Priscilla Ahn
What better way to end the semester than with a relaxing concert set to the sweet and gentle musical stylings of Priscilla Ahn?
With an angelic voice and a softly spoken acoustic guitar to match, this California native singer-songwriter is sure to create a melodic and peaceful ambiance. Stressed out students anticipating their slew of finals to come can take a breather and calm down with this low-key, indie girl on the rise.
Ahn is touring to promote her latest album, When You Grow Up, and her earlier release, A Good Day, both of which are beautifully simplistic yet entirely honest musical testaments subtle in their delivery but that speak to deeper emotional themes.
This indie “it” girl will perform at the El Rey Theatre on Friday, Dec. 2, with tickets starting at $17, available on Ticketmaster.
Be sure to check out this singer-songwriter up-and-comer before she makes it big.
Hammer Conversations: Angela Davis & Robin Levi
Though the Hammer Museum is best known for its varied, acclaimed art exhibitions, its public programs are also noteworthy.
The Hammer Conversation series aims to bring prolific, influential figures into intimate discussions with the public, and the museum will host two activists whose bodies of work are impressive and significant: Angela Davis and Robin Levi.
Davis is best known for her efforts in the ’60s and ’70s, when she gained massive respect for her fight for social justice and activism in the Civil Rights movement, as well as notoriety for her involvement with the Communist Party and the Black Panthers.
Levi is the human rights director at Justice Now and has recently garnered acclaim for her book of essays by female prisoners, Inside This Place, Not of It: Narratives from Women’s Prisons.
The discussion is set for 7 p.m. today, and will be followed by a book signing for Levi’s new work. Even better, the discussion is free for visitors and parking is only $3.
Jingle Ball
If you’re looking for an unconventional start to the holidays, KIIS FM’s Jingle Ball will be a surefire way to celebrate the beginning of winter break.
Surely the biggest concert of the Christmas season, Jingle Ball will feature goodies in the form of mainstream superstars, such as Lady Gaga, David Guetta, Flo Rida, Sean Paul, Gym Class Heroes and Taio Cruz. The festivities will be held at L.A. Live’s illustrious Nokia Theatre on Saturday.
But that’s not all. Jingle Ball will also introduce two lesser-known artists to the big stage: the quirky duo Karmin and pop band Big Time Rush from the Nickelodeon TV series of the same name, both promising groups sure to have even brighter futures.
Tickets are selling fast, so be sure to check out KIIS FM’s website for ticket options. KIIS is also holding a slew of contests to give away tickets. Find a way to get your hands on some tickets.
The Joffrey Ballet’s The Nutcracker
Christmas is nearing, bringing with it a few timeless traditions: stringing up technicolor lights, re-watching 1964’s claymation treasure, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and, of course, watching performances of the Tchaikovsky-scored classic The Nutcracker.
Though you might be tired of seeing small, ho-hum versions of this show, it’s an entirely different animal in the hands of a talented cast.
And talk about a talented cast: The famed Chicago company of the Joffrey Ballet will be making a visit to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles to perform its critically acclaimed version of the seminal holiday ballet. It’s part of the 2011-2012 season of “Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at the Music Center,” which has garnered plenty of praise.
Tickets are going quickly, and this promises to be one of the most impressive versions of The Nutcracker. The show is only running six performances starting today through Saturday, and tickets can be found on the Music Center’s website with prices ranging from $34 to $125.

Let’s be honest:
Yes, Short Order is another burger joint in a town already overflowing with great — often astounding — burgers.
There’s no need to discuss the other great bun-meat-bun combos in Los Angeles, as a quick Google search will leave you dizzy with Chowhound and Yelp arguments over which burger runs this town.
Burger bliss · Los Angeles is full of delicious burger joints, but Short Order stands apart from the rest. With a fresh take on the tried-and-true American burger and fries, Short Order is not one to miss. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
And the bickering seems impossible to settle: After all, the burger is a beautifully simple concoction, but one that can be toyed with a billion different delicious ways.
Short Order, the brainchild of local food goddesses Nancy Silverton and the late Amy Pressman, only adds another angle to the discussion.
Nestled into the west corner of the Original Farmer’s Market on Third Street and Fairfax Avenue, it doesn’t attract much attention — you’d likely miss it during a shopping trip at the Grove.
Find it, though, and the restaurant will win over your heart and belly.
Exhibit A: the eponymous Short Order burger. It comes casually wrapped in paper, looking rather nondescript — no huge stacks of bacon, no odd garnishes. It looks, in fact, rather ordinary.
But take a bite and it’s like getting slapped in the face: the grass-fed beef bristles with juice, a smear of mustard-laced mayo adds a rich, spicy edge and the cheese…
…Is that really Morbier, the notoriously aromatic semi-soft French cheese? Yes it is, and it works magnificently here, helped by a quick blast of heat that melts it seductively and tempers the cheese’s assertive fragrance.
It’s a bold choice, motivated by a clever knowledge of how to balance strong flavors. Cheddar? American? Please — those are mundane in comparison. The addition of sautéed shittakes and portabello mushrooms almost seems gratuitous at this point, but they work perfectly to supercharge the burger’s savoriness.
Short Order’s menu is eclectic, but the options are simple and well-executed. Nancy’s Backyard Burger is a fresh take on the usual flavors of a burger with guacamole, mellow avocado and sweet tomato playing off the salty-smoky goodness of thick artisan bacon. And the non-beef options are equally alluring: A pork burger, for instance, is dressed up with sauteed broccoli rabe and stracchino, a velvety young Italian cheese.
Whatever you get, make sure to pick up a side of Short Order spuds, fried chunks of potato with delectably brittle crusts and fluffy insides. Then take it to the next level with earthy truffle salt and the dipping sauce — a concoction of sour cream, chives and bacon that makes the spuds taste like the baked potato of your dreams.
But where the food excels, the service falters. It’s a fault of design — Short Order features an upstairs dining room complete with a posh, glossy-marble-topped bar, but it’s too small to accommodate the crowds with waits routinely exceeding an hour.
The charming downstairs patio features full service as well, but bizarrely only offers a pared-down menu that lacks the non-beef burger options and open-faced “rafts.” The patio also serves as a mingling area for those picking up take-out orders, which makes a bit of a mess of the waiters, who often appear lost.
It’s the kind of service that is amusing in its awkwardness — it’s warm and capable when you can find someone to pay attention to you, but it’s no easy feat.
One night, after a few too many minutes of waiting, a waiter cocked his head and wandered over.
“So … do you folks want some drinks … or something?” he asked with a smile, mussing his blond hair.
And more than once, a waiter ambled over to the table with a brown paper bag bulging with food.
“Did you place a takeout order?” they would politely inquire. No,
not quite.
But when the food finally arrives, the sins are easily forgotten. How could they not be?  Take a sip of Short Order’s maddeningly tasty custard shakes and try to be upset — you can’t. Note the little details, such as the hipster Ball mason jars they use as glassware or the little pots of lemon thyme that serve as table decoration.
It’s clear Pressman and Silverton cared about making this a comfortable place to eat delicious, simple food without sacrificing quality. In many ways, Short Order achieves these goals.
It’s a bit of a shame, then, that the waitstaff must jostle with logistics. But considering the track record of its owners, Short Order will and must iron out these wrinkles — there are simply too many good burger options in this city to survive otherwise.
But with each bite, you somehow forget the bad: the clumsy service, the other burgers you could be eating, the 35 minutes you waited in the late November chill.
In the end, it all goes back to the food.

USC needs veggie options
The culinary desires and restrictions of USC students have become more diverse over the years as the student body has increased, yet campus eateries do not provide necessary alternatives. USC must fulfill students’ dietary needs by improving the selection of foods on campus.
Students limit the food in their bodies for health, religious and other reasons.
The Vegetarian Times found that 3.2 percent of U.S. adults follow a vegetarian-based diet, while 10 percent of U.S. adults say they largely follow a vegetarian-inclined diet, meaning that most of their meals consist of vegetarian dishes, with 42 percent of them aged 18 to 34 years old.
My senior year of high school, I decided to cut meat out of my diet in order to sustain a healthier lifestyle and protect animals’ rights. Ever since that day, I, like many other Americans, have a vegetarian diet.
The student body consists of a variety of people with different needs, including vegans, vegetarians, pescetarians and those with other dietary restrictions or food allergies.
Finding a variety of foods on campus to fulfill these needs is tough.
Anybody who has a restrictive diet knows the difficulties of eating out. It is important to know what ingredients are used to make the food and how the food is prepared.
Menus do not always list the ingredients for each meal, nor if certain foods, including meats and non-meats, have been cooked on the same surfaces or in the same oils, using the same utensils. Increased vegan, vegetarian and friendly gluten-free foods need to be more readily available on campus and at reasonable prices with ingredients listed.
College is a time when students move out on their own and are first responsible for feeding themselves on a budget. As college campuses including Tufts and Boston College become more vegetarian and vegan friendly, USC needs to follow in their footsteps and improve their food options by considering all dietary needs.
Not only should there be more reasonably priced prepared meals for specific diets, but also more care in keeping food safe from cross-contamination.
The dining options on campus today include more meat-friendly meals at the dining halls and Café 84, the Law School Café, Popovich Café, Tutor Café and Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
By incorporating healthier options at campus cafeterias and restaurants, students will be better nourished and their performance will improve.
Also, by making labels with ingredients, students will be better educated on what they put in their bodies.
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with a well-balanced diet is necessary for students activity and advancement in college.
Such a large and diverse university like USC must accommodate the student population’s wide variety of dietary concerns and needs.
Laura Maruszak
Junior, communication
Amen to that! We definitely need more Vegetarian options at USC..
Well, to be honest, we need BETTER food options. This business of greasy, nasty, cheap “food” is just too much for a university we’re paying $50k to attend…
We all are fortunate enough to live in a society where food is plentiful and relatively inexpensive. If we make decisions to that place restrictions on that abundance, then we need to face the consequences of those decisions and go through whatever additional effort is required to execute on that decision. I am growing weary of self  indulgent, self- entitled people that want society to bend over backwards and provide for their idiosyncratic wants and needs. So much of the world is starving and here we have so many spoiled people with such disgustingly critical conditions about their food. Grow up people – what is next – do you want mommy and daddy to pick out the brown M&M’s?
When I came to USC as an undergraduate in 2006, I had been a vegetarian for five years. As a freshman, I was restricted to eating at Parkside or EVK for a majority of my meals due tot he required meal plans at the time. 
Maintaining a healthy vegetarian diet at USC’s dining halls proved extremely difficult. My vegan/veggie friends and I had a running joke about EVK’s “vegetarian section”: steamed vegetables, plain pasta, rice and occasionally a cheese-based pasta. Most of us were limited to those foods, the salad bar (and it’s horrible, rancid tofu), PB&J sandwiches, french fries and grilled cheese (for non vegans.)
To maintain some variety in my diet, I took the bus to Trader Joes and would stock my dorm fridge with food, even though I was being forced to pay for the meal plan. 
I wrote to Hospitality Services many times and never got a response. That first year, I lost a considerable amount of weight and became very ill just because the protein-rich veggie foods I had ate at home were not available at USC. 
Now that I’m back at USC, I’m glad to see the little fridge of vegan/veggie foods at Seeds — but it still isn’t enough!
Thanks a lot Laura for making this point. I am a lacto-vegetarian, and find it very difficult to get vegan/ lacto-vegetarian food on campus.. Also as you state, the food is contaminated with nearby meat based food.. Basically the cooking utensils, etc are the same.. Good Karma Cafe in USC is the only full vegetarian lunch service, google it if you don’t know about that..

Students reacted positively to last week’s announcement that the USC Undergraduate Student Government has begun pushing for a fall break; I find myself wondering, however, if USG isn’t jumping the gun on this one.
Having entered USC just this year, I never knew the trials of having only two class days off for Thanksgiving. I can guess, however, that such a situation would have rendered impossible my already super-condensed travel plans. Even with the addition of Wednesday to the vacation, many students found it difficult or downright pointless to travel home. I imagine it’s quite disheartening to spend five days on campus with three quarters of your building emptied out, getting text messages from your family about how they wish you were there and anticipating EVK or take-out as your Thanksgiving dinner. With its Wednesday victory, USG was on its way to rectifying this situation, but now USG has imprudently switched gears even though there is still more to accomplish.
So now we have two things on the table: a brand new fall break in the middle of October or the coveted full-length Thanksgiving vacation. It seems unrealistic to expect that we could get both, unless we wanted to move the start of our school year to the first week of August. Pushing the beginning of the semester back even further would constrict summer travel, employment and durations of internships even more than the date already does. Alternatively, we could end our fall semester later;  neither students nor faculty accustomed to USC’s comfortably long Christmas break, however, would appreciate such a move.
USG is thus left with two options to pursue. I know which I would prefer — a week-long Thanksgiving break, hands down. First of all, Thanksgiving break is preexisting and USC is never going to entirely abolish it. If we’re going to have Thanksgiving off, we might as well be able to spend it with our families. An entire week of break would make that possible for students otherwise seriously questioning the worth of perhaps an entire day’s worth of travel for just four days at home.
Fall break, on the other hand, exists only in theory. This makes it a less feasible option. To lobby for a fall break, USG has to start from scratch, whereas it has already put in two years of concentrated effort into extending Thanksgiving break.
The university will probably be much more accommodating in discussing the extension of Thanksgiving, simply because channels on the subject of communication are already open. How much more trouble and time will it take to initiate a new project, particularly one that requires negotiating an entire week’s worth of classes, as opposed to lobbying for just two extra days?
Aside from the direct appeal of spending the holiday at home, having time off at Thanksgiving instead of in October also provides a better window of opportunity to visit with people who might be away from home a lot themselves or geographically far away. Even those who don’t celebrate Thanksgiving probably want to be home for it, as their parents will be off from work, their siblings and friends will have returned from other schools and vacations or other excursions might be planned.
October is much more questionable. There is no standard for the fall break, no guarantee that one institution’s fall break (if it even has one) will coincide with another friends’. And though it has been argued that a break in October would provide students with some much-needed relief in the middle of the semester, USG should think realistically. It’s possible that students who actually traveled this Thanksgiving got very little in the way of homework done during the trip. No doubt, lots of post-travel all-nighters were pulled. At least at this point in the semester, none of us are ruining ourselves for midterms. A month ago, however? Things would have been a disaster.
USG needs to consider the impracticality of asking for a fall break when an extension of Thanksgiving break is a much more viable option.
Instead of initiating a process that could take a decade to succeed, USG should finish what it started and work for a change it knows will please the student body — a real Thanksgiving vacation.
 
Francesca Bessey is an undeclared freshman.
I agree. For out-of-state students, a one week Thanksgiving break would allow students the option to visit friends and family but the addition of a fall break would only cause disruption to studies and work schedules.

Anthony Weiner, Vanessa Hudgens, a Chicago school principal. What do these people have in common? They’ve all gotten flak for having naked pictures on the Internet.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Stories of people digitally compromising their dignity are everywhere. Whether or not we heed the warnings about appropriate online conduct, we’ve all heard them. But online image problems aren’t always about averting crises. The stakes aren’t always so high. Often, the desire for more control over one’s digital identity comes from a more subtle place. Every day, we become slightly different people. The changes are so small and gradual that we often don’t notice them, but they accumulate. Have you found yourself looking at photos from high school and wondering what you could have possibly been thinking? I have. Changes tend to be especially meaningful during our first few decades. Three years might not mean much to a 50-year-old, but if you’re 18, three years make up almost 17 percent of your life. Before the Internet, it was easy to keep the nature and extent of these changes private. People expressed themselves in media that couldn’t be easily reproduced. It was understood that the scraps of one’s former self — old journals, drawings and notes — could be pushed aside neatly, away from prying eyes. Nowadays, people tend to express themselves online. It’s incredibly easy. Why buy a book and pull out a glue stick when you can make a scrapbook on Tumblr? This shift has made our former selves blatantly public. All the creative material we generate online stays there. It’s true you can put up passwords or remove content altogether. Unfortunately, though, you can’t always predict what you’ll find embarrassing later — and by that point, it could be too late. Anything digital has the potential to go viral. A friend recently posted a funny image on Facebook. The picture showed a girl who had photoshopped herself with Robert Pattinson and a baby; she added in phrases like, “You are … my religion,” to drive home her devotion. I laughed, but then I wondered how the girl would feel about the picture in a year. She wouldn’t be able to delete it. It’s simply out of her hands. This conundrum is a much milder version of what famous actors, musicians and writers have been experiencing for years. Anyone who makes it big has to live down his or her sillier endeavors. The public at large doesn’t care about the rest of us quite as much, but still: Are you okay with your college friends reading poetry from your 14-year-old self? It’s true some people make careers out of posting about their personal lives online. One notable example is the website ThoughtCatalog.com, a place where writers — usually young, and usually urban — chronicle their likes, dislikes, opinions and lives. The operator of the site doesn’t see it as a side project. It’s his job. Talking about his weekend exploits allows him to pay his bills. But what if he were to decide to switch careers? He could take the site down, but his material has already been Facebooked, blogged and tweeted to thousands of people. The Internet is a great place to experiment with new identities, but it’s wise to do so with caution. You might think you’ll be the same person next year, but you can never predict what life will bring. Consider adopting an alias.   Maya Itah is a senior majoring in communication.

An increasing number of USC seniors are applying to alternative career programs to give back to the community and not as a result of the poor economy.
Teach for America, Teach for China and City Year Los Angeles, organizations that allow recent graduates to teach in areas with economic disparities, report a continued increase in the number of applications from USC seniors since 2008, and the organizations predict that numbers will again rise this year.
Aware of the decrease in job opportunities during their four years in college, students increased interest in alternative programs, which is reflective of an increased interest in making a difference in their community after graduation and joining a network similar to the Trojan Family, said London Moore, manager of campus recruitment for TFA.
Moore said TFA, the fifth largest employer of USC students, has already seen an increase in applications this year, and the largest number of students already admitted to the program this year has been from USC.
Chi Zhang, Teach for China’s manager of U.S. recruiting and university relations, said students’ increased interest in the programs has to do with a desire to have a diverse experience after graduation.
“Students may not know exactly what sector they want to be working in [after graduation], and Teach for China exposes them to a diverse range of people,” Zhang said. “They are able to think or rethink their choices after the gap year and figure out what they want to do in the future. Students are in a challenging setting for two years, and [future] employers see a tenacious individual, who really makes a contribution in whatever circumstances [he or she is] in.”
Tracy St. Dic, recruitment director at TFA, said in an email that students’ interest in TFA is reflective of the influence of the USC community.
“The students who apply to Teach For America are amazing students,” St. Dic said. “They are strong academically, they demonstrate leadership on campus, at their work, or in their volunteer experience they’ve gone to USC, lived in South Central Los Angeles, and understand that not every kid in this country has the opportunity to become a Trojan. They know they can do something about that, right out of college.”
Tricia Dong, a senior majoring in international relations (global business), will teach science at a public secondary school in Hawaii through TFA, after working at the institute where the organization trains its teachers over the summer.
She said volunteering for Jumpstart, a USC group whose members assist and teach at the County Kids Child Development Center on 30th Street each week, opened her eyes to problems with the educational system.
“I saw a gap between higher income and lower income students,” Dong said. “This is such a pressing issue that it’s something I need to participate in now more than ever.”
Dong said she plans to start extracurricular activities in the community, and hopes her students will be able to look to her as a role model.
“I feel like everyone has a teacher who influenced them [before college],” Dong said. “Now I’m excited to become one of those influential teachers.”
