In the past year, the Keck School of Medicine of USC received more average funding per researcher from the National Institutes of Health than any other medical school in the nation, according to a press release.
The Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research found that between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2016, Keck received more than $140.8 million in NIH grants. The school ranked 30th nationally in total grants received, its highest position to date since the Blue Ridge Institute began its rankings in 2006.
According to the Keck School of Medicine, a total of 158 principal investigators, otherwise known as researchers, received an average grant of $891,000.
“The Keck School of Medicine of USC No. 1 ranking in NIH funds received per principal investigator demonstrates the strength of researchers that we attract at the Keck School,” Thomas Buchanan,  vice dean for research at Keck, said in a press release. “These competitive grants allow us to further innovate and support our mission to improve the quality of life for individuals and society by promoting health, preventing and curing disease, advancing biomedical research and educating tomorrow’s physicians and scientists.”
Furthermore, seven Keck School of Medicine departments ranked within the 20 highest NIH-funded departments in their respective categories, including the departments of microbiology, neurology, urology, otolaryngology, preventive medicine, ophthalmology and physiology. The school’s departments of ophthalmology and preventive medicine were both placed second nationally in the amount of funding received from NIH, receiving a total of $12,347,629 and $33,223,457, respectively.

The USC Rossier School of Education is making strides to teach the education community about the Common Core State Standards through its interactive guide, a non-partisan source of information about the Common Core and what it looks like in today’s schools.
According to Corrine Hyde, an associate teaching professor of clinical education at Rossier, the Common Core is a set of national educational standards for grades K-12 in English  and math  with the goal of preparing students for success in the future. As of today, 42 states, the District of Columbia, four territories and the Department of Defense Education Activity have adopted these standards. 
“Common Core is game changing, for better or worse,” Hyde said. “In the past, each state has written its own standards for learning. Most states have aligned themselves now with Common Core, and so understanding what Common Core establishes as the knowledge and skills students should have in math and English is critical for anyone involved with education.”
According to Rossier’s guide, the problem with each state defining its own learning goals was that each state also defined what it meant to be proficient. In order to create the Common Core, the writing teams at Rossier researched the best state educational standards at the time in order to figure out the types of standards successful states had in common.
Ross Brenneman, a media relations specialist at Rossier, said the general public often does not understand the nuanced context of the Common Core. The latest poll conducted by Rossier and Policy Analysis for California Education found that 39 percent of California voters said they had read little or nothing about the Common Core State Standards.
“The standards have been in place for a half dozen years,” Brenneman wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “So we like to think this guide offers a solid grounding for those interested.”
The seven-part guide includes a map of the Common Core by state, indicating where it has been formally adopted, partially adopted and repealed across the nation. It also features examples of questions used in the curriculum and the best way for teachers to go about explaining the Common Core to parents.
Hyde said she believes helping teachers understand the Common Core is important because of the changes the new standards will create. 
“In the past, each state has written its own standards for learning,” Hyde wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Most states have aligned themselves now with Common Core, and so understanding what Common Core establishes as the knowledge and skills students should have in math and English is critical for anyone involved with education.”
Michelle Manno, the communications manager for Rossier’s  Master of Arts in Teaching and Doctor of Education online graduate degree programs, said that learning about the Common Core is crucial in the current political climate, especially with the appointment of a new Secretary of Education. 
“[The guide] is a way to have a more general, objective, truthful understanding of the Common Core,” Manno said.
Since the guide was released in October, Manno said the team has received positive feedback from teachers in the education community.
Hyde added that there are several major misconceptions about the Common Core, and the guide serves to provide the most accurate information.
“Common Core is often misunderstood, and it is also often polarizing,” Hyde said.  “People seem to love it or hate it, but many of the reasons they give for both positions are not accurate reflections of what Common Core actually is.”

Eleven. As far as national championships go, that number breathes rarified air. Very few schools can boast 11 national championships in all sports combined, but two Los Angeles powerhouses own 11 titles within a single program — USC in football and UCLA in basketball.
Long heralded as the respective football and basketball schools of the West Coast, USC and UCLA each take tremendous pride in upsetting the other in its bread-and-butter sport. Last year, USC swept the two sports with a win at the Coliseum and a 3-0 record in basketball. The last time that happened was in the 2009-10 season, but the basketball teams only met twice that year. Before last season, the last time USC basketball won three games against UCLA was the 1953-54 campaign. 
One must go back even further to find the last time USC took four straight games in the crosstown series. On Wednesday night, the Trojans have an opportunity to accomplish that for the first time in 75 years.
But this year’s UCLA team looks a lot different than last year’s.
“Their offense is exceptional [given] the way they share the ball and the pace they play at,” head coach Andy Enfield said. 
The eighth-ranked team in the nation (dropping from No. 3 after a loss to Arizona on Saturday), UCLA has a firecracker offense that averages 93 points per game — aided by a whopping six players who average double-figure points per game. The Bruins also have a supremely talented freshman class led by guards Lonzo Ball and T.J. Leaf.
“Even though they’re our rival, we’re not going to go out of our way to watch their games,” junior guard Elijah Stewart said. “I’ve got a lot of homework at ’SC, so you kind of look at the standings, but you don’t go out of your way to watch games.” 
This year, the Trojans find themselves in familiar territory as underdogs against their Westwood foes. But in this rivalry, anything can happen. In 2013, USC ended a four-game skid against the Bruins in overtime at the Pauley Pavilion with a 75-71 victory under interim head coach Bob Cantu. UCLA standout Shabazz Muhammad, who now plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA, had a monster game, but USC’s guard play held the Bruins to 2-of-19 from 3-point range. 
Prior to last season, USC’s last victory against UCLA at the Galen Center came in 2011, when NBA star Nikola Vucevic wore No. 5 in Cardinal and Gold. The 7-footer dropped 20 points on the Bruins and became the 16th overall pick with the Philadelphia 76ers that spring .
A Trojan victory on Wednesday night would break a nine-year stretch during which USC has not defeated a top-five ranked opponent. Lo and behold, their last win against such a team came against No. 4 UCLA at Pauley Pavilion in 2008. The game featured several future NBA talents including Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, Taj Gibson and O.J. Mayo. Yet even in a game with such adept players, emotions ruled.
“We were so caught up, and our emotions took over,” then-UCLA head coach Ben Howland said after the loss. “We made some bad decisions. I can’t remember us ever being like that in the last few years.”
Though Love notched a double-double, his team went scoreless in the last two minutes and let the Trojans escape with their third win in 13 previous attempts in Westwood. USC freshman Davon Jefferson credited the win to a prophetic dream his mother had: His mom dreamed that they won and that Jefferson played well. He actually did end up playing exceptionally, scoring a career-high 25 points, including the team’s last eight. The Trojans finished the 2008 season with a first-round loss in the NCAA Tournament, while the Bruins marched all the way to the Final Four.
Wednesday’s game emanates a faint and distant sense of déjà vu. The Bruins have a similar agenda in 2017 as they did in ’08. Anything less than a Final Four would be a disappointment for the second highest-scoring offense in the nation. The Trojans have a pair of freshman guards, Jonah Mathews and De’Anthony Melton, who have risen to starting roles. If they can emulate the success of Jefferson and Mayo, then USC will stand a chance.
“It’s the Pac-12, so anyone can beat you on any given night,” Mathews said. 
The Trojans will have a full house behind them, full of energy. The game sold out over one month ago when both teams were undefeated. But USC is not letting rivalry emotions defeat their routine. 
“We’re looking forward to a sold-out crowd on Wednesday night and competing against a top-ranked team,” Enfield said.
“Every night it’s a grind,” he added about Pac-12 play. 
Enfield and his team are focused on one opponent at a time. The next one just happens to bring decades of historic rivalry into the Galen Center.

As much as it may irk those in the land of Troy to acknowledge, this is the truth: UCLA is an NCAA title contender this season and will be the heavy favorite in Wednesday night’s rivalry game at the Galen Center.
Despite the bitter reality, however, Trojan fans will be forever hopeful that history finds some way of beautifully repeating itself when USC takes the floor against the now eighth-ranked Bruins.
Back in 2008, a scrappy Trojan team — led by standout point guard O.J. Mayo (yikes) — upset a title-contending and fourth-ranked UCLA team on the road, 72-63.
This year, the Bruins (19-2, 6-2) will enter the Galen Center coming off a 96-85 conference loss at the hands of then-No. 14 Arizona. 
The Trojans will tip off against No. 8 UCLA after taking on a pair of Pac-12 opponents from Arizona this past weekend. USC split the weekend series, defeating Arizona State but falling short in a late comeback bid against Arizona. In Sunday’s victory over the Sun Devils, junior guard Elijah Stewart went off for 29 points and hit seven 3-pointers.
It’s awfully hard to find merit in any loss, especially a loss to a high-ranking conference foe like Arizona. But while the box score for USC’s 73-66 loss against the Wildcats last week was not all that intriguing, the Trojans exhibited an explosive offense capable of making game-changing runs.
The Trojans trailed Arizona by as much as 22 points with 11 minutes remaining in regulation. After going on a 28-11 run late in the second half, USC was able to pull within a possession of the Wildcats, 67-64, with a minute left to play. As mentioned, despite the very intriguing comeback, USC was unable to come back and knock off the Wildcats; as they say, the hot streak was simply too little, too late for the Trojans.
But hey, here’s a silver lining: Give USC five more minutes of regulation in that contest, and it’s not all too crazy to think that the Trojans could have come away with a win over an Arizona team that is trending upward and is now ranked seventh in the nation. 
Wednesday night’s matchup with the Bruins marks the beginning of the home stretch for head coach Andy Enfield’s team. There are now only 10 conference games remaining in the 2017 season. 
Currently residing in sixth place in the Pac-12 standings, USC (17-4, 4-4) is in need of a strong finish if it hopes to bolster its seeding for the Pac-12 Tournament and, beyond that, the NCAA tournament. 
While the thought of upsetting UCLA on Wednesday night is glorious (and a bit of a stretch, realistically), USC fans ought to be patient and put things into perspective when looking at the remainder of the team’s schedule: Four of USC’s final 10 games this season will come against teams currently ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll. 
The first of these critical matchups will come this week at the Galen Center against UCLA. The Trojans, who defeated UCLA on three occasions last season, will also be traveling to Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 18 to take on the Bruins. You’ve got to think that USC would feel really good about itself if it were able to steal at least one of these games from the guys playing at that other school in Westwood. 
An additional thought: If USC gave Arizona (a team who just defeated UCLA) all it could handle last Thursday, who’s to say the Trojans aren’t capable of posing a dangerous threat to the Bruins on Wednesday? 
The Trojans will wrap up their top-10 slate in February, going on the road to do battle with No. 7 Arizona (Feb. 23) and No. 10 Oregon (Feb. 11) in the final month of the regular season. 
With all that being said, USC must capitalize on this season by winning all of the games that — on paper — they should be able to come away with. The remainder of USC’s schedule includes conference opponents such as Washington State (10-9, 3-4), Washington (9-10, 2-5), Arizona State (9-11, 2-5) and Oregon State (4-16, 0-7). These teams have a combined record of 32-46, and all are currently sitting in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings. 
Sporting a 17-4 record with 10 games remaining, I’d say that USC is in a prime position to exceed the 20-win mark for the second consecutive season. Unless the Trojans fail to execute in the winnable games they have over the next month, Enfield’s team should finish better than the 21-13 record it had last season, which generated much hype for USC men’s hoops. 
To make things simple, here’s the recipe for USC: Win the games you should win, and steal one of these games against a high-ranking opponent like Arizona, Oregon or UCLA. If the Trojans can gather these ingredients, then a healthy ranking entering tournament play will be stewing. 
In his most recent Bracketology report, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi ranked USC as the 35th-best team in the nation. And if March Madness were to commence today, Lunardi projects that USC would head to Indianapolis as the No. 9 seed (playing No. 8 seed TCU) in the South bracket in the first round.
With less than 50 days remaining till Selection Sunday for the NCAA Tournament, the question begs to be asked: Where will USC finish in the rankings?
The ball is in their court.

The top defensive tackle in the nation for the class of 2017, Marlon Tuipulotu, announced Monday night via Twitter that he will be decommitting from Washington and joining the USC football team next fall as a freshman. The announcement comes nine days before National Signing Day.
USC hosted Tuipulotu on an official visit this weekend before the five-star defensive lineman announced his decision Monday. 
“This was a tough decision for me, and I have nothing but love for the players, the school and the coaches at the [University of Washington] … I honestly wish them nothing but the best in everything they do,” Tuipulotu said on Twitter. “I am still planning to graduate early and will be attending the University of Southern California.”
Tuipulotu will be graduating from Central High School in Independence, Ore. this week; he will enroll early at USC and arrive on campus this semester. 
The 6-foot-2, 295-pound defensive lineman was selected to the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in his senior season. Recruiting sites such 247Sports have rated Tuipulotu as a five-star tackle, while Rivals projected him as a four-star prospect. 
Tuipulotu was rated the top recruit from the state of Oregon this season. He is ranked the No. 60 player overall nationally in the composite rankings. 
The acquisition of Tuipulotu is crucial for USC. Tuipulotu will aid in filling a large hole at defensive tackle for USC after the team lost players such as Noah Jefferson to transfer and Rose Bowl MVP Stevie Tu’ikolovatu to graduation. 
Tuipulotu, a long time Washington commit, made his initial verbal commitment to play for the Huskies back in April 2016. 
In addition to recruiting Tuipulotu, USC also hosted the No. 2 rated defensive tackle in the nation, Jay Tufele,  on an official visit this past weekend. 
USC gave his brother a job handing out water bottles for 100k a year, of course he flipped. All about making that money, right Marlon.

USC women’s water polo ran riot in Santa Barbara over the weekend, beating five teams in three days to cap an undefeated UCSB Winter Invitational. The No. 2 Trojans faced a tough challenge to open their season, going into a tournament against five other ranked programs, but five emphatic victories put the defending NCAA champions head-and-shoulders above the rest of their top-25 competition.
USC began the invitational last Friday against No. 9 Michigan. The Wolverines kept things close early on, canceling out goals from senior 2-meter Brigitta Games and senior drivers Nikki Stansfield and Stephania Haralabidis to keep the score knotted at 3-3. The Trojans were finally able to pull away, however, thanks to two quick scores from freshman utility Maud Megens. USC ran away with the game from there, with five other Trojans grabbing goals (two from freshman driver Denis Mammolito). Michigan couldn’t beat sophomore goalie Amanda Longan after its early success, and Longan finished the 11-3 victory with 13 saves — one from a penalty shot.
Senior Victória Chamorro replaced Longan in cage on Saturday for USC’s next game against No. 22 Cal Baptist, and she recorded 11 saves in a Trojan demolition job. Three players scored hat tricks for USC, including a career-high four goals for sophomore driver Courtney Fahey. Megens stayed hot against the Lancers as well, with junior driver Brianna Daboub completing the hat-trick trio. Haralabidis, Mammolito and freshman driver Elise Stein also scored two goals apiece in USC’s 22-1 blowout. Cal Baptist narrowly avoided getting shut out, beating Chamorro with 20 seconds left in the final quarter.
No. 23 Cal State Northridge was up next for USC, and the Trojans dispatched the Matadors in similarly comfortable fashion. Megens scored another hat trick to increase her tally to eight goals in three games, and senior driver Ionna Haralabidis — Stephania’s twin sister — also grabbed three goals. Seven others found the score sheet as USC cruised to a 16-3 win with Longan back in goal.
The Haralabidis twins then took over in full on Sunday. No. 5 Hawaii was the Trojans’ toughest challenge yet, but seven combined goals from the sisters (four from Ioanna Haralabidis, three from Stephania Haralabidis) propelled USC to a 13-8 victory. One goal from each Haralabidis gave the Trojans an early 2-0 lead that they would not surrender until the end of the game.
Finally, USC wrapped up against the hosts, No. 9 UC Santa Barbara. A whopping nine goals from Stephania Haralabidis (a career high) sank the Gauchos with Chamorro and freshman Holly Parker splitting time in cage. All in all, Stephania Haralabidis recorded 20 goals in five games, and the 19-5 blowout meant the Trojans returned to Los Angeles boasting a perfect 5-0 record.
The impressive Winter Invitational showing further extended USC’s incredible winning streak, which largely came from last year’s undefeated, championship-winning squad. Including the win over UCSB, the Trojans have notched 32 consecutive victories and have not lost since the 2015 NCAA semifinal. They will look to make it 34 in a row on Saturday, when they take on Concordia and Whittier in a doubleheader in Riverside.

The USC Thornton Symphony played at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on Sunday. Conducted by Carl St. Clair, the principal conductor at Thornton, the performance featured keyboard studies faculty Bernadene Blaha and Kevin Fitz-Gerald as soloists during “Concerto in E-Flat Major for Two Pianos, K.365,” as well as an expanded orchestra beyond what is normally called for in “An Alpine Symphony.”
Wolfgang Mozart wrote “Concerto in E-Flat Major for Two Pianos, K.365” in 1779 while he was the court organist in Salzburg, Austria. The piece called for an orchestra and two solo pianists, marrying different styles he learned from his two-year European tour prior to gaining the position. The piece has two movements, both featuring the soloists prominently with a more scaled back orchestra to accompany it.
Richard Strauss’ “An Alpine Symphony” was composed in 1915 after the death of Gustav Mauhler in 1911. The piece takes the form of a tone poem, which tells the story of a trek through the Alps, beginning and ending in the evening. There are 22 unique parts of the symphony that detail the trek up to the top of the Alps and then back down again.
Mozart’s “Concerto in E-Flat Major For Two Pianos, K.365” had a vibrant tone, complemented by fast and precise playing. The USC Symphony acted as a framework for the two pianists, playing each note with purpose so as not to overpower the pair. The Symphony remained reserved as they played, concentrating on their parts so as to play them exactly.
As a result, the piece felt like more of an exercise in technicality than anything else. Every bow moved in sync, and each head bobbed in tandem. There was no room for emotion outside of the constraints of the piece because of its sheer complexity. As a result, the USC Symphony went through the motions of the music.
Nevertheless, the most impressive display during this segment of the concert was the playing of Blaha and Fitz-Gerald. While the parts written for them to play were very different from each other, the pianists were able to make them cohesive so that neither part outshined the other. At times, their fingers moved so quickly that one could scarcely see the notes being carried out. The pair played with an air of levity, sweeping over each key as if performing the steps to a ballet. Throughout the piece, Blaha and Fitz-Gerald had a unique chemistry, with one of the pianists periodically glancing up at their counterpart to ensure that they were both in tandem.
In contrast, “An Alpine Symphony” swelled with emotion, building from the suppressed and suspenseful “Night” to the triumphant “Summit” and then making its way back to “Night” again. Each of the 22 sections had its own personality, requiring the members of the orchestra to play quietly one moment and then thunder with noise the next.
The louder moments were particularly rewarding, with each instrumentalist allowing the swelling notes to move through their bodies, scarcely contained by the chairs they sat in. The horn section filled the air with jubilation in “Sunrise,” hailing the newly risen sun with a welcome that had the tenacity of a sporting event. During darker moments, each section turned to a lower register of notes to signify a foreboding danger.
Some of the softer moments, however, lacked dimension. The soft side of the piece was best when it was minimalistic. “Calm Before the Storm” created an air of suspense, as the violins barely moved their bows from side to side, waiting patiently for the storm to crash in. Similarly, “Night” relied on the efforts of some of the lower register instruments, as they whispered longingly for the coming crescendo, musically symbolizing the arrival of daytime.
The piece, which requires more players than a symphony normally would have, was at its best when it incorporated sounds that worked against the grain, thanks to the efforts of some of the percussion elements. During “Alpine Fields,” cowbells chimed in to mimic the path of animals, creating a surprising moment of humor and contrast. A rainstick was used to add an element of danger to “Thunder and Storm,” contributing to the chaos of the swelling strings and blaring horns.
Ultimately, “Concerto in E-Flat Major for Two Pianos, K.365” and “An Alpine Symphony” both demonstrated the talent and technical prowess of the USC Thornton Symphony. Both pieces were presented effortlessly and captivated the audience with their raw nature and emotional spirit.

My bike got stolen on the last day of last semester. I was stupid, really. My bike lock broke earlier that week, and after seven days of procrastinating and pushing my luck, my green-and-purple glitter bike with the loose seat and broken breaks was gone.
I was kicking myself about it for days and weeks afterwards. That bike bought me an extra 10 minutes of sleep before my morning classes. I used to take it on the Metro rail, trying to hold it at a precarious perfect angle so the handlebars wouldn’t stab rush-hour commuters. On Valentine’s Day one year, I rode my bike four miles to the nearest Krispy Kreme in an effort to make a grand romantic gesture. The bike was ugly and the doughnuts a little deflated, but that bike took me anywhere I needed to go.
With only one semester of college left, I’ve decided to tough it out for the remainder of the school year. Considering that I’ve only made it to one out of six classes on time, it hasn’t been off to a great start. But the slower pace definitely has some benefits. I love being able to see what’s happening on campus, which is something I never paid much attention to when I zoomed past large gatherings on my bike. I started noticing little things, such as the flowers by the football practice fields and the progress of the construction crews where the Finger Fountain used to be.
My lack of bike ownership has given me an appreciation for walking that is very similar to my appreciation for running. I have always enjoyed running because it gives me a chance to really get to know a place. The storefronts are not just facades that pass by the window of my Uber. That church on 29th Street can’t even contain the Gospel music that resonates from it on Sunday mornings. The children at the daycare there play outside on weekday afternoons — a nice little reminder that we don’t live in a bubble of 20-somethings.
Sometimes I run to Downtown, and it’s shocking how close it is. An easy jog from campus will get me to L.A. Live in 20 minutes. Running, or walking for that matter, also gives me a chance to be spontaneous.
Do I want to see what’s on the menu at that new cafe on Vermont? I take a quick look, see a smoothie that’s an enticing shade of purple and make a resolution to come back when I’m finished sweating for the day. That’s something that definitely would not have happened if I had to go through the inconvenient process of finding a place to lock my bike.
Or take my recent trip to Ralphs. I used to bike there, but it’s so close that there’s really no excuse to use my car. I generally choose to walk or run there now. On the way down Menlo, my boyfriend and I saw a tiny creature walking towards us on the sidewalk. It was black and white and has pointy ears, and at first, we couldn’t tell if it was a cat or a dog. It came closer, and that’s when its features became clear. It was a husky puppy that came bounding up to us and immediately lay at my feet.
The owner told us her name is Khaleesi. She lay on her back for a belly rub and my boyfriend and I eagerly obliged, scratching her belly and massaging her head, trying to earn the love of our new friend. Khaleesi approved. It got to the point where it was a little awkward to be so affectionate with someone else’s dog. We started to walk away, and Khaleesi turned over and ran to catch up with us. She trotted along, as if she also had Oreos to buy at Ralphs. Her owner called her back, and Khaleesi hesitantly went her separate way.
It made my day. A Ralphs run made my day. And to think it all started with a stolen bike.

Larchmont Boulevard is full of notable spots for breakfast and brunch, bakeries and everything in between. The center of this quaint strip of shops and restaurants includes the newest addition to the Larchmont culinary scene: Bardonna.
Formerly known as Groundwork Coffee, Bardonna took its place a couple weeks ago. However, owner Josh Pourgol assured Groundwork fans that the coffee hangout will reopen across the street.
The L.A. brunch scene isdefined by copious amounts of avocado toast and gravlax with bagel platters. Bardonna not only serves L.A. native Klatch Coffee, but the menu also features sea salt caramel lattes, Ahi poke bowls, savory polenta and a plethora of vegetarian soups.
Why go here over the neighboring Larchmont Bungalow lunch spot? Bardonna’s fast-casual setup and quaint secret garden in the back is a well-deserved Sunday brunch refuge.
Bardonna definitely appeals to the younger, MacBook-sporting students stepping in for a cup of coffee with a quiet atmosphere in the back patio. It doesn’t have the capacity to accommodate large parties, but it is an ideal location for coffee dates and meetings alike. No matter the occasion, Bardonna’s genuinely kind staff go out of its way to turn a simple cafe experience into a personable one.
Bardonna’s downsized interior and paper menus contribute to the rustic vibe of the cafe. Its drink section contains unique creations, such as a tall mason jar filled with an Arnold Palmer or a matcha shakerato — a signature staple only found at their Larchmont location.
The first and second pages of the paper menu have a variety of sandwich, soup, grain bowl and toast selections, satisfying whichever cuisine guests are in the mood for.
A prominent menu item is the shakshuka — a Mediterranean stew of tomatoes, eggs and different seasonings that goes for a mere $11, with three pieces of toast included. Bardonna also serves their avocado toast ($10) on five mini pieces of sourdough bread with a side of mixed greens salad. A more savory, comfort food option for the recent rainy L.A. days would be the white bean vegetarian chili ($7). Most dishes range from $7 to $20, making it an affordable option for any time of day. The menu caters to meat eaters, vegetarians and practitioners of any latest fad diet.
For dessert, Bardonna offers a selection of local, vegan and gluten-free baked goods ranging from almond croissants to multigrain scones — the ideal complement to any of their coffee beverages. These baked goods typically range from $2 to $5.
With its wide array of eclectic provisions, Bardonna is elevating the L.A. cafe game. Besides its extensive food menu, it also offers a kombucha menu with options such as a matcha, turmeric and plain shot of kombucha. In addition to its list of coffee variations, the exotic tea selection is rare for a cafe of its continental-casual stature.
After ordering food, visitors will have the option of sitting in one of three places: the busy outdoor sidewalk, the crowded indoor seating consisting of few tables and chairs or the back patio decorated with hanging succulents and exposed brick wall murals.
Nearby dessert establishements include Salt & Straw and Erin McKenna’s Bakery.
Bardonna is located in the heart of Larchmont Village at 139 1/2 North Larchmont Blvd. It is open everyday from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The musical cast of Amélie, A New Musical, adapted from the 2001 French film, performed their pre-broadway show at the Center Theater Group’s Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles. The musical made its L.A. debut at the Ahmanson Theater in December and is anticipating a move to Broadway in March.
The musical bases off the original 2001 film, which tells the whimsical story of a Parisian waitress named Amélie Poulain, who discovers an antique toy box in her apartment and is inspired to return it to its owner. Along the way, Amélie finds herself falling in love with Nino, the quirky owner of a photo scrapbook left behind at the train station.
Homeschooled by her parents, Amélie experienced a lonely childhood which nurtured an underdevelopment of her interpersonal and social skills. With a goldfish as her only companion, Amélie developed a unique sense of creativity and imagination as she was forced to be on her own.
The musical follows Amélie’s adventures as she inspires to bring genuine moments of joy and happiness into the lives of others. Amélie lives a complacent life of mediocrity, taking pleasure in the brief and minute moments of cheerfulness.
As a fully capable and independent young woman, she genuinely cares about the people in her life, such as her co-workers at the cafe, her father and her elderly neighbors. Amélie finds happiness in her own life by selflessly securing happiness of others.
Phillipa Soo stars as Amélie in this new musical. Soo is best known for her role as Eliza, Alexander Hamilton’s wife in the Broadway hit Hamilton.
She was nominated for a Tony Award for her stellar performances as a caring mother and wife.
Soo plays the character of Amélie gracefully and fearlessly; she is shy, sincere and pure. Soo unequivocally brings the magic and charm of the character to life, acting as the heart of the show.
Soo successfully portrays Amélie’s ambivalence toward being noticed by society and desire to remain hidden alone in the bastion of her apartment. Not only does Amélie’s character strike a balance between eccentric and banal, but the rest of the characters in the musical also display idiosyncratic qualities.
The supporting cast is a collection of hopeless comedic individuals ranging from a cafe co-worker obsessed with letters from her long-lost husband to an elderly neighbor who spends his days painting zoomed-in versions of the same painting to Nino, Amélie’s counterpart, who pieces together ripped, forgotten pictures from a photobooth at the train station. These exaggerated character types effectively create a world within Amélie unlike any other.
Although the storyline is small-scale, Amélie’s focus on the nuanced everyday events of life make the musical experience unique and nostalgic in itself. Amélie fuels its audience with its continuous, fairytale-like music numbers filled with curiosity about the everyday life of a Parisian.
The continuous music flows from piece to piece, keeping audiences engaged with a wide variety of moods and styles. The music reflects the quirky tone and lighthearted story of the musical. Not to mention, Soo’s voice pairs exceptionally well with the orchestral harmonies of each song.
Throughout the show, Amélie uses a variety of vibrant and colorful stage sets along with projected images that make the musical even more enjoyable to watch.
From the shimmery blue streamers of the ocean, to a romantic starry night projection in Paris, to the LED signage of the cafe and sex shop, Amélie truly does a spectacular job engaging the audience in every set.
Amélie ends on a touching moment as Amélie and Nino finally meet, no longer giving Amélie a place to hide. The trivial aspects of the storyline touches upon the idea that love and happiness can be found in the most unusual places for even the quirkiest individuals.
After having its time in Los Angeles, Amélie will move on to bigger and better things, officially debuting on the Broadway stage on April 3.

On Jan, 10, former President Barack Obama stepped up to a podium in his hometown of Chicago to address the nation for the final time. Filled with power and candor, the stunning piece of rhetoric was a heartbreaking farewell from a leader whose likability has only grown in the face of eminent darkness. One of the most memorable turns in his hour-long speech came when Obama took time to address white Americans in particular:
“For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn’t suddenly vanish in the 60s — that when minority groups voice discontent, they’re not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness. When they wage peaceful protest, they’re not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our Founders promised.”
It is beyond accurate to say that in 2016 political correctness became a buzzword, one of the most significant definers and defenders of ideology. But no one really seems keen on defining it — not Obama in his address, not the media outlets that publish quotes about it, and least of all the leaders who use this phrase themselves. Surely, one of the most talked-about political phrases of the year couldn’t have slipped by without having a definition attached to it.
If you believe what people are saying, political correctness can sound like a pretty scary thing. Political correctness can range from an extensive array of gender pronouns to affirmative action to not being able to call for a Muslim registry, or for building a wall, or the like. Basically, political correctness is language that appeals to liberal sensitivities at the expense of “real” political action — and it all goes back to being able to say what you want to say, like the Constitution promises us we can.
There is, however, something seriously insidious about those who want to pinpoint the damage on being labeled racist and sexist, rather than the consequences of mass deportation, blocking immigrants and refugees, building a wall, stripping away healthcare, limiting access to birth control, ignoring climate change and telling the women and people of color who suffer the most from these measures that they are being sensitive liberal snowflakes.
Perhaps most ridiculous and telling of all are the recent accusations by anti-PC pundits against Star Wars: Rogue One for its apparent display of “political correctness” — in that, according to them, the film is too propagandic, inorganic and arrogant simply for starring powerful women and people of color. These allegations uniquely demonstrate the racist and sexist edge of the phrase “political correctness.”
The people who use this phrase, mainly white men, assert over and over again that they are the ones at risk of being silenced by the sensitive and overwrought left. And yet, they are simultaneously so offended by the presence of female and black and brown bodies on their screens that they cannot stand it. This is, according to them, the end of free expression, politics leaking into the movies like a dirty plague.
Take a moment and imagine your entire world surrounded by movies and ads and television shows starring people who look like you. And imagine still being threatened by the few faces of color that make it to Hollywood. Imagine that luxury.  It is this simple example, thanks to Star Wars, that tears the rug right out from under anti-PC critics’ feet, shoves “political correctness” into a spotlight and showcases, so clearly, its insidious second layer. And yet, no one talks about this. No one stops to question what political correctness means — not Donald Trump, not Paul Ryan, not any other conservative leader who uses it. Anti-PC arguments are not aimed toward some higher honoring of the Constitution or the preservation of a free and outspoken democracy; they are –— very clearly — racism and sexism in disguise.
Looking back at his farewell address, Obama is correct. For white Americans, it may be hard to understand the idea of systemic racism. The idea that if born into a certain skin, the course of one’s future may have already been decided by structural disadvantage with roots going back to colonialism. That is a hard, hard fact to wrap your head around, especially if you have never had to think about it. But the idea that the very existence of minority groups threatens the voices of the white majority is wrong, illogical and rooted in fear.
“Political correctness” is never a mandate thrown at someone. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find a liberal or liberal publication who calls someone out for not being politically correct enough. No, political correctness is a conservative invention, always an insult slammed against something. It is a rock thrown against the tide of a changing, diversifying country, futile even despite the energy behind its claims.

Snowflake, this nonsensical thinking is exactly why the left was crushed in November and CA is in such dire financial straights.
Leftist crap pure and simple. What the hell happened to the USC I went to?
“political correctness is a conservative invention”? That’s just embarrassing. What we know today as political correctness was created by Marxists in the early 1920’s, the Frankfurt School, fascinating history, you should read up on it. See if any of these sound familiar, this is all from 90 years ago: creation of racism offenses, massive immigration to destroy national identity, teaching of sex and homosexuality to children, and encouraging the breakdown of the family. (((Their))) goal was to destroy Western Civilization, and you’d have to say they’ve done pretty well.
“It is beyond accurate..”  First time I ever heard that one.  Everybody goes to college now.
“A heartbreaking farewell from a leader whose likability has only grown in the face of eminent darkness.”  So dramatic.  I’d suggest that you stick with screenwriting for the fantasy and fiction genres and avoid history and politics, which are clearly not your forte.
Imagine that there is life outside the walls of the university. Your Rogue One racist rant is utter nonsense. No I NE cares whether the actors are black, white, male, female…. the role is the role and the screen writer determines the storyline.
The PC movement is not a conservative concept. It is purely designed by the liberals to try to force you to think and act in a manner that is acceptable to them.  It is mind control at its basic level.  Think about it.  
Back around 1995 we couldn’t say Merry Christmas anymore. It was Happy Holidays. The PC culture has gotten out of control and we are reigning it in, significantly.  
And btw…. no one is taking away your birth control. We just don’t like our tax money funding it, and we will rescind Roe v Wade, because there are too many alternatives for birth control today than there was back when the law was enacted.  Abortion is not an acceptable for of birth control. Take control of your body, as you folks have protested about on Saturday. Don’t make your boyfriends nor the government pay for your lask of being in control of your body by allowing yourself to get pregnant. You want to be an adult? Act like one.

On Jan. 10, USC became a smoke-free campus. This policy shift resulted in a ban of all smokable tobacco products, electronic cigarettes and hookahs. The initiative marks a step forward to maintaining a healthier campus environment. This policy should be a first step toward ushering in more comprehensive public health measures.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
USC is one of about 1,700 campuses to go smoke-free and one of only 110 to completely ban smokable tobacco-based products, e-cigarettes and hookahs. These numbers have grown significantly over the past years, as national public health initiatives sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and private organizations have brought awareness to the issue of student health on college campuses.
Ending smoking on campus is crucial to improving the health of students, faculty and staff. After all, the University of Vermont went smoke-free in August 2015, and the biggest change reported was the decrease in the number of freshman smokers. Underclassmen tend to seek to fit in with their older peers and can overestimate the number of smokers around them. Thus, some are inadvertently pressured into smoking, and the cycle continues with the next generation of freshmen. By ending smoking on campus, USC students — especially younger ones — will be less likely to start smoking. USC is also protecting all students as a whole from exposure to secondhand smoke, a Class A carcinogen, and reducing the fire risk in residence halls and buildings, as well as expenses related to smoke damage and cigarette litter.
Protecting students from the many negative health and environmental detriments of smoking is an important administrative move. Additionally, the school has provided a myriad of resources for students and faculty who want to quit or limit their smoking. The Engemann Student Health Center offers one-on-one consultations and smoking cessation support for students and faculty. These resources show that the University is working to consider and address the needs of smokers and non-smokers alike.
The policy is not perfect. It will be difficult to enforce and will most likely take a few years before the benefits become fully apparent. However, it is a necessary first step.
USC’s smoke-free policy is just the first of hopefully many steps to improve the campus living standard. To build off this progress in the next few years, USC should consider implementing the Partnership for a Healthier America, an organization with the goal of furthering healthy living and eating on campus to improve the well-being and health of the University’s staff, students and faculty.
A Healthier America is currently partnered with 44 universities, including the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University. The program uses nutrition research at partner schools as well as the organization’s own research to promote healthy living on college campuses by encouraging physical activity and mental health management. This partnership could help students become more aware of what they are eating and how to take care of their bodies, while also serving as a complement to the Mindful USC program, which promotes and offers resources for advancing mindfulness and mental health.
It is the responsibility of the University to pass public health measures in order to protect the well-being of its students, who are already burdened with academic and social stressors. Every student has the right to make their own individual choices regarding their health, but when behaviors negatively affect others in their community, the administration has not only the right but also the obligation to pass appropriate public health measures to protect the physical and mental health of the USC student body and faculty.
Has smoking weed been banned as well? It should be, if you want to hold true to the “smoke free university ” rule.

As a coffee enthusiast, I find myself traversing Los Angeles in search of a coffee shop that satisfies my taste buds, as well as aesthetic needs. Situated in Eagle Rock, California, Found Coffee opened its gates to a caffeinated promise land. 
The abundance of succulents and carrera marble countertops transported me to realm of endless Pinterest boards.The exposed wooden ceiling beams and light fixtures added a sense of warmth and texture to the space. As soft rock played in the background, customers seemed enraptured by their novels. With these Barnes & Noble enthusiasts, I quickly felt at home at Found Coffee.  
Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by an exuberant barista, who promptly asked for my order. Three must-have drinks were strongly recommended: a vanilla latte, a mocha and a chai latte. 
Lara Sassounian | Daily Trojan
The vanilla latte had the soothing effect of a warm hug on a cold winter’s day. The vanilla and espresso shot were perfectly balanced, as well as a sweet raisin aftertaste. This vanilla latte was one of the most delicious lattes I have ever had, and would surely order again. 
The mocha had dark chocolate and woody undertones that can best be described as, “a grownup hot chocolate.” This satisfying drink was definitely the heaviest of the three, as well as the most rewarding to drink.

Lastly, the chai latte was the embodiment of everyone’s favorite Christmas candle. Initially sweet, the spicy cinnamon adds a deeper flavor profile. 
On its website, Found Coffee describes itself as “a gathering place for Angelenos to enjoy specialty coffee, tea, pastries and each other’s company.” Found Coffee delivers on its promise and executes drinks that comfort and soothe. Good coffee is not only about taste. Rather, truly good coffee leaves the consumer with a smile.

Now that the new semester is well and truly in full swing (midterms, what?), getting a grip on your health and fitness goals is becoming increasingly a priority. Whether your goals for the semester are to lose those last 10 pounds, get fit, run a half-marathon or simply feel better in your own skin, you need a plan.
Without a plan, it’s easy for your goals to slip out of your mind as you become overwhelmed with work and social outings, and one day here and there becomes every day, which becomes your habit, routine and reality.
The most important steps to take in order to plan out your week, inclusive of your health and fitness goals, and then follow it over and over and over until you don’t even have to think about it!
Secondly, the law of attraction. This law is vastly complicated and far too lengthy for me to explain here in this article (although I highly recommend looking into it), however, on a fundamental scale, this is what I mean: If you act like you’re already living the life of your dreams, you will. It’s that simple. If you are grateful for everything you have and are, and you live each day with the positivity, productivity and passion that you foresee in your future life (be this when you’ve lost the weight, got the abs or cut out the junk food), then your future life will become your reality. 
Remember that what you do day in and day out directly and unequivocally determines who you are and how you feel. It is your decision to feel happy, successful, fit and healthy — but you have to truly, actively, entirely decide to believe in you.

If you asked me what the best part of my weekend was, I would definitely say it was my experience at Zinc Café & Market, and not just because I was seated three feet away from actor James Franco. Located on Mateo Street in the up and coming Arts District, Zinc is the perfect spot for a delicious and healthy lunch. The cafe has a few different sections: a dine-in seating area with indoor and outdoor seating, a salad bar and a small marketplace. The salad bar offers delicious and healthy options, from the avocado toast with a balsamic reduction to the Mexican chopped couscous salad. Open on weekdays only, the salad bar is your best bet for quick service and yummy, fresh foods. You can stack up as many different salads as you want all for $12.50 per pound.
As I wanted a bit of a heartier lunch, I opted for the regular lunch menu. The menu offers a range of unique wood fired pizzas, veggie burgers, pasta, salads, sandwiches and more! It is a relatively small menu but somehow I struggled for a while to decide what to order as everything sounded delicious. I decided upon the vegetarian sausage and fennel pizza and opted to swap the usual fontina cheese topping for vegan cheese. My friend, Anna, ordered one of the classic Zinc veggie burgers which came with roasted peppers and melted brie cheese.
After the first bite, I knew I had to come back to Zinc as soon as possible. The pizza crust was thin and crispy yet not burnt, and the combination of the cheese, sausage, and savory, crunchy fennel was blissful. Anna’s veggie burger was roughly the size of her face, oozing with melted brie. Needless to say, we both cleaned our plates completely.
In addition to their delicious lunch menu and salad bar, there is also a dinner, dessert and cocktail menu featuring cocktails from Zinc’s own Bar Mateo, located just next door. Zinc also boasts a small mini-mart inside, where they sell gourmet Italian sodas, kombucha, and little munchies and candies. Zinc is the perfect spot to take your picky mom out to lunch, to go with your roommates or to go by yourself. While it may seem out of the limelight, watch out for celebrities when you go. I was seated next to James Franco and was definitely not cool about it.
