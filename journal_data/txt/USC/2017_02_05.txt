USC’s Undergraduate Student Government oversees a budget of approximately $2.3 million each year. The official governing body for 19,000 students, comprised of six branches and more than 120 members, holds tremendous influence over numerous aspects of campus life. During the past two academic years, USG has negotiated legislation to ban smoking on campus, extend the add/drop deadline for classes and partner with Uber to provide students with free rides.
In last year’s USG elections, only 3,162 students cast ballots — a measly 19 percent of the eligible voting population. Why do so few students seem to care about a governing system with such sway over their undergraduate experience? Our staff at the Daily Trojan sought to examine this and other pressing questions about civic engagement, political persuasion and diversity in student government at USC.
Could our governing structure be in need of a dramatic overhaul? We sought input on this question from our crosstown rival UCLA, a campus where student government politics far exceed ours in both intensity and vigor. Our lead story compares USC’s senatorial government with UCLA’s highly competitive slate system, exploring the pros and cons of each approach.
We went back in USG history for a timeline documenting President Edwin Saucedo’s administration, along with a story exploring the greek community’s significant role in elections. Despite USC’s long history of electing fraternity men to the highest position in student government, this trend has been on the decline as of late.
In the spirit of transparency and open understanding of politics, we wanted to find out what goes on behind the scenes of a successful presidential campaign. This curiosity inspired us to profile the campaign managers behind the three presidential tickets currently running for office. What we discovered was the passion that these students demonstrate for the candidates they represent, and the amount of work they are willing to dedicate to help the rest of the student body feel the same way.
Though students arguably are well aware of the impact that USG can have on their experience, many are unclear about the role of another organization: Graduate Student Government, the body that represents graduate students at USC. We spoke to GSG members to better understand the way this group works, and in the process found that one group of GSG constituents feels disconnected: students studying, working and living on the Health Sciences Campus. Our article explores how GSG representatives studying in the Keck School of Medicine of USC are working to help Keck students feel more in touch with the government that represents them.
At a highly consequential time in national politics, students must learn to exercise effective civic participation at the university level. We hope the stories in this issue inspire you to discover the power of governance in our own backyard.

To date, this has been the most  contentious opinion piece by the Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board. We extensively interviewed each ticket for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president, deliberated for hours and finally overcame a stiff gridlock in the editorial decision about which ticket best represents what we want to see in our student government. So this is by no means an easy endorsement to write. 
We strongly believe that all three tickets running to be USG president and vice president are extraordinary campus leaders, have a wealth of experience and encompass what it means to be a student at USC. However, we believe that next year’s USG president and vice president should be Rachel Udabe and Rebecca Harbeck.
Last year, USG voter turnout dropped 39 percent. At a time in which national activism is at a crucial high, student involvement is at a crucial low. We have turned our tide from the energy and passion of administrations of past years to complacency and inactivity. Passion in students is there, but we need the right leaders to inspire it.
That is why we want to see change in USG. That is why we believe Udabe and Harbeck will bring the organization the fresh perspective it needs to ultimately change the trajectory of our campus’ political culture.
Transparency and accessibility are crucial issues not only within USC administration, but also within Undergraduate Student Government itself. Too many students feel disconnected with their campus representatives, are apathetic toward student government and lack awareness regarding the progress of administration initiatives and the part that they can play in the solution. 
It’s true that all three tickets mentioned transparency in one form or another in their platforms. But we liked Udabe and Harbeck’s position on accessible external office hours for USG members. More than that, we thought that their diverse experiences and status as USG outsiders will open up USG to all students and transform USG into a more student-centered, activist organization — into what student government entails on many other college campuses.
Despite slow progress, pressing concerns including health services, sustainability, tuition rises, sexual assault, cultural expression and community inclusion still persist. With the advent of the Trump administration, many students worry about the impact of national policies and rhetoric and question how they can stand up for what they believe in. In the midst of these challenges, we believe Udabe and Harbeck can indeed, like their campaign promises, unite, strengthen and connect our campus.
With backgrounds as Orientation Advisors, Residential Assistants, tour guides and student workers at the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, Udabe and Harbeck know diverse aspects of their community well. These experiences and perspectives will elevate diverse voices and issues and allow USG to formulate policy that works for all students. 
Moreover, at a time when greek life and sports often dominate the campus conversation, Udabe and Harbeck’s emphasis on supporting spring admits and transfer and international students through a mentorship program will ensure that some of the most forgotten populations of campus will have their voices heard.
But Udabe and Harbeck must take crucial steps in order to become effective leaders in USG. They face a steep learning curve. They must revise their platform points, some of which are infeasible and reflect a lack of deep research and understanding of policymaking at USC. The candidates must do better to incorporate those who do have the institutional knowledge about what USG can and cannot do. The candidates must use the next three months to immerse themselves in the ins and outs of student government and continue to gain greater knowledge of campus issues and solutions if they hope to hit the ground running in August.
They have great colleagues in their competitors. They should look to their opponents Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan for their experience in USG and in policymaking hand-in-hand with the administration. They should look to their other opponents Daniel Million and Tim Vorhoff for innovative ideas, like the reassessing of the black house initiative and creation of a multicultural house to foster inclusion. In order to be the most effective leaders they can be, they will need to understand their shortcomings and work alongside their colleagues.
Our hope is that Udabe and Harbeck will meet our vision, but the Daily Trojan will, as it has done in the past for every administration, continue to hold them accountable for providing the transformative leadership they have promised.
We would be remiss if we did not note the symbolic significance of electing two women of color who have lived much of their USC career outside of the USG bureaucracy to the highest student-occupied office at USC. We are sending the message that we continue to embrace diverse leaders — in more ways than one — and that we continue to recognize their unique contributions to our campus.
If we want change on our campus, we need to elect the changemakers. That’s why we are supporting the Rachel and Rebecca ticket for USG.

So despite inexperience, the endorsement is mostly based on “fresh perspective”?

A large crowd congregates in the center of UCLA. It’s early May, and emotions run high as the campaign season for Undergraduate Students Association Council elections draws to a close. Students wait in suspense for the announcements of the results for council positions. One group of students, donning Bruins United shirts, cheer with glee, unable to hide their visceral excitement. Others wipe away tears and exchange conciliatory embraces.
Welcome to campus politics at UCLA, where student government’s identity runs strong in the form of a party system. These student political parties, called slates, have dominated the UCLA political sphere with their decades-long roots. Last year, Danny Siegel, the current president of USAC, the UCLA equivalent of Undergraduate Student Government, clinched the presidency with more than 10 percent of the vote in an environment that he said fosters intense competition.
“The way that elections work at UCLA can make them a very high-stress situation,” Siegel said. “You want to be promoting your candidacy and your slate to as many students as possible, under fast-paced, well-regulated conditions. Every vote counts, so you really want to make your case to anyone willing to listen.”
Siegel represented the Bruins United slate, a juggernaut party that swept nine out of 13 council positions in addition to the presidency last year. The slate formed in 2004 as a conglomeration of different groups on campus — Bruin Democrats, Bruin Republicans, various Greek organizations and Jewish students. Since its inception, Bruins United has remained a stalwart in USAC, though it has been challenged by other slates, most recently by Waves of Change.
“In the process of trying to reach as many students as possible on campus, I would say that the slate system creates more competition, especially at UCLA,” Siegel said. “It’s so ingrained in our system, and it just makes sense to have people who want to champion the same values as you. They’re your governing coalition, and you’ll work together on different projects, advocacy efforts and go to our weekly council meetings and support each other’s initiatives.”
Comparatively, the fervor for campus politics at USC seems tepid. Last year, in the USG elections, less than 20 percent of voters — down 39 percent from the previous year — cast ballots for their student representatives. If voter turnout is any indication for student engagement on campus, adopting a slate system is a possible remedy, according to USAC External Vice President Rafael Sands.
“I’m surprised it hasn’t happened yet at USC,” Sands said. “When a lot of students get together, they should realize that simply by partnering up and building a coalition around shared values, they will able to reach a lot more students.”
USG President Edwin Saucedo isn’t completely convinced that USC should embrace a slate system. According to Saucedo, slate systems, with clearly delineated allegiances, bar outsiders from entering student government.
“I think it’s a bit of an unfair system because with such deep party establishments, it creates barriers for people who want to be involved with student government to come in. If you look at Bruins United, it has been relatively uncontested for so long,” Saucedo said. “Whereas this year, in the USG elections, we have a ticket with no USG experience, but that doesn’t create a barrier for their race.”
Plus, as Saucedo points out, recent changes to the USG elections system have allowed more students to run.
“Last year we switched from having constituencies for senators to just being anyone can run for any office,” Saucedo said. “There’s no greek, commuter or residential [constituencies anymore].”
The USG system now features the election of independent tickets and 12 senatorial candidates every year. For USG president and vice president tickets, Saucedo thinks that election season allows candidates to collaborate with their running mates on platform points.
“As the presidential ticket, you’re running with a vice president candidate that you’ve hand-picked,” Saucedo said. “When you pick this person, it means you’re willing to work with them, and you’re setting up both of your successes.” 
But former USG President Rini Sampath points out that a slate system could help students finance their campaigns, which is an important aspect of running for office. 
“At USC, we’ve created a reimbursement system personally,” Sampath said. “It ended up costing us a lot of money for student government when one of the tickets backed out after we had already funded their campaign. You don’t want finances to hold any students back, and that’s why political parties and slate systems are able to fundraise and raise money in order for them to run an effective campaign.”
She also thought that the slate system had some other upsides. According to Sampath, from the USC lens, political ties could be a contributing factor to the level of engagement in UCLA campus politics.
“Maybe, political parties on these campuses are able to reach students at that level — at that visceral level — and bring students to vote,” Sampath said. “There’s also, of course, to some extent, loyalty to a certain side.”
Though Sampath sees drawbacks, she thinks that the slate system could motivate long-term interest in student politics.
“I think that if we were able to create some kind of foundation of knowledge to be passed on each year, that’d be great,” Sampath said. “It would actually create an even playing field and let everyone have a shot to run for president.”
In addition to passing on knowledge from one incumbent to another, Siegel said the slate system increased responsibility for elected leaders, holding them accountable to meet all of their platform points.
“The other party will like to try to hold those who won accountable,” Siegel said. “Because when you’re in the opposition, you want to magnify it and amplify it to boost your chances in the next election cycle, which is just a normal part of politics.”
But Siegel and Sands also acknowledged flaws in the USAC government system. According to Sands, slates create polarization and may not engage everyone on campus.
“It’s surely not perfect, and it’s very hard to get all the students involved,” Sands said. “But I think the nature of having a student government with a competitive environment is people challenging others to come up with better ideas and prove themselves.” 
Hahney Yo, director of finance and administration of Program Board, has recently modified the current USG structure to improve the way the organization is run.
“The new structure would help aid USG transparency and increase internal communication with everyone,” Yo said. “That’s the problem USG has faced for so long, because if you think about it, the top manages 120 people.”
Yo proposed a restructuring of leadership within the five branches of USG. The potential new USG structure would see the chief of staff champion the advocacy branch, allowing the president and vice president to focus more on their own initiatives.
“It won’t ever be perfect, but I don’t think any form of government will ever be perfect,” Yo said. “We can only ever work on creating better systems as we see things work and not work each year.”

When Mikey Geragos announced his candidacy for Undergraduate Student Government president in 2012, his Sigma Chi fraternity brothers knew what to do. The freshmen pledges volunteered to distribute flyers on Trousdale Parkway. Many brothers committed to supporting the campaign on social media, or showed up to cheer for Geragos at debates. 
“It was like a routine,” Geragos said of the coordinated response. 
Raised by a family of proud Trojans, Geragos attended his first football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum when he was just a toddler. From the moment he stepped onto campus as a USC freshman, the affable Pasadena native knew he wanted to lead the University he had grown to love. His fraternity’s strong legacy of leadership gave him the added confidence — and strategic advantage — to pursue his dream. 
“I had resources immediately that I don’t know how I would’ve gotten if I wasn’t in greek life,” Geragos said. 
The greek system has long exercised a significant role in student government at USC. With historically low rates of voter turnout for USG elections, sororities and fraternities represent a major voting bloc — one that candidates must capitalize on to win. 
It comes as no surprise, then, that seven of the past 10 student body presidents have held fraternity affiliations. Four presidents came from Sigma Chi, an unofficial student government powerhouse. 
Geragos, who won the 2012 election with 2,376 votes, cited manpower and name recognition as the primary strategic benefits of his involvement in the greek community. 
“It comes down to how many people know your name,” Geragos said. “Socially, when you’re in a greek organization, on average, you’re probably interacting with more people.” 
In recent years, USG has attempted to mitigate the influence of the greek community in elections by increasing overall voter turnout. Kat Lee, associate director of elections, said more students would participate if they appreciated just how much USG shapes their undergraduate experience. 
“I don’t think people realize the impact that USG can have on the student body,” Lee said. 
Lee referenced the extension of the drop deadline for classes and the University’s partnership with Uber, as meaningful changes negotiated by USG. By informing more students about these advocacy initiatives — through holding external office hours on Trousdale and developing an aggressive social media marketing campaign — she hopes to make policy, rather than popularity, the central focus of elections. 
“I think for candidates to be successful, they really need to appeal to a huge, diverse crowd,” Lee said. “The key to winning isn’t just winning over the greek Row.” 
Rini Sampath’s 2015 USG victory provides compelling support for Lee’s argument. With 3,906 votes, Sampath and her running mate Jordan Fowler became the first all-female ticket elected in USC history. Among other notable accomplishments, Sampath’s trailblazing presidency bucked a long tradition of greek dominance at the highest levels of student leadership, paving the way for current USG President Edwin Saucedo. 
While Sampath did not belong to a sorority, USG Senator Paul Samaha said she leveraged her close relationships with the greek community to win the election. 
“Rini showed that you don’t necessarily have to be greek to win, as long as you have ties to the system,” said Samaha, who worked as director of communications for the campaign. 
Although Geragos used his fraternity ties to secure votes, once elected, he shifted his focus to advocate on behalf of the entire student body. 
“I got a lot of requests from my friends in the greek community who were unhappy with what the administration was doing,” Geragos said. “I didn’t see going after that as a priority. I saw that as the Interfraternity Council’s priority.” 
Presidential candidate and current USG Vice President Austin Dunn, a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, echoed this sentiment. Dunn said his greek affiliations would not hinder him from effectively representing the interests of the broader campus. 
“The reality of the situation is, the constituency that we advocate the least for is the greek community. That doesn’t necessarily mean that they have everything they need, but we work on a need basis,” Dunn said. “We ask students what needs to be changed on campus. And those changes are not primarily from the greek community.”

When second-year medical student Ali Tafreshi sits with his fellow senators at the Graduate Student Government meeting each month, one thing sets him apart from almost everyone else in the room: He’s wearing a white lab coat over his button-down and slacks.
Tafreshi, who also serves as the student body president of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, is one of five GSG senators from Keck. Together, they are responsible for representing 1,200 medical, master’s in public health and Ph.D. students who call Keck home — a task that Tafreshi says is difficult because of the disconnect between the Health Sciences Campus and GSG. Burdened with classes and work, physically separated from the University Park Campus and often overlooked for programs and social events, many Keck students feel isolated from the governing body that represents them, an issue that Tafreshi says prevents them from taking full advantage of everything it has to offer. He and other Keck students involved in GSG agree that while the organization is making an effort to reach out to members of the HSC community, there is still work to be done before students on both campuses feel like they are represented equally. 
“[GSG] seems like something that was not meant for us,” Tafreshi said. “There’s all of these law students, business students, Ph.D. students that are involved with it and it’s right next to them, and it seems like [Keck students] are an afterthought to that.”
Tafreshi said that when he first came to USC as a medical student, he knew that GSG must be important — but he never learned anything about it formally and never heard anyone talking about it around campus. After conducting research online, however, he realized the full scope of what GSG could do — and wanted to help other students realize this as well. 
“There is a disconnect between funding we receive from GSG and involvement in GSG,” Tafreshi said. “Most people’s involvement with GSG seems to be applying for funding … and nothing beyond that. They seem to understand how to ask for money, but it’s like a black hole — you don’t know what GSG is, you don’t know how anything is run, you don’t know how the finance committee runs, but you may or may not get your money and then you don’t ask questions after that.” 
Tafreshi explained that part of this lack of understanding came from the amount of work that Keck students had, including classes, internships and clinical hours that prevent many from reaching out to organizations like GSG that aren’t immediately accessible from their campus. Sydney O’Connor, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in health behavior research who also serves on the GSG Executive Board as the HSC director of operations, said that Keck students were too far from the UPC-based GSG. 
“Students throughout the year have voiced that they feel that being at the Health Sciences Campus can be isolating,” O’Connor said. “A lot of the time, major events and social programming are held at the University Park Campus, like tailgates and Springfest. It can feel very far away from us.” 
O’Connor explained that she and other GSG representatives from Keck are trying to bridge that gap, and she believes they have succeeded in improving HSC’s connection to GSG over the past few semesters. New programming like HSC tailgates, increased student representation through the HSC Concerns Committee and greater efforts to connect HSC students to UPC resources have helped many Keck students feel like GSG is an active presence on campus, O’Connor said. Colleen Garvey, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Keck’s cancer biology and genomics program and a first-year GSG senator, added that both campuses have worked together to make students more aware of what their student government can do for them.
“People have been more vocal and taken the initiative to try to make it more inclusive,” Garvey said. “The communication has been huge — letting people know about the resources they have and the events that are going on.”
However, O’Connor said that GSG can do more to bring resources to HSC — but it needs the help of UPC students and the recognition that Keck may require more attention because of its distance. Bringing UPC resources such as therapy dogs and safety personnel to HSC, O’Connor said, would go a long way toward helping students there gain a greater appreciation for what GSG can offer. 
“One of our goals is to bring all the resources and excitement that are available at UPC to HSC students,” O’Connor said. “We also want to encourage HSC students to actually travel to events taking place at UPC or at other locations around L.A. to meet students that they wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to meet. We’re in a position as HSC GSG members where we are more aware of the resources that are available and who we can reach out to for specific requests, and we’re able to connect students to those individuals.”

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanFriendship promises · Hashim Osman, a junior majoring in business administration, assumed the role of campaign manager in the Million-Vorhoff campaign in late fall 2016. Prior to the election, Osman was Daniel Million’s freshman year roommate.
When Hashim Osman accepted the offer to serve as campaign manager for the Million-Vorhoff ticket, he knew he needed to emphasize the vision his candidates stood for: change.
Similar to Osman, Paul Breslin and Rachel Krusenoski both recognized striking qualities in their candidates — qualities that inspired them to dedicate countless hours to a role often overlooked by the student body.
As campaign managers, they proudly stand in the shadows of their candidates, advocating for the changes they so strongly believe their tickets could bring to USC’s student government and its constituents. 
“[Austin and Morgan] both really want USC to reach that progress that has been lacking in the past few years,” said Breslin, the campaign manager of the Austin-Morgan ticket. 
The process of building a campaign is not an easy task — and student-run elections on college campuses across the nation are no exception. Historically, campaign managers have played a vital role in the success of Undergraduate Student Government elections. From arranging endorsement meetings to developing campaign strategies, these individuals provide a foundation of stability and organization needed to orchestrate a hectic two-week campaign. 
For them, planning is everything. USG campaign managers must effectively strategize and communicate their candidates’ platforms within a brief two-week period in accordance with University election policies. Nevertheless, their work is not solely reflected in these short two weeks.
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanA seasoned veteran · Rachel Krusenoski, a sopohmore majoring in policy, planning and development, serves as the campaign manager for the Rachel-Rebecca ticket. She previously ran a senatorial campaign.
Weeks or even months before a campaign is announced, the candidates, campaign managers and core team work to plan every detail — from the ticket’s campus outreach approach to the color scheme of their branding. Krusenoski, the creative mind behind the Rachel-Rebecca ticket, worked personally with Udabe and Harbeck to develop the foundation of their campaign, contributing hours prior to the announcement on Jan. 26 to strategize their communication plan.
Krusenoski is no stranger to the USG election process. In 2016, she was the campaign manager for Tingyee Chang and Alanna Schenck’s senatorial race. Having run a successful ticket as a freshman, Krusenoski was confident that she could build a strong campaign for Udabe and Harbeck, who both have no experience in USG. And approachability became the first method she used to do so.
“Our campaign provides a rawness and personality so that voters know who Rachel and Rebecca are,” she said. “We wanted to show that they have personality, quirks and experience in different areas. The student body and our supporters really deserve to know that side of them.”
Though each campaign has its own dynamic, they all hold one common goal: appealing to USC’s diverse student body. Student engagement and voter turnout have seen a significant drop in past elections, but Osman hopes the Million-Vorhoff ticket could engage students, especially those who have felt institutionally neglected, in the voting process. 
“We really believe in the power of sharing your story,” Osman said. “Both of the candidates, Daniel and Tim, have compelling stories.” 
As a close friend of Million, the presidential candidate, Osman is able to gain insight into his candidate’s personality and believes that Million’s message would resonate with the student body. 
“Daniel [Million] — he’s experienced a lot and his background is just an intriguing story,” he said. 
Fourteen days is a short period of time to effectively reach 19,000 undergraduates. Many candidates rely on endorsements from organizations or influential student leaders to boost their campaign presence throughout campus and on social media. Breslin described the tedious process behind receiving endorsements. 
“We are trying to reach almost every single group posted on USC’s student organization website,” he said. “We’re trying to reach all 900 clubs we have here at USC because we really do want to hear the Trojan voice.” 
Breslin also underscored the importance of creating a strong brand image to resonate with and appeal to students. 
“Our graphics and our signage … are very clean and classic. It looks like a very nice political campaign,” he said. “Our graphic designer, Sarah Allen, is the perfect candidate for this because she has worked on so many different programs here at USC.”
Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanRunning the show · Paul Breslin, a junior majoring in health and human sciences, serves as the campaign manager for the Austin-Morgan ticket. Breslin met Morgan Monahan through Society 53.
Beyond the surface-level details of campaign work, these three individuals have gained more than just the experience of organizing and planning campaigns. After months of preparation and weeks of communication to reach USC’s student body, Osman, Breslin and Krusenoski have all discovered fresh perspectives on work ethic, group collaboration and the election process itself.
When Osman accepted his role as campaign manager, he knew he was in for an arduous journey to help his candidates achieve their goal.
“Nobody knew exactly what we were getting ourselves into, since no one has been through a presidential campaign before,” Osman said. “Everyone knew it was going to be difficult and that we were going to have things we didn’t expect pop up.” 
Despite the difficulties, the campaign managers have also reaped invaluable rewards. 
Since becoming Austin Dunn and Morgan Monahan’s campaign manager, Breslin developed a stronger friendship with Dunn and a desire to become more involved in student government. 
“This has been one of the best experiences I’ve had at USC,” Breslin said. “I honestly do think that if Austin and Morgan get elected, they will change the program for the better and make it something I want to be in. 
And for Krusenoski, the Rachel-Rebecca ticket marked only the beginning of the change that she knows she will see in the future for all students at USC.
“It’s bigger than a campaign, and it’s bigger than social media. It is a chance we have to leave an impact, to bring something new to the table and to bring your voices to the table,” Krusenoski said. “It’s so much bigger than me or Rebecca or Rachel — it is a movement to fight the good fight.”

With campaign posters scattered around the grassy lawn on Trousdale Parkway and social media campaigns dominating Facebook feeds, most students know that it’s the time of year again — the elections for Undergraduate Student Government. 
Last year, Edwin Saucedo and Austin Dunn were voted into office with almost two-thirds of the vote of the USC student body. However, only 3,700  voted — a small fraction of the almost 19,000 undergraduate students on campus.
From on-campus protests and prayer events, student activism is increasing in light of the recent political climate. However, this increased activism might not be able to solve the political apathy on campus or translate into voter engagement. 
Some students believe that the elections do not have an impact them directly. Angie Kim, a sophomore majoring in occupational science, has never voted in the election and does not plan to. She said the lack of information about what USG does makes voting a non-priority for her.
“There isn’t a big enough presence or visibility of USG on campus for me to be concerned about who’s in it,” Kim said. “How do I know from their campaign that they would support the things I want? Because everyone just pretty much says the same thing like, ‘We want your voice to be heard,’ but don’t really do anything about that.”
Morgan Spencer, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she will vote in the election, but she does not feel many changes will be made.
“I don’t think the administration listens to students anyway,” Spencer said. “It seems like most of the measures they push are not granted, or are granted in such a way that will appease the irritation of the student body but not actually address the issues to make real change.”
Spencer commented on her perception of the role USG plays in the student body, or lack thereof.
“USG is not doing work that affects me or my peers, but even if they are, we’re not aware of it,” Spencer said. “If I knew what they did, then maybe I would care more.”
While the number of voters for the USG elections rose from 30 percent to 32 percent in 2015, last year showed yet another low turnout.
Aaron Ashby, a senior studying film production, said that many people do not vote because they are too involved in their personal and professional lives. However, Ashby recognizes the importance of voting.
“USG has a huge impact in our daily lives as charges. The resolutions that they pass, like being a sanctuary campus, directly affect our lifestyle,” Ashby said. “I want to make sure that the people who represent my values are represented in the Senate and in all the offices of the USG.” 
The problem may be due to the truncated campaign time in the USG election that started last year. Since then, the amount of time that candidates are allowed to campaign decreased by a week — from three weeks to only two weeks. However, USG elections commission maintained the same two-week campaign period this past year. 
Donielle Bunyard, assistant director of elections, said there are a few reasons why students may not engage with USG.
“The first thing that comes to mind is a lack of understanding of what USG is and does,” Bunyard said. “Many students may not connect projects like USC Uber or establishing USC as a smoke-free campus to the work of USG members.”
Bunyard said that despite the fact that USG members hold weekly office hours and are elected or hired to advocate for the student voice, the student body at large does not see USG as a real resource they can utilize.
“Voter turnout is also in some ways a result of how visible candidates are in any given year,” Bunyard said. “But this year, the candidates have very strong networks and are working hard to mobilize those networks both on social media and Trousdale.”
In efforts to promote the election and maintain voter turnout, USG continued their a social media campaign, “Vote On!” and worked with Annenberg Media to organize a live debate at Wallis Annenberg Hall, with an incentive to vote by offering a raffle for Air + Style tickets or a credit with ZipCar.
As USG moves to another election cycle, many students wonder whether there will be changes and greater efforts made toward making changes to improve voter engagement. 
When asked how she thinks the voting will play out, Bunyard said that despite the elections this year, she hopes that the ultimate takeaway is for all the candidates to continue to be engaged with USG.
“I would hope that those candidates who are not elected would find an alternative route to create change on our campus,” Bunyard said. “It would be a shame for the election to dim the passion of any candidate.”

On what would otherwise have been a sleepy Friday morning at the University of Southern California, freshman Alec Vandenberg addressed a crowd of nearly 100 students congregated in front of Tommy Trojan to protest Donald Trump’s recent executive order limiting Muslim immigration.
The speech was no more than 30 seconds, encouraging the assembled to canvas and contact their local representatives, but concluded with a sentiment that largely resounded with an audience demanding national change.
“Student apathy ends now!” he yelled through a handed off megaphone at the Feb. 3 rally. “And student activism starts now!”
The crowd roared.
On a campus historically known much less for political activism than its University of California brethren, the election of President Donald Trump has set off a fervor among students and faculty alike that many argue hasn’t been seen in a generation.
“In talking with professors who have been here a while, they’ll tell you you would have never seen protests in front of Tommy Trojan on a rainy Friday morning,” said Jacob Lind, a freshman majoring in English literature.
In the days following Trump’s inauguration, a similar crowd to Friday’s stood in the rain outside the Von Kleinsmid Center in protest of the event. Just a few weeks later, nearly a dozen USC-related rallies and protests have touched the campus community. All have been in unity against one opposing force: their elected president.
“When Trump won election night, at the drop of a hat everything changed,” Lind said.  “It was like the entire campus flipped a switch and started caring a lot more about politics.”
It is newfound territory for a generation that has largely grown up under the auspices of a Democratic administration. 
At both USC and campuses nationwide, the post-election energy of college students is being compared to what occurred during the Vietnam War. Like Trump’s election, the bloody conflict in Southeast Asia — which saw fellow classmates being drafted off to fight a far-off war in the dozens — lit a fire in students’ hearts even at this University. 
If one were to visit USC in mid-May 1970, they would find a starkly different political atmosphere than the one they may be used to. President Richard Nixon had just announced plans to invade Cambodia, amping up a war that many University members already vehemently opposed.
In response to widespread requests among students and faculty alike, the administration called off all classes and normal business for four days of campus protest and peaceful demonstration called the “Days of Concern.”
Students read about the Days of Concern in the Daily Trojan, May 1970.
The Daily Trojan at the time dubbed it as “the most significant day in the history of the University of Southern California.” Nearly 1,500 students, faculty and administrators packed into Alumni Park to hear strike speeches. Faculty kept their doors open to facilitate cross-generational discussion. One student at the time wrote they were transformed from an apolitical bystander to an involved member of the political process. 
“Last week I was the average apathetic USC student who lived day to day and didn’t give a damn about what was going on outside my own little world. I always felt that other people would take care of things,” they wrote. “Then, little by little, I realized that the government wasn’t as pure as I had thought… something snapped. I didn’t feel I could take other people’s word on things that I didn’t know about myself. I began to look into things for myself for the first time in my life.” 
The emotions were largely similar to those of many USC students today. 
Joe Harlan, a junior majoring in theater, is one of the many students who could be seen as a modern reincarnation of sentiments like the aforementioned — that of a newfound lack of faith in government. One of many invigorated after Trump’s election to immerse themselves in the political process, his first opportunity was the Women’s March in downtown Los Angeles, walking alongside more than 750,000 fellow demonstrators, 
“It was the first time I put my body and my feet where my mouth was,” Harlan said. “Before I had been very politically aware, but this was the first time I was angry and scared. And not for myself — I’m a white suburban male. But it’s not about me, it’s about other people.”
Whereas in Vietnam the unifying fear was friends and family being sent to war, today students fear for the deportation of international classmates, or the trouncing of rights largely fought for in decades prior. 
“I think we’re going back to political awareness rather than political complacency,” Harlan said. “With this election, I’ve seen everyone talking about it.” 
Some students now are hoping to turn that talk into effective action. Lind, alongside Vandenberg and another classmate — all freshmen — founded Trojan Advocates for Political Progress just this semester as an outlet for students’ newfound desire to get involved.
While they laud the energy and momentum behind widespread rallies, the group advocates more for less fashionable methods of joining the political process, such as calling your local representative.
“The only way to change our policies we think are unjust is to get involved in the nitty-gritty aspects of politics,” said Vandenberg, who is also a writer for the Daily Trojan. “It’s not the glitz and glamor of rallies always.” 
Students participating in this fresh wave of activism look to merge alongside the small but vocal community that has been fighting for a wide range of issues — ranging from the cessation of USC business ties to Bangladesh sweatshops to the fight for a $15 minimum wage in Los Angeles — long before Trump was in the running. 
The challenge for these more seasoned activists is to find and retain those students who truly want to fight for change, rather than those who may be jumping onto the bandwagon of cliché college protest. 
“I worry that the people who have only recently become politically active will only respond to injustice when it’s smacking them in the face, like with Trump’s immigration ban,” said Sophia Li, a senior majoring in sociology. “Or when it’s fun and trendy to do so, like participate in the Women’s March.”
Nevertheless, Li and others remain optimistic. In a political battle that ultimately benefits more from widespread unity than inner divisiveness, the newfound support is a welcome surprise. 
“It can be frustrating to suddenly see a lot of people who have never organized before only now realize there are problems,” said Nadja Barlera, a senior majoring in English and member of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. “But on the whole, it’s amazing to see so many people come out and support each other.”
Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

Over 200 students gathered in the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom this weekend to learn and engage around issues, practices and possible resources concerning this population at the First-Generation College Student Summit: Path to Success.
This two-day event hosted college students from various university campuses including Loyola Marymount University, Stanford University, San Diego State University and University of California, Irvine. 
Of the undergraduate population at USC, 15 percent are first-generation college students. Because first-generation students often feel unprepared for the obstacles that college brings and cannot turn to their families for advice and counseling on how to maneuver such a complex environment. For this reason, the Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiative decided to start the conference.
Katrina Zimmermann, a USC alumna, has worked in the office for the past few years. She attended the first conference in 2016 and commented on its continued success. 
“We actually received more registrations than we were expecting,” Zimmerman said. “We realized how much of an interest and need there is for first-generation college students to build a community and to reach out to that network and understand what resources are there for them, and to also recognize that they can pridefully stand up and say, ‘I’m a first-generation college student.”
Last year, the Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiative hosted the first First-Generation College Student Summit. It was only a one-day conference, but the positive feedback propelled the Office to expand the length of the event as well as the sessions it included, according to Zimmermann. 
The goal of the conference is to emphasize to students that their accomplishments and resources to go even further. 
“We want them to understand and recognize everything there is to be proud of and how far they were able to come and achieve their acceptance into college.” Zimmermann said. 
Savannah Robinson, a sophomore studying journalism, works in the Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiative with Zimmermann. 
“The Office is incredible because it not only lets students at USC know what resources they have, and what’s accessible to them, but also is very encouraging,” Robinson said. 
Many of the students who are the first generation within their families to attend college come from difficult backgrounds and have had to work extremely hard for their success and accomplishments. 
“A lot of the students come from immigrant family backgrounds where they’ve had to overcome crazy obstacles and have made it into prestigious positions and places in their lives.” Robinson said. 
Felicitas Reyes is a senior majoring in American studies and ethnicity. She commented on the improvement and inclusiveness that the Office has continued to offer to students. 
“I’ve worked for the Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives for the past three years and because of that I’ve been able to really see the inclusive programming for first generation college students on campus,” Reyes said.
There are now even more resources for first generation students. 
“Within the past few years we’ve had a lot of new activities for not only the students but also their parents.” Reyes said. 
The Office also continues to inspire and motivate the students. The University encourages the students and lets them know that any resources they need are available to them. 
“It’s really great that USC does this because it inspires and lets students know that the campus is there for them,” Robinson said.
Aya Almasi, a junior and first geneartion student attending the conference, believed she had gained much insight from everything the event had to offer.
According to Almasi, the Office was very helpful in informing first-generation students of their resources and options. 
“It’s really comforting and motivational to be surrounded by people who know the struggle and have learned different ways to navigate it. Being able to pool that information is extremely beneficial, especially for freshmen and transfer students,” Almasi said.

Over 800 USC students volunteered with Meals 4 Refugees at the Caruso Catholic Center this weekend where they helped pack, sort and organize donations for Syrian refugees. According to the official Facebook event, the organization estimated that they would be able to put together 120,000 meals and 40,000 seed packs. The event was jointly held by Cru and the Global Aid Network. 
Participating student organizations included the USC Ballroom Team, Global Brigades, USC Colleges Against Cancer, Camp Kesem and several Greek organizations.
GAiN provides children and their families with life-saving food packs. For a sustainable food source, GAiN provides a variety of vegetable seed packs to agricultural communities. GAiN works with communities to develop bucket drip-irrigation kits for community and family gardens.
Steve Baker, who worksfor GAiN, was one of the organizers for the event. Baker travels with GAIN, packaging seeds, feminine products and clothes to send to refugees. Baker said he was overwhelmed by the number of volunteers that came out and encouraged students to continue participating in community service, which was planned months in advance.
“People see things on the news all the time and ask the obvious question, ‘What am I supposed to do other than have a strong opinion?’” Baker said. “Here, people feel like, ‘Wow, I’ve done something good,’ and that they have done it with a wide community of folks that [they] might not see eye-to-eye [with] politically, but [can] rally around the fact that there are people in a desperate situation.”

Eliana Velasco, a senior majoring in journalism, volunteered with her sorority Sigma Lambda Gamma and said that helping out at Meals 4 Refugees inspired her to continue working to help refugees.
“This is actually one of the first times that I’ve volunteered at an event like this,” Velasco said. “It’s not enough to share a post on Facebook or tweet a photo and say, ‘This is what’s happening to refugees.’ To actually do the work and help put this food together for people is something really special and it makes me want to do more.”
Milanny Vazquez, a junior majoring in communication management and narrative studies, was also among the volunteers that arrived early Saturday morning. 
“The event was well organized with a clear purpose that shows results,” Vazquez said. “Although my hands began to cramp from repetitive motion, the labor work was well worth the cause, which is to send meals to displaced refugees.”
Nathalye Lopez, a junior majoring in contemporary Latino and Latin American studies and Human Biology, helped package rice and lentils, and found it extremely humbling that such an overwhelming number of people were volunteering.
“I know we are all busy college students but it felt really nice to volunteer,” Lopez said. “It was a great experience and heartwarming knowing that we fed so many people in a span of two hours. Events like these really open your eyes to what it takes to help people in need.”

By With a balanced attack and solid defense between the pipes, the No. 2 women’s water polo team racked up three blowout wins over the weekend to remain undefeated in their 2017 campaign. The Trojans (10-0) secured victories over No. 15 San Diego State, Pomona-Pitzer and Chapman University in less than a 24-hour period, scoring 72 goals and holding their opponents to just nine goals combined. 
In its first game of the year at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center, USC recorded a swift 23-6 victory over the visiting Aztecs. After a 1-1 tie early on, USC raced out to a 15-4 lead by halftime and never looked back. Nine different Trojans would score in the game, led by senior All-American driver Stephania Haralabidis’ five goals and junior utility Annika Jensen’s career-high four goals. In addition, senior two-meter Brigitta Games and freshman utility Maud Megens added hat tricks, while freshman driver Kelsey McIntosh scored the first two goals of her USC career. Defensively, sophomore goalie Amanda Longan recorded 10 saves in the first half, while junior goalie Victoria Chamorro tallied five saves to close out the win.
It would be a quick turnaround the next day as the Trojans traveled over to Whittier, Calif. for a doubleheader at the 2017 Whittier Invitational. In their 9 a.m. tilt against Pomona-Pitzer, USC held the opposition scoreless until the fourth quarter, as Longan completed the game with 11 saves en route to the 25-2 victory. Twelve different Trojans scored against the Sagehens, with junior driver Brianna Daboub and McIntosh leading the way with four goals apiece.
Soon thereafter, USC took on Chapman University and maintained that same scoring prowess, securing a big 24-1 victory over the Panthers. The Trojans scored nine goals and allowed just one in the opening frame, as Chamorro and freshman Holly Parker helped keep Chapman scoreless for the rest of the game. On offense, Games led the team with four goals, while Daboub and Haralabidis added three goals each. Sophomore driver Courtney Fahey, senior two-meter Avery Peterson, senior driver Nikki Stansfield and freshman driver Sawyer Belville all recorded two goals to help the Trojan cause, while freshmen Kaylee Brownsberger, Elise Stein, Denise Mammolito and McIntosh all chipped in one goal to close out the win.
The Trojans will be back in the pool next weekend when they travel down to La Jolla, Calif., to take part in the Triton Invitational. USC opens up competition against Santa Clara on Saturday (Feb. 11), followed by a game against either Hartwick or San Diego State.

Behind a monstrous performance from sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, the Trojans completed a sweep of their Washington road trip as they defeated Washington State 86-77 Saturday night. 
USC (20-4, 7-4) has now won its last four consecutive conference games, the past two being contests on the road up in Washington. 
Metu recorded a career-best 29 points against the Cougars. He also reeled in a team-high eight rebounds in the victory. With eight minutes remaining in the first half, he slammed in an emphatic one-handed putback dunk off of a missed shot that circulated on highlight reels across the web. 
“That dunk was one of the best I’ve ever seen since I’ve been coaching,” coach Andy Enfield said. 
Metu was one of four double-figure scorers for USC in the game. Freshman guard Jonah Mathews contributed 18 points off the bench, while sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright and junior guard Elijah Stewart both scored 13 points. 
After taking a 38-33 lead at the half (11-12, 4-7), the Trojans finished the game strong offensively by shooting 17-of-23 (73.9 percent) from the field in the second half. 
Metu scored 17 of his game-high 29 points in the second half. Metu was 7-of-7 shooting from the field in the second half; overall, he finished the game 12-of-14 shooting. In that second half, USC also shot 6-of-10 from beyond the 3-point line. 
Washington State opened the second half on a strong run that pulled the Cougars within one point of USC with 10 minutes to play. USC countered the Washington State scoring run with a 22-11 burst that gave it a 14-point lead with just over 1:30 to play. 
Overall, USC converted 10 of its final 11 shots to conclude the game. 
Mathews shot 4-of-7 from behind the arc Saturday. In addition to his 18 points, he also reeled in six rebounds. 
“I just tried to bring the energy to the court today,” Mathews said. “My teammates did a great job of finding me tonight, and I was able to hit my shots.”
While both teams matched one another in rebounds at 33 apiece, Washington State received a huge effort on the glass from senior forward Josh Hawkinson, who recorded 17 points and 16 rebounds. 
In his second game since returning from an MCL injury, Boatwright shot 3-of-7 from 3-point range, recording 13 points to go along with 7 rebounds. A layup from Boatwright with three minutes remaining in the opening half gave the Trojans a 32-31 lead they would not surrender for the remainder of the contest. 
While he struggled shooting from the field (1-for-6), junior guard Jordan McLaughlin added four points and a team-high four assists to the Trojans’ winning efforts. With the wins over Washington (9-13, 2-8) and Washington State this weekend, USC completed its first conference road sweep since the 2011 season. 
“These are quality wins we’re getting,” Enfield said. “I’m very proud of those wins.”
Following the victory, the Trojans will return to the Galen Center on Thursday to take on visiting Oregon State (4-20, 0-11). The 20-4 record this season is the Trojans’ best start to a campaign since 1992. USC currently stands fifth in the Pac-12 standings with a conference record of 7-4. 
The winning road trip will make USC a prime contender for a ranking in the upcoming top 25 poll. The Trojans have been unranked since Jan. 19, when they suffered a 73-66 loss to then-No. 14 Arizona at home.

Wednesday was a monumental day for the USC football program. Any time the Trojans can finish in the top five of recruiting rankings, it is a successful National Signing Day, but this one had extra significance.
First and foremost, Clay Helton has proven that he is no step down from previous coaches on the recruiting front. In fact, not only can Helton and staff close on all the big names, but they also fill out position groups of need. Helton’s strategic approach to this recruiting class demonstrates a keen understanding of the type of team he needs to mold to be perennial playoff contenders.
For the second consecutive year, Helton finished with a flourish on signing day as the Trojans vaulted up the rankings. This signing day bonanza follows in the footsteps of former head coach Steve Sarkisian, who closed out his two recruiting classes with major coups. The first year of Sarkisian landed Adoree’ Jackson, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Damien Mama and Lamont Simmons on National Signing Day. The second year closed equally strong with the “Drive for Five,” when the Trojans secured the commitments of Porter Gustin, Rasheem Green, John Houston, Iman Marshall and the now-departed Osa Masina.
Many of these players have been the foundation of USC’s success the last few years, emphasizing the immense benefits of closing strong on National Signing Day. Hopefully, this year’s batch of last day signees like Austin Jackson, Joseph Lewis, Josh Falo, Levi Jones and Jay Tufele has the same immediate and long-term impact the last few classes have had.
In addition to the impressive haul Helton brought in on the final day, he also demonstrated a knack for strategically recruiting at positions of need while opening new pipelines in Los Angeles. This combination is what sets this year’s class apart from past groups.
Not since the Wild Bunch II with Omar Nazel, Kenechi Udeze, Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson has USC had a truly dominant defensive front four. This class may have set the foundation for a devastating defensive line down the road. With superb interior linemen like Tufele, Marlon Tuipulotu and Brandon Pili, the Trojans will have depth and the ability to substitute on the line for the first time in years. Additionally, USC was able to add to its formidable group of defensive ends with highly touted local prospect Hunter Echols.
It isn’t just the defensive line. Helton was able to bring in an influx of talent on the offensive side as well. Landing Jackson, offensive tackle Alijah Vera-Tucker and center Brett Neilon gives USC reinforcements on the offensive line after losing three starters from last year’s unit.
If college football has shown fans anything the last decade, it is that teams either win with dominant lines on both offense and defense or sensational quarterback play. In the immediate future, USC is fortunate to be led by the best quarterback in college football. This is great for the short term, but redshirt freshman Sam Darnold may only be playing on Saturdays for one more season. While he hopefully he graces Trojan fans with his presence for at least two more seasons, his ability to erase mistakes and win games through his otherworldly ability won’t last forever at USC.
Maybe freshman recruit Jack Sears or future Trojan quarterback Matt Corral can match Darnold’s impact, but if they cannot, it is comforting to know that Helton is building some of the best offensive and defensive line groups in the country.
Over the last few years, the only teams to beat Alabama were those with great quarterback performances (Oklahoma and Ole Miss) or the ability to match up with them across the board (Ohio State and Clemson) who also had a great quarterback performance. USC clearly didn’t have either last season in the embarrassing season opener. With Darnold at the helm, it may be a different story against the Tide if the Trojans can make it to the playoff next season. Long-term, though, USC is finally restocking its depth and talent at the positions that can compete with Alabama and Clemson in the trenches.
 It is not a coincidence that Pete Carroll’s best teams had an offensive and defensive line that all played in the NFL. That is why Helton’s ability to dominate the Southland and West Coast is so critical. For the most part, USC is unable to go into the South and beat out Alabama and LSU for the region’s top prospects.
 Fortunately, the Trojans have shifted their strategy to focus on the rich and fertile recruiting ground of Southern California and the rest of the West Coast. If USC can consistently get the types of lineman and skill players they brought in this year, almost exclusively from the West Coast, it will be able to match the best schools talent-wise. 
In years past, the Trojans have lost out on coveted targets to other Pac-12 schools. For the most part, Helton rectified this issue from past years and the Trojans are now reaping the rewards. National Signing Day was a milestone for USC in the present, and more importantly for the future. It is great to be a Trojan football fan yet again.

Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanWorking down low · Junior forward Kristen Simon drives the ball into the paint in a game against Hawaii. She scored 24 points against Cal.
After a tough loss to Stanford on Friday, the women’s basketball team looked to get their third consecutive win against Cal and to put the Stanford game behind them. It was a battle throughout the entire game, with neither team pulling farther than a few points ahead at a time, but ultimately it would be Cal that would come away with a 63-56 victory.
“I think we were competitive and we stayed in the game until the last two minutes,” senior guard Courtney Jaco said. “We just have to do a better job of executing in games, but I think we let that one slip away from us.”
Going into the game, the Bears’ Kristine Anigwe was leading her team with an average of 22.8 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. However, it would be USC’s junior forward Kristen Simon who outshined Anigwe both offensively and defensively. Not only did Simon finish the game without any fouls, a difficult feat for any post player, but she finished with 24 points and 9 rebounds, almost clinching yet another double-double this season. She also managed to hold Anigwe to only 10 points and 9 rebounds. 
While the Trojans finished the half down 28-25, it was Simon who kept them competitive throughout. But Cal remained solid across the board, effectively keeping the Trojans from taking the victory, while the Trojans struggled with spreading their scoring around. Four players from Cal finished the game with over 10 points, while only Simon was able to do so for the Trojans. 
The Cal bench delivered a strong 23 points, converted turnovers into more points, had more rebounds, more fast break points and converted at the line more than the Women of Troy. The game itself was still dominated by Simon, but it was the little things that all added up which earned Cal the win.
“Coach Cooper preaches a lot about taking care of the little things and making them important,” Jaco said. “At the end of the game, we didn’t do that. Those are the things we can control, and if we had done that we might have seen a different outcome.”
The Trojans will head up to north next weekend to take on Oregon State on Friday and Oregon on Sunday.
Whatever Coach Cooper preaches is not getting through to the players. Maybe her approach needs some new strategy.
Lose by 16 to Stanford scoring only 42 pts. is not a tough loss. Record in the conference speaks for itself. Time for a
change in leadership at the top. Coach has had her 4year term plus and the program is nearing the bottom.
AD Swann make your first move in the coaching ranks, and get the women the help they deserve to be competitive nationally.

Renowned for their culture-driven events around campus, the International Student Assembly and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly collaborated to present a fashion show displaying male and female traditional clothing at Ground Zero Performance Café last Friday. ISA’s vice president of public affairs, Angela Lin, helped spearhead the event.
“I wanted to create an event where students can present their cultures without boring the audience. I came up with the idea of a fashion show because fashion is a strong representation of a person’s identity,” Lin said. “It can be both cultural and personal, and it is something many people are interested in, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity for students to have fun while displaying their cultures.”
There were plenty of incentives for students to participate in the fashion showcase and for culturally curious viewers to show up to the event. The first 40 attendees were promised a free Ground Zero milkshake, and the winner of the fashion show would receive a $100 Nike gift card. There were a total of six contestants, representing various ethnic backgrounds including Chinese, Vietnamese and Korean heritage.
During the fashion show, contestants were judged based on aesthetics, individuality and the cultural twist to the outfit. The event was modeled after the tradition of beauty pageants, as each contestant was given a chance to model their outfit and then answer various questions from the host. These questions addressed the cultural inspiration for each contestant’s outfit, why they believed their attire stood out to the audience and the outfit’s overall significance. 
Under the dimly lit ambiance of Ground Zero, the contestants drew from their cultural background and described the impact their culture had on them, expressing sentiments widely shared among international students and Asian Americans.
Coco Lu, a sophomore majoring business, displayed her traditional Chinese qipao and explained how the garb symbolized not only her Chinese roots, but also her connection with family back in China. For Lily Hoang, a junior studying communication, her purple ao dai, a Vietnamese traditional garb, highlighted the culture she is extremely proud to represent. 
Next was freshman Yunji Lee, a South Korean student studying computer science. She sentimentally described how her hanbok signifies her childhood memories and serves as a symbol of her acceptance of her Korean heritage.
Out of the six contestants, Brian Dinh, a freshman majoring in fine arts, won the fashion competition, donning a bold long blue coat over white silk pants and a tucked-in shirt. Dinh has been designing his own outfits for many years. He exudes a bold and unique vibe within his fashion that encapsulates his personality.
Dinh described fashion as an outlet for his cultural philosophy.
“I’m creating a manifestation of the mentality of the Asian and American identity. My philosophy is to not live a day in the past, so I don’t like to repeat outfits,” Dinh said. “Every outfit is a bookmark for a day’s sentiments and memories and every outfit is individualized.”
As for the winning outfit, Dinh referred back to his Asian roots and how his heritage influenced his fashion choice.
“Since the theme was originally East Asian and traditional clothing, I wanted to stay true to that name and the event parameters, so I chose a look that really was a composite rather than just trying to show off an individual piece,” Dinh said.
For Lin, she hopes that individuals can walk away with a higher awareness for the diversity that exists at USC, even within Asian culture.
“There is a story behind every design, and for traditional cultural clothing, it is especially important to understand the concepts behind the fashion,” Lin said.

The annual Sundance Film Festival, an independent film event, took place in Park City, Utah from Jan. 19 to Jan. 29. The festival aims to showcase the unreleased works of independent and international filmmakers. These screenings are divided into separate sections for international, documentary, feature and short films. 
The Sundance Film Festival continues to capture audiences worldwide through diverse, thrilling features. Since its debut in 1978, the festival drew a record number of 46,600 attendees in 2016 and featured films such as Napoleon Dynamite, La La Land and American Psycho. 
Step
Directed by Amanda Lipitz
Step follows the high school senior Step team, which practices a dynamic form of synchronized dance that involves stomping from an all-girls charter school in inner-city Baltimore. Set amid the social unrest of the city, the film documents these girls’ lives from the stress of trying to succeed in Step competitions to getting into college.
What really makes this story powerful is its incredible stories of the girls. Many of these girls will be the first in their family to go to college but have to overcome economic and academic issues to get there. Both the dancers and their family members are animated characters that are entertaining to follow, but still feel genuine in their presentation. The moments of success really hit the audience, and tissues were brought out multiple times. Their dancing is part of the narrative and makes the film thrilling to watch.
However, the documentary sometimes becomes too stylish in its presentation of a very real story, and the cinematographer has issues focusing on all of the action, but besides that, Step is a deeply moving film that feels very important today. 
An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power 
Directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk
Eleven years ago, An Inconvenient Truth shook audiences to their core and made many realize the real threat of climate change. This threat has not gone away since 2006, making this documentary one of the few sequels that is desperately needed.
This film mostly focuses on Al Gore attempting to let facts be heard from real scientists, specifically in India, which is planning to build new coal-burning power plants. It also documents the changes that the planet has gone through since the first film.
It does make the viewer feel very scared about the future, especially the final sequence where Gore hears the election results, but it also ends with a sense of optimism as Gore feels hopeful and implores the audience to commit to this extremely important issue of climate change. 
Wind River
Directed by Taylor Sheridan
Taylor Sheridan has become one of the more prolific screenwriters over the last couple of years with his screenplays for Sicario and Hell or High Water, the latter recently earning him an Oscar nomination. Wind River is his directorial debut,  set in a desolate Indian reservation in Wyoming, where stoic hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) finds the body of a young woman miles away from civilization. Suddenly, he is brought into this murder case along with rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) without many resources in the heart of winter.
Like previous Sheridan projects, Wind River has a great sense of place; the lawlessness is truly felt and the rules of nature easily eclipse the rules of law with so little people around. The movie is quite tense, especially the final set piece, but also includes moments of natural humor that doesn’t distract from the narrative, yet rather adds much needed levity. This is easily Renner’s best performance since The Hurt Locker and his character’s fascinating backstory gives extra heartbreaking depth. Olsen is dramatic as a Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs-esque character as her moral sensibilities get crushed by the end in a final excellent moment.
Icarus 
Directed by Bryan Fogel
The third documentary of the festival for this writer, Icarus, to be brief, tells the story of Russian doping in sports. The filmmaker, Bryan Fogel, conceived the project to test the impact of performance enhancing drugs, but it turned into a different thing entirely when he met the former chief of Russia’s anti-doping lab and uncovered one of the biggest scandals in recent sports history. This story is one of the main reasons why some Russian athletes were not allowed to compete at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Therein lies the most interesting thing about Icarus: this much-publicized story told from an insider perspective. It is also quite frightening to see the power of President Vladimir Putin in his attempt to quiet his former director Grigory Rodchenkov. Unfortunately, the film spends too much time focusing on the initial pitch for the documentary, so by the time the really fascinating story comes around, the viewer is only intrigued for a part of it and then begins to reach for their watch. It is a documentary that would be much benefited from shortening its length by 20 or so minutes. But still, it is a captivating narrative that is well told.
My Life as a Zucchini
Directed by Claude Barras
Originally My Life as A Courgette (“Zucchini” in French), this animated film was originally made in French but dubbed with well-known American voices (Ellen Page, Nick Offerman, etc.) and was just recently nominated for the best animated feature Oscar, even though it has not screened in the United States. It is only 70 minutes long, but is devastating and incredible.
The film tells the story of a small boy named Zucchini, whose mom dies within the first few minutes of the film after which he is sent to a foster home/school with other kids who cannot live with their parents. The audience learns the reasons why these kids are there, and each one is more harrowing than the next. This film is overwhelming in its first 20 minutes with its heartache, but then takes a turn. It becomes sweet and uplifting, but always with a sense of melancholy. It also treats all of the characters with a respect that is rare for children’s movies in how well they flesh each one out. The “bully” in this foster home is not really a bully, rather just tough and insecure. 
The only real problem with this film is that it should just stay in its French language because items will come on screen in French, but the characters will be speaking in English and distract from this beautiful story. Also these well-known voices take the audience out of the story momentarily. But this does not take away too much from this poignant and incredibly touching film.

My dad and I are very similar — both in personality and physical traits. 
We both enjoy long car rides with rolled down windows, the Sunday morning Beatles’ radio tunes, authentic Mexican food and spontaneous travels. We even share the same almond eye shape and the quirky sense of humor that makes my mother cringe.
One of our few differences is that my dad is a staunch Republican. It was a fact stuffed into my little brain when I was about six years old, around the time of Ronald Reagan’s funeral. I recall being told admirable stories of these American presidents my dad lived under. They were heroes, he told me, as he praised Bush’s display of American strength. 
I was aware that my dad did not vote for former president Barack Obama when I watched that historical inauguration. Politics was just politics, I thought, an adult thing I didn’t have to deal or disagree with until I was a lot older. 
I dealt with it sooner than I expected — through a conflict of identity. 
My family was Catholic; I grew up with a subconscious stigma surrounding any sexuality that deviated from heterosexual norms and was raised to be critical of abortion and reproductive rights. 
Although I did not identify as bisexual until last year (which led to further qualms about the Church and social conservatism), I had been hanging onto a different “bi” label my entire life: bicultural. 
The Asian American struggle is one told time and time again, but it is difficult to identify with, unless you have experienced firsthand the inexplicable identity crisis caused by two contrasting cultural expectations. It is an intersectional struggle, as a female caught in between the lines of traditional Asian womanhood and America’s third-wave feminism. 
Although studies have shown that individuals are likely to identify with their family’s political perspectives, it is markedly different when my identity as a bisexual Asian American woman is neglected and unrecognized by my dad’s political alignment.
Politics becomes a separate personal narrative when it comes to differences within a family’s political alignment; it reveals the disparity in identity with the ones you are closest to. 
My dad is one of the thousands of boat people who fled the Communist Viet Cong regime in Vietnam during the foreign war that tore the fabric of American patriotism in the 1960s. He indebted himself to the Republican regime that interfered in his civil war, and despite their loss, my dad remains loyal to the anti-Communist, religious and fiscally conservative cause to this day. 
We are the model of a traditional, church-going nuclear family: My mother stays at home, my father is the breadwinner,and I am the hardworking college student — albeit my socially liberal stances and bicultural crisis create a stark contrast to the values my parents hold dear.
I know I won’t ever come out to my parents about my political or lifestyle differences because I know that they can’t understand. They don’t understand my agnostic religious views, my bisexuality or my choice to not “settle down” until my mid-30s. 
My identity as a first-generation Asian American lies in a completely different realm from theirs, and though we share overlapping struggles with assimilation and cultural expectations, my liberal outlook is a product of an environment my parents have never experienced. 
I grew up in an inclusive society that embraced the outliers of social norms. I was taught tolerance and I began to recognize prevalent social issues at the same age my dad was forced to escape from a dictatorial government.
This is the point where our childhood experiences diverged — how our complicated identity separates itself from the modern identity politics.

Beyoncé is pregnant, and the world has erupted. The artist’s announcement on Instagram broke the record for most-liked post, while 500,000 tweets were sent out regarding this news within 45 minutes. The public’s reaction is indeed indicative of the loyal fanbase — with its constant, bursting admiration — that the popstar has built since her rise to fame in the late 1990s. While the Beyhive buzzes, I’m left confounded once again.
Although I’m not a fan of Beyoncé’s music, simply out of musical preference, I have tried to gain an appreciation for the artist in recent years as she’s taken on weightier themes, such as black empowerment and feminism. Her latest visual album Lemonade addresses police brutality, black identity and marital woes in a package that neither speaks softly nor rests on visual tropes. Lemonade has all the makings of a potentially transformative and refreshingly subversive piece of art. But its impact — like Beyoncé’s activism in general — is limited. 
Her work suffers from the malignant capitalist pursuit to which it is bound. Underneath the choreography, one discovers a predictable consumerist formula dressed up as radical empowerment. Make no mistake, Bey wants your money. In the song “Formation” from Lemonade, she intersperses consumerist, self-aggrandizing lyrics about “paper” being the “best revenge” and becoming “a black Bill Gates,” with lyrics that celebrate blackness. Beyoncé’s claim that freedom lies in maximizing wealth ultimately erodes a concurrent, positive narrative of black empowerment.
Beyoncé’s activism is, first and foremost, an act of branding intended to raise her public image and personal wealth. Take a look at her sparsely populated Twitter feed and you’ll find a post from 2013 promoting World Humanitarian Day. She wrote, “Today is World Humanitarian Day. Another day to #Beygood #TheWorldNeedsMore.” The hashtag #Beygood is one example of how the singer subtly uses activism as a means of self-promotion. Until Beyoncé removes herself from the system that has thrived on the subjugation of black bodies, her advocacy, whether on Twitter or in her music, will continue to resound with a hollow beat.
Moreover, activism — from celebrities or students — effectively loses all meaning when performed out of self-interest. The presidential election and the consequent surge of student activism have forced me to reflect on both my personal motivations and the motivations of my peers. Are we compelled to march and chant because we want to be a part of a trend, or are we seriously invested in fighting for actual change? Are we more concerned about our resumes and reputations than making real sacrifices for a cause outside ourselves? 
I can only imagine what change might emerge if the kind of zeal for Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement were directed toward something desperately in need of our attention. 
We live in a time during which we are bombarded with information and must make decisions as to how we consume that information and what we do with that knowledge. Turning knowledge into action is a task certainly encumbered by the seduction of news intended to grab our wallets rather than to motivate anything consequential. 
If we accept celebrities as activists, we must be prepared to be critical. Liking an artist’s music is not justification for praising their every move and offering our unqualified support. Idolization breeds blindness. Now, more than ever, we need to keep our eyes open and be willing to challenge the systems that have brought us to the present — a world filled with unmitigated human suffering, ravaged by the neoliberal agendas we have left unchecked. 
With hope, I look forward to the day when human suffering garners more attention than a celebrity’s Instagram. In the meantime, don’t sting me, hive.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Setting foot on the UC Berkeley campus last Wednesday, far-right personality Milo Yiannopoulos was greeted with a deluge of anger and protests, both peaceful and violent. Yiannopoulos, an editor for Breitbart News, had been booked to speak by the Berkeley College Republicans but was rushed from campus after fires were lit and glass shattered over his presence. Having risen to recent notoriety over his Twitter attacks against Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones, Yiannopoulos is reviled for his outlandish racism and misogyny. In the wake of Yiannopoulos’ failed attempt to speak at UC Berkeley, President Donald Trump tweeted out a condemnation of actions he blamed on the school administration for preventing Yiannopoulos from exercising his freedom of speech. 
And yet, there is a distinct difference between censoring Yiannopoulos and stating emphatically, with peaceful protest, that the students of UC Berkeley do not condone giving a platform to a man who edits Breitbart News, who writes articles titled “Here’s Why There Ought to be a Cap on Women Studying Science and Maths,” who launched racist and sexist attacks on Jones and desperately utilizes pomp and provocation to create outrage and attract attention. There is a difference between not wanting a man like that on campus and silencing that man, because silencing is an extreme stance to take on what happened. Yiannopoulos will go home and still be an editor for Breitbart. He will still retain a massive following, even without his Twitter account or a speech at UC Berkeley.
It needs to be recognized that the university gave its full support to the group that booked Yiannopoulos. And so it was not the administration that barred Yiannopoulos from speaking, not even many of the peaceful student activists. It was a violent group of individuals who lit fires and sprayed anarchy symbols on school buildings, and that degree of action is intolerable even against intolerable people. But that didn’t stop Trump from rushing to Twitter. “If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” he tweeted at 3:12 a.m. 
The disaccord in his statement was evident. For a president to not understand this, or worse, to know it and still not care, is horrifying. Read between the lines of what Trump is playfully threatening, and one will see the double-edged sword. UC Berkeley has long been a bedrock of liberal college activism, and moreover, as a university, promotes research and progress in the fields of science and math. Universities are hotbeds for intellectual and political discourse, and for the president to cut off federal support — is that not silencing in its own nature, of a more devastating sort?
It is difficult to pin this on Yiannopoulos, because he gives off the impression of someone who thrives on outrage and disaccord. But as for Trump and his administration, what they are asking for is not peaceful protest — they want no protest at all. They want to be able to say what they want to applause and ovation, and that is not how the country works. If conservatives are willing to point at political correctness as an impediment to freedom of speech and willing to hold freedom of speech above the livelihoods of marginalized citizens and immigrants, then they also need to recognize the other side of the equation. Say what you want, but understand that others will disagree, especially if your words dehumanize them and the people they love. That is how democracy works.
Perhaps if conservatives were as concerned with freedom of speech as they claim to be, they should protect the press from what is surely a presidential war being waged on the media. If free speech were as paramount and American as conservatives obsess over, then they must focus on the disregard for truth by the government’s executive branch. Focus on the fact that the president labeled the media “the opposition party” and that the press secretary spouts easily-detected lies from the White House podium.
It is a disturbing and transparent tactic of the oppressor to take the accusations lobbed at them and turn them against the oppressed and those who fight for truth. It’s the same mentality Trump uses when he calls CNN “fake news” before taking a question from Breitbart, when he reprimands Berkeley for withholding Yiannopoulos’ freedom of speech but holds conferences with prominent journalists accusing them of sullying his image. The truth is not contingent to the First Amendment, and yet the men in charge of the country are currently using that very American value selectively to spread lies and create fear. They are dirtying the Constitution in the name of democracy, and to do all this while pretending to protect the voice of a known bigot is absurd.
OK. Some good points in this article. But I am confused where the article led and the conclusions.
1. Yiannopoulos has unpopular, bigoted ideas and given the chance, presumably would have preached his philosophy at UC Berkely. OK, I get it. So is this good enough to justify student thugs shattering windows and setting fires while denying a speaker the right to speak? And denying the sponsoring student group from hearing him?
2. “. . . Universities are hotbeds for intellectual and political discourse. . . .”  I get that, too. So how does this correlate with UC Berkeley students shutting down whatever intellectual and political discourse might spring from debating Yiannopoulos’ ideas – ok, even bad ideas. Which ideas shall be permitted to emerge? Only those of the majority of students? Not opposing ideas, even if they are unacceptable to most students?
3. “The truth is not contingent to the First Amendment. . . .” This sentence aims to condemn the Trump administration because it “spreads lies and creates fear.”  Does the sentence also mean that speakers at a university should be prohibited from speaking and violence created because some students think that way of the speaker?
My conclusion is different. I can agree with assertions about the Trump administration that Zoe Cheng made in her article. But it seems to be that the real point should be that students should riot, smash windows, throw firebombs and shut down speakers because he will likely present ideas they find repellent.  This is not the discourse one should find in a university.
I hope that this ugly, narrow-minded book-burning mentality of behavior never shows up at USC. If I were to hear such a speaker at USC call for a dictatorship in the US, a communist economic system and similar ideas, I might listen with curiosity. Who brought this speaker here? And why? Why did USC authorize this speaker? More likely, I would walk away with disgust. I am certain, though, that I would not clothe myself in a black costume, smash windows, set fires and drive off the speaker.
Thank you for your comment. I am really confused about why every single negative article about Milo brings up Trump. Although Milo was for Trump he is not Trump and shouldn’t be solely associated with him. 
I also understand that bigoted views are unpopular but my concern is that 1.) a view being unpopular = not allowed to speak, and 2.) who gets to define bigotry? People keep using these really intense labels and it isn’t always applied correctly.
They should have just let him speak. His book is #1 on preorder and I’m sure it wasn’t just conservatives who purchased it after this riot…. 
Universities are known for their highly liberal environment in politics and other thinking. Fine. But what is liberal about rioting and driving off a speaker? If his views are repulsive, then when questions are asked, stand up and comment, ask questions that make clear the nastiness of the speaker’s message. True liberalism permits and encourages free speech. If the speech is purely pointed insults to the audience, or calls for violence, then perhaps closing it down could be justified. But this speaker at UC Berkeley, however vile, was invited by an authorized student group, had an idea to discuss and should have been treated with dignity and silence. Those Cal students acted in a shameful manner and God forbid that USC students ever do the same.
Perfect, Don.

It was a long time ago that I flew in that old trainer, the T-1A Lockheed Sea Star. Still, it was a nice photo of me and reminds me of some easy-going and pleasant times. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e57bf6d4c6292932ebd2b6062a36f4e61bdf0806a78a047f4df1d4f057f98135.jpg
Perhaps one can understand if some students booed the speaker, although I despise that. But smash and burn is another matter.
The hate speeches and property destruction are all coordinated efforts by the Left and anarchists to create fear and mayhem on college campuses and cities around the country.  Their purpose is based on fear mongering and false information.   The Left’s propaganda machine is working very well.  College students today’s are so easily ,anipulated, emotiinally, because they have been indoctrinated by the Left through liberal teachers and professors since they were in grade school.  Yes, thus indoctrination has been going on for 50 years and this is a key reason why there is so much back lask being thrown at anyone who has a contrary opinion or position.  Liberals are all m in for freedom of expression, free speech rights… except when yours is contrary to theirs.  And that’s the unAmerican values they are pushing on college campuses today.
You nailed it, KatMan: “Liberals are all m in for freedom of expression, free speech rights. . . except. . . .”  That UC student behavior was not liberal at all.

As the newest member of the vegan community, I have really tried to suppress my fantasies about cheese. But sometimes you just cannot escape them. With my cheese craving building up for weeks, I had to get my hands on some vegan mac n’ cheese. Lucky for me, I stumbled upon Sage Plant Based Bistro.
Located near Echo Park in Silver Lake, Sage boasts an entirely plant-based menu filled with comfort food classics, only not as bad for you. Sage simply does vegan food right. Often times, vegan food can be too complex and try too hard to overcompensate for the lack of animal product. Sage, however, uses the natural flavors and taste of plant-based foods in a way that doesn’t make you miss the animal products. It does not try to replicate animal-product foods but actually makes you fall in love with plant-based foods.
The restaurant itself has an earthy, hipster vibe, filled with natural wood tables and muted tones. With ground seating and lofted seating, the restaurant maintains an intimate atmosphere, while still managing to seat a fairly large crowd. The menu is extensive, ranging from vegan jackfruit tacos, to creamy pasta dishes, to curries and to orange chicken. All of the options satisfying the craving for unhealthy comfort foods without sacrificing the taste.
With my cheese cravings in full force, I had to order the spicy avocado mac n’ cheese. As a self-proclaimed former cheese connoisseur, I stood firmly in my beliefs that cheese could simply not be recreated sans-dairy. Sage’s vegan mac n’ cheese made me swallow my words. It was just as creamy, flavorful and decadent as traditional mac n’ cheese. The cheesy pasta was served over a blanket of sautéed kale and broccoli, helping me get a good serving of greens. The mac n’ cheese had just the right amount of spice to give it a little bit of a bite, but not overpower the cheesy flavor. With the extensive dessert menu, I simply couldn’t skip a sweet. I ordered a scoop of the “vacation” vegan ice cream, which had a banana base with chocolate swirls, cacao nibs and coconut shavings. Once again, Sage provided all of the creaminess of ice cream, just without the actual cream. I left Sage beyond satisfied and stuffed,but definitely not feeling sick, which would usually happen if I consumed a meal entirely full of cheesy and creamy goodness. If you’re looking for a new place to take your picky vegan friends or are a new vegan, give Sage Plant Based Bistro a try. You will not regret it!

Los Angeles is perhaps one of the best cities to experience the quintessential endless summer in Southern California. With miles of picturesque coastline from Malibu to the South Bay, it has some of the best oceanfront getaways for beach bums. Beaches in Los Angeles are for those who enjoy sun-bathing, surfing, swimming, water skiing, beach volleyball, drinking beer with your toes in the sand or anything else by the water. Each one has its own unique character and charm.

Santa Monica State Beach for a Summer Carnival feel:
This huge beach, which effectively runs the length of Santa Monica itself, is usually packed and has a festive, summer holiday feel to it. With the iconic Santa Monica Pier that is considered the focal point of the beach and the mountains in the backdrop, the view is quite stunning. Musicians and performers on the Pier, food stands, Pacific Park with the traditional setup of Ferris wheel and other fairground games add a carnival charm to the place. The beach itself is a long walk from the Promenade and is usually bustling with people engaged in beach volleyball or just merry sun soaking, which makes it the place to be!

Venice Beach for people-watching:
This is one beach  where it’s almost as much about the people as it is about the surf or the sand. 
There’s a lot to do — the winding Venice Boardwalk lined with Palm trees, where you can skate or cycle, watch or play volleyball or basketball, check out the pumped-up gym bunnies who work out at Muscle Beach or the skating pros showcasing a trick or two at the skating rink adjacent to the boardwalk. And not to miss, the Venice Canal walkway not too far from the beach makes a perfect place for a leisurely stroll on a nice evening. I was in awe of it so much that I wrote an entire column on it last semester! 
Shruthi Hiriyuru | Daily Trojan
Manhattan Beach for the classic stretch of sand:
Manhattan Beach is known to be a hotspot for beach volleyball and surfing. Unfortunately the two times I’ve been there was after nightfall. First time, we hung out on the beach, watching the moonlight dance on the waves while the waters lapped gently against the pillars supporting the Pier. The second time around we landed up there during pre-Christmas week to witness the Manhattan Beach’s signature annual holiday event: Manhattan Beach Fireworks. I think perhaps the entire town had turned up to kick-off the holiday season. Lying on the cool beach sand, wrapped in blankets, we gazed into the night sky as it exploded in a multitude of colors and squealed in delight as the lit up sky looked as if it were showering a thousand falling stars on us. 
I found that the beach in general, not being as horrifically over-commercialized as the Santa Monica Pier or as no-frills as the one in Venice, offers a more refined scenery and makes for a perfect leisurely hangout.

El Matador State beach for the hopeless romantic:
Tucked away in a secluded pocket along the Pacific Coast Highway, this stunning beach is a utopia for photographers and nature lovers. With its ridged cliffs, rocky outcrops and hidden coves, it makes a perfect destination for dream photoshoots. The drive to the beach in itself is quite enjoyable as the crisp ocean breeze welcomes you as you hit the PCH. The beach is accessible via a steep gravelly path. And true to its fame, you’ll find at least a handful of photographers with their tripods trying to get that perfect shot of the wave crashing along the rocks or of couples posing for their wedding photos against the idyllic backdrop of the ocean waves with the sunlight peeking in through the arch made by the coves. We reached there during sunset and were rewarded with one of the most spectacular sunsets we’d ever witnessed. If you’re with someone, you’d want to walk the length of the beautiful shore hand-in-hand and wish you could fade away into the sunset. If you’re single, well, you could watch the couples do it and melt away into your own dreams!
The L.A. coastline is dotted with many other such pristine beaches. No matter whether you’re a beach volleyball person, a water skier, a surfer or a just beach bum who loves an evening with a beer in hand and sand between the toes, there’s one out there, waiting for you!

My journalism and communications class recently assigned a project where I was not allowed to use technology for 24 hours. That’s right, a full day without my phone, laptop, TV or anything with an “on” switch. At first I thought it was impossible to live without technology for a day. In the end I was kind of right but learned some valuable lessons along the way:
 
We use technology throughout the day without even knowing it.
 
I started my “technology blackout” day having brunch at my sorority house. This is where I faced my first challenge: In order to get into the house, you need to use a digital fingerprint scanner. Since I was not allowed to have any contact with electronics, I resorted to an old-fashioned knock on the door to get into the house. When I returned to my dorm, I needed to use a digital fingerprint again in order to pass security. This made me realize not only is our campus’ security tech-savvy, but we also rely heavily on technology to get through our days. Even something as simple as getting into a building uses technology. 
 Our phones do not have to be our lifelines.
Whether it is texting, sending emails, checking social media or listening to music, I rely on my phone for communication and entertainment. However, having my phone off for the day was a relief. I didn’t have that mini panic attack you get when you think you’ve lost your phone (when in fact it’s buried at the bottom of your bag), and I didn’t obsess over my social media notifications throughout the day. More importantly, I realized the device I depend on for communication was actually preventing me from communicating with others. As I walked around campus that day, I noticed almost everyone was walking with their heads down, staring at their phone screens. Since I didn’t have the privilege of walking with my phone glued to my hand, I started noticing my surroundings more. I realized I passed by numerous friends and familiar faces around campus but am typically “too busy” looking at my phone to notice the people around me. This activity taught me technology can provide a distraction from experiencing everyday encounters. 
 Technology exists for our own convenience.
While it may be convenient to fingerprint scan your way into a building or use social 
media as a distraction when walking around campus, this 24-hour cleanse reminded me the world does not have to revolve around technology. I was able to appreciate face-to-face conversations over my Facebook feed and embrace everyday moments rather than worry about Snapchatting them. This is not to say we should get rid of technology altogether. Living in a technologically driven society, it is quite difficult to go through our everyday lives without access to electronics. However, it is important to think twice about how much technology we use in a day and re-evaluate when technology is a necessity versus a convenience. 
Ultimately, I highly recommend reconnecting with your technology-free self. If you commit to spending a day without electronics, you’ll be surprised how this eye opening experience will put a twist on your typical day.

For most of us, morning people are like being professional athletes. We wish we were disciplined/motivated/energetic/alive enough to be one, but we just aren’t, end of story. 
“I’m not a morning person” — commonly said by you, me, him, her, your next door neighbor, my dog, your cat, everyone, ever.
That said, without being cheesy and you-can-do-anything-and-be-anyone-you-want-to-be, you honestly can be a morning person, if you decide to. Although before I tell you how, however, let’s start with why — why should you be a morning person? What’s the point?
Reasons to be a morning person (especially in college):




Now that you’re convinced and you want to be a morning person (admit it, you do), let’s move onto the how. Try implementing a few/all of these steps, and really stick with it for a solid two weeks (it takes time to change your habits; be patient). Your life will change for the better.

If you live in Los Angeles and like ice cream, you’ve probably heard of Salt & Straw. The name has become more relevant as a new flagship store popped up in the Arts District just last fall. Instead of venturing to Venice or Studio City, USC students can now get this delicious treat Downtown. 
Salt & Straw originated in Portland and has expanded to Los Angeles and San Francisco. They make small batch ice cream made from local farm-sourced ingredients. Salt & Straw is not like any other ice cream. People frequent this artisanal ice cream shop for its unconventional, inventive flavors like Pear and Blue Cheese. The first time I went to Salt & Straw, I was overwhelmed by the long list of flavor choice. So, below is a list of four delicious choices for those who need some guidance.

Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons
The salt, Fleur de Sel, in this ice cream is top of the line. The salt was created with the help of Mark Bitterman, who owns a salt shop in Portland and even wrote a book called Salted. The combination of salt with hand-burned caramel made in house is what makes this flavor one of Salt & Straw’s most popular.

Almond Brittle with Salted Chocolate Ganache
The shop makes their almond brittle in house. Then chunks of salted ganache are added into the the into creamy vanilla ice cream. This flavor is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Both of the flavors are intense but complement each other extremely well.

Lavender Honey
Some people may have reservations about an ice cream flavor that also sounds like a dish soap. Don’t be afraid because this is one of Salt & Straw’s tastiest flavors. The shop steeps the lavender petals in honey to extract the perfect floral flavor. The ice cream is a light purple color and tastes sweet, creamy and unique.

Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper
Black pepper and balsamic in ice cream? Salt & Straw finds a way to make this taste absolutely incredible. This flavor uses fresh strawberries, high quality balsamic and black pepper from Pohnpei, one of the finest pepper producers of the world. The result is a delicious flavor.
