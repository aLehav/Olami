The 2026 class of 3,420 students broke numerous admissions-related records after going through USC’s second most selective admission cycle ever with an acceptance rate of 12% — just above the 2019 acceptance rate of 11.5%. The class of 2026 has the highest entering average GPA in USC history: 3.87 on an unweighted 4.0 scale, an increase from the 3.83 entering average GPA of last year’s class.
USC Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said the class of 2026 has shown great progress in terms of “diversity and talent.” A third of students in the class of 2026 come from historically underrepresented groups. Twenty-two percent of students are the first in their family to go to college, an upward trend in USC admissions: only 12% of students in the class of 2012 were first-generation. 
Debra Erdenemandakh, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and economics sees herself as a “minority within a minority” because of her Asian and Mongolian background. Before starting at USC, she worried about fitting in on campus but said she was pleasantly surprised about the level of diversity in the class of 2026. 
“When we think of USC, we think of very prestigious, all-white, higher-income individuals, but I’ve met a surprisingly good amount of Black and Indigenous people and people of color who come from lower-income backgrounds,” Erdenemandakh said. “Although it is a minority, since we go to a predominantly white institution, those people still have a voice…and an identity on campus.”
This year’s freshman class is also geographically diverse. ​Students come from 49 states — only North Dakota is not represented — the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories and 72 countries outside the U.S. California, home to 41.3% of students, is the most represented state, followed by New York, Washington, Texas and Illinois. Eighteen percent of freshmen are international students, a 5% increase from the previous year’s freshman class.
“There was a bit of a downturn [in the number of international students] during the Trump administration … because of the way that other countries saw U.S. policies and whether or not this country was friendly to international students,” Brunold said. “Then there was the pandemic and so people weren’t able to travel. There were a lot of things in the three to five-year backwards horizon that was depressing the numbers.”
The Spring Admission Program will welcome 489 freshmen students next semester as of now. The program functions as both a waitlist and an enrollment management tool to keep enrollment steady from term to term. Brunold said the University has extra capacity in the spring because many students graduate mid-year or study abroad. 
“[The program has] really served the needs of the University,” Brunold said. “It isn’t for everyone, and we also understand that a lot of students who are admitted to the spring term are disappointed about that. But the fact is that we continue to work quite diligently to make sure that these students’ transition and experience at USC remains good.”
Initially, Katherine Lee, a freshman majoring in film and television production, felt discouraged when she was accepted to the University as a spring admit.
“I was super confused,” Lee said. “I feel like a lot of us don’t really know what’s wrong with us … I don’t think that helped with our confidence because a lot of kids got in in the fall and that makes us think we’re like extras in the way.” 
Joining the spring mentor group helped change Lee’s mindset on entering USC in the second semester. She looks forward to the social events with other spring admits, as well as working with her two mentors.
“Doing my own research has definitely helped me a lot to realize that I’m not any lesser,” Lee said. “People [in the group] share their experience with you, like what they’ve gone through as a spring admit … It definitely decreased my imposter syndrome.”
The USC Office of Admissions dealt with its third cycle of test-optional admissions for the class of 2026. The Office will decide whether to keep the university’s current test-optional policy very soon, Brunold said.
“We’re still studying what the impacts have been,” Brunold said “We’ve been able to select fantastically prepared students and students who fit very well into the University even in the absence of test scores … I would be surprised if we didn’t continue to be test-optional at least for a few more years as we continue to study this.”
Half of the entering students in the class of 2026 submitted test scores. Erdenemandakh said she supports USC’s current test-optional policy because it allows students to showcase their talents without feeling the pressure to let a number define them. 
“Standardized testing sometimes hurts applicants, especially if you couldn’t take standardized tests because you didn’t have the money or the resources,” Erdenemandakh said. “It [disproportionately affects] certain people in certain groups rather than helping uplift an application.”

New members of USC’s Film and Television Writers club spend their first semester learning how to write for film — attending workshops about how to write for screen production, format scripts, conduct interviews and network. Panelists with experience in film also come in to share their knowledge. 
However, the focus of the club is not exclusively screenwriting. Max Jenkins, a junior majoring in narrative studies and cognitive science, serves as one of the club’s presidents and has been involved since his first semester at USC. 
“We teach all different aspects of filmmaking, from idea to creation,” he said. 
After learning the basics and working collaboratively on scripts for short films, people have the option to submit these scripts for consideration to be made into feature films. Everyone in the club is welcome to submit a script, and submissions from this semester are currently in the process of being reviewed and selected. Ultimately, two scripts are chosen, and the club spends the second semester getting hands-on experience with production by adapting these scripts into films. 
The club started with the purpose of making resources from the School of Cinematic Arts available to everyone, said Charlotte Doyle, a junior majoring in business administration and co-president of FTW. She joined the club last fall and has been involved for about a year. Doyle said FTW offers the opportunity to learn about the industry and use resources that may otherwise be limited without committing to studying film. 
“The reason FTW started a couple years ago was because SCA makes it difficult to use any of the great USC connections and resources without actually being an SCA major,” she said. 
People from all backgrounds are encouraged to join, and there are no requirements or minimum commitments. Both presidents said that many people who are involved are not in the SCA, representing a wide range of interests. 
“When you join as a general member there’s no obligation,” Doyle said. “The biggest point of our club is to include all majors, not just SCA film majors but people of all majors and people of all experience levels. Our goal here is really to make the film industry a lot more accessible.”
Matias Leviano, a freshman majoring in theater, joined the club this year because of his passion and curiosity about film. He said he signed up to explore if he wants to add an additional major or a minor in cinematic arts, referring to the club as an “opportunity” to do so without joining SCA. 
Leviano said the guest speakers are the best part of the club. One meeting was especially noteworthy to him because it was a cinematography workshop, and the speaker brought in professional materials such as lights and cameras for student use. 
“We had like two workshops to work on our scripts and had to submit them,” he said. “It was a lot, but it’s fun.” 
For those looking to join, the club has a few different divisions that serve different purposes. Many people are general members, which anyone can join as. There is also an executive board with two presidents, which works on running the club smoothly, and a development team, which works to  keep the club going and assists with scripts during the second-semester productions. 
“My favorite part of the club is the communities that we’ve built,” Doyle said. 
FTW holds meetings once a week and is open to new members throughout the semester. People that want to get involved are welcome to reach out with questions or scripts of their own. To get in contact with FTW’s leadership, interested students can reach out via email at  filmandtvwritersusc@gmail.com or on Instagram @ftwusc.

The influenza outbreak has arrived on campus. Eleven percent of visits to Student Health last week were related to influenza-like illnesses, and 20% of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza — surpassing the outbreak threshold, according to Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman.
“Flu is very, very early this year,” said Van Orman in a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan. “We’re seeing it on campus. We’re seeing it throughout [Los Angeles] County. We’re seeing it nationally.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Nov. 4 that 4.3% of healthcare provider visits nationally last week were for respiratory illness and 9.0% of clinical lab tests tested positive for influenza. California’s Department of Public Health reported 3.7% and 7.9% respectively for the week prior. The early arrival of the outbreak is part of an ongoing pattern of abnormalities with the “normal seasonality” of influenza in the last couple of years, Van Orman said. She also said cases were present last March and April — nationwide and at USC — a “very unusual” time for influenza to be present.
“We don’t understand all the reasons why it’s different,” Van Orman said. “It probably has to do with the fact that masking was on and off, … and we just didn’t see it for two years … What we don’t know is whether we’re going to get a small, early spike and then we’re [not] going to see a lot of cases, or if this is the beginning of a prolonged and severe flu season.”
Van Orman said influenza can cause serious illness — possibly exacerbated by absence of the virus the last few years due to “pandemic-related mitigation measures” — and may negatively impact students’ academic studies.
“We routinely see people with fevers of 102, 103 [degrees Fahrenheit], cough, body aches, not able to get out of bed for a couple of days, not able to go to class, not able to focus or study,” she said. “Those symptoms can linger for five, six, seven days.”
Coronavirus cases are already on the rise ahead of Thanksgiving, though Van Orman stopped short of calling it a surge; Student Health reported 144 positive tests the week beginning Oct. 30, a 27% increase from 113 cases the week prior. Van Orman said University housing facilities are also reporting positive wastewater detections. Nonetheless, recommendations from the University on coronavirus response will remain the same, Van Orman said. Student Health does not currently expect to put vaccination or testing requirements in place, and will continue encouraging individuals to test before and after traveling elsewhere and avoid travel when sick.
Pfizer and BioNTech released updated data Friday “demonstrating a robust neutralizing immune response” for recipients of the bivalent vaccine compared to unvaccinated individuals. At the time of publication, the data has not been peer-reviewed, but for now confirms expectations of efficacy following approvals from the CDC and Food and Drug Administration. Whether a cycle of frequently updated boosters for new variants is sustainable in the long-term remains to be seen; Van Orman said it may undermine confidence in vaccines despite their proven efficacy.
“Lack of knowledge and certainty in the evolution [of a novel virus] is to be expected,” Van Orman said. “That doesn’t mean the vaccines aren’t efficacious, but I think it’s really a challenge of communication to help people to understand: We can be confident in the value, the safety and the efficacy of the vaccines as they are, and still not be able to say with certain[ty] that we understand the virus and how the virus is going to evolve.”
Van Orman said that there has been “remarkable progress” since the emergence of the coronavirus, with hospitals no longer overwhelmed and working vaccines and antivirals against the virus now widely available.
“But it is going to be a more prolonged process to get to a point of stability — with exactly knowing how we’re going to manage this virus in the way that we do other respiratory viruses such as influenza,” Van Orman said. “We still struggle to get everybody vaccinated  and depending on the year 30,000 to 50,000 people die every year of influenza in the United States. Many of those deaths are vaccine preventable because they’re in people who did not get an influenza vaccine. So just continuing to stress the importance of vaccination and the fact that vaccines save lives.”

Editor’s note: At the time of publication, some determinative House and Senate election results were too close to call.  
As the midterm election results roll in, USC students cited a number of issues on their mind while they visited the polls on Nov. 8, with abortion and public safety having the most influence on their votes. 
Both issues are of significant importance to college students across the country. A 2022 survey of 1077 college students from around the country conducted by NBC News and Generation Lab found that 30% of rising sophomores stated they would transfer schools if they lost access to abortions. The National Center for Education Statistics found that 43% of on-campus crimes reported in 2019 were sexual assault cases, establishing sexual crime prevention and support as a key issue affecting college students.
All 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 35 of the seats in the Senate were at stake in the midterm election. Due to the slim majority that the Democratic party had in both branches — 9 seats in the House of Representatives and the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Harris in the Senate — either party could have easily gained control of both branches. 
With majorities in both assemblies being determined by the election, the votes of USC students were influenced by a few key issues. Shaleen Sunesara, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, says she voted based on “abortion rights as well as gun control, and I think just human rights.” 
The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in the recent Dobbs v. Jackson case left the issue of abortion up to individual states, mobilizing drastic increases in female voter registration in swing states like Pennsylvania, according to Rutgers. 
Leah Nwizugbo, a freshman majoring in political science, agreed that abortion was a prominent subject in her voting experience. 
“The fact that abortion was on the ticket is actually one of the things that really did influence me to get out to the polls and vote,” Nwizugbo said. “It’s really important that states produce effective legislation that can address abortion.”
While many Democrats have been attempting to mandate abortion into federal law, the party has consistently been blocked by legislative delays such as the use of the filibuster. If Democrats are unable to keep control of the House and gain at least 10 seats in the Senate, it is likely abortion access will continue to be denied in many states, or result in further restrictions in swing states. 
USC students have been moved by these close election issues, such as Charlotte Anderson, a sophomore majoring in public relations. Her vote to reelect Colorado Gov. Jared Polis was primarily influenced by abortion rights. 
“He is definitely in support of abortion rights,” Anderson said. “And that was a huge thing for me. So I definitely want to make sure he stays in office.” 
While the issue of codifying abortion rights is a centerpiece of Democratic campaigns, crime is not. While the murder rate is lower than it was in the 1990s, the FBI reported a 30% increase in the national homicide rate from 2019 to 2020, which was the largest single-year increase ever recorded in the U.S. GOP candidates, like Lee Zeldin, who’s running for governor in New York, have cracked down on crime in their campaigns, cementing it as a key issue for their elections. 
However, public safety for students has become intertwined with gun control. Bryan Fernandez, a freshman majoring in political science, was particularly mindful of the issue after a school in his hometown experienced a shooting threat. 
“I think that definitely influences young voters, especially knowing that we either have siblings or friends back at home, in high schools where they have to fear for their own lives day to day basis,” Fernandez said.
Sunesara agrees with the sentiment, saying that gun control is a constant, countrywide issue. 
“I think by voting for a certain party, you’re able to maybe counter the effects of the high use of guns and maybe regulate gun usage,” she said.
USC students and college students across the country will keep these issues in mind as the results of yesterday’s races continue to be confirmed.

On Sept. 13, Mahsa Amini was detained by Iran’s “morality police” who insisted that she was in violation of their compulsory hijab law — a law that requires females who are nine years and older to adequately cover their hair and dress in a covered, modest fashion.
She was pronounced dead in the hospital three days after Iranian authorities alleged that her subsequent coma was caused by a “heart attack.” However, experts from the United Nations reported detailed evidence of her torture and mistreatment by authorities.
Beginning in the aftermath of Iran’s Islamic revolution in 1983, women — regardless of citizenship or religion — were mandated to wear a hijab while in public. Though this law is loosely constructed, specifics in regards to enforcing this rule are up to the discretion of the “morality police.”
As soon as the news broke of the suspicious circumstances of Amini’s death, protests began in multiple cities in Iran, such as Tehran, Ilam and Tabriz — all of which demanded the truth as well as an end to the violence endured by Iranian women at the hands of the government. 
After decades of repression, many women have pushed back in an extremely brave, yet costly manner. Young women — as young as school girls — have been at the heart of organizing protests and demonstrations. Videos of school-age girls taking off their hijabs, flipping off photos of the country’s leader and chanting “death to the dictator” have gone viral on Twitter and have garnered nearly 6 million views. 
Iran is no longer able to hide the waning tolerance of the morality police and the worsening situation of normalized violence towards women — something that is extremely damaging to their reputation globally. This has become a worldwide embarrassment as numerous countries have condemned the actions of the Iranian government. But simply condemning their actions is not enough. Countless women have been brutally killed and tortured for simply existing  — it’s long past the time for action.
On Oct. 3, Canada hit 34 Iranian officials and entities with sanctions and criticized the country for their “blatant disregard for human life.” Italy’s Court of Auditors Magistrates Association — the judges’ association who rarely take a biased stance on political issues — have publicly condemned the response to the protests in Iran as well. 
Most recently, the United States announced its newest sanctions which target seven members of Iran’s top leadership after they shut down the country’s internet in order to repress circulation of Amini’s story and diminish the seriousness of the protests. Though this is a terrifying and tumultuous time in Iranian history, this is precisely the warranted response. Citizens are fighting earnestly for their right to personal freedoms — knowing very well that their lives may be the cost. The least other countries can do is stand in solidarity with the women of Iran by hurting the government in a way that hurts — economically.
In the month that has followed since her death, rights groups estimate more than 200 people have died in protest and as many as 14,000 people have been arrested for their involvement. Ironically, the government is currently holding public trials for arrested dissenters, but have continued their impossibly cruel and inexcusable torture regime. 
Arman, whose name has been changed for his safety, tells CNN that his life has not been the same after he was arrested in early October for taking part in the protests. He details the brutal ordeal he faced where he was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, drownings and mock executions. 
Though this account is jaw-dropping enough on its own, other victims of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps shared similar stories and experiences to Arman including rape, threats to their families and post traumatic stress. This however, is not something new to the Iranian government. Informants told CNN that this kind of torture is routine as it goes back to at least 2019 when the government suddenly decided to raise the prices of gas by 50%.
The internet at large can be a deplorable place at times, yet we owe our knowledge of the worsening conditions of day-to-day life in Iran to its existence. Without it, it hurts to think about how much longer this could have gone on without the rest of the world knowing. Though the people of Iran are continuing to suffer on a daily basis and will have to carry the weight of the past in their hearts, the government cannot hide its heinous acts any longer.
In their positions as citizens of an extremely conservative and freedoms-restricted nation, the courage of Iranian nationals — especially female citizens — cannot be overstated. Even though I don’t know what to make of all the most recents events, I sincerely hope that this social media coverage underscores the urgency of the issue in a way that can lead to a proper and swift resolution of the contention that has been building for nearly 40 years.
Despite being over 7,000 miles away from the situation, there is much we can and should do to help turn the tide and end the brutality these women are facing. Use your social media account to spread information on the protests in place for those who have lost access to the internet. Join protests, donate to human rights organizations, write to Congress, keep talking about what is occurring — small individual action can compound on itself to create change only if we all take action. Anything is better than nothing and women like Amini deserve much more than that.

I have a bad case of daddy issues. On some level, I feel many of us have at least some idea what this term means. A young woman who is emotionally unavailable, relies on men for validation and dates either bad or older partners. There is no exact definition, its meaning varies depending on who you ask. Still there is one thing every girl with these issues has in common, she has to have some serious work to do on herself. 
But what if I told you for most of my life I was proud that these two words applied to me. In fact, I even wanted to thank my dad. Even though my father never did much for me, he did manage to teach me one very important lesson. Sometimes I imagine that my dad is like a mirror, it’s reflection showing the exact opposite of everything I desire in life. It shows what would happen if I was never willing to work for anything and think of anyone but myself. My dad taught me that I needed to be strong. 
However, there is a vast difference between understanding the necessity of strength and uncovering it inside of yourself. Resilience to me meant little more than protecting myself. I was in survival mode — the only thing that mattered was that nobody could hurt me the way my dad had. So I built walls in an attempt to eliminate any possibility of rejection. Logically, I knew that my dad left because of his defects and not my own. Yet I had it drilled into the back of my head that I needed to be perfect to make up for this. 
Children of emotionally unavailable parents often form anxious or avoidant attachment styles. I myself have an avoidant style which entails being extremely self-reliant and uncomfortable opening up to people. An attachment style is how secure someone feels in their relationships and how they behave toward others and oftentimes children of two loving, supportive parents have better odds of forming a secure style. A quick Google search and a bit more research will tell you that both anxious and avoidant attachments look a lot like the cliche daddy issues. 
So, why was I so ready to adopt this term? To be honest, I had always known I could use some therapy because of my dad, but it felt natural to poke fun at it. I don’t know whether I used these words first to describe myself or if somebody else did. Nonetheless, I claimed the label with a sense of pride. My daddy issues protected me from getting hurt, and I could not find any fault in that. Or at least that’s what I told myself. But I would be lying if I pretended that each time I heard those words it did not feel a little like getting punched in the stomach.
The term is widely used. Most people seem happy enough to throw it around in conversation rather light-heartedly. And after all, any girl who is described like that deserves it, right? She’s got to be a piece of work. However, I fear that they fail to understand the deeper-rooted problems with these words. Daddy issues condemn a child for their parent’s shortcomings and place blame on the child rather than the father. Maybe if empathy was given instead of judgment and the stigmatization of the phrase, things would have turned out differently. But, there was no empathy for me and I found myself alone — or well, I forced myself to be. 
If I did not need anyone, then nobody had power over me. I repeated that mantra in my head again and again. It was my way of coping with the pain. A promise to myself that I would never let anybody hurt me like my dad did. I constructed a narrative for myself that having daddy issues made it possible for me to build walls around myself. I was convinced that doing this made me strong. 
But gradually, I began to come to the realization that this practice was the opposite of strength. It was fear. I was cowering in the face of my emotions. True strength lies in vulnerability. It is only when I started letting myself feel my emotions that I was able to face my demons. 
We all find different ways to cope with our pain whether that be closing ourselves off emotionally or finding distractions in the world around us. It is all-encompassed in the behaviors linked to daddy issues. However, by reacting to pain in that way, you are only hurting yourself. You are taking on issues that were never yours to begin with. And nobody deserves that. 
But, thank you dad. Truly, you taught me a very important life lesson. Nobody is worth hardening yourself for. Resilience is choosing to feel. It’s being brave enough to face every emotion, even the not so good ones. We are all strong enough to handle the rejection life throws at us. What we need is to trust that even if someone hurts us, we will pick ourselves back up. We will not let them make us think any less of ourselves. 
Simply put, my daddy issues are my daddy’s issues, not mine.

Harry Styles may be from the United Kingdom, but he made the Kia Forum in Los Angeles feel like his home.
Harry Styles is currently performing a residency tour, ending his travels in the City of Angels. He sold out 15 consecutive shows at the Kia Forum throughout October and November. Unfortunately, he was forced to postpone his November 5th, 6th and 7th shows due to illness. I was set to attend his November 7th show, which would have marked his 39th show this residency tour. While I may not have been able to attend my scheduled show, I was fortunate enough to have seen him at his annual Harryween show on Oct. 31st.
As a pop icon, Styles attracted a diverse audience who all took unabashed artistic freedom in fashion choice inspired by his previous attire. Styles once wore a boa during his 2021 Grammy performance and it’s become a standing piece in fans concert attire since. The arena was filled with bold choices that people felt free to express: Bright colors, feathers and platform boots littering the ground. Because it was Halloween, many fans chose to dress up. More than once, “Alice” from Styles’ second film “Don’t Worry Darling” (2022) was spotted amid the crowd.
Styles himself decided to dress up as Danny Zuko from the film “Grease” (1978), alongside his band, who wore decorative outfits from the film’s time period. During the show, he paid tribute to the late Olivia Newton-John with a special rendition of “Hopelessly Devoted To You.” 
With a 360-degree style stage, Styles ensured all sides of the arena felt welcomed into his home. He left no corner untouched: running, jumping with his guitarist, dancing and kicking around to the beat of the music.
While Harry Styles may be most famous for his upbeat songs “Watermelon Sugar” and “As It Was,” he left no emotion behind during the hour and a half stay. His discography connects with so many because of its variety and tendency for the perfect amount of vagueness that allows listeners to relate their own life experiences to every song. While Styles may not be particularly open about his inspiration for many songs, fans are very open about which songs they connect to the most.
“As someone who has never felt like anyone really cared about them, who never felt accepted or wanted, who has felt inherently broken & just believed that’s how it is & that it’s ‘no big deal’ for most of their life, I’ll never be able to thank you enough for “Matilda,” Harry,” @UndeniableLTHS wrote on Twitter. 
Styles also created an environment where fans, particularly queer fans, felt safe to express themselves. During “Treat People With Kindness,” Styles ran up and down the stage with a pride flag. He also spent time during the middle of the show to read signs, aiding three fans in coming out.
“Do you know each other? What’s your name? Jackie and Briana. You would also like help coming out? What’s your name? Kaylie, Kaitlyn, Kaylie, no T. You would also like help coming out!” Styles asked during the show. 
Fan culture highly encapsulates the lives of Harry Styles enthusiasts, even going so far as to influence hundreds of individuals (including myself) to sleep on the street outside of arenas for a chance to see him up close. While the cold weather and lack of sleep may have been brutal, hugging the barricade with one hand and my friend in the other as Styles sang was an experience worth every uncomfortable moment leading up to it.
Throughout the show, Styles engaged his fans in playful banter, catching hats that were thrown his way and egging us on during songs like “Cinema” and “Daydreaming.” In a high-spirited rivalry between U.K. and U.S. fans, the arena went silent during the “leave America” portion of “As It Was.” Styles has clearly picked up on fan-favorite lines, giving the crowd the opportunity to scream (or remain silent) as he listens. 
The show wouldn’t have been complete without a Harry baptism. As always, Styles ended the night by uncapping his water bottle and “baptizing” a section of the pit, running around devilishly before deciding who to choose. A floor-shaking rendition of “Kiwi” sent everyone home. From his first album, he has carried “Kiwi” with him to every show since. It is a fan favorite and adrenaline-pumping night ender. 
While the Kia Forum may not have been his literal house, Harry Styles definitely made it a home for the 17,505 people inside of it this fall.

I used to say my love language was physical touch and had pretty good reason to believe so. 
I began exploring my sexuality at probably too young an age (like oral in middle school if you want the unfortunate details) and have remained adamant that young women deserve the grace to talk about it loudly. I’ll never feel weird about that and hope you don’t either. 
I used to reserve space and significance for what was physical and right in front of me. It kept my overactive imagination at bay. 
However, I’ve spent a lot of time recently pondering the distinction between what is “real” and imagined, but Joan Didion said it doesn’t matter and I’m going to agree with her. I’ve come to know that what really holds weight in my heart are the things that exist beyond the constraints of matter.
The most visceral moments of intimacy and care I have experienced are not the embodiments of desire through locked lips and eyes. They are fleeting moments that slip through your fingers, the figurative earworms finding a home between your headphones. 
Similarly, the best drugs allow you to exchange your physical existence for one beyond the constraints of capillaries and cartilage. They push you beyond the recognizable and inspire inquisitiveness into the looming unknown. They shove you from behind and catch you after you fall through the floor a couple of times. 
Though songs might be constructed by physical instruments or passed around through soundwaves, at its core, music is innately fluid and figureless. It is one of the few things in this world that we cannot grasp yet still remains as vital to humanity as the nutrients we consume.
Despite its definition as a universe that defies physical embodiment, there is nothing that holds me tighter than the pulsing heartbeat of basslines and kickdrums.
The music industry is many things, most of which I don’t align with value-wise, but if there is anything that is understood among each of its constituents, it is that there is something special about live music. 
Often, music is a solitary activity for me – I find solace in the fact that the music is mine in that moment. I spend, maybe to a fault, more of my day listening to my Spotify playlists than I do attuning myself to the environments I find myself in and those that fill it. I’d rather fill silence with a specific queue than leave moments up to the unknown. 
However, concerts are a unique space in which I have always felt safe. 
Last week, I went to what I wholeheartedly believe will remain one of the best concerts I will ever experience for the rest of my life. Brendan Yates and the rest of Turnstile put on a show that deserves nothing less than a 5/5 rating and created one of the most empowering and inviting environments I’ve experienced — and I was being thrown around by men in mosh pits.
There is something oddly reassuring about finding yourself in a sea of people sharing sweat where everyone yells “In a crowd, I’m lonely all the time” from “NEW HEART DESIGN” and it doesn’t feel like a moment of irony. We are lonely. Together. 
Concerts allow for radical community building that I have yet to experience anywhere else. It’s one where your own experiences do not have to falter in order to embrace and contribute to another’s. 
When I have the luxury of attending one, whether it’s at a historical Los Angeles venue or someone’s backyard near campus, any feelings of solitude wash away immediately. Though I might have feelings of loneliness in these crowds, I am simultaneously reassured that that does not mean I am alone.
This sentiment sounds as simple on paper as it feels overwhelming in reality, and it never gets old. 
It is within these venues and spaces of live music that social norms are left at the door. Acts and habits that are typically reserved for solitude are embraced and unbridled among the multitudes of individuals that feel just the same. 
There is no room for inhibitions or contained feelings in these spaces; community is found in these moments of unwavering intuition and expression regardless of whether it’s a result of the drug you took before the show or the concert was inebriating enough on its own. 
Live music unbinds the singularity of being. It renews a commitment to humanity that defies alienation and sutures any social fragmentation. We are reminded that we are in these spaces together. 
Regardless of how hard I may try, we are limited by language when discussing music. The words we do have are often language of capital and spectacle, terms that are tasked with legitimizing sentiments, and they tend to fail in capturing its essence. 
I have written love letters before and tried to create connections by grinding hips, but musical performance is real intimacy in the making. In these moments, the connection between a listener and fellow audience, or the listener and performer, is a stronger relational bond than any physical dynamic one might experience with a partner. 
The performance of music acts as a language to think and feel that is so well understood and communicated (and does not need further elaboration despite me trying yet again) that we can trust to enjoy it even alongside the likes of strangers. 
How special it is to find yourself in a crowd where you don’t know anyone. Because you’ll come to find that you do, and they know you too. Thank god for concerts and intimacy.

Most of us don’t make time to read for fun, let alone to learn something. On top of our class readings, which we may or may not actually do, it can be hard to motivate ourselves to learn on our own time. But, whether you’re stuck on a plane ride home for Thanksgiving or trying to look hot and mysterious on campus, here are a few books to pick up in a free moment.
“The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America” by Richard Rothstein
“The Color of Law” is an eye-opening account outlining the ways that racial segregation continues to affect race relations in America today. Most people recognize the existence of racism, but it is more difficult to understand the complex systems in which it is maintained. Racial discrimination in housing may be less straightforward today, but Rothstein highlights how America became so segregated. Rothstein begins in the 1920s and goes into the modern day, dismantling the myth of de facto segregation that many Americans continue to uphold.
“Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions” by Valeria Luiselli
Working as a translator for undocumented children, Valeria Luiselli offers a unique perspective on the realities of deportation. One of the most valuable aspects of this essay is that it is empathetic without becoming overly emotional. With many stories available about immigration and deportation, they become so heartfelt that it no longer feels unbiased and honest. In “Tell Me How It Ends,” however, Luiselli presents these children as they are: children. They are not a danger to anyone, they are simply trying to live a life with greater opportunity.
“Time is a Mother” by Ocean Vuong
Ocean Vuong’s newest poetry collection, “Time is a Mother,” is a lyrical compilation that provides insight into Vuong’s experience as a queer Asian American. Poetry can be hard to digest for anyone, but Vuong makes it far more engaging and understandable than most. “Time is a Mother” speaks on real and raw issues, such as the death of a parent and growing up as a first-generation American. Vuong is an author that everyone should read, and “Time is a Mother” is the perfect collection for anyone who wants to begin reading poetry.
“The White Album” by Joan Didion
As college students who live in Los Angeles, “The White Album” is a must-read. Not only is this a real-life account of life in the 1960s and ‘70s, but it takes place where we are all spending four years of our lives. Learning about the state of our world is incredibly important, but so is understanding where we live and all the history behind it. Many of Didion’s name drops, such as The Getty, Pacific Coast Highway, and even USC, are far more meaningful to those of us who actually live here. Knowing L.A. is typical for a resident, but knowing its history is something not all of us do.
“The Razor’s Edge” by W. Somerset Maugham
Maugham’s “The Razor’s Edge” is one of the most underappreciated pieces of classic literature. This book has the same feel as “The Great Gatsby,” but without the baggage of having read it your freshman year of high school. The novel revolves around a circle of high-society people in 1919 and takes place over 20 years. This cast of characters includes Larry, who simply wants to loaf around the world, Isabel, who can’t choose between love and money and Elliot, Isabel’s uncle who is eccentric yet a bit snobby. Although the circumstances that Maugham writes about are not ones that we see today, they are fun to read about, and the characters maintain their relatability. 
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by William Shakespeare
It would be impossible to write about works that everyone should read without including a bit of Shakespeare. Whether you love him or hate him, you cannot deny his importance as a literary figure. Not only is Shakespeare mentioned in every English class to ever exist, but he is also referenced in far more pop culture than we realize. “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” is the perfect Shakespearean work for anyone who may be a bit wary. It is certainly one of his staples, and it is also deeply funny. The absurdity of Shakespeare’s comedy is something that sets him apart, and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” certainly plays into that, making it an ideal choice for the modern reader.
“The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin
Anything by James Baldwin is both beautifully written and incredibly insightful. “The Fire Next Time” was written 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, including two of Baldwin’s letters, one to the American people and one to his nephew. These letters discuss the harsh reality of racial tensions in America and how far we still have to go. Baldwin reminds us of an incredibly important moment in history and how racial prejudice has certainly outlasted the institution of slavery.

The new USC women’s basketball team begins their season this week with two games at Galen Center Tuesday and Saturday. The season’s beginning comes after an offseason of immense turnover for the Trojans. Only five players from last season’s roster remain on the current team.  The Trojans will have to adjust to the departure of last year’s leading scorer sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins, who led the team with 14.8 points average per game last season. 
Fortunately, the returners from last year’s squad have the potential to elevate their scoring output and make up for the absence of Jenkins. Sophomore guard /forward Rayah Marshall is one of the Trojans’ key returners. Marshall displayed impressive potential on both ends of the floor last season, her first at USC. She was third on the team in points per game with 11.2, and led the team with 7.7 rebounds per game. 
On the defensive end, Marshall was even more of a force. She was the top freshman in the nation with 2.54 blocks per game, and recorded 1.3 steals per game. All in all, her two-way play earned her a spot on the Pac-12 All-Freshman team. But, Marshall is nowhere near satisfied with how last year went after the Trojans finished tenth in the Pac-12 standings. 
The Trojans were ranked to finish in a similar spot this season (ninth) in both the preseason coaches poll and Pac-12 media poll, and Marshall is intent on proving that wrong. 
“Our preseason ranking is ninth, so that should motivate us to want to go in and just dominate,” Marshall said. 
Another returner who will likely play a vital role on the Trojans is senior guard Alyson Miura. Miura led the Trojans with 38 three-pointers made last season. She hopes to continue to factor in as an elite scoring option on the perimeter this season, but also elevate her game to help the Trojans in lots of other ways. 
“Whatever they need from me this year, that’s what I’m hoping to do, be a great teammate and help us win however we can,” Miura said. 
In addition to the few key returners, the Trojans will rely heavily on talent from the transfer portal to win games this season. The Trojans brought in eight transfers, including four graduate transfers. The abundance of experience has been of great service to the Trojans. 
“We definitely have a lot of experience, and with that comes knowledge and wisdom of the game,” Miura said. 
One transfer who has already proven to be a key addition is graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, who put on a show in the Trojans’ preseason matchup against Cal State Los Angeles with a 25 point, 10 rebound and a double-double. Her 25 points led the team and showed her potential to be an elite scorer this season. In addition to her on-court excellence, the Trojans hope that Sissoko can have an impact on the team as a mentor as well. Particularly, the Trojans are hoping she can serve as a mentor to Marshall as the young, skilled forward continues to learn and grow. 
“I think that Kadi has been a huge help for [Rayah]. That’s really been a great thing for her to be able to learn from Kadi,” Miura said.
Sissoko has had a massive impact on Marshall already. 
“Kadi is just a great player to even watch…when you look at her, you’re motivated like, I wanna do the same thing, every aspect of her game, that’s who I want to look like,” Marshall said.   
Graduate guard Destiny Littleton is another transfer who stands to have a massive impact on the Trojans’ culture beyond just what she brings on the court. Littleton won a national championship last season at South Carolina. Her championship experience will help guide the Trojans to winning ways as they rebound from a tough season and learn how to win as a unit. 
“On the court, probably the one we really lean on is Destiny Littleton…she is the only one who understands what it takes to win a national championship,” said new Associate Head Coach Beth Burns. 
Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb further emphasized the importance of winning experience by hiring Burns as the new associate head coach this offseason. Burns has a multitude of experience leading schools like University of Louisville to tournament runs as an assistant, and is the winningest head coach in San Diego State women’s basketball history. 
Burns focuses mainly on defense and discipline, which is very different to Gottlieb’s emphasis on offense and maintaining personal relationships with the players.
“I’m just trying to help her with details and structure and how to function day to day, so our culture going forward is a successful and winning one,” Burns said. 
Fortunately, the two are on the same page about how to take their team to the top and their styles should serve to complement one another well as they aim to build a well-rounded team. 
“When you come in new and you have people from so many different colleges…[some details] sound like pedestrian things but when you’re building a team [they’re] not. You have to have like minded people,” Burns said. 
With so much turnover, it’s almost ironic that the Trojans are projected to finish in almost the exact same spot as they finished last season. With such a different team full of winning potential, the Trojans have an opportunity to surprise a lot of people if their new unit works as well as Gottlieb and Burns hope it does. 
Marshall is confident the team will turn it around, and doesn’t want students to miss the games at Galen Center this season. 
“We’re looking forward to giving them a show,” Marshall said. 
The Trojans will hope to pick up some wins and build momentum to start the season as they face off against Idaho State University at 7 p.m. Saturday night.

USC committed a season-high 12 penalties for a total of 93 yards in their 43-42 loss to Utah, but there was one in particular that seemed to shut the door on the Trojans’ chances to squeak out a victory.
Utah had just taken the lead for the first time in the game with just 48 seconds remaining and suddenly an undefeated start and whispers of playoff potential seemed doomed to vanish into thin air. However, freshman running back Raleek Brown returned Utah’s kickoff down the middle of the field, swerving around defenders until he finally was tackled just a few yards shy of the 50- yard -line.
For a moment, the clouds above Salt Lake City separated and a ray of hope shone down on the USC sideline. Brown got up from the ground and clapped his hands together. With redshirt freshman kicker Denis Lynch having hit a 45-yard field goal earlier in the season against Stanford, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and the USC offense would have to gain around 18 yards to set Lynch up for what would be a game-winning field goal.
Lynch never got the chance. A holding penalty negated Brown’s big return and instead the Trojans started on their own 20-yard line — with a false start penalty on the following play pushing USC back yet another 5 yards. 
Williams and the Trojan offense, backed up near their own end zone, weren’t able to pick up the yardage necessary, and as the clock struck triple zeros, the diehard Utah fan base rushed the field to celebrate the victory.
“You’re going to have some nights where the calls don’t go your way, and they certainly did not tonight,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley. “I’m not going to be the guy out there saying we lost the game from the officiating because we didn’t.”
Against UC Berkeley on Saturday, USC special teams once again put pressure on the Trojans at times. After going down 7-0 early in the game to California, the Trojans quickly found the end zone thanks to a 1-yard Williams touchdown run. As Lynch lined up to kick the extra point, an area of special teams where the freshman has been automatic all year, chaos ensued. 
Redshirt senior long snapper Jac Casasante’s snap flew over the head of redshirt junior punter Will Rose, who was set to hold the snap for Lynch’s kick. Rose immediately began sprinting towards the retreating football and dove on it unsuccessfully. A California defender picked it up and headed towards the opposite end zone where a rare two points awaited the Bears. 
Lynch caught up to the ballhandler and tackled him, but as the Bears fell back, he pitched the football behind him to a teammate, who took off for another few yards before finally being tackled.
“We had a tough snap, and Jac’s been money for us all year,” Riley said. “Those are going to happen … and honestly, our guys did a hell of a job getting them on the ground, even after the lateral.”
Later in the game, the Bears recovered a surprise onside kick after scoring a touchdown, proceeding to score again and bring the game within one touchdown — with redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa blocking California’s extra point attempt to protect the Trojans from being up just 6 points. 
“You had some monster plays right? The Figueroa block, I mean how important was that in the game?” Riley said. “It looked like, to me, on the [onside kick] that we were in place, we just didn’t field the ball on the onside kick.”
Special teams clearly have an impact on the game. While there is an ongoing debate amongst football coaches and analysts on just how important the oft-forgotten third side of the ball is, special teams made a difference in both the Utah and California games. 
Before the California  game, USC ranked No. 87 in the nation in kick return defense. They have been flagged seven times on special teams, costing a total of 73 yards. The Trojans have struggled on both punt returns and punt return defense. 
Because of this, it is notable that USC does not have a special teams coach among the 29 coaches on staff. The team’s Senior Special Team Analyst Ryan Dougherty is on staff but is unable to communicate with USC’s special team players during games. 
With only 11 on-field coaches allowed during games, Riley does not want to sacrifice a spot for special teams.
“I don’t believe in a singular special teams coordinator,” Riley said in an interview with WeAreSC. “Not with the current limits on staff.” 
With several USC coaches having experience as special teams coordinators in the past, Riley feels it unnecessary to let their current staff’s wisdom go to waste. 
“As we put together the staff, it was with that plan in mind,” Riley said.
With just three games remaining in what has been a complete turnaround season compared to the Trojans’ 4-8 finish last year, USC has two tough opponents remaining. Notre Dame, who just upset No. 4 Clemson University , and UCLA, who dismantled Utah earlier in the season, will be essential victories for USC’s chances at a Pac-12 Championship or College Football Playoff berth.
Williams and USC’s high-flying offense and their struggling defense might make the most impact throughout the games, but a spotty special team could be the nail in the coffin if things go wrong for the Trojans. 
USC will face Colorado Friday at 6:30 p.m. in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Earlier this semester, I was looking for tickets to the upcoming USC-UCLA game — which is going to have serious implications for the Pac-12 Championship and College Football Playoffs. Since the game was away at the Rose Bowl, my student season ticket that I already paid for would not work for this game. So, I went on ticketing sites like StubHub, Ticketmaster and SeatGeek only to find that the prices were exceeding $100 , and now the lowest ticket price sits at a whopping $176 —  which is almost the cost of my entire season ticket pass — at the time of me writing this column. I understand that it is one of the biggest games of the season for both teams, but that is simply too high for college students. 
Luckily, USC’s ticket office had a lottery for USC students to get up to two  tickets for the upcoming game at $65 each, and I was able to get the two entries. What is bewildering was that I paid a total of $130 for these two tickets, while people who were not lucky enough to get a ticket through this lottery will have to pay $40 to $50 more for just a single ticket. 
Compared to other colleges across the country, a ticket under $200 is a steal. For instance, the No. 1 University of Tennessee vs. No. 3 University of Georgia game in Athens, Georgia had its cheapest ticket at $568.  To get better seats near the 50-yard line cost  over $3,000. Looking forward to the Big Ten matchup between Ohio State and Michigan in Columbus, Ohio a few weeks from now on Nov. 26, the cheapest ticket on VividSeats is $429. 
These prices are just for regular-season games. If I wanted to check out early prices for games like the Rose Bowl next year, they start at $461 on Ticketmaster. Additionally, the College Football National Championship starts out at $684 on the same site. 
This issue doesn’t only affect college football but other sports, like basketball, as well. Even though home games are free for USC students, if I want to go to an away game, prices are going to go up again. For example, the cheapest ticket for our first matchup against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion is $64.  It’s not terrible, but pretty expensive compared to the free home games.
What is even more frustrating is that the prices I have been listing don’t include the processing fees, an additional charge that is often a percentage of the ticket cost. Fees range from $12 to $50, or even higher. 
So, there are two ways to combat these high prices. One is obviously removing these processing and other fees. The Biden Administration is already investigating the removal or lowering of such fees for entertainment and travel tickets which can save over $1 billion for purchasers. The Biden Administration hopes to minimize the power of these ticket companies,  who can  add surprise fees however they want and allow Americans to save money as well. Hopefully, at the federal level, this issue can be dealt with properly. 
Then, the other way is to limit the resale of tickets. The ticket resale business is huge, with companies mass-buying tickets early on and raising the prices so they can make a profit. Also known as ticket scalping, there are no major federal laws that prohibit the process. At the state level, the laws are pretty lenient and mostly directed toward people who resell tickets illicitly outside venues.
Overall, by challenging processing fees and ticket reselling practices, the prices for college athletics can be affordable. This will help out college students who are already paying so much for tuition, housing and other expenses, watch their peers compete.
