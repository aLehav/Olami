Allen Bradford has to be used to the challenges by now.
After entering fall practice as the projected starting running back, the official depth chart released by USC coach Lane Kiffin last week shows Bradford again short of the starting role. Redshirt junior Marc Tyler will start against Hawai’i on Thursday. Bradford will surely get his carries, but he wants that starting job.
But just when Bradford seemed so close, it all could be slipping away.
A knee bruise he suffered earlier in the month has had a lot to do with holding him back, and he is still not quite 100 percent. Coaches have also said, however, Tyler has been the more consistent back.
Bradford maintained that he’s remaining focused and is not giving up on claiming the starting role. But when he talked about being passed up for the starting job, his head hung slightly and he was unable to hide the disappointment in his voice.
“I wasn’t as consistent in fall camp, so I’ve just got to bounce back,” Bradford said. “I’ve got to just be Allen Bradford and continue to fight.”
You cannot blame Bradford for being frustrated. It has not been an easy road for the fifth-year senior from San Bernardino, Calif.
He was recruited to USC as a safety in 2006 but soon moved to tailback. He saw the field quite a bit but not in the role he had imagined. His freshman year he spent some of the season at fullback to help out with depth issues.
The next two years were a bit of a blur. Bradford got lost in the shuffle, just another name among the stable of running backs that split time at the position under former coach Pete Carroll. In 2008, he had season-ending hip surgery.
Then the whispers began.
There was talk that he would transfer, that he was dissatisfied. Three years at USC and he had little to show for it: a couple of touchdowns maybe, but still a tenuous draft status.
Last season Bradford finally got his chance. It came in the middle of the season in the form of a 147-yard, two-touchdown performance against Oregon State, earning Bradford Pac-10 Player of the Week honors.
Bradford seemed to have finally received what he had sought all these years: recognition. The uphill portion of the journey seemed to be behind him.
He soon developed into the Trojans’ most reliable back. He ended up second on the team in total rushing yards with 668, just behind then-junior Joe McKnight.
Bradford started only one game, but with McKnight moving on to the NFL, he was primed to step into the starting role in his last chance at USC to make a name for himself.
And then he ran into the same obstacle that he had trouble overcoming previously in his career: injury.
Tyler, a close friend and former roommate of Bradford’s, will instead have the first crack at solidifying himself at USC. There is not the least hint of bad blood between the teammates, Bradford says. The tailback still regularly gives Tyler — who is a year younger — advice.
“I tell him the little things that he’s doing wrong,” Bradford said. “I tell him, ‘Just keep the ball up, and you got to go out there and pace yourself.’”
Bradford’s patience might need pacing as well. After already having endured so much adversity, the running back likely has much more ahead.
When he thinks of the competition he has faced, trying to assert himself in USC’s crowded backfield, he draws on words of wisdom from his father.
“My dad always told me that you compete with yourself,” Bradford said on usctrojans.com, USC’s official athletic website. “You can’t control what everybody else does, you can only control what you do.”
That’s why, when Bradford found out the news about Tyler, after calling his dad, he said he looked within himself.
“I looked at myself in the mirror because I know I’ve been through a lot, and it’s just another challenge that I have to embrace,” he said.
Looking back on Bradford’s history at USC, you want to believe that he’s going to break through at any moment, hit his stride and be the starting running back at USC and maybe move to the next level.
Whether that day ever becomes reality is uncertain. But one thing is for sure: Allen Bradford will continue to fight his never-ending battle against the man in the mirror.

The USC women’s cross-country team experienced an up-and-down season in 2009, and coach Tom Walsh is hoping better luck and a group of new contributors will improve the Women of Troy’s performance on the course.
Born to run · Senior Zsofia Erdelyi looks to rebound from injury and an underwhelming 2009 season to lead the Women of Troy in 2010. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
“I think we can take a step forward,” Walsh said. “This is a competitive group and they are all looking forward to the 2010 season to try and improve.”
That improvement likely hinges on whether USC can stay healthy. Injuries and illness prevented the Women of Troy from running at full strength until the end of the 2009 season and contributed to some disappointing performances at important meets. At the 2009 Pac-10 championships, USC could only muster a ninth-place finish.
Most of the runners affected by these setbacks, however, will get a second chance. USC will return several key pieces from its 2009 squad, none more important than senior Zsofia Erdelyi, USC’s highest-place finisher at the NCAA West Regionals race last year.
Erdelyi, who qualified for the NCAA championships in 2008, failed to do so last year after running a slower time in the regional meet than the Pac-10 meet. Erdelyi’s inconsistent 2009 season paralleled her team’s struggles, but Walsh believes the problems are a thing of the past.
“Zsofia’s season [in 2009] was a fluke,” Walsh said. “She got off to a bit of a slow start because of injuries and in cross-country that can hurt you. The season is so short that if you don’t get on track early, you end up playing catch up.”
Among the rest of the returning ranks are sophomore Kathleen Moloney, who had what Walsh called “an outstanding freshman season,” and senior Christine Cortez, who arrived last year as a transfer from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif., and emerged as one of USC’s strongest runners.
Despite the solid group of returners, it’s the newcomers that provide the most reason for excitement. Redshirt sophomore Shelby Buckley, who was forced to sit out last season because of her intra-conference transfer from UCLA, is expected to make an immediate contribution.
“We’re really excited about Shelby,” Walsh said. “She’s got great credentials. We can’t wait to see what she can do for us.”
Walsh also anticipates incoming freshmen Jaclyn Walles and Katie DeYoung to make an impact. Walles won the Los Angeles City Championship for Venice High School in her junior year, and DeYoung is a formidable long-distance runner from Serra Catholic in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
USC still faces an uphill climb, however. In terms of overall dominance, the Pac-10 might be the best conference in all of collegiate women’s cross-country. Powerhouses like Oregon, Stanford and Washington annually field national championship contenders, and the rest of the conference produces tough competition year after year.
Despite a strong field of opponents, Walsh and his team aren’t backing down. The coach put together what he calls a “challenging, but not overwhelming” schedule that begins Sept. 11 at the UC Irvine Invitational and includes a trip back to the Stanford Invitational the following week. It’s Stanford that Walsh has circled on his calendar as a marquee meet.
“I’m really looking forward to it because we did so poorly there last year,” Walsh said. “We need to make up for that. It’s a very important meet for us.”
USC will also travel to Cal State Northridge and the Titan Invitational in Fullerton, Calif., before competing in the Pac-10 championships on Oct. 30.

One day before leaving for Hawaii, the USC football team voted sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and seniors Shareece Wright (cornerback), Stanley Havili (fullback), Michael Morgan (linebacker) and Malcolm Smith (linebacker) as team captains.
Leadership · Despite his youth, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley was named one of the five captains for USC’s 2010 season. He returns to the helm of a Trojan offense looking to capitalize on a bevy of returning experience and young talent.  - Eric Wolfe | Daily Trojan.
USC coach Lane Kiffin said he initially planned to have four captains, but a tie between Morgan and Smith left the team with five. Barkley, the only non-senior among the captains, was an easy choice, according to several players.
“I feel like he did a good job of being a leader out here,” Wright said. “He’s the head of our team as the quarterback.”
Kiffin added that Barkley’s intensity earned him the nod over worthy senior candidates such as wide receiver Ronald Johnson, center Kris O’Dowd and tailback Allen Bradford.
“For him to be named over those guys as a sophomore says something about his work ethic,” Kiffin said. “The [other players] have seen how he’s changed his body and his approach to the game. He wants to be the best and he’s working for it.”
Several of the players selected have been involved in off-the-field incidents at USC. Wright was declared academically ineligible for the 2009 season and was charged with resisting arrest in 2008.
“The time came for me and it’s a blessing,” he said. “It shows that my teammates know what type of player I am and what type of person I am.”
Wright added that he thought he could be a good representative of the team.
Havili, widely regarded as a team leader and solid locker room presence, punched teammate junior cornerback T.J. Bryant during training camp. Bryant required surgery on his cheekbone after the incident. Kiffin said Havili’s selection demonstrated what the team thought of him.
“I think it says exactly what we felt about what happened,” he said. “It was a surprise. It was a very poor decision by him and one that was out of character.”
Johnson said the five players selected were the right choices.
“The guys that were chosen were the vocal guys and the guys who stand out,” Johnson said. “I think [they] deserved it.”
u
Kiffin reiterated his commitment to special teams Monday after practice, pointing out how much time the team had spent working on drills and technique.
“We’re not just giving it lip service and saying we’re going to play really well on special teams,” Kiffin said. “We’re going to dedicate our time and resources to it.”
Johnson, who is slated to return punts for the first time since high school, said the team is excited to put all that extra practice to use.
“Everybody’s bought in [to special teams] and we can’t wait to show what we can do on the field,” he said.
u
Kiffin announced that freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater, who made waves during camp with his hands and physicality, might redshirt this season because of nagging injuries.
“His competitive side wants to fight through that and go out there but he’s just not 100 percent,” Kiffin said. “We feel like he’s going to be so good when he is that we don’t want to throw him out when he’s not.”
Redshirt sophomore center Abe Markowitz will need surgery after breaking a bone in his foot. Kiffin said he would miss six or seven weeks.

USC noted a recent improvement in air quality scores surrounding campus, a  result of the many efforts the university is taking to become more environmentally friendly, transportation officials said.
Part of this success can be attributed to USC’s exclusive partnership with Zimride, a ridesharing service that hosts a social networking website that organizes potential carpoolers into one vehicle, said Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation.
“The program helps students, staff and faculty find other friends within their trusted community to reduce their transportation-related carbon footprint,” said John Zimmer, co-founder of Zimride.
The service has also contributed to changes at USC in its attempts to minimize the environmental problems that arise from the heavy traffic often seen around Downtown Los Angeles.
“We have increased our South Coast Air Quality Management District commuter survey score year over year since 2006, with milestone scores being recorded in 2009 and 2010,” Mazza said.
USC sold approximately 250 carpool passes for the 2010-2011 school year, which is consistent with those sold in years past. Currently, most of those who carpool to campus are faculty and staff. However, USC is encouraging commuter students to be more receptive to carpooling with fellow classmates as their primary mode of transportation, Mazza said.
The university is using the collaboration with Zimride as a starting point for more “green” initiatives they hope to establish throughout campus for students.
“In the last three years we have purchased several hybrid and low-emission vehicles as well as eight propane-powered buses,” Mazza said.
USC Transportation also offers subsidized mass transit permits, subsidized van pools, Zipcar and a free shuttle to and from Union Station and L.A. Live on the weekends.
Zimride was created at Cornell University, and now works with more than 55 other universities across the country. It has become grown in the Southern California area, and is in use at schools such as UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine and UCLA.
The program also incorporates its services with other social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The company has developed an application that offers students a quicker way to register and find a carpool that matches their specific needs.
“The Facebook integration not only makes it user-friendly but provides an added layer of trust in conjunction with the restricted USC community-only access,” Mazza said.
Zimride offers approximately 154,000 available commutes and has close to 3,000 members from the USC community.
USC hopes that Zimride will appeal to commuter students, as well as those who reside on campus but do not have reliable access to a car, Mazza said.
Some students said the service would make traveling easier.
“I don’t have a car with me on campus, so having something like this to use when I want to travel to other places in Southern California or anywhere else is really convenient,” said Michiko Morri, a senior majoring in psychology. “It gives me more flexibility if I want to plan a trip somewhere. Plus, it seems like a great way to reduce traffic and help out the environment at the same time.”
USC is looking to further educate students about its “green” transportation options by advertising Zimride around campus and through the USC Transportation Facebook page.
“We are hoping to put together some student-organized street teams this semester to help educate the campus community about all of our commuter offerings,” Mazza said.
The steps being taken by the younger generation are wonderful – that they are aware of the problem of pollution, and are innovating ways to reduce it.  It tells me that the future will be bright.

USC has become the first university in the world to be designated an “international safe community” by the World Health Organization Collaboration Centre on Community Safety Promotion, a designation indicating a strong network of collaboration that works toward the safety and wellness of a community.
Usually, cities and municipalities receive the honor.
“It indicates that USC is very serious about the safety and the well-being of students, faculty and staff,” said Charles E. Lane, associate senior vice president for Career and Protective Services. “We actually are very sincere, and we put serious efforts into making sure it happens at many, many different levels. Not just the obvious levels, but many that go on behind the scenes.”
The university is the first institution of higher education to apply, said Donna Stein-Harris, director of the U.S. National Safety Council’s Safe Communities America efforts.
Applicants first go through an application process and then an auditing period before they receive the designation.
“We just are very pleased with how USC has approached this. They really will be the leaders in this movement as more universities understand the value of this kind of designation of honor,” said Stein-Harris, who helped audit the university.
Ed Becker, director of USC’s Environmental Health & Safety department, said he first approached the university with the idea of seeking the designation when he realized USC’s community was very much like a city.
“We’re the first university that recognized that the collaborative and the holistic approach [of USC] was similar to that of a municipality. We have police, and policies and procedures, transportation issues,” Becker said.
Becker and Lane began the application process by creating the USC Safe Communities Task Force, which originally sought  to compile and list the groups and initiatives on campus that encouraged safety and well-being.
Eventually, Becker said, the task force became a driving coalition to create and enact change toward creating a safer campus.
“The process is fairly malleable in that it allows you to identify what your target groups are,” Becker said. “It’s challenging [to get] groups of people that may have not met in the past or that don’t work on a daily basis together behind a single purpose.”
At first, the task force focused on traffic safety around campus areas with heavy bike traffic and few stoplights. The task force will meet to discuss risk factors and propose solutions as well as how to best address issues on campus this year.
It is this collaborative approach to risks and safety, Stein-Harris said, that made USC stand out for the designation.
“It’s recognition that there are risks out there, but the designation is based on the community — in this case, the campus’ approach to risk management. If they have a process for dealing with these kinds of incidents,” Stein-Harris said.
Lane acknowledged, however, that a safe community designation does not necessarily mean a crime-free community.
“We’re not saying that we’re the safest community. We have processes in place that try to get us to become the safest community,” Lane said. “Organizations that don’t have this in place aren’t in a position necessarily to react to problems that come up like we might be able to.”
Though the topic of crime around the University Park Campus did come up during the audit, Lane said the efforts of the university to coordinate with the Los Angeles Police Department was one of the collaborative efforts the Safe Communities designation recognizes.
“We just wanted to make sure we identified many of the issues,” Lane said. “It’s not like we park those on the side, because we continue to address those all the time.”

The Sunset Strip has been known as a place where music makes an imprint on history. What better way to celebrate music other than shutting down a section of Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood for a music festival?
Seeing stars · Popular acts Kid Cudi (top) and Travie McCoy offer classic tracks as well as their newest works to loyal festival goers. - Jenay Ross | Daily Trojan 
The third-annual Sunset Strip Music Festival, on Aug. 26-28, remained just as unique as in past years. All three days were filled with a variety of shows located at the The Roxy Theatre, Whisky A Go-Go, Viper Room, Key Club, Cat Club and the House of Blues. It isn’t every day a person can walk into some of Hollywood’s most famous clubs on a given day.
Out of all the shows available during the three days, Saturday was the best night. There were additional outdoor performances on two stages, one on San Vicente and the other on Doheny. It was aural paradise, the music booming through the hills of Hollywood as people from all walks of life enjoyed the wide array of performers and food trucks lined up in the middle of everything. Among The Greasy Wiener, Shrimp Pimp, Greez Wheez and Dosa trucks, the Grilled Cheese truck grabbed the most attention with its inventive, customizable menu.
Saturday was by far the busiest day. More than 50 diverse bands, including Lady Sinatra, Nikki & Rich, The Divine, John West and The Lonely Drunks Club Band, took the same stages where Mötley Crüe, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, The Doors and many other rock legends once performed. During an interview on the 98.7 FM stage in the Viper Room, Nikki Sixx from Mötley Crüe reminisced about when he hung out on the Strip as a teenager and his Motley Crue days when he realized the Strip was the “destination place to play.”
Slash, the 2010 SSMF honoree, drew one of the largest crowds of the day with fans taking up the majority of the room on the street and sidewalks ­— even standing on brick walls to get a better view of the stage.
Slash’s performance was full of life, with heavy, driven riffs that blew everyone away. His solo touring band, including lead vocalist Myles Kennedy, was there to back him up as he shredded away on his guitar though it was clear he was still the main focus.
Bridging a gap between the old and new generation, younger performers also graced the two outdoor stages. Travie McCoy was all smiles during his performance on the West Stage, interacting with the audience members as if they were one huge group of friends and appreciating their love for music and Los Angeles. His playfulness and excitement shone through in his upbeat stage presence, signature funny faces and songs, such as “Critical,” his hit single “Billionaire” and even a Gym Class Heroes throwback from 2007, “Cupid’s Chokehold.”
Other hip-hop acts included Common and Kid Cudi on the East Stage. Although Common had a 30-minute delay because of technical difficulties, his fans waited for him. When Kid Cudi came on after Common, a sea of people waited as the sun began to set. A couple of people right against the barricade had waited hours to see Cudi and lost the feeling in their legs, but they found it all well worth it.
Before the street fest came to a close, The Smashing Pumpkins, with the last remaining original member Billy Corgan, lit up the entire street with colorful stage lights and pure rock ‘n’ roll energy. Covering both old classics, such as “Bullet with Butterfly Wings” and “Tonight, Tonight” as well as new favorites, they were the perfect closers for the show to remind everyone the purpose of the festival: to celebrate and honor music legends and the history that has created an epic path through the Sunset Strip.

Brian Ralston — renowned film composer and graduate of Thornton School of Music’s Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television program — was once an emergency medical technician involved in clinical research for pharmaceutical companies and poised to apply to medical school. For any artist, starving or not, a career in medicine is a clear antithesis.
His turn to music was not without context. Ralston’s adolescence was defined by music. Beginning in first grade, Ralston was given private piano training and continued with lessons for 11 years before transitioning to the trumpet as a principal instrument. All the while, he was composing scores and organizing the music in his head.
When it came time to decide on colleges, Ralston chose the University of Arizona for its biochemistry program. After college, Ralston seemed to have made peace with a career in medicine.
“I completed my degree, became a nationally certified EMT and worked for a neurologist for three years,” Ralston said. “I loved the science of medicine and loved helping people.”
Nonetheless, Ralston’s passion for music always permeated his lifestyle, even when it wasn’t a critical focus.
“I would sometimes write music and re-score movie scenes on my own at the piano or a keyboard sitting in front of the TV in my dorm room,” Ralston said. He was also a performer in several prominent music ensembles, including the Pride of Arizona Marching Band.
While inundated with research assignments and medical school applications, Ralston came to a point where the music in his head was no longer negligible. It was blaring louder than ever before, and for the first time in years, Ralston really listened.
“I ultimately had a soul-searching moment,” Ralston said. “I came to the conclusion that in order to be truly happy in life, one has to follow their passion against all odds. I just did not have the courage until then to follow that dream.”
In response to this call, Ralston attended formal music theory and composition courses at the University of Arizona and was later accepted into USC’s scoring program in 2001.
“Upon graduation from USC, I got my first broadcast opportunity because of my USC participation,” Ralston said.
Since then, Ralston has been invited to compose for Luke Kasdan on his feature film debut Don’t Fade Away and Bob Degus, producer of Pleasantville. Ralston was also brought on to orchestrate and arrange an original musical, titled SnEauX! The SINsational Gothic Figure Skating Musical. The show was such a hit that it was nominated for six L.A. Weekly Theater Awards.
With values deeply rooted in music and a supportive family, what caused Ralston to deviate from a career in the arts? The answer lies in an area that is somewhat understated when it comes to following one’s dreams: societal constructs. This includes not only media influence but also impressions made by friends, teachers, counselors and other authority figures.
For obvious reasons, the traditional representation of compromise begins and ends in the home. Although true in some respects and certainly more prevalent in previous generations, it is not always the parents that mandate a medical career for their offspring.
“I was always involved in music and had a talent for it, but it seems no one really believes that you can make it a career,” Ralston said. “For myself, my parents have been nothing but supportive in my choice years ago to abandon a possible career in medicine for one in music. But I have heard many words of discouragement along the way.”
Oftentimes, young people are hesitant to express their true passions to others because society has made them believe there are five successful composers and the other 10,000 wait tables between recording sessions. Society has constructed a lens that contorts how young adults view artists. Yes, aspiring to be as brilliant as John Williams or Hans Zimmer should be a lofty goal, but who were either of these men at 17? They were just two talented musicians, faced with the same obstacles and the same fears.
Ralston was clearly affected by this construct, but what his story serves to say is that it is never too late to pursue your passion. At USC, we are blessed by a university staff that encourages the adoption of minors and possible changes in majors, and that campaigns for the arts in a visible way.
If in the end we fall, then perhaps we look in a different direction. But until that day, why do we insist on subtracting from the passions of talented individuals? Why do we stifle their dreams in high school instead of allowing them to construct a résumé that will give them a chance to succeed in that field? What if we started earlier and planned to be musicians at 12 or 13? No one should ever be made to feel ashamed of his passion, especially before he’s been given the chance to explore it.
Without regret, we must soldier on, for anything we have done or will do is but a necessary step. For Ralston, becoming an EMT was essential to his growth as an individual and an artist. He needed to study for the MCATS, score TV shows in his dorm room and search within his soul before dedicating his life to music.
He always had the gift.

At dusk on Sunday afternoon, near the end of his band’s set during the Independence Jam in Oceanside, Calif., The Whigs frontman Parker Gispert sat down at a keyboard.
Beach day · The Independence Jam event featured a unique location along the coast and original bands, including a variety of San Diego acts, as well as The Whigs and Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. - Zach Cannon | Daily Trojan 
“We tour a lot,” he said. “And a lot of towns have names for these cities, and they don’t really resonate. I think Oceanside is pretty spot-on.”
He’s right. Not just an apropos name for the city, Oceanside describes the stage The Whigs played on. Tucked under the pier not 10 yards from the sand, the small Oceanside Pier Plaza Amphitheatre might be better suited for community luau groups than large rock concerts. That didn’t stop San Diego’s FM 94.9 from hosting its Independence Jam there for a second time, and it made for the perfect venue to see the headliners for the night: Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros.
Eight groups played between two stages Sunday. White Apple Tree opened the afternoon at 4:30 p.m. Along with The Burning of Rome, The Nervous Wreckords and The Silent Comedy, these smaller San Diego bands were relegated to the “local stage” in the parking lot adjacent to the amphitheater. They served as a half-hour musical interlude while the larger bands broke down and set up the amphitheater stage.
The crowd didn’t dissipate much between the short sets at the amphitheater and with good reason: Everyone wanted a great spot for Edward Sharpe.
Delta Spirit opened the main stage at 5 p.m., followed by The Whigs. Early in their set, a fan stood at the front of the crowd holding up a sign asking, “Can I play bass on ‘Hot Bed’?” When The Whigs reached that song at the end of their set, they brought the fan onstage and Tim Deaux handed over his bass. “His name’s Peter, my name’s Parker, and together, we’re Spider-Man,” Gispert yelled.
Rogue Wave, a fun, summery band from Oakland, Calif. opened with “Stars and Stripes” just after sunset. Its peppy, melodic sound perfectly matched the locale. The crowd slowly filled in and as the band encouraged everyone to clap along to “We Will Make a Song Destroy,” part of the drum set fell over, a product, according to lead singer Zach Schwartz (aka Zach Rogue), of fans “rocking too hard with your rocking energy.” With “Kicking the Heart Out,” it closed out its show, and its crew made space for Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros.
And they needed a lot of it. With 12 members playing a variety of instruments, including an accordion, a violin, a ukulele, two drum sets, two keyboards, two guitars and a few tambourines, lead singers Alex Ebert and Jade Castrinos weren’t left with much room to wiggle and dance around the stage.
That didn’t stop them, however. And as if that wasn’t cramped enough, Ebert jumped down into the crowd multiple times, intensifying the emotional, jovial spark already present in the songs.
Take the plucky “Janglin.” Easily recognizable as the track from the Ford Fiesta commercials, Ebert and co. started their show with it, and could have shut off the microphones at any moment. Already, the crowd was singing along.
Before launching into “Forty Days,” Ebert asked the crowd, “Y’all want to do some stomping around?” and each time his foot landed, drummer Josh Collazo kicked the bass drum. On “Up From Below,” Collazo laid down a fast, swingy beat — one not present on the album — one of the many touches that increased the vivacity of the show.
That energy built through their signature song, “Home.” By the time Ebert and Castrino started their recognizable whistle, the entire crowd was on its feet, jumping, stomping and clapping.
When Ebert and Castrino turned to each other and ad-libbed their duet — “Jade?” “Hi, Alex.” “Remember that time we went down to Mexico?” — the emotion between the two was palpable. It personified the fun, communal spirit of Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. If there were a roof over that amphitheater, it would have been blown right off the place.
And then the one drawback of the outdoor venue hit: noise ordinances. After just seven songs, the band ended its show at 10 p.m. The members did come back for an encore, allowing fans to flood the stage. So many joined them, Ebert and Castrino disappeared for a bit among a throng of people.
When they resurfaced, they looked all right with it. There, on the beach surrounded by their adoring fans, they looked like they were at home.

On a Sunday night rife with anticipation, a chill of unease could be felt at the Hollywood Bowl as the second-to-last show of KCRW’s World Festival began. Throughout the gaping amphitheater, there were concerns that the evening’s dance-heavy show, headlined by U.K. electro wizards The Chemical Brothers, would be hindered by the constrictive layout of the venue.
Flashing lights · The Chemical Brothers used graphics to amplify their performance, playing hits such as “Galvanize” and “Believe” in a set that alternated between upbeat dance songs and more meditative tracks. - Ted Gerike | Daily Trojan 
Indeed, one could say band members Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, along with supporting acts Chromeo and YACHT, went into the evening with the decks stacked against them. If anything, the show would be the ultimate test for each act, gauged by whether or not their respective beats and hooks could coax concertgoers from their assigned seats and terrace boxes.
The festivities started underwhelmingly with YACHT, a Portland electro-pop outfit with an apparent fetish for three-note riffs, poppy sing-alongs and not much else. Despite the band’s somewhat endearing energy, the audience members picked at their picnic dinners and wine while frontman Jona Bechtolt bounced about in a white suit, searching for a few interested souls to grab onto.
By the time Montreal hip-hop all-stars Chromeo took the stage, just after sunset, the venue had filled to capacity and seemed ready to party, with some even rising from their seats to dance. Due credit must go to the infectiously cool stage personas of Dave 1 and P-Thugg, respectively channeling French greasers and Bronx gangsters via dress, noodling away at their vintage synths and shredding guitars without a hint of irony. Between hits like “Bonafied Lovin’,” “Momma’s Boy” and the recently released “Night By Night,” the duo also took turns at making small talk with the enthusiastic crowd.
“We don’t say ‘creampuff,’ we don’t say ‘sweetheart,’ we don’t say ‘girlfriend.’ We say … ‘Tenderoni’,” Dave 1 murmured, before launching into the song. Much of the crowd followed willingly, with cheers and some gyrating hips.
Though Chromeo left the crowd notably more invigorated than YACHT, ending its set at 8:20 p.m., it remained unclear whether the entire bowl would soon be transformed into the usual sea of shimmying body parts that can be witnessed at most Chemical Brothers concerts — in 2000, the duo played to the largest crowd ever seen at England’s legendary Glastonbury Festival.
Coming off a summer of Tchaikovsky and Debussy, it was  evident that many of the season pass holders in the crowd had little idea of what sounds to expect from Rowlands and Simons’ hulking island of samplers and synthesizers.
The spectacle opened with something of a false start, as the lights slowly dimmed and The Chemical Brothers emerged from the darkness, backed by the Beatles’ “Tomorrow Never Knows.” The applause was surprisingly thin, as if half the bowl had missed the emergence of the two men.
Thankfully, as the first chords of “Galvanize” screamed out across the hillsides, the duo assured the crowd that its entrance would be the only unremarkable aspect of the night.
Backed by a towering LED screen and flanked by neon lasers that traced colorful spider webs across the sky, The Chemical Brothers delivered an earth-shaking set that can be fairly described as brilliant in composition and storytelling, the latter of which is too often neglected at electronic concerts.
The duo began its show with a trio of tracks from Further, its most recent and rightfully acclaimed album. Notable for its absence of guest vocalists (a departure for The Chemical Brothers), the songs, especially the shimmering, Shinichi Osawa-esque “Dissolve” saw the two men build majestic crescendos of guitars amid their usual, house-bumping beats. The crowd appeared both entranced and enlivened.
Once Rowlands and Simons plunged into “Horse Power,” the most obvious banger on the new disc, the dance marathon that many had hoped for truly began. The two seemed to recognize this and prolonged the track with one raging rebuild after another — pushing the crowd, the lightshow, which depicted everything from parades of elephants to dancing apes made of crystal — and the subwoofers to their limits before reclining back into the more meditative classic “Star Guitar.”
This alternation between dance floor destroyers and softer tracks gave the show a cinematic feel, as Rowlands and Simons slowly wrapped their fingers around the pulse of the crowd. Known hits such as “Hey Girl Hey Boy” and “Believe” left spectators gasping, while “Swoon” and “Escape Velocity” lulled them into a non-medicated ecstasy. It is this skill that places The Chemical Brothers alongside legends like Daft Punk and Underworld.
Toward the end of the set, an unsettlingly huge clown face dissolved across the band’s screen, proclaiming, “You are all my children now.” Few in the bowl raised their voices in argument.
The last show of KCRW’s World Festival, titled “Viva Mexico!” will take place Sept. 19, and will celebrate the anniversaries of Mexico’s independence and revolution. Featured artists include Ozomatli, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles and Grandeza Mexicana Folk Ballet Company.

I’d like to begin with a disclaimer: I am, perhaps more than anyone I know, a product of my generation. A student of print and digital journalism, I’m in a constant flurry of media production, consumption and skeptical evaluation. Of course, the immediate reaction is — who isn’t?
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you with Millennials. Although I might have a biased view, I believe this demographic has distinguished itself from those preceding it in unimaginable ways.
A paradigm shift has occurred in the mindset of college students in the United States, leaving us to muse about how and why we became the Zuckerberg Youth and the implications of our Web 2.0 lives. Whether or not the conclusion will be that we are doomed to become vegetative slaves to our flat-screen TVs à la Wall-E or if our postmodern outlook will be our saving grace has yet to be determined, though my inclination is that it’s going to be a combination of the two.
USC serves as the perfect backdrop for this type of self-examination, as it’s a university at the forefront of technology, whether in Annenberg School for Journalism & Communication, the School of Cinematic Arts, Viterbi School of Engineering or simply in the bookbags of students traipsing down Trousdale Parkway. Textbooks are morphing into eReaders. My classmates are starting to read Aristotle off their iPads.
Consider the epicenter, that magnificent altar of blue and white: Facebook. Let’s be honest. I’ve been hitting the refresh button on my newsfeed every 10 minutes as I study; it’s become subconscious. Half of my brain is stumbling through a course reader while the other half guiltily remains fixated on the latest trivial conversation I’ve read between mutual acquaintances.
As freshmen we were introduced to a whole new kind of Facebook fixation, in the form of college groups. In the age of keeping tabs, joining the 2014 group for your college-to-be serves a number of purposes.
On a superficial level, it’s a subtle way of boasting your next stop for those not bold enough to make it status material. But the dynamic of the group itself is what’s most interesting.
Our parents’ generation talks often of those first awkward encounters on move-in day, meeting your roommates, dorm mates and classmates for the first time. They could have been right-wing, fire-throwing, Russian literature majors from Bangladesh with a passion for taxidermy, but that would simply be something you’d have to uncover along the way.
But Generation Y the group, and the requests start pouring in. We got to “know” some of our classmates long before we stepped onto McCarthy Quad. I can’t help but wonder how much of the online footprint reflects the real one? Walking through the dorm hallways, I’ll see a familiar face I know in the context of discussion forum posts on the web. But some of us cross the ogling line when they post their major, residence hall and a brief synopsis of their life story online — and I remember it?
Having predisposed ideas about my peers coming into school was both a blessing and a curse. It made me feel more confident about the environment I was stepping into. I knew some names, some faces, who was friendly and who was, well, too friendly.
But there’s also something to be said for discovering a person in the context of a completely fresh handshake and a few unassuming questions.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not being overly optimistic — even in scenarios like those, I’m likely to return to my dorm and scope out my new friends’ profiles to see if I read them right. When I go to check Facebook and see Grizzly Bear listed under the favorite music of someone I judged a bonafide hipster boosts my ego just the tiniest bit.
Part of me wishes that we could strip the Facebook identities away entirely and get to know each other from genuine face time. Too bad we’ll be too busy stalking the girl down the hall.

It’s funny how we rely more on these site to meet one another when we could just wait for the first time we actually meet the people in person. I admit, I’ve added people before I met them online and I’ve added people even after I just met them in person for the first time, but we should still try to embrace the feeling of meeting someone new completely by just meeting them in person.

The Los Angeles Times recently rattled the Los Angeles Unified School district with the release of an article analyzing the abilities of individual teachers to improve their students’ performance on standardized tests. What’s being referred to as the “value-added analysis” approach has created controversy over how administrators can evaluate teachers and to what extent this information will affect the education system, hiring policies and professional reputations.
Rita Yeung| Daily Trojan
The move has garnered both prominent criticism and support, from the L.A. teachers union President A.J. Duffy calling a massive boycott of the Times to the official endorsement by the Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.
Although the harsh reality of gauging teachers’ abilities from test scores has caused many an indignant response from proponents of the public school system, this new form of analysis is ultimately beneficial when it comes to tackling the myriad problems of the education system. It moves the discussion from the abstract factors of budgets and geography toward the more specific and concrete factors of what happens in individual classrooms.
But offensive as the idea might seem at the outset, we deserve the highest standards of performance from our teachers, and to know whether or not those standards are being met.
Understandably, this kind of statistical analysis can change the educational game significantly, exacerbating the success-at-all-costs mindset perpetrated by No Child Left Behind to improve students’ test scores and increase the blame — and burden — on teachers. However, this break from the  norm could be exactly what the California education system needs in this era of budget crises and educational policy reform. It stirs the will to act in parents, students, teachers and administrators alike.
The implementation of in-depth analyses in teacher evaluation reflects a favorable shift that states parents and students have a right to demand better of their teachers. The ramifications of these analyses reach all levels of education, raising the question of how can we, the students, go about getting better teachers or improving the ones we already have.
The differences between us as university students and those still in grade school are significant. For younger students, it’s the parents and administrators who carry the brunt of the crusade, fighting for quality education on behalf of students who cannot fully articulate what they want from their teachers. But those of us enrolled in college are more likely to face the situation head-on because we pay tens of thousands of dollars for our education.
As students, we have professor evaluation forms to voice our opinions, which do have some effect on whether up-and-coming instructors are offered more classes or will be hired full-time. There is little a student can do, however, to offer criticisms to tenured professors other than hope they look through evaluations for ways to improve their teaching methods.
The system of “value-added analysis” suggested by the Los Angeles Times and being considered for district-wide teacher evaluation would become a new standard for grade school teachers to achieve in order to improve LAUSD’s quality of education. Ultimately, younger students must be prepared to graduate and pursue higher education (should they choose), and this particular analysis of whether teachers equip their students with the skills to take standardized tests is an essential standard all educators should meet.
If we are to demand that our public high school teachers prepare students for standardized tests and other hurdles needed to get into elite universities, what should we demand of the professors teaching at those universities?
For some, college is a place where students can learn for the intrinsic value of learning itself. For others, however, college is the ticket that all of us hope will land us a sustainable and fulfilling job. Just as these “value-added analyses” gauge whether grade school teachers prepare students for higher education, university students should have a system that gauges whether college professors adequately prepare their students for careers and the ever-scary real world.
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, California ranks at a dismal 47th in the nation in public school test scores. This disparity between California’s less-than-stellar public grade school system and world-renowned universities, such as the UC system, is a cause for shame. Students in California high schools are finding it increasingly difficult to get into good colleges, especially in the UC system as budget crises are causing those schools to accept more and more out-of-state students to compensate, raising the competition among in-state students.
An analysis system for public high schools would benefit classrooms by polishing the end-focus of preparing students for more advanced education. This system might be difficult to implement as it would require keeping in contact with numerous alumni and calculating complex factors that would compare job satisfaction and other extenuating components. But the end result for all students is the same: We must demand that our teachers equip us with the skills we need to face the next stage in life.

The Trojans have not tackled in weeks in the hope of preventing injuries. Well, so much for that idea.
Backup center Abe Markowitz hurt his foot Sunday during light workouts and will likely miss four weeks. Markowitz, a redshirt sophomore from Hawaii, was listed as the second center on the depth chart behind senior Kristofer O’Dowd.
Junior Michael Reardon, who is currently listed as a reserve at right guard, could move to the center spot. But Reardon sat out of Sunday’s scrimmage because of hip soreness.
The USC offensive line already lacks depth, so every injury hurts that much more. Multiple linemen have missed practice time because of ailments. Right guard Khaled Holmes sat out time last week because of a neck injury and left tackle Matt Kalil has battled a hamstring strain. Both Holmes and Kalil are still expected to start Thursday night against Hawaii, however.
With Matt Barkley, Allen Bradford and Marc Tyler in the backfield, USC returns lots of experience at quarterback and running back. But that is going to matter little if the offensive line can’t stay healthy.
And once the actual full-contact hits start coming Thursday night, staying healthy might be one of USC’s biggest challenges.

A bedbug infestation that began several years ago has now reached its worst level in years, according to AOL news.
Colleges throughout the nation have reported a resurgence of the nasty nocturnal insects in dorm rooms and common areas.
Those specifically identified in media reports do not include USC. But several high profile institutions, including Stanford and the City University of New York, have begun to grapple with recent infestations.
The new wave of insects has gotten so severe that some have called for a lift on the decades long ban of DDT, the notorious and ultra-effective pesticide that has long been thought to be detrimental to the environment and may cause cancer in humans.
It is unlikely the government will take such dramatic steps just yet, but USC students can help reduce their likelihood of exposure by understanding and working to ward off the creatures.
Bedbugs are small circular insects, about a fifth of an inch, and visible to the naked eye. During the day they hide under pillows, in radiators, under bed sheets and in generally dark, secluded places. At night they’re known to swarm beds, feeding off people while they sleep, and leave red marks and welts on the sleepers body.
USC Housing advises that you inspect your bed periodically, reduce clutter in your room, vacuum the floors and furniture frequently and be generally tidy and hygienic.
If you do discover you have a bedbug problem, contact USC Housing immediately. It will work with pest-control specialists to eradicate the problem quickly and efficiently.

The difference a few weeks make.
At the start of fall camp, redshirt junior running back Mark Tyler was so far down the depth chart at the tailback position that the four-year veteran was almost willing to sit out another season for the opportunity to play at another school arose.
“I’m not going to lie,” Tyler told the Los Angeles Times, “I wanted to leave.”
But Tyler, a back who knows all too well about resiliency and patience — as he was forced to redshirt his freshman year due to a broken leg sustained during an Oaks Christian High School playoff game in 2006, and missed the last ten games of 2009 because of a season-ending toe surgery — decided to listen to some wise advice.
That advice came in the form of his father, former UCLA star and Los Angeles Rams running back Wendell Tyler, who suggested that his son graduate from USC and make the most of his opportunity to play in a prestigious program led by Pat Haden.
Eager to prove that he belonged in the program as a running back and not as a linebacker, which defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin suggested just a few months ago, the former No.2 tailback recruit in the country has shown great growth and consistency since fall camp opened in early August.
The 5-foot 11-inch, 230-pound power back’s efforts have not been lost on USC coach Lane Kiffin, and in unlikely fashion the Lancaster native has made an improbable yet well-deserved leap to the top of the team’s running back rotation.
On Thursday, Tyler is set to make his first collegiate start against Hawaii, a debut that the junior feels more than justifies his decision to stay.
“That’s why I came to USC, to be the starting running back one day,” he said.
For his career, Tyler has amassed 270 yards on 41 rushes while also recording two rushing touchdowns.
