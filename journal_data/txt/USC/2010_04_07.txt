Based on this year’s admissions numbers, earning a spot at USC was harder this year than ever before.
Of the 35,730 applicants, 8,500 were admitted for the fall semester for a total acceptance rate of 23.8 percent, according to Tim Brunold, USC’s director of undergraduate admissions. Last year, 24.1 percent of applicants were admitted.
Based on its acceptance rate, Brunold said USC remains among the 40 most selective universities in the country and among the eight most selective schools in California.
“Getting into USC makes me proud of what I’ve done and everything I’ve accomplished,” said Vivian Yan, an admitted student from Orange County, Calif. “I know you can’t measure success by where someone’s gotten in, but it makes me feel like I’ve done something worthwhile.”
This year’s class is also slightly stronger than last year’s, with an average SAT score more than 20 points higher than last year’s.
“It’s very strong,” Brunold said. “There’s been an enormous increase in quality in both SAT scores and GPA. It’s at the highest it’s ever been.”
The quality of students can be seen not only in their GPAs and SAT scores but also in more qualitative factors, Brunold said.
“They have more rigorous coursework, more activities, [and] higher quality of writing on essays,” he said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say this year’s class is the strongest we’ve ever put together. The overall quality of the pool is what stands out in my mind.”
In addition to the 8,500 fall admits, about 1,000 students have also been admitted for the spring semester and are currently on a waitlist to see if they can start attending USC in the fall. These announcements will be made at the end of May.
Brunold said the school expects to enroll about 300 freshmen in the spring.
“I can’t believe I’m in,” said Allison Selick, a spring admit from New Jersey. “I’ve wanted this for a really long time. Everyone fits into a certain school, and I know USC is a dream school for a lot of people, so I just feel really fortunate.”
There was also an increase in ethnic diversity of admitted students.
About 20 percent of the freshman class identified themselves as African American, Latino, Native American or Pacific Islanders, Brunold said. Last year, this number was closer to 18.9 percent.
This year, USC also admitted more international students; 12 percent of the admitted students for the fall 2010 semester are international students, compared to about 10.5 percent last year.
Some statistics stayed about the same. About 47 percent of admits were male and the remainder were female for both the 2009 and 2010 fall semesters, Brunold said.
Additionally, about 10 percent of the admitted students both years were first-generation college-goers.
Brunold said about 20 percent of the admitted class received some kind of merit-based scholarship, ranging from the full trustee scholarship to scholarships granting a few thousand dollars per year.
Between 60 and 65 percent of the incoming class will receive need-based financial aid.
Overall, Brunold said, admissions was tougher this year than ever before.
“As the overall quality of students increases and admission decreases, we’re going to notice a lot more students are disappointed,” Brunold said.
The 8,500 admitted students have until May 1 to decide whether they will attend.
Improvements in admission standards under Sample have been singularly outstanding.   No school in the country has been hotter.  Now if we could just get the yield rate up.
Penis!
Very impressed with the academic enhancement of USC over the past decade.  Keep it up.
Cal Alumnus-
Thank you for the nice comment about USC. It is a true sign of class when one is able to respect the achievements of another. Schools like Cal and USC make the state of California the best choice for higher education in the country. Cheers to the Golden State!
Master…
Please keep your drivel off this board.  I hope you don’t go to SC, because we pride ourselves on being race blind and you clearly are not.  
I think SC does a great job of balancing affirmative action with admitting quality applicants. 
I agree with the other Sophomore above that the transfer requirements are hilariously lax.  How can we claim to be selective when we let in high school rejects that go to a community college for a semester and get an easy 4.0??
They need to stop admitting minorites with poor grades and stop rejecting whites or even Asians who are superior.. End the discrimination.. However, having said that we wouldn’t like USC to be 60% Asian like certain UC schools.
What are you saying?  It’s not okay to admit underrepresented minorities with lower grades than their white or Asian peers?  But it’s also not okay to admit too many Asians who have higher grades than their white peers?
Who are you?  I have a hard time believing you’re associated with a university that prides itself in the work it does in the surrounding communities.
Now can we work on increasing the selectivity for transfer students?
Good call Sophomore. I think USC should decrease its capacity in general, so to increase selectivity. Too many transfers presume admission to SC after getting rejected by Cal and UCLA. It’s obvious that public schools, with their much cheaper tuition, will get a lot more applicants than private schools, which leads to a more “stringent” admission process. Besides, SC is a private school, and private schools should not confer admissions so easily nor be too generous in financial aid packages; the dismal economy dictates.
I think SC has already proved over and over again under Sample’s leadership, its stance on public service and outreach via JEP and other programs in which students interact with the immediate community. SC does not need to worry about its “private school snob” image, because it’s no longer.
[…] a Minority?  13 04 2010   The answer is a resounding yes. After being pointed out to an article on the Daily Trojan by Sumi Pendakur, the awesome director of the Asian Pacific American Student Services, I decided to […]

Coming back to the school where it all started, the Invisible Children organization will be hosting an event Thursday to raise awareness about the crisis in Uganda and its effect on children.
USC alumni Jason Russell and Bobby Bailey, along with co-founder Laren Poole, began Invisible Children after they visited Africa as students to create a filmmaking project. After seeing the toll the Lord’s Resistance Army — a militant group terrorizing communities in Uganda — took on the children in the country, the two created the documentary Invisible Children: Rough Cut and sparked the movement that is still going strong today.
“We’re promoting people in the international community to be aware of the atrocities that are going on in Eastern Africa and Northern Uganda,” said Garrett Glick, a Southern California representative and roadie for Invisible Children.
Invisible Children sends 10 tours to visit schools around the country every year. USC is a special stop for the organization because of the group’s roots at the university, Glick said.
“It started as a project from USC and just blossomed into a huge movement,” Glick said. “USC is where Invisible Children was planted.”
This year’s event, called the “Legacy Tour,” will focus on discussing and raising money for children who cannot afford to attend school because of poor economic conditions in Uganda. There will be a movie screening, spoken word artists and a forum.
The forum will attempt to put a face on the tragedy by featuring two speakers who have experienced the situation in Uganda firsthand, Glick said.
Devon Feldmeth, president of Invisible Children at USC, said this is the first time the tour has brought such important presenters to USC. Jolly Okot, the director of Invisible Children’s Ugandan business operation, and Okello Ronald, a former child soldier in Uganda, will speak about their experiences during the forum.
“They’re telling the story of their life to inspire people,” Feldmeth said.
Ronald, who just graduated from high school in Uganda, has been a peace advocate since he was 8 years old and now hopes to bring awareness to the United States. As a child, Ronald escaped abductions from the LRA nearly 10 times, Feldmeth said.
Cameron Ernst, last year’s president of Invisible Children at USC, said the screening and events at USC help raise awareness on a campus where not many students know how to get involved in the organization.
“That was kind of our way to inform USC students,” Ernst said. “They’ll see that there’s a lot more to Invisible Children than they thought.”
The “Legacy Tour” will take place in THH 101 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.

Election results have been tallied for the Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood Development Council, and the elected executive board, including a USC student, consists of new faces ready to tackle issues concerning the local community.
Shawn Simons will be returning as president of the neighborhood council but will be working with a new executive board. Ashley Ramos, a junior majoring in political science, will serve as one of the two representatives for Area 3, the area that includes North University Park.
Community · The North Area Neighborhood Development Council, pictured here during a meeting at the University Village in March, recently elected a new executive board. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Ramos will be replacing Samantha Foley, a senior majoring in political science and international relations, and Daniel Wu, a senior majoring in Los Angeles urban studies, both of whom were appointed to the council and served for a year.
Though a number of students showed interest in running for the council, Ramos is the only one who followed through with the election process. Ramos said she decided to run because she thinks serving on the neighborhood council will be a good experience and could be a starting point for her to learn more about city planning and urban development.
In her new position on the council, Ramos said she hopes to be a link between the university and the community.
“As far as what I would like to do on the council is just to keep an open line of communication between the university and residents,” Ramos said. “It would be really good to just have everybody in the neighborhood kind of have a say in the Master Plan since it affects so many people.”
Although Ramos will graduate before her two-year term on the council ends, she said she plans to go to graduate school at USC, which will give her the opportunity to stay on as an active member of the council.
Two of the main issues the executive board plans to address this term include creating a community benefits package that will present concerns about the Master Plan to the university and city hall and ensuring that recreational activities for South Los Angeles children will continue. Parks and libraries, Simons said, have been struggling amid the city’s stark $212 million budget deficit.
Simons said she is currently working on a budget proposal with the mayor’s office to identify strategic partnerships for parks and libraries through neighborhood councils.
“I think this is going to be a huge piece of the puzzle in South L.A. … Those services are so desperately needed for the youth in our area,” she said.
The new executive board will also be working on the council’s outreach efforts, especially because it wants to be accessible for community members who will be affected by budget cuts.
“We need to make sure people know who we are and how they can get in touch with us … When there is a crisis happening, we need to mobilize our area and amplify our voices,” Simons said.
The council, however, will face challenges in reaching these goals.
Simons said the new board is going to have to be very smart about how it allocates money and look for new ways to reel in funds. The Los Angeles City Council has cut $40,000 of NANDC’s funding because of the deficit, she said, and during the next fiscal year, starting in July, the council will be starting at a zero dollar balance.
The two outgoing USC student representatives said they have high hopes for the council after what they were able to achieve during their time.
Foley, who served for a year on the neighborhood development council, said one of her biggest accomplishments while on the council was lobbying to move the local farmers market from Shrine Place to University Avenue.
“That’s been awesome because students go up and down that street all the time, and it’s an area [where] community members also feel like participating. It’s accessible to both groups,” she said.
Foley and Wu also worked to launch public forums aimed at gathering opinions about the university’s Master Plan. Those forums began last month and will continue in the coming weeks.
Wu said serving on the council was a great experience and gave him the chance to work with community members and also to observe interactions between members.
The new executive board will host its first steering committee this month to help identify some basic principles as well as approve appointed positions.
There is some incorrect information in this article. It says that only Ashley was the only USC student who followed up on the election process for the NANDC. However, there were two USC graduate student that also ran for the represenative positon for Area #3. Juanita Price, a first year student at the School of Education and Aliya Yousufi (that would be me!), a second year student at the law school. I even had a candidate statement that clearly stated that I was a USC student wanting to be a representative for the USC community on the council. Despite not having been elected, I think the graduate student community should aslo be credited for taking an interest regarding this election!

Highlighting a week of events focused on global health, USC will host a health career fair Thursday to help students realize that there are opportunities in global health beyond traditional careers.
The career fair is being held as part of Global Health Awareness Week, a joint venture between USC and UCLA that was first held last year. This year’s theme is “Urbanization and Health,” and the event has featured a number of speakers and workshops.
At the career fair, which will be on Trousdale Parkway from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., representatives from organizations including the Red Cross, Doctors for Global Health and TOMS Shoes will be present to discuss jobs and volunteer opportunities with students.
Ivette Flores, program manager of the USC Institute for Global Health, said she hopes that this week’s events will remind students about the interconnected nature of the world and the impact they can have on it.
“Los Angeles itself is a global village,” Flores said. “Even if you never leave your backyard and you live in L.A., you are experiencing global health issues because of the diversity of the population: health outcomes, mortality issues … Global health transcends all boundaries and affects everyone.”
USC student coordinators Kelly Leech and Minh Tran are optimistic about the turnout at the fair because attendance at all of this week’s events has been high.
“Attendance is up — people are talking about global health week online and on the Facebook page, and we’re getting a lot of messages from the website,” Leech said.
Various events have taken place this week at UCLA and USC, on both the Health Sciences Campus and University Park Campus. On Monday evening, an exhibit by photojournalist Paul Rockower, “Public Health through a Public Diplomacy Lens,” was unveiled in the Von KleinSmid Center courtyard, and a discussion was held featuring experts Neal Baer and Sandra de Castro Buffington, who discussed the role of entertainment in public health education.
Attendees found the presentations interesting and impactful.
“I thought the presentation was very nice,” Elizabeth Connely, a staff member at the Levan Institute, said. “I don’t think I’m going to become a doctor, but I hope that in some way I can get involved.”
The overall goal of the week, Flores said, is to raise awareness about the impact of increased urbanization on public health around the world and to help bring students interested in public health together.
“We’ve noticed that everyone on campus is doing global health work in one way or another, and we want to make it easy for students to find those kinds of things,” Flores said.
Last year’s inaugural series, “Global Health Awareness Week: Forming Partnerships, Breaking Barriers,” was initiated by a collaboration between two friends: a medical student at UCLA and a public health student at USC.
“They were students interested in breaking down the barriers between USC and UCLA ­— the intention of which was to work together to where we had global health activity going on across Los Angeles,” Flores said.
The global health collaboration between USC and UCLA does not end this week; students from both campuses and their affiliated organizations will be joining forces again April 18 to host Soccer in the Streets, a soccer game and health fair in Huntington Park to promote health and fitness.
UCLA public health student Tina Batteate looks forward to other collaborations in the future.
“I think it’s been a wonderful experience — I think we balance each other. We [each] have different faculty members working in different areas, and we complement each other’s faculty,” she said. “We have the Art and Global Health Center, they have [the Institute for Global Health] — we have different institutes on each campus as well, and it’s really great to bring them all together.”

As the NFL draft approaches, pundits and analysts are spending a large amount of time predicting which prospects will go where and when.
ESPN’s NFL Draft experts Todd McShay and Mel Kiper, Jr. released their most recent mock draft Wednesday, and both included two USC prospects in the first round.
McShay projected tackle Charles Brown to become a Green Bay Packer with the 23rd pick in the draft, and had safety Taylor Mays joining the Dallas Cowboys with the 27th pick. Kiper, on the other hand, had Brown going 27th to the Cowboys and Mays going 30th to the Minnesota Vikings.
Brown and Mays have both seem drastic changes in their draft projections throughout the last season. Brown was named a first team All-American by multiple sources this season, and has seen his stock rise significantly.
Mays, on the other hand, was projected as the top safety in the draft last season, and a possible top five pick. During his senior season, Mays was routinely criticized for his coverage ability and saw his draft stock plummet. An outstanding combine, highlighted by a controversial 40-yard dash timed anywhere from 4.24 to 4.43, helped him regain momentum heading into the draft.
Mays, Brown and the other nine Trojans entering the draft hope to continue the recent USC tradition of getting drafted in the first round. Three Trojans were taken in the fist round of 2009, four in 2008 and two in 2006.

To the home cook, making good pizza is a tad intimidating. The pros use massive ovens made of hundreds of pounds of bricks, which hold a lot of heat and reach upwards of 900 F. Your oven has two wire metal racks and starts to smoke when it hits 500 F. Clearly, this is not a fair fight.
There have, historically, been a couple home solutions.
One is to invest in a pizza stone — a heavy stone disc that will run you about $30. Now in my experience the stones take an hour to heat up and don’t produce particularly impressive results.
For the more adventurous, there exists some Internet how-tos on rigging your oven so it can be opened during the cleaning cycle (where temperatures can hit 900 F range). The prospect of that scares me a bit though, as I prefer to keep my relationship with the fire department distant.
Faced with these options, I had resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn’t be making respectable pizza in my apartment. That was until the Internet suggested I try my cast-iron skillet.
When my apartment catches on fire, and I’m scrambling to grab my possessions, my cast-iron will probably be the first on my list. It is easily the most versatile and useful tool in the kitchen. If you care about cooking, want to get started or love someone who loves to cook, get them a cast-iron — and then make pizza.
To start, make or buy some dough. I usually make it, because it’s really just throwing some flour, yeast, water and oil in a bowl, but store bought works. You should also be able to go to any place that makes pizza and ask them for some dough (if they won’t sell you any, don’t eat there — they must be hiding something). Put the cast-iron on the stove, turn the heat on high until the pan starts to smoke a little bit, and pour some olive oil in. Stretch the dough out fairly thin, so it’s the size of the pan, and throw it in.
After about a minute or so, take some tongs and flip it; the cooked side should be spotted and brown (think Indian naan). Now top your pizza: sauce, shredded cheese and whatever else you desire. Lower the heat a bit, put a lid or a sheet of foil over the pan, and remove after fiveish minutes. Cut. Enjoy.
I can’t say it’s the best pizza I’ve ever eaten (that would be Berkeley’s Cheeseboard, hands down), although it is way better than the $15 I shelled out at Mario Batali’s famed Mozza. If nothing, it’s an easy party food, a good way to impress a date and the closet I’ll ever get to professional pizza in my apartment.

USC sophomore infielder Ricky Oropesa hit a two-out solo home run in the bottom of the eighth inning to give USC a 4-3 victory against CSU Bakersfield Wednesday night at Dedeaux Field.
Weekday warriors · Junior infielder Joe De Pinto and the Trojans continued to play well during midweek games, beating California State Bakersfield 4-3 at home. The Trojans have won six of seven weekday games. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Oropesa had three hits on the day, but his final shot cleared the right field wall and gave USC back a lead the bullpen had vanquished in the top half of the frame.
Making his first start of the season for USC (15-14, 2-4), junior pitcher Logan Odom lasted only two-plus innings and gave up two runs handing the game over to the bullpen in the third inning.
Sophomore Brad Douthit, junior Ryan Cabral, senior Shuhei Fujiya, junior Chris Mezger and sophomore Chad Smith combined for seven innings of solid relief, allowing only one run on 14 strikeouts and six hits. Smith earned the win after escaping an eighth-inning jam.
Bakersfield (12-15) starter Mike McCarthy took the complete-game loss, going eight innings allowing four runs, seven hits and striking out seven.
The Roadrunners jumped on the board first in the top of the second inning. Catcher Jeremy Rodriguez led off the frame with a single up the middle, and after advancing to second on infielder Jason Kudlock’s single, outfielder Kevin Younger, who had four hits on the day, drove Rodriguez home on a two-out double to left field.
Trailing 1-0, the Trojans answered back quickly in the bottom of the inning. After a leadoff walk to sophomore outfielder Alex Sherrod, senior infielder Keith Castillo homered to left center, giving USC its first lead of the ballgame. Junior infielder Matt Hart followed Castillo’s drive with a double to left center, and then sophomore catcher Kevin Roundtree sent him home with a single through the right side to give USC a 3-1 lead.
Odom was knocked out in the top of the third inning after walking leadoff batter Joey Mills. The speedy outfielder stole second base and then came around to score on infielder Brandon Boren’s RBI single up the middle, cutting the Roadrunner’s deficit to one.
Douthit replaced Odom, but, after getting one out, he gave up two consecutive walks to load the bases. USC coach Chad Kreuter then turned to Cabral, who ended the Roadrunner’s rally by striking out both Kudlock and third baseman Garrett Branske to end the inning. Cabral struck out seven batters in two and two-thirds innings of no-run relief.
USC’s bullpen held the Roadrunners scoreless until the top of the eighth. Younger led off the inning with a base hit through the right side off Mezger. With two outs, Boren doubled to left center and tied the game.
Smith relieved Mezger and allowed a walk before getting out of the inning. Following Oropesa’s solo shot in the bottom of the eighth, Smith ran into trouble in the ninth, but he struck out the side to notch the win for the Trojans.
USC takes on California this weekend at Dedeaux Field in the final three games of its seven-game homestand. The Pac-10 action begins Friday at 6:30 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

The Liason Committee on Medical Education has granted USC’s Keck School of Medicine the maximum eight-year accreditation, based on a “full survey visit” conducted by a committee survey team in November 2009.
According to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, accreditation is offered to all medical schools that ensure “that medical education takes place in a sufficiently rich environment to foster broad academic purposes.”
Carmen A. Puliafito, dean of Keck, was pleased that Keck achieved full accreditation.
“The full accreditation and praise received from this important committee that sets national standards for medical schools is a testament to the quality of our medical education program and our dedicated faculty,” Puliafito said in a release.
In a letter to President Steven B. Sample announcing the accreditation, the committee said that by adopting a program using non-physician medical student educators as faculty members associated with each core clerkship, the school provides “consistent, responsive and effective clinical student education across all sites.”
The Division of Medical Education, the letter stated, is “an impressive institutional resource, providing effective faculty development.”
Further, the letter addressed the Office of Faculty Affairs and its “pervasive impact on faculty enthusiasm, career advancement and productivity in education, research and clinical care.”

If you thought your bracket looked bad this year, just wait until next year.
Yes, it will be hard to beat the chaos of only one No. 1 seed making the Final Four and having a school that most people couldn’t locate on a map almost win the entire tournament. But if the tournament expands from 65 teams to 96, as is expected, prepare for real March Madness — and not the good kind.
The tournament would become a cluttered mess. Imagine what the new bracket would look like and how difficult it would be to fill out. The teams that would earn byes would be at an heavy immediate advantage, greatly lowering the chance of any upset.
I can only hope that someone is playing the ending of The Planet of the Apes at the NCAA headquarters to express what an awful move this would be. “You maniacs! You blew it up!”
College basketball is plenty watered down as is. With the National Invitational Tournament and the College Basketball Invitational, the postseason feels a lot like “Everyone Gets a Trophy Day.”
So why the need to bring a bunch of also-rans into the Big Dance? Surely no one could have watched the NIT final between Dayton and North Carolina and said, “If only we could see these teams playing in the real tournament.”
Then it must be the same reason behind any NCAA decision: money.
The New York Times said Tuesday that the cost of the broadcast rights to the NCAA tournament will explode from $320 million to $700 million annually for the next three years. Whether CBS retains the rights (the network can opt out of its deal this year) or ESPN jumps on board, the message is clear — the network airing the tournament needs to find a way to bring in a few extra bucks.
So naturally, the solution to all of this is to mess with the product that is so universally loved.
It’s kind of scary to think how much influence the television industry has when it comes to such important decisions. Maybe we’ll see a similar “everyone into the pool” strategy for the NBA playoffs. Because if there’s one thing we haven’t gotten enough of this year, it’s New Jersey Nets games.
In place of the frantic first four days of the tournament we got this year, we’ll all be exposed to NCAA tournament light — now with no carbs or excitement. Teams like Arizona State and Mississippi State will get one last chance to remind us why they have no business being there in the first place.
But worst of all, it will be even harder for teams like Butler to make deep runs in the tournament. Small conference schools will continue to be pitted against one another, and they’ll frequently have to play in the first round before facing a well-rested power.
It doesn’t seem all that bad hypothetically. But would Northern Iowa have beaten Kansas if the 96-team format had been implemented this year and the Jayhawks had been coming off a bye? Many of these upsets will go by the wayside.
Despite all the groaning, the NCAA will win out because sports fans will watch anything. And I mean anything.
Every year, I tune in for the NBA draft lottery — an event in which suited team executives watch ping pong balls determine who gets the first pick in that year’s draft. I would like to say I’m being hyperbolic, but that’s exactly what happens.
It’s arguably the Seinfeld of all sporting events — a show about nothing. But it has consequences, so I need to watch it. When you follow the Washington Wizards, it’s all you have.
So there will be a sizable segment of sports fans who embrace this move by noting that it means more basketball. And even those of us protesting now will watch come next March. I won’t be happy about it, but I’ll tune in.
But only because those ping pong balls don’t start flying around until May.

In much the same way that indie-pop group Tilly and the Wall revolutionized tap shoes, band True Womanhood breathes new life into church organs and industrial blades. The group takes these items and turns them on their heads, creating unusual and different sounds out of items that aren’t part of a classic rock band.
Fem-bot · Basement Membranes, the first release from Washington D.C.-based band True Womanhood, incorporates sounds from household items. - Photo courtesy of Environmental Aesthetics 
Its melancholy, magically dark music is filled with unexpected sounds from unexpected places.
True Womanhood, a three-piece hailing from Washington, D.C., comprises Thomas Redmond, Melissa Beattie and Noam Elsner.
Basement Membranes, the group’s first EP, was released by the band’s Baltimore label Environmental Aesthetics but recorded in a do-it-yourself venue in Brooklyn called Death By Audio.
The band’s sound reflects the same hipster-driven dance sensibilities that are espoused by the underground studio.
“Magic Child” uses the same dark rolling guitars of bands like Interpol or Joy Division but with some added layering of sounds and eerie, often atonal, noises.
“The Monk” is the first single from the release, which was made available this week. The track is notably lighter than many of the band’s other songs and is characterized by a dreamy quality not found anywhere else on the record.
“Dignitas,” on the other hand, is a slow, ominous track that incorporates vastly different sounds into its six-minute playtime. The song even slips into a funk sound in certain parts. In that respect, “Dignitas” offers a lone break from the heavily layered darkness that constitutes the rest of the album.
Immediately after the funk-sounding interlude has run its course, however, the sounds once again become heavy and intricately layered. “A Diviner” uses sunshiny guitars that peek out of the wailing lyrical sounds and rolling drums.
“Shadow People” begins with layered vocals that sound ghostly and are almost a little frightening. When the guitars kick in, they are raw and gloomily war-driven.
Although the sounds of the Basement Membranes are experimental, the album is repetitious and the tracks feel interchangeable.
It makes the entire record seem more like a concept album rather than a conventional album, which is expected to have more variety from one track to another.
The group’s use of household items is impressive and inspiring, and it suggests that other musicians can artistically create a multitude of different sounds from ordinary things. There’s also something very visual about the instruments they use: The band would be interesting to see live since the D.C. rockers consider themselves just as much an art installation as a rock band.
It is the group’s unique approach to music that stir more interest than its music alone. True Womanhood markets exclusively as a music act, however, so it’s likely that they’ll only attract audiences interested in seeing an exciting, exuberant performance.
Just as people love seeing guitars being smashed on stage and lights that color the audience, seeing an organ plugged into a computer and watching how the trio creates out-of-this-universe sounds could be more of a draw than its music, which isn’t necessarily groundbreaking — melodically or stylistically.
On first listen, its songs sound typical to alternative rock dance beats, but it is one to watch for its category–evading methods of creating music.

While relaxing in my dorm Sunday, my roommates and I were surprised when the building suddenly began to sway back and forth.
One of my roommates turned on the T.V. to get news on the earthquake, but it was at least 10 minutes before even local news networks had any coverage of it.
Two of my other roommates immediately went online, and within a minute they not only had a report from the U.S. Geological Survey‘s Earthquake Hazards Program but also information from all across Southern California on the earthquake and any damage it caused.
While news of the earthquake will ultimately fall to the wayside, the differential coverage of the quake across media is a perfect example of the power the Internet has as a news source.
Older media outlets are increasingly demonstrating an inability to keep up in a truly digital age. Simply put, when it comes to the news race, television is falling far behind its online counterpart.
More and more people are being empowered by an Internet connection — whether over an iPhone, a laptop or even a desktop — with the ability to contribute to real-time coverage of news events.
Between blogs, videos and pictures, sources of input that started out as personal opinions have emerged collectively as a viable alternative to the major news networks.
It’s important to note, however, these contributors are not trained journalists. A lot of the content generated from new media sources is unpolished, and it can’t be assumed all online reports are reliable.
But a large portion of the sources are trustworthy, and while they might lack a professional edge, they make up for it with the exclusivity of their eyewitness content, networking skills and access to events official reporters might not have.
Essentially, the people who contribute to new media sources make up a global flash mob, springing into action whenever they are needed.
That’s part of the appeal of new media — it’s citizen journalism, pure and simple. While online news sites exist, it’s regular people who send out links to the articles. In that way, the power is not in the corporation that owns the network, but in the Internet user who decides to share a story with his friends or even create the content himself.
Take a look at old media: The major news networks — CBS, NBC, ABC — are all floundering. MSNBC and Fox News Channel are riddled with partisanship and petty squabbles. CNN, the supposedly moderate station, seems as if it’s actively trying to destroy its own credibility. Between pointless celebrity coverage and awkward attempts to use Twitter and Facebook, Ted Turner’s brainchild is suffering more than the partisan news stations.
These news outlets are doing their best to adapt, going out of their way to implement new resources and technologies, but they fail miserably.
CNN has developed an almost obsessive use of Twitter, trying to control the social networking site with a top-down attempt at the dissemination of information.
CNN’s domineering use of the site completely misses the point of social networks, which create grassroots movements where the people decide what is newsworthy and what to send out to the masses. Television fails to grasp this and misses out on more and more news stories everyday.
If you want a great example of this paradigm shift at work, consider Iran. After the nation’s disputed 2009 elections drove citizens onto the streets in protest all professional journalists were banned from the country. Old media outlets were left with no way to cover the civil strife.
Almost immediately, Iranian citizens began posting videos of police brutality on the Internet and blogs describing life amid the protests. Citizen journalism became the main source reporting from Iran and provided a valuable “man on the street” perspective.
Similarly, after Haiti was struck by an earthquake footage of the quake was already being uploaded onto the web while television networks were rushing to get camera crews to the country. Even when the networks set up their own coverage, however, much of their reports were based off of web videos and pictures put online.
None of this is to say old media ought to give up and quit — television news still provides an invaluable service. News stations have the funds and resources to conduct large-scale investigations and enough clout to interview figures like heads of states.
Sometimes, television really capitalizes on this, like on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS, which has steadily put out great interviews with key policy makers in the international world.
Clearly, old media sources are still able to accomplish quite a bit, but they lack the globalized networking resources that make new media news so powerful.
Old media isn’t dead, but it certainly is not the leader in news the way it used to be. New media has stepped up and taken over. It has empowered us as citizens to contribute to the spread of information, putting the power in our hands. The next time a major event strikes Los Angeles, people won’t be looking to their televisions for the answers. Care to guess where they will turn?

For those of you who want a break from the fashion-obsessed, relationship-crazy lives on Gossip Girl (or for those who aren’t really feeling the detective mysteries anymore), then you should tune in to NBC’s Parenthood.
The new television show, which airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m., is loosely based on Ron Howard’s 1989 film of the same title. With it, both Howard and Friday Night Lights executive producer Jason Katims have introduced a unique twist to prime time television.
Parenthood defies the typical repetitive sitcoms that most people find themselves guilty of watching. But there will be no regrets for Parenthood viewers. With its humorous script and impressive cast, the show lightens the mood for those awkward and quirky moments between parent and child. Being a dramady, Parenthood is one of the most touching, sweet and at times sad shows that has been on the air in a long time.
The series, like the movie, revolves around the lives of four siblings and their individual families. Dealing with being a single parent, balancing work and family life and maintaining healthy relationships are some of the storylines that compose this show.
Not to mention Parenthood sports a great cast. Gilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham plays a drastically different mother figure, one who doesn’t quite know how to deal with her rebellious children. Peter Krause from Six Feet Under plays a very caring husband, brother and father who must deal with his son’s Asperger’s syndrome. Dax Shepard, one of the siblings who lacks responsibility, Krause’s worrisome wife played by Monica Potter and the father of the four siblings, Craig T. Nelson, also largely contribute to the show’s quality.
You will be taken in by the comfortable chemistry between the cast, as well as the relatable story lines. Discover for yourself how great Parenthood truly is.

USC didn’t earn the nickname “Tailback U” without a little help.
All-American and NFL linebackers from Junior Seau to Lofa Tatupu have pummeled, pestered and pushed Trojan ball carriers to greatness through countless bone-wrenching practices and scrimmages. But so far this spring, it has become clear that running backs Allen Bradford and C.J. Gable are going to need a little more help from the other side of the ball.
“We’ve got nine linebackers on our roster,” USC assistant coach Joe Barry said. “And we have three returning starters.”
However, none of the returning players has more than a year of significant game experience for Barry to hang his hat on. Redshirt junior Chris Galippo, sophomore Devron Kennard, senior Malcolm Smith, senior Michael Morgan and redshirt junior Shane Horton all shared time last season on a defense whose leading tackler was the safety, Taylor Mays.
Worse yet, junior-college transfer Glen Stanley, one of the most seasoned of the group, won’t arrive until the fall. Redshirt junior Jordan Campbell, who recorded eight tackles against Washington State last year before spraining his ankle, has been suspended from practice for missing classes and/or tutoring sessions.
Fortunately for the Trojans, Pac-10 offenses are going to have to fight through some immense obstacles to expose any lack of depth in the second level.  Returning defensive tackles senior Christian Tupou and junior Jurrell Casey, and returning defensive ends redshirt sophomore Nick Perry and junior Armond Armstead, average nearly 300 pounds as a unit.
And they’re fast, too.
USC coach Lane Kiffin and defensive line coach Ed Orgeron can’t get enough of Armstead, who weighs 295 pounds but is quick enough to play on the exterior.
“You don’t see guys 300 pounds playing that position,” Orgeron marveled.

Spring is blooming in Los Angeles, but along with blue skies and warm evenings comes a spell of violent guitars, raw percussion and sinister choruses.
Full of it · Though several of the band members met while attending school in Los Angeles, Liars has lived and recorded albums in New York and Berlin, each one reflecting the sonic diversity of the area. - Photo courtesy of Mute Records 
Celebrating the release of its latest album Sisterworld, the now Los Angeles-based experimental rockers, Liars, are playing the El Rey Theatre this weekend, the first show on their North American tour.
“I enjoy touring because it allows us to catch up on current music and see new places,” guitarist Aaron Hemphill said, speaking from his home in Venice, Calif., just before band rehearsal. “When we’re recording and writing an album, we’re in our own little world.”
Recorded and mixed in Los Angeles — where Hemphill met bandmate Angus Andrew while attending the California Institute of the Arts — Sisterworld screeches with the echoes of unnerving, angry instruments, bringing to mind the compositions of Nick Cave and Tom Waits as well as the disparity and sprawl of the city itself.
But Sisterworld is not the first time a Liars record has echoed its place of conception.
The band’s critically acclaimed 2006 album Drum’s Not Dead was produced in Germany, while its considerably more polarizing witch folklore record, They Were Wrong, So We Drowned, was created in a remote cabin in woods of New Jersey.
While amusing in their diversity, Hemphill insisted that such locations are chosen, first and foremost, by how well they facilitate work. 
“We didn’t just decide to make a witch record in the woods and look for a house,” Hemphill said of They Were Wrong, So We Drowned. “Angus wanted to move out of New York and our hope was not only that it would provide a change of scenery but also enable us to work a lot later. Once we fall upon the unifying theme for a record, very naturally our perception of our surroundings focuses on elements that support that.”
While the intensely layered sounds of Sisterworld suggest reliance on expensive effect rigs, Hemphill insisted that his approach to creating original textures was far more organic in nature.
“I really like to change the type of guitar I’m playing or the gauge of the string,” he said. “Hopefully that affects my approach to playing more than a pedal board. It’s more about, ‘What can I try to replicate?’ than, ‘Can I make my guitar sound like a violin?’”
This ethos carries over to concerts and the unpredictable reception of Liars material during the band’s intense live shows (the band is known for its elaborate vocal arrangements and improvisational playing style) is always a thrilling experience.
“We’ve had weird crowd reactions, but usually they’ve been creative gestures,” Hemphill said. “One time in Baltimore, we had a frozen turkey thrown at us on stage. The fact that someone smuggled a frozen bird into the venue during the height of winter, that’s pretty amazing.”
The band made a memorable daytime appearance at the 2009 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and drew a sizeable crowd to the outdoor theater stage despite blistering temperatures. Still, the band’s return to more intimate venues like the El Rey is a spotlight of the upcoming tour.
“We generally prefer indoor [concerts] just because it sounds a bit better and we have more control over the mood,” Hemphill said.
“We’ve been told that we’re not really a daytime band.”
For Hemphill and his bandmates, life on the road offers not only the opportunity to be pelted with poultry but also a chance to see just how far their challenging-yet-unique music has reached.
“I like playing the middle of America a lot,” Hemphill said. “With the Internet these days, there’s not really solid ‘rock towns’ and ‘non-rock towns.’ Lots of surprises.”
While the band’s Internet presence has helped spread Liars’ music, Hemphill — like many other independent musicians — is still unsure about the variable effects of fans’ file sharing.
“It’s definitely not a black and white issue,” Hemphill, who once worked in a record store, said.
“If you’re going to download music for free, hopefully you’ll have the conscience of mind to support the band in other ways. The whole thing might get more people to our shows.”

ESPN’s investigative program, Outside the Lines, recently profiled Athletic Director Mike Garrett, who has overseen a tumultuous past few months in USC’s athletic department.
The report delved into Garrett’s history with the university, which goes as far back as his time at running back for USC, during which Garrett was honored as the 1965 Heisman Trophy winner.
Reserved · USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, pictured here at Lane Kiffin’s introduction, has developed a reputation as a quiet administrator. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
A running back with a small 5-foot-9 stature, Garrett led the nation in 1965 with 267 carries and 1,440 rushing yards and was eventually drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs.
After his time in the NFL, Garrett earned his law degree and was hired as USC’s athletic director in 1993.
That is where the profile picks up, documenting the department’s ups and downs in Garrett’s ongoing stint as athletics director.
During his time at the university, Garrett has seen the basketball team get as far as the Elite Eight in the NCAA tournament and, under the leadership of Pete Carroll, the football team claim two national championships.
Garrett’s choice of Carroll in 2001 brought the department under fire, especially after Carroll’s less-than-stellar record in the NFL. But Garrett’s choice was vindicated by Carroll’s success during his nine-year stay at USC.
Garrett’s accomplishment in the funding and building of the Galen Center, which opened in 2006, was also noted.
Recently, the department has been scrutinized again for controversy surrounding the recruitments of football player Reggie Bush and basketball player O.J. Mayo. An Outside the Lines report in May 2008 revealed some controversy surrounding the relationship between Mayo, the university and Mayo confidant Rodney Guillory.
The profile of Garrett returned to questions surrounding the Mayo recruitment and interviewed a variety of USC officials and sports figures, although Garrett declined to be interview for the show.
Former USC men’s basketball coach Henry Bibby, whom Garrett fired abruptly only four games into his ninth season in 2004, was interviewed by the program and featured extensively.
Bibby described Garrett as “guarded” even as USC will soon hear the outcome of NCAA hearings held in February regarding the Bush and Mayo situations.
Former USC forward Keith Wilkinson also spoke with ESPN, telling OTL that Garrett visited with the team after an overtime loss to Memphis and harshly addressed a visibly shaken.
According to many of those interviewed, Garrett had a hands-on approach to the university’s major sports, attending practices and visiting locker rooms on a regular basis.
Former USC fullback Brandon Hancock — in talking with recently graduated members of the USC football team — revealed Garrett has recently shied away from direct contact with the teams.
Garrett’s relationship with former USC basketball coach Tim Floyd was also investigated, though Floyd also reportedly declined an interview request from the program.
The circumstances surrounding Floyd’s resignation from his post as USC’s men’s basketball coach also raised suspicion in the department. It was later revealed the relationship between Garrett and Floyd was strained during the time directly before the coach’s resignation.

It’s April, which means students have internships on their minds. Around this time of the year, students are beginning to finalize summer plans to work at companies that will help them build professional skills.
Because I’m looking for my first internship, I’ve spent a lot of time researching the different resources USC offers to make students more attractive internship applicants.
The USC Career Planning & Placement Center allows students to make appointments or walk in to get more information about specific internships or to engage in an ongoing discussion about career paths. The center also encourages students to come in for a mock interview session as well as to seek help from career advisers to make sure their résumés are up to code.
The Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business also have their own career centers that help students find jobs and internships in their respective fields. As they are more familiar with the companies at which their students intern, they can give more specific advice about jobs for which their students are applying.
To some extent, such resources seem to be paying off. According to employers, USC students showcase an exceptional set of skills as interns.
Rebecca Slivka, the director of marketing and leasing at STUHO Student Housing, has hired many USC students as interns.
“What we like is that [the interns] are entrepreneurial. They don’t need to be told what to do all the time,” she said. “They are self-motivated, independent students. I really have no complaints.”
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Additionally, USC career advisers have also heard positive feedback from employers about USC interns overall.
“Upon arriving in the workplace, what we hear as kind of a hallmark of a USC student is their leadership potential,” said Kristen Todd, the director of Viterbi Career Resources. “[We hear] that our students tend to be well-rounded and have taken opportunity in leadership here in the school of Viterbi or within the USC community at large, and that translates well in the workplace.”
Clearly, our time as Trojans will prepare us for the work employers expect of us as interns.
But while there is an abundance of resources available, do they actually make a difference when it comes time to interview for the actual positions?
We often focus too much on which internship positions will be the most beneficial to furthering our future careers than the actual process for getting our foot in the door to these internships.
Although available resources can help to make us attractive candidates, we need to remember not to be so engrossed in ourselves that we lose sight of the fact that we’re trying to impress a prospective employer.
“During the interview, students should show enthusiasm for working with my company, how much they know about my company and their willingness and motivation to work,” said Slivka. “It really shows if they’re motivated or look for any internship opportunities.”
Another internship recruiter confirmed that knowledge about the company you’re applying to is incredibly crucial.
“Know your Focus Features films,” said Kirstin Carag, assistant in the national publicity department at Focus Features. “One would be surprised to know how many applicants we get who say they’d love to work at Focus because they love the projects we’ve put out but can’t name a single film.”
In reality, the career centers can only help students so much.
It’s crucial for students to do their homework about their potential employers as well.
So good luck this month finding internships ­­— use USC as a resource, but don’t expect to be able to land that coveted position without taking the initiative to do your own research.

What does ‘radical’ really mean?
I was amused to read that the USC College Republicans’ “teach-in” was entitled “…to Oppose Obama’s Radical Transformation of America.” It seems like USC’s Republicans have a very different idea of “radical” from most of us. President Barack Obama’s health insurance reforms were partially inspired by the policy advocates who inspired Gov. Mitt Romney’s own plan in Massachusetts.
Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who advised both Obama and Romney on health insurance programs, told the Boston Globe that Romney’s health care reform effort as governor paved the way for national reform.
“[Romney] is in many ways the intellectual father of national health reform,” he said.
Obama’s plan also bears a more than passing resemblance to President Richard Nixon’s reform plan. Add in the fact that Obama took many ideas from a bipartisan Brookings Institution paper on “Bending the Curve” as well as incorporating many GOP ideas from within Congress (even if they didn’t vote for it), and you have to wonder if the term “radical” has lost all meaning.
Notwithstanding the demagoguery of Obama’s desperately needed reform of a broken health insurance system, it seems that Republicans are as “radical” as ever when it comes to their own policy ideas.
When will they realize that cutting taxes only makes deficits worse? And when will they say which entitlements — the bulk of federal spending — they would do away with to balance the budget? Social Security? Medicare?
Americans must either pay for the highways, education, health care and research needed to keep up with a rising China or risk running huge deficits indefinitely. It’s not surprising that Obama has had to spend when the private sector refuses to, but it is also no surprise that the only two presidents to have run surpluses since the World War II have been Democrats.
Unfunded tax cuts to the richest, opposing reforming a broken health insurance system, a mess of a foreign policy and bought and paid for by Wall Street; it wouldn’t be so bad if they were not the ones calling others “radical.”

Nothing out of the ordinary about search process
Laura Cueva’s article “Controversy Growing at USC Hospital” casts the efforts of USC University Hospital administrators to collaborate with hospital employees in a very peculiar and pejorative light.
Hiring a consulting firm to try and determine whether it is possible and how to make work conditions sufficiently attractive to employees so that the employees might voluntarily choose to forego a union is not union-busting. It is called providing people with a good place to work. Asking employees about the quality of their work experience with an eye toward a good work environment is just responsible management.
It is nothing nefarious.

Excellent points, Joe.
Oh man! You guys are hilarious. We need to stop the spending spree!!! But not stop spending a trillion plus dollars on two wars that have killed untold numbers of peoples and don’t seem to be going away!!!
Some people think winning wars is an important job of the federal government, even more important than funneling trillions of dollars from the middle class into slush funds to buy votes and pay off Democrat party allies. That’s a philosophy that’s out there. I’m just saying.
Indeed, I think the College Republicans could have named their event better. First of all, it is a negative name, sure to turn off liberals and independents who might have been receptive to hearing a presentation about the GOP message. Second, the term “radical” is not really appropriate for a leftist ideologue who simply wants to repeat the same stupid ideas put forth by every tyrant and dictator from Napoleon to Mussolini to Castro. There’s nothing new and different about Obama’s naked socialism, crass identity politics, and culture of corruption.
The most radical ideas ever conceived by man are the ones that the American revolutionaries fought and died for: that free men and women with faith in God and the right to do as they pleased with the fruits of their labor would  produce more prosperity, peace, and voluntary generosity than any empire or dictatorship ever could. These principles were counter-intuitive: that truth wins when fools are allowed the freedom of speech; that the poor become richer when they don’t rob from their rich neighbors; that self-interested citizens would willingly volunteer to fight for liberty without a draft. The title of the presentation could have just as well been: “Why America’s principles are still the most radical political philosophy on earth… and why Republicans fight for them!”
Simon Radford’s letter repeats the same tired dogma regarding what’s wrong with America, reflecting an ignorance of the broad sweep of history. Wall Street corruption is indisputably tied with the Democratic Party, in point of fact; it is sheer intellectual laziness to put that at the GOP’s feet. That is but one example of the kneejerk anti-GOP sentiment here. Although Simon makes a very few legit points (Obamacare vs Romneycare might be something to debate), the whole argument about which presidents ran surpluses is terribly misleading as it is Congress who SPENDS THE MONEY. And that is where Simon is most disingenuous, because he trots out the old “when are Republicans going to come up with a plan” mantra. Hey dude maybe you should check out Fox News, since they are apparently the only ones reporting on a plethora of Republican plans, including the excellent Ryan Roadmap which is a very very tough but much-needed answer to the question of how are we going to stop this insane spending spree the Democrats are enjoying (while too many GOP have looked the other way). Finally, USC’s College Republicans are not at all far off in calling Obama “radical.” He has radical friends, he espouses radical causes, and he himself wants to radically transform the country. That’s the definition of radical, and they were absolutely correct to characterize him as such. Your letter makes no dent in that argument whatsoever.

The refrain “Hey. I pay $55,000 a year” has become a common joke among students at USC. We use it to justify, say, cramming seven extra pieces of fruit into our bags at EVK. For $55,000 a year, we should be able to hoard all the green bananas we please.
With similarly steep prices for on-campus housing, we should also be able to live in air-conditioned rooms.
Deb Berman | Daily Trojan
While those living in the buildings Fluor Tower, Arts & Humanities and International Residential College at Parkside, Honors House, Seaver Residence Hall and, of course, Radisson Hotel have the blessing of central air conditioning, not all residents are so lucky.
All rooms in New/North residential colleges, Birnkrant, Trojan Hall, Pardee Tower, and the Marks buildings are AC-free. Trojan Hall doesn’t even have it in the lobby, making it the only residence hall completely at the mercy of the weather and whatever evaporative-cooler-type devices students can hide from the housing inspections.
Though it might seem trivial enough in winter, we in the dorms tend to be less forgiving of the situation when we’re sweating in front of our $19.99 Target fans come April and May — and, subsequently, most of the fall term.
Students living in eight of the off-campus apartment buildings are also without air conditioning, to say nothing of what the summer term residents endure; students don’t stay in the dorms over the summer, but only nine out of the 15 summer housing university apartment buildings are equipped with AC. Though, if it helps, a few of them have pools.
Still, there are some valid arguments for why the buildings are set up this way.
The Parkside Apartments were renovated only a few years ago, a perfect opportunity to introduce state-of-the-art AC. Dormitories such as those in northeast corner of campus are older, with antiquated air ducts and limited space; without the convenience of a ground-razing renovation process already on the table, tearing in to the dusty bowels of buildings like Trojan  Hall just isn’t worth the hassle. As it is, the only improvements scheduled for Trojan Hall any time soon are superficial ones for the bathrooms (thank goodness) and the locks on the doors.
To be fair, the disheartening lack of AC isn’t an issue limited to USC. College dorms across the country soldier on without it, prompting desperate students to resort to their own ingenuity. Lifehacker.com showcases a $30 homemade air conditioner, drawn up by “poor college students enduring summer school in an AC-less dorm.” Surely, we can do better than that.
Despite the sneers of UCLA-goers, USC does not, in fact, have a blank check to make whatever improvements strike its fancy. And with so much going on in the agenda of collegiate administration today, it’s understandable that dorm comfort can’t always be a top priority.
But there are certainly steps we could take to ensure that unsuspecting freshman don’t pass out at their desks while resolutely studying for September exams.
Wall-mounted, ductless air conditioners are quiet, space-efficient and — here’s the kicker ­­­— can be purchased for less than $550 a pop. That means a dorm the size of Trojan Hall could be completely air-conditioned for a little more than $60,000. Or, coincidentally, a little more than a single student’s yearly tuition.
At the very least, we could throw one in the lobby.
Moving down an even cheaper route, small plastic fans, like complimentary hotel shampoo, would be a nice touch that wouldn’t terribly inconvenience management. If we are provided with basics like plastic trash cans and microwaves, it’s not unreasonable or unaffordable (again, Target, $19.99) to also ask for a bit of ventilation.
Every dorm room on campus, and even the apartments, could be outfitted with one without breaking the proverbial bank. Let our housing fees ensure us, if not a new or particularly well-lit room, at least the civility of climate control.
We live in Southern California. To put it mildly, it gets hot. Air conditioning, though technically a luxury, is a reasonable expectation at an institution where the point is to constantly concentrate.
Hopefully, USC can soon set aside some money to make the AC-less dormitories and apartments feel less like summer camp.

Tina Fey vows to bring Sarah Palin personality back to SNL
In case you missed Tina Fey’s infamous Sarah Palin impressions on Saturday Night Live during the 2008 election campaign, she says she’s bringing it all back again – at least once.
Fey told the U.K. paper the Telegraph that she’ll likely have to warm up her version of an Alaskan accent for a Palin reprisal on Saturday Night Live.
“I haven’t been watching her on television lately because I’ve been working on 30 Rock, but I’m doing another Saturday Night Live next month and I’m sure we’ll be trying to write something about her,” Fey said.
All that is needed now is Amy Pohler and her Hillary Clinton impression to relive those 2008 Saturday night memories.
“Gleek Week” kicks off with Oprah, new Apple apps
Monday marked the start of what the FOX marketing team is calling “Gleek Week,” a week-long flurry of Glee-centered activity, promotion and love for their hit show. Perhaps the most watched promotion of the week will be on Wednesday when the queen of daytime television hosts the cast for the entirety of her show. Wednesday’s Oprah will feature the entire cast of Glee for interviews and performances.
In addition to the Oprah gig, “Gleek Week” will include new trailers that will allow fans to connect with their favorite characters via Facebook along with the introduction of a new Glee app for the new iPad and iPhone (Yep, there’s an app for that). “Gleek Week” will also take over your MySpace homepage for the week. Fox.com will allow you to create fake pictures of you and the Glee cast to post to your Facebook and MySpace pages. Also, on Fox.com you will be able to submit videos for the current Glee open casting call.
The campaign leads up to the long-awaited return of the show, which airs Tuesday, April 13 at 9:30 p.m. after American Idol on FOX.
Nicollette Sheridan sues Housewives creator for $20 million
Nicollette Sheridan, who played a divorced real estate agent on ABC’s Desperate Housewives is accused the show’s creator, Marc Cheery, of hitting her on the set. In the lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Sheridan claims producer Marc Cherry hit her in the face on the Wisteria Lane set in September 2008.The suit is against Cheery and a producer alleging assault and wrongful termination.
Allegedly, Sheridan had asked Cherry about a line in the script, and he “took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head,” the suit said. According to E! News, after she stormed off to her trailer he came back to “beg forgiveness.”
When Sheridan reported the incident to ABC, Cherry retaliated by killing off her character, Edie Britt, in the popular series, Sheridan claims in the suit.
ABC Studios said in a statement Tuesday, “While we have yet to see the actual complaint, we investigated similar claims made by Ms. Sheridan last year and found them to be without merit.”
While ABC has asserted that the claims are “without merit,” insiders are beginning to come out of the woodwork with descriptions of Cherry that do not make him sound like that great of a man.
Donald Trump withdraws his support for Jesse James
Donald Trump, who was Jesse James’ boss on The Celebrity Apprentice, gave his full support to James a few weeks ago after hearing about his alleged adultery allegations. Initially, Trump thought that was the right thing to do — until he learned the extent of James’ naughty behavior.
Trump wrote:
“I don’t think he’s a changed man or will be a changed man. I found out how many things he did. I don’t think he can get Sandra back. I would imagine that Sandra has had it with everything that’s happened. He’s actually a nice guy. He’s a tough guy, but he’s a nice guy. I really liked him a lot. He’s actually very shrewd and very sharp. I can’t imagine Sandra can really give him a second chance. Too much went down.”
What a change of heart!

Cynthia Cooper and Dr. Jerry Buss were chosen for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday, joining Cheryl Miller, Sam Barry, and Jack Gardner as the only Trojans ever to be selected for the Hall.
Cooper, a part of the 1983 and 1984 women’s national championship teams at USC, played five years in the WNBA for the Houston Comets. From 1997 to 2000 she was an integral component of the team’s four consecutive WNBA championships.
Jerry Buss, who earned a master’s and doctorate degree at USC and then taught chemistry, went on to buy the Los Angeles Lakers in 1979 and still owns the team today. Under his ownership, the team has won nine NBA championships and vastly improved as a franchise altogether.
Cooper and Buss accompany Karl Malone, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Johnson, Bob Hurley, Gus Johnson, Maciel Pereira and the 1960 and 1992 U.S. Olympic Teams as the 2010 inductees.
The induction ceremony will be held Aug. 13, in Springfield, Mass.
Two more of Sam Barry’s players were inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches — Alex Hannum and Bill Sharman — Bill was also inducted as a player.  Tex Winter learned the Triangle Offense from Sam and applied it with great success to the Bulls and Lakers of the NBA.  (Sam also coached Rod Dedeaux, and asked him to take over the baseball team when he enlisted in the Navy during World War II.)
