Panelists discussed how traditional media and social media drive the 2016 presidential election Tuesday in the third installment of the Road to the White House series, “Media and Politics: Traditional, New Media and Social Media,” Tuesday at the Ground Zero Performance Cafe. 
The event included a panel featuring John Thomas, CEO and president of Thomas Partners Strategies; Bob Shrum, Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at USC Dornsife; Laura Davis, digital news director of the Annenberg Center; and Alison Main, a student producer for Annenberg TV News, discussed how the 2016 presidential election is portrayed in the media. Dan Schnur, the director of USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Jack Walker, associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan, moderated the event. 
The panelists all stressed the importance of traditional media in campaigns, as it is where people still get a majority of their information, despite the large reliance on social media by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
“Traditional media is still critical,” Shrum said. “We are fascinated with social media, but it’s a tool, it’s not a message. You have to have a framework or a message.” 
Thomas expressed his concern for people becoming screen agnostic. People watch television on their phones and computers, requiring politicians to follow their lead. To counter this issue, politicians will use social media to kickstart their broadcast campaigns. Social media is a conversation starter.
Davis brought up how this is shown through Donald Trump’s use of Twitter. He will tweet something controversial early in the morning before an interview so there will be something to talk about in the broadcast. This strategy helped him get to where he is because it reaches the public more than traditional advertising. 
“Three years ago, five to seven percent of our persuasion budget was on online activities,” Thomas said. “Now we are at 15 to 20 percent, and every cycle it seems to inch up by 2-7 percent.”
However, social media isn’t always reliable, Thomas said, adding that though social media is heavily used for advertising a campaign, it is still filled with clutter. The panel mutually agreed that though there is an advantage to the use of social media, it is still filled with false advertising and sensationalized articles. 
Davis said that as the digital news director of the Annenberg Media Center, she understood the dangers of social media and warned of what she called the “filter bubble.” In the “filter bubble,” Davis said, social media allows one to create their own world and reality, and in this world there are fake news sites and propaganda trying to take advantage of individuals’ bubble. Davis said that this can hinder one’s ideas and stances on issues.
“Fake news organizations are growing on Facebook, and this content is getting spread,” Davis said. “I think it’s having an actual effect on democracy, because people are not believing sources like they might have in the past. I think the filter bubble, the algorithms that the social networks use to show you content that they think you want is having a real impact on democracy and possibly on this election.”
Though social media has a large influence on campaigns, Thomas still stressed the need for stories to be told in politics, as nothing can be told without a story. Shrum added that a message must be framed, because social media comes and goes as trends do, but stories will always stay and maintain their importance in politics. 
“Campaigns still need certain basic things,” Shrum said. “They need a message and framing. They need discipline. They need polling and survey research and focus groups. If they don’t have them, or they don’t choose to use them, then this [social media] can become a lethal weapon that you turn on yourself.”

Students, faculty and staff discussed the intersection of the law and global health specifically for transgender populations at “Maximizing Sexual Health & Rights of Transgender Populations: The Changing Role of the International Classification of Diseases” Tuesday in the Musick Law Building. The USC Gould School of Law and Global Health sponsored the event.
Doe Mayer from the USC School of Cinematic Arts moderated while Sofia Gruskin, the Director of the Program on Global Health & Human Rights in the Keck School of Medicine and Gould School of Law, gave the presentation.
The discussion centered around the fate of the International Classification of Diseases, the standard tool in assessing health management. The ICD was last updated in 1990 and is set to be revised in 2018.
The current ICD, according to Gruskin, classifies transgender populations as people with a mental and behavioral disorder. Much of the conversation regarding transgender populations and the ICD is whether they should be included or ejected from the document altogether. 
“Based on lots of discussions among advocacy groups, it’s clear that there is consensus that transgender populations need to be in the new ICD, but it needs to not be in the mental behavioral disorder section,” Gruskin said.
The larger implication of its inclusion is the access to medical care.
“The reason it needs to be included is so people can access hormones and silicone and so any issues they have with healthcare can be recognized by health professionals,” Gruskin said.
The presentation highlighted Argentina’s 2012 progressive gender identity law. The law legally acknowledges the right to self-assigned gender identity. Moreover, it allows a change to gender identity without requirement of psychiatric evaluation and a right to appropriate gender health services. By the end of 2013, over 3,000 individuals had adopted a new gender identification because of the law.
“The people who were most empowered were those to first take advantage of this right,” Gruskin said. “A change of institutional mechanisms had to be in place for people to have such a different experience than what they had before. The law made a positive difference for people’s lives.” 
Similar work is being done in the United States to be presented at the World Health Assembly in 2018. Both Gruskin and Mayer mentioned the importance of including the transgender population in the conversation about ICD definition revision.
The current working definition is “gender incongruence of adolescence and adulthood.” The definition requires transgender individuals to have persistent incongruence between an individual’s experienced gender and the assigned sex. Furthermore, the inconsistency of the word “trans” between different versions of the ICD introduces the possibility of discarding it in the 2018 ICD.
“The word ‘trans’ implies movement, so is that still the right word that should be used for those people who change their gender?” Mayer said. “We’ve seen changes in the language throughout the years, so we see the possibility of changes in the future.”
Gruskin emphasized how the definitions in the ICD are not human rights definitions.
“The definitions are meant to give people access to medical services like hormones and silicone,” Gruskin said. “In 2018, you’ll need two-thirds of countries of the world to agree to this definition for the ICD to change.” 
The USC Law and Global Health Collaboration’s next event will be a conversation on transgender immigrant and refugee populations. It will be on Nov. 8 in Musick Hall 118/120.
I ran across this account in the Daily Trojan only incidentally, but noticed a detail given in this account that bears clarification: the use of silicone for body modification in the transgender community.
Body modification is one of several options available to the transgender community, as it is for cisgender individuals who wish to achieve some aesthetic change in the look of their bodies. Transgender people often choose modify their bodies with additional plastic surgery to supplement the changes brought by hormone therapy, as there are limits to what hormone therapy can do; for transgender women, this often will mean breast implants, which use medical-grade, FDA-approved, silicone.
What is not clear in the account of this presentation is whether medical-grade or industrial-grade silicone is being referred to. This is an opportunity to explain to readers why it is important to distinguish between them.
Industrial-grade silicone is also used, illegally, for use in body contouring and filling. Used primarily by poor and unknowing transgender women, this practice is not sanctioned by medical professionals, is highly dangerous, can result in a lifetime of medical problems, and can even be fatal. I refer readers to news accounts of ‘Injection Parties’ and arrests of predatory individuals who take cash for injecting transgender women in home settings.
In both instances we see an underlying problem: the Transgender community, which continues to be highly stigmatized and marginalized, often cannot get access to appropriate medical care, much less afford it; in desperation, transgender individuals might resort to use of industrial-grade silicone, which is far cheaper, to achieve the brain/body match they feel comfortable with. Because the current ICD treats gender variance as a mental illness rather than a medical problem, insurance companies will not fund therapies that get a the root of gender dysphoria.
I sincerely hope the upcoming proposed revisions to ICD-11 will include de-pathologizing gender variance. I am deeply grateful to Professor Gruskin for making the larger connection of how healthcare and legal systems can embody cultural biases. As with other marginalized populations that have also been medically pathologized, legal bias can sometimes be scaffolded upon medical bias, which, in turn, absorbs the cultural biases of the day; they reinforce and depend on each other to claim legitimacy. This is why we need institutional changes to best achieve successful health outcomes.

The USC Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research hosted Benjamin Madley Tuesday to speak about the controversial murder of as many as 16,000 Native Americans by vigilantes, state volunteer militiamen and U.S. Army soldiers during the period between 1846 and 1873. 
Madley, an Associate Professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently published An American Genocide: The United States and the California Indian Catastrophe, 1846-1873 after conducting research on the topic of Native American history. He used the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention to define genocide and then prove, with historical evidence, how the removal of tens of thousands of California Native Americans during and after the Gold Rush by the United States government was an act of genocide. 
In order to accurately depict the historical events, Madley spent over a decade looking for relevant details to complete the stories in various archives in libraries and by visiting a variety of Native American tribes who have passed down stories through generations. The purpose of Madley’s work is to raise awareness of this genocide so reparations can be made for the generations affected.  
“It’s time for state and federal officials to acknowledge the genocide that happened here in California under United States rule,” Madley said. 
When asked about the inspiration for his research topic, Madley relayed a story about his childhood and how his experiences growing up shaped his interest in Native American history.
“I spent a lot of time in Karuk Country growing up where my father worked with Karuk people in Northern California,” Madley said. “So, at an early age, I was exposed to conflicts between natives and newcomers. Then, I came down to Los Angeles in high school and attended University High where the Indian mascot discussion was beginning and where students were discussing the fact that we were taking classes on ancient Tongva village site. That’s when I began to wonder ‘Where are all the Indians?’ But I only really began deeply investigating California Indian history in graduate school.”
Madley’s work and passion for genocide reflects the overall purpose of the USC Shoah Foundation to provide curious students with the resources and opportunities to pursue higher learning in the field of genocide. 
The USC Shoah Foundation was first founded by Steven Spielberg in 1994 to collect and preserve testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Since then, the organization has expanded to collect testimonies from other major international tragedies, including the Rwandan, Armenian and Mayan genocides. Wolf Gruner, the founding director of the foundation, established the Center for Advanced Genocide Research to raise awareness of the work that is being done in the field of genocide. Gruner, in an attempt to encourage interdisciplinary research on genocide, also provides fellowships and internships to bring scholars to USC and encourage USC scholars to research various genocides using the foundation’s extensive database of testimonies and information.

The USG Senate meeting Tuesday night centered around a common theme: an emphasis on the support of the wellness and safety of USC students. 
USG Vice President Austin Dunn gave an update on the advocacy branch’s projects. Some major updates in academics include being able to view a course’s syllabus during class registration and a survey to assess the competency of course plans given to students by their advisers. In the wellness affairs area of the advocacy branch, major points of discussion were long health center wait times and medical excuses from classes. The issue of students simply trying to get out of doing work with a doctor’s note led to questions about the adequacy of doctor’s notes and what to do if that excuse was not sufficient for a professor.
Director of Communications Luke Southwell-Chan also provided an update on the projects that the communications branch of USC is working on. Next week will be Sexual Assault Awareness Week, which will involve a collaboration with other Pac-12 schools. The communications branch will also work on promoting upcoming elections and transferring the website to the cloud.
Senator Tyler Matheson proposed removing the paragraph on USCards that defines the card as property of USC in favor of adding mental health resource information to the card. Specifically, the back of the card would include numbers for DPS, the counseling center and Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services. 
However, Matheson acknowledged concerns that the change would make it difficult to validate the validity of the cards.
“There’s a way to work around that with SCampus, and there are many other universities that don’t have [the identification as property of the campus] on there,” Matheson said. “If this gets pushed to administration, that would be their biggest concern.”
Matheson’s proposal will be debated further by the Senate at next week’s meeting.

 New evidence was presented Tuesday in the trial of Alejandra Guerrero, who is charged with the homicide of USC graduate student Xinran Ji. The prosecution showed videos of Ji leaving his apartment the night he was murdered, of Guerrero and the other suspects attacking Ji with a baseball bat and of a beaten and bleeding Ji returning home.
The court began the day’s proceedings by analyzing Facebook messages from Guerrero’s account, which included mentions of drugs including marijuana and crystal meth. The messages also referenced “flocking” during the night Ji was killed. “Flocking” is a term used to describe robbing, and established a motive for Ji’s murder.
 Next, Detective Matt Courtney was called to the witness stand. He brought up text messages planning to “jack” or rob someone that night.
 Prosecutor John McKinney then showed a video of the beating, where it showed Ji confronted by what appeared to be Andrew Garcia, then Guerrero, then Alberto Ochoa. Garcia and Ochoa will be tried separately at a later date. 
In the video, Ochoa used a bat against Ji, then handed it to Garcia. When Ji began to run, Garcia chased him with the bat, and Guerrero soon followed with a wrench. Both tools delivered the fatal blows. Jonathan del Carmen, another suspect and a fifth person, never stepped out of the car.
 McKinney then delivered a closing argument to the jury. 
“A 2D photograph — that’s how we’ve come to know him. But before Guerrero and her friends slaughtered him, he was a person,” the prosecutor said, pointing to a picture of a smiling Ji on the overhead screen.
McKinney described Ji as warm and compassionate as well as analytical and creative.
 “[Ji was] someone who bought into this concept of delayed gratification, someone who put work first, someone who studied hard, and someone who put off the frivolities of life for another time,” McKinney said. “And when I thought about that, I thought it was particularly sad that somebody who frontloaded life with his studies never got the chance to enjoy the fruits of his labor.”
However, McKinney admitted that over the span of the past two years, he had come around to a different way of thinking about Ji.
“Xinran didn’t delay gratification; his work was his gratification,” McKinney said. “The way he should be remembered is not the way he was found at 7 o’clock in the morning on July 25. The way he should be remembered is the way he lived.”
The prosecutor remarked that Ji didn’t drive around in cars at midnight looking for people to rob or assault, so he could smoke weed or drink alcohol, but instead loved his studies, loved engineering, loved being part of study groups and spending time with his classmates.
“What Guerrero and her friends took away from him is something so basic as waking up in the morning, smiling, breathing — [they] took away from us whatever promise this young man held,” McKinney said.  
The last minutes of Ji’s life, McKinney noted, were spent walking a friend home from a study group, where he had just spent four hours working with a team on a project.
“He didn’t stop at 29th and Orchard and say ‘See ya! You got the bike, call me when you get home, this is my stop, I’m just gonna walk from here,’” McKinney said. “He walked her all the way to her front door and then attempted to walk all the way back home; that’s just the kind of person he was.”
McKinney said that Ji had no way of knowing that Guerrero and her friends were in the neighborhood, or what would happen that night.
“When you think about this case, it’s tempting to think ‘Man, one more minute either way and maybe they don’t see him, maybe he makes it home, maybe if the study group ended five minutes early, maybe there was some sort of delay, maybe he makes it home,’” McKinney said. “It’s tempting to think about things like that, but we shouldn’t have to. One minute or five minutes more or less should not make the difference between life and death at the hands of another person in a civilized society.”

Photo from Mindy KalingWonder women · Mindy Kaling was the only woman and person of color when she worked as a writer for the NBC comedy series The Office, according to an interview with Sonia Kharkar. Kharkar worked as a showrunner’s assistant on The Mindy Project after graduating from the School of Cinematic Arts.
As a senior at the School of Cinematic Arts, I know the film school devotes special attention toward providing an education on the titans of film’s past. Entire classes devoted to Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg detail the creation and rise of these iconic, almost mythical figures in the film industry.
More modern-oriented classes have also shifted the lens toward television — pointing to bigwigs such as Breaking Bad’s Vince Gilligan or The Sopranos’ David Chase, who both ushered television into its golden age and changed audiences’ expectations for the medium. 
However, among the male titans of television, there also exists the female sphere — names like Lena Dunham and Mindy Kaling are often repeated, but are also in the minority. Their notability was born partly out of their exception to the norm — as women showrunners and creators are few and far between. And so, as a woman, I am more than inspired by their accomplishments. 
Yet, at this point in my life, I’ve found myself wondering about women who are closer to my age and working hard in the industry now. This week, I interviewed Sonia Kharkar, a USC alumna, who worked for two years as Mindy Kaling’s assistant before being promoted to a writer’s assistant on The Mindy Project in 2016. 
We spent most of the hour talking about gender differences in Hollywood, and I wanted to know if she had experienced any form of discrimination or difficulty as a woman in the industry.
Kharkar, who studied creative writing and English at Macalester College, applied to graduate school per the suggestion of her screenwriting teacher. Kharkar always had a predilection for half-hour television.
After graduating from the School of Cinematic Arts in 2011 with a Master’s degree in writing for screenwriting and television, she worked at an agency for a year and a half, starting in the mail room and then working up to assisting on two separate agent’s desks.
“I liked what I got out of it but I don’t know that I liked where I was. I had great bosses, but it’s a high volume environment,” Kharkar said. “You kind of become a number when you work there.”
After leaving the agency, Kharkar worked briefly as a showrunner’s assistant on a pilot that didn’t make it to the screen. She then found her way to the NBC show The Blacklist. Kharkar did acknowledge that while she loved working on The Blacklist, the environment was predominantly male.
“All the people making creative decisions were men in their 40s and 50s,” she said. “And for them, they just want to work with someone they know they can relate to in a language they understand.”
However, Kharkar’s experience at The Blacklist not only gave her a lot of professional experience on learning how a show is run, but also led her to working for Mindy Kaling on The Mindy Project.
In regard to diversity and competition among women in the writers’ room, Kharkar said that most of her friends are women and that her relationship with them isn’t exactly competitive. However, she feels that there is an unsaid stigma against women in television.
“The air [in writers’ rooms] is ‘oh we have one of them, that’s enough,’” she said. “I do think writer-wise, most of my friends who are writers here and at work are women. And I do think there is a younger generation of female writers coming up. But then it’s about the higher ups on the shows you want to get hired on, and they’re mostly men.”
When asked about her experience at USC, Kharkar believed that the program she was in provided a helpful environment for finding her place in writing comedy and being able to experience the gender differences within the classroom, noting that mostly men occupied her comedy classes and had their own language when talking about comedy.
For most of our interview, Kharkar and I discussed this relational discrepancy between men and women within the writers’ room.
“Our show is run by a woman, and I feel that a lot of women are getting more opportunities, but [the numbers are] still the reality,” Kharkar said. “Mindy Kaling started out as a writer at The Office in a room of six people and was the only woman and only woman of color. The way that that system worked, she kind of realized that the only way she could succeed in that type of environment was just to keep her head down and pretend she was one of them.”
Ultimately, Kharkar gave her final word of advice to student screenwriters.
“What happens at USC isn’t life or death. It’s just a matter of sticking with it,” she said. “The ends justify the means.”
Though her words did not sound too encouraging, her message should not be misconstrued in the least. As somebody — male or female — in the creative field, it’s clear you need the gumption to stick with it. And that seems to be the defining attribute in Kharkar’s career thus far.
Walking away from our interview, I realized that my place as a woman does not define my work. While it’s helpful to be aware of the numbers and the reality of women’s work in Hollywood, knowing these facts and living with them won’t help anyone land a job. 
What will help you is your work ethic and keeping your nose to the ground, something Kharkar — and by extension, her boss Mindy Kaling — knows plenty about.

Photo from WE ARE THE STREETSStreet cred · Danny Costanzo founded WeAreTheStreets.org as a philanthropic project to give back to the community. Costanzo and his team are in the process of organizing a film festival featuring homelesss individuals.
Everybody deserves a second chance. That’s what Danny Costanzo thought when he formed WeAreTheStreets.org, a philanthropic project under his company Costanzo Media. 
After completing his studies at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, Costanzo dabbled in the the film industry and formed his own talent management company. He also produced his first film, Lost in Austin. Shortly after, Costanzo made the decision to found his own media company — Costanzo Media. Among his aspirations, however, was a desire to give back to the community in a unique and creative way.
“With more than 50,000 people dealing with homelessness in LA, something just needs to be done,” Costanzo said. “The whole idea of giving food … it didn’t appeal to me, because I think helping needs to do much more than that.”
Earlier this year, Costanzo and his team began developing ideas for WeAreTheStreets.org. The project will be a film festival that will showcase the work of aspiring filmmakers and the talent of the homeless in Los Angeles’ Skid Row. 
WeAreTheStreets.org will help filmmakers and members of the community write, produce, act and film short films in their entirety. Afterward, the short films will be submitted for entry in the film festival. They will also be double-purposed as a way to raise funds for homeless communities that the filmmakers work with. 
The project aims to raise awareness about homeless people on Skid Row and also provide them with a platform to express their artistic abilities. Beyond this, a majority of funds raised from the film festival will go toward rehabilitation programs to help homeless individuals return to society as productive, working individuals. 
In addition, filmmakers who raise the most funds for their film submissions will win money for filmmaking equipment, pitch opportunities with film companies as well as have their short film distributed. WeAreTheStreets.org aims to create a beneficial relationship that will help both filmmakers and homeless individuals.
“We want to show that [the people on] Skid Row are also individuals,” said Roxanne Martinez, who serves as the chief operating officer of Costanzo Media. “This project isn’t about sob stories or documentaries — it’s about showing the world that homeless people are just as capable and talented as any other person.”
To start their project, Costanzo and filmmakers at WeAreTheStreets.org went to Skid Row and reached out to homeless crowds. Approximately 50 notepads were handed out to individuals throughout the area so that they could develop ideas about what they wanted to do. 
“Contrary to what people might think, the suggestions we’ve gotten for the films have been quite interesting,” Martinez said. “Some of them were definitely a little wacky, but some of them were actually quite good.” 
WeAreTheStreets.org will launch its Indiegogo campaign on Nov. 7. In the meantime, Costanzo and his team will continue to work with the homeless and further develop their project plan.

Photo from CurtsyDress to impress · Curtsy, an app started by students at University of Mississippi that allows college students to rent dresses from each other, recently launched at USC. The app has a variety of dresses that people can rent.
After watching his date rustle through her closet and not knowing what to wear, Curtsy co-founder and University of Mississippi student William Ault decided to take matters into her own hands and build a dress rental system at her university. Now, this rental system has expanded to 16 other campuses, with a recent arrival at USC. 
Curtsy is an app that allows female college students to rent dresses from each other in their neighborhood. Women are able to browse the closets of people around the area and post their own dresses and articles of clothing to make money. Curtsy is currently run by Mississippi students Eli Allen, David Oates and Ault.
The app is free to download on any Apple device and charges a $5 flat charge from the borrower to ensure that the damages are accounted for. Curtsy ensures the safety of users’ closets by insuring up to $1,000 in case of any damages. 
The USC Curtsy app launch created an overwhelming response. 
“College women typically need 20 dresses a year for events and formal occasions, particularly if they’re involved in the Greek system,” said Caitlin Tran, USC’s Curtsy campus director. Tran is a junior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and also serves as the blogs editor for the Daily Trojan. 
“The day we launched at USC, I visited many of the sorority houses to share the news, and women were really excited that they could make money from all the dresses not being used in their closets,” Tran said. 
Curtsy gives users a way to do borrow clothes without the awkwardness of asking. 
After the launch, word has been quickly spreading through USC, with effective marketing during the launch, according to Tran. As the campus director, she is making sure that more measures are being to make the women at USC aware of the app. Tran explained the practical and economic benefits of the app.
“Everyone has nice dresses in their closets that are only worn once every few months,” Tran said. “Students can make easy extra money by putting those dresses on Curtsy to be borrowed by other students.” 
As campus director, Tran plans to continue her plans to expand user engagement between USC students and Curtsy through events. 
“We’re planning on hosting trunk shows on campus so students can see the wide variety of dresses that are available to rent on Curtsy,” Tran said. 
The trunk show would be held on campus, after inviting users already on the app to have their clothes picked up.  The trunk show would allow users to browse what is available on the app in-person.
When Tran asked to share her own personal experiences or what she witnessed when the app launched, she described it as an amazing moment.
“When my classmates at USC first started uploading outfits to Curtsy on our launch date, I got to see some gorgeous dresses that I didn’t even know my friends had,” Tran said.
When asked about the problem about not including males, Tran explained the mission of Curtsy. 
“Curtsy is currently focusing on solving a unique problem for many women in college that doesn’t exist for most college men,” Tran said. “There is nothing stopping men from downloading the app, signing up and requesting to borrow dresses.”
Harini Reddy, a master’s student in computer science, loves the app. She shared that it allows her to experiment with different fashion trends. However, being a graduate student, she doesn’t have enough time to shop.
“It is truly a blessing to have Curtsy come to USC. Now all I have to do is browse through my phone to get an online shopping experience but at a much easier and cost-effective way,” Reddy said.

Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanEyes on the prize · Despite ranking eighth in the nation in passer rating, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has three fumbles.
Coming off of a 21-17 victory over Colorado, the Trojans began gearing up for another conference battle. On Saturday, USC will travel to Tucson where they will face the Wildcats in their only road game during the month of October.
Scouting Arizona
Due to injuries at the quarterback position, the Wildcats haven’t announced who their starter will be, but Helton sees enough similarity in them to prepare for each of them in the same way defensively.
“I’ve been very impressed with them offensively, especially at quarterback. I know they’ve had injuries,” head coach Clay Helton said. “One thing they do, is they are all extremely good at running the football.”
To prepare for the Wildcat defense, Helton said there would be a lot of film study for redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold to do. Arizona disguises their defensive schemes and is very aggressive, something which Helton and his staff are preparing for.
Ball Security
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold has provided a spark to the offense, but has had three fumbles in three starts, including two on Saturday. Darnold said he is aware of the problem and has made it a priority.
“To be honest, in the game, I don’t think about it, which is something that has to change,” Darnold said. “I’m not mindful enough of the ball. That needs to change and it will.”
The offense is averaging 635.33 yards per game since Darnold took control of the offense and he ranks eighth in the nation in passer rating.
“No one can stop us so far if we don’t turn it over,” Darnold said. “We’re only killing ourselves. We’re going to go as far as we want ourselves to go.”
Injury Report
The Trojans have been banged up and continue to be. The greatest loss is senior running back Justin Davis who suffered a high ankle sprain on Saturday and is listed as likely to be out for this weekend. In Davis’ absence Helton said he expects to see a lot more from sophomore running back Ronald Jones II.
“He’s getting there,” Helton said. “Between the tackles, I’m hoping the reps in real, live-game action will help him. I truly think the kid is ready for a breakout game.”
Additionally, senior right tackle Zach Banner is still questionable, though he did practice Tuesday.
“It’s just hurt not being out there,” Banner said. “We’re a tough team. I think we’ve gotten better every single week, and I couldn’t be any prouder of my guys.”
Redshirt senior defensive end Jabari Ruffin has been cleared from concussion protocol. Redshirt senior tight end Taylor McNamara is struggling with back and quad injuries. Junior defensive back Jonathan Lockett practiced despite still dealing with shoulder injury, and senior linebacker Michael Hutchings was limited in practice by his shoulder injury.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanStar power · Junior corner back, returner and wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson was honored with the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week Award that is given to one player each week for an exceptional performance.
Junior three-way star Adoree’ Jackson was named the Lott IMPACT Player of the Week, which was announced on Tuesday.
Jackson was honored for his performance in the Trojans’ 21-17 win over Colorado on Saturday. As a cornerback, Jackson had six tackles and an acrobatic interception. As USC’s return man, Jackson had a 38-yard kickoff return to tie the record for USC career kick return yards. He added four punt returns for 50 yards including one 47-yard dash. Jackson also played one snap on offense during the victory.
As part of the Lott weekly award, the Pacific Club IMPACT Foundation, which sponsors the Lott IMPACT Trophy, is making a $1,000 donation to USC’s general scholarship fund.
Jackson is leading the nation in punt returns, averaging 18.7 yards, and is eighth in the country in kickoff returns with a 31.7-yard average. 
Jackson leads the team with two interceptions and is tied for fourth with 30 tackles. Jackson also has one fumble recovery this year. He is second on the team in all-purpose yards with an average of 88.0 yards per game. He is behind only senior running back Justin Davis, who averages 94.2 total yards per game. Offensively, Jackson has one rush for 11 yards.
In addition to their weekly award, the Lott IMPACT Foundation honors one defensive player with the Lott IMPACT Trophy each year. The trophy is given based equally on athletic performance and personal attributes.

Photo courtesy of Jordan ArteagaKick it! · The P.E. department had 1,919 students in 2000 and had 5,013 students in 2015. This rise has been credited to many things, one being the fact that students deem physical education worthwhile post-graduation.
It is a lazy, hot afternoon, and Ian Culbertson’s Wednesday, 1 p.m. stress management class saunters onto Brittingham Intramural Field.
 The first order of business? Split into three groups, form circles and pass a soccer ball around while saying the name of the recipient.
 “All I hear is, ‘Suh,’” Culbertson said to one student, perhaps fibbing a classmate’s name. “Learn each other’s names!”
 A couple of newcomers walk in and join in on one of the circles.
 “We’ve got two new additions,” Culbertson said to the group. “Learn their names.”
 For the next 50 minutes, there will be no class to sit through, no notes to take, no readings to worry about. After all, this is a class on stress management. For the next 50 minutes, students will unwind by playing soccer — a basic, yet effective activity that gets the endorphins flowing, encourages teamwork and trust and carries them away from the unforgiving grind of college life. 
 That’s the overarching goal of USC’s physical education program, which has grown into a popular option for students seeking to mix exercise and relaxation into their class schedule. It offers a variety of classes from the more traditional physical conditioning to two levels of yoga classes, along with Kundalini yoga and meditation.     
 “I hope [students] can understand where stress comes from,” Culbertson said on the goals of the stress management class. “So teaching them about nutrition, the importance of exercise and time management helps to enforce what you need to protect your body and your mind from stress.”
In addition to soccer, Culbertson’s class does a variety of activities to relieve stress, including yoga, core exercises, ultimate Frisbee, capture the flag, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation techniques.
Culbertson spoke to the various activities helping to mitigate the body’s “fight or flight” response to stress.
 “One of the best ways to do that is through forms of exercise,” he said. “We exercise in different ways to alleviate those toxins that are in the body.”
 Every class also has a lecture component, where students learn about living a healthy lifestyle and how to apply the activities to their everyday lives.
 Over at the Lyon Center, Sarah Hayes starts off her Friday 10 a.m. weight training class with a review session. There is a midterm in two weeks, and she is going through terms, such as what antagonistic muscles do (oppose the action of another muscle), what the difference is between elasticity and excitability (both are characteristics of muscle tissue) and what reversibility is (losing the results of training after not working out).
 Then, it’s off to the weight room to turn the terms into action, as Hayes demonstrates the proper technique for a lat-pulldown and seated row.
 Like Culbertson, she echoed how beneficial P.E. classes are toward relieving stress.
 “We realize how stressed students are,” she said. “Stress management is so important in today’s society in general. It’s great to have the [physical education department] offering those classes so the students can have that de-stressing. I always teach that they should be coming to PED classes to de-stress and not be stressed.” 
In addition to helping with stress, the classes give students a chance to be active, which Hayes said is becoming more difficult with advancements in technology.
 “They’re here to sit and study, and I understand that,” she said. “So we have to take that time, make that time every day, at least five days a week to try to keep moving.” 
Her students seem to be grasping the objective. Eric Gonzalez, a junior majoring in anthropology, said he only did cardio at the gym before taking this class and learning proper weight training techniques. Now, he enjoys the guidance from Hayes along with the break it provides in his class schedule.
 “It takes out some anxiety,” he said. “Helps you sleep better.”
Though opting to take P.E. classes counts as one or two extra units — there is the opportunity to audit a class — students say it is well worth the commitment.
 “It doesn’t impose on anything,” said Stephanie Saisi, a sophomore majoring in business administration and Italian. “I only have this class once a week, but I wish I had it every day.”
 Both Culbertson and Hayes say their students are primarily non-athletes from different years, ranging from freshmen to Ph.D. students.
 “It’s a good option for a lot of those majors that find themselves doing a lot of work and sitting down a lot,” Culbertson said. “I’m sure all majors do a lot of work. There’s some that need a lot of self-care. It would be great for all students to have this kind of class. It helps enforce what they need to learn and what they need to do to take care of themselves.”
 Demand for a spot in P.E. classes has never been higher. Over 5,000 students took a P.E. class last school year — the most in the program’s history — continuing a 15-year trend of an increase  in total enrollment. The program has come a long way from the 1,919 sign-ups in 2000, when the PED department broke from being a subsidiary under exercise science and became an independent P.E. program, according to Steve Vankanegan, the director of physical education.
 Vankanegan attributed the growth in the program to a strong group of instructors and students who want to get the most out of their USC experience and then recommending classes to others via word of mouth.
 “We’re seeing in instructor evaluations that students indicate it was so worth their while,” Vankanegan said. “They say, ‘It’s the most productive class I’ve had on campus.’ People are thinking, ‘This is of value to me when I graduate, and not just a workout.’”
 Vankanegan said that surfing is one of the most popular classes offered, and the two new classes added this semester — health coaching and Kundalini yoga and meditation — filled up quickly.
 It’s a testament to both the quality of the P.E. program and students’ desire to find middle ground between hitting the books and hitting the gym.
 “It’s just what we need in today’s society — especially on campus — to have that balance,” Hayes said. “[Students are] learning a little more about themselves and how to live that balanced lifestyle for the rest of their lives. Find that time and make that time for yourself.”
 Culbertson offered the following to anyone who has not taken up that opportunity.
 “If you haven’t taken a P.E. class yet, you should,” he said. “Choose any class and check it out. I guarantee you, once you take one P.E. class, you’ll want to take another one.”

If you want to have a championship water polo team, your goalie needs to be the backbone of the team.
At least that is the case according to junior goalie McQuin Baron. Baron is wracking up accolades and records. He is a two-time All-American and is second on USC’s list for career saves. Perhaps the most impressive accolade, though, is that the humble Baron was an Olympian this year.
“I didn’t deserve to walk out in the opening ceremonies with the greatest Olympian of all time, but it’s still awesome,” Baron said.
Baron was talking about Michael Phelps. His favorite memories from the Olympics come from walking out during the opening ceremonies next to the swimming star as well as meeting the basketball team and watching swimming finals with Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin.
“The Olympics unites people in sport,” Baron said. “It doesn’t matter who you are as a person or how high profile you are. While you’re there, you are equal with everyone.”
Even for the highly competitive Baron, playing at the Olympics was more than just a tournament that the Americans didn’t win. The American team fell short in group play, winning two of their four games and failed to advance to the quarterfinals.
“I’ll forever be an Olympian, but to a certain extent it’s really disappointing — even heartbreaking — because you work for four years to get to a certain level, and we could’ve trained for an extra month and still done just as well,” Baron said. “You start playing your games and realize it’s a just another tournament, but on a much higher level. You’re playing the same teams from the previous four years; the same people and you still have the same goal of wanting to win.”
Baron took the spring semester off academically in order to train for the Olympics and dedicated approximately six hours a day to the sport. Team USA lifted weights from 6 a.m.- 7:30 a.m., practiced in the pool until noon, and had an afternoon session from 12:30 p.m.- 2:30 p.m. On top of that, three times a week the team returned from 5 p.m.- 7 p.m. for an additional practice. 
Baron said his favorite part about the training period was getting to live at home with his family and other collegiate Olympians who were staying with him. 
Baron also said his experience has made him an even better player this year, specifically playing against such high-level athletes on a daily basis.
The summer competition also made Baron realize the difference between collegiate athletics and professional athletics.
“College water polo is harder because you have so much more on your mind,” Baron said. “You’re still playing a sport that you love, and we play it because we love it. It isn’t your job, and that’s what you need to find success.”
For Baron, success hasn’t been hard to come by. The Tustin native already has 125 saves this season, bringing his career total to 695; good enough for second on USC’s all-time saves list. The record holder remains former Trojan Joel Dennerley, who wrapped up 855 saves while winning four national titles. That elusive first national title, is now Baron’s only focus.
“I could end my four years here and have every record, but if I don’t have a national championship, no one will remember me. Everyone will remember them,” Baron said.
The team is returning this season as one of the most experienced groups in the country, having retained their key people from deep NCAA tournament runs in the past.
“We have the best core group and our connection is unbelievable,” Barons said. “Now, there is no excuse.”
Baron said he has 100 percent confidence in this team to win the title this year. For as much fun as it was to play for Team USA, Baron said he loves playing for USC where the fans and everyone involved with the success of the program are closer to home.
“We have the experience,” Baron said. “I think we have the most experienced team in the NCAA and we have the most talented, so there’s really no excuse to not win.”
Regardless, Baron will be between the pipes, just where the backbone of a team should be.

On Aug. 9, I logged onto Facebook. Not for no reason, though. I was interning in D.C. and checking to see if my flight home that weekend would get me to Los Angeles in time for my roommate Weston’s 21st birthday party. We had his whole semester abroad that past spring to catch up on and an entire year of senior shenanigans to start planning — the Weekender at Stanford was obviously a must, and he had also suggested crashing with his friends at Arizona when the Trojans visited the Wildcats on Oct. 15. 
I spent probably the next hour reading about the top headline on my newsfeed that night: An Arizona football player had inexplicably died in his sleep the night before. 
His name was Zach Hemmila. A redshirt senior, he was fighting to finally break into a starting spot on the Wildcats’ offensive line. He had appeared in all 13 of Arizona’s games the year before, but less than half of those were starts. He was a favorite to lock down the center spot. But he never got the chance, dying a month before the team’s home opener, at only age 22, going into what should have been his final year in college. 
On the football side, it’s left a physical hole in the armor of a Wildcat team that has struggled all year since. Hemmila was one of six returning offensive linemen who had significant playing time the year before for a unit that averaged just over 31 points a game. But the Wildcats have dropped all three of their Pac-12 matchups and are now onto their fourth starting quarterback due to injuries. Arizona has gone from a divisional champion and New Years’ Six-bowl game representative in 2014 to the only winless team in the division two years later, in serious danger of missing a bowl game. 
More importantly, though, the loss of Hemmila leaves a personal void. Hemmila was one of only four fifth-year seniors on the roster. He was really like any other player, by no means a star. But that’s what makes his story important. 
Hemmila was almost kicked off the team multiple times. Not for anything bad. Head coach Rich Rodriguez just openly questioned his commitment to the program as an underclassman. He was big, but he wasn’t making the most of his potential. Five of his six starts as a junior were in the first five games of the season, before he was relegated to a backup. 
“I challenged him,” Rodriguez told ESPN. “I wasn’t sure he loved football. He teared up, and said, ‘No coach, I really do.’” 
This past offseason was when he finally got it going, doubling down on the field and during workouts, and it looked like the results were going to pay off. Rodriguez said they had sat down and spoken for almost an hour just days before he passed about how excited he was about everything going on in his life headed into his final season.
“He showed it,” Rodriguez said. “I wanted to see that response. And he turned that corner. It was the happiest I’d seen him in five years.”
And Hemmila’s ascent back into a starting spot probably wasn’t going to result in an NFL contract. He was good, but not that good. There’s still a huge gap between a solid Power Five conference player and a professional. He probably would have been able to keep his scholarship by doing just enough to stay on the practice squad. I can’t think of any real extrinsic motivation behind him finally reaching his full on-field potential. 
The only apparent reason is the same one any amateur athlete can relate to. He just wanted to give his all for his teammates. He wanted to play. He bought into this irrational tendency we sports fans have to define our identity by the ability of a group of kids to throw an oblong leather object in pursuit of completely arbitrary objectives. He lived for this the past couple months. We live for this. 
For those of us who believe in the omnipotence of the football gods — much like the baseball gods who empowered Dee Gordon to hit his only home run in 315 at bats this season the day after losing his dear friend and teammate Jose Fernandez — Arizona is due for a conference win dedicated to Hemmila. I don’t think it will happen this weekend, which will make it all the more sweet when the Wildcats knock off rivals Arizona State to notch their only division win on what would have been Hemmila’s Senior Day on Nov. 25. 
The tragedy puts all of USC’s recent struggles into perspective. Who ultimately wins and loses these games still doesn’t inherently matter. Sure, tradition is strong and expectations are high here, but worrying about being trapped under a 10-win ceiling for an extended period of time is really something fans should be grateful for. I mean this in no way to dilute the seriousness of the ongoing felony rape charges against former Trojan football player Osa Masina — especially as certain public figures use the excuse of “locker room” culture to justify similarly deplorable degradation of others. That is an aspect of USC athletics that inherently does matter. The number of head coaches we’ve hired in four years really doesn’t.            
Hemmila’s sudden death poses many of life’s great questions of which I’m equally qualified to punt on. It shouldn’t be a call for unabridged “yoloing.” Go to class, study for that midterm, apply for a job. What makes his death so tragic is that it’s so unlikely. But it should be a stark reminder of what really matters, and what we should all be making the most of, especially for us in our last year of college and on the verge of entering the real world. It’s not about capitalizing on our last year to nap, Netflix and defer responsibility during weekdays. 
So tomorrow night, Weston and I are driving to Tucson. Or Friday. We haven’t mapped out our exact carpool plan with the rest of our roommates as of press time. But we’re still set to stay with his friends from high school, who all crashed at our place for the U of A game last year. It will probably be the last time we all will see each other together. 
On Saturday, with about 50,000 other complete strangers inside Arizona Stadium, we’re going to watch a football game.

Being the Commander in Chief for a country as large and globally important as the United States is no easy endeavor. Most candidates seem to grasp this before they start campaigning for the position so that they can truly commit themselves to the cause. Many of these candidates, once elected, use the position to attempt to better the nation — and not just for their personal gain. Unfortunately, the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump does not seem to understand the weight of his decisions and has drawn global attention for his remarks. In light of current events, he should not be permitted to continue his campaign.
 Not only is Trump proving to be a bad leader, but he also does not have the political support of his own party anymore. Earlier last week, hidden footage from 2005 resurfaced where Trump was seen talking to one of his colleagues about a woman that he was about to meet. In 2005, he was a businessman who was very used to appearing on television, and this may have prompted him to believe that women give him what he wants because of his position over them. This is not an isolated incident: Trump has repeatedly been caught slut-shaming women and degrading them regularly, and he did not seem particularly remorseful for this incident either. Yet for many Republicans, this was the final straw — important representatives from his own political party have either withdrawn their endorsements or publicly spoken against Trump. Even before the 2005 tapes surfaced, Sen. Ted Cruz, who ran against him in the primaries, urged voters at the Republican National Convention to “vote with [their] conscience.” More recently, and more importantly, Trump’s own running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, stated that he could not condone or defend Trump’s sexist remarks (despite maintaining his overall support for the candidate.) Pence also refused to attend a rally with Speaker Paul Ryan the next day, one that he was attending on Trump’s behalf. As if these two examples were not enough, there are more than 30 congressional Republicans who have spoken out against Trump, calling on him to resign his presidential bid.
 This lack of support really speaks to the high caliber of disapproval amidst the Republican Party regarding their presidential nominee. Prominent policymakers do not believe in their own delegation’s nominee, so where does that leave GOP public opinion? The fact that he has lost so much of this backing just from within his own party serves as a testament to Trump’s inability to serve and act as a respectable Republican nominee.
 Perhaps the GOP representatives are simply looking out for the U.S. narrative. By electing someone as high-profile as Trump, the U.S. government draws much unwanted attention and suspicion to itself. A real estate developer, Trump has never held a post in public service, has never served in the military. He has spent a lifetime building up a business empire that has always prioritized his own interests. Global leaders are terrified that he will dismantle longstanding agreements because of his inexperience in the field, and have already begun using him as the butt of many jokes. This is a terrifying prospect: America is still seen (perhaps undeservingly) as the leader of the free world, and electing Trump would ruin any credibility we might still have after letting him get this far.
 After electing President Barack Obama eight years ago, electing a racist, sexist and xenophobic business mogul directly afterward would be, at the very least, a step back for the nation. And given all the recent proliferation of civil rights activism, this is not the kind of legacy our generation should leave behind. For whatever reason, this last video seems to have been the last that we can tolerate of Trump, and it is not clear how much lower he can stoop before America definitively votes for Democratic presidential nominee Clinton, but one thing is for sure: Trump does not deserve to stay in the presidential race.

Maybe the author should stick to writing about global health, as the evidence she presents for a downtrodden America is no different than what every populist panic has been sparked by since the 1800s. The author was probably part of the same group of idiots who exaggerated the “China Scare” in the late 2000s. Previous to them were the still idiotic, but at least more respectable, “Japan Scare” folks of the 1990s. Everyone loves talking about how much debt we’re in blah, blah, blah without the slightest idea of how debt works. It’s not as simple as your average student loan, for example. I’m not even going to try explaining it on here since it would be a waste of time, but do your research. As much as I don’t like Donald Trump, to say that he should drop out and allow Hilary Clinton to go unchallenged is the stupidest possible alternative that I’ve ever heard. To make a much longer thought short, the author clearly decided to write for the paper to pad the ole resume for her assumed-health profession application. Obviously she cares very little for how obtuse she sounds in public. Lucky for the author, the medical schools she may be applying to are spared from having to read such a lazily put together piece of penmanship.
Shweta, please stop drinking the leftist mainstream media’s kool-aid.  They would have you, and everyone else, believe the presidential race is over based on a video.  Their hypocrisy is mind numbing.  How many celebrities in America, and around the world for that matter, think the same way about certain women and act upon it?  The certain women Trump is referring to are called “gold diggers.”  
What should be more concerning is the fact that America has a biased press.  Can they provide the public with fair and unbiased information so that we can select an appropriate presidential candidate based on anything half way intelligent?  Clearly, the answer is no.  They are the reason why we have two incorrigible candidates that nobody likes.  They made politics entertainment and we, the people, will pay a heavy price for this brand of entertainment.
Are you a total moron? America is NOT seen as the world leader. After 8 years of weak Obama leadership, reckless borrowing, and misguided international policy… America is crashing. HRC would be a disaster as President, and America will be unrecognizable and unlivable with her as President!
Seems like you’re the total moron, get out of your Fox News bubble once in a while,
Name calling like you’ve just done demonstrates you have no arguments of substance.  Molly correctly states the US government debt is up substantially under Obama (2X to 20 $T).  Molly correctly notes our misguided international policy under Hillary/Obama – like bombing Libya (what no declaration of war?) resulting the death of 4 diplomats.  Etc.  Come back with facts if you expect anyone to pay attention.

Creating a scandal that surprised no one, Access Hollywood tapes from 2005 released on Friday recorded Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump engaging in a lewd and repulsive discussion about his past sexual advances toward women. In the recording, Trump says, “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them,” and “And when you’re a star, they let you do it… You can do anything… Grab them by the p-ssy.” 
For obvious reasons, numerous top Republicans such as Sen. John McCain have subsequently rebuked Trump. Some like Jon Huntsman and Condoleezza Rice have called for him to drop out of the race entirely. Rice wrote on Facebook, “Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw. As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth.”  In the midst of these sharp criticisms, Trump has remained defiant.  He said, “No, I’m not quitting. I have tremendous support.” He expressed that he would not let down the people who supported him and, perhaps, he shouldn’t. This recent controversy is certainly not the first time Trump has said something terribly offensive. He has made extremely disrespectful comments many times, almost too many to count, and his supporters have consistently remained loyal. However, Trump’s continued campaign still serves a purpose: to show that his brand of hate cannot win in America.
While members of the Republican elite may define Trump’s recorded comments as the tipping point, this latest revelation likely does little to shake the fundamental reasons Trump’s supporters like him. Dan Pfeffier, former communications director under President Barack Obama, tweeted: “I have heard dozens of GOP elites rescind their support of Trump over these comments, but have yet to hear an anecdote of a voter doing so.” No establishment candidate’s statement or recanted endorsement will erode passion for Trump among those dedicated to him and who despise that very establishment. 
Trump’s supporters voted for him in the midst of numerous scandals and derogatory comments. They had no illusions about who he is, and they still chose him. In The New York Times, Andrew Rosenthal wrote of the recently released recording: “it showed us nothing new about Trump. He’s been insulting women all year, along with Mexican immigrants, Muslims, gay Americans and people with disabilities.” Trump’s supporters feel that he best represents their concerns and these sorts of highly outrageous comments have not and will not deter their loyalty. This is their candidate of choice and he has every right to stay in the race, not only for himself but also for the many Americans who voted for him. However, these staunch loyalists alone will likely not win him the presidency. 
McCain said that Trump  “alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.” Those consequences should be a harsh loss against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He should absolutely stay in the race, not because he is a legitimate candidate, but just in order to lose. To eradicate Trump and his brand of detestable politics, Trump must not just be defeated, but definitively so. Let him limp to Election Day battered by the press and without the support of most of his party leaders. He should stay in and hopefully get shellacked on Election Day. If Trump were to drop out of the race, questions could linger over his potential success or what could have been. Clinton resolutely defeating Trump at the ballot box is the only way to soundly rebuke him, his comments, and his detestable type of politics.

Using the writer’s logic, Hillary should be definitively defeated due to her brand of detestable politics.  The sword cuts both ways.

Q: What are your pieces of advice for developing confidence? 
A: This answer sucks to write but sometimes developing confidence takes time. Very few people are born confident. Confidence doesn’t occur overnight. There will also be days when you feel less confident, days when you feel overconfident, and certainly days when you’re unsure of what confidence even means. 
Confidence is something that exudes off of you, and so I think the best piece of advice I can give is to learn how to love yourself, be yourself, and support yourself.

 USC experienced a rise in crime over the past year, according to the Department of Public Safety’s Annual Safety Report, although it still experienced fewer total crimes than other comporable California universities, such as  Stanford University, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.
 While all four universities had zero cases of reported murder and non-negligent manslaughter, they vary considerably in regards to other crime categories. 
Sex offenses at USC increased from 31 reported incidents in 2014 to 41 in 2015. 
Twelve of the reported sex offenses in 2015 were committed by the same individual, who groped female students’ backsides as they passed by, which increased the “fondling” category by 12 counts.
 Sex offenses at UCLA decreased from 39 to 38, while those at Stanford increased from 30 to 39 and those at Berkeley decreased from 64 to 58.
Robberies at USC, including motor vehicle theft and burglary, increased from 47 reported incidents to 59, while they decreased from 129 to 100 in UCLA, increased from 79 to 93 in Stanford and decreased from 189 to 130 in Berkeley. 
Again, Berkeley has the most cases of reported robberies, among the four universities, while USC appears to have the least instances of such reports. 
 The arrests following possession of illegal substances and arms, including liquor, drugs and weapons, increased at USC from 31 to 43, decreased from 80 to 49 at UCLA, increased from 47 to 102 at Stanford and decreased from 346 to 327 at Berkeley. 
 Hate crimes at USC went up from one reported incident to two. In 2014, the one incident was of vandalism with a bias of religion, while the 2015 incidents were reports of bias of nationality. 
UCLA experienced a rise in hate crimes, with reported incidents increasing from two to five. 
Hate crimes at Stanford decreased from three reported incidents to two. Berkeley’s hate crimes decreased from nine instances of robbery, vandalism, and assault with a bias of race, religion, nationality, and sexual orientation to two instances of battery, with a bias of religion.
 Overall, USC had the least crimes among the compared universities in 2014 and 2015, with 141 and 161 instances of crime, respectively. UCLA had 275 in 2014 and 207 in 2015. In both years, Berkeley had the most crimes — 669 and 579, respectively.  However, it also experienced the biggest decline in crime, while Stanford experienced the largest rise in crime, from 166 to 221.
 Even though crimes at USC increased from 141 to 161 in 2015, the University has regularly updated security measures since 2012, when a gang-involved shooting on Halloween wounded four people. Shortly afterward, a secure campus perimeter was created from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m.

The USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute’s Laboratory of Neuro Imaging received a $21.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study epilepsy. The money will fund a team of researchers working on a project titled the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy, which aims to discover a cure for epilepsy and develop prevention treatments.
Epilepsy is characterized by periodic episodes of sensory disturbance, unconsciousness and convulsions, linked to abnormal electrical communication between neurons. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, the disorder is the fourth most common neurological disorder, behind migraine, stroke and Alzheimer’s.
The team of international researchers will focus on epilepsy caused following a traumatic brain injury as those types of brain damage can be reproduced and studied in animal models. The researchers also believe that a cure for post-traumatic epilepsy may lead to a cure for all types of epilepsy.
Arthur Toga, provost professor of ophthalmology at the Keck School of Medicine and director of the Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, said that grant funds will also be used to educate patients on how epilepsy develops and build bridges between centers for traumatic brain injuries and epileptic individuals, according to USC News.

Photo courtesy of the USC LGBT Resource CenterTrojan pride · USC students show their support for LGBT rights at the 2014 Los Angeles Pride Parade. Groups like the LGBT Resource Center, which organized the march, also help make athletics more inclusive.
Trojan athletes will wear shirts emblazoned with the logo “We Are SC” in rainbow font on Tuesday in honor of National Coming Out Day. On Monday afternoon, the shirts were heaped on the couch in the office of Donna Heinel, the senior associate athletic director at USC.
It’s a subtle show of support, Heinel said. But it’s something that Trojan athletes wanted — a way to create a positive impact for the LGBT population on campus. And the shirts are part of a wider campaign that Heinel and the USC LGBT Athletic Committee hope to expand throughout the year.
“We were thinking about a lot of ways to celebrate,” Heinel said. “The [athletes] said they wanted something that subtly shows support for gay student athletes and something that allies can wear proudly. It’s going to get people talking, and that’s really what we want to do.”
The LGBT Athletic Committee has existed for years, but in the last year it has been revitalized under a new group of leaders. This group includes Heinel, athletic personal development coordinator Whitney Rotrock, sports psychologist Nohelani Lawrence and associate women’s soccer coach Jen Klein. 
Together, this group is hoping to reshape the way in which USC Athletics approaches topics such as LGBT issues, inclusivity and social justice. Due to the significance of athletics on campus, the committee hopes to begin setting an example of acceptance for the entire Trojan community.
“It has a large trickle down effect,” said Kelby Harrison, director of the LGBT Resource Center. “The climate and culture of our athletics department affects every student at USC and even our national reputation.”
Traditionally, the world of sports has gained a stereotype of being unaccepting of openly LGBT athletes, particularly in hyper-masculine arenas such as football or men’s basketball. With little visibility, many athletes felt uncomfortable expressing themselves fully in teams throughout their careers.
The committee hopes to change this by creating a positive culture and environment for LGBT athletes and their teammates throughout the University. Klein feels that today’s collegiate athletes are already far ahead of previous generations of athletes in their comfort and acceptance of the LGBT community. The LGBT Athletic Committee’s role is to supplement the athlete experience, providing programming and support when necessary.
“So many of these athletes are already so comfortable with who they are,” Klein said. “It’s really incredible to see how much better these issues have gotten, even in just the last few years. It’s our job to just keep that going, to keep asking them what they need and what’s most important to them.”
This goes far beyond just LGBT issues. Heinel and Klein recognize that social issues play an integral role in the lives of students, and those issues can’t always be separated from their roles as athletes. The committee hopes to create a space where these discussions — no matter how hard or uncomfortable — can take place for athletes on campus.
Earlier this season, six players from the women’s soccer team decided to kneel during the national anthem before a Pac-12 game to raise awareness for victims of police brutality. This type of decision is not simple or easy, according to Heinel. The players spoke to the administration, their coaching staff and their team before ultimately deciding to continue with the peaceful protest. 
Heinel and the committee hope to continue these types of conversations. Ultimately, their goal parallels the overall goal of the USC administration — to create an open, accepting environment for all students. By doing so, the committee believes that the USC sports programs will only continue to excel. 
“It’s better for athletics teams because when you’re accepting, you’re bringing in the best athletes,” Harrison said. “That means LGBT, that means racial and ethnic identities. It’s how you succeed because you’re drawing from the widest pool.”
Only half an hour after Heinel sent out an email letting all the teams know that the LGBT shirts were waiting in her office, three athletes were already waiting in the lobby to pick up shirts for themselves, their teammates and coaches. 
Heinel grinned as she exited her office and greeted each athlete. She knows that the group donning the shirts on Tuesday might be small, but she believes the impact that each shirt makes is significant for the culture of USC Athletics as a whole. It sends a message of acceptance that, for Heinel, is the most important part of any sports program.
