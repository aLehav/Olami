The set-up: After an offseason marked by NCAA sanctions, coaching
changes and transfers, USC coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojan football
team travelled to Hawaii looking to provide some sought-after answers
to the many questions surrounding the program.
The story: The game Thursday night in Hawaii was record-breaking in
just about every way imaginable. Whether breaking those records is a
good thing or not simply depends on what side of the ball you look at
—USC’s offense or defense.
If there were any concerns coming into Thursday’s game about whether
or not the Trojan offense would be able to regain its effectiveness
after a disappointing 2009 season, sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley
erased them completely. Leading a young squad, Barkley had a memorable
night, throwing for five touchdowns on 18-of-23 passing while racking
up 257 yards against a Hawai’i defense that seemed stretched out and
befuddled all game.
“To have [the passing game] finally go in a game like this is very
satisfying,” Barkley said. “I knew how prepared we were. From all the
work that we put in, I knew we were going to do great tonight.”
Barkley’s five-touchdown feat groups him with Rodney Peete, Carson
Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez as the only USC quarterbacks to
do so in a single game. Barkley had never thrown for more than two
touchdown passes in a game prior to Thursday, and his season touchdown
total after one game this year is already one-third of what it was in
2009.
The main recipient of those touchdown passes, senior wide receiver
Ronald Johnson, followed suit in breaking records — his three
receiving scores tied him for the most ever in a single game by a USC
player. Johnson also returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown, the
longest return since Curtis Conway’s 96-yard score in 1992.
“I was out there in the zone,” Johnson said. “Me and the guys were
talking back and forth. They kept encouraging me, and it came. It’s a
team thing and we came together as a team.”
Unfortunately for USC, the Trojan defense was notable for entirely
different reasons.
In defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin’s first opportunity to showcase
his defensive system, the widely inexperienced bunch had trouble
handling Hawaii’s pistol offense, allowing 588 yards — the most since
the 613 allowed against Oregon in 2009 — and 36 points, the most a USC
team has ever allowed against Hawai’i.
Sign of greatness: Junior tailback Marc Tyler — starting for the first
time in his career — showcased some of his ability in a spectacular
44-yard touchdown run, in which he used an early cutback to turn a
potential loss of yards into a game-breaking score.
Going for two: USC’s conversion attempts were anything but ordinary
Thursday night, as the Trojans attempted four two-point conversions —
two taken by Barkley and two taken by senior quarterback Mitch
Mustain. Perhaps the strangest element to the tactic was the use of
the swinging gate formation, in which the field goal kicking team
spread the field wide in hopes of creating a mismatch. On one
occasion, the unit reformed into a field goal formation and simply
kicked the extra point.
“When our special teams didn’t make [the first two point conversion
attempt], that put us in position to keep going for it,” Kiffin said.
“Then we thought we had some good plays lined up [for the conversion
attempt] and kept going with that for a while. When the score was a
certain number, we went back to extra points.”

HONOLULU — The win will be remembered as coach Lane Kiffin’s first victory in
charge of the USC football program.
But the night belonged to sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley.
On a steamy, muggy night in Honolulu, Barkley broke the thermometer.
He was nearly flawless in USC’s (1-0) 49-36 victory over Hawai’i
(0-1), picking apart the Hawaiian defense for 257 yards on 18-for-23
passing and equaling a school record  of five touchdowns currently
held by four other players.
“I did not [think this game was going to be high scoring],” Barkley
said. “But sometimes it turns out that way. We had to respond and I’m
proud of the way our guys played.”




Victory · USC players celebrate after scoring a touchdown in the Trojans’ 49-36 win over Hawai’i. Two players stood out Thursday night: sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and senior receiver Ronald Johnson, who finished the game with seven catches. – Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan



Barkley lost 10 pounds since the end of last season and it showed. The
sophomore quarterback was more mobile both in and out of the pocket,
throwing four touchdowns to three different receivers before halftime.
His previous career high was two touchdowns in a game.
But by far, his favorite target was senior receiver Ronald Johnson.
Barkley completed a one-yard touchdown pass to Johnson near the end of
the first quarter to extend the Trojans’ lead to 14-6, and then again
with less than three minutes left in the second quarter to seemingly
put the game out of reach at 27-16. Johnson finished with seven
catches for 59 yards and tied a school record with three receiving
touchdowns.
“It all took off during the summer,” Johnson said about his chemistry
with Barkley. “We all went out and catch. That connection kept growing
and growing and growing and it paid off today.”
Yet, Johnson’s most important score came without the assistance of Barkley.
Johnson fielded a punt at USC’s own 11-yard line early in the fourth
quarter, broke a few tackles and sprinted down the right sideline to
put the Trojans up 34-16, which put the nail in the coffin. His
89-yard return was the longest punt return since Curtis Conway
returned a punt 96 yards in 1992, although it appeared as if Johnson
might not return the punt at all with four unblocked Warriors waiting
to hit him once he caught the ball.
“For a minute I’m like, ‘Aw I think I should catch it,’ “Johnson said.
“I felt the guy coming in but I just made a full-speed decision.”
His decision paid off as he eluded the tacklers and found his way to
the end zone.
Not to be forgotten is running back Marc Tyler. The junior got his
first start of his career and didn’t disappoint. He rushed for more
than 100 yards for the first time in his career and finished with 17
carries for 154 yards and a touchdown. It was his last run, a 44-yard
zig-zag through seemingly everyone on the Warrior defense after USC
coach Lane Kiffin pulled the second-string offense to put the
first-string back in, that punctuated the night.
“I was just thinking I know I couldn’t lose yards so I cut it back and
it opened up for me,” Tyler said.
But if there’s anyone who can rain on his own parade, it’s Kiffin.
When asked about how he felt about his first victory, Kiffin replied
with the enthusiasm of Eeyore.
“Not very well because we didn’t do it in the style we want to — [we]
want to be disciplined and tough. I thought we were tough today,
thought we played physical in parts of the game but we weren’t
disciplined so that was disappointing to see,” he said. “Really hoping
to pitch a shutout turnover wise but with the backups in there turned
one over so we’re disappointed in that as well.”
Instead of dwelling on the offensive positives, Kiffin chose to point
out the defensive negatives. USC was actually outgained by Hawaii, 588
yards to 524 yards, and the Trojans committed 11 penalties for 100
yards and missed more tackles than Kiffin cared to count.
“Defensively, we didn’t play well obviously.  I’m really disappointed
with everything in general: the late hit on Jurrell, the number of
offsides on the defensive line. Part of it’s my fault on the defensive
side in the second half. I pulled guys early keeping the big picture
in mind with the long season we can’t get guys injured with limited
numbers,” Kiffin said. “We ended up winning the game which is really
good. But as you can see we got some depth concerns and issues. We
need to develop our backup guys.”
Kiffin can take solace knowing that one change he did make turned out
to be positive.
Before the game, Kiffin told Johnson to ditch his favorite black socks
for the white socks the rest of the team was wearing. Kiffin said it
was a 15-minute ordeal but Johnson grudgingly obeyed.
“I think he’ll be wearing white socks the rest of the season,” Kiffin said.
Johnson just got a new catchphrase.
It’s got to be the socks.

Broseiden,
  Your writing is wonderful.  I love you.
I’m sure Coach Kiffin knows defense is somthing to work on for future games.  We also dodged a penalty call on the head shot taken by defense against Hawaii’s QB.
*D-Fense…..hmmm….guess we will have to work on that?
