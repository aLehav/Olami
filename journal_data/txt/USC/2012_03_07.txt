The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission reiterated its commitment to transparent ongoing renegotiations of the venue’s master lease at its regular monthly meeting on Wednesday.
Assistant County Counsel Thomas Faughnan, a member of the nine-member commission, responded to a Los Angeles Times report that highlighted the closed-door nature of some of the more important discussions concerning the potential transfer of control of the Coliseum and other Exposition Park venues close to USC.

“The intention of [the closed-door sessions] is to provide a level playing field for all the entities involved in the negotiation,” Faughnan said. “Each closed session has been properly described in the next month’s agenda.”
USC and the Coliseum Commission have been in talks to renegotiate the terms of the master lease on the Coliseum since 2008, when the two parties agreed to a 25-year extendable lease that allowed USC football to continue to play in the venue. The commission is comprised of city, county and state officials.
The commission released a list of modifications to the lease in January, which have been made available to the public on the commission’s website, but the proposal has yet to be voted on by the commission itself.
If the modified term sheet were adapted, USC would gain exclusive rights to the Coliseum, the Sports Arena and other Exposition Park facilities. The university would also be required to complete renovations on the Coliseum by the end of 2021.
Though the reaction to the proposed terms has generally been positive, many present on Wednesday asked the commission to consider other options in the transfer of the Coliseum’s master lease.
U.S. Capital, LLC Executive Vice President Linda Paul once again called upon the commission to consider the San Diego-based sports and entertainment company’s proposal to manage the Coliseum in conjunction with other equity partners.

Crimes against a person
At 1:35 A.m. on March 7, DPS officers responded to a non-USC female who reported that her boyfriend, a USC student, hit her in the head during an argument at 37th Place and Raymond Avenue. The non-USC female had visible bruising to her forehead and scratches on her forearm and she stated that she briefly lost consciousness after being struck. The student was detained by the officers, and he was subsequently arrested by LAPD officers who responded to the scene to take over the investigation.
Crimes against property
at 11:38 a.m. on March 6, a suspect used an unknown object to crack both passenger side windows of a non-USC female’s vehicle at 2706 Menlo Ave.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:19 A.M. on March 7, DPS officers on routine patrol near the Delta Gamma sorority observed a student bleeding from a cut to his finger, and when they contacted him they found him to be intoxicated and evasive when questioned about how he sustained the injury. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #810 responded. The RA Unit treated the student then transported him to California Hospital for additional medical treatment.
At 9:35 P.M. on March 6, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect refusing to pay for parking in the garage at the location and upon their arrival the property manager advised them that he would not allow the subject to exit without receiving payment. The suspect eventually agreed to comply and the officers cleared the scene without further incident.
At 9:05 P.M on March 6, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a cut to his forehead when he fell while performing a skateboard stunt in a first floor hallway at Pardee Tower. The officers examined the student then transported him to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
At 2:24 P.M. on March 6, a student’s unoccupied vehicle rolled out of a parking stall, down a ramp and into a wall inside Parking Structure 1. There was minor damage to the vehicle.
At 2:05 P.M. on March 6, DPS officers responded to a staff member who sustained burns to her hand when she spilled hot soup on it. The staff member was in a restroom running cold water over her hand when the officers arrived and she subsequently transported herself to the Student Health Center for medical treatment.
At 11:20 A.M. on March 6, DPS officers responded to a staff member who injured his head, neck and back when he tripped and fell down a flight of stairs at Ronald Tutor Hall of Engineering. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #15 responded. The RA Unit examined the staff member then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.
I wouldn’t be so sure he was not she in front of DG.  They have gone downhill for the last several years.

Priya Jaikumar, an associate professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, discussed how her personal experiences affected her ideas on film and education as part of the What Matters to Me and Why lecture series Wednesday at the Ground Zero Performance Café.
Like the movies · Priya Jaikumar, an associate professor in the School of Cinematic Arts, says film allows her to understand the world from the perspectives of other people. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Jaikumar worked as a journalist in India when the opportunity arose for her to study abroad in the United States in 1991. She said her decision to come to the United States embodied a conflict particular to Indian women of her generation and social situation.
“My life was at a crossroads, and I didn’t know how significant my decision would be,” Jaikumar said. “It was a choice between a settled personal life [in India] and a complete unknown entity. My dilemma was very specific to the 20th century as it was something I faced as an educated woman. It was a particular privilege, a precarious privilege.”
She said this privilege ultimately affected her values and beliefs as she realized the opportunities afforded to her because of her education.
“What I particularly value is to make such instances of mobility and opportunity available to more people,” Jaikumar said. “A majority of humanity does not have this. We do not have the privilege or choice of following our hearts.”
Jaikumar also addressed how film allows her to make an impact on education because it expresses and communicates new worlds.
“Using my classes as a platform to bring [film] forward and open up a range of sensibilities for my audiences is very important to me,” Jaikumar said. “Part of education is walking a mile in someone else’s shoes and opening up your sympathies. Film allows you to see in other perspectives and alter your perception of the world.”
Jaikumar said she joined the critical studies department because it combines two of the most influential forces in her life: the creative impulse to make tangible contributions to the world and the critical impulse to think about the connections between the world we create and the world we inhabit.
“I believe the best creativity in the sciences and in the arts are born only when there is support of the critical impulse,” Jaikumar said. “This is why I’m in the department of critical studies.”
Jaikumar said her decision to study abroad still affects her values to this day.
“In my lifetime, I had a choice,” Jaikumar said. “I left my family behind, and I’m here, so my students and colleagues are important to me. My life I have made here is important with my husband and my child.”
Jaikumar, who serves as a residential faculty adviser to Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College, is working on a book about places that become visual icons entitled Where Histories Reside: Filming India as Location. She plans to continue to write, engage with other people and retain her curiosity and sense of wonder.
“Those who remain open and curious can transcend the linearity and fatality of time,” Jaikumar said. “That is what I’m invested in and, independent of film, that is what I dedicate my life to.”
Inspiring role model for faculty and students

One candidate for Dean of Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences accepted a different position and withdrew from consideration, Executive Vice Provost Michael Quick said in an email on Wednesday.
Lauren Benton, New York University dean of the humanities, told Quick she accepted a position elsewhere. Benton, a professor of history, is the recipient of the World History Association Book Prize in 2003.
Three other candidates are still being considered for the position, which oversees the largest school within the university. They each already have or will come to campus for two days, during which forums allow students, faculty and staff to meet the candidates. The candidates also meet with senior administrators during the visits.
Steve Kay, dean of the division of biological sciences at UC San Diego, visited campus on Feb. 29 to meet with students and faculty in order to discuss his vision for the school.
Peter Bearman, professor of social sciences at Columbia University, is scheduled to visit March 21 and 22, and Harry Atwater, a professor of applied physics and material science at the California Institute of Technology, is scheduled to visit March 26 and 27.
Dornsife comprises 33 academic departments and 31 research institutions and centers. The dean also oversees faculty recruitment, fundraising and the expansion of research opportunities for students and faculty.
The original four candidates were announced Feb. 21 in a memo from Provost Elizabeth Garrett.
“Since the beginning of this academic year, the search advisory committee has conducted an exhaustive and thorough search,” Garrett said in the memo. “The quality of the overall pool of candidates is excellent.”
We’re better off without her. If she’s associated with NYU, chances are she’s scum. They care not for their students, the neighborhood from which they benefit nor anything else except profit.

USC’s Program Board announced EdMonth, an initiative aimed at getting students to discuss the state of education in America, on Wednesday. Several assemblies will host EdMonth events during the last two weeks of March.
The initiative will also focus on the school systems in Los Angeles and across the nation, said Black Student Assembly President Eric Burse, who organized much of the effort.

“We’re going to have events that are cross-cultural,” Burse said. “These events are going to be student-centered and student-focused and the discussions are going to be student-led.”
All Program Board assemblies will contribute to the program.
“It’s very rare that we have more than four or five assemblies come together to work on something,” Burse said. “We have a really dedicated team in Program Board so we can delegate tasks and come out with a big production at the end. We haven’t done an event of this size before.”
Based on NBC’s Education Nation, EdMonth will incorporate representatives and leaders from public platforms — including local high schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District and the government — to spark the conversation at USC, Burse said.
“We’re trying to bring people who students will be interested in hearing and who will also encourage [students] to change something or get involved in education,” Burse said.
For the opening day events on March 19, Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education President Monica Garcia and Teach for America CEO Wendy Kopp will speak to students about how college students can help to ameliorate education inequality.
London Moore, Teach For America’s manager of campus recruitment for USC and UC Irvine, said that more than 100 USC students received offers to join Teach For America last year.
“USC is consistently in the top five for schools accepted,” Moore said. “USC is a really unique university in that it does take that [focus on education], and a lot of that focus is encouraged by the faculty and then the students.”
Joanna Smith, an assistant professor at the Rossier School of Education and expert on charter schools and school choice, said quality teachers are one of the most instrumental elements in improving education.
“Schools serving a high percentage of low-income students often have trouble attracting high-quality teachers, the factor that research has shown is the single most important component in success,” Smith said.
Asian Pacific American Students Assembly Director Amy Huang said Program Board hopes to increase student activism on campus through the creation of the event.
“We should be doing our part to educate USC students about the state of education,” Huang said. “I hope we not only increase the level of awareness of the state of education in this country but also generate some activism.”
Burse said one of EdMonth’s main goals is to make the discussion on education viral.
“Students are leaders in a lot of different issues in our nation, and this is one of the issues that students can be a leader in — whether it’s coming out with new technology for the classroom, or whether it’s becoming a teacher for Teach For America,” Burse said. “There’s tons of ways students can get involved to help the state of education in America.”
Burse said that other universities will be involved in the EdMonth discussion and that he hopes the intiative will spread to other campuses across the country. Program Board plans to use various social media platforms to attract and involve participants from across the United States.
“We definitely want the initiative to be successful at USC, but even more, we want it to happen at schools across the nation,” Burse said. “This is a conversation that could be had at any school in any state in any city or any economic level.”
Wow…quoting a professor whose an “expert” on charter schools and brining on TFA CEO….don’t look now but USC is looking neoliberal on the education discussion. If they really wanted to see why education is so messed up than they need to look at the root at why inner city schools and schools where its predominantly (low income) POC students have such disenfranchised conditions.  Looking at TFA and charter school models will not help the current model and its a shame that USC is relying so much on TFA since they have been known in acts of union-busting. 
May I suggest that instead USC look at the SES inequality of families and how THAT affects a students’ performance in school or even how an area where a school is located has 40% of people living below poverty line. I bet you anything that during this “EdMonth” discussion – the subject of LAUSD eliminating Pre-K education and Adult schools will not be brought up once because again – that’s now where the money and fame are….
 Why many of these inner city schools, own TFA teachers do their 2 years of duty and then leave so they can get on with their lives. I swear I sometimes feel USC students only like this TFA, City Year, and other NGO involvement just so it looks nice on their resume and then they can go on becoming some greedy corporate house slave or some pious law student. Prove me wrong, but I don’t see it happening.

The USC Thornton School of Music and the L.A. Philharmonic, in conjunction with The Colburn School and the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, plan to hold the first-ever Piatigorsky International Cello Festival March 9 through March 18.
The festival will bring musicians from all over the world to celebrate renowned cellist Gregor Piatigorsky, who was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2011. The Piatigorsky Festival will feature events at the University Park Campus, the Walt Disney Concert Hall and The Colburn School, a conservatory located across the street from the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Ralph Kirshbaum, the Gregor Piatigorsky Endowed Chair in Violoncello and artistic director of the festival, said the festival was created to give both artists and non-musicians a chance to explore the limits of the cello world in one expansive event.
Though USC previously held a Piatigorsky seminar for 20 years, Kirshbaum said he saw potential to share the art of cello to a greater audience.
“I went to the [Thornton] dean and I said, ‘You know, this seminar has been a fine thing … but I think we can do something with a greater outreach and a greater impact, not just here in Los Angeles, not just regionally and not even just nationally, but internationally,’” Kirshbaum said.
The festival, which took two years to plan, kicks off with a sold-out concert at Bovard Auditorium on Friday that will feature seven distinguished soloists, backed by an orchestra of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra members and some of USC’s own accomplished musicians.
Other highlights of the festival include master classes, which are open to the public, and a closing concert that will bring together more than 100 musicians from Los Angeles schools and orchestras as well as visiting artists.
The festival was planned to highlight USC, The Colburn School and the Walt Disney Concert Hall without overwhelming the logistics of festival attendees, Kirshbaum said. Each day of the event is centered either at the University Park Campus or in Downtown. USC is scheduled to host events throughout the day on Friday, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday and the following Friday.
Sunny Yang, a graduate student studying cello performance who will perform in the opening concert, said the festival offers a unique opportunity.
“This festival also brings the city’s music community together, which doesn’t happen very often,” Yang said. “It’s wonderful.”
Kirshbaum said the Piatigorsky Festival is more than just a collaboration for cellists and musicians. Though the percentage of USC students who actively enjoy classical music might be low, Kirshbaum said the quality of music and of the artists in the festival could be a revelation to those who take the time to attend the event.
“The student years are a time for experimentation and the question is, ‘How open are these student minds? Are they willing to go and listen to something they haven’t before?’” Kirshbaum said. “What this festival offers is the opportunity to hear the performance of a classical instrument at the highest imaginable level — these artists are all masters.”
Kirshbaum said he expects all the performances to impress attendees.
“Any event that a student decided to go to, to take the opportunity given to them in this city, would be very exciting,” he said. “I think it would blow them away.”
If you can’t make it to campus, you can listen to the opening concert streaming on KUSC’s website Friday evening.

At this point in the season, it’s all about who has the hot hand.
This unofficial law of March basketball bodes well for the Women of Troy. Currently riding a season-high six-game win streak, USC is liking its chances to make a deep run in this year’s Pac-12 tournament.
“Everything is starting to click for us,” senior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “It’s all about putting it all together as one team, and hopefully we can keep that going.”
Hitting their stride · Junior forward Christina Marinacci is averaging 8.8 points this season for (18-11) USC. The team has won six straight contests. - Chris Pham| Daily Trojan
Though that sort of confidence is invaluable at any point in the season, it is almost a necessity during postseason play.
One bad night and the Women of Troy know that their season could be over.
“Our tournament started a few weeks ago,” Gilbreath said, alluding to the team’s mentality following a loss to Stanford that preceded its current win streak. “Right now, we’re trying to go win a championship, and we can’t afford to lose any games.”
Thanks to its current streak, USC shot up the Pac-12 standings during the final month of the regular season. After the loss to Stanford dropped their conference record to 6-6, the Women of Troy caught fire thanks to contributions from numerous players, including junior forward Christina Marinacci, who is coming off a stellar performance this past weekend against the Washington schools. She was rewarded by being named Pac-12 Player of the Week.
“You can really tell that [the team is playing well] by the way we practice,” Marinacci said. “Hopefully we’ll carry it into the next game, whether we get Oregon State or Washington State.”
USC’s ascent to the top of the standings was rewarded with a first round bye, but the team hopes that the extra day’s rest does not affect its game.
“For us, we need to just focus on what we’re doing,” Marinacci said. “I don’t think any other team can beat us, but we can definitely beat ourselves.”
The key to USC’s success during its run has been defense. The Women of Troy have held opponents to under 60 points in four of the last five games.
The Women of Troy will play Washington State, a team that finished 11th in the conference and won just five league games, entered the Pac-12 tournament having lost eight of its past nine games. The most recent of those losses was to USC on March 3.
Tipoff for Thursday’s game is scheduled for 7:15 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Garrett Stubbs recalls the experience with the slightest smile.
Trojan baseball’s freshman catcher sensation had just heard his name announced over the public address system at Dedeaux Field at the start of the Trojans’ fourth game of the season. On opening night a week before, Stubbs also hit leadoff, had his name called first during lineup announcements and ran out to the foul line, as is customary on opening night. His other teammates in the starting lineup joined him as their names were announced.
On this particular Friday night one week later, Stubbs was again hitting leadoff. The Trojans do not usually run out to the line when their name is announced during pregame and had not in three games since opening night.
Informed by his teammates, however, that all starters ran out to the foul line when their name was announced on Fridays, Stubbs trotted out of the dugout when his name was heard.
Recalls Stubbs, “[My teammates] were all like, ‘Gotcha freshman. We don’t do that kind of stuff.’ So I was kind of put back in my place as a freshman.”
It would be more than understandable for Stubbs to not feel or act like a freshman. In his first four games as a Trojan, Stubbs went 7-16 (.438 average). Toss in three walks on top of that and that’s a .526 on base percentage.
Stubbs and fellow freshman Stephen Tarpley (pitcher) and Dante Flores (second baseman) have been integral parts of the Trojans’ success at the start of the season. The Trojans opened 7-0, their best start since 1988. They then dropped three straight, but have since won back-to-back games to put their record at 9-3.
Tarpley has started all three of the Trojans’ Sunday series finales, and picked up his first career win March 4 against No. 6 North Carolina, going six strong innings, allowing just two runs on four hits, with eight strikeouts to his two walks.
“Tarpley has done really [well]  for us,” said USC coach Frank Cruz following Tarpley’s win on Sunday. “For a freshman to show like that is really great.”
In his young Trojan career, Tarpley has amassed a 3.45 ERA more than 15 2/3 innings pitched, with an incredible 24 strikeouts in those limited innings.
Flores has not had the chance to contribute as much as Stubbs and Tarpley, usually forced out of the lineup by more established and experienced players at his position. Yet he cannot be kept on the bench all the time, because when he is in the game he produces. He has just four hits and one walk on the season, but two of those hits were triples, and he has scored three of the five times he has reached base.
“It’s been so much fun,” said Flores of the start of his career so far. “This whole atmosphere has just been awesome to be around.”
But Stubbs is the “Golden Boy” of the three. And as impressive as his raw numbers have been, Stubbs’ intangibles are really what sets him apart. So far this season, he has played left field, centerfield and catcher and was in fact recruited as a middle infielder, providing valuable versatility.
Even less tangible is Stubbs’ natural ability to make plays. He has covered the outfield gracefully. He has yet to make an error despite having never played there before arriving at USC.
At the plate, he is adept at advancing the runner and putting the ball in play. He did not strike out for his first 20 at-bats of the year and has just four strike-outs in 44 total at-bats.
In the Trojans’ victory over Jacksonville University earlier this season, Stubbs went 0-4, but recorded two RBIs by simply putting the ball in play, twice hitting groundouts up the middle with a runner on third.
“All of us have come together, all of us have been able to contribute and it’s just been great to be a part of,” Stubbs said of his class’ contribution to the season so far. “We’ve gelled together really well as a unit, too. We’re all going to live together next year.”
That’s when they won’t be freshmen. For now, they still are. Even if they don’t play that way.

Wednesday afternoon, dozens of NFL scouts were on campus to watch former Trojans work out in an effort to raise their positions in April’s draft. It’s really the last chance for these athletes to make an impression on the scouts and millions of dollars are at stake. However, I don’t buy it.
Though it’s important for teams to know a player’s measurables, such as their height, weight and speed, scouts are looking too deep into the numbers. If a player can play, he can play and no number quantifies a player’s heart and desire to be the best.
Beyond numbers · Though players such as redshirt junior defensive end Nick Perry are tested on measurables, they should be examined for their play. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Sure, a player can skyrocket in the draft if he runs particularly well or if his bench press is extraordinary, but not every star has had great measurables. Jerry Rice, arguably the best receiver in history, ran a less-than-stellar 40-time at around 4.70. Anquan Boldin, who has been among the league’s most consistent receivers since he entered the League in 2001, ran a 4.75, slower than many defensive ends. They turned out OK, didn’t they?
But perhaps you are a firm believer in numbers and believe that no matter how good your mental attributes are, you still need to have strong physical ones to complement.
Well, why does the NFL hold an entire combine and insist on schools holding pro days as well? If the point of the combine is to measure the measurables, what is the point of a pro day? Especially when the pro day is just two weeks after the combine.
People train months for the combine (which really doesn’t have that much to do with football, anyway). Is a player going to be that much better in a workout two weeks later? And if he does perform better, wouldn’t you be skeptical, especially if the results were significantly better than they were before?
But more importantly: Does one become a better football player in that short time frame between the combine and the pro day? Many players decide not to workout in positional drills while at the combine, saying that they want to work with players they are familiar with on their home turf.
But at the next level, quarterbacks aren’t going to have the luxury of throwing to “their guys” on “their field.” Their rosters will constantly change, players will get released and they will be throwing to different players frequently.
Linemen, you are not going to have the same coaches you had in college telling you what drills to run. There will be no scripting — it will be about learning on the fly.
Robert Griffin III for instance, the star quarterback from Baylor University, decided not to throw at the combine because he wanted to be with his receivers.
What are we possibly going to learn about him when he throws to receivers he has been throwing to in practice for nearly five years in a set of drills that have been specifically designed for him to look good?
What did scouts likely learn about star USC tackle Matt Kalil at pro day? He probably looked athletic and ran good times considering his size. But did anyone really learn about him as a football player? I doubt it.
The combine does not measure a prospect as a football player. For the most part it measures athleticism, which is important, but it is by no means the end all, be all.
For me, pro day is overkill. It’s scripted. It’s performed by the coaches of the player’s alma mater. It is done in almost too comfortable of an environment. And it happens right after the combine; does the player in question really become a better NFL prospect in 13 days? If scouts think so, maybe they should take another look.
A great athlete is an asset for an NFL team and will always be envied, but I will take a great football player over a great athlete any day. If the player happens to be both? Well, I guess you hit the jackpot.
I will always take a player’s tape more seriously than a 40-yard dash time. I will always take a player’s heart more seriously than his vertical jump.
Football is not won with numbers, as everyone in the NFL is talented; it is won with what players possess mentally, emotionally and in their hearts. Nothing at a combine or a pro day can quantify that.

“People train months for the combine (which really doesn’t have that much to do with football, anyway).”
-Uhhh, that’s like you saying, “I’ll study my butt off for the SATs, get a really high score, and when I attend college, I won’t use all those big vocabulary words, the subjects section, the math (because I’m not pursuing an engineering field)” etc….Wrong. The combine tests one’s speed, agility, the ability to contort your body in certain situations, your jumping max, etc. It’s just like Daniel san in “Karate Kid” in how he questioned Mr. Miyagi as to why he had to wax on and wax off, thinking it had nothing to do with karate.

The Pac-12 tournament contest between USC and UCLA carried a distinctly familiar feel for the Trojans.
Holding a 19-13 lead in the waning moments of the first half, freshman guard Byron Wesley drilled a 15-footer to give No. 12-seeded USC a 21-13 lead with about four minutes left to play.
End of the line · The season ended promptly for junior center James Blasczyk and the Trojans on Wednesday after a 55-40 loss at the the hands of the Bruins. The Trojans finish the season at 6-26. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
But things once again spiraled out of control for the USC men’s basketball team (6-26, 1-17).
The Bruins (19-13, 11-7) would promptly close the half with nine straight points as part of a 26-4 run that spanned nearly 10 minutes over two halves, ending the Trojans’ nightmarish season 55-40 in front of an announced crowd of 5,973 at the Staples Center. It also marked the third time this season that USC has fallen to its crosstown rival. The team’s 26th loss of the season was the most in program history.
“The way the [first] half ended set us up for failure in the second half and put us in a position where they had the momentum,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “They kind of just wore us down on the boards. Their size got us.”
UCLA will advance to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament and face Arizona on Thursday at 2:40 p.m.
For parts of the game, O’Neill’s young bunch had chances. They led 5-4 in the early goings. They led 8-7 about halfway through the opening period. They also led by as much as eight points.
But again, they hit a wall and were outscored by 14 points in the final 20 minutes.
“We came out strong,” Wesley said. “We had a lot of energy the first half. We had a lot of momentum. [In the] second half, we had the same game plan — [we] wanted to come out strong, but things just didn’t pan out.”
The Trojans were outrebounded 42-33 over the course of the game, and had trouble dealing with center Joshua Smith, who played eight minutes in the second half and registered five points after he was benched for the first 20 minutes because of a violation of team rules.
With Smith sidelined for the first half, the Trojans fared relatively well — at least on defense.
The Bruins shot just 23 percent from the field, making seven field goal attempts compared to the Trojans’ eight. Over the first 10 minutes, they were 3-for-20 from the field.
In the second half, by comparison, they finally found their stroke, making 46 percent of their field goal attempts.
“We wanted them to shoot jump shots,” O’Neill said. “To be honest with you, none of our bigs can really match up with them man-for-man across the front line.”
The USC roster features just one healthy player taller than 6-foot-7 in junior center James Blasczyk, whereas UCLA boasts five players 6-foot-9 or taller in Smith, center Anthony Stover and forwards Brendan Lane, David and Travis Wear.
To make matters more difficult, the Trojans, who were already undersized, struggled shooting-wise from the perimeter, converting less than 30 percent of their shots.
And just two players, Wesley, who finished with 13 points, and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson, who had 11, finished in double-figures.
The starting backcourt of sophomore Maurice Jones and senior Eric Strangis was largely ineffective offensively, combining for 12 points on 3-of-12 shooting.
“Unfortunately, we didn’t do enough on the offensive end to win it,” O’Neill said.
After setting a program record for most losses in a single season, the Trojans appeared relieved — at least to some degree — to conclude one of the more disappointing seasons in recent memory.
By season’s end, just six scholarship players were available as a result of numerous injuries — five players had been sidelined for most if not all of the season, in addition to lost recruiting classes as the result of sanctions.
“We do have a bad taste in our mouth,” Jackson said. “We don’t like losing. Things would have been a lot different if we were full force and didn’t have as many injuries, so I’m definitely looking forward to playing with everybody at full health.”
O’Neill also expressed frustration after the Trojans dropped 18 of their 19 games to conclude the year.
“We became irrelevant as losses mounted,” he said. “That’s not something we want to be as a program ever again.”

Tucked away in a Tokyo subway station lies an unassuming, 10-seat sushi bar. It has neither menu nor bathroom and serves only the simplest of dishes, yet patrons must make reservations at least a month in advance. Meals cost 30,000 yen (around $375) and on most nights, are served by and eaten under the stark gaze of Jiro Ono, the restaurant’s 85-year-old owner and most likely the world’s greatest sushi chef.
Sushi sensei · Jiro Ono has been dubbed one of the greatest sushi chefs of our time. His restaurant received an impressive three Michelin stars. - Photo courtesy of Sunshine Sachs
A man whose passion for his work has brought him to the top of his profession, Ono’s story is the subject of filmmaker and USC alumus David Gelb’s new documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi. The movie’s title is no exaggeration: As a young man, Jiro dreamed of ways to improve the art of making sushi, and this film is a tribute to what he’s been able to achieve by pursuing those dreams.
And yes, sushi-making is an art, something that would be very difficult to deny after witnessing the care that those working at Jiro’s restaurant put into each and every dish, as well as the reactions they earn from their highly devoted clientele. In the culinary world, Jiro is the apex toward which many look for inspiration and yet his methods are exceedingly simple. All that separates Jiro from his contemporaries is that he truly strives for perfection in every aspect of his business.
As an exploration of Jiro’s philosophy, this film most definitely succeeds. He doesn’t serve anything out of the ordinary, but merely takes the most basic ingredients and prepares them with an eye toward the flawless. Keeping the restaurant and the menu equally slim is how Jiro goes about fully realizing a perfectionism that allows him to function. One gets the sense that each day of his life is almost exactly like any other; were he unable to make sushi, he might simply cease to function.
Jiro has been sharpening his talents for more than 60 years, but only recently has the world started to take notice.
When Michelin, France’s revered food guide, visited Tokyo, the guide awarded the restaurant its highest honor — a three-star rating. Not a single establishment in all of Los Angeles can claim the same feat. Jiro has remained exceedingly humble despite the accolades and believes his technique is still a work in progress. Never is he depicted as boastful.
Appropriately enough, if there’s one thing the film manages to communicate, it’s that this isn’t a one-man show. Each chef working under Jiro went through a grueling apprenticeship that most apprentices drop out of long before becoming worthy of preparing the egg sushi — a test that usually requires hundreds of failures before finally meeting Jiro’s standards.
None have worked harder than Jiro’s sons, who in the Japanese tradition, have followed in their father’s footsteps. The younger son has his own restaurant: a perfect mirror image of Jiro’s that serves the same food, which, despite having an indistinguishable taste, is cheaper because it doesn’t have all of Jiro’s prestige attached.
Jiro’s eldest son, Yoshikazu, will have an even harder time stepping out of his father’s shadow considering that it will be his duty to take over the main restaurant once Jiro finally retires.
Though Yoshikazu is undeniably as good a chef as his father, it won’t be easy for him to craft his own identity. The question of the legacy passing from father to son reveals itself as the human relationship at the heart of the story.
This is a beautiful film, shot entirely on the game-changing Red One camera that allowed Gelb to capture all of the footage with no one but the translator onsite to assist.
The result is an intimate, yet crystal clear picture, that properly highlights the food and craftsmanship on display in a way that wouldn’t have been possible just a few years ago. The clearest payoff is a standout sequence comparing a full sushi meal to a musical performance in which we truly witness the care and artistry put into what most think of as a simple food. Here, that very same food is transformed into somwething stunning.
This documentary manages to be effective by approaching its subject the same way its subject approaches life: Pick a specific thing and do it justice. Masterfully crafted, Jiro Dreams of Sushi will leave audiences enraptured and mouths watering.

Casey Veggies
Saturday, March 10, 7:30 p.m.
Roxy Theatre
Though there are plenty of talented young hip-hop artists around, Casey Veggies is one to keep an eye on.
Originally a member of the now-notorious Odd Future rap collective, the 18-year-old rapper decided to stick to his academic studies and parted ways with the group.
Now he’s finally diving headfirst into his music career. There’s been plenty of buzz about Casey Veggies, largely because of the slick mixtapes he’s been dropping since 2007 as well as his 2011 debut LP Sleeping in Class. With a smart, even-keeled flow and intriguing collaborations with everyone from OFWGKTA’s Tyler the Creator to Mac Miller, Veggies looks to blow up any day now.
He’s headlining the Roxy Theatre on Saturday and will be joined by Street Drum Corps and Nico Vega. If the hype’s true, it’s going to be a show worth watching.
 
Capsize
Thursday, March 8-April 15
Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions
There’s theater, then there’s art and then there’s performance art.
In celebration of this hybrid of the arts is Capsize, a new collaborative installation and performance by Tad Beck and Jennifer Locke, curated by Marjorie Vecchio.
The contemporary exhibition features photographs that incorporate objects, landscape and models off the coast of Maine to explore Locke’s ideas on action and movement.
Both artists share a common interest in voyeurism and looking upon the body. Beck takes a particular interest in eroticism, masculinity and absurdity, while Locke is concerned with the ways in which forms inhabit space.
In either case, Beck and Locke explore the human form and the societal perceptions surrounding this physicality.
An opening reception will be held today at LACE from 8 to 10 p.m.
Be sure to check out Capsize to see the different ways in which the body is viewed firsthand.
 
Human Behavior 2: The Exodus
Friday, March 9, 7 p.m.
The Lab at Hollywood Improv
Dealing with midterms can be, in a word, stressful; unwind this weekend with a little offbeat fun from the hilarious comedy trio, Awkward Kids. The group is composed of three women — Dana Pacheco, Michelle Glavan and Christiann Castellanos — who all sport diverse backgrounds, including stints with the Upright Citizens Brigade and roles on shows like Comedy Central’s hilarious slacker comedy, Workaholics.
The show features some colorful segments, such as “Forest B-tches,” a gangsta-rap take on fairy tales, as well as a humorous look at the “Coupon Fairy.”
Considering that the last Awkward Kids show sold out, it’s probably wise to get tickets soon.  With the online promo code — see AwkwardKids.com — tickets are only $5 and The Lab at Hollywood Improv also sports a full drink and food menu for your enjoyment.
 
6th Annual St. Patrick’s Day Festival
Saturday, March 17, 10 a.m.-3:30 p.m.
Orange County Marketplace
Bust out the corned beef, cabbage and, of course, Irish coffee; it’s that time of the year again.
The Orange County Marketplace welcomes its 6th Annual Saint Patrick’s Day Festival: a celebration with Irish dance, Celtic music and a giant leprechaun — seriously.
More than 100 world champion Irish dancers will perform throughout the day, including companies such as the Claddagh School of Irish Dance and the Butler Fearon O’Connor School of Irish Dance.
Additionally, electric cellist Marston Smith will play his uniquely designed six string cello. Irish comedy and magic with Abbit the Average Leprechaun will be available all day long.
Did we mention there will be green beer, green ice cream and green lemonade? There seems to be a theme here.
Admission is $2 and the event is held in conjunction with the O.C. Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa weekend swap meet, which features hundreds of vendors.
Let’s be real: The Irish know how to party.

Superheroes and comic books: The two are almost inseparable.
There are more to comic books than superheroes, and those series and genres should definitely be looked at, but when it comes to the big companies and what many creators turn to, it’s superheroes. They’re the flagship titles and bulk of the Big Two, Marvel and DC, as well as others. Moreover, the one comic book that made it onto Time magazine’s list of the 100 greatest novels was Watchmen, a superhero comic.
Superheroes are so prevalent in comic books today because the basic two ideas — the concept and the medium — launched each other. In the late 1930s comic books had been around, but they were either collected reprints of newspaper strips like The Phantom or full-length, illustrated detective stories. Meanwhile, in pulp magazines, proto-superheroes had appeared, including The Shadow, Doc Savage, Operator #5 and The Spider.
But in June 1938, everything changed when Action Comics #1 debuted, featuring a man whose strength and abilities went beyond that of a normal person. This man was Superman. With a vibrant costume and sensational story elements, Action Comics was a hit and in the next decade, dozens, if not hundreds, of new superheroes were created in a booming comic book industry.
Other media followed suit. Today, many big-budget movies tend to be about superheroes — and with The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, this summer will be big in superhero films — and they’ve been adapted to television as well. Heroes like the Lone Ranger or the Green Hornet started out on the radio, not in comic books.
So then, what makes comic books so perfect for the superhero genre?
In a way, it’s the fact that they’re comics. They’re visual, but adaptive. Some mediums like television only allow for one style, but in comics, the style depends on the artist and the tone of the story. The limits of fights, settings, action sequences and characters are only what the writer and artist can think up.
The art adds mood and conveys the story. Captain America, for instance, gets bright colors and patriotic imagery, helping to develop the iconic look as a character, while a Batman story will be dark and Gothic.
Comics are also serial. The superhero works as a concept because it’s a modern epic. By being serial, it gives the hero a timeless feeling, with the idea that the good fight is never over. With good writing there’s room to grow, but the character’s strengths never fail. Many attempts to export superheroes to other mediums get bogged down by trying to cram dozens of ideas into short time frames or never being able to create iconic takes on their characters — something that doomed the television show Heroes.
Superheroes emerged in a dark time. At the end of the 1930s, the world was marching toward war and crime was rampant in the United States and elsewhere. Superheroes served as a symbol that good could prevail over evil. In dark times, there are still heroes. That’s why many of these heroes have continued to be published since the 1940s. That’s why they lasted through the censorship of the 1950s and the social upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s.
It’s why after the turn of the century they began hitting the big screen. In an age of war, terrorism and divisiveness, people need heroes more than ever. And with only a few superhero movies a year, comic books offer weekly doses of heroism and idealism.
And with hundreds of creative teams on dozens of titles, there’s room in the industry to explore and play with the aspects of a hero. There can be brooding avengers or inspiring people of action. There can be deconstructions à la Watchmen or celebrations of the joy of superheroes like Astro City.
Superheroes aren’t just people in tights. They’re an idea, adaptable to every genre from crime to science-fiction; they offer inspiration and thrills. And thanks to their parent medium, comic books, they can have their stories told in an infinite number of ways.
Comics are about more than just superheroes, but it is with the superhero that the comic book shows its full potential as a canvas for storytelling.

“Casual dining”: It’s not easy to do well as a restaurant, even if the term sounds like it.
Los Angeles has always been a haven of casual dining; there’s simply something about the West Coast that has encouraged the growth of comfortable places to eat that serve great food without pretension.
Maybe that explains the booming success of places like Downtown’s Bottega Louie or restauranteur Michael Cardenas’ Lazy Ox Canteen. Rolling up your sleeves and eating great food for less than $20 can be a delightfully subversive, surprising experience.
[Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Michael Cardenas as the chef of Lazy Ox Canteen. He owns and manages the restaurant. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.]
Mod · Unlike many of the dishes on the menu, such as the Tandoori Chicken Club and A Cuban Marries a Madame, The French (Onion Short Rib) Dip (above) sticks to the original recipe and shines as a true classic. - Photo courtesy of Blue Cow Kitchen and Bar
And maybe this is what makes Blue Cow Kitchen and Bar — from the minds behind the ever-popular Mendocino Farms sandwich brand — so enjoyable. There are plenty of places to eat quality, well-executed meals in the city, yet few places seem to do it as effortlessly, and as attractively, as Blue Cow does.
That said, finding the restaurant can be anything but effortless. Tucked away down a smattering of steps at the courtyard at Two California Plaza, the restaurant isn’t visible from the roadway. The parking isn’t particularly convenient — or cheap.
But find it, and Blue Cow makes a good impression right away.
There’s some nice outdoor seating, which could be a great choice on a mild spring afternoon. More significantly, there’s Blue Cow’s interior, which looks like your really rich, classy friend’s awesome basement: There are leather couches, intimate booths and relaxed seating at wooden tables, all set off by grand cave-like arches and a gleaming open kitchen.
The lighting is just right: warm and flattering without being gotta-squint dark like so many “trendy” places are. Ditto the noise level: It’s not quiet enough to feel stuffy, but it’s also certainly not the deafening tidal wave of sound that you’ll find at a place like Bottega Louie. These details don’t define a restaurant, of course, but small touches can add much to the dining experience.
And thankfully, this dining experience doesn’t disappoint. It’s clear that Executive Chef Joshua Smith shows an innate understanding of how to take fresh, local ingredients and present them in clever ways while still maintaining a sense of elegant simplicity. It falls entirely in line with the restaurant’s unpretentious yet upscale feel.
The Roasted Beets & Not Burrata, for example, is cheeky in name and brilliant in execution: The luscious texture of burrata — a cream-filled version of mozzarella — is imitated with a buttery, light mousse of regular mozzarella. The sliced roasted beets are perfect in their sweet, tender earthiness, and a rustic pistachio pesto plays perfectly with a drizzle of glossy, tangy balsamic vinegar.
It is, in a word, a home run — the kind of salad you would get on campus every day, if it were offered.
The BBQ’d Brassicas show off more of Smith’s imagination as well as a bit of theatricality. A plain brown paper bag arrives at the table; with a twist, the bag is opened, setting forth a wave of fragrant steam and smoke.
Inside? There’s a hill of delectably charred broccoli and cauliflower, tossed in a barbecue spice mix that gives the vegetables a hearty kick. Served with a bit of spiced apple cider vinegar and some rich remoulade, the brassicas are great to share and a lovely way to begin a meal.
Sandwiches are what Mendocino Farms is justifiably famous for, and Blue Cow keeps the legacy going. The French (Onion Short Rib) Dip is a highlight, even if it’s not particularly original: A slab of braised short ribs, unctuous and savory, sits happily under melted cave-aged Gruyère. Roasted mushrooms and sides of jus and horseradish-spiked crème fraiche are just the proverbial cherries on top.
The awkwardly named A Cuban Marries a Madame — a mash-up of the Cuban sandwich and the croque-madame sandwich — is equally delicious. It features a veritable sea of pork, in both honey-cured and Cuban-roasted forms, and the over-the-top garnish of a fried egg makes the dish irresistibly tasty.
Blue Cow also offers Big Plates, or regular entrées. The restaurant’s take on steak frites is noteworthy not just for the steak — which flaunts a delectable, deeply browned crust and a juicy interior — but for the side it comes with: poutine. Fat wedges of roasted potato are laced here with elegant melted cheese and a touch of gravy, giving the beloved Canadian comfort food a nice makeover.
The service fits the restaurant’s feel; the plaid-sporting waiters seem to appear at just the right moments and are both friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Essentially, it’s the kind of service one would appreciate anywhere, casual dining or otherwise.
It’s difficult for a restaurant to seem like a well-oiled machine, especially only a few weeks after its opening. Somehow, Blue Cow makes it seem effortless. Though there are some hiccups — the Tandoori Turkey Club sandwich is an odd stumble in execution, with floury naan and overcooked meat — it’s apparent that the restaurant is set to be a lasting highlight of Downtown Los Angeles.
A casual dining experience shouldn’t mean a cavalier approach to quality and service. In that sense, Blue Cow Kitchen and Bar sets the standard high.

It’s always darkest before dawn — and midterm week is particularly dark. Spring break is usually preceded by a few solid days in the soul-sucking dungeon better known as Leavey Library.
And so, for two weeks, USC is overrun with pessimism.
There’s something comforting about being pessimistic. When you decide that everything is doomed, you fool yourself into thinking that life, though bleak, is predictable. You maintain the illusion of control. That essay on supply chain management? There’s no need to worry if you think you’re going to fail anyway.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
What’s more, many people see pessimism as a sign of depth or intelligence. The word brings to mind the archetype of the well-respected professor who dismisses students’ arguments as products of youthful naïveté.
Although people usually speak of blind optimism, it’s easy to forget that blind pessimism isn’t any more rational.
Pessimism should not be confused with cynicism. A cynic is someone who holds high standards and believes that the world will always fail to live up to them. At the core of every cynic is an idealist who hasn’t quite given up.
By contrast, pessimists give up by default. Pessimism has nothing to do with standards: It is simply about seeing reality through a negative lens.
When we fall into the trap of pessimism, we forget that value judgments aren’t reality.
To avoid the tired glass-half-empty analogy, here’s a study abroad story: When I moved to Amsterdam, one of the first skills I had to master was biking in the dense, cobblestoned city center. At first, biking meant battling wind, narrowly avoiding cars and panicking about falling into a canal. Eventually, biking meant enjoying the crisp air, gliding past motorists and marveling at the reflection of the buildings in the water.
Ultimately, the facts were simple. I biked. There were cars. There were canals. The rest was just decoration. It was up to me to decide which perspective I liked better.
Some events, like sickness and natural disaster, are undeniably bad. One could argue that in the face of these factors, pessimism is the only option. But medical research has shown that pessimism can simply reinforce negativity.
In 2008, Harvard Men’s Health Watch reported that pessimists who underwent coronary bypasses were twice as likely as optimists to need rehospitalization.
You can decide your life is going downhill, but don’t expect the powers that be to listen. It’s better to expect nothing at all.

Having engaged in online debate with people who disapproved of my questions concerning Holocaust history, I found myself smeared as a Holocaust denier (which I’m not) by reputational terrorists. It worked. The blog that featured me (on subjects completely unrelated to the Holocaust) fired me, and I haven’t found a new home, except for blogs about the Holocaust, a subject that has interested me for over 50 years, now.
Did I cower in silent fear of further attacks? Quite the contrary. Aside from commenting on the consistently engaging articles of Maya Itah, I now blog in a monthly newsletter AND a quarterly Webzine, both of whose subjects embrace Holocaust revisionism.
No one else will have me anymore. Do I let that get me down? No way! I just retooled and cut loose harder than ever – on the only subject that’ll have my byline.
Great article inspiring hopefulness! The world is your oyster and its up to you to seize life by the horns

If children were being abducted, forced to join an army, made to watch their families die and having their childhoods taken away, would you try to stop it from happening?
That’s precisely the idea behind KONY 2012, a campaign started by Invisible Children, a humanitarian organization whose co-founder, Jason Russell, is a USC alumnus.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
If you’re unfamiliar with this issue — Joseph Kony is the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, a militant group made up mostly of abducted children. Kony says that he acts as a spokesperson for God and that his group fights for the Ten Commandments. The LRA originated in Uganda and has since spread to the Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan.
On Monday, a short film was released on YouTube by Invisible Children. It “aims to make Kony famous; not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice.” The film walks viewers through Kony’s career and the LRA’s atrocities, the action that was recently taken by Congress to help stop him and the increase of support for the movement.
As much support as there is for KONY 2012, Invisible Children has also faced criticism. The movement is certainly not perfect.
The organization backs the Ugandan and Sudanese armies, which have been riddled with accusations of rape and corruption. Moreover, Invisible Children has spent significant funds on the organization itself instead of direct measures that further the cause.
KONY 2012 leaves much to be desired. It remains uncertain whether the course of action Invisible Children is looking to take is the “right” one.
So why is this relevant?
For Americans struggling to prosper in the face of a recession, maybe it isn’t. Many people question the relative importance of this issue.
But as a human being, how could it not be?
If we don’t care about kids not being given the chance to grow up and if we don’t even look to save other human beings, what are we doing?
The LRA is known for murder, rape and mutilation, among other human rights violations. Kony is on the World’s Most Wanted List and has been indicted for war crimes.
Viewers were encouraged to share the video, and by Wednesday afternoon, the film had topped 8 million views, with more than 500,000 “likes” on the video. Russell wants to get younger people, celebrities and politicians in on the campaign to bring Kony to justice.
If you want to believe in the cause, you can certainly make it happen. We’re on a college campus. We’ve all seen how information can be put out there. The point of the campaign is to get the word out, and we all have the power to help in this regard.
The campaign alone will not topple the Ugandan warlord. But if enough people get behind KONY 2012, someone will eventually have to listen.
 
Mat Goldstein is an undeclared freshman. 
I’ve met Kony on several occasions. He’s interesting man with tons of charisma and boyish good looks. Don’t judge a book by it’s cover…and until you walked a 1,000 miles in Kony’s shoes, don’t hate.
I really hope this is a joke.
Duuuuude.
If all you have to do to get money in this crappy economy is make a slick video about some cause in another country that is hard for people to validate your spending, or look over your shoulder, than I am totally making one. 
I’ll do mine about cats in Bolivia used for taco meat. I will call it “Undetectable Kittens.” 
Thanks to everyone who never questions a cause!
Keep an eye out for my vid!

Anyone who believed this video is a fool. The LRA has been out of Uganda for years. And take a look at Invisible Children’s financials: http://c2052482.r82.cf0.rackcdn.com/images/737/original/FY11-Audited%20Financial%20Statements.pdf?1320205055

Even with financial aid, it can be tough to pay for tuition. It’s no surprise, then, that the rising cost of college has become a major point in the 2012 presidential campaign.
Though President Barack Obama and the Republican nominees have offered solutions of varying practicality, Mitt Romney’s suggestion on Monday at a town hall meeting in Youngstown, Ohio, shows an alarming lack of foresight on his part. Essentially, Romney said this: Want the government to pay for college? Enlist. And if you don’t want to do that, good luck finding a scholarship.
This is a man who has never served in the military — he was deferred from the draft for several years to conduct missionary work and attend college. Yet he is telling students that they should sign up as if it is a casual commitment.
For many students, military service isn’t an option for religious or moral reasons. Even students without such objections shouldn’t have to make a life-altering commitment just to receive an education.
His other suggestion is to “shop around” for an affordable college. This is a valid point. Students should know and understand the implications of taking on student loans. Going to that dream college may not be entirely prudent if you’re going to graduate thousands of dollars in debt, especially if there are less expensive options that provide a comparable education.
But the promotion of fiscal responsibility does not constitute a comprehensive plan to improve higher education in America. Romney failed to address the real issue.
Yes, students should make wise financial decisions when selecting a college. And yes, if students perform well, they can potentially receive a scholarship.
The fact remains that college tuition is at an all-time high. Rather than telling students to choose paths Romney himself did not follow, he should focus on reducing the overall cost of higher education.
Education is a critical factor for economic development. Considering the country’s current economic state, Romney’s failure to offer a plan to help Americans pay for college is incredibly short-sighted. The average student debt load is more than $25,000 and total student debt in America is more than $1 trillion. Though students shouldn’t expect free education, these numbers are too high not to warrant some form of government aid.
Obama’s current policies on education aren’t perfect, but at least he’s urging colleges to keep tuition low and continue college loan programs. Romney, on the other hand, supports a 25 percent reduction in Pell grants, which are federal funds for students in need of financial aid. Though this plan might seem economically efficient now, an undereducated America will only lead to a difficult future.
Romney’s suggestion to enlist in the armed forces is hypocritical and simply impractical. Though his fiscal advice is more viable, it still fails to solve the broader issue: thousands of students have to compromise their education because of tuition increases across the board. If Romney wants to solve the numerous problems currently plaguing America, he needs to put education at the top of his priorities.

To those commenters above who think this generation is entitled, I would say this: students trying to get an education are at least reducing their chances of being on public assistance later. Further, if there is no system in place to reduce tuition costs, then what? Only the wealthy/elite get to go to university?
Working your way through college is harder than it used to be, and it’s hard enough getting a job WITH a college education today. Certainly serving your country in exchange for education benefits is more than admirable, as is earning a scholarship. Interestingly, Romney didn’t serve, and I wonder if any of his kids did? Romney received ministerial and student deferments, and spent his time as a missionary in France (Bordeaux) instead of Vietnam. That was after a year at Stanford. 
There isn’t enough money and no one is entitled to a free education. However, the United States needs to remain competitive, and higher education must be a top priority. Yes it is sad that so many Americans feel so entitled. What about the rest of them, who work hard and do not?
The point was that our economic future depend in great part on a well educated populous that is trained to be productive.  Sounds like some of the other comments here come from the type that only care for their individual success with no care or forethought of the downside of an undereducated country – which includes negative economic effects overall which could really hit you in the portfolio where it hurts later.  Hey, if student aged people (and lets throw in the underemployed and  unemployed) all enlisted to pay for their education, who will be around to ‘serve’ you?  Never mind that the country wouldn’t have the military budget to take on the ranks of every college-bound student needing some loans or financial aid.
“Burke Gibson is a freshman majoring in economics.”
I hope when Burke Gibson is a senior majoring in economics, he’ll look back on this article and laugh at what he thought he knew.
I’m sorry but I don’t believe you are entitled to a secondary education. Its the culture of I’m entitled to this, gimme gimme gimme. I’m sorry but if you don’t want to serve, or your parents didn’t make the right decisions to save, its up to YOU to finance your own education and save up. Society owes you nothing, Burke.

The post college debt crisis will be the next “mortgage crisis bubble.” You go to college, for a worthless degree (please watch link above), and you will pay both literally (if you’re lucky to find a job afterwards) and figuratively (you’re going to go through lots of heartache and disillusionment). This will exacerbate the wobbling economy. Not everyone should go to college. And not every youth is entitled to a college education. And nor is college for everyone. 
btw James, Gibson is a econ major. So he must have some basis in economics…LOL!!!!
What an amateurish article, both in writing style and content.  I respect the kid’s opinion, but it really has no basis in economics or principles.  Most of all, the government doesn’t owe you anything buddy.  The most entitled generation ever….. so sad.
@James: what an incredibly vague and not well-thought-out criticism.

Wally Pfister, the cinematographer who has established himself for his crisp, clean visuals, is planning on switching over into directing  feature films this year.
The acclaimed cinematographer has had a close collaboration with visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan, and the duo have thus far paired together for seven films, which include Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and the forthcoming The Dark Knight Rises.
Pfister won an Oscar last year for his efforts in Inception, and his work was most recently seen in Moneyball, which was nominated for a number of Oscars this year, including Best Picture.
Pfister has been eyeing a feature film debut for nearly a decade now. In fact, directing is far from new ground for the Oscar-winning cinematographer. In addition to directing a number of commercials, he was also involved in creating a PSA for The Montana Meth Project, which also featured the work of several prominent filmmakers, including Darren Aronofsky, Tony Kaye and Alejandro González Iñárritu.
There have been a number of cinematographers who have switched over into directing. Barry Sonnenfeld, who worked with Joel and Ethan Coen on films such as Raising Arizona and Miller’s Crossing, has since switched teams, and has gone on to helm the Men in Black franchise.
The screenplay for his film has been written by newcomer Jack Paglen, and while the logline is still under wraps, production is scheduled for the fall.
