To take a break from this season’s heavy focus on the presidential race, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a panel discussion Tuesday evening to call attention to another side of the upcoming election: California’s ballot initiatives.
The panel discussion in the Taper Hall of Humanities focused on several of the eleven initiatives voters will see on the ballot next Tuesday, then opened up for student questions about any of the propositions.
Panelists at the event, titled “Schools, Taxes and Crime: Making Sense of California’s Ballot Initiatives,” included campaign experts and students from USC’s political organizations. Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute, moderated the discussion.
The four panelists offered their perspectives on Proposition 30 and 38, two competing initiatives that propose different tax increases that would allocate money for the California K-12 public education system.
Rose Kapolczynski, a former campaign manager for Sen. Barbara Boxer, said she personally supports Prop. 30, Gov. Jerry Brown’s tax plan. His plan would raise taxes on the wealthiest Californians and increase the sales tax across the board.
Kaplczynski, however, predicts the measure is unlikely to pass.
“It’s always very hard to raise taxes on anyone,” she said. “And when you have two competing tax initiatives, that obviously creates doubt for voters.”
Fritz Pielstick, political director of the USC College Democrats, said his organization supports Prop. 30, but not Prop. 38.
“Raising taxes on the wealthy, who are already doing well in this economy, makes it a fair ballot measure,” he said. “[Prop. 30’s] sales tax is also fair because there is a direct correlation between the taxes you pay and how much you consume — you have some autonomy over your own taxation.”
Maddy Lansky, president of the USC College Republicans, said Republicans are often faced with the choice between supporting social services like public education and avoiding tax increases. Lansky said her party opposes Prop. 30 and Prop. 38 because there are other solutions to the education crisis that don’t involve raising taxes.
The conversation then turned to Proposition 32, which would prohibit deductions by corporations and unions of employees’ wages for political use.
Pielstick opposes the measure because it allows large corporations who don’t depend on payroll deductions for campaign contributions to continue wielding political influence, while impeding the influence of other special interest groups like teachers and firefighters.
“Republicans generally support this measure because it gives an unfair advantage to corporations, who tend to contribute to the Republican Party,” he explained.
The panel then discussed Proposition 37, which would require food manufacturers to label their products if made from genetically engineered organisms.
Fiona Hutton, president of consulting firm Fiona Hutton & Associates, said support for Prop. 37, which was initially very high among California mothers, has waned since the campaign opposing the proposition has exploited two small problems in the initiative: the cost impact for consumers and bizarre exemptions to the rule.
Prop. 37, Hutton said, has also garnered significantly more attention from the electorate than other measures.
“There’s been a lot of chatter about 30 and 38 but [Proposition 37] is something different,” explained Hutton. “That’s why it has traction.”
Hutton said that tax initiatives, such as Prop. 30, on the other hand, are often misunderstood, and voters aren’t alarmed by the repercussions that could arise if they don’t pass.
“A ‘yes’ vote on an initiative requires inspiring passion in the electorate,” said Hutton. “I just don’t think the governor has produced a visceral message on Proposition 30.”
Pielstick said the reason for the enthusiasm gap is because voters can more easily visualize the repercussions of Prop. 37, which affects the everyday activity of purchasing food.
“The scope of people who can tangibly see the effects of 37 is much larger [than 30 and 38], even though the actual effect is much smaller,” Pielstick said.
Lansky also noted that because Prop. 30 and Prop. 38 compete with one another, voters find themselves confused.
The panelists also addressed the issue of low voter turnout. Kapolczynski explained that voters often have two major questions that prevent them from casting their vote: “Is my vote meaningful?” and “Is voting easy and does it fit into my life?”
“The first stems from cynicism about government, and we can’t change that,” Kapolczynski said. “But we can address the second. We can make it easier for people to vote.”
Kapolczynski supports switching entirely to voting by mail, which she said is extremely effective and saves money.
Gwen Holst, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law and neuroscience, said the panel was useful because it addressed the messaging behind propositions.
“Tonight I learned more about the machine behind the passing and marketing of propositions than the actual subject matter of them,”  Holst said. “Promoters of the propositions need to spell out to people that schools will be shut down, not just that school districts need more money.”

As the superstorm Sandy continues to wreak havoc along the East Coast, USC students also felt the impacts of the physical destruction.
The storm, which reached New Jersey on Monday and has since enveloped much of the East Coast, has some USC students concerned for the safety of their family and friends.
At least 45 people have died because of the storm, including former USC Song Girl Claudene Christian, who died after a ship she was aboard sank in the hurricane. The coaches of the USC Song Girls released a statement Monday expressing their condolences.
Most of the deaths occurred from the damage caused by the storm, such as falling trees or electrocution caused by stepping in puddles near fallen power lines.
Worries about safety prompted the university to send emails out to students whose permanent addresses are in affected zip codes.
“This can be traumatic for students and we wanted to let you know that we are concerned about your well-being and the safety of your families,” wrote Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean for Student Affairs.
Zion Samuel, a freshman majoring in biochemistry whose family lives in Maryland, said he was worried about their safety, but that many East Coast families are used to big storms.
“My dad went and bought the supplies we usually get for hurricanes, like water,” Samuel said.
A representative from USC’s Counseling Center said that students can schedule an appointment if they want to talk about their concerns. If they have pressing worries, students can walk in for a crisis appointment.
Though weaker than it was just 24 hours ago, Sandy has left destruction from Georgia to Maine. Floods, power outages and 65-mile-per-hour winds continue to cause disorder on the East Coast.
As of Tuesday night, 6 million people were without electricity, and many major subways and airports were still shut down. Sandy is the most widespread destructive storm in recent history, and in some places, schools are not expected to open for at least a few more days.
State governments are struggling to counter the effects of the storm, which is interfering greatly with everyday life. Despite the severity of the storm, however, many students on the East Coast do not seem exceedingly concerned about the safety of their homes.
“My parents are worried about losing power,” said Sophia Geanacopoulos, a freshman studying international relations global business. Geanacopoulos also said, however, she is not overly concerned for her family in Boston. “My mom is always prepared for these storms.”
Social media is playing an unprecedented role in the crisis, with many East Coast residents relying on Twitter and Facebook for information about the storm. Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom reported that 10 pictures are being posted each second with the hashtag “Sandy.”
The Federal Emergency Management Agency also urged people to communicate with loved ones using social media, as phone lines often get clogged during disasters.

The pantheon of West Coast hip-hop has, for years, included only four lyrically esteemed and legendary individuals: N.W.A. cohorts Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, the age-defying Snoop Dogg and the one and only Tupac Shakur. Those four — and only those four — comprise the Mount Rushmore of left coast rap. Arguments for inclusion to the pantheon can be made for many (Mac Dre, Ice T and Nate Dogg, to name a few), but those arguments can, at their most persuasive, result merely in an honorable mention.
Simply put, in the nearly 20 years since Pac’s murder, no emcee has proven worthy of carrying the torch once held by these historical greats. That is, until now.
Kendrick Lamar is worthy.
Kendrick “K-Dot” Lamar is, following the renowned tradition of Snoop Dogg and Eminem, the latest protégé of Dre, who thankfully took some time off from selling overpriced headphones to officially sign Lamar to his Aftermath Entertainment label in March.
By this point, two independent releases — O.D. (Overly Dedicated) in 2010 and Section.80 in 2011 — had already earned Lamar a reputation.
He was characterized as a prodigy spitting honesty — a direct result of his environment, with music that spawned out of true struggle instead of the will of faceless billionaire record executives. He was, for all intents and purposes, branded as the anti-Drake. This dichotomy eventually led to the two artists collaborating on Lamar’s first major label album, good kid m.A.A.d city, released last week to resounding critical praise. Lamar’s debut is a concept album that, through recurring characters and themes, tells the story of a young K-Dot attempting, and failing, to escape the influence of his hometown: Compton, California.
This album is not only the best of the year, but also one of the best hip-hop albums of recent memory. This is mostly because of three reasons: the artist’s impeccable lyricism, Lamar’s ambitiously overarching narrative and  excellent production.
THE LYRICISM
Lamar’s genuine ability to manipulate words is partly why he stands out. Whereas some rappers (e.g.: Lil’ Wayne) tend to sound like mumbling sea turtles that occasionally rhyme, Lamar enunciates his lyrics with surgical precision. His voice is distinct and the many accents he plays with add a tangible sense of character and eccentricity to his songs.
Furthermore, K-Dot is a gifted wordsmith. He uses every lyrical trick in the book — internal rhyming, symbolism, vivid imagery, double entendres, changes in rhythmic flow, etc. — and uses them so often and so cleverly that it is virtually impossible to catch them all on the first listen. This is not a problem, however, because after listening to good kid m.A.A.d city you will not want to expose your ears to anything else for days. Lamar’s lyrical mastery is clearly demonstrated on “Real,” the album’s penultimate track: “You love your hood, might even love it to death / but what love got to do with it when you don’t love yourself?”
THE NARRATIVE
good kid m.A.A.d city tells the story of a younger K-Dot and his life experiences in Compton, many of which he confirms as authentic. The narrative paints Lamar’s childhood as complex and multidimensional, maybe illustrated in the album title’s double-meaning acronym: my Angry Adolescence divided, or, my Angel’s on Angel dust.
And on most of the album’s 12 tracks, there are (for lack of a better term) “skits” with monologues from and dialogue between many recurring characters, including Lamar’s parents. In conjunction with the themes of the songs themselves, these skits tell a story of youth, danger, faith and opportunity.
Notable tracks of this imaginative nature include “The Art of Peer Pressure” and the album’s 12-minute masterpiece of an apex “Sing About Me / I’m Dying of Thirst,” in which Lamar asks his fans to honor his memory if he were to pass away: “When the lights shut off, and it’s my turn to settle down my main concern, promise that you will, sing, about me. / Promise that you will, sing, about me.”
THE PRODUCTION
Moreover, this album’s production is first-rate. A wide variety of producers, including Hit-Boy and Pharrell Williams, contributed to the tracks. The atmosphere changes from track to track without becoming jarring. It fluctuates from dark to laid-back to club-banging without skipping a beat, and it’s always crisp and inventive.
Also, as fans of ’90s West Coast hip-hop will appreciate, the beats of the tracks “m.A.A.d city” and “Compton” sound like they could be straight from The Chronic or Tha Doggfather. This album’s production is, in the end, what holds the conceptual structure together.
Hip-hop is at a crossroads. Concurrently, the art form is at its best and its worst. Though many artists and groups (such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill, Slaughterhouse and Odd Future) continue to push the boundaries of hip-hop’s capacity for excellence by creating thought-provoking and intelligently crafted music, the most popular mainstream artists of today (such as Lil’ Wayne, Drake, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, etc.) continue to produce music that is light on intellect and heavy on boring, repetitive subjects (women, cars, drugs, money and women).
Hopefully, the release of good kid m.A.A.d city will mark a turning point in the public consciousness regarding hip-hop. Though some might claim otherwise, hip-hop truly is an art form, and Lamar’s music represents just how beautiful and dynamic of an art form it can be.
Perhaps most telling of the album’s quality is the fact that even those who aren’t fans of hip-hop can appreciate Lamar’s artistry and imagination. The only question left to ask is whether or not K-Dot will continue to produce works of this caliber and ultimately realize his full potential, becoming an all-time legend alongside the likes of Tupac, Eminem and The Notorious B.I.G.
Regardless, the California music community needs to dust off its chisel and mallet — the Mount Rushmore of West Coast hip-hop is primed for another face.
Tupac has been dead for 20 years?  How come he keeps releasing new tracks?

I should be writing about horror movies today, but there’s something more pressing going on in the film world than ghouls and ghosts and paranormal activity. The role of race and identity in Cloud Atlas takes precedence.
Stay with me — I know this sounds like a communication/film term paper, but race has long been a point of controversy in film and remains worthy of discussion.
Tow Tykwer, Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski worked as the writers, directors and producers on the film, which is based on David Mitchell’s novel of the same name. In the wake of filmmaker Lana — formerly Larry — coming forward as a transgender in late July with a promotional video for the film, identity has become a major point of discussion in relation to the movie and, in turn, informs the way we should view the film.
Cloud Atlas follows six narratives (with many actors playing six to seven roles) that illuminate how our actions affect the past, present and future. It’s a story that transcends time and shows how a soul is shaped from a killer to a hero, and how an act of kindness goes on to inspire a revolution over the course of many years.
A film with multiple storylines that crosses generational boundaries sounds complex as-is, but almost every character switches their race, age and sometimes gender, making the film controversial as it plays with these themes to make a greater point about modern perceptions of identity. The film has received a downpour of backlash as a result.
Specifically, the Media Action Network for Asian Americans recently responded to the portrayal of Asian-Americans in Cloud Atlas.
“Cloud Atlas missed a great opportunity,” said MANAA’s founding President Guy Aoki in an interview with Asian Week. “The Korea story’s protagonist is an Asian man — an action hero who defies the odds and holds off armies of attackers. He’s the one who liberates Doona Bae from her repressive life and encourages her to join the resistance against the government. It would have been a great, stereotype-busting role for an Asian-American actor to play, as Asian-American men aren’t allowed to be dynamic or heroic very often.”
Aoki goes on to attack the casting of Jim Sturgess in “yellowface.”
MANAA isn’t wrong. The film undeniably lacks the presence of leading Asian men. But though this is true, the ultimate goal of the movie is to make a greater point about race and identity, not to reinforce racism. Almost every actor plays a different race to show how a soul evolves over time, not to offend audiences with (what some might call) poorly rendered makeup.
This is not a film about race, but it touches on racial constructions and ideologies to make a point about how the soul of the person transcends time, going beyond physical limitations.
White actor Jim Sturgess transforms from an American businessman (who helps a black slave earn his freedom) traveling through the South Pacific to a Korean revolutionary (who frees clone Somni-451 so she can go on to become the leader of the revolution) in a futuristic Neo-Seoul set in the year 2144.
When the viewer sees this they are supposed to think about the person his character is and how that character develops over time, rather than his superficial, physical attributes in each individual time period.
The same goes for Asian actress Doona Bae, who plays a Korean revolutionary, a white wife and a Latina factory worker, among many other roles; and black actress Halle Berry, who takes on the roles of a German-Jewish wife, a black journalist and an old Asian doctor, to name a few.
There’s no denying that Hollywood is dominated by white leading men and that there is a clear lack of representation of minorities in leading roles. Though I agree with MANAA, in that there could have been more Asian men cast in lead roles, by singling out an issue with casting decisions, we are missing the greater point of the movie.
Looking at this film through a narrow lens only blinds audiences from seeing the ultimate message: We are defined by our souls, not physical attributes.
Accordingly, the film plays with the notion of switching races so that we really notice it and see how it works to make a greater statement about identity. It does not reinforce racist tropes but rather challenges them.
By having the same actors play many races, ages and genders, we see their transformation; we recognize the actors in each era so we can track how their soul transcends time.
Viewers need to focus less on how race works in Cloud Atlas and look at the film as a whole to fully understand its message. There are simply too many messages in each subplot alone to focus on these specific details. And when we focus so intensely on superficial elements, our analysis of the film in turn becomes superficial.
So, yes, MANAA stands correct to a certain degree. White men are significantly more represented than Asian men in Cloud Atlas, but the film is not racist. We need to think big picture, and the big picture is: Who we are is defined by the person inside;  physical attributes are irrelevant.

if it is not about race then how many of the white guys played black characters? I mean obviously there had to a few if race was truly something they did not care about. so how many
What about the Korean leading lady? Does she not exist? Her role is one of the biggest roles of the movie, without her the whole story falls apart. She’s even worshiped as a god in the post apocalyptic story. Her character could be the most important within the whole story and has a presence even into the next story.
Excotic asian women adorned in hollywood films are not new, asian men as lead roles are

Horror can take on many different forms. It involves everything from the creaking sounds of an old, abandoned mansion to ghost girls hiding in dark corners, from the haunting footsteps of a serial killer to the unshakable feeling of claustrophobia. American Horror Story, the hit miniseries drama that returned this month to FX, tackles all these tropes.
Taking names · Two episodes into its second installment, American Horror Story: Asylum is as scornful and sorrowful (and scary) as ever. – | Photo courtesy of Michael Yarish
The supernatural show caught audiences’ eye last year when its creator, Ryan Murphy (the same mind behind Glee), brought a new perspective to a genre that, until now, was largely thought unfit for television shows.
With a perfect mix of supernatural and psychological horror, engaging storylines, compelling characters and very disturbing imagery to accompany it all, audiences fell in love with the show, and so did critics. During the last Emmy Awards, American Horror Story earned the most nominations — 17 total.
But the story of the Harmons, the family that moved into “Murder House” in season one, is closed. The mystery of the now-iconic Rubber Man has been solved, and season two (which premiered Oct. 17) now brings a whole new and entirely different set of characters, settings and plotlines to share sleepless nights with.
American Horror Story: Asylum is set at Briarcliff, a mental institution for the criminally insane during the 1960s, and revolves around the horrors and abominations that happen inside. If the first season was about ghosts and other supernatural apparitions, season two promises to go deeper inside the human mind and its fears.
Murphy and Brad Falchuk, the co-creators of the show, have stated that the main question Asylum raises is “What would happen if you couldn’t distinguish who is more insane in a mental institution — the patients or the people who run it?”
Being set in a strict Catholic institution, viewers can also expect a fight between the eternal foes of faith and science. All these themes take form as schizophrenic patients, power-mad scientists and clergymen, demonic possessions and even hints of an alien abduction.
After the first couple episodes, audiences have now had the chance to become familiar with a majority of the main characters, their motivations, their illnesses, as well as their horrors. Most of the original cast from season one returns, though, this being an anthology series, they play different roles.
Emmy Award-winning Jessica Lange is Sister Judy, the mother superior who runs Briarcliff with unmovable strictness, verging on cruelty and inhumanity. For her, mental patients are nothing but sinners who are in need of repentance, and it’s her duty to bring them back onto the “right” track. She is opposed by Dr. Arden (James Cromwell), a man of science who views the inmates not as evil-doers but as experiments, and Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto), a moral psychiatrist who is genuinely concerned about the subhuman conditions of the asylum.
The rest of the ensemble is rounded out by Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), a malleable and fragile nun with no strength or willpower whatsoever, Kit Walker (Evan Peters), a young man wrongly accused (at least according to him) of being a notable killer of women, and Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), a reporter who finds herself trapped in the asylum after learning its dark secrets, to name just a few characters.
The first two episodes that have already aired served, more than anything else, as an introduction to this diverse range of characters and what led them to be involved with the institution, not without its good doses of scares and freak-outs.
The series, as a whole, requires intelligence and attention, something that will seem either valuable and refreshing for some, or too sophisticated for the mindlessness that TV is supposed to offer for others. Also, it is advisable to watch each season from the start (there are online and on-demand options), and not halfway through, since the episodes are far from being stand-alone stories.
But once the viewer gets the hang of its style, there’s nothing left to do but sit back and enjoy the disturbing, creepy and endlessly fascinating nightmares Asylum has brought to life. The storylines’ originality and brightness, as well as the visual design of the series, are things to greatly admire.
About a dozen episodes of Asylum still remain. If they continue the way they have been going, they will not disappoint. American Horror Story has managed to bring an air of true and original terror into a medium that was hardly well known for accomplishing that.
Horror fans cannot miss this show, as well as people who enjoy watching something highly different on their small screens every week. It is intriguing. It is smart. It is very, very scary. You will be committed.
 
American Horror Story: Asylum airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on FX.

Every Saturday, a team of 10 USC School of Cinematic Arts graduate students, including David Freedman (TV production), Salim Lemelle (screenwriting) and Rachel Applebaum (acting), film five full episodes of a roundtable review series called Just Seen It.
Roundtable review · USC School of Cinematic Arts graduate school alumni Sean Wright (left), Leah Aldridge and David Freedman share their perspectives on the latest film releases on their television show, Just Seen It. – | Photo courtesy of David Freedman
The show aims to deliver “reviews you can use” by sorting new movies and television shows into three categories: See It, Stream It and Skip It. Producer David Freedman has overseen the production of more than 350 episodes and has recently orchestrated a move from online distribution to regular PBS airings.
“I was sitting in Café 84,” Freedman recalled, “and I was listening to three film students who had just seen a movie — no, I don’t remember what the movie was — but they were arguing vehemently about it, and they were making very passionate, very intelligent, informative comments. I thought, ‘this is very interesting.’”
Freedman then came up with an idea for a review show centered on student artists arguing intelligently about contemporary culture.
One of the only producers in his MFA program, Freedman “started corralling people [he] knew and really liked to film a pilot” in December 2010. He shopped the episode around and drew the interest of a basic cable executive, who started developing the show. Freedman’s team began filming weekly spots and growing an Internet fan base, eventually getting picked up by PBS.
Freedman, who had grown up watching Siskel and Ebert’s At The Movies, felt that “informative, smart, educational reviews” were missing from the contemporary conversation, especially on television. Just Seen It gives a democratic spin to your typical review: Settling on three cast members per episode, Freedman’s goal is not to present a point/counterpoint but rather a discussion. With 10 dedicated students in the roster — from undergraduates to Ph.D. candidates — Just Seen It aims to “cover a lot of different perspectives.”
“We don’t memorize lines,” Lemelle said. “We don’t rehearse anything. We write a review where we break it down into three sections: writing, acting and production. Then the director makes bullet points for each reviewer based off what we said, and all we do in prep is read the bullet points. We save our comments for the show because we want it to be a real conversation.”
This balance of preparedness and spontaneity makes for an informed discussion that doesn’t feel dry to viewers.
Applebaum stresses that the show is structured so that viewers can see their own perspectives reflected in the conversation. For instance, if she’s reviewing a horror film, she approaches the film from the perspective of a “novice,” while Lemelle might represent the horror aficionado.
“What’s cool is that we don’t only just review the things we want to see,” Freeman said. “Mostly we review what fits into our schedule … so you’ve got a broader range of responses. Frequently, a reviewer will bash on a movie but then give it a ‘See It’ verdict by saying, ‘If this is your kind of movie, you’re gonna love it.’”
This is consistent with the show’s core values. As film students and young artists themselves, the team members understand the vast amount of passion and effort that goes into making just a couple of hours of entertainment.
“We’re always respectful,” Freedman said. “We clearly feel and understand how difficult it is to make a movie or a TV show, and when we give something a ‘Skip It,’ we don’t do it lightly. We really believe it’s not worth your time and money.”
Freedman warns, though, that studios are doing everything they can to control “the Twitter effect” on bad movies.
“If a movie is really bad, they won’t have a screening for it,” he said. “Or they’ll have a screening the night before the movie comes out.”
Good movies will get screenings well in advance with no reporting embargoes: They seek to cultivate buzz. But Freedman warns that, by limiting the reporting on less-promising movies, “studios are doing a disservice to themselves” and their potential audiences. Some films might benefit from a positive, practical review format like that of Just Seen It, and viewers will know ahead of time if a movie will suit their personal tastes.
Applebaum stresses, however, that Just Seen It reviewers are not solely focused on objective, academic criticism.
“We’re giving analysis too,” Applebaum added. “Not necessarily ‘film school’ analysis, but like if a plot doesn’t move and you’re a plot person, now you know that the plot doesn’t move, but it’s a character-driven piece, and if you’re watching for good performance then you’ll enjoy that.”
Applebaum hopes that Just Seen It will help elevate the entertainment industry by holding artists accountable.
“It’s nice to be pointed toward something that will inspire you, instead of thinking ‘Wow, Hollywood is making a lot of crap,’” she said.
Just Seen It’s reviewers are becoming more inspired by television shows as well. Unlike Siskel and Ebert, Freedman’s cast reviews TV pilots and gives retrospective analysis of shows that are on hiatus.
“We really are in the golden age of television,” Lemelle remarked. “Each episode is a mini movie now and it’s incredible … that is really where a lot of the interesting and fascinating things are happening in media.”
Television is central to Freedman’s own artistic vision: “I want to tell a 10-year story; I don’t want to tell a two-hour story.”
So far, his two-year story has been an incredibly rewarding experience.
“We’re the only ones who review movies the way people actually digest movies and TV shows now, and that’s See It, Stream It, Skip It. We’re a machine, and it’s just so much fun doing the shows now.”
 
Just Seen It has been picked up by PBS through 2012. It airs Saturdays at 6 p.m. and can be found online at JustSeenIt.com.

Senior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee were named as semifinalists for the 2012 Maxwell Award on Tuesday, Maxwell Club President Ron Jaworski announced.
The Maxwell Award, which is in its 76th season in existence, is given annually to the best football player in the country. Previous winners include Stanford’s Andrew Luck, Auburn’s Cam Newton and Florida’s Tim Tebow, who won it twice. Other NFL quarterbacks, including Drew Brees, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning, took home the award while in college.
Barkley entered the 2012 regular season as the Heisman Trophy frontrunner but has slowly fallen out of contention following two upset losses. Even still, he has accumulated 2,266 yards with 25 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Lee, meanwhile, is currently second nationally in receiving yards with 1129 yards and also has 10 touchdowns on 76 receptions. He racked up a Pac-12 record 345 yards to go along with two touchdowns in USC’s 39-36 loss to Arizona.
Barkley and Lee are one of two teammate combos in the semifinalist group, which consists of 16 players. The other duo is Oregon running backs Kenjon Barner and De’Anthony Thomas. UCLA senior running back Johnathan Franklin also makes an appearance, giving the Pac-12 five players in the running for the award.
Current Heisman frontrunner Collin Klein highlights the list as the quarterback for the undefeated Kansas State, ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings.
Three finalists for the Maxwell Award will be announced on Nov. 19,  and a final winner is set to be crowned on ESPN on Dec. 6.

Senior safety T.J. McDonald has been named among 15 semifinalists for the 2012 Jim Thorpe Award, awarded annually to the top defensive back in college football.

McDonald, a Thorpe Award semifinalist for the second consecutive year, has a team-high 66 tackles to go with three pass deflections, an interception and a blocked field goal.
McDonald began his USC career as a backup strong safety in his freshman year, racking up only seven tackles. Since then, he has started all but two games at free safety and has amassed 229 tackles and seven interceptions in 31 career starts.
The two-time co-captain made the Pro Football Weekly All-American first team last year, joining his father Tim as the first father-son All-American first-teamers in USC history.
McDonald joins Oregon cornerback Ifo Ekpre-Olomu and Oregon State cornerback Jordan Poyer as the three Pac-12 representatives among the 15 semifinalists.
The Southeastern Conference has the most representatives in the semifinalist pool with four nominations. Former LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne was the Thorpe Award winner last season.
The Thorpe Award, created in 1986, is named after Jim Thorpe, considered one of the greatest athletes of his time.
Thorpe, who competed in football, track, basketball, lacrosse and baseball at the collegiate level, was also a gold medalist in the decathlon and pentathlon in the 1912 Olympics and the first president of the National Football League.
A committee of Jim Thorpe Association members will narrow the field to three finalists, who will be announced Nov. 19.
Over 50 sportswriters, sportscasters, former players and coaches will then vote to determine the winner, who will be announced at the Home Depot College Football Awards Show in Orlando, Fla. on Dec. 6.
A presentation and banquet will commemorate the winner in February in Oklahoma City.

Something important got lost in all the disappointment and frustration and anger after USC’s loss in Arizona last week.
BCS national title hopes dashed; flights to Miami unbooked. People more or less said the season was over.
Celebrate · With a shot at a major bowl game still in tact, Trojan fans should be out in full force Saturday to root for their home team. A win against Oregon could help USC make charge to the Rose Bowl in January. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
But it’s not: USC still controls its own destiny to the Rose Bowl.
Yes, the Rose Bowl. The “Granddaddy of Them All.” Where USC really belongs.
Making it to Pasadena on New Year’s Day is never something to be looked down upon, no matter how hyped a team is. The Trojans have played in the Rose Bowl Game 33 times and has won 24 of them. It has won more Rose Bowls than any other team has even played in (Michigan has played in 20 and won 8, both good for second-best). Put simply, USC owns the Rose Bowl -— the most prestigious game in college football, and that is something to be proud of.
Now, the Rose Bowl would be a big-time accomplishment for this No. 17 Trojan team. But it’s something withreach.
The Trojans have two conferences losses and still sit in first place in the Pac-12 South. UCLA has two conference losses as well. Arizona already had three before knocking off USC, and Arizona State already has three as well.
That means if the Trojans take care of business against the Bruins and the Sun Devils, they remain in the driver’s seat to represent the South in the Pac-12 division championship game.
Of course, that also means they have to take care of business against Oregon.
Ah yes, the Oregon Ducks. They of 53 points-per-game and a 34-point average margin of victory. Before the season, this was supposed to be “Semifinal Saturday,” with Oregon and USC facing off as well as Alabama and LSU. Well, both the Trojans and the Tigers have slipped now, which the Ducks and Crimson Tide are plowing through everyone.
It would seem as if this weekend has been rendered meaningless, but it hasn’t. We might not have a de facto BCS national championship semifinal taking place at the Coliseum on Saturday, but what we have is nonetheless one of the most important games of the year — for both teams.
If the Ducks win, they get through what still must be considered the toughest game on their schedule, despite a trip to Corvallis in late November for the Civil War. For the Trojans, a loss would mean they need help. Three conference defeats would tie them with the Wildcats, who obviously own the tie-breaker. For the Trojans to win the South under this circumstance, Arizona would need to lose at least one of its final four games, which is plausible but far from a sure thing.
If USC wins it would accomplish two extremely important things: the team garners a signature victory for the season and gain some much-needed momentum with several tough games yet to be had. But more importantly, it proves to the conference that USC is still a threat to be reckoned with. If there is a rematch in the Pac-12 championship game, it would be in Eugene, Ore. USC would go up there knowing that they can beat the Ducks. They would have done it already this year, and they did it at Autzen Stadium a year ago.
A USC win would also put newfound pressure on the Ducks. Seeimingly knocked out of the national title picture, they would suddenly be faced with the prospect of having to win out to even have a shot at the Rose Bowl. A loss to either Stanford or Oregon State would give at least one of those teams the tiebreaker over the Ducks, and neither of those games are shoo-in victories.
So don’t for a second believe that this game “doesn’t matter.” The Trojans played games that “didn’t matter” for two years. This game is not one of them. USC hasn’t played in a bowl game — any bowl game — in more than two years. The national championship game is pretty damn big aspirations for a program’s first postseason appearance in three years. The Rose Bowl is too, but at least the Rose Bowl is the Trojans’ house.
There are exactly zero starters on this Trojan team who have played in the Rose Bowl. In fact there’s only one player who ever has, and that’s sixth-year safety Drew McAllister. Fifth-year senior center Khaled Holmes was redshirting the last time the Trojans were in Pasadena on Jan. 1. Even more, there are only six players on this squad who have played in any bowl game. That was the Emerald Bowl, which is played at a baseball stadium and doesn’t really count.
So for Matt Barkley, the most successful quarterback in Trojan history, and Robert Woods, the most successful receiver in USC history, there would be no shame in ending their careers in Pasadena instead of Miami. In fact, that’s probably the way it should be.
 
“Any Given Saturday” runs every other Wednesday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Nick at burtonn@usc.edu.
Corrections as follows: Arizona St. has lost only two games, not three. Drew McAllister is a fifth year senior who could apply for a sixth yr.

No. 17 USC held its first practice Tuesday after suffering a stunning defeat in Tucson last Saturday. The team won’t have much time to rest, however, as No. 4 Oregon comes to the Coliseum this weekend.
Concerns · Senior quarterback Matt Barkley has thrown eight interceptions through eight games. He only threw seven in 2011. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We’ve got to get over [the loss],” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.  “I think we’d be naive to think that the game is completely out of sight … but we have no time to look back with a great opponent, maybe the best team in the country, coming in here Saturday.”
USC’s two biggest problems in its loss to Arizona have been reoccurring themes all season: penalties and turnovers. USC is the most penalized team in the nation, and committed a whopping 13 penalties in Tucson. USC is also tied for 95th in the country in turnovers, and had five big ones last weekend.
“The big differences between [this year and last year] are the negative plays,” Kiffin said. “We’ve given up more sacks, we’ve had way more penalties, and then our third-down conversions on offense … When you group those things together, that is the glaring difference between the two years.”
Key players on the team agreed that there were too many things that went wrong aganst the Wildcats.
“This team has too much pride,” junior wide receiver Robert Woods said.
Though USC beat Oregon last season 38-35, the Ducks are a much more dangerous team in 2012. They average 53.4 points per game, which makes them the highest scoring team in the country. The biggest difference this year, however, is their defense, which senior quarterback Matt Barkley acknowledged is going to be tough to face.
“[Oregon’s] a very physical defense,” Barkley said. “They force a lot of turnovers, so it comes down to us protecting the ball.”
When talking about Oregon, however, it will always be the offense that gets the bulk of the attention, and Kiffin praised them, particularly their new quarterback.
“When you look at [Oregon] they’re the best they’ve ever been. I think the quarterback [Marcus Mariota] is the difference,” Kiffin said. “If you look at the old Oregon teams, they were still winning games but they were winning games in the second half. … This is a different Oregon team; this team has taken care of almost everyone in the first half.”

If you drive north on Vermont Avenue, beginning just west of Compton, you travel through the Latino-dominated community surrounding USC, pass Koreatown and end up gawking at ritzy homes at the base of the Hollywood Hills. Too often, however, these diverse Los Angeles communities are extremely isolated from one another.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Such de facto segregation deals a huge blow to the cultural life of Los Angeles. So many Angelenos, including USC students, fail to take advantage of all that this multicultural playground has to offer, but they should.
At the seventh-annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar hosted at USC on Saturday, researchers, journalists and students gathered to discuss, learn and exchange information about the history of the L.A. area.
In a Daily Trojan article on the event, students expressed feelings of general lack of awareness regarding L.A. history, as well as shock at the powerful influence of white supremacy in the city during the ’60s and ’70s — despite California’s reputation as a progressive state.
This demonstrates two important realities about the insular nature of USC as a community within Los Angeles. Foremost, many students are not knowledgeable about L.A. history, which might be a direct result of their lack of engagement with the diverse communities and cultures that are part of this history.
Number two, students seem to have forgotten how racial divides continue to influence the city. Los Angeles has a long and unpleasant history specifically with racial conflict. Twenty years ago, when the L.A. riots were happening just down the road, such violent and even deadly racial tension was impossible for the university to ignore.
It might not be as sever today, but this divide is still illustrated by the racial distribution of persons between the different neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Leimert Park, a few miles southwest of campus, is 74 percent black or African-American, while Boyle Heights — just east of Downtown — has a population that is 92 percent Latino. Caucasians make up 85 percent of the Hollywood neighborhood Beverly Crest, with Asians coming in second at just 5 percent.
These are extreme examples, but almost every neighborhood in Los Angeles has a clear majority of one ethnic group or another. In fact, the University Park neighborhood is one of the city’s most diverse.
Such insular ethnic communities can sometimes act as safe havens for immigrant groups seeking cultural security. Isolation, however, can still create a disconnect between the neighborhood and the rest of the city. Controversy has erupted, for example, over the construction of a Walmart in Chinatown. The company claims that the community wants a large grocery store in the area, but it might not have considered that the community around the neighborhood might have very different interests from those actually living in Chinatown.
The city’s communities don’t have to be so separate. Students should take advantage of the cultural diversity of Los Angeles rather than comply with the lines drawn between cultural and racial communities. There is nothing stopping students from taking a bus to the Lula Washington Dance Theatre on Crenshaw Boulevard to take an African dance class from the woman who choreographed Avatar or from visiting the many Korean barbecue restaurants just a few miles from campus. There is no reason why students should not pay a visit to Little Ethiopia, sample some Armenian fare in Glendale or get to know the vibrant Latino community that characterizes the independent restaurants and small businesses of our very own neighborhood.
The boroughs of Los Angeles have kept people of different cultural backgrounds apart from one another for decades, but they have also fostered incredible cultural resources waiting to be tapped. College is the perfect time to explore the new ideas, hobbies, foods and practices offered by multiculturalism. Take this time to knock down the barriers created by geographical segregation and experience your city.

Dear Ms. Bessey,
After reading through your article, I thought it was extremely eye opening to analyze these relationships. These particular topics are powerful because they are matters that need to be discussed and worked through. We are living in a world where our own prejudices can get in the way and sometimes an unintentional ignorance causes us to make judgements too soon. This could be why students are failing to really take advantage of the surrounding communities in Los Angeles. Students make assumptions about the surrounding areas, failing to understand the rich history and the motivations behind these communities. Instead this creates a racial divide, very similar to the one you have described in your article. 
You mentioned that these neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area have “a clear majority of one ethnic group or another” and these can sometimes “act as safe havens for immigrant groups seeking cultural security.” I think it’s important that we break down these walls and get rid of this need for cultural security because this is what is causing the isolation, the controversy, and the tension among neighboring communities, and especially between the USC students and their direct communities surrounding them. 
Mr. Nemeth raised an interesting point in his comment regarding the phrase “cultural security.” People desire to feel secure and comfortable with something that they currently know, so is this preventing immigrant groups from interacting with one another? The controversy of large developments such as the Walmart in Chinatown is becoming more prevalent as other developments such as the Master Plan are being implemented at USC. As with any gentrification project, groups around the USC area are concerned with the intentions of the project and how those in the community will be included in this project. I think USC is doing an excellent job at getting the community involved, yet I question how this plan will pan out and whether the surrounding neighbors will feel completely comfortable with this. Is this invading their cultural security?
I can agree with you that students are failing to fully engage. Quite frequently, I’ve found myself stuck inside this “USC bubble.” Perhaps I can consider this my own “cultural security,” where I don’t adventure out past the areas that I can and fail to really take advantage of the multicultural delicacies that Los Angeles has to offer. It could be because I don’t have enough time, but it could very well be because of what you mentioned in your article. When describing the realities, you said, “many students are not knowledgeable about L.A. History, which might be a direct result of their lack of engagement with the diverse communities and cultures that are part of this history.” It is important to engage with the community to better understand a broader picture of our world. We are raised on our own beliefs and judgements, but we can’t really form beliefs until we understand the cultures and their motives. I found an article in Forbes that discussed cultural differences and their affects on our understanding. In addition to engaging with the community, I think it is also very important to make a point to openly discuss cultural differences so that a positive benefit can be reached. So, by engaging with out community and discussing the differences that are prevalent, people of different race, ethnicity, and communities can better communicate and understand one another.
I am always interested in uses of the phrase “cultural security.” In this case, “seeking cultural security” may contribute to isolation of immigrant groups and thereby increase the risk of controversy over new developments, such as the Walmart in Chinatown. The article also points out the advantages of exploring and appreciating the diverse communities of Los Angeles. A familiarity with, and understanding of, the cultures of neighboring communities may lower the risk of controversy and thereby create a different type of “cultural security.”

Hurricane Sandy, and the possibility that the natural disaster was linked to climate change, might change some of the presidential candidates’ campaign rhetoric in the final days leading up to election day on a topic that has been largely ignored thus far.
It is startling that the candidates have ignored the issue of climate change, yet at the same time, the exclusion is an unfortunate indicator of how uninformed many Americans are about the importance of protecting the environment.
Throughout the 2012 campaign season, the presidential candidates singularly focused on a variety of issues that they believe the average voter cares about, with the economy and foreign policy often taking center stage while climate change and other issues sat at the margins. The debates were no different: This year’s presidential debates were the first in 28 years that didn’t mention climate change.
And this is probably because most Americans haven’t taken an interest in climate change. In Gallup’s most recent “Most Important Problem Poll,” only 2 percent of Americans said they believe the environment and pollution to be leading issues. Though the presidential campaign nears its end, the next president and all politicians, as drivers of national discourse and, thus, public consciousness of issues, must take a stand for climate change so that the people do as well.
Within the scientific community, climate change and its implications, such as increasingly extreme weather, is widely accepted as fact. Ninety-seven percent of scientists recognize that climate change is happening, according to PBS.
Beyond scientists, the Pentagon also acknowledged climate change in a 2010 report: “Climate change and energy are two key issues that will play a significant role in shaping the future security environment. Although they produce distinct types of challenges, climate change, energy security and economic stability are inextricably linked.”
Despite these confirmations, instead of discussing climate change or environmental policy, the closest either of the candidates got to speaking about the environment in three presidential debates was when Obama and Romney sparred over who loved coal more and who could do a better job at sucking oil out of the Arctic. Another point of contention between the two candidates was Obama’s efforts to establish “green jobs,” or jobs that promote the usage of renewable energy. This discussion, however, was relegated strictly to the field of economics, both candidates trying very hard to skirt the reasons and motives behind creating “green jobs.”
There’s little doubt that Obama accepts the scientific view on climate change. In a 2008 speech, Obama said, “Not only is [climate change] real, it’s here, and its effects are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon: the man-made natural disaster.”
Romney agreed, endorsing the issue in a 2011 town hall meeting: “I believe the world is getting warmer, and I believe that humans have contributed to that.”
Though  they apparently recognize the existence of human-caused climate change, neither candidate has taken a substantial position on the subject this election season.
This is regrettable. When candidates and debate moderators choose to omit certain issues because they are not the most popular topics or not the ones that will help garner the most votes, they limit the sphere of discussion to a narrow selection of issues.
Voters would believe climate change to be an important issue if the candidates, and politicians in general, treated it as such. Ignoring climate change does nothing to prevent it from taking place. Students should be especially concerned, as we are coming of age in an environment that seems primed to face more and more extreme weather on an increasing basis because of climate change.
The arrival and aftermath of Hurricane Sandy might propel climate change into the last week of presidential campaigning. But it will take a fundamental push from Washington to convince Americans that climate change is an issue that requires large-scale action.
 
Matt Tinoco is a  freshman majoring in international relations.
Some of these remarks remind me of how ostriches stick there heads in the sand. Just deny it and it will go away. Nowadays everything has been politicized, even the science supporting climate change. Anecdotal evidence is not evidence at all.
I suppose there are some who still believe the earth is flat and that the Sun revolves around the earth.
The old bag is back!
I heard you had a clue in 1999 but not since, meow!
Our next President needs to address the anti-business climate that is preventing companies, like the one my father owns, to make money and create jobs.  Climate chnage is like 15th on the list of what I think is important.  And I don’t even think it’s happening.  I have lived on 28th Street (the Row) for almost four years.  If anything, it is getting colder!  I used to be able to dress light all the way until late November, but it keeps getting colder and colder and I am now wearing warm clothes in October.  Also, we summer in North Carolina and the water has been cooler these past two summers.  So, try again Matt Tinaco.  Let’s focus on the important issues and leave the make-believe for the kids.
The Row got so cold we moved to 30th
You don’t seem to get how climate change works…
I just look at my coors light can and it tells me if it’s ice cold (or not).
Bro, 
Let’s be more specific, it’s “Cold” or “Super Cold” and not “Ice Cold”
Only the fools will miss him
I figured the silly SCALE kids would be on this story and I was right.  If it’s not one Leftist cause, it’s another.
BTW:  I’m going bear hunting next week with my son and grandson.  If we get one, I am going dedicate non-usable parts of the carcass to SCALE.    You can hopefully use it in your efforts to help people overseas get air-conditioning.   Those Asians apparently love the sex organs for some odd reason.  Maybe you can make a trade?
NEWS FLASH – the president does not control the planet! The climate is not like going through the drive thru where you make the order and everything is the way you like it. The president can encourage lawmakers to make laws to FORCE people in the USA or abroad to change, but they might resist. That resistance might be with weapons. The weapons may not be environmentally friendly. The environment may be destroyed in the ensuing wars. Problem solved? 
If your climate change solution involves FORCE, you may want to rethink your strategy.
“Thank you for the opportunity to review the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Statement of work for the Hurricane Aerosol and Microphysics Program (HAMP). Research scientists and managers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) met in April to discuss research collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on HURRICANE MODIFICATION. OAR firmly agrees that hurricanes pose a significant risk to our nation’s security through the cost of human life and economic property damage.
While OAR recognizes that weather modification, in general, is occurring through the funding of private enterprises…” 
http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/noaa_letter_dhs_hurricane_modification.pdf
Even outside of climate change or weather, consider how many people are now living on the earth compared to the number of people who have ever lived on earth. There were only 2 billion people in 1927 compared to the 7 billion now. That rate of increase is scary. Also consider how people live compared to a hundred years ago: the cars, the manufacturing and industrial debris, trash accumulation, energy usage, deforestation etc. It seems like common sense that these changes would have some effect, whether its climate change per se or not.  For example, we know for a fact that deforestation can lead to flooding and loss of habitats for animals. Why is the idea that it may also affect the atmosphere so hard to believe?
The finger print is on this storm. The Atlantic ocean is 15% warmer and sea level a foot higher due to global warming. Both clearly contribute to how big an impact a storm like sandy is and has and did.
The writer of this article is ignorant of climate science and shows this clearly by trying to link Sandy to climate change. NOAA says there is no link but yet a poorly educated wannabe journalist student  claims ther is one. The climate has cooled in the past decade and yet no climate writers mention it.  Too many young people have not studied science because it is too hard for them so they believe the hype that makes great headlines. It is time for the world to realize that there is no factual evidence that shows there has been any link to human activity and warming of the planet. It is all based on poorly written computer models which happen to agree because they all use the same theoretical parameters as the basis of the algorithm chosen to represent the scientists idea of how the climate works but they all leave out the importance of the combustion energy released by the fossil fuels. Computer models can work but only if they use the known parameters rather than estimates.
If you don’t believe human activity (millions of cars, pumping co2 into the atmosphere, over farming, over fishing, reforestation, digging up coal oil gas ect and burning it… And on and on…) doesn’t have an effect on the planet you’re a fool. You should try going into your garage, turning your car on, and take a nice long nap.
Tanya, just out of curiosity, what exactly is your area of expertise? Do you know the science to back up that claim?
i’m just very observant.
*snickers condescendingly*
lol. The ancient Greeks (most notably Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy) were very observant and thought the sun revolved around the earth. Observation by an average citizen cannot trump scientists who spend their entire lives examining a subject with advanced technology and access to innumerable resources.
For me only God can answer all …
yeah, maybe the next president can send a spaceship to the sun and convince it to stop changing the climate on the earth and all the other planets in the solar system.  man, these reporters are so myopic!
Matt:
Looks like you have a lot more school to go, freshman.  The Earth is cooling.  Which is why the buzz word is now “climate change” rather than “global warming”.  You are probably too young to remember, but in the ’70s, the headline was “are we in the beginning of a new ice age?”  As has been mentioned earlier, no one has been able to quanitify any correlation between human activity and warming.  There has been plenty of correlation between the increased or decreased activity fo the sun and the regular turnover of the oceans (PDO – Pacific Decadal Oscillation & Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation).
According to one of the Parties, there is no Climate Change. (Read the Republican Platform).
I know……… let’s have that debate no one on the AGW side seems to want. i would watch every minute of it!!!
Joe as a scientist on global warming would you mind referencing some of your research?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming
If you look at the scientific community the majority of scientist believe that global warming is mainly cause by human factors.  But what do scientists are listened to when it’s convenient or economically safe.
Which president ? Because if your talking China forget it ,they can care less.
So that being said ,why should we be taxed to death while The second largest economy keeps polluting away.
China keeps polluting because they manufacture at “low cost” for the US markets. The American proletariat has been in China for a while now.
I am a scientist and we do know that climate is changing.  However, we do not know that it is influenced or how much by human activities.   Also, we do not know if  the changes are in fact in any way influencing the apparent recent increase in storm severity.  I doubt that any scientist without an agenda, e.g. funding would say otherwise with any degree of integrity.
One question.  Being that you are a scientist, what is your field of study?
Yeah, the 97% of climate scientists who agree that it’s from human activities based on the evidence are just doing for that extra money they make. The 3% who disagree are living in poverty and shame. If only they could get more funding they could find enough evidence – or at least a little? anything at all – to refute that mountain of evidence. It isn’t as if that 3% hasn’t been unfairly supported by the big oil and coal companies. Nah, they’re out in the streets begging for coins just to continue their research. But they’re on a mission. 
Being a ‘scientist’ doesn’t mean anything. I don’t ask my dentist for advice on possible skin cancer based on the fact that he’s a ‘doctor’.
I am sure it is 97% of climate scientists. Where did you get your data?
As a scientist, you must know then that the climates of Saturn, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Neptune, and Pluto have all exhibited change in the last decade as well!  No humans we know of on those planets!
No one has ever claimed that all climate change is from human activity. And if the supposed change in those planets were due to the same (mystery) factor then their change would have been similar to Earth’s. It isn’t. In fact, none of those changes have anything to do with what’s happening on Earth. Unless you accept astrology, in which case we should just hope the Moon is in the third house by the time Saturn aligns with Mars. Otherwise, we should probably listen to the real climate scientists.
“Though  they apparently recognize the existence of human-caused climate change, neither candidate has taken a substantial position on the subject this election season.”
No, they recognize that there is climate change (as does everyone else), they DON’T accept the notion that it’s the result of humans. You’re the one who added that part…
So who exactly would be responsible for it??
How about Nature. How arrogant of some to think that humans are powerful enough to effect global weather change.
Just a refresher to the young skulls of mush but back in the 70’s we were all told there was a coming ice age.
Your demigod Al Gore has become a multi millionaire on the back of global warming hysteria. I bet he is secretly laughing all the way to the bank because he sure doesn’t live like he tells us we all should. He is no better than Jackson and Sharpton playing the race card.
Matt, your liberal indoctrination is paying off well. You should do well in what passes for journalism these days. No substance. Just a few buzz words and a couple quotes and you are golden.
The Sun!!!
Really? The sun?!  People aren’t powerful enough to effect climate change?? Wow…I can see why we some less fortunate countries have higher literacy rates than America…”Nature”! that’s more than laughable and doesn’t even really deserve the a debate.  It is sad that some honestly think that humans (who are also classified as parasites) have not caused great damage to our earth…You don’t need to like, listen too or even follow “Al Gore” (who is completely irrelevant) to understand that 97% of scientist around the world put mankind at the forefront of this rapidly growing issue.
“we”, “the” within my paragraph are typos…my apologies

Fall is the season for massives in Southern California, perhaps because Halloween is the best excuse to dress more eccentrically than any other time of the year.
Attendees can expect the theatrical productions of each of these upcoming events to be a full-scale show with lights, sound and special effects of quality that surpasses previous years.
The fact that there are three massives in the span of one week — and with similar themes — creates fierce competition among the different production companies. This is good news for attendees, as it means that various tricks and treats are in store for both new and seasoned ravers to enjoy, no matter which event they choose to attend.
In deciding among the seasonal massives, price is often not a factor. Each rave doesn’t vary too widely for a general admission ticket — ranging from around $60-85, including fees and shipping — and many electronic dance music fans are willing to spend some serious cash if the lineup is worth it.
Because of the increased popularity over the last few years in the EDM scene, event prices have gone up. Additionally, as each event is different and has its own following in terms of the types of artists and the reputation it carries, the deciding factor for those without strong opinions or niche genres is often based on the actual lineup once it is released.
The top three Southern California fall electronic music massives of 2012, in no particular order, are:
Escape from Wonderland
Held Saturday, Oct. 27 at NOS Events Center in San Bernardino, this is the most popular massive. Insomniac Events has consistently delivered over the years and has built up a positive reputation in the EDM scene. Because of this, it is the best bet when considering all things — minus the lineup and the location (because yes, it is unreasonably far for most people who live in the L.A. region). For people who haven’t attended Escape in the past, the lineup is interesting and diverse; for those who have been in previous years, most would agree that it looks similar to last year’s sold out show, with a few new additions. Armin van Buuren, recently named DJ Mag’s No. 1 DJ of 2012, has been added to the lineup as of Oct. 19. A multitude of other artists, such as Martin Solveig, Laidback Luke and Thomas Gold, are also set to play. Escape also boasts mazes, art installations and three haunted houses that will add spooky elements to the five-stage production.
Monster Massive
Held on the same day as Escape, Monster Massive is Insomniac’s competitor that often goes head-to-head with the production giant during Halloween. Unlike Insomniac’s tried and true reliability, however, Monster Massive has faced controversy in the past, such as last year’s “Armin-Only” debacle, which led to the cancellation of the entire event with less than 2 weeks left until what should have been showtime. This left many concertgoers with a bad taste in their mouths, although people got their tickets refunded. This year, it has taken a quieter approach with a lower-risk yet solid lineup, including Lil Louie Vega, Frankie Knuckles and David Morales. On the other hand, this year’s venue, L.A. Center Studios, has generated its share of letdowns in the past by allegedly breaching contracts and thus botching shows such as Winterfresh back in 2010.
HARD Haunted Mansion’s Day of the Dead
Though not technically a Halloween rave, Day of the Dead has a similar theme and is set for Nov. 3, the Saturday after Halloween. As the name suggests, the lineup includes exciting headliners, such as Knife Party, Major Lazer, Zeds Dead, Tommy Trash and “MVP of the MPC” AraabMUZIK. It was also recently announced that there will be a new Moombahton stage. The event gets props for stepping out of the box and highlighting different genres and subgenres, and going with the flow of the ever-evolving EDM scene. It might be a hit or miss in terms of the Day of the Dead theme, as it’s something different from the more common yet tried-and-true Halloween theme.
Since most people go to massives for the music, experience and atmosphere, it will be interesting to see how each of these events plays out. Only time will tell, but as of now it doesn’t seem as though there is any shortage of highly entertaining and captivating massives to attend. For excited ravers, now is the time to get working on the wild costumes and dance moves, because it will be showtime for all three events in less than two weeks.

The university announced a $25 million donation from Professor Leonard D. Schaeffer to endow the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics on Tuesday.
Schaeffer, who is a Judge Robert Maclay Widney chair, and his wife Pamela founded the center in 2009. The USC Schaeffer Center, which falls underneath the USC School of Pharmacy and the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, is led by director Dana Goldman, renowned health economist and Norman Topping Chair in Medicine and Public Policy.
Schaeffer said he hopes his gift will allow the center to create more groundbreaking research. In the three years since its dedication, the USC Schaeffer Center has amassed $45 million in research funding from outside sources. Past research from the center has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Politico and National Public Radio.
“Our nation faces grave health and fiscal challenges,” Schaeffer said in a press release. “I support this Center because its rigorous, independent and interdisciplinary research provides the foundation for designing effective policies to address these issues in both the public and private sectors.”
Goldman also said the endowment will help the center further its mission.
“Leonard Schaeffer has demonstrated a life-long commitment to relevant, evidence-based health policy research,” he said. “With this additional gift, he ensures that our mission of providing independent, innovative solutions to today’s health policy challenges will endure beyond the current era of health care reform.”
This donation represents another step toward fulfilling the $6 million fundraising goal set by the Campaign for the University of Southern California.
