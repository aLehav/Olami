The USC men’s water polo team will look to defend its national title at the annual NorCal tournament.
After dominating its first four lower-division opponents by a combined score of 78-14, USC (4-0) will face its first major challenge of the season at Stanford. The 16-team, single elimination tournament is set up so USC will likely play three of its fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opponents over the weekend.
The MPSF is historically one of the best conferences in the country. It’s top nine teams are also the top nine in the Collegiate Water Polo Assocation rankings, and every team in the conference is undefeated heading into the weekend.
The games in the tournament don’t count in the conference standings, but the challenge of facing their conference rivals for the first time in 2012 is not lost on the Trojans.
“It’s good to see what the rest of the competition is like,” redshirt junior driver Stephen Siri said. “[It’s] a good test to see how much we’ve learned and improved over the summer.”
While double headers on the schedule are not rare, the tournament still poses the difficult task of playing four games in two days.
USC coach Jovan Vavic mentioned that the players are being given more rest than usual this week in practice in order to conserve energy.
“We’re going to play them all,” Vavic said when asked if he might alter the Trojans’ strategy for the tournament opener. “But they’re going to play less minutes.”
The Trojans open against Pomona-Pitzer at 8 a.m. on Saturday, a team they beat 20-3 in their second game this year.
If the Trojans can defeat the winner of the Long Beach State-Pepperdine game, a matchup against Stanford likely awaits. The Trojans are the top seed in the tournament, while the Cardinal is seeded fourth.
The Trojans defeated Stanford in three of their four matchups in 2011, but once again the Cardinal provide a challenge the Trojans rarely encounter.
“They’re a big team,” Vavic said. “They have some physical, tall and big players who can create mismatches for us.”
Senior driver Michael Rosenthal agreed with Vavic. “They’re always a team that makes us have to consider our matchups” Rosenthal said. “You go in and you prepare all week for likely opponents, but what you’re really doing is just fine-tuning your defense and offense to make sure everything focuses nicely.”
Though it might be difficult when the upcoming opponents are still unknown, the reason for team’s potential success will be the small adjustments made in practice.
“We do all the work we can before, and then just see where we’re at once we get up there,” Siri said.
As for the biggest challengers in the way of the Trojans’ third consecutive NorCal tournament title, Vavic and his players mentioned conference foes UCLA and Cal in addition to Stanford.
Two of the Trojans’ three losses last season came at the hands of the Bruins, including a 9-10 sudden-death defeat in the MPSF Tourney championship match. The Trojans avenged that loss with a 7-4 victory over the Bruins in the National Championship, but UCLA looks to have little drop-off, if any, from last season.
UCLA scoring duo Josh Samuels and Griffin White combined for 94 goals last season, while MPSF tourney Most Outstanding Player Matt Rapacz returns in goal. The Bruins are 8-0 after the UCLA and Princeton Invitationals, winning their matches by an average of more than 13 goals per game.
The Golden Bears also went 5-0 at the Princeton Invitational last weekend. Cal returns key players in goalie Justin Parsons and top scorer Collin Smith, who has 19 goals so far in the nonconference slate.
The Trojans swept Cal last season after a late goal gave the Trojans a 9-8, sudden-death victory in Berkeley.
UCLA is currently ranked second in the CWPA Polls behind USC, while the Golden Bears come in third.

Perfection has been the name of the game so far for the No. 3 USC women’s volleyball team, which will put its 9-0 record to the test at the TCU Molten Invitational this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas.
Digging · Junior libero Natalie Hagglund has led the Women of Troy to a No. 3 ranking early in the 2012 season. She had 13 digs last weekend. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy, one of just three remaining undefeated teams in the Pac-12, will square off against TCU, Lehigh and Prairie View A&M. USC is seeking its second 12-0 start in the last three years. The tournament will once again feature a round-robin style, as the Women of Troy will draw TCU on Friday night before a doubleheader against Lehigh and Prairie View A&M on Saturday.
The season has been a relative breeze for the team, which has bounded out of the gates to an impressive 9-0 start. After a season-opening sweep in the Texas A&M Invitational, in which it lost just one set, the team collected three more wins as host in the Luxe City Center Trojan Invitational before yet another sweep of the USC Classic tournament last weekend at the Galen Center.
USC coach Mick Haley was still adamant about improvements the team must make, citing the team’s grueling, five-set win against the University of San Diego that started the tournament.
“We made too many errors,” Haley said. “We played a good first game, but then our legs got rubbery. We have to relax and make fewer errors. Our three main hitters contributed 23 points to our opponents in the first game.”
Despite struggling to knock off the Toreros in the first game, the Women of Troy easily beat Cal Poly in straight sets before sweeping rival Notre Dame in the nightcap to conclude the tournament.
Any signs of fatigue seemed to disappear Saturday, as the Women of Troy once again completed a tournament with at least two sweeps. Against Cal Poly, highly touted freshman Samantha Bricio put on yet another impressive show, leading all players with 14 kills.
Fellow freshman Alicia Ogoms, who saw significant action after the team’s tiring opening match, more than delivered, as she recorded six of her seven kills in the final set to help the team complete their sweep. Sophomore setter Hayley Crone turned in 32 assists and 11 digs for her fifth double-double of the season, while junior libero Natalie Hagglund led all players with 13 digs.
The Women of Troy delivered an even more impressive performance in the nightcap, turning three close sets into victories en route to their sixth sweep of the season.
Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller had a banner night, registering a career high 21 kills and capturing tournament MVP honors. Joining her on the all-tournament team were Hagglund and Bricio, whose 12 kills were second on the team. The results were not lost on Haley.
“The team’s fight was one of the most encouraging things we saw tonight,” Haley said. “We just finished. What a great comeback. I thought Fuller was amazing, but we had some great performances from all of our players and our setting was wonderful in this match.”
The TCU Molten Invitational will mark the end of tournament play for the Women of Troy, who will begin individual play against crosstown rival UCLA on Sept. 19 at the Galen Center.

USC coach Ali Khosroshahin says he considers San Diego coach Ada Greenwood to be one of his closest friends — but that doesn’t mean the Women of Troy will be taking it easy on the Toreros in their road match Friday. Especially since the USC women’s soccer team (2-3-1) has lost all four of its matches against the Toreros (3-5) dating back to 2010.
“If you’ve ever competed against your friends, you know that it eats at you when you don’t do well against them,” Khosroshahin said. “There’s definitely a little revenge factor for us here this weekend.”
San Diego acheived its latest victory against USC on Sept. 2 at McAlister Field, where it pulled off a 2-1 comeback win. But since, the Toreros have lost 4-1 to No. 2 Duke and 5-0 to No. 10 North Carolina.
Meanwhile, the Women of Troy are confident they’ve improved in the past couple of weeks, and on Friday, USC will be looking for payback on the Toreros’ home turf.
“We got out of our own heads last time we played San Diego,” freshman midfielder Megan Borman said. “Basically, we looked like we’d never played with each other on the field. These last couple weeks we’ve worked on camaraderie and coming together as a team.”
Last Sunday against Cal State Northridge, the Women of Troy dominated possession and scored a goal late to clinch a tie, ending a streak of three straight comeback losses. Some are pointing to the morale-booster as a turning point for the young Women of Troy, who have welcomed twenty new players to the roster this season.
“We all came out on that field and played hard for each other,” junior midfielder Autumn Altamirano said. “The intensity was amazing. Our tackles and aggressiveness were awesome. The bench really contributed because they were screaming, chanting, throwing off the people on the other team.”
San Diego forward Emily Dillon is the Toreros’ leading scorer with two goals and three assists, and goalkeeper McKenna Tollack has allowed 16 goals while racking up 30 saves in eight games.
The Women of Troy return home Sunday for a match against Portland, in the squad’s last tune-up before Pac-12 play starts next week.
“We want to be prepared for conference [play], having as many new players as we do,” Khosroshahin said. “We’re still developing a better understanding of each other. You can’t bring in as many players as we did this off-season without going through some growing pains.”
USC is 2-2 all-time against the Pilots (4-1-1), but has lost the last two clashes, including a 2-1 decision up north last year. The last time the Women of Troy defeated Portland was in 2007, USC’s national championship season.
Until last year, when San Diego and Pepperdine shared the West Coast Conference crown, Portland had won four conference championships in a row.
The Pilots’ soccer program also boasts some impressive alumni, including current United States women’s national soccer team member Megan Rapinoe, former standout Tiffeny Milbrett, and current Canadian International star Christine Sinclair.
“They’re traditionally a very strong program, and they’ve gotten off to a very good start this year,” Khosroshahin said. “But we like the way we match up against them. I think the kids are fired up.”
Forward Amanda Frisbie leads the Pilots with four goals, while midfielder Ellen Parker has contributed four assists. The Pilots have switched between Erin Dees and Nichole Downing in goal to head a stout defense that’s allowed just two goals in six games.
The Women of Troy kick off in San Diego on Friday at 5 p.m. before returning home for a 1 p.m. start time against Portland at McAlister Field on Sunday.

Following last year’s 56-48 triple overtime loss to Stanford, I thought the Coliseum public address announcer might as well cue the Jaws theme music.
Not fazed · Senior tailback Curtis McNeal fumbled in last year’s loss to Stanford. He rebounded well and ended up leading the Trojans in rushing. – Daily Trojan file photo
After maneuvering his way to the three-yard line in the third overtime, senior tailback Curtis McNeal fumbled into the end zone, and Stanford linebacker A.J. Tarpley recovered the football to seal the win. So, I expected everyone to attack McNeal like the sanguine shark would a carefree swimmer in an inner tube.
In the game, McNeal rushed for 145 yards on 20 carries and scored two touchdowns. His backfield counterpart, former tailback Marc Tyler, contributed a mere three yards on one carry.
But I feared McNeal’s fumble eclipsed those statistics.
Sports culture is littered with heroes and villains. When covering games, sports journalists obsess over defining moments and condensing lengthy games into signature plays, neglecting to mention the countless plays — both made and missed — that brought teams and players to those moments. And fans can’t resist pointing their fingers at the goat.
With McNeal shouldering the entire running attack, it seemed like his game to win — or lose — despite the pre-game billing of a quarterback showdown between Matt Barkley and Andrew Luck.
The notion that one player can lose a football game, however, is ridiculous, because no sport is more team-oriented.
I anticipated that the media would bombard McNeal with profound questions like, “How did it feel to fumble?”
I anticipated that the Coliseum would filter out quickly, with students grumbling that McNeal was not a feature running back on a USC team overflowing with expectations.
Worst of all, I anticipated McNeal would validate this nonsense, lamenting his mistake and apologizing profusely for letting his teammates down.
To my amazement, however, none of this happened. The media was relatively respectful — as much as can be expected, at least. And the Coliseum faithful actually applauded the Trojans’ efforts.
After the tough loss, fans were quick to point out there are no moral victories for USC. But few left the stadium angry.
Most importantly, McNeal responded with uncommon perspective for a young student-athlete.
“I feel like beating myself up, but I just got to keep my head up and keep pushing,” McNeal said following the loss. “I’m going to face worse things in my life.”
McNeal refused to sulk and honor the “Moody” moniker his youth football teammates playfully gave him — the nickname that is now a mere vestige of his former personality. He wouldn’t give reporters the satisfying “money” quote about how nothing could compare to the anguish he now felt.
I don’t need to tell you that scapegoating in sports runs amok. With countless camera angles now at our disposal, everyone can quickly establish who blew his blocking assignment or what led to the quarterback’s pick-six. We’re all coaches breaking down game film.
It’s sad, but inevitable. After all, if college football players couldn’t handle the scrutiny, it’s unlikely they would have made it this far.
Think about it: how articulate and composed would you have been leaving the field after going blow-for-blow with Stanford — owner of the longest winning streak in college football at the time with 16 consecutive victories?
McNeal bravely faced everyone, understanding that mistakes, even ones committed before a sold-out Coliseum crowd and millions of primetime television viewers, are not overcome by brooding.
He’s learned this lesson multiple times.
Growing up in the Pueblo del Rio housing project in South Los Angeles, McNeal witnessed friends and classmates delve into a world of drugs and gang violence. His sister, Sonja, raised him and seven other sibling safter his father suffered a stroke.
In January 2010, USC coach Lane Kiffin was at the brink of jettisoning McNeal from the team. The 5-foot-7 tailback was academically ineligible for the coming season.
Simply put, it would have been so easy for McNeal to devolve into a cautionary tale about wasted talent.
Instead, his experiences have brought him refreshing perspective. He knows the challenges he has faced outside white lines stenciled on grass matter much more.
I’ve never been one for athlete idolatry, recognizing that superior athletic talent, alone, isn’t a quality that deserves admiration. The USC community often piles praise on football players without really knowing who they are as people. But that night against Stanford, McNeal earned my respect as a player and, more importantly, as a man.
Since then, he’s done nothing to change my opinion of him. He welcomed junior tailback Silas Redd to the running back rotation and didn’t complain about his reduced carries in the first two games.
On the Tuesday morning after practice, the media predictably prodded McNeal about the Stanford game once again.
“It’s just football,” McNeal said. “You just have to keep going.”
No matter what happens, the rabid USC fanbase is wise to exhibit similar perspective during the Trojans’ quest for their 12th national championship.

Stanford has never beaten USC four times in a row. But after a 55-21 loss in 2009 and three consecutive defeats at the hands of their Bay Area rivals, the No. 2 Trojans would make dubious history with a loss this weekend.
Grudge match · Sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey leads a unit determined to put an end to USC’s three-game losing streak to Stanford. Bailey had two interceptions in last week’s victory 42-29 over Syracuse. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Given recent contests and the budding rivalry between the two, it’s a reasonable question as to whether Pac-12 opener is weighted with any additional significance for the Trojans. On the surface, USC (2-0) isn’t straying from its “prep, not hype” motto in advance of the highly anticipated showdown at Stanford Stadium.
“Every season’s new,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Every year is different. They have a lot of new people. We have new people. It goes back to preparing really well and getting ready to go on the road in our conference opener.”
Despite this rhetoric, many players admit that winning this game would be more satisfying than an ordinary victory, as the vast majority of the roster has never downed the physical Cardinal.
“It’s definitely in the back of your head,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “You never want to end your career knowing that you didn’t beat a team.” After all, USC’s senior class is 0-3 against the Cardinal.
Without former quarterback Andrew Luck, who in his career terrorized the Trojans defense with his arm and his mobility — rushing for 137 and two touchdowns on 22 carries in three meetings, running back Stepfan Taylor is the Cardinal’s 2012 offensive headliner.
Though quietly operating in Luck’s shadow for most of his career, Taylor is one of the premier running backs in college football, boasting consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons, while often splitting duties with multiple tailbacks.
“They’re going to run to set up the pass game,” said sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, who intercepted two passes against Syracuse last Saturday.
To combat the multiple spread offenses it sees in the Pac-12, USC has re-adjusted the type of defender it recruits, preferring lighter, faster players who can defend in space. These undersized defenders will be tested against Stanford’s more traditional pro-style offense that prioritizes tough blocking up front and running between the offensive tackles.
“I have to be fundamentally sound,” Bailey said. “I have to know where I’m supposed to be, so I can use my speed to my advantage.”
Junior quarterback Josh Nunes — Luck’s replacement — is off to an uneven start in 2012. Through two games, he has posted a respectable four-to-one touchdown-to-interception ratio, but has struggled with his accuracy. The Upland, Calif. native completed a pedestrian 53.3 percent of his passes last Saturday against Duke.
“You’re not going to be the same anytime you lose somebody people talked about as one of the best prospects to ever come out,” Kiffin said. “They seem to have relied on their running game, which is still really good. The offensive line, even though they had a couple of guys leave, is still a really good offensive line.”
On defense, Stanford’s physical and veteran linebacker corps is its most imposing unit. Chase Thomas, a 2011 All-Pac-12 first-team selection, and Shayne Skov, an explosive pass rusher who missed most of 2011 because of a knee injury, will pressure senior quarterback Matt Barkley to release his throws quickly.
Unfortunately for Barkley, USC might be without senior center Khaled Holmes, a three-year starter and his former teammate at Mater Dei High School. The offensive captain exited the Syracuse game on a stretcher after sustaining an apparent ankle injury, and his status for Saturday is unknown. USC does not release injury information, per a new program policy.
“It pushes me more to try to step up and get this line going,” junior offensive tackle Kevin Graf said of Holmes’ injury.
In his absence, the mostly likely candidate to start against Stanford’s tenacious defensive front seven would be redshirt freshman Cyrus Hobbi, a heralded four-star recruit from Scottsdale, Ariz.
“It’s always tough to watch guys go down like that, but we have Cyrus and he stepped up,” Graf said. “I know he’s ready for it if his time comes.”
With the first away game behind them, the Trojans expect fewer distractions and more consistent performance at Stanford Stadium.
“Getting that first [road win] out of the way is big,” Kiffin said. “We always talk about the first time going [off-campus]. As a team, every year is new when we travel and go on the road. Players need to understand our expectations. Hopefully, we play better this week.” Saturday’s game will kick off at 4:30 p.m. and be televised by Fox.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety crime/incident summary on Wednesday, Sept. 12.
 
Crimes against a person
at 1:26 P.m., DPS officers responded to a staff member who sustained a cut above her eye when she tripped and fell while walking near the Watt Hall of Architecture and Fine Arts. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #810 responded. The RA unit examined the staff member then transported her to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.
at 11:20 a.m., DPS officers responded to a student who injured her shoulder while participating in a self defense class. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #13 responded. The RA unit examined the student then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:39 a.m., DPS officers responded to a student complaining of difficulty breathing, a rapid heart rate and muscle spasms after exercising in the Physical Education Building.
at 10:39 a.m., DPS officers responded to the fraternity Lamda Chi Alpha to check on the welfare of a student who was reported to be behaving erratically by family and friends. The student was unharmed when contacted by the officers and they concluded that he was not a danger to himself or others. The officers then cleared the scene.
at 9:19 A.M., Transportation Services personnel immobilized a staff member’s vehicle displaying an altered USC parking permit. The staff member contacted the Transportation Services office, agreed to pay all fees and fines and his vehicle was released.
I didn’t even read this story. But I know it is another euro-bigoted hit piece on those of color.
^^^AGREED!!! That also goes for Feminista. She doesn’t understand that if the DT is using female pronouns, it’s because that’s how DPS reported it based on the FACTS.
Five incidents and only one “he” and that happened to be a frat boy on a multi-day sex and drug bender so bad people called DPS to help find him in his own frat house.  All the rest are silent to the sex of the person or the person was specifically identified as a women.  Where are all the male pronouns?
You are just another male bigot who comes along and telling women what the “facts” are how things are “done” in our current male dominated society.  We are all on to you and your days of dominating women are coming to end!
RE: Staff member with altered parking permit:
So there are no negative consequences if you are caught? Just pay the fees and on your merry way?
What kind of an example is this for students?
It’s like 500 dollars.
@ NUP,
We students have had enough of you and your hippie friends and don’t really care what you think about anything.  Can’t you find something else to do like protesting the UV project?  Maybe one project will go your way some day?
Once again Roundup takes a cheap shot at women!
Here is another journalistic fail from DT – how is tripping and hurting yourself a crime against a person?
Lol!

While the video game industry has expanded in recent years, its growth has been met with some challenges, according to Jack Tretton, the president and chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment, at an address at the School of the Cinematic Arts on Thursday.
Executive · Jack Tretton, president and chief executive officer of Sony, spoke about the changing technology business in his Thursday keynote. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Tretton delivered the keynote speech during a two-day event sponsored by Playstation. The event offered a variety of activities for students interested in the gaming industry as well as those simply passing by.
During the event, Chris Kroger, tool manager for Playstation, said students could use the company’s new move motion controller to play unreleased games or play on handheld consoles. In addition, students interested in owning PlayStation products could also enter into raffles and contests to win PlayStation Vista packs and PlayStation 3s.
Tretton spoke about his own journey through the industry. He offered some information on declining business models and explained how the original PlayStation console revitalized the industry but also how new gamers are continuing to. As gaming continues to expand, Tretton said, it is becoming harder and harder to find someone who has never played a game.
“The gaming industry has never been more fertile, but it has never been more complicated,” Tretton said.
Though Tretton is unsure about what lies ahead for Sony’s gaming endeavors, he said there are many opportunities for independent gamers around the world. Similar to the iOS and Android platforms on mobile devices, Sony manages the PlayStation Network, which provides some of these opportunities.
“[It] allows independent developers to self publish over 300 titles,” Tretton said.
One independent publishing company, thatgamecompany, created and managed by USC alumni, launched a game in March of this year that has since become the best selling game on the network.
Getting an inside look into how PlayStation operates was very valuable, said Michael Francisco, a sophomore majoring in critical studies.
“It was really great getting inside knowledge of PlayStations’ philosophy,” Francisco said. “It also solidified that I would minor in interactive media at the SCA.”
In addition to his work to help independent gamers, Tretton said he has assisted numerous students with the internships available through his company. To date, PlayStation has had about 70 different universities participate in the internship program.
Some students, such as Kyle Grayson, a junior majoring in architecture, said they were excited that Tretton had come to speak on campus.
“I love PlayStation and [when I] heard Jack was coming…[I] had to be there,” Grayson said.
Tretton emphasized the importance of having a vision and committing to it.
“You are the most important product you’ll ever be involved with…. I have a vision and stick to it,” Tretton said.

Once again, as election season draws near, the issue of student financial aid is up for debate. In today’s nation of rising college tuition amid unfavorable economic conditions, the increased need for financial aid — or at least a solution to this costly issue — takes center stage for millions of young adults whose futures might be at stake.
With two months remaining in the presidential race, both the left and right have made student aid a point of focus, most recently at the Democratic and Republican conventions.
In promising to make college more affordable with increased financial aid through the rise in the number of federally sponsored student loans, President Barack Obama has attacked Republican  presidential nominee Mitt Romney for, according to The New York Times, “cutting investments in education” and “leaving one million students without scholarships and reducing financial aid to nearly 10 million.”
In the face of Obama’s challenges, Romney has countered that the president’s policies have yielded a “lost generation” drowning in debt amid a fruitless job market.
Though most students agree that aid is a crucial issue, USC students’ reactions to these two approaches to student aid and the economy run across the board.
“Romney’s solution is more sustainable in the long run and will help us solve this once and for all, rather than to bring it on to the next generation,” said PR Director of USC College Republicans Charles Epting, a sophomore and double-major in environmental studies and geology.
Despite being an ardent believer of little government intervention in aid, however, Epting believes that there are some exceptions.
“It’s fine to have some degree of federal support. Federal grants are a good way,” Epting said. “I myself have government money helping me through college. I’m not against totally against government involvement, but the point is, it’s run wild — it’s run rampant, and we’ve reached a point where we need to start changing.”
On the other hand, junior Catherine Shieh, a political science and urban planning major involved in USC College Democrats, supports Obama’s stances, arguing that federal fund cuts go against the one thing needed for economic growth: the creation of intellectual capital.
“Let’s say that we don’t have those loans or that we reduce the number of loans. Less people are going to college, and how will we continue to sustain our intellectual and creative capital and specialization in a variety of industries? You can’t do that without even getting access to education to begin with,” Shieh said. “The fact of the matter is that though we have higher standards of excellence in education now, we also have higher cost of living, and in pursuing education, and with that sort of problem, what band-aid can we use? I think that would be the expansion of loans.”
And yet for some, neither choices offered in this election satisfy.
Alistair Fortson, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, doesn’t agree with either candidate.
“I think that just in general, people say a lot of things, but then continue to take money out of education. Especially when it comes to public schools. I’d really like to see them get a little more money, because I know for a fact that they don’t receive enough money to do the programs they have, and they’ve got amazing programs in the schools of law, business. I wish the government would do a little more.”
Junior philosophy, law and politics major Taylor Fisher agreed.
“I’m kind of on the fence for Obama and Romney. I think they’re both missing the point that though we have other problems going on in the world, our Cal State schools and UC are still important in getting students an education,” Fisher said. “They don’t understand that raising prices and not allowing more incoming students isn’t really going to help the situation.”
Senior Neaz Kohani, a psychology major, goes back and forth on the issue too.
“I feel like Obama relates to the people a lot better, but at the end of the day, they’re both politicians, so it’s kind of hard to believe either side,” she said.
Students’ opinions do not necessarily run along clean-cut partisan lines. All the solutions proposed may just be temporarily relieving the bigger issue, some students said.
“Obama’s not really trying to fix the problem, he’s just postponing it,” said Christian Aguillon, a senior majoring in economics and communication.
Shieh feels the same way. “Right now, all we’re looking for are Band-Aids — regardless of whether you’re left or right, regardless of the kind of solution you’re looking for. It’s still a Band-Aid,” Shieh said. “The rising cost of education will hopefully become the root of policy conversation, because we can talk about loans all we want, but the fact that they cost so much while cutting education quality is something we must first approach before talking about the finance.”
Junior Lexine Cudjoe, a political science major, argues that the reality of the situation may be less-than-glamorous.
“It’s like choosing the better of two evils, since there isn’t really much of a choice that we’re given in this election,” she said.
i hate usc
I have bad news on this, guys…
Obama sucks on this issue…but Romney sucks hard…like…hard hard. 
Obama’s plan is weak, does nothing to bring prices down, offers a potentially disastrous repayment program.  That’s it.  The lending system is predatory, makes a ton of money for the government, and does nothing more than the students than the old program. 
But Romney…the guy who preaches about cutting spending, cutting spending, cutting spending…and then proposes to dig the old, MASSIVELY EXPENSIVE program out of the garbage can??!!!  WTF??  Where have the real conservatives gone.  They aren’t here. All I see is a bunch of lying, corporate welfare queens.  Its truly disgusting, and true conservatives better get control of their party, and quick, because it’s not going to exist for long with the current cast running the show.  Paul Ryan is possibly even more responsible for this sick joke than Romney, although I can’t say that for certain at this point. 
The obvious, free market, conservative solution is sitting there, waiting to be championed.  Such a shame the Republican’s have been so badly corrupted they failed to see it and seize it.
i hate you

The university recently updated its policies to protect minors on campus from abuse and created a series of awareness programs, The Office of Equity and Diversity announced to all students via email Tuesday.
The new policies collectively formalize procedures on how to react to and prevent child abuse. They detail the reporting process for allegations of child abuse or neglect, as well as the involvement of federal Child Services and law enforcement.
The university also expanded its criminal background check policy so that those who have been convicted of a crime involving a minor are subject to further scrutiny.
“The university is firmly committed to protecting the safety and well-being of minors in its care and on our campuses, such as patients, volunteer subjects of research, sports camp attendees and the children in our daycare and community outreach programs,” Senior Vice President of Administration Todd Dickey said in a statement.
The new “Protecting Minors on Campus” policy says those under the age of 18 must not be left alone on campus, resident students may not babysit minors (including relatives) in their rooms, minors may not accompany students to class, minors must be monitored if they go to work with their parent or guardian and employees should not take sick children with them to work, rather administrators should be lenient in excusing missed days caused by sick children.
Previously, all USC employees were informed that they must report suspicions of child abuse or neglect during their mandatory sexual harassment seminars, which occurred every two years in compliance with state law. The new policy is meant to make those practices official university procedure, according to Dickey.
“Our most recent efforts reflect this commitment by aiming to clarify several policies and practices; many of which were already in place but had not been formalized,” Dickey said. “We believe this will lead to even greater protections for minors across both campuses.”
The Office of Equity and Diversity also urged members of the USC community to watch a series of new educational videos related to protecting minors on campus.
“As members of the Trojan Family, it is our responsibility to work together to promote a campus that is safe and secure for all students, faculty, staff, and visitors of any age,” the Office of Equity and Diversity said.

Executives from Sony, JibJab and Rovio were on hand for the Silicon Beach event this week, which started with a venture competition Wednesday and capped off with addresses from various leaders in the industry Thursday.
Angry birds · Andrew Stalbow, general manager of Rovio, and Lucy Hood, executive director of USC’s Institute for Communication Technology Management, discuss production of applications like “Angry Birds.” – Zhaoyu Zhou | Daily Trojan
 
Notable speakers for the events included Andrew Stalbow, North American general manager of “Angry Birds” creator Rovio, as well as Evan and Gregg Spiridellis, co-founders of JibJab.com, who also unveiled their new company StoryBots at the event.
Evan and Greg Spiridellis focused on topics ranging from the changing dynamics of content production to changing business models to their new venture StoryBots.com.
The Spiridellis brothers made the point that barriers to entry for the entertainment industry have been removed.
“The cost of producing entertainment has plummeted,” the Spiridellis brothers said. “Capital is no longer a barrier to producing entertainment, it’s all about talent.”
They also discussed the need to recognize failing business models and to move to more successful ones as a result.
The brothers called JibJab’s former business model, which focused on producing political parodies, “a crappy business model.”
They discussed how their company moved from their first business model, to one that focused on ecards.
“You make great content around life events,” said the Spiridellis brothers, “and that’s what we do now.”
Their address culminated with the introduction of their new venture, StoryBots.com, a website aimed at teaching toddlers basic education.
The Spiridellis brothers said the reason for creating StoryBots came down to a question: “If Sesame Street were created today, what [would] it be like?”
Stalbow’s address focused on topics ranging from the changing dynamics in the interaction of content delivery and production to the company’s business philosophy.
Stalbow discussed the increasing difficulty of finding a  business model for entertainment.
“It’s hard to build a business model around scarcity,” Stalbow said. “That’s what [Hollywood] fights so hard to protect.”
Speaking on content delivery and production, Stalbow pointed out the two views a business can take on app production.
“An app is just a piece of software, so it can be anything we want it to be,” Stalbow said. “We treat our apps as a service rather than a product, so we are constantly updating.”
Another issue Stalbow said he deals with in his business is the pricing of apps.
“Our goal on pricing is to make it a no-brainer for people,” Stalbow said. “We’ve always put our brand and our fans first.”
The event drew positive reviews from those in attendance; Sergio Pedroza, a senior majoring in architecture and business administration, said he saw the event as a great opportunity for networking and learning.
“This event has created incredible networking opportunities for entrepreneurs. It allows one to get a good perspective on technology, business models and public relations,” Pedroza said.
Silicon Beach at USC was hosted by the Institute for Communication Technology Management in partnership with USC’s Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.
If more of such events can be organized, where eminent speakers are present and where new companies are unveiled, then it is bound to attract more people to such events. I believe that good quality event software should be made available so that people can find out about such events in the days to come.

This April saw the launch of one of the most successful campaigns in the history of online crowd funding.
The goal of the project — recording and releasing a music album — certainly wasn’t anything new to those familiar with Kickstarter, save for one crucial difference. This wasn’t an indie musician trying to pay for some studio time through the generosity of family and friends.
It was underground rock star Amanda Palmer.
A lifelong performer, Palmer first gained a following as one half of The Dresden Dolls, in which she and drummer Brian Viglione rose to prominence on the Boston music scene with their special brand of Brechtian punk cabaret. The Dolls were dark, high octane and definitely not for everyone. The devoted, however, quickly found themselves part of a fandom that could connect with the object of their enthusiasm on an almost unprecedented level.
For Amanda Palmer, reaching out to the fans has always been priority number one, with signings accompanying almost every Dolls show in an effort to build a dedicated and genuine following that looks far more like a community than a cult.
A huge part of that sentiment stems from Palmer’s online presence. In addition to blogging regularly, she utilizes her Twitter feed to greater effect than just about any other artist working in the business. She tweets and retweets dozens of fans a day, asking fans for stories, feedback and, on at least one occasion, took suggestions for various items to incorporate into a song.
When she has time to kill, she’ll announce a spur of the moment “ninja gig” for anyone able to drop what they’re doing and make it somewhere for a quick, free show. Nearly 650,000 fans follow her account, a number that only grows as more people get the urge to plug themselves into her life and experience creative spontaneity on a completely unique level.
It’s not just the music that draws people in; it’s Palmer’s persona. Renowned British author and Palmer’s husband Neil Gaiman has referred to her life as “one giant interconnected piece of performance art,” and he doesn’t seem too far off the mark. Everything she does is about creation and interconnectedness, something that’s never been more apparent than in her latest venture.
For her next album, Palmer decided that she wanted to create music without the influence of big-name studios by utilizing the loyalty of the fans she’d worked so long to gather. After using Kickstarter to fund the five-city “Evening with Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer” tour as a sort of test run, it became clear that the site was a viable platform for the kind of large-scale entertainment endeavors that an already successful musician would want to pursue. Palmer is out to prove that Internet crowd funding isn’t charity, it’s just financing through a pre-order system that cuts out the middleman.
To that end, she created the Kickstarter campaign for her tour, new album — titled Theatre is Evil — and art book filled with works inspired by her music this past April. The project reached its $100,000 goal almost immediately but by no means did things stop there. By the end of May, nearly 28,000 backers donated upward of $1.2 million, making it the most successful music-based Kickstarter project in the site’s history by a $1 million margin.
Since then, the build-up to her album’s release has been a non-stop stream of musical madness that donators have followed every step of the way. About a third of the songs were released online ahead of time, along with a couple of music videos and regular updates on all of the gifts for backers which, depending on the size of the donation, ranged from special edition vinyls of the music to private house parties.
June and July saw Palmer traveling the country with her new band, the Grand Theft Orchestra, for a special Kickstarter tour with two shows per city: one welcome to all music-lovers and another for top tier VIP donators, which featured gallery showcases of all the artwork collected for the art book. Guests at the latter were treated to gift bags, an open bar and a private performance from Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra. More often than not, these would conclude with Palmer stripping naked and inviting fans to cover her in paint. If it wasn’t clear enough by this point, let there be no question that when it comes to her art, she rejects any notion of boundaries.
In this case, it’s a no-holds-barred approach that pays off. While never quite approaching mainstream recognition, Palmer’s success is still everything that a performer could hope for. She has a dedicated and ever-expanding audience that loves and accepts her work enough to support her no matter where she goes.
Through her openness and sincerity, she’s retained the ability to create and express exactly what she wants to while connecting with others and enriching lives.
Perhaps her Twitter bio sums it up best — she’s an “amateur musician. professional party thrower.” With her ever-present legion of adoring fans surrounding her, Amanda Palmer has no choice but to rock on all night long.
And that’s just the way she likes it.

There are only so many mornings that you wake up bloated with Keystone and endless shots of dirt-cheap Black Velvet before you realize there has to be something better.
Bye bye beer · This apple-gin-lemon drink garnished with basil flowers provides a welcome reprieve from typical college beverages. – Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
Perhaps your experience can be summarized by this completely miscontextualized quote from Edgar Allen Poe: “I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge.” Or perhaps you simply want to put down that warm frat-house Coke-and-rum and throw a nice cocktail party for once.
Playing mixologist, though, has less to do with buying a lot of expensive ingredients and more to do with how you use what you already have. Only three questions worth asking exist: What’s the base spirit? What’s the mixer? And do you serve it shaken or stirred?
For the sake of simplicity, let’s examine three spirits: vodka, gin and whiskey.
The best way to highlight neutral-tasting vodka is to be creative with technique. The caipivodka, a Brazilian favorite, makes for a perfect example. This strong, refreshing cocktail takes the national drink of Brazil, the caipirinha, and replaces cachaca — a rum-like spirit — with cheaper, college-friendly vodka.
Take a lime and cut it into eight wedges; toss the wedges into a shaker tin (see below) along with two teaspoons of regular sugar. Using a muddler or other thick, stick-like object (even the handle of a spatula or knife works in a pinch), crush the limes and sugar together to release the citrus juice. Add 1 1/2 ounces (read: large shot) of vodka, a handful of ice and shake vigorously. Serve over ice.
Gin might be more challenging to newer drinkers, but balancing the spirit with sweetness and acidity (as with the caipivodka) leads to some surprisingly pleasant results. Combine two parts gin, one part lemon juice and approximately three parts apple juice; shake with ice.
What you get is a not-too-sweet, not-too-sour drink laced with the intriguing flavor of juniper and herbs from the gin. Add a dash of Angostura bitters — an alcohol-based flavoring common in many cocktails and available at many supermarkets — and you have a libation worthy of The Varnish.
Now try the same concept with whiskey: Take two parts whiskey (Bourbon or rye whiskey work best), one part lime juice and three parts mango nectar. Shake with ice and garnish with a long slice of ginger: Summer perfection, with the woodsy punch of whiskey perfectly mellowed by the mixers.
As for shaking the drink: It’s an essential part of the cocktail, as the process creates an airy, light texture that works to enliven the drink — think of the texture of a frothy margarita. Both Boston shakers and Cobbler shakers work fine and go for as cheap as $10 on Amazon — look up the distinction online to see which you prefer. Honestly, even a medium-sized jar will work as a desperate measure, as long as you have a mesh strainer or other filter-type object to separate the shaken ice from the liquid. Though shaking times differ from person to person, as a general rule shake hard for around 10 seconds for any drinks served straight up and less for drinks on ice.
Though all the previous examples called for shaking, the “shaken or stirred” question applies most famously to a drink that everyone should try: the classic martini, composed of gin and dry vermouth, a special fortified wine with botanicals that add a special complement to the herbal bite of gin.
By the way: Though some turn away the vermouth, a martini isn’t quite a martini without it — a gin-to-dry vermouth ratio of 3:1 works well. As for those who prefer straight vodka shaken with ice … well, you’re just drinking cold vodka.
Silky, refreshing and elegant, the martini celebrates perfection via subtlety and simplicity, a philosophy that will lead any budding at-home bartender well. But perhaps more helpfully, the martini also presents a perfect lesson on when to stir, instead of shake, cocktails.
Forget Bond: Generally, expert bartenders — such as PDT’s brilliant Jim Meehan and Tailor Restaurant’s Eben Freeman — suggest stirring when a drink consists of only spirits, as with a martini. Part of the problem of shaking lies in the inelegant shards of floating ice it leaves behind. Even worse, shaking incorporates millions of air bubbles into the drink, ruining the silky, syrupy texture of a proper martini (or Manhattan, or Negroni, etc.) and making the drink cloudy.
The best tool for stirring? Weirdly, it’s a single chopstick. Use it to keep the ice spinning round the glass with minimal noise for 30 seconds or so, diluting and chilling the drink without incorporating air bubbles or cracking the ice.
As with cooking, crafting cocktails emphasizes basic ratios and techniques and improves with attention to detail and a willingness to experiment. But whether it’s watching Mad Men with martinis or lounging in the backyard on a balmy Sunday afternoon, a good (strong!) cocktail has the potential to take a nice moment and elevate it to a brilliant one.

A taco can undergo a reincarnation only so many times.
Not your average taco · Mondo Taco’s dishes seek inspiration from all over the world, so diners should make a point to try multiple flavors. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
From tortilla varieties to wacky names, the taco looks different in every restaurant that tries to put a twist on the basic food form. Here to compete with the spread of taco innovators is the newly opened Mondo Taco. In a mid-city strip mall that also includes a donut shop and liquor store, the quaint restaurant serves up relatively inexpensive taco treats.
Mondo Taco specifically focuses on letting eaters travel the world through their meals. The menu lets your taste buds sail from Thailand to India, anchored by the common element of the corn tortilla. Twenty original recipes grace the menu along with the option of choosing a taco as a wrap or bowl.
Broken up into the categories of “crawls,” “grows” and “swims,” the menu presents enough variety for everyone from a vegetarian to a meat-lover to a seafood enthusiast. As suggested, the menu presents tacos that include something that either crawls, grows or swims and will soon be plummeting to the depths of your stomach — if you can handle some of the bold, sometimes overwhelming flavors.
The “Afrentina” will hook you on the first bite. As a culinary fact, anything slathered with the delightful, flavorful Argentinean sauce, chimichurri, cannot disappoint. The “Afrentina” doesn’t, holding on to its luscious flavor until the very last bite. Be warned: The juices might flow abundantly from your taco, so stock up on napkins. The soft Moroccan lamb perfectly absorbs the bold flavor of the sauce, making the taco one that will quickly disappear from your plate.
Continuing with the exotic food theme, Mondo also dishes up “El Greco” (“the greek” in Spanish). Chock-full of tzatziki, diced tomato and lamb, the taco proves a refreshing successor to the “Afrentina.” Though not quite as surprising in its flavor, it manages to mesh together Greek food standards into an adventurously yummy taco. The “Holy Mole” similarly plays with popular ethnic flavors, this time playing up the savory richness of the Mexican sauce. Slathered on chicken and then topped with sesame seeds, the sauce fills up your entire tortilla.
For those unfamiliar with the flavors, the taco packs just the right punch for a small dose. But for those who perhaps know the taste of homemade mole, the sauce will probably not impress. A mole chicken dish usually welcomes the addition of a tortilla. To native eaters, the taco also might seem like an easy dish. The same could be said for the “Afrentina,” but the tastes there are still undeniably satisfying.
Unfortunately, not all the tacos reach the same level of deliciousness. Among its other taco peers, the “Thailicious” and its flavors pale in comparison. On paper, the combination of grilled chicken, cilantro, onions and peanut sauce sounds heavenly, but when the taco appears, it looks more like one huge conglomeration of something indiscernible. The peanut taste abounds but stands as the only star of the taco, so after three bites, the taco gets dull. Though opinions might differ on the sauce flavor, the sauce undeniably feels heavy upon the first bite. Tacos, with their various ingredients or with one bomb sauce, should never feel repetitive. Sadly, the “Thailicious” does not keep the bites coming.
Fortunately, other risks on the menu work perfectly. The “Tokyo Shrimp,” with tempura shrimp, avocado and spicy mayo, feels light but filling and smooth yet spicy. The avocado complements the shrimp and the spicy mayo doesn’t overwhelm. The creation serves as evidence that Mondo can cover quite a few bases and really offer the best tastes from different worlds.
You can down your chosen taco with a variety of bottled and canned sodas as well as fresh juices that come in pineapple and watermelon flavors. The interior feels welcoming and homey, and the friendly workers make sure you get everything you might need.
The Mid-City gem might need to make a few slight changes to its menu, but overall, it proves a worthy addition to Los Angeles’ fixation with reinventing the taco. Instead of fighting over exactly what kinds of tacos you want to eat, bring a group of friends to this locale and give everyone a taste of impressively different flavors from around the world. You can even brag that you ate at the “Taj Mahal.”

Nestled in the Hollywood Hills, competing with traffic and signs promoting the Dave Matthews Band across the street at the Hollywood Bowl, The Walkmen kicked off their North American tour at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Wednesday night. A doting crowd of die-hard fans attended — bearded hipsters sipping boxed wine and women rocking out with red lipstick.
Walking tall · The Walkmen adopted professional garb for their concert. For some fans, the band’s new maturity was initially alarming, but The Walkmen’s performance reassured skeptical audience members of their continued edgy style. – | Photo courtesy of Arno Frugier
The setting for such a show could not have been more picturesque: a natural amphitheatre set between trees and hillsides — even a family of deer chose to make an appearance as opener Milo Greene closed its set with the buoyant new single “1957.”
As the main attraction began, The Walkmen’s guitarist Paul Maroon stood alone onstage playing the soft, beautiful intro to “Line By Line,” a track off the band’s most recent album Heaven. The crowd collectively held its breath as the ethereal tune filled the amphitheatre. After a solid minute, the rest of the band entered to welcoming applause.
The Walkmen were quick to tear through four crowd-pleasing songs off their new album, Heaven: “Line By Line,” the harmonious “We Can’t Be Beat,” the album-titled track “Heaven” and “The Love You Love.” The last had ladies wiggling in their seats.
As well-performed as these newer songs were, the crowd was visibly anxious; the latest album, though a statement of maturity for the veteran band, was considered too light-hearted and clean cut for the band’s longtime fans.
The band’s attire did nothing to appease these anxieties. Lead singer Hamilton Leithauser’s dapper suit and skinny tie looked all too polished for a man once known for his angsty, drunken lullabies. The Walkmen, his outfit seemed to suggest, had grown up.
Not until Leithauser trailed in to “Blue as Your Blood,” from 2010’s Lisbon, did the crowd really wake up. Leithauser wailed, gripping the microphone as though at a basement show in 2003 all over again, and the audience goes for a journey through the good ol’ days. As women (and men) let their hair down and the beers and boxed wine flowed, it was evident that the crowd felt nothing but nostalgia.
The Walkmen slowed their set down with “Red Moon,” a beautifully complex arrangement from 2008’s You & Me. That song’s use of horn quartet lead straight into the artful horn intro of “Stranded.” As Leithauser sang, “You don’t want me … you can tell me,” the lead singer plucked the audience’s heartstrings.
Twelve songs into the set, the concert reached its culmination when drummer Matt Barrick started the infamous downbeat of “Angela Surf City.” Within seconds, the audience jumped to its feet in a wave of fervor.
By this point, any of the band’s questioning fans were surely at ease.
Leithauser commanded the audience, belting into the microphone so loudly the nosebleed sections could feel the rasp in his voice and the strain of his vocal cords. Bouncing rhythmically behind his drum kit, Barrick was an absolute source of energy.
The crowd stayed on its feet with 2006’s “Louisiana,” a jazzy number in which couples swayed to the sounds of pianist Peter Bauer clanging away at the keyboard.
By the encore, which drew exclusively from albums dating between 2006 and 2009, The Walkmen reassured fans of their true nature. Though the band members have grown since their days as New York City rabble-rousers, stepping into new roles as family men, they are no less attached to their past work.
The night was a fine display of The Walkmen’s vast and growing catalogue of hits. Their decision not to play what is perhaps the band’s most beloved song, “The Rat,” irked some, but it was impressive to see the band inch just a bit forward in this way.
The Walkmen have proven that they don’t need “The Rat” to validate its sound.

The inclusion of marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples in the Democratic National Committee’s platform is a historic move that continues the Democratic Party’s tradition of championing civil rights. While the economy and foreign policy are emerging as the most important issues in November’s presidential election, providing equal rights for all Americans through the legalization of gay marriage should always be at the forefront of voters’ minds.
The question is not “what happens when the country officially supports marriage equality?” The question is what happens until it does. Partners who have lived together for decades or who are legally married cannot pay taxes jointly, collect social security if their partner dies or share spousal benefits like health care. Civil unions clearly do not do enough to extend full rights to same-sex couples.
Not to mention, civil unions use semantics to excuse the mistreatment and exclusion of gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans. The two might seem like different terms for the same thing, but in practice, a civil union is not a marriage. It carries a wholly different connotation that perpetuates structures of inequality and neglects the rights of a vast population of American citizens.
Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney has denounced same-sex marriage, despite it being legalized under his governorship of Massachusetts. Romney’s website states that, if elected, he would attempt to pass a Constitutional amendment declaring marriage as only between a man and a woman. Romney wants the governing legal document of the United States to keep a segment of society from having the same rights as others, rather than extending those rights.
On the other hand, President Barack Obama has refused to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that allows states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, in future Supreme Court cases. With Obama’s support, the U.S. military’s “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy was repealed last year, allowing openly gay, lesbian or bisexual individuals to serve in the military.
For a while, Obama appeared to flip-flop on the issue of equal marriage, saying in 2004 that he supported same-sex marriage, then supporting civil unions in 2008 until his self-described 2012 “evolution” into someone who publicly supports same-sex marriage. Now Obama, along with a majority of people born after 1980, sees that equal marriage is inevitable for a country that wants its law-abiding citizens to be treated with dignity and respect. Putting gay marriage at the forefront of election issues will ensure that this dignity and respect are protected for all Americans.
Voting for a presidential candidate based on a single, clear issue is not often advisable. Presidents have a wide range of powers and privileges, and voters generally should weigh the positions, past actions and values of a candidate with careful thought and consideration. But gay marriage, as a civil rights issue, is different.
It should be noted that same-sex marriage is most likely to become legal on a national level through a Supreme Court case. If the Supreme Court decides to hear one of the cases related to same-sex marriage, the sitting president should refrain from influencing the justices’ decision. Even if an Obama administration chose not to represent either side of the issue, the justices would still make a decision.
In that sense, Obama and the DNC’s support for equal marriage might seem largely symbolic — a way for one political party to differentiate itself on a hot-button social issue. But it is not merely symbolic of acceptance. It is acceptance.
We live in a democracy where every individual has the right to decide who they want in office. As a whole, our country chooses a leader. People who support same-sex rights do not have to be defined by that viewpoint when they cast their ballots in November. But Americans have an incredibly powerful decision to make about the values of that leader. They can choose a leader who believes all Americans should be treated equally or someone who wants to legislate discrimination on an antiquated issue.

I want gays to be allowed to marry because I will be laughing when the boys in West Hollywood have no excuses to live in a stable, monogamous relationship.  Be careful what you wish for boys!
The issue is a red herring. The election should focus on who is the best person to lead our country and not on any single issue.
It’s Adam and Eave not Adam and Steve!
“It is acceptance”
Young Rachel might want to brush up on her history. The Democrats’ “tradition of championing civil rights” is littered with ugliness like Jim Crow and the KKK that revisionists attempt to pin on the GOP – the party that was founded in part to battle slavery (remember Lincoln?). Beyond that, it’s insulting to people who actually had to fight for real civil rights to imply that gay couples not being able to procure a piece of paper that is increasingly becoming irrelevant is akin to people fighting against sitting in the back of the bus, or not being allowed to eat or shop where they choose. Furthermore, because this comparison trivializes that history, it further takes away from the far more serious economic and foreign policy issues on the table. If the whole gay marriage issue were anything other than largely symbolic, then the civil rights argument might be valid – but it is not.

Though the Democratic National Convention publicly announced its support for same-sex marriage last week, President Barack Obama failed to mention the issue in his acceptance speech. So did Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention the week before, despite publically endorsing the sanctity of marriage.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
Yet to focus on this would be missing the point. Civil unions — or legally recognized partnerships that give  same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples — should be the central focus of the upcoming election, rather than gay marriage.
The history of the institution of marriage is steeped in religious doctrine. Each religion follows its own set of beliefs about marriage, beliefs that should be protected and maintained. Therefore, marriage should stay a religious issue.
The United States, however, believes in the strict separation of church and state. Though this division doesn’t always work well in practice, the government should exercise restraint and allow individual religious institutions to determine whether they will recognize same-sex marriage.
The solution to this dilemma is for the nation and the 2012 presidential candidates to turn to defining and supporting civil unions. Civil unions should be granted to all couples, whether heterosexual or homosexual.
All politicians, regardless of where they stand on gay marriage, should look to create clear legislation on civil unions, which the federal government currently does not recognize. Under the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that defines marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman, states are not required to recognize civil unions, either.
This leads to an ambiguous situation where same-sex partnership is concerned. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, there are only five states that recognize civil unions, but seven more (including California) grant some or most spousal rights to same-sex couples.
Rather than adding to the confusion by implementing civil union laws state by state, the issue must be decided at a federal level so all partnerships, whether same- or opposite-sex, are legally and symbolically recognized.
In many states, such as Texas and Virginia, when a same-sex couple adopts a child, only one partner can be legally considered the step-parent. In the event of a medical emergency involving the adopted child, if the designated step-parent is not present, the other partner does not have the right to consent to medical treatment for the child.
Similarly disastrous situations have cropped up nationwide, and the next president must put an end to them. Such restrictions put children in unnecessary danger and impinge on the basic rights of a family. Under a civil union, same-sex partners would both legally be considered step-parents, who can be there for their child in times of emergency and — more importantly — symbolically, as parents.
Elevating civil unions to a federal level would also have a key impact on equality in employee benefits. As of now, some companies providing medical insurance and other services to employees and their families can deny these services to same-sex families. But under civil unions, companies would be restricted from doing so.
Civil unions are less polarizing than gay marriage and are beneficial for all Americans. They allow those who define marriage as being strictly between a man and a woman to feel that the sanctity of marriage is preserved. At the same time, civil unions extend the rights to same-sex couples that they are currently denied.
In order to lead a country that was built upon equality and rights for all, both presidential candidates must include civil unions in their campaigns to defend the rights of all Americans who support them.

Sorry, no.  Marriage doesn’t belong to religion.  It has existed as a civil institution even before our country was discovered, starting in the Middle Ages.  I think we can say at this point that marriage has more than one definition.  Both straight and gay people will not be so quick to give up the word “marriage” on their certificate.  Having the federal government recognize one definition and the church another is not a disrespect to either, and this certainly isn’t keeping the religious from practicing by their own definition.

For the past couple of years, it seemed that USC was going to ascend national college rankings as quickly as UCLA was doomed to descend it.
Well, the dream has slowed down a bit.
In U.S. News and World Report’s latest rankings of national universities, USC and UCLA have tied for the twenty-fourth spot. This is one spot lower than USC ranked last year, but one spot higher for our cross-town rivals.
While some USC students might be concerned that our lead over UCLA isn’t as apparent as we thought it was, the tie in rankings isn’t a tragedy—by any means. As much as we hate to admit it, UCLA is a great school, with great students and programs. U.S. News consistently ranked them above us for years until 2010.
This year’s ranking is just reminding us that we may need to work a little harder if we really want to come out on top. The road to prestige in the college world is a long one, and no school is going to climb the rankings without occasionally dropping a little too.
In the meantime, however, this year’s ranking will only serve to inspire USC to do better. We’re the school that managed to (almost) change our image from pure rich kid party den to one of the leading academic universities in the world. We’re the school that emerged from a sanctioned football season as the most intimidating team in the league. USC doesn’t back down for anyone—we confront the obstacles in our way.
These new rankings are no different. They will push our school to have better classes, develop more engaging programming, and attract more and more talented applicants.  They will add fervor to our already ambitious fundraising campaign. They will enhance the construction currently planned to make our campus an even more beautiful place to attend school.
UCLA is a great school. But we still really hate to lose to them—or tie them, for that matter. The rankings are thus the perfect reality check, letting us know what it takes to beat UCLA not just on the football field, but in the non-athletic world as well.
USC’s goal of achieving elite status in the rankings has nothing to do with our cross-town rival, which is but one school with which USC competes.  As a private school, USC, unlike the U of C and its several branches, has a majority of students from outside California.  Our larger goal – and focus- should be to rise above our private counterparts.  
This minor setback should spur all of us USC Trojan Family Members to dig deeper into our pockets and give, give, give to Ol’ SC!

American folk legend Bob Dylan hit a milestone Tuesday with the release of his 35th studio album, Tempest, marking the 50th anniversary of his eponymous debut album in 1962.
With his signature rasp and sociopolitical lyrics, the 71-year-old Dylan has long been one of the most influential people in popular music and culture, and he shows little signs of slowing down on his latest work.
The album has enjoyed a positive reception from music critics with an aggregate score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, earning it “universal acclaim” by the review-tracking website’s standards.
In his five-star review for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes called Tempest “the single darkest record in Dylan’s catalog,” noting the several tracks on the album that center themselves on themes of death and destruction.
The nearly 14-minute long title track serves as a modern-day epic, meditating on the sinking of the Titanic in 45 powerful verses. “Roll On, John,” the album’s closing track, is a heartfelt eulogy for John Lennon, with Hermes noting that here Dylan sings with a shade of “survivor’s guilt…a reminder that Dylan now stands virtually alone among his 1960s peers.”
In her review for Pitchfork, Amanda Petrusich writes that “death – mass death, helpless death, inevitable death – is the real story here, and Tempest, for all its detours toward sadness and alienation, is very much a record about The End.”
While the album’s title sparked rumors that it would be Dylan’s last because of its similarity to the title of Shakespeare’s final play, The Tempest, along with the album’s overarching focus on death, Dylan dismissed the suggestion to Rolling Stone: “Shakespeare’s last play was called The Tempest. It wasn’t called just plain Tempest. The name of my record is just plain Tempest. It’s two different titles.”

Omar Oraby, 7-foot-2 junior center,  has decided to make a verbal commitment to transfer from Rice to USC. Oraby intends to enroll in classes on Friday and start classes on Monda. He also plans to seek out a hardship waiver so he can play this season.
A hardship waiver helps grant a person an exception to a rule due to special circumstances. If the waiver is not granted, Oraby will sit out this season and have two years of eligibility starting in 2013.
Oraby, a native of Egypt, set a school record with 54 blocks last year as a sophomore. He averaged 6.0 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks in 11.6 minutes per game. He announced last week that he was planning to transfer, and visited USC earlier in the week before committing on Wednesday. He also considered UCLA, URI and Ohio State, according to Jeff Goodman at CBS Sports.
“I want to thank Omar for his contributions to Rice basketball over the past two years,” Rice head coach Ben Braun told the Houston Chronicle. “I want to wish him the very best in his future endeavors.”
Oraby will likely take the scholarship vacated by guard Maurice Jones, USC’s leading scorer last season with 13.0 points per game, who was dismissed from the Trojans on Sept. 1 due to academic ineligibility. Even though USC announced that Jones could return to the team in 2013, Jones announced on his Twitter account that wishes to transfer.
