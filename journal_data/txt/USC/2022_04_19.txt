When Jimena Sandoval started her transition in Boston, she was able to attend weekly mental therapy and counseling meetings. But upon her move to Los Angeles, she noticed a clear discrepancy in care for transgender community members. Provided only with prescription refills, Sandoval was left to sift through the complicated medical information and the heavy emotions associated with transitioning. Now a peer support and social media specialist at The TransLatin@ Coalition, Sandoval hopes to provide community members the support she lacked.
Keck Medicine of USC will now partner with the coalition, the largest trans-led nonprofit organization in L.A., to “streamline the development of health care services that address the varied needs of the transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse community,”  the school announced in a press release March 31. The collaboration emerges alongside the development of Keck Medicine’s Gender-Affirming Care Program launching in June, which will provide a range of gender-affirming primary care and transition-related services for gender-diverse patients.
The partnership will play a role in the expansion of counseling services, education and training opportunities and community engagement for the Gender-Affirming Care Program. According to Dr. Laura Taylor, medical director of the Keck Medicine Gender-Affirming Care Program, Keck Medicine aims to close the gap in healthcare coverage for the vulnerable trans-Latinx community in Los Angeles.
“By partnering with The TransLatin@ Coalition, we really hope to add the community voice to what we are building to make sure that we are addressing needs in the right way for the local community here,” Taylor said. “We hope to also more directly reach the community.” 
The TransLatin@ Coalition advocates for the specific needs of the trans-Latinx community in the United States through activism, economic and occupational support and resources for community members.  Sandoval sees the partnership with Keck as a “huge step” for transgender medical care.
“We’re gonna be able to have integrated health services all in one place. It’s so hard for us because it’s not just cosmetic surgeries … these types of surgeries actually save lives,” Sandoval said. “For us, it’s something that’s needed — to have a place with access to most of the treatment, care, surgeries that we need in order to have a better quality of life.”
Taylor understands the urgency of developing healthcare programs for transgender patients, especially considering the unique challenges gender-queer individuals face in the medical world.
“Broadly in the U.S., transgender and gender non-conforming folks face huge disparities when it comes to health care,” Taylor said. “Everything from getting preventative care in a respectful way, getting health insurance, because of so many social barriers that people face like job discrimination and legal issues.”
The necessity for trans-focused healthcare reaches beyond gender-affirming surgeries. According to the Center for American Progress, transgender people suffer from more chronic health conditions and experience higher rates of substances abuse, mental illness and sexual and physical violence, which has only worsened since the coronavirus pandemic began.
“Transitioning is a shocking way of claiming your identity. First of all, everything will be against you — systems like education, work, even finding a job is hard, and you’re limiting yourself to be filling the shoes of what society expects you to be as a transgender individual,” Sandoval said. “It is very important that you’re given the tools to understand not only the internal conflict that you have but also to empower what the future will bring.”
Sandoval said her experience as a transgender woman was made more complicated by the stigmas surrounding queerness in the Latin American community.
“​​You shouldn’t be transitioning by yourself. This is something that is pretty heavy to deal with,” Sandoval said. 
The Gender-Affirming Care Center will provide an extensive network of services centered around transgender health concerns, including gender-affirming surgical care, hormone therapy, mental health care and sexual healthcare.
“This is one step to bring folks to the table and hear their voices and have them at the drawing board,” Taylor said. “We need to serve the community, but systemically and societally, we still have huge strides to make in order for there to be equity for trans folks, same with immigrants, same with folks who face language barriers.”
Keck Medicine also aims to diversify their workforce by hiring from the trans-Latinx immigrant community and educating its medical trainees and staff on the needs and experiences of transgender individuals.
“We hope that kind of knowledge, wisdom and on-the-ground presence provided by The TransLatin@ Coalition will help our patients,” Taylor said. “Ultimately, we’re really excited about building our program, about this partnership and how we will serve the community well in a way that it hasn’t been before.”
The TransLatin@ Coalition urges transgender community members in need of assistance to reach out via phone or to reach out via their website and social media for validation and more information.
A previous version of this article referenced Keck Medicine of USC as the Keck School of Medicine of USC. The previous version also named Dr. Laura Taylor’s title as medical director at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. Taylor’s title is the medical director of the Keck Medicine Gender-Affirming Care Program. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

With the topic of climate change and energy availability on his mind, USC alumnus Gary Buntmann wanted to collaborate with the University to address the issue through expert input and innovative research on renewable energy technology. To do so, Buntmann and Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis C. Yortsos began to “kick around” the idea of fostering a space for new ways of thinking about the sustainable future of energy.
This would manifest itself in the Ershaghi Center for Energy Transition, launched by the Viterbi School March 30. The center will assist in research and educational initiatives to find viable solutions for the transition from hydrocarbons to renewable energy.
The center received an endowment from Buntmann, who said he believes the initiative requires grassroot efforts at USC to lower the world’s carbon footprint. Buntmann’s initial concept primarily focused on petroleum engineering but soon expanded to an endeavor to reduce the world’s carbon emissions.
“The idea here is that we still need to have energy for the industrialized world, but how do we do it in a way that doesn’t compromise the planet’s climate worldwide?” Buntmann said. “That was really the push behind how we do this, and we back it up from a scientific standpoint.”
Yortsos explained energy transitions, such as the move from wood to coal, followed by the shift from coal to petroleum, have changed based on the development of technology and energy demand over time. As the dangers of climate change become increasingly apparent, Yortsos said the call to move away from fossil fuels has also gained momentum.
“The question is, ‘How can the world move its energy system toward a more renewable form of energy?’” Yortsos said. “That will require a transition period, given the fact that it affects tremendously all kinds of different aspects of our economy.” 
As part of their key goals, the center invites various faculty experts to tackle the question of moving global economies toward renewables while maintaining viability and ensuring jobs. The center aims to simultaneously investigate multiple solutions and improve their collaboration with one another. Additionally, efforts to provide seed funding and doctoral fellowships are underway for graduate students who submit proposals on topics they believe currently need focus.
“The center will not only provide seed funding to get the faculty started but will also put a panel of experts depending on the topics that the faculty is interested in and provide the mentorship necessary,” said Iraj Ershaghi, a professor of petroleum engineering whom the center is named after. “The hope is that we help individual faculty who receive these seed funds to submit proposals, expand their activities and become interested.”
The center also looks to engage those outside of the scientific field who can assist in the center’s developments. Although the solutions to energy transition are science-based, Ershaghi said their successful implementation includes various factors of society. One of the greatest concerns surrounding technological developments is their economic viability.
“One purpose of the center is, ‘What are some of the technologies that we can work on and then come up with new processes and new solutions to reduce the costs?’ Because obviously, if the cost becomes too expensive, nobody wants to use it,” Ershaghi said.
Ershaghi said he believes it is of significant interest to have outside collaborators, such as those directly involved in the energy business. So far, the center appears to have numerous outside supporters, Ershagi said, as companies, including Chevron, have already offered the center their assistance. 
“We are right now working with other companies to get their participation, because it’s important. It affects everybody.” Ershaghi said. “Energy is fundamentally a commodity that the availability of it and at prices that are affordable are of significant interest to everybody.”
In addition to outside collaborations, the center plans to include students, both inside and outside Viterbi in its research and proposals, Buntmann said, due to the multidisciplinary resources and knowledge schools across the University offer. 
“There are numerous different messaging areas within the University that are going to be involved in this center, that I see being able to facilitate the science behind it and educate people as to how this center creates energy transition and educates those who are going to be able to implement it on a for-profit and nonprofit basis,” Buntmann said.  
Communication and public policy also come into the mix when the center handles its proposals, Buntmann said, as the public’s support and understanding of technological solutions and the protocols for implementing new energy modes must be considered in the planning and development of renewable energy technologies.
“We’ve talked about the Price School, there on campus, getting involved in the messaging part of it, and so I see it being a collaboration of not only the science part in the engineering school, but also the messaging part around campus,” Buntmann said. 
While he acknowledges the value of communication and education about the science and engineering within the center, Buntmann said he believes students from multiple academic fields can also benefit and thus, aid the planet as a whole. 
“I’d really like to see students involved and it’s really up to the center to recruit these types of minds to get involved in something like this … to make this go full circle and make this be successful,” Buntmann said.

Yellowstone National Park hosted more than 4.8 million visitors in 2021, hitting its highest recorded number alongside 44 other parks. Although several facilities closed because of the pandemic, reopening national parks resulted in visit spikes as millions of people sought relief and solace in the outdoors. 
UC Hastings College of the Law Emeritus professor John Leshy hones in on this subject and the history of American public lands in his book, “Our Common Ground.” Although several books have been written about primary federal land agencies, “Our Common Ground” is the first comprehensive look at America’s public lands in half a century and explains the political decisions that led the United States to hold one-third of the nation’s land for conservation, recreation and education.
To kick off Earth Week, the USC Office of Sustainability, Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate Student Government and Gould School of Law hosted a book release event for “Our Common Ground” Monday in the Musick Law Building. Leshy, who also formerly served as the U.S. Department of the Interior solicitor, presented on his book’s major themes and lessons to an audience of more than a dozen students, many of which were law students. 
Brandon Kerns, a second year student studying law who serves as the president of the Energy and Environmental Law Society, helped organize the event.
“For law students, environmental law is so broad,” Kerns said. “It’s important for students to get exposure while they’re in law school because once you start your career, oftentimes, it takes many years to get to a place that you want to be.”
After a brief introduction by Robert C. Packard Trustee Chair in Law Robin Craig, Leshy began by explaining that the U.S. government currently holds more than 600 million acres of land, equivalent to nearly four times the size of France. 
“In my way of thinking, America’s public lands are one of America’s greatest institutions,” Leshy said. “Their reach surprises many, given that our culture has always celebrated private property and distrust of government, particularly the national government.”
“Our Common Ground” primarily focuses on public land history during and after the 1890s, when Congress began creating political decisions to safeguard America’s land for broad conservation purposes. However, Leshy acknowledged that foreign countries acquired the land from Indigeneous people, who experienced a long history of suffering and unjust treatment.
Leshy then delved into common myths surrounding public lands, including the misconception that public lands have divided American life. Leshy pointed to colonial times, when some colonies gave up their claim to Western lands to settle disputes preventing the national government’s ratification.
“From the very beginning of the nation’s existence, the public lands have tended to unite rather than divide in American politics,” Leshy said.
Another common myth is that public land policy is a partisan issue, Leshy said. Historically, both the Republican and Democratic parties have supported protecting public lands as sites of “life-changing encounters with nature” and rich cultural and scientific resources. 
Leshy’s emphasis on unity struck attendee Katherine Sims, a second year student studying law.
“It seems like from Professor Leshy’s book, he describes a more optimistic view of bipartisan consensus around protection of public lands,” Sims said. “That was cool.”
Leshy also explained that contrary to the belief that decisions over public lands have been “land grabs” by the national government, grassroots movements, such as California activists urging government officials to protect the Yosemite Valley in the 1860s, have often driven public land policy.
Much of the public favors more, better protected land, Leshy said. He told the audience he sees public land policy restoring some trust in the political process in an increasingly distrustful and polarized political environment. 
“Because these lands reflect what the vast majority of Americans have sought, the result, I think, is widely considered as a political success story, showing the political process working as it’s supposed to,” Leshy said.
Leshy said public lands can bring more attention to issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss.
“They furnish vivid demonstrations of the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss,” Leshy said. “They help sound the alarm, arouse public opinion and stimulate new political action.”
Leshy concluded the event by underscoring the lessons the public land system can provide for successfully combating the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. 
“Dealing effectively with these challenges requires a frank acknowledgement that society’s collective interests must outweigh shorter term, narrower interests,” Leshy said. “American public lands are a great example of where our political system has over and over again tried to do just that. One could argue that public lands represent some of the best thinking and acting for future generations.”

After meeting junior Stefan Dostanic, you might not guess that he’s a nationally ranked athlete. His relaxed posture and enduring smile feels familiar and his friendly, laid-back demeanor can easily make one forget they’re speaking with the fourth-best player in all of collegiate tennis.
But if you saw him on the court, you’d have no doubt. As his teammates can attest, Dostanic carries a completely different energy on-court propelling his run up the ITA ranks this season.
“Dostanic is very laid back off the tennis court,” said his doubles partner, senior Bradley Frye. “Then, when he’s on the tennis court, it’s like this switch is turned on; he just becomes this badass tennis player.”
Dostanic currently leads all ITA-ranked Division I players in total wins with 33. USC Head Coach Brett Masi expressed his appreciation of Dostanic’s success, even going as far as to say that a player such as Dostanic can be counted as an automatic point on the board against most teams.
While the junior certainly makes it look easy, Dostanic’s process is far from it. His success can be attributed to his relentlessly disciplined work ethic, a trait that long precedes his tenure as a Trojan.
Born in Irvine, California, Dostanic first picked up the racket when he was five years old. He played tennis — along with basketball and soccer — for most of his childhood. But by his freshman year at Woodbridge High School, he wanted to focus on tennis, drawn to the independence the sport offered.
“I think something that made it special for me was the individualistic part about it… I just really liked how in tennis, it was really just myself out there on the court,” Dostanic said. “I didn’t have to rely on my teammates to win or lose, it was just make or break with myself.”
It’s safe to say Dostanic is more familiar with the “make” portion of the expression. 
In a 2018 interview with the Orange County Register, Ryan Sabado, Dostanic’s high school coach, called him a “perfectionist” — quite the appropriate title given the season he had just completed. In his junior year at Woodbridge, Dostanic went 78-0. Not only did he go undefeated, but he didn’t lose a single set all season.
After capturing singles titles in the Pacific Coast League finals, CIF Southern Section championships, and the prestigious Ojai Tennis Tournament, Dostanic decided to take his senior year off and prepare for collegiate tennis. 
He credits this gap year, along with the team-first nature of high school tennis, as having prepared him for success at the next level.
“That year was probably one of the most productive years I’ve had,” Dostanic said. 
The then-17-year-old would train for around five hours per day at the U.S. Tennis Association facility in Carson, California, on top of maintaining a full online course load. As the prestigious Kalamazoo tournament drew nearer, this number increased to seven hours per day, not including the three-mile run Dostanic dubbed his “lunch break.” 
Dostanic credits this “one last big push” for his immediate success at USC. However, his journey to becoming a Trojan started much earlier, even before he had played in his first high school match. 
Dostanic grew up close friends with Colter Smith — son of former USC Head Coach Peter Smith — and played alongside him for two years at USC before Colter transferred to Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Having grown up close to the Trojan family, Dostanic saw USC up close for the first time and knew it was the place for him. 
“When I was like 12, 13 years old, I came to some USC-UCLA matches, and I saw the campus and just kind of knew it was where I wanted to be,” Dostanic said. “I committed right away to SC, I didn’t really talk to many colleges.”
Dostanic’s freshman year saw the newly-hired Masi inherit a stacked roster of competitors led by junior Daniel Cukierman and senior Brandon Holt. 
The Trojans boasted five ITA-ranked players and a No. 5 ranked doubles squad, launching them to a three-week run as the No. 1 team in the nation that year. Dostanic had pulled together a six-match win streak, and the Trojans were poised for a national championship — everything was looking up.
Then, March 2020 rolled around. Coronavirus lockdowns shut down nearly every major event around the world, and college tennis was not spared. Dostanic and the Trojans saw their season canceled before the postseason had even begun, losing their chance to play on the national stage.
“It was pretty devastating. Myself and the team knew that we were the best team in the country,” Dostanic said. “And then when Holt didn’t come back the next year, we knew that was a big loss for us. It just felt like a missed opportunity.”
Dostanic had big shoes to fill — and he did. 
Ending the season ranked No. 98 in singles, Dostanic tallied an overall record of 21-3, defeating six ranked opponents along the way. The most impressive aspect of his sophomore season, however, was his doubles performance. After a bumpy start together the year before, Dostanic and Frye ended the 2020-21 season with an overall doubles record of 17-1.
“Our chemistry overall has gotten so much better,” said Frye, recalling their 8-7 start in Dostanic’s freshman year. “I think that has also come from us just growing together. And, I’d say we’re really good friends and we do lots of stuff off the court, which then correlates how we act together on the court.”
Dostanic hasn’t forgotten what happened in 2020 and sees this year as his chance for a title run. Currently ranked No. 4 in singles and No. 12 in doubles with Frye, neither an NCAA singles or doubles title would seem far-fetched for the junior. 
“We’re really hoping for a Pac-12 championship, and I really think this team can do some good stuff in the NCAA tournament as well. Make a deep run there, for sure,” Dostanic said. “And for myself, my goal is to try to win NCAA in individuals and also in doubles.”
While many know USC Athletics for the history of the iconic football team, men’s tennis certainly carries its own legacy. With 21 national championships, 15 singles champions and 21 doubles titles, the team room alone can be a bit intimidating to newcomers. 
Regardless, Masi believes Dostanic has what it takes to earn his place on the wall.
“If you look around this room, the success slaps you in the face pretty quickly. It’s around you. And it’s tough sometimes for players, but he handles it really well,” Masi said. “He wants to be one of the key people that are on this wall, and he eyes that every single day. He wants to be one of the best players in the world one day as a tennis player.”
Titles and accolades aside, Dostanic is just a kid that loves the game. He can’t quite imagine his life without tennis, saying it’s this passion that pushes him onto the court every day.
“I got to choose which sport I wanted to play, and I think that was big for me. I wasn’t just brought up playing only tennis, but I played many other sports and I got to see what it was like to be on teams, and I was just drawn to tennis,” Dostanic said. “I think I still have that same kind of love for the game and passion, and I’ll keep playing as long as I have that.”

Women’s lacrosse is on a roll this season with an 11-3 overall record and 7-2 conference record. As the regular season comes to a close and the Pac-12 Championship approaches, here are five fierce players to look out for.

Leading her team in goals this season with 43 and overall points with 47, Kelsey Huff certainly continues to make an impact on the team. The 2022 season marks Huff’s fifth season on the team and second as team captain for the Trojans. 
With 161 overall goals under her belt, Huff has become a notable player in the record books. Of the USC lacrosse career leaders, the team captain holds outstanding statistics in almost all categories. This includes 161 goals, 24 assists, 92 ground balls and 60 caused turnovers. Most recently, Huff  was awarded Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. 
Huff dominates the field and presents an undeniable force to be reckoned with as postseason play comes around.
Redshirt freshman attacker Isabelle Vitale
Despite this being Isabelle Vitale’s first season on the field, she has earned herself a starting spot and leads the team in assists with 19. In USC’s most recent games, Vitale recorded her fifth-career hat trick against Colorado and had five points (2 scored, 3 assisted) versus Oregon. She’s proved to make an impact on the Trojans’ matches, with 25 goals and 23 assists on the season. 
Vitale has always been one to watch, as she was seen on the United States Lacrosse Magazine’s Top 25 High School Players to Watch during the 2020 preseason and the 2020 Inside Lacrosse/ILWomen Power 100 Incoming College Freshmen. 
This seems to be only the beginning of Vitale’s show. 
Redshirt junior goalie Kait Devir
Debuting in her first season, Kait Devir has proved her worth at USC with her execution this season. The starting goalie has 90 saves on the season. Devir has also racked up 27 ground balls and two caused turnovers alongside her saves. 
Devir earned back-to-back Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week awards for her performances in the Trojans’ first three games of the season in February.
Devir transferred from Boston College to USC after the Eagles won the 2021 NCAA Division I Women’s Lacrosse Championship and has used her experience working with titleholders to help the Women of Troy this season. 
Sophomore attacker Claudia Shevitz
Claudia Shevitz has proved to be multi-talented on the field. The sophomore attacker leads the Trojans in draw controls this season (56) and has also earned 26 points for her team this season (21 scored, 5 assisted). She opened the season with 12 draw controls against San Diego State and has had at least one in every game. 
Her success on the draws puts the Trojans in a better position to score each time they gain control of the ball. Without a strong draw player such as Shevitz, USC would be left to rely on its defense alone to cause a turnover to the ball. 
The sophomore starter has become a vital part of the team since her freshman year, where she also played in every game. 
Graduate student defender Lizzy Wagner
After five years of playing for the Trojans, Lizzy Wagner has deservingly earned her way to the top. The team captain has started in every game since her sophomore season and has helped lead the defensive end. Wagner has acquired 25 ground balls and 16 caused turnovers for USC in the season. 
In the Trojans’ most recent game against Oregon, Wagner added three ground balls and two caused turnovers to her record. 
With the Pac-12 Championship around the corner, Wagner and her crew will have to continue their work if they want a title under their belts.

 No. 19 women’s tennis finished its season at Marks Stadium Friday with a 4-3 win against crosstown rivals No. 15 UCLA.
     This was the first time the Trojans beat the Bruins in a conference match since 2017 marking their seventh straight win.
     After being in danger of falling under a .500 winning percentage late last month, USC rallied back finishing the season with a 17-10 overall record and 7-3 in Pac-12 play. The team will also be getting a bye week in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament, locking themselves into fourth place in the league standings.
     Head Coach Alison Swain stated the team’s mindset contributed heavily to their latest win streak. 
“What we’re looking at now is a team that has really grown as competitors throughout the season,” said Swain in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They know they’re tough because of what they’ve been through.”
Seniors Danielle Willson and No. 42 Salma Ewing were honored with a celebration prior to the season finale against the Bruins. 
USC opened the points early on court two as the duo of No. 732 sophomore Naomi Cheong and freshman Grace Piper defeated the No. 56 ranked pair of freshman Ava Catanzarite and junior Abbey Forbes, 6-4.
The Bruins then matched the Trojans with a victory on court three after Willson and No. 98 redshirt freshman Snow Han fell to No. 120 freshman Kimmi Hance and junior Sasha Vagramov, 7-6(6). 
The doubles point would all come down to court one as No. 6 junior Eryn Cayetano and Ewing went against UCLA’s No. 49 ranked duo of senior Elysia Bolton and freshman Elise Wagle, who had won six in a row coming into the day. Cayetano and Ewing were ultimately able to score a 7-6(7) victory to give the Trojans the opening point. 
USC kept it rolling in the singles matches, as Cheong was able to give the Trojans a 2-0 advantage after her 6-1, 6-3 victory over Wagle. Han followed up by defeating Vagramov 6-3, 6-0. 
The Trojans were up 3-0, but the Bruins would not go out without a fight. 
After getting blanked in the opening set, Hance scored UCLA’s first point after defeating Piper 0-6, 6-4, 6-1. Sophomore Vanessa Ong continued the momentum for the Bruins as she beat Willson 7-6(2), 7-5 in a close
back-and-forth. The score would then be tied up at three apiece after Bolton came back from losing the first set and defeated Cayetano 2-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
The final point came down to court one as Ewing went against Forbes — last year’s
Pac-12 Women’s Singles Player of the Year. On senior day, Ewing wouldn’t let up and defeated Forbes 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 to win the match for the Trojans. 
Swain shared that Ewing had to take risks in order to close out the match.
“She really had to play aggressive tennis to finish points because of the style of her opponent,” Swain said. “She just did an excellent job of sticking to her routine and playing her tennis.”
Although the book on the season isn’t closed yet, Swain only had good things to say about the resilience USC has displayed throughout the season. 
“I’m very proud of this team for staying united and staying focused through those bumps in the road in February and early March,” Swain said. “The way we’re playing right now is a product not only of our wins in the past, but also of our losses and the work the girls have put in.”
The Trojans will now head to Ojai for the Pac-12 tournament set to begin Wednesday. USC will face off against Arizona State Thursday.

Is it just me or did this semester fly by?
It felt like spring break was just yesterday, but now we’re already two weeks away from the end of classes. What even happened?
Now that I think about it, I’ve probably just been so caught up in my coursework to really notice the months change. I’m sure we’ve all experienced moments when we’re so focused on the assignments at hand that we tune out the rest of the world. 
In my case, I’ve also had the added stress of being extremely close to graduating, which means all my classes deal with advanced content that requires a great deal of effort to understand.
Not that I’m complaining, it’s natural to progress from simple concepts to complex versions of them as your understanding of a certain area grows. That is certainly the case for academia, but it also applies to most things in life, including video games. After all, putting hardware limitations aside, it would be weird for games nowadays to look and play the same as they did back in the ‘80s. 
While this progress is obviously for the better, I can’t help but feel as if certain games get too caught up in these new mechanics. A clear example of this is the so-called “clicker games,” also known as “idle games.” 
After developers understood that gamers found clicking satisfying, they took it to the next level and made that the only mechanic present in the game. The result was games such as “Cookie Clicker” and “Adventure Capitalist,” where players click one or two buttons without any reason or goal in mind. Worse, it doesn’t take too long for these games to automatically click for you either, taking away the sole venue of gameplay. 
Even putting those games aside, it doesn’t take long to find other examples of recent formats that rely on one or two gimmicks to keep players returning. Gacha games, the topic of an early column of mine, are notoriously known for their addictive tactics, combining fun designs and gambling elements to retain its player base, even with weeks of no new content. 
The result is a series of games that, overall, are highly addictive but not really that fun to play. While they were born from an extensive study of gaming habits and attitudes, they still feel shallow, as if they’ve been so worried about optimizing their experience that they forgot to actually entertain the audience. 
Of course, they’re not the only games on the market. After all, just two columns ago, I wrote about the new and downright amazing video game “Elden Ring.” But for those of us who play one or two of those highly optimized games, these great titles often feel like the exception to the rule. 
Sure, “Elden Ring” is certainly a masterpiece, but compared to the hundreds of gimmicky games released in the same year, can we say that it’s a good indication of where the industry is headed?
The antidote to these games, then, is not necessarily amazing titles such as “Elden Ring,” which are more like outliers than anything else but rather, successful games that have changed very little throughout the years or whose changes have been made solely with entertainment in mind. 
Sure, they might be clunky around the edges and feature segments that are frustrating, but the sheer fact that their age-old formula has persisted after decades shows that the simple pleasures of gaming still hold strong to this day. 
Case in point: “Kirby and the Forgotten Land.”
I’ve been a Kirby fan since I was little, but even I was amazed by this new title. Finally bringing all the Kirby charm into 3D, the game features fun and challenging platforming puzzles, introducing a handful of new mechanics while at the same time keeping the tried-and-true formula of inhaling enemies and absorbing their powers as its base. 
The game, while not perfect, was still a breath of fresh air for me and kept me coming back even though it had none of the addictive elements I previously described. For some reason, I just couldn’t get enough of it. I was so hypnotized by the game that even my partner decided to jump in, helping me finish off the main story and post-game content.
After definitively finishing all that the game had to offer, I reflected on why it had such a tight grip on me for quite some time. As always, the answer had been simpler than what I expected: It was just fun. 
It was fun to inhale enemies, use their powers and traverse levels. Since the game didn’t rely on one mechanic in particular, none of the fatigue of gimmicky games kicked in. 
After finishing the game, both my partner and I were left wanting even more. Of course, if there were more levels, the game might have overstayed its welcome. But the sheer fact that we were left with that desire spoke volumes about how fun and charming it was. 
If there is any lesson to be learned from this experience, it might be that it’s sometimes good to look back and understand why people enjoyed something in the first place. While advancements are undeniably good, it’s very easy for creators to get caught up in one or two gimmicks and create experiences that are too artificial to be fun. 
In light of finals season, make sure to take a step back and remember what drew you into your major in the first place. Maybe it’s something you’ve always been good at, or maybe always had an interest in. It can even be something extremely simple. 
In my case, it was having fun writing with my friends for the school magazine. Regardless of the magnitude, remembering what caused that initial spark and set you down this path might help you regain that initial wonder and stop you from being focused only on the upcoming assignment. 
In the worst-case scenario, it might give you the motivation you so desperately need after you fail a test.

If you’re on any social media platform, then you probably saw an abundance of posts from the first weekend of Coachella. One of the top music festivals in the world made its return after being canceled in 2020 because of the pandemic. Some ticket holders have held onto their passes for the past two years, just waiting for their chance to attend.
What I’ve noticed more about this weekend compared to past years was the heavy influx of influencers. My TikTok feed is flooded with hundreds of “Get Ready With Me” videos, aesthetically pleasing compilations and the pinnacle of it all: Revolve Festival. 
Every year, companies invite popular influencers to Coachella to stay with them and promote their brand (if you remember the infamous 2019 “Dotechella”). In the past, YouTube has even given out free VIP passes, Google phones and additional merch to influencers they partner with. Yet, it seems as though Revolve has taken the cake this year by inviting content creators to stay at Hotel Revolve and be at their festival but also inviting frequent customers to attend for a whopping $2,000. 
Seemingly every other social media post I see is centered around the Revolve Festival and its influencers. Now, this may be at the fault of my own algorithm, but I don’t feel like I’m alone in this. The brand is known for its role in the fashion industry and influencers make sure to solidify that. Everyone at their festival was sure to be dressed to impress, arriving ready for the perfect Instagram photo. From what I’ve seen, the photo op seems to be the only thing influencers care about. It’s less about enjoying the party and more about planning the next social media post. The one thing that seems to be missing in all of these posts is the music.
While fashion is undoubtedly a big part of Coachella, it’s not the only thing I want to see online. Taking a glance at some creators’ social media profiles, it doesn’t even look like they went to the actual music festival. A few have even admitted to not making it there at all. I understand that this is part of your job, but how do you attend an event as big as Coachella and not enjoy the artists?
As one of those 2020 ticket holders, I’ve personally been waiting for Coachella to finally come back. I was excited to see this year’s lineup was loaded with artists I love — from huge headliners such as Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and The Weeknd to smaller artists on the playbill like Japanese Breakfast, Role Model and Olivia O’Brien. Don’t even get me started on Doja Cat. I know plenty of fans would kill to see these artists live, and influencers seem to take them all for granted.
Coachella 2022 should be a celebration of the return of live music and concerts, but influencers make the festival feel like one big ad campaign. I acknowledge that this is how they make a living, but as the people who have a chokehold on the TikTok algorithm, I think they could be giving us more. I want real concert videos, I want everyone screaming their heads off to every song. While I love the fashion and vlogs, make the music festival about the music.
When fashion wasn’t such a big part of music festivals in the ‘60s, everything centered around gathering and celebrating culture. In the midst of controversy and war, Woodstock provided an opportunity for escapism and unity through music in 1969. The festival created a community and became a symbol of counterculture. However, Woodstock was not the first to embody these values. Two years prior in 1967, The Monterey Pop Festival took place as America’s first major rock festival. This, too, exemplified the start of counterculture and the Summer of Love, a social phenomenon filled with hippies and psychedelic rock.
Festivals like this were more political in nature, with music standing for more than just the industry itself. There were no extravagant amenities that came with extra fees. They were meant for music lovers to socialize and party and truly appreciate the performances. It wasn’t about the aesthetic, it was about the music.
Clearly, festivals have taken a turn since then. The original values have been left behind as festivals now are more concerned with ticket sales and social status. Influencers flocked to Coachella just to be seen. Sponsored videos and pictures are posted left and right to show off a brand’s newest line. 
Technology and social media, like everything else, completely changed the festival industry. The explosion of consumerism has made fashion the highlight of Coachella and consequently attracted every influencer to the event. It’s been reduced to an advertising opportunity rather than recognizing the festival for what it is. I’m always one for appreciating a good Coachella outfit, but at the same time, nothing about the festival or music really changes if you decide to show up in sweatpants.
For Weekend 2, let’s make sure to celebrate the return of live music and artists taking the Coachella stage again.

A gust of wind fans over a field dotted with green and yellow. A dapper brown man, dressed in all black and a chic fedora with a feather in its brim turns before smiling cheekily at the camera and opening his arms wide. Then, a girl — a beauty in a flowy white churidar — gazes back longingly before happily running into his open embrace. 
To any Desi, the soaring strums of guitar and swell of music that marks Simran (Kajol) and Raj’s (Shah Rukh Khan) loving reunion isn’t just familiar — it’s a mark of home. The now-legendary scene from “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” a classic 1995 Bollywood film, is one that captured the hearts, minds and imagination of USC’s South Asian community this past Saturday at the Southern California Indo-Americans culture show.  
The event, packed with a dazzling array of dances, skits and musical performances, brought out South Asian talent from all corners of the SC-Desi multiverse allowing Indian American voices and experiences to exist centerstage. With roughly 200 attendees, the show sought to celebrate the diversity of the region while considering the complexities of Indian Americanness as a dual identity — the primary goal of the show’s organizer’s, Riya Mehta and Anish Kelkar. 
Mehta, a senior majoring in law, history, and culture, said her own journey at USC drove her co-direction of the show.
“Coming to university is such a unique experience — not only are you learning how to live on your own, but you’re also responsible for finding your identity,” she said. “I wanted to showcase South Asian culture and provide a taste of home to those missing it.”  
The night opened with a monologue from Mehta and SCIA co-director Sanika Sahasrabudhe, whose ghagras glimmered as they bantered over whether Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan would make it to the show given his surprise appearance on campus a few days prior. Attested by numerous calls for performers and dancers on the official SCIA Instagram page, putting together the showcase was no easy feat. 
“[This event] really didn’t seem feasible as everyone on the board never got to experience it [a previous show] because of COVID,” said Sakshi Thakkar, SCIA’s co-director. 
This year’s production is the first since 2019’s culture show, which took place March 30, just weeks before campus was shut down because of the first wave of the coronavirus outbreaks. Given this, the theme of the 2019 showcase — “Hum Phir Milenge,” meaning “We will meet again” — managed to be both reassuring and prophetic.
The show kicked into gear with a charming vocals-and-guitar set by Siddanth Bajaj and Aditya Mathur. The night also saw a flurry of dances, from an energetic Bhangra performance set to the thrumming Punjabi beats to a Bollywood number that brought out classic hits such as “Kaala Chashma.”
One particularly memorable act was the kathak, a dance historically associated with storytelling and performance, choreographed by Poorvi Singh, a sophomore majoring in business administration.    
Initially shrouded in darkness, the five dancers from the new kathak club, USCAdaa, made up in traditional costume, held artificial flames in either hand. The performance’s overall impact was ethereal, with dozens of tiny fires glinting in the black. Then, as colorful lights flooded the stage and surrounding walls — effectively immersing the audience in the narrative — the dancers leapt out, skirts flaring in rings around their deft feet. The dance was set to the song “Mahabharat,” centered around the narrative of the classic Indian epic of the same name. Singh said the song appealed to her because it struck a balance between a Bollywood hit and a more classical melody while staying true to the narrative nature of Kathak. 
“A lot of the movements were symbolic or for storytelling purposes, which I think is unique to Kathak as a dance form,” Singh said. “[Kathak is] the amalgamation of different places in India and different religions as well, so it’s like an adapted dance form.”
She was also grateful for being given a platform to showcase a form she has grown up perfecting from when she picked it up at six years old to her Madhumita (debut performance) last year.
“For us to be able to have a platform was a really big deal. And because I guess, classical dance isn’t as represented in the community, it’s good to get the word out there,” Singh said.
The show culminated in a final performance — of the night and of the school year —  by Zeher, USC’s award-winning Bollywood Fusion dance team. The tightly choreographed number was replete with glitter and dance moves that married hip hop with Indian dance techniques. Sanjana Sambhwani, one of Zeher’s dancers, found the experience deeply meaningful.
“Zeher has had a pretty rocky season with a competition in Chicago and a canceled competition due to COVID, so being able to end our season with a performance for all of our friends was such an amazing opportunity,” said Sambhwani, a freshman majoring in cognitive science. “The music, crowd and delicious refreshments really made USC feel like home.” 
Mehta was especially touched after seeing the show come together and the teams hard work pay off. 
“Seeing everyone — from our dancers, choreographers, singers, actors and writers — come together to put on a fantastic show was truly heartwarming,” Mehta said. “To see the turnout in the audience was even better.”

As easy as it is to complain about how North America’s biggest music festival is more of an Instagram influencer feeding frenzy than anything, its lineup serves as an interesting indicator as to where music is right now. Coachella remains an immensely lucrative annual event and Goldenvoice, the agency that produces the festival, obviously has its finger on the pulse. 
USC students and hundreds of thousands of concert goers alike make the trek out to the desert every year. If you didn’t get a chance to secure tickets to the festival’s in-person return, pretend you’re heading to the desert and check out some of the not-headliners on the 2022 bill — and remember, you gotta be here for the music.
Jean Dawson, “PORN ACTING*”
With less than 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, Jean Dawson is an artist to immediately add to your queue. His melancholic, emotional melodies on top of accentuating new-wave instrumentals maintain a punk-esque sound that feels juvenile in the best way. He’s already collaborated with major artists such as Mac DeMarco on “MENTHOL*” and A$AP Rocky on “Triple Double” — both of which are perfect tracks to kick off your indulgence. 
Although not heavily advertised as a main seller on the Coachella lineup, after his feature on Rolling Stone’s Best of Coachella Recap, Dawson is sure to be invited back next year and perhaps receive a slightly bigger font on the advertisement. 
Beach Goons, “Hunny Bunnies”
There should be a special place in everyone’s heart for this band. Their 2016 debut album “Boisaid” certified these young artists as a playlist staple with eight songs that emulate California cool. (They covered Spooky Black’s “Without U” on that album and they did it really well.) This Chicano indie unsurf rock band based out of San Diego is insanely talented. Each of their tracks are filled with energy, and their Spanish songs are some of their best — namely “Chunti.” With a second album released in 2018, they’re a young band, so make sure to hop on now.  
Channel Tres, “Topdown”
Off of the self-titled EP released in 2018, this track is one of the best introductory songs to Channel Tres’ discography. In an effortless flow, the Compton artist — which is reason alone to check him out — blends West Coast-cool rap with smooth house/techno beats, creating the perfect soundscape for dancing. Coachella, through all of its arguably odd headliner choices, remains a great place to get familiar with incredible DJs and house music artists, and it is a great way for smaller artists such as  Channel Tres to grow their following. Check out Channel Tres’ feature on “All That” by fellow supporting act Emotional Oranges to grow your Coachella playlist while hitting two birds with one stone. 
Peggy Gou, “Starry Night – Original Mix”
Based out of Berlin, Peggy Gou is an incredibly talented South Korean-born DJ who has a refreshingly eclectic approach to the tracks she produces. Her ability to tap into disco and deep house sounds that feel classic but never old make both her remixes and own songs excellent listens. Beyond the fact that she’s one of the flyest DJs in the game right now — she learned beatmatching in Korea in 2009 and kept up the hobby while she went to fashion school in London — her global reach is insanely impressive. 
With a couple Coachella performances under her belt and a constant stream of interesting new music, Gou should be an easy addition to your music rotation. 
Even if you did not secure (albeit, overpriced) tickets to the beloved April festival, you do not have to miss out on all the good music. These must-add Coachella bops are sure to get you out of a pre-finals funk and make you feel like you are in the desert, and not your bedroom, dancing to incredible music.

There is no doubt that college is expensive. According to the Education Data Initiative, about 43.4 million Americans owe $1.6 trillion dollars in student debt. USC, in particular, ranks as the most expensive school in California for the 2021-22 school year, according to CollegeCalc. As a low-income student attending such an immensely wealthy school, I sometimes find the apparent privilege and wealth across campus as distressing. 
The seemingly frivolous spending of our University, such as the recent $110 million contract with new Head football coach Lincoln Riley, can feel as if USC does not support low-income students. It feels a bit immoral that USC has provided Riley with a private jet and a $6 million Los Angeles home while students with financial disadvantages struggle to afford their books and school supplies. It is clear that USC has the funds to better support low-income students, and in the severe financial struggle following the pandemic, it is beyond time that the University starts doing so.
In addition to Cal Grants and federal resources such as FAFSA, USC helps students finance their tuition through scholarships, work-study jobs and need-based aid based on your family’s financial situation. However, for other costs such as school supplies and living expenses, like food, students have few resources. The most accessible resource for this kind of aid is the Office of Student Basic Needs, but the process to obtain funds is unnecessarily complicated, with applications evaluated on a case by case basis. 
This is simply not enough. The confining requirements restricting the grant to “students who are experiencing sudden financial distress due to unforeseen circumstances” — as stated on the Office’s website — make it inaccessible for many students who struggle with constant financial distress, and therefore have an ongoing need for financial aid, in which a “one-time funding opportunity” will not suffice. Receiving the aid one needs to support their college education should not be difficult, especially not from a school such as USC, which boasts an immense image of wealth. 
As discussed by Washington Post writer Karen Weese, the number one reason low-income students drop out is due to financial distress, which tends to stem from a minor detail or an abundance of minor details that middle class students wouldn’t have to think about twice, like being unable to afford transportation, food or school supplies. Scholarships and financial aid for college tuition serve a great purpose and make the idea of higher education accessible to disadvantaged students. However, there are many more hidden expenses that come with attending college that scholarships and financial aid do not cover. It is often these small expenses that add up to make college unaffordable. 
Colleges can alleviate all of these “minor” spendings if they would just provide school supplies, such as laptops and textbooks, which can be very expensive but are a necessity in college. Although these expenses might be minor to wealthy universities such as USC, to low-income students, these expenses could make or break their college careers. 
According to a 2020 Daily Trojan article, students spend $20,000 on average on school supplies, housing and transportation on top of their tuition. While some students at USC can afford to spend $20,000 in addition to tuition, most students cannot. 
USC prides itself on its Affordability Initiative, an initiative that funds the full cost of tuition for students whose families make $80,000 or less, regardless of home equity. While this seems like an extremely generous gesture, it still leaves students with a large sum of money to cover the cost of housing, meal plans and several other binding expenses. If USC wants to foster a diverse community of students, it must choose to invest in the needs of its most vulnerable students over the superficial desires of keeping up its lavish appearances. USC claims that their first priority is the education of its students, but they have yet to truly prove it.

If you’ve seen Hulu’s “Dopesick” — or the nonfiction book that inspired the miniseries about the origin and subsequent unraveling of the opioid crisis — you might remember that Virginia served as the central focus of the plotlines. Virginia was not randomly chosen as the setting for “Dopesick,” nor was it just one of many random states affected by the Sackler family’s lies and deceit. 
The Sacklers embodied a presence just as big as the coal mining companies did in the region and exploited low-income Black and Indigenous communities and communities of color that make up a significant portion of the population in the Appalachians and the southern U.S. The family owns Purdue Pharma, the group responsible for creating Oxycontin, one of the most commonly abused prescription drugs in the country, according to the Addiction Center. While a primary component of the problem, the Sacklers are not the sole people responsible for this disastrous situation. The opioid epidemic has latched onto the nation and Appalachia for as long as it has because of the inaction of elected officials and politicians. 
Virginia is but one state in what is known as the Appalachians, a region that stretches as far south as Mississippi and as high up as New York. This mountainous region paves the way for the Sacklers’ schemes to have a much harsher impact. According to a 2017 report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Appalachian counties experienced an opioid overdose death rate 72% higher than in non-Appalachian counties. That situation was exacerbated by the onset of the coronavirus, which put an additional barrier on top of the already existing ones related to healthcare access, education, solid employment and transportation. 
You might know someone affected by the opioid crisis. The crisis has led to more than 500,000 deaths worldwide over a span of 20 years, tearing families apart or relegating others to seek costly long-term care. I hope, then, that you’ll agree with me when I argue that the recent plea deal to come out of the opioid lawsuits — in which the Sacklers agreed to pay at least $6 billion in cash in exchange for all current and future civil suits against them to end — is nowhere near fair or just. 
Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong seems to agree, saying at a news conference, “No one is under any illusion this solves all the problems we’re facing … This settlement is both significant and insufficient — constrained by the inadequacies of our federal bankruptcy code.”
And it is tough to be angry at greedy pharmaceutical companies who don’t really have a care in the world for the lives they destroyed, knowing well that the system of laws we have in place rigorously protects these companies from reprimand. There’s no single way you could measure or quantify true justice in this situation. If you could, it would be a bill, even the billionaire Sacklers couldn’t pay.
But there’s hope. There’s hope in a rather unattractive area of policy and law that Tong mentioned prior: bankruptcy. NPR’s Brian Mann, who covers litigation against pharmaceutical companies, essentially calls bankruptcy an opportunity, not an outright defeat, for the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma. Mann essentially said that declaring bankruptcy allows the Sacklers to throw disposable money, such as a company and assets (but by no means all of their money) to clean up after the sinking ship that is Purdue Pharma. In exchange for that, the Sacklers get a trade-off of being able to rinse their hands and hide behind a shield of immunity from future lawsuits. The use of bankruptcy as what is, at its core, a get-out-of-jail-free card, is not a phenomenon unique to this scenario. Many companies such as Hertz Global Holdings Inc. have used this to their advantage.
Through the layman’s eyes, this is evidence of the fact that if you’re rich enough, you can get away with just about anything.
Congress, as ineffective as it is, has the ability to hopefully expand the reach that justice can have when it comes to reprimanding companies like Purdue Pharma. In August 2021, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act, which they say would make sure that those participating in unlawful acts can’t escape liability by opting for bankruptcy. 
Opioid deaths and addiction don’t discriminate between political party affiliations, which is all the more reason for both sides of the aisle to come together to fix our bankruptcy laws to guarantee what the Sacklers started doing almost two decades ago won’t happen again.

On April 7, the Daily Trojan reported that USC intends to raise its tuition by 5% for the 2022-23 school year, bringing the University’s total cost of attendance to $63,468 per year, according to the University’s financial aid website. While the University has yet to publicly announce the increase for next year — only announcing the tuition increase on the University’s undergraduate admission website — the uptick in cost comes at the hopeful end of the pandemic, when unemployment has decreased and more families can afford to pay. This uptick also comes shortly after the news of the class of 2026’s record low 12% acceptance rate, signifying an increase in demand. 
However, this increase also represents a significant barrier for many prospective students, disproportionately affecting underprivileged and international students. Although many USC students receive some sort of financial aid, aid opportunities are limited. 
As universities saw a rise in a craving for degrees throughout history, they began to monetize that appetite. Recognizing the extent of a prestigious degree’s demand, universities increased the price of education dramatically. In 1975, a four-year degree from Harvard would have cost you an estimated $5,350. Today, that same degree costs upwards of $219,072. While inflation and urbanization, among other factors, can partly explain this disparity, much of it is a result of universities realizing the size of their markets.
As prices continue to soar and a free education becomes an ever-more-distant possibility, we are forced to ask whether education should be considered a commodity or a necessary good. Under our current system, K-12 education is seemingly considered a right of all citizens, while any later education is not, subject instead to market forces. However, this distinction is unrealistic and unreasonable in current times.
A similar debate was underway in the 1830s — but back then, it was about the accessibility of high school. At the time, high school education was not widely available, and the nation began to realize that it was necessary for the expanding workforce. A high school degree was often enough to propel a young adult from the lower class to the middle class, evening the playing field. So, education reformer Horace Mann began the common school movement in an effort to allocate property taxes to public high schools. 
Even now, a high school diploma is considered as the highest form of education that should be deemed a public good which is evident in the compulsory ​​education laws that nearly all states have. Nearly 200 years have passed since Mann’s triumph for educational justice, during which the college degree has become more and more necessary as a means of social mobility as the value of the high school diploma has diminished. The vast majority of jobs that allow for social mobility are restricted without a college degree, and a four-year college education is largely considered the standard for “higher education.” Despite these obvious social cues of the need for change, USC’s tuition, in line with other “elite university” tuitions, has only increased in the last 50 years. 
Many universities follow a market-like system, in which tuition increases are met with a decrease in demand, such as lower enrollment rates. As a result, these universities employ tuition resets (decreases of up to 50%). “Elite” universities like USC, however, act almost like a luxury good within the higher education system, solidified by annual rankings put out by Forbes, USA Today and other publications. Renowned institutions such as USC are able to survive despite the cost inefficiencies that exist in the market. 
Forbes writer Preston Cooper cites this issue as the result of degrees from elite universities being overvalued, an excess of barriers with creating new universities and a lack of regional competitors. There is an incredibly high demand for degrees from these institutions, as indicated by their admission rates, which suggest that the universities could fill their incoming classes at least 10 times over in many cases. 
Even during the pandemic, during which the country experienced an economic downturn, USC was the fourth most expensive college in the U.S. on CBS’s most expensive U.S. colleges list —  a placement that does not take into account the 5% tuition increase this coming year. 
Despite this trend towards more expensive education, a handful of schools have recognized the changing times. In 2019, New Mexico announced that it would be making tuition to all its state colleges completely free for all state residents. This is a drastic and unprecedented change, citing low income levels in the state. The change, which has been in effect since 2019, is proof that free public college education is not only possible, but also necessary in the fight against social injustice. 
Addressing inequality is a hallmark of our time. If we do not continue to fight for higher education accessibility, we undo over 200 years of social progress. While private universities such as USC may not have an option to go completely free, these annual tuition increases stand in opposition to the University’s stance on accessible education. As one of the most expensive universities, USC has a responsibility to acknowledge the importance of making education financially accessible.
