The men’s golf team will kick off their 2019 spring season at the Amer Ari Invitational this weekend. After a couple months away, the No. 4 Trojans will look to continue their stellar season in what appears to be a loaded field at the Waikoloa Kings’ Course in Hawaii.  
The Trojans started off the fall season ranked in the mid-twenties, but have steadily risen to break the top five as the season has progressed. The Amer Ari Invitational presents another chance for the team to prove itself against higher-ranked opponents.  
Aside from various Hawaiian and West Coast schools, powerhouses such as No. 1 Oklahoma State and second-ranked Georgia Tech aim to solidify their status as the best two teams in the nation. Other ranked teams include No. 12 Texas and No. 13 Auburn, who had a huge jump in the standings at the end of fall play. The field is very similar to last year, as are the rankings of the teams in the tournament at this point last season.  
These four teams, along with USC, should control the field, as four of the five teams earned conference championships in 2018, and Oklahoma State won the 2018 NCAA title. USC’s performance against them could help set the tone for their overall performance in the second and more crucial half of the season.  
The men’s squad finished off the fall of 2018 at the St. Mary’s Invitational with a eighth out of 18 finish, despite starting with a large deficit. In fact, slow starts developing into hot finishes have become a common storyline this season, as St. Mary’s was not the first time that the team has recovered from a bad day one in a tournament.  
However, the Trojans cannot rely too heavily on second or third day heroics this time around. In the St. Mary’s Tournament, USC was one of the best overall teams present, and a comeback was not too surprising. The caliber of teams the Trojans will face at Amer Ari will most likely be good enough to fend off any comeback bids by USC because of their staunchly  solid lineups.  
For USC to have a successful outing, the whole team must play consistently well and post good numbers on all three days. In 2018’s Amer Ari tournament, USC finished a solid third behind Oklahoma State and Georgia Tech. Oklahoma State dominated last year and again boasts an amazing team, but if USC is to contend with them in any tournament, it would be this one.  
Senior Justin Suh will look to bounce back from an underwhelming performance at St. Mary’s at Amer Ari. Last year, he was able to shoot under 70 on all three days and claim the individual title at the tournament.
This season, he will have even more support as freshman Charlie Reiter will attempt to extend his impressive campaign. Additionally, sophomore Issei Tanabe played outstandingly well into 2018, leading the Trojans to their comeback in the St. Mary’s Tournament by finishing second overall.
The team has reason for excitement this weekend and could make a huge statement if they were to beat Oklahoma State, Georgia Tech or even both. This tournament could hint at USC’s potential to make a title run in the postseason, so the stakes and pressure will be extremely high.

Men’s basketball fell to the Utah Utes 77-70 at home Wednesday night. The Trojans were not able to overcome their struggles in the first half, though they followed with a strong second-half performance.
Utah scored 7 unanswered points to open the game, as the Utes were patient in their shot selection and the Trojans were unable to create any effective offense of their own. USC did not score their first points until freshman guard Elijah Weaver finished a floater three minutes into the half. Weaver was also able to hit a 3-pointer before Utah could counter, tying the game at 7-7.
Following a USC timeout, Utah continued to play at a gradual pace of play and scored 8 unanswered points. The Utes were able to break down USC’s defense with crisp passing and brought the score up to 15-7 after seven minutes of play.
The Trojans’ offensive attempts proved to be fruitless as they fell cold following their 7-point outburst. USC lacked an inside presence when junior forward Nick Rakocevic was subbed out, and they did not fare any better from beyond the arc, hitting only one of their first six 3-point attempts. This combination led to a stagnant offense that allowed Utah to control the game.
“[Rakocevic] is a big part of our offense and he’s a rebounder,” head coach Andy Enfield said.“But tonight was just an off night.”
The Utes dictated the pace of play and were able to draw fouls on USC to get to the free throw line on several occasions. The Trojans’ foul trouble was a product of Utah’s size advantage in the front court, which gave the Utes an edge on the glass — they outrebounded the Trojans 16-7 with six minutes left in the half. USC was unable to collect any rebounds on the offensive end to this point, taking away any opportunities for second chance points.
Utah established a commanding 20-point lead, but their offense cooled down as evidenced by their two shot clock violations and several missed shots. USC was unable to capitalize on these opportunities, however, and its field goal percentage dropped to 31.8 percent with three minutes left in the first half.
Utah’s freshman forward Both Gach forced USC to call another timeout following two consecutive 3-pointers. Following the timeout, the Trojans attempted to end the half on a strong note by scoring 6 unanswered points. However, they still faced a large deficit on the scoreboard, trailing Utah 37-23.
“We came out flat,” Mathews said. “[Utah] was hitting wide open threes.”
The opening minutes of the second half were not much of an improvement for the Trojans as their shooting struggles continued. USC’s only field goal through three minutes was a 3-pointer by senior forward Bennie Boatwright, while Utah continued to add to its lead and held a 50-28 advantage over the Trojans.
Utah showcased a strong presence from beyond the arc throughout the second half that helped it maintain its dominant offensive game. The Utes’ 29 3-point attempts for the game forced USC to defend them at the line at all times. Even when the Utes’ shots did not fall, the Trojans still felt the long-range threat.
Despite the large deficit, USC showcased a streak of their own 3-point abilities when Boatwright and junior guard Jonah Mathews combined for three made shots from deep at the midway point of the second half. This momentum shift was highlighted in the Trojans’ next offensive run, as Rakocevic dropped a behind-the-back pass to freshman guard Kevin Porter, who threw down an electrifying dunk to bring the score to 58-44 with just under nine minutes left in regulation.
Mathews refused to let the game get away from the Trojans, as he hit three straight 3-point shots. The Trojans appeared much more determined following this run and displayed strong defensive effort; however, the deficit still loomed following the first half blowout, and Utah was still comfortably ahead by a score of 64-53 with five minutes left in the game.
“We were playing hard enough on defense to get back in the game,” Enfield said. “Unfortunately, we just couldn’t get that lead down.”
The Trojans played at a very high level in the game’s final minutes, displaying energy on both ends of the court. However, they were ultimately unable to make the comeback as Utah made enough shots and free throws to hold on.
Mathews led USC with 18 points on 7-of-14 shooting, but he was the only Trojan to play truly well. Boatwright and Rakocevic were the only other players to score in double figures, and neither shot better than 44 percent from the floor. 
Gach led the Utes with 15 points, while junior center Jayce Johnson had 13 points and 13 rebounds. The Utes made 14 of 21 attempts from the free throw line, compared to 7-for-11 for the Trojans.
The Trojans will face Colorado 7 p.m. Saturday at Galen Center. Colorado currently holds a 4-6 conference record after defeating UCLA at home Wednesday night 84-73.

With the 2019 National Signing Day in the books, the Trojans filled positions of need at defensive back and secured five-star wide receiver Kyle Ford’s marquee commitment to top off an overall underwhelming class. Not only was the class not in the top 15 nationally, but it also did not beat out its Pac-12 rivals, ranking No. 18 overall and No. 3 in the Pac-12. To put it into perspective, the Trojan class was No. 4 overall last year and No. 1 in the Pac-12.
On Wednesday, head coach Clay Helton shared his goals for the upcoming season and areas for improvement on the team. On the offensive side of the ball, Helton praised newly signed offensive coordinator Graham Harrell for the strides he hopes to make in USC’s passing game. USC’s offense was lackluster on almost every front in 2018, but Helton said Harrell hopes to continue the success he had elevating a North Texas team to offensive dominance through pass-heavy schemes. Helton noted that while he wants to focus on the passing game, he will not employ an air raid scheme and will run the ball.
The efforts to improve the passing game will be aided by Ford, a Southern California native who verbally committed to the Trojans in early January. Trojans fans were sweating bullets before Ford’s commitment after fellow recruit Bru McCoy transferred to Texas before  playing a single game. 
Ford’s senior season was derailed by an ACL injury and Helton said the team will not rush him back to play. Even if Ford doesn’t see the field in 2019, his big frame and ability to win the jump ball will be a weapon for the Trojans in the future as they begin their schematic offensive overhaul.
After seeing major attrition within the position in the past two years, with eight players leaving the program for various reasons, the five new signees at defensive back will fill a huge role on the team. The Trojans went to the South to recruit three of their signees who will look to replace the void of production left by departing seniors Iman Marshall, Ajene Harris and Isaiah Langley — key players on the defense. 
USC managed to flip Adonis Otey, a Tennessee native, from his prior verbal commitment to Arkansas. Otey is a versatile athlete, contributing as a safety, running back and kick returner in high school. 
Helton said he is excited about Dorian Hewett, another southern recruit. Hewett won the Texas state championship and ran track, recording a 100-meter time of 10.73 seconds. 
The Trojans also managed to snag a commitment from local JUCO prospect Jaylen Watson. Watson, another southern prospect, is originally from Augusta, Ga. A versatile athlete, he filled up the stat sheet in JUCO with 43 tackles, 13 passes defended, four interceptions and one fumble recovery. 
Another non-local signee, Kauluna Makaula, looks to slot in at safety for the Trojans because of his 6-foot-3 frame and rounds out a solid core of three-star defensive backs. 
Tuasivi Nomura, a safety in high school, signed with the Trojans, but will likely be an outside linebacker for USC this fall. This year’s group is not filled with the five- and four-star players the Trojans are used to, but it does a solid job filling a position of need for this upcoming season.
Four-star wide receiver recruit Puka Nacua, a verbal USC commit, did not sign with any team on Wednesday and will take time to explore other options. The receiver from Utah had over 2,300 receiving yards his senior season, a state record, and is being pursued by many Pac-12 rivals.
Although Helton didn’t reveal specifics, he said the 2020 class would be smaller in size than 2019. The final date for recruits to sign their letter of intent is April 1.

On one of the most important days in college athletics, California State Sen. Nancy Skinner formally inked a proposition that could fundamentally change the way that people view college athletes.
Skinner submitted Senate Bill 206 — the “Fair Pay to Play Act” — on Wednesday. Wednesday was also National Signing Day, when hundreds of thousands of athletes sign their lives away to universities across the country. Her goal is to allow athletes to receive compensation for their work as athletes, forcing California head-on into a heated national debate over athlete pay and the concept of “amateurism” in college sports.
Skinner’s bill, however, makes a distinction. Instead of requiring universities to provide paychecks along with scholarships, it creates a provision that allows athletes to receive outside payments that were previously banned under NCAA policies. If the bill is passed, college athletes in California could soon sell endorsements, jerseys, autographs, workshops and more for profit without losing their scholarships.
This bill is a vital step forward for college athletes, marking the beginning of a necessary, full-on war between legislators and the NCAA.
Simply put, the college sports industry as it currently stands is a cartel. The NCAA has a chokehold on all opportunities for talented athletes early in their career; if an athlete wants to make it in the NFL or NBA, they have to spend one to three years in the NCAA first. And in those years, they only receive payment in form of grant-in-aid, a scholarship for an education that is watered down and often worth less than what these athletes contribute to their athletic department’s annual revenue.
Although there are still those who defend the supposed “purity” of amateurism in the NCAA, the vast majority of the country is beginning to realize the inequality of the college sports industry. Coaches and schools are making millions off the back of unpaid labor, and the facade of a “free education” is beginning to wear thin in light of continuous scandals.
While a general consensus that something should be done about the status quo is becoming inevitable, the real difficulty comes in crafting a solution. Which players do you pay? Stars? Starters? Those who generate revenue? Many argue it isn’t fair to pay athletes in revenue-generating sports and not others who work just as hard in track and field or lacrosse. Others point out the difficulty in creating a sliding-scale model for player compensation based on playing time or team impact.
What Skinner has proposed, however, is an important change that side-steps the issue of university compensation. This bill would not force universities to pay their athletes; instead, it would simply remove limitations that previously prohibited athletes from making any sort of outside income.
Those prohibitions are, in my opinion, the absolute worst part of the NCAA’s war on player compensation. To completely protect the so-called amateurism of its athletes, the NCAA prohibits athletes from using their own likenesses for profit. 
Quite literally, athletes don’t have autonomy over their own names and images. While their universities sell jerseys inscribed with their numbers and use their faces to sell out stadiums, players are prohibited from even selling autographs. Skinner’s law gives athletes the right to their own identity, allowing them to at the least make a living off of their own skills. 
For a state boasting four Pac-12 schools, the California senate needs to pass this bill. It would benefit more than just a state full of players who deserve more than tuition for their efforts as student athletes. This bill has the ability to topple perhaps the most ludicrous aspect of the current lack of player compensation, and it could at least set a precedent for a nationwide conversation regarding how we treat college athletes.
It would inevitably garner major backlash from the NCAA, which as a national organization would no doubt lash out over any attempt at interference from a state government. But this would only formally set the stage for a future legal conversation at both the state and national level about player compensation, something that has failed time and time again, most recently in the O’Bannon v. NCAA case.
The battle to give NCAA athletes full rights to their own compensation will be a long and brutal one, and a single bill won’t solve all of its problems. However, Skinner’s bill marks a vital step toward the future, and its passing could begin to forge a new era of autonomy for student athletes.

Los Angeles is a fertile ground for culinary innovation, a cultural funnel sifting through centuries of tradition and history to find a few dishes that stick with the American palate. It can be credited with the popularization (and thus, Americanization) of several iconic cuisines, but one of its most important is Japanese. Like tacos from Mexico and pho from Vietnam, a singular dish dominates the Japanese American cuisine: sushi. 
But as is so common in our history, this food we love comes from a community that the United States has historically exploited and abused. 
It’s no surprise that since L.A. had the honor of commodifying sushi — plucked from the ocean, fresh and exciting, a beacon of health — its very identity mirrors that of this city. Its high price and relative exoticism made it immediately attractive to the rich and wealthy, and its protein-rich fish became popular among diet-conscious celebrities. While the California roll originated in Canada, its namesake was earned because of its popularity in L.A.
In the 1880s, Japanese people immigrated to the United States with the hope of finding prosperous jobs. The Chinese Exclusion Act left American businesses without immigrant workers, who the Japanese quickly replaced. L.A., less volatile and more booming than San Francisco, soon became home to tens of thousands of Japanese immigrants, clustered mostly in the area of downtown Los Angeles now known as Little Tokyo. This community brought Japanese business and culture to the city, expanding into Boyle Heights and continuing to grow until World War II.
Since the mid-70s, sushi restaurants have swept through the city and flooded the rest of the country, swiftly adapting to American palates by adding ingredients like cream cheese and tempura and flipping the seaweed inside of the sushi roll. Today, there are well over 300 Japanese restaurants in Los Angeles alone, ranging from 13-course $225 dinners at N/Naka to all-you-can-eat sushi for $20. For under $50, an omakase meal at Sugarfish presents several courses of tender fish draped over warm, soft rice. At Sushi Gen, operating since 1980, the sashimi lunch special arrives with nine different types of fish all for $20. Not only has sushi become a mainstay in L.A.’s culinary landscape,  but it has also infiltrated every price point.
Beyond sushi, other types of Japanese cuisine have found massive success in Los Angeles, including the ever-popular ramen, yakitori and udon restaurants, as well as more specialized restaurants like Konbi, which makes Japanese-style sandwiches, or Chinchikurin, churning out okonomiyaki (savory pancakes) in Little Tokyo. Grocery stores like Mitsuwa and Marukai Market have become increasingly popular for their cheap Japanese offerings. 
However, in the heat of World War II, Executive Order 9066 called for all Japanese and Japanese American citizens to be placed in concentration camps. Little Tokyo became a ghost town as over 100,000 Japanese people, including orphans and those with little Japanese heritage, were ripped from their homes and forced into internment camps for over 3 years with their constitutional rights stripped. In 1988, nearly 45 years after the war, Ronald Reagan apologized to victims, most of whom had passed away. 
All too often, we appreciate a nation’s culture without examining our impact on it. Japanese food may have a strong presence in Los Angeles, but its popularity is isolated from the history of Japanese citizens. Japanese culture is constantly fetishized, devoured and compartmentalized — a final act of imperialist dominance. 
In the dim lighting of Sugarfish, or in the salty air on the deck of Nobu, it is easy to forget the struggle of Japanese citizens in L.A. —  most people don’t even know that beyond the delicious ramen and incredible sushi, our propagation of Japanese food hides a darkly familiar story of xenophobia and racism. 
But slowly, a well-rounded understanding of Japan and its influences are beginning to seep into the city. Japanese museums and societies have worked to preserve the memory of those held at internment camps. Clusters of authentic and high-quality Japanese restaurants have emerged by the dozens in the last 10 years, with Sawtelle Japantown growing like a vine through Mid-City, Little Tokyo swarming with tourists and countless other Japanese-inspired restaurants opening from Malibu to Torrance. 
Like most other facets of this city, sushi is a glamorous icon with a dark past. And, while it’s easy to appreciate the delicate flavor profile and unique presentation of Japanese food, it is time to start remembering (and appreciating) the Japanese people who fought to make L.A. their home.

Directors Jon M. Chu and Rawson Thurber, both USC alumni, spoke with students about their careers, paths to success and advice for future entertainment creators in the Ray Stark Family Theatre Tuesday. 
School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley started Tuesday’s talk with an introduction of the Alumni Conversation series. This was the inaugural event, to kick off a celebration of the SCA’s 90th Anniversary. 
“We’re doing this so that our alumni can share with each other and with you the kind of conversations that can only happen in a place where a professional community comes together,” Daley said. 
Chu, who directed the global blockbuster romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians,” graduated from USC in 2003 with a degree in film and television production. The film was nominated for an array of awards, including two Golden Globes, a Screen Actors Guild Award and several Critics’ Choice Awards. 
Thurber graduated from USC in 1999 after participating in the Peter Stark Producing Program. Thurber’s first feature screenplay was the hit 2004 comedy, “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,” and since then, he has directed comedies like “We’re the Millers” and “Central Intelligence.”  
The pair kicked off the conversation by explaining how they know each other, despite attending USC at different times. Thurber saw “Step Up 2: The Streets” and became an admirer of Chu’s work, while Chu first became acquainted with Rawson when Rawson wrote “Dodgeball.”
During the conversation, Chu recounted successfully pitching one of his first projects to director Steven Spielberg, and Thurber spoke about his journey to making “Dodgeball.” 
“I wrote a bad action movie, and I gave it to [screenwriter] John August,” Thurber said, referring to one of the first projects he wrote. “He has the script of my bad action movie, and he throws it on the desk and says ‘nope.’”  
Rawson and Chu also spoke about their upcoming projects. Chu’s next project will be the highly anticipated film adaptation of playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical, “In The Heights.” According to Chu, this production follows a string of projects he says left him “creatively empty.”
“I was doing genres I didn’t know if I wanted to do or not,” Chu said. “I just want to find something that means something more to what I want to say, and I came across two things: ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ and ‘In The Heights.’” 
For his next film, Rawson will team up with actor Dwayne Johnson on “Red Notice.” Rawson came up with the idea for the film while they were shooting their previous collaboration, “Skyscraper.” Drawing from this experience, Rawson also stressed the importance of effective pitching in the film industry.
“It needs to be a conversation between the people in the room and if you look like you’re running for eighth grade class president, it’s over,” Rawson said. “Create a picture in their mind as best you can.” 
The two directors also offered advice for students hoping to enter the entertainment industry. 
“I find that most actors, especially nowadays, on commercial pictures — that sacred rehearsal period has eroded,” Rawson said. “Film dailies are also gone. But for me, the rehearsal period is about going through the scenes with the actors, and mostly, it’s like ‘Are there any problems here?’”
On whether movies still have a place in theaters due to the rise in film and TV streaming, Chu offered an experience he garnered from “Crazy Rich Asians.” 
“We knew that the impact of movies through cinema, it still has a place in culture, a big place,” he said in reference to his decision to release the movie theatrically as opposed to a streaming service like Netflix.
Chu and Thurber’s conversation is the first of many alumni panels that SCA will host to celebrate its 90th Anniversary.

Though Lee Blessing wrote “Fortinbras” as a critique of former president George H. W. Bush in 1991, the play still carries with it a timely precision. 
Watching the play, it’s hard not to notice the parallels between the protagonist Fortinbras — who invents and distorts the truth for his own gain — and players in the current political climate. Yet, director senior Ian Stewart Riley said they didn’t want to overplay their hand on this front. 
“It would be very easy to have Fortinbras walk in with a combover and an oversized tie and a poorly fitting suit, but who is that for?” Riley said. “That’s just an ‘SNL’ sketch that goes on too long.”
“Fortinbras,” a new production by the independent, student-run Aeneid Theatre Company,  premiered last weekend at Massman Theatre. The comedic play takes place after the events of Shakespeare’s classic tragedy, “Hamlet,” when Prince Fortinbras of Norway takes the throne and features most of the cast of “Hamlet” as ghosts. 
According to Riley, though some political satire elements are at play, Fortinbras is ultimately a sympathetic character who’s doing the best he can in an “overwhelming and surreal situation.” Riley said the audience shouldn’t be glad to watch Fortinbras fall, as he’s just a guy who tries to have all the answers but soon realizes he doesn’t — and there are consequences to his arrogance. 
Rather than diving too far into the political satire, much of the humor in “Fortinbras” stems from its interplay with the plot of “Hamlet.” This close relationship with the original text may be part of the reason “Fortinbras” isn’t often performed on a large scale, Riley said. 
“It is a very fun play to big theater nerds,” Riley said. “But it’s not something [where] you’d come in from out of town and be like, ‘Let’s go see this weird satirical look at ‘Hamlet.’”
Nevertheless, at Sunday’s production, the crowd certainly seemed to engage with the jokes poking fun at “Hamlet.”
Sophomore Brandon Lessard, who plays Laertes, said “Fortinbras” openly mocks the subtext of the original play. For instance, it’s often said that there exists a subtextual sexual tension between Hamlet and his mother, Lessard said, a plot point “Fortinbras” calls out explicitly. 
Riley said the amount that “Fortinbras” relies on “Hamlet” initially caused him to struggle a bit, as he wasn’t as familiar with Shakespeare’s play as his colleagues. Lessard, like some others on the cast,  reread “Hamlet” in preparation. 
“I definitely didn’t know much at first,” Lessard said. “It’s hard to tell a joke when you don’t know what the punchline is.”
Another way the play toys with “Hamlet” is through its portrayal of the central characters, whose personalities are largely opposite to their “Hamlet” counterparts. Laertes, for instance, says he’s not a man of violence at one point in “Fortinbras,” a marked shift from the man who rushes back to Denmark and kills Hamlet in the original play. 
Likely the starkest change in character is seen in Ophelia, a more outspoken, central character in “Fortinbras.” Junior student Celia Rivera plays Ophelia. Rivera noticed that the character often doesn’t get to say what she really thinks or do what she really wants in the original production.
“She doesn’t get to have a life,” Rivera said. “So for her, in death, this is … the time for her to do things that she never got to do and decide what her own legacy will be.”
Ultimately, Ophelia must accept the past as it happened — a realization Rivera sees as crucial to the arc of the play. To Rivera, “Fortinbras” boils down to this: Both Ophelia and Fortinbras are holding onto realities they know they can’t have and must accept it.
“Life has to go on — you can’t hold on to what was, you just have to … move on into the future.” Rivera said. “You can’t rewrite [the truth], you just have to let it be.”

The Undergraduate Student Government held its first ever Senate Forum on Jan. 31. The 20 senatorial candidates were given an opportunity to present their platforms and answer questions from the audience. It’s surprising that this forum was the first one USG has ever held — in the past, students should have had the same opportunities to meet their candidates and ask them questions in a formal setting. 
While candidates do attempt to reach out to students via social media, posters and flyers, USG must continue to promote similar forums, and candidates must do more to reach out to students directly. Both USG and its senatorial candidates need to improve student engagement in the USG elections process by actively using social media and increasing their campaigns’ publicity. 
USG uses its own Instagram account to promote the presidential candidates but somewhat glosses over the senatorial candidates. Each presidential ticket received its own post with a caption that detailed its platform and vision. The candidates’ Instagram accounts were also linked to these posts. However, the same publicity was not given to the senatorial candidates. All of the tickets are crammed into a single post, with no information about their individual platform points or social media handles. In the future, these senatorial candidates must be accorded the same exposure that their presidential counterparts enjoy to increase awareness of student campaign efforts.
Candidates for both the senate and the presidency are active on Instagram, but they appear to receive little engagement from students. While most accounts have posted colorful graphics detailing their platforms, their posts, for the most part, have no comments. Most of these posts are informational and do not ask for questions from the student body regarding their platforms. Politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have used Instagram, specifically the live-streaming feature, to directly engage with questions from their constituents. USG candidates could benefit from being similarly active on social media.
The most direct way candidates interact with students is through representatives standing on Trousdale Parkway canvassing and handing out flyers. While this is helpful for candidate visibility in the USC community, it only provides a cursory glance at what candidates hope to change and improve at the University. Most students are hurrying to classes and hardly stop to talk to candidates or discuss their platform points. To view candidates’ platforms, students would have to visit the USG website, a step most are not willing to take and many are even unaware of.
For students to more fully understand what the candidates stand for, USG must organize more forums to increase student interaction with candidates. 
If students were given ample opportunity to interact with their candidates, they would be more invested in the electoral process. Students can also ask candidates directly about their stances on issues instead of only having access to a brief overview on the USG website. 
While the Senate Forum was a step in the right direction, it had some glaring flaws. The forum was held in a classroom in Grace Ford Salvatori Hall with a relatively small capacity. This discouraged large groups of students from attending. If USG used larger theaters, more students could come to learn about their candidates.
In addition to holding informational forums, USG should consider hosting debates for senate candidates. Debates are common in national and state elections, and they allow for more direct comparisons of candidates’ platforms. This active and engaging event style could increase student turnout and overall interest in student government.
Establishing this tradition of respectful competition would engage more students in the electoral process and allow candidates to spar directly with each other over issues they care about. 
USG, and the candidates themselves, must provide better channels for students to interact directly with campaigns. Through increased engagement, students will be more invested in USG, turn out to vote and hold their representatives accountable once they take office.

In the past decade, “diversity” has become one of the media’s favorite buzzwords. Journalists love reporting on new diversity initiatives, and pundits will talk without end about the lack of diversity in American institutions from Congress to Hollywood. While keeping watch on inclusion is undoubtedly necessary, the media tends to turn a blind eye to diversity in one particular industry — its own. 
According to the 2018 American Society of News Editors Newspaper Diversity Survey, which analyzed the gender and race breakdowns of 292 newsrooms across America, newsrooms are 59 percent male on average. Furthermore, the survey found that when compared to the demographics of the cities they served, newsrooms were 25 percentage points more white than their audiences on average. 
These numbers have stayed largely static throughout the 21st century: Compared to 2001, only 39 percent of newsrooms saw an increase in racial diversity — but only by an average of 6.8 percentage points. Sixteen percent of newsrooms even saw a decrease in racial diversity.
Newsrooms need diversity for all the same reasons any workplace or institution does. Inclusion allows for a variety of perspectives in the workplace, which enables more effective problem solving. It encourages individuals to challenge each others’ viewpoints and ideas, fostering innovation and creativity. 
Inclusive hiring practices also help rectify systemic biases that have continually excluded women and people of color from workplaces in the past. Whether because of conscious or unconscious bias from the hiring level onward, minority individuals often struggle to make their way into their chosen career fields, even if they have comparable qualifications to their white, male peers. Often, minority individuals are even discouraged from pursuing careers that are dominated by white men. 
Newsrooms share all of these workplace issues, but diversity is more important in the news media because of the nature of the industry. Journalists are tasked with accurately informing and reporting on their community — among other responsibilities, this means painting a broad picture of the cultures and perspectives represented in one’s community. 
Technically, it’s possible to do this in an unrepresentative newsroom by sending reporters to cover cultures outside of their own backgrounds and experiences. But this poses myriad issues. 
First, it results in imbalanced and inaccurate coverage. Too often, news organizations have to apologize for insensitive reporting on cultures their journalists are unfamiliar with. 
One recent example was in The New York Times’ podcast, “The Daily.” On one episode, a reporter manufactured a border crossing from Mexico to the U.S., making an often dangerous immigrant journey seem like a short, easy trip across a river. The crossing lacked the voices of actual immigrants speaking about their experience crossing the border and instead gave voice to an American reporter. 
“Proper journalism gives subjects a voice, rather than reducing the voice of an entire minority to that of an American man with a microphone and background noises of splashing water,” Hugo Balta, the president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, wrote in a statement NAHJ released after the episode aired. 
Second, a lack of diversity results in journalists failing to cover stories that are important to their community because their newsrooms don’t accurately represent the demographics they serve, and as a result, are unaware of these events. 
While the Daily Trojan is a majority-minority newsroom, it currently and historically lacks adequate black and Latino representation among its staff and editors. 
As a result, the newspaper sometimes fails to cover events put on by the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs or El Centro Chicano, if only because its editors simply aren’t always aware of their full presence on campus. Through meetings with leaders at these organizations, the Daily Trojan works to adequately report on these communities at USC, but it’s still an imperfect substitution for reporters and editors who actually represent those communities. 
The best news reporting is done when journalists develop relationships with leaders in the communities they cover. Readers are rightfully more likely to trust people who reflect their background and share details about the important stories they have to tell. When newsrooms reflect community diversity, marginalized populations are more likely to trust their local paper as a community resource rather than another powerful institution that doesn’t truly care to serve them. 
If news organizations want to claim they accurately report on the communities they cover, they must also show a commitment to accurately reflecting their communities in their newsrooms. 
Karan Nevatia is a sophomore writing about media ethics and literacy. He is also an associate managing editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “Dear Rita Skeeter,” runs every other Thursday.

When Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro was promoted to full-time professor of political science and gender and sexuality studies in December 2016, she also became the first full-time black female professor at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
“It was exciting to get the promotion, but I was shocked to find out that there had never been a black woman before promoted to full professor ever in our college because, of course, we’re the oldest college at USC,” Hancock Alfaro said. 
Hancock Alfaro said USC and all other universities should strive to recruit faculty and students from diverse backgrounds to improve everyone’s experiences. While the University has hosted mandatory race training, Hancock Alfaro said all departments must take more steps to determine what groups may be excluded from their programs and find ways to improve. 
“It benefits all students to know that expertise and knowledge reside in all communities, so there’s no community that is absent [of] expertise or absent [of] knowledge or technical skills,” Hancock Alfaro said. “I think, again, if you were to ask a bunch of students they’d be like ‘Of course that’s true.’ Living it out and really understanding it through experience is a different thing.” 
Nearly 20 years ago, Hancock Alfaro began researching welfare reform and realized she couldn’t just focus on welfare recipients’ race and gender. Instead, she applied an intersectional lens to her research to focus on how overlaps in identities -— such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender — affect her research subjects. 
Hancock Alfaro is currently finishing a research project on affordable housing for women of color in California. Next week, she will present her findings to the California State Legislature in Sacramento in hopes of helping Sen. Scott Wiener pass State Bill 50, which could offer more affordable housing options throughout the state.
Hancock Alfaro said using an intersectional lens allows her to add another layer to her research and make it more applicable. Since then, she has researched how various populations are affected by a number of topics like immigration, LGBTQ+ rights and affordable housing. 
“If you want to talk about intersectionality, you have to talk about Ange-Marie Hancock,” said Jane Junn, a professor in political science and gender studies who works with Hancock Alfaro. “I don’t think there’s any other way around it.” 
When Hancock Alfaro started her research, she said not many people knew the term “intersectionality.” She was one of the only people conducting research in the field. Though less so the case now that intersectionality has grown in popularity, Hancock Alfaro said students often think they understand the term based on incomplete definitions they find on social media.
“It’s actually a pretty cool feeling to know that you were an early adopter,” Hancock Alfaro said. “I think the challenge always comes, and I find this in my teaching a lot, that there’ll be a lot of folks who think they know what intersectionality is based on some YouTube video they saw or some tweet from Rowan Blanchard from the Disney Channel.” 
At USC, Hancock Alfaro also serves as a mentor to students. Former doctoral student Matthew Mendez Garcia said that having her as his adviser helped him feel more confident at USC and in pursuing research projects on diversity.
“Having a person of color was important because I think she understood that that would be part of my experience,” Mendez Garcia said. “She … understands the significance of having people of color in a doctoral program asking certain questions.” 
Hancock Alfaro said she hopes her research can help others and better their lives.
“I have a personality of a justice junkie for lack of a better way of saying it,” Hancock Alfaro said. “That’s certainly why I do what I do because I believe in justice, and I believe that everybody deserves access to resources and access to a life that’s got dignity.” 
This story is part of  the Daily Trojan’s special coverage for Black History Month. It will run periodically throughout February.

The President’s Culture Commission released an update on its ongoing mission to improve campus culture that detailed a new plan to engage with the USC community. The statement,  was released earlier this week by the 13 student and faculty representatives on the Commission.
The Commission was formed in November 2018 with the goal of improving campus culture by addressing University issues. Renee Smith-Maddox, associate dean of diversity, equity and inclusion, said the Task Force on Workplace Standards and Employee Wellness was a precursor to the formation of the Commission.
“The Commission, which was launched by [Interim] President [Wanda] Austin, was designed to build off of the work that the [Task Force] had done,” said Smith-Maddox, who is also a Commission member. “[Its goals are] to really start to think about how we focus on changing our culture … in a way that people know that we are turning things around.”  
The Commission is using a model from the Barrett Values Centre, an organization that helps leaders build value-driven societies, to implement a campus-wide survey to assess the University’s values.
“We [will] have different experts come our way and talk to us about organizational change and culture change,” Smith-Maddox said.
According to the statement, the Working Group on University Culture comprises a “body of 23 individuals who represent a broad cross-section of the University.” As of now, the Working Group collaborating with the Commission to listen to the community’s ideas for change. 
The Commission’s work will occur in three phases, the statement read.
For the first phase, which will run through May, the Working Group on University Culture will partner with Barrett to engage the USC community. Draft versions of the campus-wide survey will be administered to test groups.
In the second phase, which is projected to take place from May to August, the Commission will refine the survey based on its findings in preparation for a University-wide rollout.
In the third phase, which will run from September to December, the entire University community will be invited to participate in the survey. The results will help the Commission define a set of values which will guide the University’s future actions and policies. In-person discussions and online collaborations will supplement the data from the survey, according to the statement.
“The goals of the President’s Culture Commission are essential for the University moving forward,” Undergraduate Student Government President Debbie Lee, who serves as a student representative on the Commission, wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “USC is in need of a shift in culture, and I hope this group will be able to formulate tangible, thoughtful next steps. I’m excited to use the values assessment tool as a first step, and I look forward to laying down the foundations for a university culture we all hope to see.”

Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, spoke about the current state of the International Criminal Court Wednesday at a discussion hosted by the Gould School of Law and the International Law and Relations Organization.
Nearly 50 students and faculty attended the event. The discussion, titled “The Future of International Criminal Justice: Challenges & Opportunities,” was moderated by Hannah Garry, a clinical professor of law and director at the International Human Rights Clinic at Gould. 
Though Dicker began his career in international law, he said he wasn’t expecting to experience many events that he later became involved in. 
“If you had told me, ‘Well, the president of Serbia will be tried by international courts [and] the president of Liberia will be tried by another international court,’ I would have asked you if a science fiction magazine had merged with a law book because it was totally, totally unforeseeable,” Dicker said.  
Dicker, who served as an international attorney and worked with numerous governments, discussed the experiences he had while working with governments to increase legal accountability for war crimes. 
Dicker said he wanted to go into international human rights law because he was inspired by a personal search for justice and altruism.  
“I feel for these communities most affected by [crimes against humanity] that have no other recourse of justice,” Dicker said. “Fair trials matter … I believe fervently in the importance of a fair trial and what it guarantees.” 
The conversation revolved around the establishment of the International Criminal Court, a judicial body independent of the United Nations. Dicker said he believes that the United Nations has too much power, and thus the International Criminal Court is important for holding it accountable.  
Garry said she appreciated Dicker’s message of optimism about the future of the international courts system.
“I thought [the talk] was a really comprehensive and concise overview of international criminal justice and where we’re at today,” Garry said. “I think that Mr. Dicker really provided rich insight into the evolution of international criminal justice with his personal experience … behind the movement pushing for accountability, and has provided a somewhat hopeful perspective for the future.” 
During the event, one student asked, “What impact has [the International Criminal Court] had on international relations overall?” 
Dicker responded that the court helps hold nations accountable for major crimes. He concluded the discussion with a call to action, encouraging students in the audience to work toward justice and hold leaders accountable. 
“There will be plenty of individuals like yourselves that are committed, involved and active in trying to apply legal norms in situations where crimes occur,” Dicker said. “It’s going to be tough; it’s not 1998 anymore. Yet, there’s a demand for accountability that neither President Putin, President Erdoan or President Trump will be able to upend.”  
Vera Zhao, a sophomore majoring in communication and law, history and culture, attended the event for her “Law, Atrocity Crimes, and Transitional Justice” class and said she appreciated the discussion’s global perspective. 
“It’s important to encourage more international corporations and not just focus on certain countries,” Zhao said.
