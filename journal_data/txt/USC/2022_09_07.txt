At last week’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, chief financial officer Brian Stowe announced that a funding workshop would be held Wednesday for registered student organizations to learn about the funding department and how their organizations can get financing. The workshop, which will be the first of its kind, has been postponed to Sept. 14 due to scheduling conflicts and will be held monthly for the rest of the semester. 
Senator Maria Barun also presented the projects and goals she hopes to accomplish by the end of the semester, including establishing a better connection with students and “leaving a reasonable impact.” Senators will begin tabling at Trousdale Parkway every Monday starting next week to increase senate visibility among students. 
“Senators often are kind of disconnected from the students; they’re not necessarily representing the student body in many ways,” Barun said. “The first step that I’ve done in trying to make us more connected with students is asking the senators to step into their classes and talk to the class about ‘who I am and how they can reach out to me.’”
Barun is also working with the external affairs committee’s initiative to organize a Black History Month restaurant crawl in February hosting local Black-owned restaurants. Last Saturday, Barun and chief of external affairs Monica Rodriguez met with three restaurants in the Los Angeles area to discuss quotes and timing. The restaurant crawl will be held on campus, so students will not have to travel to the restaurants themselves.
The external affairs committee is also collecting old recreation center athletic equipment from University programs and donating them to the community. Currently, the committee is in talks with the Board of Trustees, which owns all of the old equipment.
“I think a lot of the senators’ goals are unachievable,” Barun said. “That’s why all the projects that I’m trying to focus on are ones that have started in the past but weren’t quite able to reach completion.”
Barun is also working on a partnership with USCard services to integrate student ID cards into Apple Wallet. She’s also researching how other universities have implemented policies to provide free washing machine usage, as she’s interested in bringing about a similar change at USC.
During last week’s senate meeting, president Hannah Woodworth announced USG’s progress with organizing a shuttle service between USC and Los Angeles International Airport. The shuttle will be available for all undergraduate students to sign up for through Eventbrite.
“The big obstacle we are running into right now is securing a bus vendor because it needs to be a USC-preferred vendor,” Woodworth said. “Our current goal is to have the program up and running and fully utilized by fall break.”
The shuttle will run at 30-minute intervals on a first-come-first-serve basis and will be able to take up to 50 students on each ride.
“Our current priorities are on the logistical ends,” Woodworth said. “We’re making sure that we’re marketing it and reaching the students who need it the most, which are particularly first-year and out-of-state students.”
Chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias is working with the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly on an advocacy initiative to expand the racial and ethnic categories on USC’s Common App to be more inclusive of their ethnic identity. There is currently a petition on change.org that has 77 signatures at the time of publication.
USG also has several upcoming programming events: MENASA will host a Henna night Thursday at 6 p.m. in the MENA lounge in the Center for Black Cultural & Student Affairs in the Student Union Building, the Latinx Student Assembly will host Welcome Back Carne Asadas on Friday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Founders’ Park and the Military Associated Student Assembly will lead a stairclimb to honor those who lost their lives on 9/11 at Cromwell Field at 9 a.m.

While my friends were chilling by the beach or tailgating their asses off over Labor Day weekend, I found myself frantically going through Daily Trojan staff applications — which are due next Friday for staff writers for those interested. Yet again, I had brought my job home with me. 
As an editor, it’s honestly inevitable. But, considering that I spent the majority of my time working on assignments and planning out my pitch sheet on a national holiday dedicated to the American organized labor movement’s achievement with the 40-hour work week, I began to question my habits.
The pandemic forced nearly everyone to adapt to some form of remote or hybrid work, but despite the spotlight moving away from the coronavirus, workers and students alike have kept their work habits from the pandemic. According to The Washington Post staff writer Andrew Van Dam and research done by economists José María Barrero, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis, “Almost two-thirds of work was done remotely [at the height of the pandemic]. But it has since stabilized at an extraordinarily high level: Around a third of work was done remotely in the United States in 2021 and 2022.”
Working remotely may have its benefits (such as flexibility and cost efficiency), but let’s stop bringing our job home with us. I know that I’m preaching to the choir and it’s a lot easier said than done, though.
For many, work is a Slack message or email away. I can’t count the number of times I’ve told myself, “that pesky red notification badge must go, just open one more email” and found myself at my desk until ungodly hours.
California might be contemplating the four-day workweek, but we still find ourselves in longer workdays. Los Angeles Times writer Joe Robinson found that, “70% of remote workers say they work on weekends, and nearly half report they work longer than when they were at the physical job site.” This is a statistic I’m all too familiar with but don’t have the mental or physical capacity for. 
By now, everyone should know the correlation between overworking yourself and debility. If you don’t, here are some terrifying statistics that might convince you to put a bit more effort into working just a bit less.
About 83% of workers in the U.S. suffer from chronic stress related to work, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health can back me up when I tell you that your workaholic behavior is detrimental to your wellbeing. They even found that this overworking behavior doesn’t increase your productivity one bit in comparison to those who abide by the 40-hour week.
On top of that, the World Health Organization recorded an average of 745,000 deaths globally each year due to stroke and heart conditions that were attributed to long working hours.
Despite all this information circulating around like a broken record, we have yet to learn our lesson. Many of us already have boundary issues in our personal relationships; we can’t afford to add professional boundaries to that list. 
I’m obligated to tell my staff to keep their notifications on so that I can reach them, but to everyone inside and outside of the Daily Trojan, create designated times and areas to check your work emails and messages. When you have the day off, actually take the day off. Go to the beach. See a movie. Sleep in. Pick up a self-help book on productivity and breaking away from overworking. Whatever you do, give yourself a real break. 
We all have our respective responsibilities, but we won’t get anything done properly as a pent-up, burnt-out ball of stress. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but it’s okay to take some time off. Your well-being comes first. It doesn’t matter that we are only on the third week of classes. It doesn’t matter if you’re a senior facing an existential crisis about what to do with your life once your undergraduate career ends. We all have our limits, and surpassing them won’t do you any good. Your well-being comes first, so if you’re feeling overwhelmed, please know that you’ll be okay after taking a well-deserved break. Just remember to update your boss or professor and don’t put off those assignments indefinitely.

This past weekend saw the worst of the heat wave scorching California, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing Monday with the Daily Trojan. As the Rice vs. USC football game opened the 2022-23 football season Saturday, temperatures in Los Angeles peaked at 97 degrees Fahrenheit, before soaring the next day to 100 degrees. 
Fortunately, there was no significant increase in heat-related emergencies among spectators at Saturday’s game, according to Van Orman.
“I don’t think, generally, we actually had anything that was more significant than other games,” Van Orman said. “We’re glad of that. I think sending a warning out was helpful because we did see people taking precautions.”
Prior to Saturday’s game, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs Monique S. Allard advised attendees in an email Friday to prevent heat-related illness “by drinking plenty of water and sports drinks to stay hydrated, wearing loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing, staying in the shade, avoiding physical exertion between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and using a hat to protect your face from the sun.” Van Orman said the University would not pursue overarching mitigation strategies to combat the heat wave, such as moving classes to Zoom.
“When we think about brief periods, 15 to 20 minutes moving to class, for most people that would be an acceptable thing,” Van Orman said. “For a lot of people, it really is about the intensity of the exercise you’re doing, and the amount of time you need to spend outside without being in an air-conditioned environment.”
While the heat wave has likely peaked, the National Weather Service projected it will continue until Friday. Van Orman warned of the “cumulative effect” of heat, which may lead to heat stroke or heat-related illness.
“The more days the heat wave goes on, the more people can start to feel the impact of the heat,” she said.
Van Orman listed four precautions which she recommends students take against the heat wave: first, avoiding the heat as much as possible; second, increasing daily fluid intake to at least double the normal amounts; third, avoiding exercising in the heat; and last, noting that alcohol acts as a diuretic and exacerbates dehydration.
USC is also experiencing a peak in coronavirus cases, which is expected at this time of year, Van Orman said. 
“Historically, 14 to 21 days after the start of classes is when we see cases start to spike,” Van Orman said.
Los Angeles County saw a continued decrease in new cases after climbing to 8,675 in early July; Van Orman said she expects a similar decrease at USC “in the next week.” 
169 people tested positive from Aug. 28 to Sep. 3 at Student Health, and 280 additional students reported positive tests taken at home. 
“The week before, the numbers were about 50% higher,” Van Orman said. “So we already are starting to see a little bit of a decline.”
As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends updated boosters targeting the omicron and BA.5 variants. Distribution at the federal level began the day before, when the FDA approved the shots; Van Orman said it is “not clear yet when exactly the boosters will arrive” at the University and be made available for students, but they are anticipated to arrive sometime this week or early next week. USC Pharmacies closed its booster clinics on Thursday and will remain closed until the new boosters arrive. 
In the meantime, Van Orman emphasized the importance of coronavirus precautions. Antigen tests for the coronavirus are available at Student Health, local drugstores and all residence hall customer service centers. Isolation housing remains available to students required to quarantine.
Student Health is also continuing to make monkeypox testing available, as well as access to treatment. Vaccines, however, will not be distributed at the University in the foreseeable future, according to Van Orman.
“At this point, the vaccine is not being made available to healthcare providers,” Van Orman said. “It’s only being distributed through public health channels: at either public health clinics or at clinics that have been designated by public health, so we’re not anticipating that changing, because of the shortage of supply, for several months.”
As of Friday, the CDC reported 19,962 total confirmed cases of monkeypox or orthopoxvirus in the United States, 3,833 of which are in California. Van Orman said data on monkeypox cases at USC, including the total number of cases, will not be publicized as with the coronavirus.
“We don’t necessarily need to know because it really isn’t posing a risk to the general community,” Van Orman said. “It’s really only for the very closest of contacts … We just know that … we’re seeing in the general community small numbers of cases.”
In a later communitywide email sent Monday, Student Health listed a number of mental health resources in acknowledgment of World Suicide Prevention Day this Saturday.
“As an academic institution that prides itself on intellectual rigor, USC brings many opportunities for tackling challenging work; this can sometimes also carry unintended stressors,” the email read. “We want you to know that USC values the health and well-being of our community members as our highest priority, and when you need help, resources are available to support you.”
Resources include the 24/7 phone line for USC Student Health at 213-740-WELL (9355), the three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Line at 988, online modules and psychiatric screening opportunities, among other resources.

It’s not every day that you get shoulder-checked when walking down Trousdale Parkway. Imagine getting absolutely bodied by a random stranger en route to your next class — those types of events really stick in your mind and set a pretty poor tone for the day. It causes a bit of a scene, too. People take glances at you, shocked and appalled, on the ground, but no one seems to really do anything or help you up. Regardless, you get up — perhaps a bit winded — get your shit together and carry on with your day. 
Let’s casually escalate this story — say you get hit by a car. A “get up and go about your day” kind of affair goes out the window. Alongside just recovering physically, an unnecessarily absurd amount of paperwork that you need to manage comes your way. Considering finances, the average cost of an injury from a car-related accident in 2020 ranged from $4,700 to $101,000, depending on severity. The road to recovery — both physical and financial — can take months, even years. 
So, from a driver’s perspective, it seems pretty clear that we only lose from hitting someone — and that’s not even considering insurance rates, license suspensions, physical damage to the car and physiological stressors related to driving. That begs the question: Why is it so hard to avoid accidents with folks on the road? Maybe it’s a manifestation of anger and frustration, a severe lack of sleep or an ex tempting you with an unnecessary reunion. 
Whatever the answer may be, as obvious as it sounds, it’s important to be conscientious about those we share the road with. 
In Los Angeles, particularly near USC, there are a number of groups that can really tempt some intrusive thoughts taking hold of the wheel: small wheels (skaters, cyclists, scooterists or whatever they’re called), buses, ride-sharers, pedestrians.
There has been a noticeable increase in bicycling given increasing gas prices and ease in terms of storage and security compared to a car. But despite the presence of bike lanes in certain areas around campus, it’s important to still acknowledge bicycles and other small wheels as equals on the road. If the speed is that much of a bother, simply pass the person when clear — end of discussion. There’s no need to aggressively drive these riders off the road or into a parked car. 
If you are driving behind a bus, merge to get around it. Bus lines are literally designed to have stops, so please don’t whine and scream when it stops in front of you as you’re tailing it. Also know that these buses have their next stop to get to and need to merge back into traffic to make sure everyone gets where they need to go relatively on time. Again, pretty obvious, but show some respect and make space or merge away from a bus leaving a stop.
A personal quarrel I have with ride-sharers is their choice to simply stop in the middle of the road to perform a task. Apart from that, I respect the hustle and the drive to get that bag. In these cases, it may be difficult to execute a pass, especially on the thin residential streets around campus, so this one goes out to the ride-sharers themselves. Quite literally, if there’s any spot that you can pull over to the side, do so — that’s it.
Pedestrians — my favorite. My friends often call me “too empathetic” when it comes to letting people cross the road in front of me prior to turning or leaving a stop sign. However, I believe that this particular group should have a two-way deal with drivers. 
All drivers are ultimately pedestrians prior to taking the wheel, unless the law changed to let newborns drive. Therefore, it seems natural that the experiences of running across the street as the timer runs down or even jaywalking now and then are carried over to the driver’s side — but no. So, it’s a matter of patience and maybe a few choice words, but I’d rather take that than getting hit as an alternative. Also, just as you shouldn’t drive and text, don’t walk and text. If Noah could wait 40 days and 40 nights in his ride before getting off, your Tinder matches or your group chat drama can wait. The L.A. streets are tough to navigate as is; no one needs you to get in the way even more. 
The road is inherently made to be shared. It’s its own form of transportation — no need to gatekeep it.
Get home safe, besties.

Struggles with appearance never seemed to be an issue for traditional Disney princesses. Their issues were more with external antagonists: evil stepmothers, wicked witches and war-waging villains. The 1996 animated film “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” was the one film that, when I was growing up, felt like the internal conflict was central to the external one. 
Adapted from Victor Hugo’s novel of the same name, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” focuses on Quasimodo, a hunchbacked character who lives in the bell tower of Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral. His “master,” the Judge Minister of Justice Claude Frollo, caused the death of Quasimodo’s mother when Quasimodo was just a baby, and was forced to take Quasimodo in as a form of religious repentance. Frollo has an evil plan to rid Paris of all the Romani people and demands to Phoebus, the new Captain of the Guard, that the Romanis’ safe place, the Court of Miracles, be demolished. 
During the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo, Frollo and Phoebus encounter the beautiful Romani dancer, Esmeralda. All three of them develop varying levels of attraction to her, with Frollo experiencing a raging lust that he deems sinful. Enraged by this lust, Frollo orders that Esmeralda be found. Quasimodo and Phoebus must work together to save the woman they both love. 
The story is, of course, more complex than that. Above all, though, it’s an expression of what it means to be an outcast. Esmeralda is discriminated against for being Romani. Quasimodo is discriminated against for the visibility of his disability. It’s a theme that I felt a strong connection to, given that growing up I had (and still have) a slight hunch in my shoulders that has negatively affected my perception of self. “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” centers on the idea of the “problem body” and the societal and psychological implications for those affected.  
To be honest, I’d never try to compare my struggles with the subtle curve in my shoulders to Quasimodo’s hunchback. I’d hardly try to conflate my position — which, during a consultation, a doctor in Taiwan said was due to my consistently poor posture — with the severity of Quasimodo’s condition by birth.
Still, growing up I found a lot of core emotional relevance — and personal resonance — in Quasimodo, who was ostracized by French society at large for how he looked and developed deep insecurities as a result. As a girl, I wanted to be perceived as beautiful like Esmeralda, but I felt more like Quasimodo. 
I absolutely despised going into changing rooms because the three mirrors meant that I would see my side profile, including my hunched-over shoulders. It became normal for me to pull my shoulders forward whenever I was speaking to anyone, if only for the fact that it’d look like I was just extremely invested in the conversation and not that my head was unintentionally more distant from my shoulders than it was supposed to be.
Of course, my self-consciousness probably did magnify these insecurities. For the most part, I feel like most people thought I was simply “slouching” all the time, not knowing that it was an ever-present condition of mine. When I was younger, I was told to wear a back brace and do exercises standing against the wall to fix my hunched shoulders. For a period of time, I did wear a back brace, but it was so uncomfortable that it only furthered my unhappiness and deep sense of self-loathing.
In a world where having hunched shoulders immediately gave off the impression that I was unconfident, I began to feel more insecure. I remember people telling me “straighten your shoulders,” but I just couldn’t seem to. 
When I tried not to hunch over, I still felt like I looked abnormal. It got to the point where I would constantly wear a backpack even if I didn’t need one so that my hunched shoulders would look like they were the product of a heavy backpack, rather than my natural position. In photos, I would try to only have my front view featured and would always start comparing myself to people whose shoulders looked “normal.” 
The point of this isn’t to say “Oh, I’m just like Quasimodo,” because I’m not, and I think it would be insensitive and harmful to say so. The point is to talk about how representation in animation is so incredibly important. Quasimodo is far from the kind of idealized, proportional character one often sees in animation. To me, that meant something more truthful than Disney’s fairytale retellings. Seeing this character who felt like he could never be loved because of how he looked; that spoke to me on an incredibly personal level. 
The moment of devastation when Quasimodo realized that Esmeralda, the love of his life and the only one who had ever shown him kindness, was in love with the traditionally attractive Captain Phoebus was incredibly difficult to watch. I think it was because of the way that the small inkling of hope for love Quasimodo had was erased by the physical reminder that he couldn’t measure up to a romantic ideal.
As a college student, this position of mine is still one of my greatest insecurities. As graduation looms closer, I dread the thought of just walking in my graduation gown because I feel like everyone will be judging my appearance. Knowing that there are others who have experienced similar struggles, though, with characters like Quasimodo, makes me feel a lot less alone.

Ken Carson’s concert on September 4th drew quite a crowd, with the line to enter the Fonda Theater wrapping around the block hours before the doors opened. When 7 o’clock hit, the doors flew open and fans eagerly flooded the venue. Many rushed to the merch line while others rushed to be front row at Carson’s first show in Los Angeles. 
With the lights dimming, the fans overlapping talking quickly turned to cheers when the DJ on stage hit play on the first song to start the show. “Beno!” by Playboi Carti filled the venue followed by several songs from Carti’s “Whole Lotta Red” album such as “Stop Breathing” and “Die4Guy”. 
Carson and other Opium record labelmates stopped at the historice Fonda Theater on their X-Man Tour. Ken Carson, along with the concert staff was able to create a safe and enjoyable experience for all those present. 
The X-Man Tour is  Carson’s first headlining tour, allowing the Atlanta native to showcase his abilities as the main act for once. Fans across the country had the chance to see the chemistry between  Carson and Destroy Lonely in person. The duo, both signed to Playboi Carti’s label Opium, released their own projects over the summer, with Carson dropping “X” and Destroy Lonely releasing “NO STYLIST.” Both artists use heavy basses in the background with a rapping style reminiscent of Carti and Lil Uzi Vert.  
Carson, born Kenyatta Frazier Jr., was the first artist to be signed to rapper Playboi Carti’s new and promising label Opium. Carson continues to prove his worth in the rap game since his breakout 2020 EP titled “Teen X.” Chart-topping singles like “Yale” and “Meds,” only influenced Carson to continue releasing projects using harsh trap beats with a quick paced, stop-and-start rapping style or a more mellow tone. 
In July 2021, Carson dropped his first album titled “Project X,” proving to be more successful than his previous EP. “Project X” was crucial for Carson because it came with hits such as “Run+Ran” and “Hella,” which took no time to make their way up the rap charts. It was then with a strong and loyal fan base, Carson was able to land an opening spot on Playboi Carti’s “King Vamp” tour. This trial run for Carson solidified the following the rapper has across the United States. From Nashville to Atlanta, you could hear fans rap his breakout single “Yale” word for word. 
With the crowd riled up from the Playboi Carti set, Destroy Lonely took the stage. The instrumental to Destroy Lonely’s “JETLGGD” blasted throughout the Fonda. He performance revolved around songs from his new album “NO STYLIST.” Destroy Lonely performed his most popular songs such as “Bane” and “NO STYLIST,” invigorating the crowd with energy.
 During his performance, mosh pits were ever present on the floor section of the venue. Despite the constant energy, it seems as if his tardiness forced him to plow through his entire setlist. There was little to no break between songs and minimal interaction. However, the setlist itself entirely made up for it. It seems as if Destroy Lonely was able to pinpoint the exact songs that would cause a successful performance, because, although tired, the crowd was able to match his energy. 
 Carson rushed in right after, performing “Go,” a hit song from his most recent album “X”. Much like Destroy Lonely, it appeared as if the entire show Carson was on a time crunch. The “Teen X” rapper flooded the crowd with song after song, with little to no words in between. However, much like Destroy Lonely,   Carson  created an enjoyable atmosphere by performing fan favorites such as “Run+Ran,’’ “Yale,” and “Teen Bean.”
Throughout his performance, Carson prioritized the mosh pits in the crowd, consistently demanding for them to stay open. In response, the crowd matched his energy by stage diving, while keeping a few mosh pits open throughout the venue.  Carson’s performance ended abruptly, as almost by venue demand, when the lights turned off three words into his last performance. Carson apologized to the crowd and walked off stage, bringing the X-Man Tour’s September 4th date to an end.
 Despite the grind of a 47-date tour,  Carson took no breaks and hit the studio. Only 9 months after the “King Vamp” tour, Carson dropped his biggest album to date titled “X”. 
“X” contains 20 songs including hits such as “MDMA” and “Freestyle 2” and includes collaborations with artists such as Destroy Lonely and Homixide Gang, who also are signed to Opium. Shortly following the release of “X,”  Carson announced The X-Man Tour, a team-up tour with Destroy Lonely. 
Overall, both performances by Destroy Lonely and  Carson lacked crowd interaction and seemed to be on a time crunch; however, the setlist by both artists served as a rescuing factor. Destroy Lonely and  Carson’s ability to perform their fan favorites is why this show went from forgettable to memorable.

All throughout Labor Day Weekend, Los Angelenos everywhere searched for shade and water whenever they could as the ongoing heatwave sweltered. 
The heat wave brought record temperatures throughout Southern California and is expected to continue through Thursday. The L.A. region hit temperatures in the triple digits at several points during the holiday weekend. 
USC Student Health sent a universitywide email Thursday addressing the excessive heat warning and providing tips and advice for managing the heat. 
“During daylight hours, we encourage our faculty, staff, students and visitors to stay well hydrated, limit physical activity and stay indoors or in shaded areas to prevent heat illnesses,” the email read. 
Student Health also provided a list of air-conditioned buildings that would be open over the weekend, including the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Student Union Building, Sample Hall, Bovard Administration Building, USC Bookstore, Campus Development and Facilities Building, Heritage Hall and McKay Center. 
Whether they were used to the heat or not, this weekend’s blistering temperatures surprised and wore on community members. 
“I’m actually very surprised about the heatwave,” said Lauren Pickard, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “I’m from San Diego, so you’ll get at least like one or two days where it’s above 100, but not like four days in a row.”
Elizabeth Finley, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering, said she felt students were left to protect themselves from the heat with little help from the University.
“I feel like there should be things put out there by the University, like maybe extra water bottles students can pick up somewhere if they’re thirsty, because you don’t want anyone fainting on campus and getting heat exhaustion,” Finley said.
The heatwave coincided with the inaugural football game of the season, which took place at the open-air L.A. Memorial Coliseum Saturday. The USC football team sparred with — and defeated — the Rice University Owls amid temperatures in the high 90s. 
Pickard, who is also a USC Helene, had to be at the Coliseum by 12:30 p.m. the day of the game for gate call, but said she wasn’t too bothered by the heat. 
“I’ve been drinking more water than usual and, at the game, I had one water bottle, two frozen bottles and then a gallon, and that’s what got me through it,” Pickard said. “But I don’t know—I’m used to the heat.”
Southern California has been suffering from power outages induced by the excessive heat, as people cranked the air conditioning up and used more energy staying indoors. The California Independent System Operator called for a statewide Flex Alert throughout the heatwave, meaning residents are encouraged to voluntarily conserve energy due to high demand. Peak times for energy consumption are from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. and people were warned of potential blackouts. Tuesday marked the seventh consecutive day of Flex Alerts.
Samuel Moreno, an employee at the USC Village Target, said he has been going out more since there’s usually a power outage at his home. 
Moreno said the heatwave didn’t really change his routine in any way “because I do feel like it’s been the same weather for a really long time or it has been really hot,” he said. 
The blistering heat brought with it other challenges for community members; Evan Piche, an employee at the USC Village Trader Joe’s, said the heat has been interfering with his sleep. 
“It’s really unfortunate because my house, it’s a bit of an older house, so I’m always just kind of waking up in the middle of the night,” Piche said. “I have to essentially put my dogs and cats in the only room in the house with AC and it’s not my room.”
As temperatures increased, some USC area dwellers also felt their moods dampen. 
“I feel totally sucked dry of my energy,” said Rachel Wood, a Lululemon Educator at the USC Village. “I’ve just been spending a lot of time inside, sitting in front of the AC, taking cool showers, just trying to stay out of the sun. I also wear a hat and try to wear lighter clothes.”

Women’s soccer defeated No. 6 Texas Christian University 3-0 in their home opener on Thursday.
With fans scurrying for shade in the Los Angeles heat, USC swiftly went ahead of the current Big 12 Champions. Early on, the team jumped into first gear with numerous touches and great networking among the midfield. This rapid touch and move system implemented by head coach Jane Alukonis led to the afternoon’s first goal. 
With a sense of good luck and grit to continue fighting for the ball, the first goal for the Trojans came only three minutes after the starting whistle. Sophomore forward Simone Jackson pushed through the left flank with only the goal in her sight. Her run past three defenders led her to an open shot at goal, which she converted into the 1-0 lead for the Trojans. Senior forward Croix Bethune would end up with the assist for that action after passing Jackson the ball outside the box. 
The Horned Frogs would later get their chances at goal with 4 corner kicks in the first half, but that would not be enough to stop the Trojan attack. Before the end of halftime, the referee issued the Trojans a foul outside the TCU 18-yard box. Without hesitation, Bethune planted the ball on the spot and scored the second goal past TCU’s junior goalkeeper Lauren Kellet. Bethune would later close off the night with a third goal, securing her brace. 
“It feels great especially [because] we didn’t start off as hot or as well as we wanted to,” Bethune said. “Having our first home game and coming in and destroying our opponent 3-0, it’s a great start to what we have in the future going on.” 
Bethune praised the team for embracing new coaching staff and acclimating to a new gameplan.
“We pretty much have the same team with a couple of people that have left, but same team, different coaches,” Bethune said. “We just bring them in as they’re our own family and adjust to their mindset and their plan. Adversity always happens, so that’s one thing you have to be, you have to adapt to adversity.”
Coach Alukonis showed excitement after achieving her second win as USC head coach and first on home soil.
“It feels awesome. It was kind of funny getting my footing out here because even though I have been at UCLA, we never played here, so we were always at a neutral site,” Alukonis said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I knew that being on our home field, our players would turn up and give the best that they possibly could for their families, for the program and for the team. I’m just very proud.” 
Alukonis said that her gameplan stayed true to the traditional USC offensive-heavy mindset, but with a focus on keeping the Horned Frogs off the scoreboard. 
“I think in the DNA of the Trojans, it’s always the slogan ‘Fight on!,’ hardworking players with a lot of grit,” Alukonis said. “We want to sustain that, we want to keep up our attacking firepower that goes with the history of the program, but I think we tightened up defensively a bit. We really really wanted a shut-out, we want all shut-outs moving forward, but I felt like every player stayed focused for 100% of the game.” 
Alukonis and her team hope to continue their winning mentality in their upcoming away match against California State University, Northridge Thursday. Kick-off is at 7 p.m.

As I sat down on Labor Day to write this column, a bead of sweat dripped down my nose and onto my mousepad. I used my T-shirt to do what I had been doing all day and wiped my face down. The heat wave that began Aug. 31 brought record-breaking temperatures to Los Angeles. Downtown  hit 103 F on Sunday and the heat wave is expected to last through Thursday.  
The increased humidity is making it even more unbearable. As I write this at 2 p.m. on Monday, it’s 99 F outside but feels closer to 108 F with the 38% humidity. 
The football, soccer, cross country and water polo teams all competed outside in these record-breaking temperatures this weekend — with football, soccer and water polo getting dominant victories as their seasons have now kicked off. 
I always marvel at an athlete’s ability to compete in such intense weather. Wearing football pads and running around from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the middle of a heatwave is no joke. Luckily for the football and soccer team, both Soni McAlister Field and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum use real grass instead of artificial turf – which can get up to 70 F hotter than grass. USC’s other athletic fields, including Cromwell Field and Brittingham Field, aren’t as well suited to the heat as each are equipped with synthetic turf. 
Not only is synthetic turf hotter than grass, it is also more dangerous for student athletes as well. The chances of suffering a non-contact lower extremity injury on a synthetic turf field are 28% higher than on a natural grass field. Additionally, contact between an open wound and the field has the potential to cause infection. 
While artificial turf is much easier to maintain and eliminates the need for insecticides with harmful chemicals, it imposes clear dangers to athletes. Additionally, replacing natural grass fields with artificial turf is harmful to the climate for a number of reasons. 
Artificial turf often uses recycled tires as an infill to hold the grass in place and provide cushion for the athletes. However, with a variety of chemicals — including zinc and lead — often found in tires, athletes are at a greater risk of being exposed to carcinogens when playing on turf. Using recycled tires also leads to the spread of microplastics, which can cause lung damage and even cancer. 
The harmful chemicals used in synthetic turf can also harm wildlife, as stormwater runoff can carry zinc and other pollutants into nearby bodies of water, contributing to the already overwhelmingly increasing pollution from plastic that already kills over 1 million marine animals per year. 
With no ability to drain rainwater, artificial turf fields can also cause local storm systems to build up and overflow — requiring flow control mechanisms and water detention systems. This requires digging up soil, which in turn releases stored carbon into the atmosphere from the microorganisms living beneath the ground. The production of artificial turf also requires fossil fuels.
The production of the materials used in turf, such as synthetic fibers made of nylon, polypropylene or polyethylene, requires burning fossil fuels further increasing the carbon footprint of installing artificial turf fields. Plus, all turf surfaces must be replaced every eight to 10 years, causing this harmful production process to repeat. 
Artificial turf blocks soil access for burrowing insects, taking away the habitats of species that are dramatically declining in population. I was surprised to find out that 40% of insect species are declining in number and a third are endangered. The rate of insect extinction is eight times that of mammals, birds and reptiles. Insects are essential to the world’s ecosystem as food, pollinators and nutrient recyclers, and artificial turf  — on athletic fields or in backyards or wherever it may be used — is only contributing to their decline.  
So why are we using turf instead of natural grass for some of our athletic fields? Well, Southern California, as seen in the current heat wave, can be pretty dry. Rainfall is decreasing and the precipitation levels can’t keep up with the increasing evaporation levels. In short, L. A. is drying up and isn’t being watered quickly enough. 
Unfortunately, because it’s so dry and precipitation is declining, it makes it difficult to store water. Having a steady supply of water is crucial — we use it in so many different ways every day. One of them, which is certainly lower on the list than many of water’s uses, is lawn and field maintenance. 
Beginning in June, the city began limiting how frequently residents could water their lawns. In August, a list of L.A.’s biggest “water wasters” was leaked, exposing Kim Kardashian, Kevin Hart and Sylvestor Stallone as guilty of that dehydrating superlative. 
Maintaining athletic fields requires a lot of water, certainly more than the average Angeleno’s lawn. So, to some, perhaps prioritizing an athletic field is “water waster” behavior.
One of the most defining characteristics of climate change is that its hand is in every pot. There are few obvious answers to mitigating its effects, such as requiring those in charge of handling decisions about athletic fields (or lawns) to weigh out the environmental impact of managing their facilities. It’s just a question of priority.
