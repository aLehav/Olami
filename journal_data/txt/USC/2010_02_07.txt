For the past few years, USC has earned the honor of being the university with the largest international student population, but competition — even for this large number of spots — may be getting tougher.
The undergraduate applicant pool for the graduating class of 2014 has seen a steep increase this application season in the number of international applications and an even more dramatic increase in the number of applications from China.
According to the USC Office of Admission, the number of international applicants has risen by 22 percent this year. The number of Chinese international applicants, however, is up by three times that, rising 66 percent.
“That’s not an uncommon occurrence,” said Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission. “The applications have been increasing from international students at a very steady pace for several years now.”
Brunold noted that this increase is not specific to USC.
“I believe that it is consistent with other universities. I do think that there is a general sense among many American colleges and universities that China is a good place to go recruit students,” Brunold said. “I think that this growing trend of China is going to be something that will be with us for a while.”
Still, Brunold attributed the steep rise to applications to USC from Chinese applications to an increased outreach effort by USC Admissions.
“There’s always been a lot of interest from Chinese students at our graduate level,” he said. “But more recently, China has really taken over the top spot in our freshman recruiting.”
While the number of applications might be higher, Brunold said the percentage of Chinese applicants admitted to USC has remained similar to the overall average of acceptances over the past two years. For the 2012 graduating class, 14.5 percent of Chinese applicants were admitted, and 29 percent of Chinese applicants were admitted into the 2013 graduating class, compared to an overall admissions rate of 24 percent for the class of 2013.
Though Brunold expects the number of applicants from China to continue to rise, he said the university does not necessarily plan on increasing enrollment.
“Every indication we have is that it will continue to rise. That also means though, just like with any other group of students, it is going to get more competitive. Whenever you have more applicants, there’s more competition,” Brunold said.
He added that the university is “very pleased” with having a freshmen international population around 10 to 12 percent, but that this is simply a “natural balance” and by no means a goal for the admission office.
According to Brunold, China tops the list of the five countries outside of the United States that send the most undergraduate applications to USC. The other four countries, in order, are South Korea, India, Canada and Taiwan.
Students from China who come to USC said the hands-on learning experience offered by American universities is a draw. Some also noted that USC is well-known in China, which helps it draw applicants.
Yingying Zhang, a graduate student studying computer science, completed her undergraduate degree in China before coming to the United States for graduate school. She said she believes the university system in the United States is very different from that of China, and she wanted to gain hands-on experience in her field of study.
“In my undergraduate university, our courses focus on theories, not implementation or practice. Some students just care about their grades, not real skills,” Zhang said, adding that she hopes to gain “skills and experience” at USC.
Ruoqi Zhou, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business), applied to many colleges, all in the United States, and believed that she would learn more at USC than back home in China.
“The United States’ environment and education is better for me to accomplish my dream,” said Zhou, who said she hopes to become a journalist.

Neighborhood students who dream of one day entering the Trojan family now have a little more support.
The USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a program aimed at helping neighborhood students continue on to college, recently received a $250,000 grant from the Kresge Foundation, an organization that awards money to non-profits in the fields of health, the environment, community development, arts and culture, education and human services.
NAI is a six-year program that starts during middle school. The program works with students to assure placement at colleges or universities.
The Kresge Foundation asked NAI to apply for the grant, according to NAI director Kim Thomas-Barrios. She said this is a reflection of the effectiveness of the NAI program.
“Having Kresge just ask to apply is monumental,” Thomas-Barrios said. “Kresge awarded us the fund and had a firm belief in our program; they were really impressed with our students.”
Thomas-Barrios said NAI plans to use the grant money to help fund a change to the program.
Because Foshay High School is changing its schedule from year-round to traditional, the students from Manual Arts High School and Foshay will not be taking NAI classes together for the first time in 20 years. This requires more funding, and the grant money will be used to cover these funds.
“We want to use this funding so that we can continue to provide the same level of services that we have had every year,” Thomas-Barrios said.
NAI students take some of their classes on the USC campus, taught by teachers from their high school. This gives them a chance to experience learning in a college environment and, hopefully, helps grow enthusiasm about going to college.
“We transport an entire population of high school students to the university for part of the day so that they are made to feel comfortable with the knowledge for admittance and persistence at a major university,” Thomas-Barrios said.
Though the NAI program is aimed at getting students into college, it has a particular focus on USC. If a student is admitted to USC after graduating from NAI, the student receives a full financial aid package from the university.
“It helped me get prepared for the whole switch from high school to college,” said Amarilis Bolanos, a USC sophomore who graduated from NAI in 2008. “I felt more prepared for my classes when I got to college.”
Luis Maldonado, USC freshman and NAI graduate, said NAI kept him motivated to do well in high school.
“I was impacted by not only the program but the people in the program; it gives students the opportunity to establish friendship and gave us an incentive to go to college,” he said. “It was a good program because it challenges us … The classes were held at USC and it gave us the feeling of a college environment.”
Maldonado emphasized the significance NAI has on the surrounding community.
“It helps kids find their paths, and that is important especially in low economic communities,” he said.

Beginning Monday, the campus will be blanketed with colorful fliers, pamphlets and posters as the candidates for Undergraduate Student Government begin vying for students’ votes.
Campaign period officially starts Monday. Until now, candidates have been doing research, talking to student groups to get a feel for the key issues on students’ minds, and have been barred from any sort of campaigning. But on Monday, it will be full steam ahead.
Though candidates for senatorial positions will be campaigning too, the bulk of the politicking will be done by the four presidential tickets.
Running for president and vice president this year: junior Christopher Cheng, currently USG’s director of outreach, and junior Nehi Ogbevoen; junior Dylan Dann, currently a Greek Senator, and junior Addison McCaleb; junior Andrew Matson, USG’s current Director of Academic Affairs, and sophomore Juan Orjuela; and junior Jonathan Munoz-Proulx and sophomore Ryan Walsh.
USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said students should expect a lot of “in-your-face material” when campaigning begins Monday.
“The whole point of the election is to be as big of a face as possible and to be a presence on campus,” Chan said.
Chan anticipates less controversy in this year’s race because of the revised Elections Code.
Last year, Elections Code violations led to the disqualification of one presidential ticket and created confusion among candidates and students. This year, the Elections Code has been changed to more clearly state the rules about posting campaign materials in the hope that, with a better understanding of the rules, candidates will have an easier time avoiding violations.
Specifically, the Elections Code prohibits posting on trees, the ground, buildings, Tommy Trojan or any other statue, trash cans, lampposts, telephone poles and parking structures. Candidates are also barred from advertising in chalk form and from posting any campaign materials in university housing.
Chan said this year’s candidates are being particularly careful to avoid violations.
“A lot of candidates are asking questions and being vocal about their plans and making sure that it is OK,” Chan said. “I think a lot of people are wary of being filed against and so they’re really conscientious of their actions.”
Students will have a chance to hear from all the candidates on Wednesday during the presidential debate, which will be held at 8:00 p.m. in Taper Hall. 
Emiko Suzuki, co-director of Elections and Recruitment, said the debate is an important opportunity for students to learn about the candidates’ platforms.
“It was pretty popular last year,” she said. “Hopefully people come to that.”
Overall, Suzuki said she is just hoping that the campaign and elections process runs smoothly.
“It’s a very stressful period because the candidates are trying to get their stuff out there and meet people,” Suzuki said. “We hope that this week won’t be too crazy … Everyone has been in good communication with each other so we just hope that continues.”
Voting begins Feb. 16.

A lot can change in two weeks.
The USC women’s basketball team was riding high 10 days ago after a convincing win over Oregon State.  Winners of five straight games, the Women of Troy had a firm grasp on second place in the conference and were poised to enter the national rankings.
Three losses later, the Women of Troy (13-9, 7-4) must now find a way to regroup after turning in the worst offensive performance in school history.  USC scored just 10 points in the first half before ultimately falling 77-39 to No. 2 Stanford.
“We got walloped by the second best team in the country,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.  “We were playing well against them defensively and we needed to hit our shots, especially early on, and we didn’t do that.”
The loss capped off a bad weekend for USC, which gave away a winnable game at California before running into a buzz saw at Stanford (21-1, 11-0).
The first 20 minutes were full of missed opportunities for USC.  Stanford was largely ineffective on offense for much of the first half, but the Women of Troy were unable to take advantage.  USC missed 28 of its 31 field goal attempts in the first half.
“I thought our defense was good, but they are a very strong, smart team, and it was just going to be a matter of time before they figured it out,” Cooper said.
One of the few bright spots for USC was the play of redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos.  Gemelos was active in her second game back for the Women of Troy, attacking the basket and finishing with a team-high 13 points and six rebounds.
“This weekend definitely was bittersweet,” Gemelos said.  “I wish we could have come up here and earned two wins instead of the losses. But it definitely felt great to get out there and finally play,”
USC scrapped and fought all game against a much larger opponent but could not overcome one of its worst shooting performances in memory.  The Women of Troy finished the game shooting under 20 percent.
Sophomore guard Ashley Corral shot 1 of 11 from the field and finished with just four points, nearly 13 points below her season average.
Three players for Stanford collected double-doubles including Junior Kayla Pedersen who finished with game highs of 18 points and       14 rebounds.
Stanford ended the first half on an 18-2 run and took a 29-10 lead into the break.  The Cardinal outrebounded USC 59-32.
“We have to put things back on track,” Cooper said.  “We are going to go home and prepare for a difficult game on the road at UCLA.”
With the loss, USC fell to third place in the conference behind Stanford and UCLA.  The Women of Troy take on UCLA next week at Pauley Pavilion.
Wow, what a beat down.  Just like football.  I’m glad that your coach didn’t use any profanity in the post game press conference.

It’s one of the most cliché phrases in sports: Play one game at a time.
But for the No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team (7-3, 5-2), tasked with a Friday night match against the No. 9 UC Santa Barbara Gauchos (4-7, 4-4), that simple mentality proved to make the difference as the team tried to regain its winning ways.
“It’s very important to take each game one at a time because every time we play we have the potential to play better than the last,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said.
On a road trip that saw the Trojans lose two heartbreaking five-set matches, it is only fitting the team hit its stride again with a five-set thriller. In a see-saw battle that saw neither team claim two straight sets, the Trojans relied on a complete team effort and late-game heroics to outlast the Gauchos (30-27, 22-30, 30-24,        26-30, 15-10).
For much of the match, the Trojans were led by the typical contributions of sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and junior opposite Murphy Troy. Ciarelli paced the team with 18 kills, nine digs and three blocks, and Troy, the team’s co-captain, pitched in with 16 kills, seven blocks and five digs.
Yet while the team got huge performances from two of its primary leaders, the Trojans snapped their two-game skid thanks in large part to a variety of players who stepped up against UCSB. Junior outside hitter Tri Bourne posted double-digits in kills and digs, with 13 and 15 respectively. Senior middle blocker Hunter Current keyed the team with seven crucial blocks and a team-high .417 hitting percentage. And Clay Knapp, who made his first career start at libero, was not afraid of the bright lights, as the sophomore delivered nine digs in a winning effort.
“It was a lot of fun getting to start Friday night, and I’m happy that I’m now able to contribute in matches,” Knapp said. “But what makes our team good is that we have 20 players that compete like hell everyday in practice to push the starters to play better.”
But in a match that can best be described as the ultimate team victory, USC coach Bill Ferguson and the Trojans still have their work cut out for them going forward. Although the team capitalized on Gaucho errors in the first (30-27) and third (30-24) sets, the Trojans were not highly efficient at the offensive end, hitting .209 on the night with no aces.
“Errors and lack of focus have certainly been a concern, but, while many teams seem to be peaking this early in the season, we still have a long way to go until we reach our full potential,” Current said.
While the team flourished in the fifth set (15-10) after taking an early 7-3 lead, playing three straight grueling five-set matches tends to take a toll on players through the grind of a long season. USC, however, contends that its training has fully prepared it for the longevity of a full season.
“Despite having a few five game matches that would seemingly take a  toll on our physical health, our training has prepared us for those kind of games,” Current said.
If the fatigue of a demanding start to the season begins to wear on the team, the road-weary Trojans will at least have this to look forward to: seven straight home matches. While the Galen Center may seem more foreign at this point than the long, monotonous bus trips the team has become accustomed to this season, a little home cooking shouldn’t harm a team looking to make its mark in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The Trojans did not drop a single set in two home matches this season and look to continue this trend and their “one match at a time” philosophy when they take on the No. 10 Pepperdine Waves at 7 p.m. on Friday night. The Waves, who beat the Trojans on Jan. 29, are coming off their biggest victory of the season — an upset of the No. 1 California State University Northridge Matadors.
“We are all looking forward to coming back to the Galen Center and playing in front of our fans,” Bourne said. “After being under the pressure of playing in front of the other team’s fans for most of the season, we’re ready to pay them back and show them what we got at home.”

Playing in windy conditions on the big island of Hawaii, the No. 16 USC men’s golf team struggled to a ninth place finish Friday at the Mauna Lani Invitational.

The Trojans got off to a quick start Wednesday, finishing the first day of the tournament in fourth place. After another bright beginning on Thursday, including a first hole eagle by sophomore Steve Lim, USC was unable to grind out pars in the wind and limped to the finish.
“It was blowing anywhere from 15 to 25 miles an hour the whole time, nonstop,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “But in the middle of the second round, we were tied for second and then we really struggled on our second nine and we had to count an 81.”
The Trojans’ 13-over-par second round dropped them into eighth place and out of contention for the tournament title. USC finished the week at 22 over par, 20 strokes behind champions Stanford.
“We were overall really disappointed,” freshman Martin Trainer said. “We feel like we’re one of the top teams out there even though we haven’t proven it yet.”
The highlight of the tournament for the Trojans was Trainer’s final round 67 that propelled him into a tie for 21st for the week. The freshman’s final round of six birdies and one bogey made him the highest USC finisher at the tournament.
“I was really putting myself in the prime place to have an opportunity to make birdies,” Trainer said about his final round. “The first round and the second round I put myself in awkward spots where I was struggling to make pars.”
“What Martin did was really awesome,” Zambri added. “It’s great to see someone that young, not only shooting five under but finishing strong on a round of golf. I think he’s gonna be really good for us.”
Trainer shot 79-74 the first two days and finished at four over par on the week.
Junior Matthew Giles, a returning first team All-American, has struggled to replicate last season’s form this year and finished at five over par, shooting 72-74-75 and tying for 29th place.
“I know I can play a lot better than that,” Giles said. “I think everything was just a little bit scrappy. But I think I’m relatively close to getting my game back to where it needs to be.”
Sophomore Steve Lim, the only other returning member from last year’s NCAA quarterfinal team, shot 73-72-76 and also finished at five over par.
“I know that Matthew and Steve will come around,” Zambri said. “I just know that we’re not satisfied with ninth and, if I ever am, I should be shown the door.”
Freshman Sam Smith shot           74-81-74 to finish in a tie for 63rd at 13 over par for the week while redshirt junior Bo DeHuff shot 74-81-81 to finish at 20 over par and a tie for 93rd.
Stewart Hagestad, a freshman competing as an individual for USC, posted a five-over-par week, shooting 79-72-70.
The Trojans ninth place finish looks better when considering 11 of the nation’s top 20 teams were in the 22 team field at Mauna Lani, but Zambri is convinced his team can do better.
“It was a really good field, and it was good for us to start the spring against competition like that,” Zambri said. “But I don’t feel like lowering my expectations to accept ninth place. I know we’re better than that and eventually you just have to step up and start playing well.”
The Trojans will tee it up next on March 1, when they host the USC Intercollegiate at North Ranch Country Club in Westlake Village, Calif.

Someone asked Nikola Vucevic after USC’s 66-63 win over California on Thursday if he enjoyed being put on the spot near the end of the game, when he knocked down four free throws in a span of 10 seconds to secure a crucial victory for the Trojans.
The sophomore didn’t hesitate. 
“When I made them, I was really happy because it gave us the win,” Vucevic said. “I always wanted to be a clutch player some time.”
Leave it to the 6-foot-10, 240-pound forward to be candid.
His coach, first-year USC head man Kevin O’Neill, has been more than candid in detailing Vucevic’s successes and struggles this season.
Since December, O’Neill has pushed Vucevic, telling him — and maybe yelling at him — that he wasn’t giving his all in every game.
O’Neill has repeated the same line many, many times in a variety of ways.
Here’s one version of that chorus I wrote down after USC lost to Stanford in the Bay Area last month.
“When he learns to play hard, he’s going to surprise even himself with his performances.”
Now, he might be surprising himself, but he’s certainly not surprising his teammates.
Not after an 18-point, 14-rebound performance in Saturday’s 54-49 win over Stanford that almost single-handedly powered the Trojans to victory.
Not after tipping in perhaps the most important shot of the game with 26 seconds left, going up strong after the ball had almost refused to go in on prior USC attempts.
Not after demanding the ball and overpowering Stanford’s forwards in the post all night long.
“I feel like he’s kind of a consistent double-double for us,” senior point guard Mike Gerrity said Saturday. “He’s just all over the boards, he’s got those long arms, really doing a great job inside stretching out the offenses. He’s really been a huge addition to our team this season.”
See what I mean?
And O’Neill’s refrain — play hard and everything will work out better — is finally making inroads to Vucevic’s psyche as well.
“I think I made it easier for myself tonight because I played harder,” Vucevic said Saturday. “Coach gets on me all the time that I don’t play hard enough, but I think I did a good job in playing hard today. When you play hard it’s a lot easier to do everything.”
And his coach believes in him too — even if still thinks he’s a little green.
After all, Vucevic is just 19 years old. And this is just his third season of organized basketball in the United States.
“By the time Nik’s ready to go next year after a summer of work, he’s going to be so good,” O’Neill said after USC’s win on Saturday on the strength of Vucevic’s standout performance. “To have 18 and 14 tonight, that’s just big-time playing for a guy who hasn’t really played much.”
And, boy, did he come up big on that last-minute tip-in. With USC down 49-48, three Trojans attempted to put in a lay-up that would give them the lead.
But no one could do it, until Vucevic tipped it in with two hands.
Two hands because the last time he tried to tip a shot in — last month, against Stanford — he used only one hand, and it didn’t quite work.
This time, he listened to his coach.
Vucevic called it “a big relief.”
Senior forward Marcus Johnson said the time the ball lingered on or around the rim felt like “a lifetime,” especially with the last Stanford debacle flashing through everybody’s minds.
“I’m sitting there waiting for it to come down because I didn’t want to touch it while it was on the rim. It fell in, so I’m happy about it,” Johnson said. “He didn’t capitalize up there so he made sure he did tonight.”
Ask Vucevic to explain the situation in retrospect, and he says it’s just a learning experience.
“Over there I went with one hand and I missed,” Vucevic said. “So here I had to go with two and I made it.”
And I’m sure O’Neill is undoubtedly glad to hear of his growth and development because they both know there’s a lot more that can be grown out of the classic partnership of player and coach — or Nik and K.O. as they call each other.

The USC men’s basketball team seems to feel right at home at the Galen Center.
Floor general · Senior point guard Mike Gerrity played all 40 minutes of Saturday’s game against the Stanford Cardinal, contributing 11 points, two assists and a key block of a 3-point attempt late in the game. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (14-9, 6-5) used some late-game heroics in front of an energized home crowd to hold off Stanford (10-13, 4-7) on Saturday, withstanding several rallies from the Cardinal en route to a 54-49 victory. The win avenges USC’s one-point loss to Stanford earlier in the season and moves USC into a five-way tie for second place in the Pac-10.
Sophomore center Nikola Vucevic carried much of the Trojans’ offensive load, scoring 18 points and grabbing 14 rebounds, including a late tip-in that gave USC the lead for good. Redshirt senior guard Mike Gerrity added 11 points and sophomore forward Leonard Washington contributed nine points off the bench.
But it was defense that ultimately gave the Trojans the advantage.
“I couldn’t be more proud of our guys,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “We really did a great job of executing defensively down the stretch. For us to hold them to 49 [points] and 30 [percent shooting] is really a heck of a job.”
With the exception of Stanford guard Landry Fields — who had 27 points on 10-for-19 shooting — USC was able to largely snuff out the Cardinal attack, limiting all other players to six points or less. This was the seventh game this season that the Trojans — whose defense currently ranks second in the nation in points per game allowed — held their opponent to under 50 points.
USC once again jumped to an early lead in the first half, going on a 9-2 run to start the game. But after trailing by as many as 14, the Cardinal stormed back by scoring 14 consecutive points, at one point leading 23-22. The game remained knotted for the rest of the first half, as USC was only able to take a one-point advantage into the break.
In the second half, USC found its rhythm offensively, pulling out to an eight-point lead capped by a Washington dunk with 14 minutes left to play. But a 12-0 Stanford run, of which Fields scored nine, put the Cardinal back on top late in the game. USC responded with an 8-2 run of its own, but it was not until Vucevic — who couldn’t capitalize on a scoring chance at the end of the game in USC’s loss at Stanford earlier in the season — managed to convert a tip-in with 26 seconds left that was able to secure the victory.
“[O’Neill] always gets on me about [the loss at Stanford], and he always tells me not to use one hand,” Vucevic said of his late-game score. “So this game, he told me to just crash the boards and use two hands and it worked out.”
The Trojans remain one game out of first place, but they were able to jump into a tie for second because of Arizona and Arizona State losses. The loss moves Stanford into last place in the conference.
“It says a lot about our guys, when you go down four like that, to just hang in,” O’Neill said. “We hung in there long enough to get the win and that’s all that really counts. For us, this ended up being a heck of a night.”

The day has finally arrived when I can legally buy alcohol. No, I didn’t have a birthday, and I’m still only 20 — I’m in Europe.
The United States is just one of a handful of countries that bans people from drinking before the age of 21, a move that eliminates not only alcohol consumption but also the majority of nightlife opportunities for those who are underage. 
For two decades, I’ve lived under these rules, but Britons two years my junior — like most European teens — have been able to drink beer with their burgers and toast to the new year with champagne since high school graduation.
Forget about taking AlcoholEdu or DPS breaking up parties before 1 a.m. In England, the outlook toward college-aged drinkers is so positive that universities openly condone school-sponsored events that provide alcohol to students.
Even before classes started last month, I was encouraged to attend a wine and cheese event held by City University administration, which took place at Ten Squared, their version of USC’s Traditions. Under the guise of student bonding, the gathering supplied a steady stream of complimentary wine even when the crackers ran out.
During the first days of the new term, also known as Refreshers Week, I was courted by Student Union representatives and bombarded with flyers to attend welcome back activities, such as student club nights and a pirate boat party on the Thames River, all of which advertised the sale of alcoholic beverages.
But if school officials seem unperturbed by student drinking, it is only because they are taking cues from the government. Under British law, young adults between the ages of 16 and 17 can drink wine, beer or cider as long as they are eating a meal and accompanied by an adult.
As a result of these lower age limitations, the doors to many nighttime activities are open to college students.
As in the United States, Thursdays are a popular night for the college crowd to go out on the town, but you can find student specials for clubs, pubs and bars on almost any weekday. The key, however, is to do a little research on closing times, or you might find yourself kicked to the curb before the clock strikes midnight.
Because London nightlife is expensive — entrance into a popular club can be as much as £27 (about $43) — many students still opt to drink beforehand at home with a couple of friends before going out.
The English pub is at the heart of British drinking culture. Britons spend £17 billion ($27 billion) in pubs each year, which is about £10  billion ($15.5 billion) more than they spend on going to the movies, theater and museums combined.
Most people usually stop by these establishments for light meals and cheap drinks before continuing their night’s  journey. In recent years, however, pubs have brought in live D.J.s to attract a broader clientele, transforming many into final destinations. Luckily, the multitude of pubs and their proximity to local transportation makes it easy to get around without having to worry about parking fees or DUIs.
The bravest of bar hoppers attempt the pub crawl, a local drinking game where players get off at each stop, head to the closest bar for a drink and then hop back on the tube for the next stop.
With most subways stretching across the city — the main Circle Line in central London has 27 stations — pub crawls can get ugly. But because drinks in London are made with shots about half the size of American shots, finishing the formidable quest is a little bit easier.
Unlike Los Angeles, many London clubs keep their doors open seven nights a week, with some even doubling as restaurants during the day.
Tiger Tiger, a club notorious for its Monday student nights, boasts a full menu, including sizzling sirloin steak and Tiger Prawn Skewers.
Dress codes vary but are usually more on the casual side. Some clubs even ban formal attire altogether in favor of jeans and tennis shoes.
Music staples typically include an eclectic mix of hip-hop, house, techno and ’90s music, but you can find places playing anything from indie pop to Bhangra.
Like everything else though, all good things must come to an end. So when it’s finally time to stumble on home, apologize to the cab driver and tell him you’re a little bit pissed.
If he’s a true Brit, he’ll understand.

There are two sides to the foodie debate, represented by the opposing factions of sweet and savory. While the sweet camp happily dives right into a carton of ice cream for dinner, for instance, the savory camp will be just as happy munching cheese and crackers for dessert. But at Syrup Desserts these camps are reconciled: Both ice cream and cheese are presented in one single dish to satisfy guests’ preferences, whether for sweet or savory tastes.
Holy crêpe · In addition to customizable waffle combinations, Syrup Desserts serves themed crêpes that come with ice cream and sweet cheese. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Despite its name, Syrup Desserts isn’t exclusively a dessert place. A coffee shop, cafe and ice cream parlor all in one, Syrup Desserts is one of the few dessert bars available in Downtown Los Angeles for after-dinner hangouts. Opened last August by owners Stan Lin and Steven Seav (Lin is a USC alumnus), it has joined other late-night stores like L.A. Café and D-Town Burger Bar in contributing to the growing nightlife along the historic core of Los Angeles.
Syrup Desserts is built with the neighborhood community in mind. The setup is sophisticated and urban, with a lofted second floor, dim lights and sleek counters, but with none of the pretension of a VIP lounge. Instead, the place exudes a warm feeling that all but beckons passersby, the feeling of invitation enhanced by welcoming furniture like lounge seating and couches; Syrup Desserts charms customers with decorative touches like brick and tiled walls, sugar and tea canisters and giant Nutella jars. In fact, they even offer free wireless Internet so customers can update their Facebook status over a pastry or cup of coffee. For groups that crave a more social spot, they also stock board games like Sorry, Connect 4, Clue and Monopoly upstairs.
The service is equally amicable, accommodating and patient with even the most nitpicking of customers. When one customer asked for the Fresh Fruit Blintz, but without the ice cream, cheese, compote, coulis or whipped cream — essentially making up her own crêpe — the server’s friendly smile never flickered.
Unfortunately, the management of the store was sorely lacking — literally. When the same customer tried to substitute frozen yogurt for the ice cream in her crêpe, she was informed that the restaurant was out of frozen yogurt, despite being one of the posted menu choices.
After ordering the Asian Pear and Gouda grilled cheese sandwich, for instance, the server asked if they could substitute in Cuban bread as they were out of walnut raisin bread — the sandwich’s real selling-point.
All the same, the sandwich was presented perfectly buttered and toasted on a spotless plate, accompanied with a medley of colorful fruits.
The crêpe came artistically presented as well, neatly stuffed and folded with fresh fruits sprinkled around and a dash of powdered sugar topping. The blackberry jasmine ice cream came on the side in a frosted cup with two tiny spoons.
The sweet grilled cheese sandwich was stuffed with juicy, sweet Asian pear perfectly balanced with the sharp, nutty taste of melted Gouda cheese, a delicious combination of sweet and savory. But the Cuban bread was nothing special, just your basic white crusty bread. Regrettably, this sandwich would have been much better with the original walnut raisin bread; the crunch from the nuts and the chewiness of the raisins would have added more depth and texture. On a brighter note, the fruits that accompanied it were fresh-cut on the spot, not canned and syrupy.
The other customer’s crêpe was heavily customized of course, but even with just fruits and a thin pancake it made for a light, pleasant dessert. The blackberry jasmine ice cream was a revelation — infused with the fruity fragrance and taste of real blackberries, there was also an intriguing jasmine tea undertone. Altogether, it was refreshing yet creamy, light yet exotically rich.
Syrup Desserts also sells other desserts in similar combinations but with a different base. Its waffles — Belgian, liege or deluxe fancy — are immensely popular, with fun creations like the Tropical Coconut (a coconut waffle, topped with lychee ice cream, sliced pineapples, coconut flakes and pineapple sauce). Or you might crave a more classic combination, like the Syrup Signature, an original sweet liege waffle topped with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, strawberry glaze and chocolate syrup. If none of the management’s suggestions sound appealing, customers also have the option of creating their own waffle dessert by choosing your waffles, ice cream, fruit toppings and syrups.
All crêpes come with some kind of ice cream and sweet cheese, but with different fillings and toppings according to their various themes. For example, the Apple Pie By Grandma comes filled with grilled apples, dulce de leche ice cream and cheddar cheese, with ground cinnamon and caramel as toppings. The Crêpe Tiramisu is yet another play on a classic, filled with strawberries, tiramisu ice cream, espresso-dipped Italian lady fingers, chocolate and mascarpone cheese.
Even the drinks have a unique spin to them. Besides classic beverages like espressos and macchiatos, you can also diversify your options with Mint Mojito iced tea, Velvet Rooibos with mint and chocolate or Spicy Aztec hot chocolate, all of which will pair well with other pastry options like layered cakes, Napoleons and fruit tarts.
With such a wide variety of options, Syrup Desserts embraces customers of all types. Its relaxed atmosphere will draw in lone customers looking for a quiet spot to read, and its friendly vibe will encourage dressed-up socialites to kick off their spiky high heels and loosen their ties. It might even persuade staunch Savory-lovers to indulge in a little sweetness in their dishes and discover their hidden sweet tooth. All in all, Syrup Desserts is most definitely a sweet addition to the Downtown community.
Its really nice to see Trojan Alumni revisiting their roots and contributing to the neighborhood near campus, albeit not within walking distance. 
I have been to Syrup Desserts and there food really is a fresh twist and unique spin on favorites. I like the place because its an espresso joint along with a dessert bar but it doesn’t come with the high prices that you are accustomed to. I don’t know if this was the intention but I like the concept.
Art Walk is a good time to drop by but it gets busy quick. It amazes me to see how the Historic core has improved over the years. Spring street where Syrup Desserts is located used to be a desolate wasteland. 
This was a well written article and very informative.
Trojan loft,
Agree 100%. Especially about the prices. Belgian Waffles for $6? You can get a great breakfast/lunch/late dinner for under $10 any night which is better than most other dessert places I can think of.
Don’t neglect Syrup Desserts on weekend mornings for a terrific breakfast. The waffles truly are fantastic, and can be ordered with or without ice cream; also, don’t miss the mint hot chocolate!
I  most enjoy sitting outside at one of the two (or is it three?) small tables. And as for parking, there are metered spots along the street and a couple of low priced lots quite close by.
Support USC grads and enjoy!

Outside Doheny Memorial Library Saturday night, two of us took refuge beneath the building’s grand archway from the clamor of chatter, clinking cocktail glasses and jazz music resounding inside. The man in my company, average in height with hair prematurely silver, offered me a cigarette that I politely refused.
“I just needed a break from all that,” I told him.
Fade in · Sponsored by USC Libraries, the Scripter award is given out each year to the film adaptation that best represents the original work. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
“Oh, tell me about it,” he said. And then, as unassuming as though he were someone’s dinner guest for the evening, simply along for the ride, he continued: “I’m Walter Kirn.”
Kirn has written multiple novels, two of which — Thumbsucker and Up in the Air — have been turned into films. The former was a Sundance darling; the latter has been garnering critical acclaim left and right since its December 2009 release. He also contributes regularly to esteemed publications like the New York Times, New York Magazine and Time Magazine.
But outside with his Camel filters, he was a man who lives in Montana, met his current girlfriend on Facebook and saw very little in his English degree from Princeton University.
“I had to unlearn everything I learned at Princeton,” he told me. “You can still flunk out of school and be a writer.”
It was slightly ironic, questioning the merit of higher education while on the front steps of Doheny Library. But that’s a writer for you.
Now in its 22nd year, the annual USC Scripter Award not only acknowledges screenwriters, who notoriously remain at the base of Hollywood’s totem pole,  but also novelists who have produced works that have sparked interest and inspiration in filmmakers. Arguably the most low-profile film award given during award season, the Scripter is a rarity in an industry that now, more than ever, neglects the talent behind the written word.
“A lot of times, screenwriters are thought of as interchangeable. They probably get fired more than anybody else in the business,” said committee member Steven Zaillian, who penned the scripts Schindler’s List and Gangs of New York. “It’s unfortunate we’re thought of as the ones who can be fired.”
But even outside of Hollywood, the once-revered writer has become lost in an increasingly visually stimulated society.
“People forget that all films don’t spring fully formed as a film. There’s an origin — an adaptation,” added Catherine Quinlan, dean of the USC Libraries. “People forget that there’s a whole bunch of thought behind [a film], and our job is to remind them.”
This year, the Scripter Award selection committee witnessed a record number of eligible movies adapted from previously written work — 68 in total. The committee, which is composed of screenwriters, novelists and USC professors and chaired by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Naomi Foner, reads and views every qualifying piece of material by the end of the calendar year.
Then, in what Dean Quinlan calls a “pretty egalitarian” system, committee members rank their top five favorite adaptations. From there, the Dean calibrates the number of votes and narrows it down to five finalists.
Unlike the Academy Awards and other film ceremonies, the members focus on how well each screen adaptation captured the essence of the original work.
“The film has to have more than just a germ of the story — it has to have the same feeling. I want to feel as though I’m experiencing the same thing but in a completely different way,” Dean Quinlan explained. “That means the screenwriter must have understood the book in a significant enough way that I can still understand the story.”
Among the films and writers recognized Saturday evening were Crazy Heart, adapted by Scott Cooper from Thomas Cobb’s novel of the same title; District 9, based on the short script Alive in Joburg, both written by Neill Blomkamp; An Education, adapted by Nick Hornby from the memoir by Lynn Barber, which she extended from her article for the quarterly magazine Granta; Precious, which Geoffrey Fletcher based on the novel Push by Sapphire; and Up in the Air, adapted by Sheldon Turner and Jason Reitman from Kirn’s novel of the same name.
Three of the finalists — An Education, Precious and Up in the Air — are nominated for the Oscar for best adapted screenplay.
Fletcher, a Harvard and New York University graduate, was unaware of Push’s devoted following when he was approached by Precious director Lee Daniels to write the script. Although he “fell in love” with the main protagonist in the novel’s first few pages, Fletcher claims the distance from Push’s literary significance was ultimately beneficial.
“It would’ve possibly inhibited me from taking a lot of necessary leaps. I would hold it too sacred,” Fletcher said. “But to make Push into an accessible cinematic experience while still honoring the impact of the book — that was my goal. My hope is that the spirit of the book remains in the spirit of the script and the movie, even though all three are very distinct.”
Though each art form is distinct in medium, Forrest Gump screenwriter Eric Roth, who accepted the Scripter Literary Achievement Award that evening, reminded those in attendance that “film is a product of collaboration.”
“It’s such a continuing process of rewriting, writing, writing, rewriting,” said Roth later in an interview. “But I’d say that the visions of almost all of them have been fairly true to what we conceived of originally. That’s important, because [if] you start changing things dramatically, you’ll might end up with a whole different thing.”
An hour or so after our conversation, when Up in the Air was announced as the 2010 Scripter winner, Kirn was the focal point of the swanky gathering, flanked by Reitman and Turner and clutching the sparkling Scripter plaque by his side.
“You know, I’m a novelist—we don’t usually get awards,” Kirn said, continuing with more self-deprecating humor.
“When the dean mentioned that there were all these readers out there who have intimate relationships with the book … she was telling a little white lie,” he said. “In my case, there were readers of the book that had no knowledge of its existence and could care less how it was adapted or if it became a porn film.”
In a way, Kirn was just along for the ride, unaccustomed to award shows even as amicable as the Scripter. But it is perhaps the only accolade Kirn will receive for his contribution to the Up in the Air script, for awards like the Oscars, Golden Globes and even the Writers Guild of America solely recognize the screenwriter’s rehashing of a novelist or journalist’s vision.
Certainly, if it weren’t for Reitman’s perception and sizable bank account, Kirn and his novel would still be relatively unknown to mainstream audiences. Yet if it weren’t for Kirn, Reitman would have been without a story to tell and the year 2009 without one of its most honest, thought-provoking films.
Fletcher, just as gracious as Kirn for his recognition on his first produced feature, eloquently put it: “All of us have a wonderful story inside of us; it’s just communicating it in a way that reaches the audience in a compelling manner where your inspiration survives and perhaps activates their own.”

Light is responsible for your visual perception of everything: the blueness of the sky, the glistening morning dewdrops on spider webs and the readability of words. Without light, we would be blind to all beauty, to all ugliness. 
It seems obvious, yet we hardly ever take the time to look at light itself, look not at the things it’s illuminating but at it, to appreciate it and say “Wow, it’s amazing.”
Well, this is my ode to light. The more I learn about light, the more I am awed by it. It is the opposite of your average love affair. Light is so genuinely mysterious that even experts on light fail to understand it. As a romantic, I am relentlessly drawn in by its elusive nature.
Light elucidates and enlightens, and at the same time it can make one feel very much in the dark. We tend to think that we, as humans, are an advanced and superior species. And yet, after all these years of scientific inquiry and method, we can’t harness light for solar power with anywhere near the efficiency that primitive marine algae do for photosynthesis.
A study published in Nature last week revealed that light works with algae in a seemingly supernatural way. Once captured, energy from a photon explores all the possible pathways to the alga’s reaction center and chooses the shortest route — all without losing any energy.
This phenomenon, termed quantum coherence, means the energy from the light exists in multiple places at once. Literally.
Gregory Scholes, leader of the study, uses this analogy: “You have three ways of driving home through rush hour traffic. On any given day, you take only one. You don’t know if the other routes would be quicker or slower. But in quantum mechanics, you can take all three of these routes simultaneously. You don’t specify where you are until you arrive, so you always choose the quickest route.”
Light is unattainable, illogical and incomprehensible. Loving it is never dull. It has a tendency to misbehave — to do things for others that it will not do for us, and to be multiple, contradictory things at once — both a particle and a wave. It changes characteristics inexplicably in response to how you observe it and escapes into dimensions that are inaccessible to us.
Moreover, light is forever young. Every single photon that exists today is the exact same age it was at the moment of the Big Bang. Light hasn’t even aged a millisecond because nothing travels through spacetime faster than light. It is stuck in a perpetual present. Think of ascending a descending escalator at a pace that keeps you in a stationary location: Spacetime moves, but light moves just as fast in a metaphorically opposite direction — it is frozen because of its boundless permeation.
And yet, in spite of all these qualities that should make us jealous of light, it is impossible to cease admiring it.
Light can sometimes make us feel small and insignificant, as it enables the perception of all the distant stars in the sky. But at other times it makes us feel so enormous and important that we forgive its faults, and we realize our mutual dependence.
When light enters our eyes and interacts with the neurons in our occipital lobe, the vision center of our brain, something incredible happens — something arguably more incredible than quantum coherence — every imaginable color is captured, from dazzling gold to crystalline blue.
Without the interaction between light waves and our visual system, the world would be as colorless as a mathematical equation. This knowledge leads us to the realization that we, as humans capable of perception and appreciation, are really quite amazing too.
An analogy written by James W. Kalat in his neuroscience textbook, Biological Psychology, helped me see the light: If you were a piece of iron, how would you perceive a drop of water? You would have the experience of rust. From the perspective of iron, water is primarily “rustish.” But as a human, you know that rustishness is not a property of water at all. It occurs in iron when water interacts with it.
Similarly, color is a product of the reaction between light waves and our brain cells. Without this union, color would not exist — neither would beauty nor any other visual quality, except perhaps as dry potential.
The universe seems to have brought light into existence and orchestrated an evolution that allowed for something as complex and perfect as the mirror that is the eyeball — all so that it could look at itself.
You and light are better off together. The world, without your union, would not be beautiful.

Attention: doppelgänger week is over.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
So here’s to the end of seeing a greasy, rippling Zac Efron, three ecstatic, giggling Anne Hathaways, and a dunk-faced Trevor Ariza cluttering your Facebook news feed.
For those that have lived underneath a technologically primitive rock for the past fortnight, doppelgänger week is a hot Internet movement encouraging others to post a celebrity look-alike as their profile picture.
“Oh my god! One time, when I was drunk outside a club, someone TOTALLY told me I looked like Rachel McAdams!”
Key word: drunk.
One can only wonder how such a movement started: a caffeine-deprived intern at Google images plotting a boost in site hits hoping that his revolutionary new-media idea gets him a permanent job. Perhaps it was a socially awkward Germanophile scheming in a sticky basement to make “doppelgänger” a buzz word on the interwebs.
Isn’t seeing your doppelgänger a bad thing?
According to Wikipedia and superstitious grandmothers everywhere, seeing one’s look-a-like is a harbinger of death.
The most unnerving part of this whole trend, however, is its promotion of self-delusion. People already labor over which pictures to set as their profile default; after all, it’s this one image that completely and totally defines the Facebook user, social status and personal mission in life. Facebook standards include the daredevil-skydiving shot, the studying-abroad-in-Europe snapshot, the here’s-me-playing-my-sport, dancing on stage, singing in a musical and the time-treasured drinking-out–of-red-cups picture. They are perfect, pretentious moments of the image each individual wants to project.
Crafting a perfectly calculated image of oneself shouldn’t involve strangers. There’s already a sense of fakery around your present profile pictures: No one posts profile pictures of herself without makeup, or showing their gut.
You, in your profile picture, don’t look like you do in class with unwashed hair and sweatpants.
You probably look more like a Hapsburg than Pierce Brosnan.
The veneration of celebrity — no matter how dumb or evil the persona — has infected us so deeply as a society that we are willing to embrace a famous person’s face and personality as our own. It just seems like the modern equivalent of eating the corpses of our enemies to absorb their characteristics.
Will this phenomenon happen again? There’s no way of telling in the wake of the trend. It’s safe to say that the week has nothing on other week-long events, like Discovery Channel’s Shark Week. Although, if someone threw in some shark cage, chum-covered  elements to their copyright-violating pictures, it would make things far more interesting.
Say goodbye, folks: Part ways with that glittering, smiling shot and prepare yourselves for, well, yourself. One can’t live every week like it’s doppelgänger week.
One can only hope that its mass trend of claiming another’s face as your own won’t inspire hundreds of major and minor celebrities to sue hapless Facebook users everywhere. Poor celebrities: Everyone wants their bodies. Literally.
A pouty Jessica Alba simply can’t testify at 800 different civil cases to reclaim her identity.
Well, she could hire some look-alikes to do it for her.
