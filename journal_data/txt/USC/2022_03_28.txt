If you have followed any sport for the past decade or so, you have probably heard an ignorant fan or political commentator echo some version of the refrain: “Keep politics out of sports, they shouldn’t mix.” 
While certain spectators might prefer their sports depoliticized, such fans do not seem to realize that their campaign against the mixture of sports and politics will never be successful; sports and politics blend constantly and always have. As long as athletes keep making political statements in interviews, candidate donors own sports teams and wars affect international athletic competitions, politics and sports will continue to intertwine.
As such, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has had major ramifications for sports, particularly European soccer. At the outbreak of the invasion, the Russian men’s national team was in the midst of a qualifying campaign for the 2022 World Cup, Russian club Spartak Moscow were competing in the Europa League and Russian oligarchs owned club teams across the continent, including Chelsea FC. 
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the soccer world reacted in a manner intended to punish Russia and Russian sporting interests. 
First and foremost, the members of the Polish national team, due to play against Russia in a World Cup qualifying play-off March 24, decided to not take the field, a decision the Polish soccer federation’s president supported. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny posted a particularly emotional message on Instagram, decrying the conflict and excusing himself from participation, which kickstarted the Polish reaction against Russia.
UEFA then expelled Spartak Moscow, the only Russian club left in European competition, from the Europa League, further diminishing Putin’s ability to co-opt Russian sporting success for patriotic purposes as his country imposes their military strength on its neighbor. 
These actions align with non-soccer sports authorities, as the International Ice Hockey Federation, World Curling and World Rugby also banned Russia and Belarus — Russia’s military ally in its invasion against Ukraine — from competition.
The consequence of Russia’s invasion that has attracted the most media attention, however, are the affairs of Chelsea FC and the sanctions the United Kingdom has imposed on the club’s owner, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. 
Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, and, with his substantial financial support, the club has won 18 major trophies since Abramovich’s takeover. In accordance with the sanctions, the British government has seized Abramovich’s UK-based assets, including, of course, Chelsea FC, one of the country’s most popular clubs. Even before the government took control of Chelsea, Abramovich had decided to sell it after coming under public pressure as the invasion broke out. But the sanctions have certainly accelerated Abramovich’s desire to sell the club and escape pressure from the British government. 
Assuming Abramovich manages to sell Chelsea for his reported asking price — around 3 billion pounds — it would be the most expensive purchase of a soccer club in history, more than doubling the 560-odd million euros the Glazers paid for Manchester United in the mid-2000s. 
Whoever purchases Chelsea will have a major impact on the future of European and British soccer, considering Chelsea has a huge global following that has developed an expectation of competing for multiple trophies each season. 
In his almost 20 years as Chelsea owner, Abramovich has injected 1.5 billion pounds of his personal wealth into the club, who have been notorious big-spenders in the transfer market, most recently acquiring German starlet Kai Havertz and the Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku for huge fees in consecutive summers. Chelsea fans have come to expect a certain level of investment and could quickly turn on a new ownership group if they decide to be more frugal. 
New owners would also likely need to invest 1 billion pounds or more into stadium redevelopment. Chelsea’s current ground, Stamford Bridge, is one of the older and smaller stadiums among Europe and England’s biggest clubs. 
Tottenham for instance, can hold 62,303 viewers in their newly built stadium, while the Bridge’s maximum occupancy is just over 40,000. A new stadium with a higher capacity would help secure the club’s financial future, allowing it to generate substantially more matchday revenue to offset high wages and transfer fees.
All in all, Chelsea has many desirable traits to offer its suitors. With one of the most popular clubs in the world’s game, Chelsea’s new owners would join an exclusive cabal of the most powerful and envied owners across sports. 
The possibility of backing a winning club and earning personal sporting glory, as well as being one of the people in the room for major Premier League decisions, is enticing to the billionaires of the world, as it was for Abramovich 20 years ago. 
The Raine Group, the bank Abramovich appointed to conduct the club’s sale on his behalf, announced a shortlist this past Friday with the four finalists who will be permitted to further analyze Chelsea’s financial information. 
Among them are the Ricketts family, owners of the Chicago Cubs, Josh Harris and David Blitzer, owners of the Philadelphia 76ers and other teams, Stephen Pagliuca, owner of the Boston Celtics, and the group led by Todd Boehly, a minority owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The Ricketts family has attracted a particular attention and, at times, ire from Chelsea fans, who have taken issue with patriarch Joe Ricketts for his offensive and inaccurate comments about Muslim people. While Ricketts senior is not involved in the bid for Chelsea, #NoToRicketts has trended on Twitter among Chelsea fans. 
Whatever the result, an American-led consortium will own Chelsea.
All this being said, one must note that the ongoing change in Chelsea’s ownership pales in comparison to the grave importance of the invasion of Ukraine and the suffering of its people. While major political events have interesting consequences in sports worth analysis, the health and wellbeing of real people matters infinitely more. 
Hopefully this conflict reaches a peaceful conclusion with minimal casualties on both sides, especially for the civilians of Ukraine.

It was a somber Saturday Zoom press conference for Head Coach Lincoln Riley who remembered Dave Nichol, USC’s Assistant Coach who passed away Friday. He was 45. 
Riley said everyone on staff was “in a little bit of a fog, like a haze,” Friday, but that playing back on the field Saturday was a form of everyone getting away. 
Nichol’s health deteriorated in the last couple of weeks. Riley announced last Monday that Nichol would take time away from the team to attend to a private health manner. 
Nichol joined USC this season, after spending the previous two seasons at Mississippi State as an inside receivers coach. Prior to that, he worked as inside receivers coach in the Pac-12 at Washington State for three seasons. Nichol also spent some time at Eastern Carolina and Arizona after starting at Texas Tech in 2000. 
It was reported that Nichol was battling cancer.
Riley credited Nichol with opening the door for him to become a coach, especially since Riley said he had no other connections into the business. Riley described Nichol as someone who just “really loves ball.” 
He first met Nichol as a walk-on at Texas Tech in 2002 where Nichol served as a graduate assistant. It was that moment that changed the tide for Riley’s future career. 
“There’s a strong possibility I wouldn’t be in college coaching without him … he was really the one who kind of gave me my first shot to walk on at Texas Tech,” Riley said. “He was kind of the guy that guided me, led me, taught me how to become a coach.” 
Riley said he “bugged” Nichol in those early years to learn as much as possible about the offense, and Nichol gave him all he wanted. 
When Riley would call, instead of talking about Nichol’s health, the associate head coach  insisted that Riley tell him about the team’s workouts and how the transition was going. 
“I’d go home at night [during the] last couple of weeks when he wasn’t feeling too good and he didn’t want to talk about none of that,” Riley said. “All he wanted to talk about was how the guys are doing, how’s install going … That just kind of shows you who he was.”  
When Riley made the move to USC, he said it was an immediate decision to bring Nichol on staff. The two had complemented each other, Riley said.  
“He’s just one of those guys in the business that knew our stuff inside and out,” Riley said. “You could trust him so much as a coach. He was always going to get his job done. He was always going to put the team first … he was just the epitome of a great coach and a great person.”

Thursday marked exactly four weeks since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. In that time, continued attacks on civilian targets expanded westward, where, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at time of publication, upward of 3.8 million people have fled to neighboring countries. On March 23, the U.N. counted 2,571 civilian casualties.
The Daily Trojan spoke with USC experts concerning the invasion’s impacts on the nuclear world order, record-high gas prices in the United States and the ensuing refugee crisis.
Najmedin Meshkati, professor of civil and environmental engineering, industrial systems engineering and international relations at the Viterbi School of Engineering, expressed concerns about Russia’s desire to “take over control of [the] four nuclear plants” operating in Ukraine.
“These plants … generate 50% of the electricity of that country,” Meshkati said. “Russia wants to be in control on that — then they want to shut it off, to pull the plug and stop the plants from operating.”
At time of publication, Russian forces control two of the four Ukrainian plants: Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia. Russian forces held more than 300 Ukrainians, including workers and guards hostage at Chernobyl, forcing them to continue operations at gunpoint for three weeks without rest. Russia allowed 64 people to leave Sunday and replaced them with “employee-volunteers.”
“Having worked on nuclear safety for the last 35 years, this is a recipe for disaster,” Meshkati said. “If there is, God forbid, an accident in these four plants … that radiation fallout will affect everybody.”
To avoid such a scenario, Meshkati said “the only solution” is to have demilitarized “safe-haven” zones around all Ukrainian plants.
“[The International Atomic Energy Agency] should mobilize on asking Russia to declare a ‘no-fighting’ zone around these plants and allow these employees and operators of the plants to rotate their shifts, be with their family,” he said. “Let Russians, unfortunately, do anything else that they want — but these four [plants] need to be considered as safe havens.”
Meshkati questioned the validity of past disarmament and security assurance agreements, including the 1994 Budapest Memorandum — which denuclearized Ukraine in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., United Kingdom and Russian Federation — as well as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which Meshkati extensively studied.  On March 4, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed regret about Ukraine’s denuclearization, saying “All that the [NATO] alliance has managed to do so far is carry 50 tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine … Probably so that we can burn the [Budapest Memorandum].”
Meshkati co-authored an article for Iran News in 2000, the title of which declared “The NPT is a Cold War Relic.” Over twenty years later, Meshkati said he is “even more convinced” that the title is applicable today.
“I think the NPT was good. It served its purpose, but we really need a paradigm shift,” he said. “After this [invasion], would Mr. Kim [Jong-un] in [North] Korea, or anybody for that matter, … exchange their nuclear weapon arsenal for a piece of paper? I mean, this is going to be the $65,000 question.”
“Having worked on nuclear safety for the last 35 years, this is a recipe for disaster. If there is, God forbid, an accident in these four plants … that radiation fallout will affect everybody.”
Shon Hiatt, associate professor of business administration at the Marshall School of Business and faculty affiliate of the Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, said the recent unprecedented hike in gasoline prices was the culmination of “an imbalance of supply and demand” that started about 10 months ago.
More recently, however, Hiatt said the “potential of Russian oil not getting onto the marketplace,” as Western trade deals with Russia deteriorated in the wake of the invasion, caused the “major price jump” to a national average of $4.17 per gallon on March 8 — the highest since 2008. Los Angeles County reached a record high of $5.966 per gallon on March 19.
The price hikes, in turn, increased political pressures in the U.S. to suspend gas taxes. Preexisting calls for a “gas tax holiday” gained further traction in Congress because of the Ukraine invasion. House Democrats introduced a bill on March 17 to provide rebate checks of $100 per month to American taxpayers. Hiatt said, at the federal level, such measures would only “add fuel to the inflationary fire.” A “complete 180-degree turn for the Biden administration” would be necessary instead, he said.
“They have this climate change strategy throughout all their agencies to reduce fossil fuel usage,” Hiatt said. “But, now that we have a massive shortage in the global supply, which is also building now into this inflation that we have — this is a terrible time to do this. So there needs to be a complete change, but that doesn’t seem to be happening.”
In a Feb. 28 Q&A with Marshall’s Communications team, Hiatt said he believed “the Glasgow 2021 goals to become carbon net neutral by 2050 will not be achieved.” When asked whether he had changed his mind since then, he said, “absolutely not.”
First, Hiatt said, recent decreases in the European Union’s carbon emissions, which were touted as progress toward the Glasgow goals, “never counted the Russian imports” — which account for 40% of E.U. consumption. As for China, the country processes 80% of the materials required to produce electric vehicle batteries, preventing U.S. energy independence.
“If you were to still continue for the Glasgow [goals], you’re still at the mercy of Russia and China — [countries] which, right now, don’t care much about Western interests,” Hiatt said.
Hannah Garry, clinical professor of law and founding director of the International Human Rights Clinic at the Gould School of Law, said the E.U. directive to grant Ukrainian refugees temporary protective status — allowing Ukrainians to live and work within the E.U. for three years — “makes a lot of good sense.” Under this Temporary Protection Directive, Ukrainians are also allowed freedom of movement, a reversal of the E.U.’s previous ‘first country of asylum’ policy, which states a refugee must remain in the first country to have granted them asylum. 
Garry also called the directive “discriminatory” because the E.U. denied freedom of movement for the millions of Afghan and Syrian refugees who have sought asylum in Europe. Refugees of color also faced racism at the Ukrainian border: Africans attempting to leave Ukraine told the New York Times that border guards would “slap them, beat them and push them to the end of the queue.”
“The perverse effect of the ‘first country of asylum’ rule is that these border countries are fatigued from taking in refugees or don’t want certain kinds of refugees,” Garry said. “So they have engaged in illegal deterrence practices, pushbacks, indefinite detention — and we are seeing that with Afghans and Syrians and others at the border … It’s clearly discrimination. And it’s clearly in violation of international law.”
Following the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis, public opinion of refugees in Europe was mostly negative: a 2016 Pew Research survey found that upward of 50% of surveyed Europeans believed refugees “are a burden to society,” that Syrian and Iraqi refugees were a major threat, and that an “influx of refugees will increase the likelihood of terrorism.” Meanwhile, far-right parties across Europe — including France’s National Rally (then the National Front) and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland — seized the opportunity to expand their power via anti-immigration platforms. But with Ukrainians, Garry said there was “more empathy and receptivity and openness.”
“We hear of individuals from those far-right parties … running to Ukraine to fight and to take part in the battle,” she said. “I think that they have seen these refugees coming out of Ukraine as in the battle for their national identity, for their self-determination as a state and as a country — and that resonates right with their narratives.”
Garry said she hopes the “Ukrainian model” of refugee policy “brings new awareness” to the European public and beyond.
“I’m hoping that, as we observe what’s going on in Europe — particularly as we’re having our own moments with systemic racism and understanding of underlying biases that are endemic in all systems — [we will] realize that it needs to change here in the United States as well,” Garry said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed regret about the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It has been updated to state that Zelensky expressed regret about the Budapest Memorandum. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

This review contains spoilers. 
There’s a powerfully thrilling quality to “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a film with so many seemingly separate things within itself that somehow manages to make meaning out of all of them. Directed by Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” reinforces the emotional qualities of an immigrant drama narrative with nuances to sci-fi and action genres. This combination might seem odd, but it ends up working out, benefiting the movie and its storyline. 
Michelle Yeoh stars as protagonist Evelyn Wang, a middle-aged Chinese woman struggling financially and emotionally. The film opens with Evelyn running a laundromat which the IRS is auditing. Evelyn’s daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is angry with her mother for never accepting her queerness and place in life. Then, just as Evelyn attempts to deal with her taxes, Evelyn’s husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) reveals he wants a divorce. All of this stress piles onto Evelyn, and eventually, she’s not only caught up in multiple issues but also multiple universes. 
The logistics of the whole  switching between many universes component are a bit confusing and complicated to understand. Audiences might end up just as bewildered as Evelyn when her “husband” from another universe appears in her current husband’s body before a tax audit. This rapid transformation involves Waymond suddenly assuming a confident and commanding demeanor, one much unlike the meek Waymond that Evelyn knows. Also, one thing to note: This Waymond apparently doesn’t need glasses.
During this abrupt transition in an elevator, this version of Waymond tells Evelyn that she must save the multiverse from an existential threat — an individual named Jobu Tupaki who wants to absorb the world into nothingness — by transporting herself to other universes. Within these universes are Evelyn’s alternate selves, each one of which possesses different skillsets (e.g. Kung Fu) that can help Evelyn defeat her enemies, minions of Jobu Tupaki.
Waymond informs Evelyn that individuals can “jump” to their other selves by establishing pathways, which are oddly specific actions such as eating a stick of ChapStick. Performing these actions can then stimulate the jump between universes. 
Although this idea might seem cliché, the film invites audiences to consider all the different lives we might have led had we taken a different path or made a different decision. As viewers follow Evelyn as she exists as diverse versions of herself, we’re shown the seemingly unlimited range of possibilities that could have determined Evelyn’s identity. Each one appears to have more potential for life than the present Evelyn. All of these sequences are delightfully bizarre and bizarrely delightful. 
In one, Evelyn is a celebrity actress. In another, she’s a martial artist — a skillset that comes in handy during the excellently choreographed action scenes. One of the most hilarious universes features Evelyn as a teppanyaki chef and Harry Shum Jr. as a fellow chef whose prolific cooking skills are controlled by a raccoon — an intelligently orchestrated nod to the animated film “Ratatouille.” 
Afterward it’s revealed that Jobu Tupaki is, in fact, a version of Evelyn’s daughter Joy. It’s implied that Joy’s villainous alter ego is brought about by her mother’s nonacceptance and the emotional and psychological turmoil that resulted from it. The notion of this, which caused her “fractured” mind in the multiverse, is an engaging metaphor that doesn’t try to tell the audience that it’s significant but, rather, attempts to show through the complicated mother-daughter relationship seen throughout all these different universes. 
Even as Evelyn and Joy change forms and fight epic battles that wouldn’t have been possible in the current universe, there’s always a deeply empathetic quality to their intergenerational interactions. Thus, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” really does make a statement on everything, even if it’s in a haphazard way. Yet, paradoxically, the film’s haphazardness is what makes the execution of the story genius. 
The film beautifully captures the generational trauma experienced by an immigrant family from China to the United States, used as a jumping off point to make a statement about Chinese diasporic identity: What it means to be a child of immigrants. Then, it illustrates, an incredibly imaginative sci-fi take on dreaming, beyond one’s own mediocrity. 
Given that Yeoh is one of the top actresses in Hollywood right now, it’s almost startling seeing her character labeled as a failure. Yet, despite the role’s many contradictions, Yeoh brings out the struggles of Evelyn’s inner self in a sensitive, three-dimensional way. 
Watching her, one doesn’t look at Evelyn and think, “Oh, it’s Michelle Yeoh.” Instead, we see a Chinese immigrant woman who’s trying to do her best: One who didn’t quite manage to achieve her dreams in life but has the potential to make the life she’s living a better one. 
“Everything Everywhere All at Once” is quirky and unexpected, a whole multiverse that reaches far into the depths of humanity to consider how we make meaning of ourselves. The process of traversing worlds also teaches us which ones we should value. After all, while there are so many universes in the world, it’s this one that we’re living in at the end of the day.

Adapted from Min Ju Lee’s 2017 New York Times bestselling novel of the same name, “Pachinko” tells a multi-generational story of a Korean woman and her family who moved to Japan during the Japanese colonization of Korea. Set against the backdrop of this harsh colonial regime, “Pachinko” tells a heart-wrenching and compelling story of love, family, hardship and discrimination throughout the 20th century.
With well-received, emotionally dense source material, the “Pachinko” TV adaptation, which premiered March 25 on Apple TV, certainly had large shoes to fill — and fill them they did.
The pilot switches between 1910s Korea, where the young protagonist Sunja (Minha Kim, Jeon Yu-na, and Youn Yuh-jung) grow up under the watch of her loving parents and less loving Japanese colonizers, and 1980s Japan, where Sunja’s grandson, uber ambitious New York banker Solomon (Jin Ha), returns to his childhood home of Japan (where Sunja now lives) to clinch a property development deal. 
While this is all the pilot holds, readers of the novel will know just how many storylines “Pachinko” will cover, as the book traces Sunja’s entire life and family throughout the 20th century. The pilot of “Pachinko,” especially with its long, highly stylized, “Succession” like, title sequence, establishes that “Pachinko” is not a typical K-drama — it’s a Korean American family epic that is only just getting started.
Ping-ponging between these two eras, “Pachinko” deftly represents and unpacks the traumatic history and structural racism foundational to the Korean-Japanese relationship. 
“Pachinko” does no favors to the Japanese in relation to the Korean experience — it represents Japanese forces in the 1910s as oppressive invaders, and in the 1980s, as a nation that still hasn’t much improved in their racial equality. “Pachinko” also doesn’t falsely represent Korea as a scarcely populated, impoverished country that might benefit from colonial occupation. Instead, it fully respects that state of prewar Korea, centering and uplifting the human stories of a nonindustrially developed nation in a respectful and noncondescending way — not often seen in major television. 
However, “Pachinko” cannot claim to be an entirely fresh, groundbreaking show. 
It still employs the standard drama tropes, such as the casual racism of the extreme American wealthy as a catalyst for the money and prestige-obsessed, male protagonist’s storyline, or the typical fairytale story of Sunja’s strict mother and overly doting father. However, it mixes these tropes with the more touching and new environment of an extremely  tumultuous period. 
Ultimately, while “Pachinko” doesn’t significantly stray from the world of melodramatic period pieces, its touching story proves that it doesn’t need to, that this genre is a perfectly suitable vessel for its message. 
“Pachinko” may tell a politicized story, but the incredibly personal and human way the story is told seems more inspired by a need for catharsis and representation than a political agenda. 
Beyond the emotional writing, “Pachinko” stands out with its beautiful look — vast landscapes and lush environments meld with a strong, purposeful color palette that provides a highly immersive experience for the viewer. 
Unlike common practice, the colors and designs for this show do not differ for different time periods — rather, each period retains the same style and cinematography, creating a cohesive effect further connecting the seemingly drastically different storylines even when they seem vastly different. For example, blue, foggy fishing docks in the 1920s translate easily to a smog-filled, light blue morning in 1989 Tokyo. 
“Pachinko” is touched with a layer of softness, even in night scenes. Despite the subtlety in brightness, the vibrancy and diversity of color smartly still prevent the lighting and design from becoming too nostalgic or dreamlike. Everything may appear to be gentle, but it’s certainly not quiet — it’s a color tone that fits the characters and the story’s themes.
The star-studded cast of “Pachinko” also blends so well into this world that it felt completely normal to see megastars such as Lee Min-ho (Boys over Flowers”) and Youn Yuh-jung (“Minari”), blend in with prewar Korean fishing markets and 1980s Japan. But most importantly, the casting of young Sunja — breakout star Jeon Yu-na  — may have been this show’s best decision. 
Jeon’s adorable physicality and incredibly emotional talent, such as her slow production of tears while watching Japanese soldiers beat a fisherman, make this suspenseful and depressing show only more heart-wrenching for viewers. Sunja’s ever-present naive and childlike innocence perfectly juxtaposes an ever-present, ominous tone that perpetually reminds viewers that no one gets by in this world unscathed.
“Pachinko” is a master class in downer television that still has a warm and positive heart — for “Pachinko,” that heart can be seen under layers of suspense and loss in its beautiful representation of Korea and Korean communities and its cathartic message of family and love. 
The twisting, suspenseful storylines and audience-focused acting denote this show as a K-drama at heart, but certainly not something that will fit easily in a box. Instead, most of the narratively complex and rich story has yet to unfold in what will surely become an unprecedented family epic for the ages.

The fashion industry has always had a fascination with the physical human figure. While the industry itself is about design, creation and homage, it has birthed the world of modeling and introduced an emotional relationship between clothing and people. 
Additionally, jewelers are even obsessed with body parts. Schiaparelli famously makes brooches, headpieces and bags detailed with ears, eyes and mouths, and designed Kim Kardashian’s green ab piece for Christmas in 2020. Likewise, EYEBA makes simple jewelry out of plastic eyes; their necklaces often have hands delicately holding pearls, crystals, or another hand; and there are rings that look as if the finger itself was cast in silver or gold as seen through face molding jeweler @fangophilia on Instagram. 
While the fetishization of feet has been a joke amongst me and my friends, it seems that many houses in the industry that I love and adore also have a love for feet — both human and animal.
One obvious example is the Margiela Tabis. Maison Margiela drew inspiration from the Japanese worker shoes and initially started his Tabi collection with just socks that featured a split-toe design.However, the publicly nicknamed “horse shoes” or “toe shoes” eventually became a staple in his Maison, launching Mary-Janes, flats, boots, loafers, sneakers and even mittens. While this design isn’t foreign to me — as I was born and raised in Tokyo — the public consensus is very evidently split between burning hate and intense love for the style. 
This uber distinct big toe separation resurfaced in Y/Project’s semi-recent SS19 collection, in which all but the big toe were left exposed, or the opposite. 
Another famous brand that played with the concept of feet in its footwear is Vivienne Westwood. While not as obvious as the Tabis, the heels have a subtle emphasis on the outline of four toes instead of five — more animal than human. The soft outlines from its FW09 collection were also seen again in their bondage-boot style with loud and visually heavy buckles and straps, ultimately softening the toes even more. But since the subtlety didn’t spark as much opinion as the Tabis, the style was ultimately discontinued and only remains in the singular collection that launched the design. 
A similar design to Vivienne Westwood is the new Balenciaga toe boots. Following suit in the subtle toe outline, the main difference is that Balenciaga included all five toes and appropriately named the shoe style “FETISH.” The silhouette is actually very similar to Celine’s recent SS13 heel under Phoebe Philo, if you are more familiar with that, but is all black instead of Celine’s painted toes. (Fun fact, Monaco’s Princess Caroline wore these Celine shoes).
Coming back to Schiaparelli, a Parisian fashion house, it has been following a similar design to the fingernail jewelry mentioned earlier, but this time, on toes. Its 2021 couture collection launched a series of different shoes — sandals, heels, wedges, boots — that cast each toe in gold. This didn’t explode in the fashion world. Since Schiaparelli is famous for its emphasis and recreation of feet and other body parts, Schiaparelli was just deemed another beautiful creation by Daniel Roseberry. 
The weirdest style for me easily goes to  the semi-iconic Balenciaga x Vibram split-toe rubber-bottomed heels. It sent the fashion world into a frenzy  as people attempted to decide if the design was avant-garde and fresh, or too similar to a less fashionable heel attached to the rock-climbing  shoe type. 
While the rubber bottom wasn’t the main concern for the latter interpretation, as the rubber sole is a staple in many of their shoe designs, it was instead, as expected, the incredibly distinct separation of each toe. Having tried it on myself, it is a weird feeling, and almost as if my toes were a little too spread apart. Not to mention, when you forget you are wearing them, looking down and seeing each one of your toes is very strange. 
Those were just the standouts from my extensive research that led me down an enthralling rabbit hole of footwear from past and current collections — I am obviously missing many more toes in footwear. It’s odd that an industry as precise as fashion can be so enthralled with features such as feet and irises. 
But I believe this is what makes fashion fun. It’s about finding new boundaries to push  and continuing to dance the pas de deux between old and new. With the push and pull of the disrupted trend cycle and continued variation in the economy and price ranges, it will be fascinating to keep seeing which cuts, styles and silhouettes will stay and which will take their final bow.

During my much needed spring break, my trip to Washington, D.C. perfectly aligned with a stretch of blue skies and warm sunshine. I loved my trip because — in addition to the perfect weather, great food and sightseeing — I had a new point of comparison. 
The last time I visited Washington, D.C., I was a fourth grader, ignorantly oohing and ahhing at every monument, unaware of inherent contradictions embedded in the framework of our capital’s history. This time, while I did not view each site with the same simplistic admiration and patriotism I had more than a decade ago, I felt my new viewpoint only enhanced the overall experience, as I thought more critically about the history and sights presented to me. 
During one of my walks to a Smithsonian museum, I noticed a man wearing a shirt that read “Museums Are Not Neutral.” This simple statement felt like a natural extension of the exact issues I’d thought about. While short and sweet, it says so much. Despite their attempts to convince us otherwise, museums are not an objective view of history. 
The statement on the man’s shirt ties to the broader Museums Are Not Neutral movement, which seeks to dismantle oppression and racism in museums. The movement believes institutions can fulfill their potential as agents for change by becoming more than passive institutions. La Tanya S. Autry, a co-producer of the movement, argues that museums are products of colonialism that emerge from a system of conquest. 
Think about it: Artifacts displayed in museums from other countries are often stolen during colonial rule or looted during war. Artifacts are taken from their original context, placed in a building thousands of miles away and given meaning dependent on whomever wrote the plaque that describes them. Mike Murawski, the other co-producer of the movement, claims that people must challenge dominant narratives by centering “marginalized histories, stories, voices and perspectives.” 
Around the time I went to D.C. the first time, I remember watching the movie “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian” (2009),  in which Ben Stiller’s character guards a museum with exhibits that come to life at night. A movie studio can choose a title as simple as “Battle of the Smithsonian” because it’s a household name. Some scenes were filmed at the actual Smithsonian; I remember how the museum felt even larger than life and prestigious on a big theater screen. 
With its tax-exempt status as an educational organization, the Smithsonian feels synonymous with knowledge and truth. However, even though Smithsonian museums are often cited as some of the best in the world, these exhibitions, like others, do not tell the full story. 
During my time in D.C., I visited both the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. While covering similar events, such as the American Revolution and the American Civil War, the two focus on vastly different perspectives, with NMAAHC highlighting Black experiences and points of view.  
Unlike the National Museum of American History, which briefly touches on slavery, the NMAAHC has an entire exhibit titled “The Paradox of Liberty,” featuring a statue of Thomas Jefferson with a caption that reads, “The paradox of the American Revolution — the fight for liberty in an era of widespread slavery — is embedded in the foundations of the United States.” Seeing both these museums back-to-back made me realize how much perspective changes the parts of history emphasized. 
While we can celebrate that the NMAAHC showcases a more nuanced history normally brushed aside, we still must engage with it carefully. The NMAAHC, like other Smithsonians, is funded and supported by the national government. Certain facts could be excluded that reflect poorly on the government. With any museum, we must consider who are the funders, who are the curators and who is the intended audience? 
When museums claim neutrality, they conflate neutrality with a history told by those in power. Museums cannot be neutral, for creating exhibits is in itself a biased act. However, museums can use the impossibility of maintaining neutrality positively, rather than to perpetuate current power structures. They must take an active stance that uplifts different perspectives and stories and not shy away from engaging with current movements. 
This is not to say I believe museums aren’t important. The Smithsonian Institute offers free admissions to the majority of its museums, and as humans seem bound to repeat mistakes, an accessible space to learn, educate and reflect is critical. 
For greatest impact, museums can not shy away from actively teaching all parts of history. Museums should not be a passive retelling of events that happened hundreds of years ago but a way to show how the effects of historical atrocities did not simply disappear, but connect to current day experiences. A person leaving a museum about the past should better understand the present and desire change for the future.

This year’s spring recess was the first real spring break for USC students since the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, for the majority, this was their first nondistanced and maskless spring break experience. 
Spring break has a reputation of being an extravagant weeklong bender where students travel to a tropical destination surrounded by the beach, good weather and plenty of parties. During this week, midterms and lectures are the last thing on students’ minds — rather, they’re focused on indulging in tequila and fish tacos. 
Whether it be Cabo or Maui, postpandemic college students are itching to leave their dorms behind and have fun. Since it was the first spring break for many, there was a looming pressure to have a memorable experience that is worth sharing on social media because if you’re not living it up in Cabo, what are you doing? 
While it’s not inherently wrong for college students to want to drink and party for a week in Mexico, it can be problematic when they’re partaking in extreme consumerism and neocolonialism.
According to Sarah N.R. Wijesinghe, Paolo Mura and Frederic Bouchon’s research on tourism, “tourism knowledge production and dissemination” comes from the commodification of culture via the exploitation of people, allowing colonialism and imperialism to continue. 
When foreigners visit tourist destinations, they’re contributing their wealth to the producers of tourist enterprises thus reinforcing unequal relationships of power. In turn, locals who aren’t generating profits are marginalized from mainstream economic structures, and lose control over their spaces and landscapes. 
This is evident in places, such as Hawaii, where tourism, produced primarily by non-Hawaiians, drives a large part of their economy. Most Native Hawaiian people work lower-paying service jobs, and some have to work more than one job to get by. Tourism is an incredibly damaging industry to Hawaii that leads to an increase of the cost of living and the price of goods and services.
Similarly, foreigners flock to Mexico capitalizing off its affordability, as Americans get nearly 20 Mexican pesos to the United States dollar. An environment like this might encourage people to consume in amounts that might exceed the rate of everyday consumer behavior, which further stimulates the tourist industry while marginalizing smaller local businesses. 
When college students visit these places, they overconsume and reinforce colonial power structures. While it might seem harmless, there are residual effects of vacationing abroad that students should be more aware of on their next trip. 
Along with neocolonialism, traveling out of the state and country for spring break poses a health risk for the inhabitants of the vacation destination, and for at-risk USC students in Los Angeles, as many seem to forget that we are not quite out of the pandemic just yet.
While the University did take spring break-related coronavirus precautions by requiring students to test after returning to campus, they should have implemented stricter quarantine measures post-break, such as a three to five-day quarantine for students who traveled out of state and Zoom accommodations for all students returning. 
The CDC recommends that returning travelers, particularly those that partook in large-scale gatherings, exercise caution and avoid those at higher risk of the coronavirus for two weeks, but how many students were truly cautious about the virus as they were partying it up in Palm Springs or Las Vegas?
So, does this mean students should stop traveling abroad for spring break entirely? 
There is no type of tourism that doesn’t, in some way, contribute to neocolonialism and capitalist industries. So, honestly, yes. 
It’s nearly impossible to avoid contributing to the tourism industry when traveling. If students must visit these places, they must be conscious of the lands and considerate to the people indigenous to these spaces. Students should at least learn the history of the places they travel to and be aware of how they affect local communities. Rather than giving white capitalists money, they should pay reparations directly to indigenous organizations. 
Spring break in places such as Mexico and Hawaii are almost like a rite of passage for college students. But, despite the large presence of spring break culture among students at USC, this rite of passage isn’t worth the harm it causes.
