It took almost 20 minutes for CBS to make the announcement on its annual selection show, but the USC men’s basketball team finally got word they will be going to the Big Dance after a one-year absence from the NCAA tournament.
The Trojans (19-14), with the benefit of an expanded 68-team tournament format this year, will travel to Dayton, Ohio to take on the VCU Rams (23-11) out of the Colonial Athletic Conference. The game will be played on Wednesday night for the right to be the No. 11 seed in the Southwest Region.
If USC prevails in the play-in game, they will take on the Georgetown Hoyas (21-10) out of the Big East Conference in Chicago, Ill. on Friday.
This is USC’s first tournament appearance under USC coach Kevin O’Neill, who was reinstated by athletic director Pat Haden on Sunday after serving a one-game suspension over the weekend for his involvement in an altercation on Thursday night.
The Trojans last tournament appearance was in 2009, where the team led by then-coach Tim Floyd defeated Boston College 72-55 in the first round, before falling to Michigan State 74-69 in the second round.

Despite a slow start against the likes of Washington and UCLA recently, the USC women’s tennis team wasted no time in putting down Fresno St. on Thursday, then beating Pepperdine on the road Saturday.
“We played really well in stretches this weekend, especially against a good Pepperdine team,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “[Pepperdine] played us really hard and we stuck it to them.”
In Malibu, the Women of Troy (10-2) continued their recent string of success with a decisive 5-1 win over the No. 30 Waves.
In what seemed to be the theme this weekend, USC started strong out of the gate, garnering victories at the top early and often, with quick wins by the No. 2 Sanchez and No. 18 sophomore Danielle Lao.
Sanchez has been dominant of late, especially in the singles department, and neither Marianne Jordan of Fresno State nor Pepperdine’s Arianna Colffer could slow her down.
Now at 25-1 overall, the senior has not only provided an automatic win for this season, but she has also helped groom Christian during their time playing doubles’ together.
Christian pulled eked out a victory against Pepperdine’s Ale Granillo with a 6-3, 5-7, 1-0 (10-8) win.
Now entrenched in the third slot, she will be relied upon to be a strong, consistent presence as the competition gets stiffer.
“[Kaitlyn] is a gamer,” Gallien said. “She plays so well and just continues to get stronger. It was a luxury to start her early, but now we need her against some of these other higher girls [No. 3s] even though she banged.”
Lao rebounded from a singles loss against Washington to pick up two victories, edging out Anamika Bhargava of Pepperdine 6-4, 6-2 and Fresno State’s Laura Pola 6-1, 6-2.
“Danielle is a tough trooper and she’s been playing hurt for awhile now,” Gallien said. “[Bhargava] has been Pepperdine’s No. 1 the last two years and it was good for Danielle to come out and beat her solidly.”
With sophomore Valeria Pulido out indefinitely with a stress reactor in her ankle, and without a timetable to return, junior Alison Ramos and senior Cristala Andrews each moved up a spot to No. 4 and No. 5 singles as senior Lyndsay Kinstler slid into the sixth spot.
Andrews, who has beaten up on lesser competition on court six this season, has now won two matches in a row, despite a previous 0-3 mark at the No. 5 spot in singles play before the weekend.
Facing an overmatched Bulldogs squad, USC rode the momentum from winning the doubles point, capped off by an 8-7 tiebreaker win by senior Maria Sanchez and freshman Kaitlyn Christian over Melissa McQueen/Marlanne Jodin, to win all but one singles match on the day and finish with a 6-1 victory.
This week, USC hosts a pair of home matches starting with Syracuse at 12 p.m. on Tuesday, March 15, before facing Arizona State at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 16.

With speculation that USC coach Kevin O’Neill may lose his job after this involvement in an altercation Thursday night inside the JW Marriott, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden answered the rumors with a decision about the coach’s immediate future.
Haden, who suspended O’Neill for the remainder of the Pac-10 tournament on Friday afternoon, decided to reinstate the coach on Sunday morning.
“Effective immediately, I am reinstating Kevin O’Neill as our men’s basketball head coach,” Haden said in a statement. “Coach O’Neill and I have talked numerous times these past few days. He has continued to express his regret and embarrassment over the incident that led to his suspension from any remaining games of the Pac-10 conference tournament. “
Haden did reiterate that although O’Neill would be reinstated immediately, the coach could still face internal discipline by the athletic department.
O’Neill’s one-game suspension came before his team’s biggest game of the year, in what turned out to be a 65-60 defeat to the Arizona Wildcats in the Pac-10 tournament semifinal.
The Trojans were coached on Friday night by head assistant coach Bob Cantu in the defeat.
USC awaits a decision on its postseason at 3 p.m. today when the NCAA Tournament’s field of 68 teams is announced.
Although the Trojans are currently listed as ESPN Bracketologist Joe Lundardi’s last team to receive an at large-bid, O’Neill admitted he feels at fault for the team’s shortcomings against Arizona.
“I temper my excitement of being reinstated with the realization that I made a serious error in judgment the other night,” O’Neill said in response to Haden’s decision. “The disciplinary measures that Pat Haden took, including the suspension, were absolutely the right call. My wife, Roberta, and I are both very apologetic for the embarrassment we caused the Trojan Family. We vow to move forward in a positive manner.”
