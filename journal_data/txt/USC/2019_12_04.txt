When Emily Johnson started at USC last year, she struggled with the transition from her hometown to a large private university. As a first-generation student, she has dealt with imposter syndrome, but she also needed help with time management skills, on-campus jobs and applications for financial aid and loans. 
All of that changed when Johnson signed up for an all-expenses-paid trip through the Marshall School of Business to Peru, which was open to under-represented students. 
Through the program, Johnson also attended weekly talks on campus focused on teaching students skills to succeed in college. The seminars helped her adjust to life at USC, but Johnson said she and many other first-generation students struggle to find these resources. 
Johnson, an Undergraduate Student Government senator, is working with Sens. Emily Donahue and Omar Garcia to propose a first-generation student center, where students can find all the resources available to them in one office. The three senators are working to co-author the proposal and create the center along with representatives from the First Generation Student Union, Fisher Fellows Program, Norman Topping Student Aid Fund and QuestBridge as well as other members of USG. 
Johnson said the center would not only help students find resources but also encourage them to reach out for help and services whenever they need it. 
“I think a lot of first-gen students end up just feeling like they’ve already asked for so much that they don’t want to ask for more, and it can really end up sending you back,” she said. “Because you don’t have as wide of a support system. You don’t come into college with networking connections, you have to build that from the ground up yourself.”
Donahue said the Norman Topping Student Aid Fund provided her, along with other students, with resources before classes started. The program, which provides scholarships and resources to first generation students at USC, had a three-day orientation for first-year students, which Donahue said helped connect her to a community of first-generation students. 
Donahue hopes the resource center can provide the same network for all first-generation students at USC, so students can talk about their shared experiences and share resources and tips they found useful.
“Being able to confide in someone and not have to feel embarrassed or explain the situation and just having someone to listen, that was just so helpful [for me] in a plethora of ways … especially [because] everyone’s just really supportive,” she said. 
Donahue said she doesn’t want the center to be limited by the University’s definition of a first generation student as someone whose parents don’t have a four-year degree. She said students from other backgrounds may face the same difficulties or define themselves as first generation and therefore should also have access to the same resources and community. 
“I think that it’s just needed at the University, especially with the intersectionality between … groups on campus who don’t have a space,” she said. “It can be like a Band-Aid on a bigger issue, which is like we need more space [for] a lot of different cultural groups and different identities, but I think it’s a really good start, especially granted the large amount of students who identify as first-gen.”
USG Chief Diversity Officer Jeffrey Cho is one of the people who could help the senators implement the center. As part of his position, Cho said he interacts with representatives from the Office of Student Affairs to explain student perspectives on the University and what solutions student groups would want to see implemented on campus. The representatives he meets with can then advocate for students’ wishes when talking with senior administration officials, he said. 
In the past three years, first-generation students have made up at least 15% of first-year incoming students. Cho said that though the University advertises the diversity of its incoming classes and student body, it should also create resources like the center to better serve those students. 
“I think that having a first-generation resource center would allow USC to put some impact behind those words and say that, you know, we do have the infrastructure in place to make sure that our first-generation college students get the educational experience that they deserve,” he said.
The University offers various resources for first generation students, including an alumni mentor program through the USC Career Center, a sophomore seminar that teaches students about future career paths and the Fisher Fellows Program, which assists Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences students to research with faculty, prepare for graduate school admissions and study abroad.
Johnson, Donahue and Garcia are currently working on finishing a proposal for the center and planning meetings with University administrators to start on their plans as soon as possible. 
Johnson said she questioned whether she belonged at USC. When she started here, she wants the center to be a space for students to come together and receive the resources they need to see that they can succeed in college. 
“I would hope you would sort of by building that community remind students like, ‘You are meant to be here. You made it here for a reason,’” she said. “And you might not have the same built-in network as some other students, but that’s OK because we’re going to build that and we’re going to help you through this.”

Leaders from Instagram and the Jed Foundation spoke  Wednesday about promoting healthy habits on social media for students through a mental health toolkit the two organizations created. 
The “Pressure to be Perfect” event promoted the 35-page booklet, which instructs students on mindful social media practices and cautions the negative impacts of excessive screen time. The toolkit includes tips on how to meaningfully use Instagram and three quizzes to assess one’s personal social media use. 
Instagram chose USC as the site to launch the toolkit to improve mental health resources for students.
“We were looking at social comparison and pressure and image, and what better place than to be in the heart of Los Angeles, of a place where that is really prevalent?”  said Carolyn Merrell, Instagram’s public policy manager. 
Media influencer Carri Twigg moderated the two panel discussions on the importance of healthy Instagram habits. The first panel featured Merrell, Cornell University researcher Janis Whitlock and JED’s chief medical doctor Victor Schwartz. 
Merrell said Instagram heard concerns from young people about how the platform affected their self image and decided to pursue a mental health initiative.
“On Instagram we see incredible things, we see people connecting with things that they love … but what we also see is that it can be a very complicated place,” Merrell said. 
Whitlock discussed her research on social media practices, which was used to help develop the toolkit. She connected with thousands of Instagram users from different countries to understand the typical experience on the platform and how it impacts their mental health. 
“The people who have figured out how to use it in the best way have figured out how to slot Instagram and other social media into the landscape of their life already,” Whitlock said. “It’s not something that they built their life around.” 
Schwartz emphasized that Instagram can help people connect around the globe, but also cautioned against using the platform as a way to create a disingenuous image. He said that the toolkit helps to solidify that message. 
The second panel featured social media influencers, including “Teen Wolf” actor Tyler Posey, former USC volleyball player and mental health advocate Victoria Garrick and Instagrammer Iffah Karim. The panelists described their personal journeys with Instagram and how to use the platform in a mindful way. 
Posey said he tries to portray himself realistically on Instagram to promote an authentic image to his nearly 6 million Instagram followers.
“I love that I have a following, that people listen to me … but I realize that I’m a role model whether I like it or not,” Posey said. 
Garrick said during her time at USC, she felt that she needed to cultivate a specific image on Instagram to get more likes and comments. She began Photoshopping herself to reflect common beauty standards, which led her to experience anxiety and body image issues.  
“I wasn’t accepting the fact that I was stressed, and I wasn’t feeling great and I wasn’t happy … I just kept trying to bury it with perfect pictures,” Garrick said. 
Daily Trojan associate managing editor Natalie Bettendorf spoke at the event.

The School of Cinematic Arts announced Wednesday it plans to keep its John Wayne exhibit but transform the space to represent the complex narrative of the American West at a panel discussion, titled “Examining Yesterday’s Culture Through Today’s Eyes.” In October, students protested the exhibit, which has come under fire from those claiming that Wayne was a problematic figure. 
Ultimately, the school decided not to remove the exhibit but rather to transform the space into a more complicated story about the American West in cinema. Each display case will be reimagined with elements of Indigenous filmmaking, feminism and critical race theory through interactive displays with the intention of facilitating viewer discussion. 
The largest case in the center of the exhibit will be removed altogether to allow for more open space for visitors to convene. 
Freshman film and television production major, Samuel Holley, agreed with SCA’s decision regarding the Wayne exhibit and said the message of adding depth to the narrative resonated with him. 
“Rather than just taking the entire thing down, I think renovating it and repurposing it to something more inclusive and all-encompassing of the Western genre that represents marginalized groups while also not shying away from the darker history is a very good move on SCA’s part,” Holley said. 
The panel featured three museum industry professionals, including W. Richard West Jr., Selma Holo and George Davis. They each spoke about their extensive experience and personal opinions regarding the cultural significance and social importance of exhibits that reflect history.  
Director of the USC Fisher Museum of Art and art history professor Selma Holo pressed the importance of transparency in museum culture and curation.
“We have to be [transparent], whether we are the makers of these shows, exhibitions and museums, or the visitors, because people like me are both […] we have to call it. We have to say ‘this is unfair, it’s unjust, it’s colonializing, it’s whatever it is, and I don’t think we can expect any museum to be perfect. We do, however, more and more, have the right to expect them to be transparent,” Holo said.
SCA received extensive backlash for the exhibit from USC students and alumni, as well as the general public. Given the immense outreach, the school has facilitated numerous discussions with SCA students and industry experts to decide on the best plan moving forward.
Eric Plant, a junior majoring in fine arts who created a banner protesting the exhibit, told the Daily Trojan in September that because of Wayne’s controversial stances and portrayal of Native Americans in film, he is “a blatant racist.” He said the actor promoted the genocide of indigenous Americans in his films.
“By keeping Wayne’s legacy alive, SCA is endorsing white supremacy,” the banner read.
Wayne attended and played football for USC before becoming an actor but is controversial for his stance on the treatment of people of color and indigenous people throughout history.
The Wayne Collection exhibit, which features a statue of Wayne along with several of his personal items in glass cases, was dedicated in June 2012. The collection contains a variety of Wayne film posters, memorabilia, awards and letters.    
Davis has led the California African American Museum since 2015. He said he uses his previous experience in the entertainment industry to focus on adapting museum culture and context for younger generations. He does this by refining the museum’s mission to showcase art, history and culture in new and innovative ways, he said.
“When I took over, my concern was that, especially if you’re culturally specific, whether it’s a Jewish museum, a Chinese American, Japanese, you’re trying to satisfy all aspects of the community,”  Davis said. “We just got to a place, when I took over, that we really felt it was hard to do that and we just decided we really needed to be a museum much more for younger people. So we went through a process of really everything.” 
Richard West, a citizen of the Cheyenne and Arapaho nation, is the president and CEO of the Autry Museum of the American West and has an extensive background working in the national and international museum communities. He has also worked as a lawyer advocating for indigenous rights before Congress and federal and tribal courts.
West sees museums and exhibits as environments and spaces for conversation rather than pure display. He discussed his experiences working for various museums and stated that museums today must not operate in the same way as in previous centuries.
“I happen to think they are not simply houses of objects,” West said. “They are something very different, I think, in the 21st century. They need to strive to be gathering places for conversation, debate, consideration, even controversy. But safe places for unsafe ideas.”

The USC football program has seen plenty of change since 1969. 
It’s seen 10 different head coaches. Countless student-athletes. The highs, five claimed national titles; the lows, four losing seasons. It’s seen Junior Seau, Troy Polamalu, Sam Darnold. Scandal and vacated wins.
Unsurprisingly, almost nothing about USC football in 1969 remotely resembles anything from 2019 — that is, apart from Arthur Bartner.
Bartner is just a few weeks away from his final game as director of the USC marching band, a tenure atop the ladder that’s occupied 50 years of his life but hasn’t lost an ounce of the energy that’s turned him into a staple of Trojan football. 
“Looking back, I think I was always this way,” Bartner said of his enthusiasm that has left many wondering how he hasn’t lost his voice over the years. “I was always after perfection … I can’t remember not being the way I am today.”
USC’s bowl game this month will mark the end of Bartner’s time at USC, which started in the John McKay era. Over the years, the Spirit of Troy has become one of the most famous and renowned in the country. 
In that same time frame, the football team has also become one of the most historic college programs in the nation, winning 14 Rose Bowls, five NCAA championships and claiming five Heisman winners. 
Bartner believes the band and team’s successes go hand-in-hand.
“I really feel that I’m part of this game, I feel the band is part of this game,” Bartner said. “You not only have to play the team, you have to play the band. [Opponents know] we’re gonna play these tunes over and over again, we’re gonna be annoying, our crowd’s gonna be loud. And you have to believe that that helps win games.”
Excellence has always been the goal for Bartner, and watching one of his band’s practices, it’s clear he won’t quit until it’s achieved. He’ll yell at kids if they’re not perfectly in line, if anything sounds the slightest bit off or if he feels any of the members aren’t giving it their all.
“We work hard to produce shows we are proud of, and Dr. Bartner won’t let us settle for anything less,” said trombone player Elyse Pollack, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering. “Dr. Bartner acts like a sports coach to motivate us and prevent us from getting lazy throughout the season.”
The Spirit of Troy is most often associated with USC football, but Bartner’s band has made a name for itself time and time again — including its 1979 collaboration with Fleetwood Mac for “Tusk,” which made USC the only collegiate band with a top-10 hit. 
For Bartner, it’s that song that carries the most meaning but the classics that define the University.
“‘Tribute to Troy,’ ‘Fight On,’ ‘Conquest.’ That’s what I call the soundtrack of USC,” Bartner said. “People ask all the time, ‘Am I tired [of] playing these tunes?’ And I’m really not.”
Those three songs have become essential parts of jock rallies, pregame and halftimes shows and seemingly ring throughout the Coliseum hundreds of times per game.
“There’s always been a tremendous connection between the band and the Trojan football team,” former USC head coach Pete Carroll said in an email to Daily Trojan. “We would always tap in and benefit from the energy and excitement they’d bring on gamedays, and their daily practices during the week were a driving force for us too.”
The band has earned a reputation as one of the crazier, more energetic and borderline obnoxious bands in college, and any of their performances will make it clear where that energy originates. 
“Dr. Bartner has an obvious intensity about him,” Carroll said. “He lives with a unique zeal that’s ever-present.”
That intensity manifests as a strong physical presence.
“He could command the band with a single hand gesture,” said Jonathan Goody, a former Spirit of Troy trumpeter from USC’s class of 1987. 
Bartner knows no other way to operate. He has a reputation for being tough on band members and calling out fans at rallies who aren’t cheering loud enough for USC. Off the field, he’s an entirely different person: calm, friendly and approachable. He even describes himself as “dull” and “boring” at home. 
But when he’s on top of the ladder, it’s all business. 
“I try to embrace this Trojan spirit, this Trojan Family,” Bartner said. “And I get on the mic, and I have to admit, I’m like a man possessed … Hey, we’ve got to go out, we have a job to do. That’s to support this team and win some ballgames.”
Bartner’s band has done just that. He was there for The Comeback in 1974, the Bush Push in 2005 and the Darnold-orchestrated Rose Bowl victory in 2017 — his three favorite football moments from the 50 years. 
Now, Bartner will look to lead the band — and the football team — to one final victory before he departs, having spent half a century as the face of the Spirit of Troy.
“It hasn’t hit me yet that this is all over,” Bartner said.
After Bartner’s retirement, the band will go on. It won’t stop calling itself “The Greatest Marching Band in the History of the Universe.” It won’t stop sending the whole group to Notre Dame or the Weekender. It won’t stop playing “Tribute to Troy.” 
Though many things will remain, it just might not sound the same without Dr. Bartner leading the way.

The USC men’s water polo team is preparing to compete in its 15th straight NCAA Tournament this weekend. In their previous 14 trips, the Trojans captured eight national championships. Overall, USC has made 34 appearances in the NCAA Championships.
Coming off a season in which the team won its 10th national championship, the Trojans hope to make it to the mountaintop for the second straight year when they compete in Stockton, Calif. starting Thursday. 
Last season, the Trojans were one of the best teams in the nation, compiling a record of 30-3 and taking down Stanford in a nail-biter to win the national championship. It was almost as if the team was unbeatable during the 2018 regular season, having only lost one game.
On the other hand, this season has not been exactly what USC hoped for. With five losses this season, the Trojans have their worst record since 2015. However, not all hope is lost; the team has been on a hot streak of late and is currently ranked No. 2 nationally.
Much of the team’s recent success can be attributed to star junior driver Jacob Mercep, the team’s scoring leader with 43 goals. 
This is good news for a team that was once ranked as low as No. 7 this season. Having won five of their last six games, the Trojans hope to continue their momentum into the NCAA Tournament.
USC’s record is not necessarily an accurate representation of its performance, as all five of its losses have been a difference of four goals or less. The Trojans also have a perfect conference record and went undefeated at home for the first time since 2016.
“I’m trying to just help my teammates get through it, have everybody focused and on the same page,” said senior 2-meter Sam Slobodien. “I know if we work together and play well, we’ll do our best and we’re gonna end up winning.”
Slobodien has been a strong player for the Trojans all season long. The 6-foot-4 All-American has 25 goals on the season, good for fifth on the team. As one of the captains of the team, he hopes to maintain that same mindset as the team prepares for another tournament run. 	
“We’re going to give  the same preparation we give every week,” Slobodien said. “But there’s always that extra little edge you have going into the finals.”	
Having spent 18 previous years on the coaching staff, Marko Pintaric took over head coaching duties this season, as well as head coaching duties for the women. 
In Pintaric’s first full season as head coach, the Trojans have outscored their opponents 254-179 with an offense generating 13.37 goals per game. Moreover, USC’s defense has kept its opponents to fewer than 10 goals per game. Pintaric has definitely not disappointed at the helm of one of the best water polo programs in the country.
The NCAA Tournament consists of seven teams and includes a majority California field: Pepperdine, UC Davis, Pacific and Stanford are all participating. USC defeated Stanford earlier this season but  lost to Pacific and Pepperdine in one-score games.
If the Trojans hope to make it to the national championship game, they will have to beat Bucknell and then take on Stanford. The Cardinal, who hold a 19-2 record this season, will not be an easy out. But with players like Slobodien and Mercep, the Trojans are staying confident as they prepare for this weekend.
“I feel confident,” Slobodien said. “Obviously I hope we come out with a natty so that’s how I always feel. Everybody always goes to bed every night thinking about it, then you wake up thinking about it.”	
The Trojans will start the tournament on Thursday when they take on the Bucknell Bison in a 1 p.m. tilt in Stockton, Calif.

Before sophomore goalie Nic Porter made the life-upending decision to travel around the world to play water polo, he found himself watching dozens of games — regardless of level — to build the intelligence he believes is vital to the success of a goalie. 
There was one game in particular that made the choice easier for him.
Porter placed himself in then-USC freshman goalie McQuin Baron’s shoes when he faced crosstown rival UCLA in the 2014 NCAA Championship final. The Trojans were gearing up for a shot to win in overtime, and the score was even for the first time in the game at 8-8. But with 34 seconds to go, sophomore center Gordon Marshall of UCLA made the game-winning point and claimed the NCAA title for the Bruins.
This was Porter’s first introduction to the USC water polo program. 
“I was just in awe of how the players were playing,” he said. “I was like, wow, this would be an amazing thing to do.”
Growing up along the Sunshine Coast in Australia, Porter was constantly near the water and in the sun. With a push from a school mentor, he was convinced that water polo was just a natural extension of his upbringing. 
“Water polo wasn’t really something that I had thought of until I was about 9 and my sport-gym teacher in Australia kind of said, ‘You’re good at soccer. You’re a good swimmer. Water polo is a great combination of the two. I think you’ll really like it,’” Porter said. “And yeah, I fell in love with it straightaway.”
His parents, by email, described Porter’s gradual acclimation to the sport fondly. He began with close observation and gained what he could from the other, more experienced players.
“Nic has always entered new team environments quite cautiously, saying little but watching, listening and learning the culture before introducing himself,” said Stephen Porter, Nic’s father. “He knew he was one of the ‘new kids’ and he would have to train hard, play well and contribute to the continuing success of the program before he was accepted.”
Porter began as a goalie for the club Sunshine Coast, playing with teammates his own age and getting used to the different facets of the game. He laughs when he remembers one of his favorite memories from that team when he was 12, playing in the state championship and losing every game by about 20 points. It’s not exactly the picture-perfect victory he may have hoped for, but after being chosen for the state representative team following this tournament performance, he was inspired to see what avenues hard work could lead him toward.
He describes a marked difference in intensity when he transitioned to his senior club team, the Queensland Breakers, at 16 years old. 
“I was playing with men, with the best players in Australia week in, week out,” he said. “I had to mature very quickly and get used to the highest standard of water polo really quickly, but I think that’s also an advantage too.”
“You get thrown into the deep end, pardon the pun,” he laughed.
Watching that NCAA championship upset for USC did not add to the pressure Porter experienced as he was moving up the ranks of the Australian senior team. Instead, it only solidified his decision to make the trip around the world to join the Trojans in their efforts.
“Yeah, that’s a dream come true right there,” Porter said. “I’ve been fortunate to play in some amazing countries, but to live here in Los Angeles and go to USC and play collegiate water polo — that’s the stuff dreams are made of. I’m so happy to be here.”
Head coach Marko Pintaric knew of Porter during the recruitment process and said the coaching staff’s initial evaluation of him was well-founded and deserved.
“It didn’t change,” Pintaric said of their original assessment of Porter. “He’s a scholarship goalie. And he’s doing a great job improving and constantly dealing with injuries and, you know, correcting getting from being injured to being healthy and then making corrections or not to have a standout performance.”
Porter came to USC with a young goalie group, the oldest being then-sophomore Vaios Vlahotasios. While he created an environment where Porter had to make his mark and break the mold, succeeding by appearing in 19 games as a true freshman, the strength of his partnership with his fellow goalies never wavered. 
“Oh, it’s awesome,” said Vlahotasios emphatically. “He’s my best buddy in the pool. Each one of us is pushing each other; I’m making him better, he’s making me better. We share tips because we never know who’s gonna play … It’s a great dynamic.”
And it’s not a dynamic that is exclusive to the goalies. Porter can be seen in the cage cheering for his teammates after a great shot or block, demonstrating his positivity and unique ability to balance his goals with the rest of the team’s. 
This companionship is also visible outside of games and practice, as Porter describes the team’s weekend trips to the beach or video game sessions after a long day of classes. Any extra time the players have outside of their hectic schedule is spent  hanging out with each other.
“I always have the attitude when I get in the pool that I don’t want anyone to touch the wall ahead of me,” Porter said. “I don’t want anyone to use their legs so that they’re higher out of the water than me. I always want to be the best. I always want to win, and I came in and this was by far the best group of goalies that I’d ever had to compete with, but also train with because we’re teammates first and foremost. So that’s definitely motivating in itself.”
When Porter started in last year’s championship final, he  saw himself in former goalie McQuin Baron, who faced the same situation in 2014. Porter came away with a win as a true freshman with 12 saves in the title game. This year, he intends to bring the same energy to the NCAA Tournament in Stockton, which seems to foretell a great performance with 9.57 saves per game this season and a career-high 20 saves against No. 1 Stanford last month. 
“We really needed to win that game,” Porter said of their win against the Cardinal. “So to give ourselves the best chance of qualifying for NCAA, and … I was really happy to get 20 blocks, but it was my teammates … that made it a lot easier for me than it could have been.”
Now that the time has come to prove themselves after a rocky start to the season against solid opponents on all sides, Porter sees the Trojans making a strong statement at their 15th consecutive trip to the NCAAs and in future campaigns.
“I’d love to graduate from here with four national championships,” Porter said. “I think that that’s very possible with the team that we have. It’s still quite a young team.”
“We can’t let that youth become our detriment,” he said.

Anger and frustration were the dominant sentiments expressed by college football coaches this week. 
Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh and Washington State head coach Mike Leach lashed out at reporters who questioned why they couldn’t vanquish their biggest rivals. Harbaugh is 0-5 against Ohio State during his tenure and said he won’t respond to insults when asked about his record. 
Leach has lost his last seven matchups against Washington. He went as far as to tell a reporter to live his “little meager life” when asked if he was capable of overcoming recruiting deficiencies to beat the Huskies. 
Even coaches who have no real reason to be frustrated were frustrated Saturday. After his team dispatched South Carolina to improve to 12-0, Clemson’s Dabo Swinney went on a tirade about how the Tigers get no respect from the College Football Playoff committee because of their perennially weak schedules playing in the ACC. 
“They don’t want us in there anyway,” Swinney said. “We’d drop to 20 [with a loss], you know? Georgia loses to this very same team, and the very next day it’s, ‘How do we keep Georgia in it?’ We win to the team [North Carolina] that beat South Carolina and it’s, ‘How do we get Clemson out?’”
If the committee’s prerogative is to “get Clemson out,” it’s doing a mind-bogglingly terrible job of it. The Tigers have made the playoff in each of the past four seasons despite losing to unranked teams twice over that span. Swinney’s misplaced anger resembles the Simpsons grandpa-screaming-at-clouds meme. 
It’s easy to write this off as typical chippiness during the final week of the season, when the struggle of a long year has turned into a downright slog.
But something else is happening here. Due to the new early signing period and increased pressure to win in the College Football Playoff era, coaches are getting burnt out more so than ever before. 
There’s no better example of this than Chris Petersen’s resignation from Washington Monday. Petersen led the Huskies to the College Football Playoff in 2016 and 10 wins in three of the last four seasons. And yet, he felt the need to step away from it all. 
“It becomes a lot of frustration and anxiety and stress,” said Petersen in the press conference announcing his departure. “Some of the excitement and positivity and optimism can kind of be pushed away. That’s never a way to live your life.” 
Petersen’s 14 seasons as a Division I football coach certainly played a role in his burnout, but so did the increased pressure that comes with the job both on and off the field. 
National Signing Day used to take place strictly in February, but a new early signing period was added for the 2017 college football season. While voted in by coaches who wanted more certainty over their recruiting classes entering spring practice, the measure has completely changed their calendars and placed incoming coaches at a severe disadvantage (they now have mere weeks to put together the core of their first class, as opposed to a few months). 
This also means fewer opportunities for coaches to get breaks during and immediately after the season. Then, once the first signing period begins, the rush to add players in February starts. 
North Dakota State athletic director Matt Larsen foresaw this being a problem for coaches back in 2017. 
“These guys do it because they love it,” Larsen told the Grand Forks Herald. “But as an administrator, I worry about burnout with recruiting calendars. I have concerns with every sport. There are way too many recruiting days.”
There have been many discussions about mental health among student-athletes, but maybe it’s time to start looking after coaches, too. The job will always be a tiresome grind, but adding more mandatory dead recruiting periods or eliminating the early signing period could help prevent coaches like Petersen from burning out. 
During a press conference this week, Swinney joked that adults, not first-graders, should get “nap time.” All coaches could use a little more rest.

I can’t focus on schoolwork because my classmates are dying. When I was accepted into the No.1 film school in the nation, not once did it cross my mind that I would lose classmates along the way. And yet, three students in my grade at the School of Cinematic Arts have died — one due to suicide, two to undisclosed causes. 
How does this happen? No one can say for certain, but the pressure-cooker environment where imposter syndrome runs rampant and mental health resources are lacking could be a contributor.
At SCA, you don’t begin making films until your second semester. In the introductory course titled “Lateral Thinking for Filmmaking Practice,” you make films independently every week, highlighting the disparity of technical skill in the class. For students like me, who lacked technical skill in comparison to the cinematography virtuosos, this class was terrible. 
I felt nauseous every time the class watched and critiqued my work — especially after watching so many objectively better films. I constantly questioned if I had been accepted to this school by clerical error. It wasn’t until the end of the semester that we had an open discussion as a class where we all admitted feeling that same sense of dread every time we showed our work to each other. We’re all close friends and collaborators, but the program is inherently competitive, and the comparison aspect only gets worse as you enter upper-division classes. 
The junior thesis class called “Intermediate Production” — commonly known to us as “310” from its course code — is a rite of passage within SCA. Everyone is divided into trios in this class, and each member of the trio has five weeks to write and direct their own film. As soon as this project is completed, trio members rotate roles, assisting the next member as they direct their own film. Each trio ultimately produces three films in 15 weeks. 
The class is everyone’s last guaranteed opportunity to direct at school before the process becomes more competitive and selective in our senior year. And since it’s everyone’s last guaranteed opportunity to direct at school, we place a lot of importance on these films. Your 310 film is forever associated with your name. Some go on to film festivals, and others are merely forgotten. Either way, the process is grueling. 
It was during 310 that my classmate dropped out for mental health reasons. When he returned a year later, he joined the cohort one year below us. A month ago, he passed away midway during the second project. According to one of his classmates, he showed all the signs that he was in distress and at risk of hurting either himself or someone else. He was dealing with severe personal issues, but the rigid schedule of the class does not allow for anyone to step back for even a moment. Being tied to a trio prevents many from prioritizing their own mental health for fear of negatively affecting the film.
The screenwriting program at USC is just as intensely rigorous as production, with a course plan so rigid that it’s not possible to even transfer into the major — one still must complete four years in the program. The senior cohort of screenwriters has recently experienced immense loss with the deaths of two of their classmates. One over a year and a half ago, and one mere weeks ago. 
Just last November, John Lynch, then a junior in the screenwriting program, had organized a comedy show to raise money for suicide awareness in honor of his close friend Mckenna Martin. Now he’s gone, too. 
And with the emptiness left in their wake, we are all struggling as a community to focus on our scripts and films, not to mention homework beyond SCA. I find myself missing classes to console crying friends and mourn together. My classmates have made a point of reminding each other how much we love and value each other. The sense of community is much needed right now, but this should not be a normal part of college. No one should have to mourn their friends at such a young age. But more importantly, no one should be dying at this age.
Reaching out for help is never easy, but it’s especially difficult when you’re surrounded by high-achieving peers who appear to be handling the same workload with grace. My personal journey to accepting help and starting therapy was a long one. When I broke down a couple weeks into my own 310 semester, my mom heavily encouraged me to seek counseling. 
My entire family goes to counseling and is very pro-therapy, but I could not bring myself to call the health center number. I kept making excuses about not having time. I couldn’t work fewer hours because then I couldn’t afford rent, and slacking on my 310 duties was not an option. 
I think part of it was simply fear of confirming that I was not OK. Everyone else was losing sleep and dedicating all their free time to 310, so I felt like I needed to tough it out and do the same. I told a close friend that I would reach out to the Engemann Student Health Center, but it took me almost an entire year to finally do it. The next semester I worked 30 hours a week on top of school and lost most weekends to film shoots, so I genuinely could not find time to see a therapist. But that’s when I needed help the most. 
Unfortunately, the “no time for therapy” mentality is common among my peers at SCA. 
Many of us are struggling with anxiety and depression, but the intense nature of our major keeps us from prioritizing our own mental health. We stack internships (mostly unpaid) on top of passion projects beyond our course loads, all for the sake of keeping up with our successful classmates and guaranteeing post-grad prospects. 
We cry privately and succeed publicly. We maintain these unsustainable schedules and don’t find time to fit in therapy when we so desperately need it. 
At this point, it’s up to the school to step in.
It’s clear that the Engemann can’t accommodate the volume of struggling students in SCA, but a change in the school’s competitive culture is long overdue. When students feel like they have to accept an internship and they have to work on as many projects as possible, they prioritize that over getting help. 
Perhaps introducing us to this school by telling us it’s the “first day of your career” and that the people sitting next to you will be “the ones who hire and fire you” doesn’t perpetuate the most healthy environment. 
It’s a competition from day one, and there’s no room for mistakes when we believe our careers are on the line. I know it’s not easy out in the real world, but SCA is a training facility. It’s meant to be a place to learn from mistakes, but that can’t happen when rigid deadlines and unhealthy dependency of teammates don’t allow for a margin of error. We can’t claim to be a “process over product” institution when we are all working intensely toward a product and gaining nothing from mistakes in the process phase.
I will be graduating at the end of this semester, and my only regret is not speaking up about this sooner. I would love to leave knowing that SCA is a safer environment for future generations of overworked film students. 
We may be hurting right now, but this is an opportunity to make meaningful changes to a program that has lost too many students. Cultivating a more supportive culture where students are able to make mistakes and able to step back when necessary is what so many students not only want, but need — and we need it right now.

We have officially crossed over into December and the holiday season. This means it’s now socially acceptable to go all out decorating, drinking hot chocolate and feeling festive. Despite the excitement of the holidays and winter break, it is far too easy for students to spend the majority of their December consumed with stress about finals.
Students should not let finals stop them from celebrating the holidays, despite the stress they bring. In fact, students can benefit from taking a break to put up a few decorations around their dorm or apartment. This makes one’s living space homier at a time when students may be feeling especially homesick or stressed. 
This year, the first official day of winter break is Dec. 19, meaning finals run very close to holidays like Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas, leaving very little time for students to go home to celebrate the holidays without schoolwork looming over them. 
It is understandable that students may not feel like listening to “Joy to the World” when they have a paper due Monday, a final on Tuesday and a project due Wednesday. However, even though the joy of the holidays seems antithetical to the stress of finals, in reality, the two are not mutually exclusive. 
In fact, at a time when anxiety and stress levels may be high, studies have shown that decorating for the holidays can be beneficial. Psychoanalyst Steve McKeown found that decorating for the holidays can make a person happier, igniting feelings of childhood magic and nostalgia. Many of these feelings are experienced on the actual holidays themselves, but extending the celebration can keep the lively mood in the air for longer. 
Additionally, decorations remind people of family and a time when they were with less responsibility — a brief reprieve from current stress about responsibilities and tasks. 
Studies have also shown that putting up home decorations makes neighbors feel like that person is more sociable and friendly. In this way, decorations not only benefit a person on an individual level, but can make a whole dorm hallway or apartment complex feel more welcoming and interactive. Isn’t unity and togetherness one of the main purposes of the holiday season? Displaying your holiday spirit could lead to neighbors feeling more comfortable to interact with each other and engage in conversation, which in turn might lead to new connections. 
Some students may catch the “holiday homesick blues,” where they miss their family and would rather be at home preparing for the holiday season. These feelings may only be exacerbated by the mundane routine of studying and test-taking. Putting up a string of colorful lights can break the monotony of finals and diminish feelings of homesickness by making one’s living space feel more like a home away from home.
Finding decorations to put up can be as simple as a quick trip to the Target at USC Village or the push of a button on Amazon to buy things like Christmas stockings, snowflake decals or a fire-safe LED menorah or kinara. Putting up decorations could be as easy as using post-it art on windows to form a Christmas tree or heart. Or why not buy some construction paper and make some homemade snowflakes with friends?
Of course, it is perfectly understandable that not everyone associates joy with the holiday season or want to partake in the commercialism of buying decorations or gifts. But as we reach the homestretch — and very stressful — part of the semester, the main takeaway is to findthings that spark joy and feelings of togetherness instead of immersing oneself completely in finals. 
For students who do enjoy celebrating during the holidays, don’t let the feelings surrounding finals stop you from blasting Mariah Carey’s song “All I Want for Christmas Is You” while wearing fuzzy socks and building a gingerbread house!

Let there be no doubt that the public spread of disinformation poses an existential threat to our democracy. 
In 2016, a concerted campaign by Russian actors targeted swing voters to sway them toward voting for then-presidential nominee Donald Trump. Some of the ads tried to convince Democrats that they could vote by texting “Hillary” to an unlisted number. More recently, a video ad from the Trump campaign spread the unevidenced claim — or lie, if you prefer — that former Vice President Joe Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating his son Hunter Biden’s company.   
Facebook’s refusal to remove the video, and its broader policy to not fact-check political ads run on the platform, has drawn considerable criticism, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren calling the platform a  “disinformation-for-profit machine.” Even Facebook employees have called for the company to amend its policy on political misinformation, but Mark Zuckerberg, in the supposed interest of free speech, has refused to change the company’s position. 
It’s important to remember what’s at stake here: Democracy, which depends on a shared set of facts, has begun to flounder as we cordon ourselves off into separate echo chambers. 
We cannot have fair elections if people vote based on misbeliefs, like claims that Biden is guilty of the same sort of alleged misdeed that Trump actually did commit. The ongoing impeachment inquiry attests to the reality that Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to pressure them into investigating Biden and his son. Trump and his campaign have popularized the idea that the opposite is true. 
This muddying of the water prevents fact from prevailing over fiction in elections, the impeachment process and the public eye. The problem clearly needs to be addressed, but the best solution is not so clear. 
Unlike Facebook, Google has decided to ban all political ads targeting voters based on their political preferences or voting records. 
Though the intent of this policy is to target disinformation, the true impact will land on smaller, grassroots political campaigns that don’t have the funds for broad and unspecific advertisements. The actual problem will remain largely unchecked, as disinformation campaigns are largely built on the sharing of troll-generated content rather than the purchase of political ads. 
Twitter took a more heavy-handed approach, banning all political ads from the platform. CEO Jack Dorsey argued that “political message reach should be earned, not bought.” The idea is sound — that selling political reach undermines the democratic ideal of social media: Each idea gets equal standing among a wider audience. 
Despite its good intent, the choice is a cop-out. 
Like Google’s new policy, the ban does not target troll farms responsible for the majority of disinformation campaigns. Additionally, the policy targets all political advertising, which includes those with “the primary goal of driving political, judicial, legislative, or regulatory outcomes.” This means that a climate change organization would be prevented from buying ads on Twitter, whereas an oil company would have free reign to promote false or misleading information. Educational ads on immigration and health care reform would be similarly barred from the platform.  
Facebook’s hands-off approach on political lies is not popular, but at least it isn’t rash: It doesn’t harm down-ballot candidates or hamper positive political reform. The wide reforms put in place by Google and Twitter are attractive. They seek to address the growing problem of mistruth in politics, but the real problem can hardly be solved by eliminating political ads altogether. 
Ultimately, it is up to people to check facts and discern truth, not the platforms to broadly prevent speech — true or false — from reaching the public. After all, asking Facebook to fact-check every political ad that crosses its platform allows a private corporation to be the arbiter of truth for over 2 billion people. This is a tremendous and troubling responsibility, and it should not be left to any one institution. 
This is an exciting moment in our history: The problem of political disinformation has been thrust into the center of our attention. We are weighing our values of truth and free speech against one another, and so our decision must be deliberate, not based on knee-jerk reasoning. 
If Facebook wishes to be measured in its approach, not limit speech in broad strokes, we might do well to respect their restraint.

Over the semester, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to share my love for cannabis and its benefits through this column. While I fully intend on a reprisal next semester, it is still astonishing to me that this initial chapter has come to a close.
From writer’s block to my incessant inability to concentrate, from fear of backlash from conservatives to the thrill of readers praising my work — I went through a rollercoaster of emotions and thoughts as I wrote. 
With my early columns, I sought to set the stage with the inner workings of the world of cannabis: the culture, politics, history and sociology of weed. But I’ve never really touched on the role weed has played in my life and the lives of my loved ones. 
To be blunt, I was scared. And I still am. 
It’s disheartening to me that weed is still treated as a taboo subject and substance, derided as an indicator of someone’s lack of potential or direction in life. It upsets me when people look at me differently when I tell them (or they find out) I use cannabis. Pot, just like most things, is not one-dimensional; each and every individual who uses weed does so for myriad reasons.
My journey with weed really began in college, save a few encounters with the substance due to my cliché high school rebellion phase and intense curiosity. Graduating from smoking mid-grade weed in a dark, stuffy garage with people I barely knew to enjoying luxurious hits from a PAX Era freshman year with my closest friends was a definite upgrade.
What I used to consider secretive and audacious soon became a therapeutic ritual; granted, while I enjoyed the high, like most of my friends, I smoked because I needed to and because doing so genuinely helped me.
I’ve struggled with bouts of mild depression since I was 15 and recently developed generalized and social anxiety disorders. The process of labeling how I felt was frustrating, confusing and demoralizing; for the longest time, and even now, I believed what I felt was the norm — that everyone lost their appetite sporadically, felt hopeless and guilty without cause and struggled constantly under a heavy, gray weight in their chest.
Outside of journaling, making art and listening to music, weed is one of the only outlets through which I find solace. When I feel overwhelmed by sadness and the seeming bleakness of the world around me, or panicked over nothing —  and  fixated on minute details and social encounters — a puff or two helps calm my nerves, ease my stress and slow things down.
Cannabis, which I sometimes pair with self-guided meditation, allows me to live more mindfully, bringing more awareness to my emotions and helping me work through them. Especially after particularly challenging days, weed makes me feel like I can breathe deeply again, giving me a chance to regain a sense of tranquility.
Other times, cannabis just makes me feel happier. THC, which interacts with the reward system in the brain, acts similarly to the naturally occurring neurotransmitter anandamide, aptly named the “bliss molecule,” producing feelings of joy.
Of course, I’m not a stranger to the occasional bad high or panic associated with cannabis-induced anxiety since THC can sometimes produce opposing feelings to bliss. For the most part though, THC lowers my anxiety, helping me control my panic attacks and ease my tension. 
My friends and older brother use cannabis, also to self-medicate for anxiety purposes. Surprisingly, even the rest of my family — a staunchly conservative and traditional bunch of immigrants — has embraced the healing qualities of cannabis, using CBD to help with the pain and inflammation associated with migraines and arthritis.
My grandma, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, used both THC and CBD to treat her chemotherapy-induced nausea, appetite loss, insomnia, pain and depression daily up until her death two-and-a-half months ago. When her health significantly deteriorated in the last weeks, cannabis was one of the only things that helped her manage her intense pain and sadness. 
Cannabis moderated a large part of the grieving process for me, as did time and therapy. 
Weed helped me throughout my bouts of intense anxiety, immobilizing depression and withdrawal from society. During a particularly bad panic attack where I felt like the world was spinning out of control and I couldn’t catch my breath no matter how hard I tried, weed (and calling my mom) helped me regain a sense of stability. 
All this is to say that cannabis has genuinely enabled me to get closer to reaching peace. While I’m still grieving and every day is a battle for happiness, weed has allowed me to lead a better, healthier life — both physically and mentally.
As with all substances, cannabis has risks and side effects. While the jury is still out on whether cannabis is good for long-term mental health, this is just my experience and the benefits I have reaped from the substance. 
And by no means am I saying that cannabis is a substitution for professional medical advice, therapy and prescriptions, even as more Americans are turning to self-medication as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs. 
Cannabis and wellness compose a joint effort for me. Weed isn’t just a punchline, stereotype or substance indicative of a homogenous consumer base; for me, it’s a deeply personal method of healing, a way for me to gain a sliver of hope in all of the chaos.
What does weed mean to me? Everything and nothing all at once. While it is a significant part of my life and who I am, it is not wholly suggestive of my personhood nor is it a condition of my flaws as a human.

Sporting pink and purple hair, a long-sleeve T-shirt featuring characters from the animated children’s series “Rugrats,” pizza socks and a pair of Vans, Claire Julian arrived to her interview with the Daily Trojan in her own style — a scar near her eyebrow from a skateboarding incident only completed the look.
“I totally face-planted,” Julian said, laughing. “I had to get stitches, it was kinda cool. It really gave me a lot of skater cred.”
The junior majoring in creative writing represents some classic punk tropes, from her skating injury to her scattered tattoos. But her punk qualities transcend her appearance: her music follows the genre, too.
Julian, the frontwoman of no reception., started the new wave punk band as her solo project in 2015. Most recently, she covered Halsey’s song “Nightmare” in a music video she planned and filmed with her friend Crow Brennan in New York City. 
Just as visually compelling as her personal style, the video depicts Julian playing guitar and drums and singing in an all-white room. Some shots show Julian in a black tie, white button-up and slacks; in others, she is in her underwear with insults she has received written on her body in red paint. 
In the video’s caption, Julian posted a “manifesto” about what inspired her to make and film the cover, which condemns labels and encourages empathy regardless of identity.
“I think every artist has their own way of pushing boundaries,” said Brandon Douglass (stage name Brandon Movay), a senior majoring in creative writing and fellow musician, in response to watching the music video. “With her, it’s very visual.”
Beyond visuals, Julian stands out with her playful lyricism.
“Can I offer you a candy cigarette? I know you don’t like to smoke, it goes straight to your head,” said Julian, quoting her song “Penny.” “It’s kind of quirky. No one would ever do that.”
“Penny,” a love song about a fictional girl, shows Julian’s tendency to write about her experience as a queer woman, to which she said her fans especially relate. In the past, writing about her sexuality felt forced. 
“I felt like, ‘Oh, should I not write too many queer songs because then that’ll be my thing?’ But then I was like, ‘Well, that is my thing because I am queer,’” Julian said. “Now, I don’t even think about it, and it has resulted in my music being super queer, but it’s not something I’m trying to do. It’s just a reflection of myself.”
Although she says the writing aspect is natural to her, Julian expressed how much of a conscious effort she has put into improving her singing and musicianship.
“I’ve had to work really hard. It definitely didn’t come naturally to me,” Julian said, who practices in her studio apartment — complete with a drum set and recording equipment — daily.
Her friends, most of whom write and make music of their own, recognize Julian’s work ethic and drive to make her music the best it can be.
“She’s really, really talented and very, very dedicated,” said Rani Barlas, a senior majoring in jazz studies. “She spends all her time writing.”
Julian’s dedication goes beyond her musical work ethic and into her personal relationships. Adi described her loyalty as one of her main traits as a friend.
“You could call her at 3 a.m., and she would be there for you,” Barlas said. “She’s really supportive and definitely pushes you to be your best self.”
In the near future, Julian hopes to go back to New York, release new music and go on tour with friends’ bands around the East Coast. She also mentioned being interested in potentially managing artists to help them earn more recognition, too, especially in Los Angeles.
Though a writer in other capacities as well, Julian expressed how she has been particularly drawn to put her words to music.
“I really felt like, ‘Oh, I really really have to do that,’” Julian said. “Once I got the idea, I couldn’t stop thinking about it since then.”
Since the Halsey cover music video, Julian’s peers are excited to hear what projects she has coming up.
“I’m definitely looking out for her next move,” Douglas said.

It’s hard to know where to begin with “Waves.” If you’ve seen the trailer, which mainly consists of pretty images with Frank Ocean songs playing over them, you probably think you already have a sense of what the film is: slice of life, aesthetically pleasing, poignant, very A24. And it is all those things — for the first 15 minutes. Then, everything goes wrong.
This is Trey Edward Shults’ third feature film, coming off the backs of “Krisha,” a fiercely personal, low-budget, critically acclaimed debut and “It Comes at Night,” a quasi-horror film that got mixed reviews. But “Waves” is a departure from both of them. 
You can definitely tell that this is Shults’ work right off the bat. Overall, he does a good job directing the film, utilizing a plethora of simple but effective formal tricks. For example, we’re introduced to the characters early on through a sequence that’s almost a montage, but the cuts are replaced by the camera rotating, traveling from location to location as it turns. It’s the kind of technique implemented in almost any film, regardless of budget, which is interesting. He also plays with the aspect ratio, making the frame smaller to indicate a character’s feelings of entrapment or opening it back up wide to show they feel free.
While Shults is fairly competent as a director in the formal sense, as a writer, he makes some questionable choices. Despite what the trailers lead viewers to think, this is a film that’s more tragic than poignant. Shults bifurcates the structure, so the first half focuses on the tragic spiral of Tyler Williams (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and then the second abruptly switches perspectives to his sister, Emily Williams (Taylor Russell).
This move, although interesting and perhaps even radical, does not work. The first story is a tight spiral downward. It focuses on Tyler’s relationship with his girlfriend Alexis (Alexa Demie) and father (Sterling K. Brown), deftly using those bonds to explore the cyclical nature of toxic masculinity. 
Tyler is a wrestler whose father pushes him to achieve more and work harder to the point that he hides a potentially life-ruining injury from him when he is diagnosed. The climax of the story — which I won’t spoil — involved an anxiety-inducing party scene and the very creative use of Kanye West’s “I Am a God.”
Then we switch to Emily’s story, and that’s where the film starts to become messy. In stark contrast to the narrative tightness of the first half, the film’s second half opens itself up to explorations of vague themes. There are continuous discussions of “peace,” “love” and “forgiveness” without any type of meaningful exploration. Shults completely sidelines the parents of the Williams family, instead introducing a love interest for the daughter played by A24 poster boy Lucas Hedges in what may be his worst performance: an overly-cutesy, self-aware, I’m-awkward-but-so-cute-because-of-it type thing. It’s quite disappointing.
The way the film approaches race is also worth writing about. On one hand, it was definitely marketed as a post-“Moonlight” Black movie, yet the director is white and neglects to meaningfully explore the racial component of the story. That could be for the better since that may not necessarily be his place, but it still feels like a crucial aspect of the narrative and the characters that is not explored.
That’s not to say the film is all bad — the performances all around are great. In particular, Demie has an ethereal screen presence and Brown is fantastic, as well. 
Cinematographer Drew Daniels is also incredible, crafting a film that, at the very least, is incredibly aesthetically pleasing. Each shot of the film has a strong visual style to it. There were even moments when the film would transition into pure abstraction, becoming a soup of warmth, color and sound. The soundtrack, for the most part, is also well done, apart from one questionable and almost comical use of “IFHY” by Tyler, the Creator.
Ultimately, “Waves” is a mixed bag. If you’re a fan of Shults or A24, this may be worth seeing, if only for the pretty songs and beautiful cinematography. But if you’re looking for thematic coherence or a meaningful narrative, this may not be the wave.
