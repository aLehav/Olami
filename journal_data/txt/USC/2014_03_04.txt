The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Saturday, March 1, and Tuesday, March 4. 
Crimes against a person
at 8:27 p.m. on March 3, a non-USC female reported that an EMT pushed her to prevent her from entering an elevator inside the Keck Hospital of USC. The woman did not report the incident at the time it occurred so DPS officers were not able to question the EMT.
at 9:46 p.m. on March 3, a student reported that he was shot twice in the hand with a possible BB gun as he rode his bicycle past a vehicle on Adams Boulevard and Hoover Street. The student said he saw three people in the vehicle but did not see who shot him. The student sustained bruises on the palm of his hand.
Crimes against property
at 11:32 P.m. on March 1, a suspect shattered a garage door window at Alpha Rho Chi by throwing a brick at it.
at 8:49 p.m. on March 2, it was reported to DPS that a student found his bicycle to be missing at the Delta Chi fraternity house. The student watched video surveillance and discovered that another student had taken his bicycle. The student pressed no charges and had his bike returned.
at 12:10 a.m. on March 4, a suspect cut a hole in the convertible top of a vehicle to remove a pair of sunglasses. The vehicle was parked at 3110 Walton Ave.
at 1:44 p.m. on March 4, DPS responded to a student who had injured his ankle while walking down a flight of stairs at the Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center. He was then transported to the Student Health Center for treatment.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 8:36 a.m. on March 3, DPS officers responded to Mardi Gras Apartments to speak with a student at his parents’ request. The parents reported that the student was refusing to submit to medical tests recommended by his doctor. The officers cleared the scene after they were unable to transport the student for the tests.
at 1:59 a.m. on March 4, DPS officers detained a suspect loitering at the intersection of 28th Street and University Avenue. Officers found that the suspect was in possession of a pipe containing possible methamphetamine and a debit card which a student had reported stolen. The suspect was transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.

Officers from the Department of Public Safety opened their weeklong art exhibit, “Beyond the Badge,” in the Galen Center on Tuesday afternoon.

This is the first year DPS has thrown an art show, and it displays work from DPS officers and staff, including paintings, drawings and poetry.
Sergeant Rick Gonzalez came up with the idea about a year ago and approached Elaine Ray, executive assistant to DPS Chief Thomas, about starting the show after Ray had mentioned that she had taken art classes over the years.
“[Sergeant Gonzalez] asked me to help him out and maybe get an art show going, so it’s been about a year and a half, and it was largely his idea,” Ray said.
DPS Chief John Thomas was surprised by the talent shown in the officers’ paintings and its effect on how the officers are viewed by the campus community.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for the university campus community to see DPS officers in a nontraditional light and for them to showcase their talent,” Thomas said.
Ray had several works included in the display, in one of which using skateboards as the canvas and creates a painting that counters around the theme of punk rock.
“I have always been into punk rock and skateboarding, because all my guy friends were skateboarders,” she said.
Her skateboard work displays the band Bad Brains, pioneers of hard core punk, since she thought skateboard and punk rock would go well together. Ray decided to display this part of her childhood in her paintings.
Though she had not painted in 10 years prior to this display, she had the chance to teach in an art class for the DPS cadet program.
“I swear, every kid in that class had some sort of skill, and there were probably about five true, natural artists,” she said.
After seeing the positive effects of art classes on the cadet program, the officers wanted to put together more art classes and expand to areas such as painting and poetry.
Through the art exhibit, DPS is trying to better connect to student life, Ray said. These connections can be made by showing the various interests that these officers have, behind the uniforms and badges.
“It represents [that] we all have our own lives,” she said. “Unless someone really just sat me down and asked me about how I grew up, they wouldn’t know what I was into.”
The exhibition also included poetry, particularly from community service officer Anette Jacobs. Jacobs attended the School of Dramatic Arts at USC.
 One of her poems, “Ancestors in the Wind,” was inspired by her grandmother’s battle with Alzeimer’s disease. A second poem was written on the morning of the memorial service for deceased DPS Officer Keith Lawrence and his fiancee, Monica Quan.
Ray said DPS wants to organize different ways to collaborate with the students, both through crime prevention and through the Greek community. An art show is one of the ways in which the department aims to do this.
“We try to think of ways to create more of a bond, rather than a fight,” Ray said.
After having worked in police enforcement for many years, Thomas says one of the biggest challenges is finding a way to humanize officers.
“In my 30 years in law enforcement, that’s always been one of the challenges, is how do you humanize [the officers] and make people understand that people that choose these professions in police work — they’re humans,” Thomas said.

The Festival of Books will be held April 12 and 13 on the USC campus for the fourth year, taking over theaters, classrooms and outdoor spaces for a variety of panels, signings, performances and demonstrations.
A variety of authors, artists and celebrities are slated to attend the festival, though a schedule will not be announced until March 17, when festival passes go on sale. Individual tickets to events will be available starting April 6.
Many USC faculty members, including Aimee Bender, T.C. Boyle, Josh Kun and Varun Soni, are scheduled to appear. USC student performers include Saved by Grace, SoCal Vocals and the Trojan Marching Band.
Among the authors scheduled to attend are young adult favorites Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green and Veronica Roth; critical darlings Stephen Chbosky and Sandra Cisneros, and actors-turned-novelists B.J. Novak, Alicia Silverstone and Henry Winkler. Daniel Handler, the man behind A Series of Unfortunate Events, is also slated to attend, following his popular appearance last year.
The weekend will begin with the 34th annual L.A. Times Book Prizes ceremony on April 11 in Bovard Auditorium. During the ceremony, John Green will be presented with the 2013 Innovator’s Award and Susan Straight will receive the 2013 Robert Kirsch Award.
Green’s best-selling novels have received numerous awards. The author has been experimenting with social media and technology to expand how people in and out of the literary world use the mediums to inspire and teach. According to the L.A. Times Festival of Books’ website, the Innovator’s Award “spotlights cutting-edge business models, technology or applications of narrative art.”
The Robert Kirsch Award recognizes a body of work by a writer living in or writing about the American West. Straight is a Riverside, Calif. native.

USC World Vision ACT:S and the School of Cinematic Arts co-hosted a screening of The Abduction of Eden with a subsequent panel discussion on Tuesday at the Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre.
Visionaries · (Left to right) Moderator Michelle Lau and panelists iEmpathize Southern California branch coordinator Guido Hajenius, USC international relations lecturer Jessica Peet and screenwriter Richard Phillips Jr. discussed the seriousness of human trafficking and how it should be addressed in the world today. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
Panelists included the screenwriter Richard Phillips, Guido Hajenius, a branch coordinator for the NGO iEmpathize Southern California and Jessica Peet from the School of International Relations. The panel was moderated by Michelle Lau, the co-president and founder of World Vision ACT:S.
The screening, funded by USG, was part of World Vision’s March campaign on human trafficking.
“I came across [The Abduction of Eden] on Netflix, and I was so moved by it that I thought, ‘USC has to see this,’” Lau said. “My Christian faith convicted me to not only learn about the issue more but also to take action and provide concrete steps for students to change this injustice that is happening here in America.”
The film is based on the true story of Korean American Chong Kim, who was kidnapped and forced into prostitution but eventually gained her captors’ trust and escaped.
“I came across a small article about Kim, and I reached out to her, but by the end of our phone call I wasn’t sure if I could go with it because it was so horrific that I thought it would be unfilmable,” said Richard Phillips Jr., the film’s screenwriter. “This is focusing on a domestic issue in America that people would be shocked about, and so I thought it should be told and people should know about it.”
The panelists also discussed their views about human trafficking and the means of addressing it.
“There does have to be a shift from not just prosecuting the exploiter but emphasizing the education of the clients,” Hajenius said. “Truckers think it’s [the girls’] choice and so as we begin to engage them in identifying the situation, it will open their eyes in understanding that there is exploitation behind the rise of child pornagraphy, for instance, instead of villainizing them.”
USC World Vision ACT:S plans to host Empathy Week in Founders Park from March 24-27 as a weeklong campaign to raise awareness and advocacy for human trafficking. There will be three events including the mattress vigil, an art exhibit, a magic show to demonstrate to students how girls are deceived into being trafficked and more. This will be a collaboration with multiple student organizations including USC Korean Campus Ministries, the United Nations Children’s Fund at USC, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment and USC’s United House of Prayer.
“We talk about how modern slavery is not just a criminal issue but it is a cultural issue.” Hajenius said. “The majority of our culture has a heart for this issue but there is a gap between us and the issue. The big step from sympathy to empathy is to enter in the suffering of the victims. Empathy Week is really about empowering and equipping students to not just know about the issue but begin to share these stories.”

At a small gathering of auto enthusiasts in Waite Phillips Hall, Amir Rosenbaum, one of 12 people to break the 400 mph land speed barrier, spoke about his experience building and driving racecars. The event was hosted by the USC Auto Club.
Fast and Furious · Land-speed race record-holder Amir Rosenbaum met with students Tuesday night to discuss his racing career and his experiences in the auto industry in Waite Phillips Hall. – Liliana Scarlet Sedano | Daily Trojan
 
“It’s good to be passionate about something, it makes you a better person,” Rosenbaum said. “But if you’re passionate about cars, that’s even better.”
Rosenbaum’s interest in cars started early; he began making car sounds and saying car names at 9-months-old. He waited until his 16th birthday to get his license, but got his first speeding ticket at noon on the same day.
“At one point, I had 13 speeding tickets in a 37-month period,” Rosenbaum said. “I lost my license. I still drove.”
After holding a series of odd jobs including amateur gold mining, Rosenbaum eventually founded an auto parts company, Spectre Performance, that is now a multimillion-dollar business selling parts to auto enthusiasts.
Rosenbaum began his racing career at the Virginia City Hillclimb in Nevada, a two-lane mountain road where he set the all-time record in 2002 in a Ferrari F-40. He then set his sights on a land speed record, but after realizing he couldn’t do it in the F-40, he decided to build a new car. He ended up using a modified “streamliner,” a 39-foot long vehicle just wide enough to fit the driver, with a 1970 Cadillac big-block engine bought from a junkyard for $100.
“Air behaves differently at supersonic versus subsonic speed,” he said. “Most people think they need to build their car like a jet-fighter, but we decided to stick with the traditional Boeing                               model — more like a raindrop.”
Rosenbaum also spoke about what it was like to drive at over 400 mph and said that at that speed the conscious brain can’t function. Rosenbaum ended up having to rely on a series of LED lights to tell him when to shift gears.
“Some of the older guys told me that I wouldn’t be able to count to four that fast,” he said. “I didn’t believe them, but it’s true; at that speed you can’t count.”
Rosenbaum said that the conscious brain takes in three degrees of the 180 degrees in a normal human field of vision while the subconscious brain handles the rest. He used the example of being able to glance at a text while driving on the highway and not losing control of the vehicle, or how time can sometimes seem to pass more slowly when humans sleep. He said that people should be aware of the power of the subconscious brain and utilize it in their daily lives.
“The job of the conscious brain is to tell the subconscious brain what to do,” he said. “All athletes and other high-performing individuals work this way.”
Students responded to the event enthusiastically and found the anecdotes Rosenbaum shared engaging and informative.
“It’s almost indicative of a different era, how he grew up versus how we grew up,” said John Hu, a junior majoring in economics. “I wonder if we can even do the things that he did.”
Aaron Bajor, president and founder of the USC Auto Club, said it was an honor to host a speaker such as Rosenbaum and said he hoped it would increase awareness about the club, which has grown to almost 200 members.
“USC is a great school, but there aren’t a lot of opportunities for people interested in the automotive field,” said Tyler Makin, a senior majoring in business administration. “It’s great to see those horizons expanding.”
Thanks for the write-up! Awesome event, hope to see more people at events moving forward! Check out our website to learn more about the club

Senior forward Cassie Harberts was named to the All-Pac-12 Team for the second consecutive year on Tuesday, leading four other Women of Troy to receive All-Conference honors ahead of the Pac-12 Tournament on Thursday.
Best of the best · Senior forward Cassie Harberts was named to the All-Pac-12 team yesterday for the second straight season. Harberts averaged 16.2 points per game this season after posting an 18.0 average in 2012-2013. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
Junior guard Ariya Crook earned All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention, junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama and sophomore guard Brianna Barrett made the conference’s All-Defensive Team Honorable Mention and guard Courtney Jaco landed All-Freshman Team Honorable Mention.
In head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s first season at the helm, Harberts was the standout star for the Women of Troy en route to their 18-12 (11-7) record and fifth-place finish in the Pac-12. The four-year starter led the team in points per game (16.2), rebounds per game (7.5), minutes per game (32.9) and blocks (25). She asserted herself as the fulcrum of USC’s offense down low in the post, constantly drawing double-teams and fouls, as she led the team in free throw attempts (214) while converting 57 percent of her tries from the line. Harberts was one of 15 players and seven returnees to be named to the squad.
Harberts tied three others for USC’s program-record 128 appearances in the Women of Troy’s final regular season game, and is poised to claim the record for herself in the team’s Pac-12 Tournament opener against Arizona on Thursday.
If Harberts was the steady star for USC that teams knew they had to stop, Crook was the breakout performer who frequently showed offensive explosiveness to catch opposing defenses off-guard. The Torrance, Calif. native averaged 15.8 points and 2.3 assists per game, often utilizing her quickness to drive to the basket for easy lay-ups. In USC’s biggest win of the season, a 77-70 road upset over then-No. 19 Cal, Crook poured in 34 points, the most scored by a Woman of Troy since 2002.
Both Vaioletama, the only USC player to start all 30 games besides Harberts, and Barrett molded reputations as defensive stoppers this season. Vaioletama led the team in steals (1.9) and defensive rebounds (4.8) per game, while also doubling her offensive output from last season in becoming USC’s third-leading scorer (8.5 ppg).
Barrett, who received All-Defensive Team Honorable Mention for the second straight year, led the team in assists per game (2.8), was second in steals per game (1.4) and fourth in points (6.8 per game).
Jaco established herself as a solid contributer off the bench, averaging 3.8 points per game and nailing 36.1 percent of her three-point attempts while averaging 14.1 minutes.
The selections were culled from a vote of the league’s 12 women’s basketball head coaches.
Stanford forward Chiney Ogwumike won her second straight Pac-12 Player of the Year award, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer was honored with her fourth straight Coach of the Year award and Washington guard Kelsey Plum was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year.

The Trojans will kick off Spring Camp next week with new head coach Steve Sarkisian at the helm, and the new head coach of USC football is already implementing sweeping changes to former head coach Lane Kiffin’s formula. Greg Katz of ESPN spoke on some of these changes in an article published online on March 3.
Sarkisian’s biggest change to spring camp is to open practices to the public. Fans will be permitted to view practices from the top of Dedeaux Field. Kiffin closed his practices off to the public, no doubt due in part to public perception and as a part of his strategy. Kiffin then cited the fact that the majority of college football programs in the nation also close their practices. Regardless, the move was seen as very un-USC.
When I first covered practices for USC last spring, I’ll admit it was pretty exciting to wear my press pass to the practices and feel like an undeserving member of an exclusive contingent (which included a couple folks peeping from the ultra-high bleachers at Cromwell Field) to see the Trojans in action.
What was a bit disappointing, however, was Kiffin’s lack of direct involvement with the players. During practices, Kiffin was a non-interventionist leader, letting his defensive line coach, Orgeron,  and position coaches do all the talking. He was the quiet mastermind, simultaneously standing in the thick of practices while observing from afar.
I’m going to be honest. When I first heard about how former USC head coach Ed Orgeron was getting along with the players following the departure of former coach Lane Kiffin, my first inclination wasn’t to praise Orgeron for his leadership skills. It was to blame Lane Kiffin for creating a culture that seemed to psychologically imprison his players.
If a leader reveals no passion, if a leader does not bare his humanity, his troops will undoubtedly feel emotionally restricted. It almost seemed as if the players were equal parts relieved to be done with Kiffin and overjoyed to buy in to Orgeron’s optimistic, family-like culture. The two coaches, it seemed, were diametrically opposed in their approaches.
The fact that Orgeron received such an overwhelmingly positive response only shows that change was sorely needed. The Trojans delivered in Kiffin’s absence, with an injury-torn roster somehow eking out a 6-2 finish under Orgeron. If the emotionally intense team that vanquished Stanford showed up to the Washington State game, Lane Kiffin might still have his job — but Kiffin could never get that emotion out of his players.
Sarkisian’s decision to open practices shows that his coaching approach is closer to Orgeron’s than Kiffin’s. Though Katz seems to look at the open practice policy from a public relations standpoint, I think it’s important to note that including viewers adds a different element of energy and accountability to practice. In addition to parents and the media, fans and boosters will be present, holding players at least somewhat accountable for their actions. The overall feel gives practices a heightened feel of performance. And why shouldn’t it, at the best film school in the country?
The move to open up practices also invites a different tier of comparison to Sarkisian: the coaching philosophy of Pete Carroll. The former USC head coach and current head coach of the Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks gave a talk at Bovard Auditorium last week emphasizing the importance of creating an open environment.
“Create a vision, and then put together an environment that fosters success and achievement, accomplishment, support and empowerment,” Carroll said. “[I was] really proud to prove that you can do it [at the professional] level.”
By opening practices to the public, Sarkisian is fostering just this sort of environment. Knowing that the public is watching changes the dynamic of any performance — practices included. And then there’s this: the former Washington head coach and USC quarterbacks coach under Carroll received his former head coach’s blessing.
“From early on, I tried to get the administration here to guarantee [Sarkisian] would be the next coach when I was leaving, because I saw it that early in him,” Carroll said. “I’m just thrilled he has this opportunity because he gets it. He knows what ’SC is all about.”
Sarkisian’s decision to open up practices may seem like a step backward for the Trojans when considering the overall college football landscape. Many people might feel that the open practices were what invited NCAA scrutiny in the first place. But the fact is the Trojans have nothing to hide, and Sarkisian wants the lights bright; he wants the public to see what his team is doing. Because to Sarkisian, strategy and sleights of hand take a backseat to performing, competing and giving 100 percent like the world is always watching — and that’s what being a Trojan is all about.

After 36 holes of play ended on Monday, the USC women’s golf team held the lead by five strokes over crosstown rival UCLA at the Bruin Wave Invitational. In yesterday’s final round at El Caballero C.C. in Tarzana, Calif., the Women of Troy continued their strong performance to capture the championship by a total of 13 strokes over No. 15 Pepperdine. Though USC junior Doris Chen did not repeat her stellar 5-under round that she posted during the second round of play, the experience of USC sophomores Kyung Kim and Annie Park, the team’s top two ranked players, proved to be too much for the remaining teams on Tuesday. Head coach Andrea Gaston was ecstatic about the victory.

“I’m really proud of the team for coming back this week and dominating at this course,” Gaston told USC Trojans. “It’s one of the most difficult courses we’ll play all year.”
The Women of Troy finished strong, posting the lowest overall effort of the final round at 2-over par. Erynne Lee of UCLA grabbed a hole-in-one on hole six, but the Bruins struggled to capitalize on Lee’s inspiring shot. In the final standings, Pepperdine finished second after a 7-over par final round, No. 2 UCLA failed to impress with their worst execution of the tournament carding a 20-over par on the final day and No. 10 Arizona rounded out the top four with a 17-over par posted Tuesday. After having lost to UCLA last week in New Orleans, this victory should be a significant boost to the team’s morale. Gaston was clear about the reasons behind her team’s success.
“The key to our win this week was staying patient, especially during the 36-hole day,” she told USCTrojans.com. “It’s easy to have a few tough holes on such a difficult golf course, but we did everything we could to encourage our players to stay in the moment and focus on each shot. That second-round 11-under was incredible.”
Though Park struggled during the first round of play Monday, posting a 5-over 77, her final two rounds were vital to the team’s win. Park, Kim, and Grace Na of Pepperdine each conquered tough final round conditions, finishing with rounds of 69, 73, 71, respectively, on Tuesday. This marked Park’s ninth round in the 60s, setting a school record. She broke the previous record of eight rounds set by two USC women, Jennifer Song in 2010, and Irene Cho in 2006.
Individually, the Women of Troy could not have asked for a better finish to the tournament, as Kim placed first, and Park and Chen finished right behind her in a tie for second. Gaston was impressed with Kim’s consistent performance throughout the tournament.
“I was also excited to see Kyung hang in there down the stretch and get the individual win, along with Doris and Annie tying for second,” Gaston told USC Trojans. “We had little time to prepare, and had to practice between rainstorms, but they got it done.”
Kim echoed her coach’s sentiments.
“I’m very excited for my team to come back and win this week,” she told USC Trojans. “This was a test for me to play well on such a demanding course. I’m happy that I was able to stay patient.”
Senior Sophia Popov also completed the tournament strongly in 13th place, and is the only member of the USC women’s golf team to have not finished outside of the top 20 in any event this season.
With their next round not scheduled until March 24 during the SDSU Farms Invitational in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., the Women of Troy hope to take this momentum with them throughout this long break. One could say the USC women’s golf team deserves this break, however, after notching their sixth win of the season after yesterday’s victory.

After a season that included memorable highs and devastating lows, the USC women’s basketball team heads into the Pac-12 conference tournament in Seattle hoping for one last shot at an NCAA tournament berth. Head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s Women of Troy could sneak into the big dance with a marquee win, possibly over No. 4 Stanford in the third round, but would have to win the entire event to make anything certain. Daily Trojan sports columnists Nick Burton, Jacob Freedman, Euno Lee, Darian Nourian and Sports Editor Will Hanley discussed the team’s first-round matchup against Arizona and its chances going forward.
The “X” factor · Junior guard Alexyz Vaioletama’s 18-point effort carried USC to a 54-45 win over Arizona last month. Vaioletama, who only averages 8.5 points per game, will have to step up in this week’s Pac-12 Tournament. — Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
 
 
Q: How do you think USC matches up against Arizona, its first round opponent?
Burton: USC should blow past Arizona. The Women of Troy looked much better this past weekend (albeit against the lowly Rocky Mountain schools) than in the previous month or so. If they regain their early-season form when they started out 7-1 in conference, they could knock off No. 4-seed ASU in the second round, reaching the magic number of 20 wins.
Hanley: It might be an unpopular opinion, but I am not certain that USC is the matchup nightmare to Arizona that many have claimed. Though some stats from the teams’ January meeting give the impression that the Women of Troy will dominate, I’m not so sure. For one, USC turned the ball over 18 times against the Wildcats in January. They edged out a comfortable win, but Arizona’s ball-hawking guards will once again be a forced to be reckoned with for Cynthia Cooper-Dyke and the Women of Troy. Another disheartening stat from January: senior forward Cassie Harberts only managed eight points, well below her season average. Without an 18 point and 50 percent shooting performance from junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, it’s not out of the question to think USC could have lost that game.
Nourian: The Women of Troy match up really well with Arizona, especially down low and this was apparent the last time the two teams met in Tucson when USC jumped out to a 42-23 second half lead and hung on to prevail 54-45. In this game, USC out-rebounded the Wildcats 44-33. Both forwards Cassie Harberts and Alexyz Vaioletama, who had a game-high 16 points in their last meeting, need to take advantage of their size should the Women of Troy wish to advance. They also need to learn how to hold a lead should they build one early.
 
Q: Which USC players need to step up to help USC advance?
Freedman: Ariya Crook. The Trojans’ long-ball shooter has made less than 33 percent of her shots in seven of her last eight games. That won’t be an issue against Arizona, but USC will need to capitalize against the poor shooting defense of Arizona State (43.7 percent allowed, 11th in the Pac-12) in the quarterfinals if they beat the Wildcats. USC won’t be going to the NCAAs without a win over the Sun Devils, and if Crook has another 4-for-15 performance, the Trojans will be hard-pressed to do so.
Lee: The biggest contribution for the Women of Troy should come from the low post — senior forward Cassie Harberts. Harberts has been dominant in the low post this season, averaging 16.2 points and 7.5 rebounds this season, and junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama will be expected to help anchor frontline scoring to give more opportunities to junior guard Ariya Crook. Crook, who led the Women of Troy in scoring in 13 of 30 games this season, will benefit from a balanced attack and stretch the floor for USC’s other shooters.
Nourian: Well, of course the team is going to need strong performances by their star players in Cassie Harberts and Ariya Crook, but the X-factor will be the one they call ‘X,’ in junior forward Alexyz Vaioletama. ‘X’ has had a breakout year, doubling the output from her sophomore season and, most importantly, she played her two best games of the year against both Arizona teams where she led the team in scoring in both games. It is apparent that ‘X’ has grown and gained more confidence with a little guidance from head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke.
Selbe: Not the most original answer, but the Women of Troy will go as far as senior forward Cassie Harberts will take them. Harberts leads the team in points, rebounds and blocks, and that type of presence down low remains the team’s biggest strength. USC was able to get by the Wildcats without much production from Harberts earlier in the season, and likely will be able to again should she struggle once more. But if the Women of Troy want to make a legitimate run, Harberts will need to be at her best.
 
Q: How far will the Women of Troy make it into this year’s conference tourney?
Burton: Out in the second round to ASU, again just missing the NCAA Tournament. Still a great start for coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke.
Freedman: Semifinals. The Trojans should handle Arizona, and while Arizona State topped USC by eight at Tempe in January, the Lady Sun Devils are coming off an unimpressive sweep up in Oregon. The Trojans should use the confidence from their two-game Rocky Mountain road trip, and sail into the semifinals before falling to Stanford and give the NCAA Selection Committee a tough decision to make come selection time.
Hanley: As clichéd as it is, USC’s performance in this tournament will entirely depend on which USC team shows up to play. Will it be the team that took down Cal on the road to cap a stretch of nine wins in 10 games, or the team that lost six of their next eight? It looks like the team is turning things around, finishing off the season with road wins over Utah and Colorado. I think the team will squeak past Arizona and use the momentum from that big win to overpower Arizona State. Could the Women of Troy upset No. 4 Stanford after that? Judging by USC’s five-point loss in the two squads’ last meeting and the general malaise that accompanies a conference tournament, it’s certainly possible. Still, I don’t see it happening. The National Invitational Tournament is calling.
Nourian: USC has proved that they can play with any team in the Pac-12 at their best, but we have also seen them have letdowns against teams that they should have beaten. I am confident they will beat Arizona, but their second-round matchup against Arizona State is a toss-up. The last time the two teams met, the ranked Sun Devils won at home in overtime. Both teams shot the ball extremely well that game, shooting over 50 percent from the field, but the Women of Troy could have easily won had they made their free throws. They went 9-20 from the stripe while the Sun Devils got to the line 34 times and made 28 of them. I truly believe that USC will win this game to move on to play, unfortunately, the conference’s No. 1-seeded team in No. 4-ranked Stanford, led by Pac-12 Player of the Year Chiney Ogwumike. I think the end of the road in the tournament will come against the Cardinal.

With graduation rapidly approaching, every senior is facing the first big step of living in the real world — getting a job. Though everyone wishes they could pull a Lupita Nyong’o and land the job of a lifetime right before snagging a diploma, sometimes people need a little help.
Save the best for first · Firstjob brings together social media and online recruiters for a painless job searching experience for graduates. – Photo courtesy of Firstjob
FirstJob, an online job search website, is here to help. The website ties together social media presence and online job recruiters to find students the best matches in their job searches. Their site takes into account details on one’s Facebook profile, such as mutual friends and past work experience, to establish connections and appropriate qualifications for entry-level positions in a field of one’s choice.
Sean Little, vice president of marketing for FirstJob and an alumnus of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said that the company has a set goal of finding its users the best jobs or internships possible.
“We’re really passionate about helping current students and recent grads find the best opportunities available,” Little said. “We provide them with all the technology and resources available to make sure their experience is as intuitive and empowering as possible.”
As a member of the Class of ’06, Little feels the pain of many seniors who have yet to find a job. At the time, he felt stuck between checking uninteresting job opportunities on the career center website and searching online job boards, such as Monster and Indeed, the expansive databases that make finding appropriate jobs impossible. He networked through family friends to find job openings.
Thankfully, he eventually found a job at a firm before walking at graduation, but the process was long and arduous.
“One of the biggest hurdles for me was not knowing what type of jobs I may be a good fit for based off my experience or what I felt I was good at. I pretty much had to guess on what would be a good fit based off talking to my friends, parents and career counselors,” Little said. “Even then, advice was contradictory and confusing from each different group.”
The tools that FirstJob offers, however, would have taken the uncertainty out of Little’s job search. Its matching algorithm automatically pairs users to potential employers based on their skill set and experience listed in the “Job” section of one’s Facebook page.
In addition, Company Connect creates professional connections based on one’s list of friends, allowing students to have a more developed professional network in their tool belt come graduation. The website also has a blog that addresses key aspects of a graduate’s job search and helps to “break down important topics and answer pressing questions unique to college graduates and soon to be graduate job seekers,” allowing readers put their best foot forward in the process.
Looking back on this experience with insight from his current job, Little believes that having a website like FirstJob during the process would have alleviated a lot of the stress of finding a good job.
“If I would have had FirstJob at the time, its resources and technology would have helped me speed up the job search process, and be more confident in my choices,” Little said. “I am certain I could have found a better job that allowed me to get started on my current professional path faster with this kind of website.”
Besides those with full-time positions, Little also works with campus ambassadors at different schools nationwide to spread the word on campus about FirstJob. One ambassador is Eric Brunts, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering.
Brunts said he believes that FirstJob is unique because it offers a different way of going about finding a job.
“The website works on a more personal level than various online job boards because it pairs you with a job that is suitable to your experiences,” he said. “As long as you put in the effort to make your profile as complete as it can be, the website will provide tailored results that will better guarantee a good outcome come graduation.”
Though he has only been an intern with the company for a month, Eric believes that his work at FirstJob offers a unique perspective in the job-seeking process that will give him a competitive edge when he is a senior. Little agrees, stating that a big part of his job is to “work with our various campus ambassadors at different schools across the country to help them learn marketing skills that they can apply to the program and carry forward later in their careers.”

I recently had a strange epiphany: There is something about springtime that makes people fall in love as well as get engaged or tie the knot — at least that is what has been happening in my circle of friends.
And quite frankly, it is starting to make me anxious.
First, I spot engagement pictures on Facebook. Then, seemingly all at once, I get the invitations and the thank-you cards in the mail and before I know it, there are pictures posted all over social media of their adorable babies, almost foreshadowing, “Hey — you’re next.”
I might be jumping to conclusions, but it has become apparent that in this day and age, many college kids are meeting both the people they will be with romantically for the rest of their lives and the friends that will be at their weddings.
As for me? Who cares about finding love in a hopeless place — I believe that love will find me in a tasty place.
Apart from all of these engagements and announcements, I cannot help but think of what kind of food the couples will choose to have at their parties — sorry, I’m not sorry.
I love the television shows that completely dramatize how stressful weddings can be, from choosing the cake icing to ensuring that the DJ does not epically ruin the evening with awkward slow jams from the ‘90s and splashes of salsa in the mix. Engaged couples have so many options and also not a whole lot of time to choose. Their food options vary from sit-down dinner to buffet style to little appetizers served throughout the night like tapas, but the pressure to accommodate picky eaters, special diets and the wedding theme or season is evident.
All these factors make choosing food for such events difficult. But all in all, two things remain — love and food. That’s where I come in; after all, I am “In Love With the Edible.”
In my young life, I have been to my fair share of weddings — good, bad and ugly. The bad for me always consists of a bad combination of a lack of food and music. Wedding and engagement parties should celebrate the couple and their future lives together — but what about all of the people who love and support them? They need to eat too. So with that being said, here are a few key tips to having great engagement and wedding receptions, brought to you by some helpful people.
Hire a great caterer
Though Aunt Marge makes great potato salad and barbequed meatballs for the church potluck, that is not what you want  — or your guests expect — for the greatest day of your life. When hiring a great caterer, one often has all the linens, china, silverware, coffee and water service — decorations included. A top-shelf caterer is priceless and their food is outstanding, their service is great and the night becomes memorable not only for you but your guests. If you cut corners on catering, you are not fooling anyone. If budget is a concern, hire a top-shelf caterer and invite fewer guests. If you are doing a buffet-style dinner, make sure your caterer has one line for a buffet table for each 50 guests.
Eat first, then greet your guests 
Instead of forming a receiving line that takes an enormous amount of time to chat with every guest individually, it’s better to get things going. Arrange for a 30 to 60 minute cocktail hour, make your Grand Entrance halfway through, then open the buffet line with your wedding party.
Since you are the first through the line, you will be the first done eating and have a chance to eat in peace, as your guests will be waiting to get in line. Once you are finished with your dinner, walk around and greet your guests one table at a time. This allows you to greet eight to 10 people at once while the event continues to move along at a good pace. By speaking with your guests proactively, they will not feel as inclined to seek you out later for one-on-one interaction. If you have 200 guests and speak with each one for only one minute each, that takes up 3.5 hours of your reception.
Do not make your guests wait 
The time before dinner is very important. We do not want anyone running late, because the guests will be left standing around doing nothing. Make sure your ceremony starts on time and that the photographer does not take longer than the cocktail hour to complete your photos. Your reception doors should open up between 45 minutes and an hour after your cocktail hour begins. If the guests are left waiting much longer than that, they will start to get restless.
Eat, Drink and be Merry 
Your guests will take their cues from you. If you are eating, dancing and enjoying yourself, your guests will too. When I see a packed dance floor, typically the bride and groom are right in the center of the crowd.
We are Trojans — “Win or lose, we still booze!” Therefore, host your wedding appropriately and make sure that beverages are readily available for a good time.

Hundreds, even thousands, of apps are downloaded every day from iTunes, but rarely can one find an app created by two Marshall School of Business graduates. Jon Sutherland and Ted Hadjisavas, who both graduated in 2012, knew when they graduated that they wanted to start their own business.

Upon graduating, however, Sutherland and Hadjisavas both took opportunities to work in the corporate world. After realizing that a spot in the corporate world wasn’t the life for them, they decided it was time to move on and follow their true passion: entrepreneurship. Sutherland and Hadjisavas applied and were ultimately accepted to the Viterbi Startup Garage. Thinking they wanted to create an app, they went forward with an idea, only for it to completely fall apart. Their second attempt was successful and introduced. The app Spruce, aims “to help men discover amazing products.”
But starting the app was not as easy as one might think.
“The startup process is a roller coaster ride,” Sutherland said. “It’s a constant battle to acquire users and learn from them, raise money from investors and work together as a team for 12-16 hours a day while maintaining some level of sanity. In my opinion, having a fantastic startup team that works well together is the most important key to success. When there are only a few employees in a company each person has so much responsibility, and if they don’t deliver the company will fail.”
Every day, Sutherland and Hadjisavas collect products from around the web specifically for men, and then the users of the app decide, by up-voting or down-voting, which products become popular. Usually when an app is downloaded, it takes some time to understand and get acquainted with it. Spruce, on the other hand, is simple. By simply clicking on the trending tab, every product gets split up into a category: cars and vehicles, clothing, gadgets, sports and outdoors or combined all together under the category, “everything.”
From Cole Haan shoes to modern hookahs, there is something for every taste and price range. By inputing the minimum and maximum amount of money to be spent, Spruce finds more than enough options. The app studies the preferences of its users from their likes and dislikes and allows for products to be saved, creating a profile on the user.
“There is no use [for] men spending their money on things they just like and settling, when they can spend their money on something they love,” Sutherland said.
Sutherland said the duo came up with this idea after finding a need for it in their everyday lives.
“Ted and I decided to go shopping at one of our favorite stores, which is Nordstrom, but when we walked inside we realized that as a whole we only like about 5 percent of the products and merchandise,” he said. “So we thought, what if we could make a store where every single product we see is right for us?”
Sutherland and Hadjisavas wasted no time.
“When we came up with Spruce, Ted and I were so excited about it that I just jumped in and started building the first version right away,” he said. “I finished it in about four sleepless days, and we pushed it to the App Store in its raw form. From there, we put it in front of anyone that would listen and gathered feedback. Since then, we’ve gone through a recurring cycle where we gather feedback, improve the product and launch a new version, working toward finding that perfect product-market fit every startup is looking for.”
For even more convenience, Sutherland and Hadjisavas have been putting together complete outfits for purchase. In addition, if one does not wish to purchase the whole outfit, individual pieces can  be bought separately.
Sutherland could not feel more fortunate for the resources USC has given him.
“Words cannot describe how thankful I am for my time at USC,” Sutherland said. “It really shaped me into who I am today. During my time at USC, I jumped around between computer science product design and business — three things I use every day to improve our products and build a young, thriving company.”
Way to go boys, so proud of y’all! Fight On!!
Great job and way to push hard against failure. FiGht ON!

The French are known for their elegance, timeless style and sinful decadence. Not surprisingly, all three traits all characterize French cuisine — especially in their array of desserts. When we consume them, we often do so not only for their individual taste, but so we may feel as if we’re consuming a fraction of French charm as well.
Sweet disposition · French pastry shop Le Mervetty, an affordable and delicious new bakery in Beverly Hills, provides its patrons with unique twists on traditional French dishes made in house. — Photo courtesy of La Mervetty
This European style emanates from every corner of Beverly Hills’ newest pastry shop, Le Mervetty. A pristine white and black color palette compliments the minimalistic design. A miniature Eiffel Tower welcomes customers at the front door, as do employees wearing matching ballerina outfits behind the counter. Everything is clean, minimal, charming and oh-so-French.
Having opened on Valentine’s Day, the shop is fairly new and specializes in the French pastry, merveilleux. Traditionally, merveilleux is made by stacking delicate layers of meringue held together by whipped cream. “Le Mervettys,” as the shop calls them, are cream-filled meringue pastries covered in different shavings. They are proudly displayed behind a glass, looking very much like enticing golden eggs filled with sugar.
Le Mervetty offers five flavors of “Mervettys” to satisfy a variety of taste buds: Speculoos, Nutella, praline, coffee and chocolate. The pastries can be bought in a medium-egg original, Le Mervetty size, a smaller Le Petit Mervetty size or a large Le Grand Mervetty suitable for parties or large get-togethers. The original-size pastries can be bought individually, however — the petite sizes come in boxes of six or 12. It is possible to mix and match certain flavors in the boxes, such as chocolate and Nutella. They also offer “Le Pavlova,” which is a much larger meringue pastry filled with fresh strawberries, vanilla whipped cream and covered with crystallized meringues.
At first glance, you can’t help but marvel at the intricacy of the design of the “Mervettys.” They sit atop small silver goblets, each one looking more time-consuming to make than the next. They are perfectly egg-shaped and the originals are a tad smaller than a cupcake. If you order out, a tutu-clad server puts the petites in their own see-through box while the originals are placed in a larger closed box with the store’s signature ballerina logo on the side. The admiration of the Mervetty’s artwork and the way they are presented almost makes you not want to eat them and defile something so seemingly pure. Almost.

Eating a Mervetty is an experience all in its own. The first bite introduces you to whatever shaving was on that particular pastry and the special whip cream. Then, in comes the cream filling that is significantly less sweet than the first layer, with only hints of the flavor it is meant to have. A sweet and airy meringue layer awaits you at the very bottom. If you eat the meringue first, the sweetness is overwhelming and reminiscent of having a spoonful of pure sugar in your mouth. While if you only eat the top layer, the filling may seem too bland. This is a dish that shouldn’t be picked at or taken apart, but rather enjoyed in its entirety.
The staff makes many of the ingredients in their kitchen, which gives them the freedom to manipulate an item’s flavor to suit the individual Mervetty. The flavors, however, sometimes fell short of expectations. The customer favorite is the Nutella Mervetty. The pastry is not filled with Nutella, but rather topped with a small dollop of Nutella whipped cream. Coming from a Nutella enthusiast,  it was a moderate disappointment. The chocolate Mervetty was much more true to its name and tasted like a fine ball of milk and dark chocolate. This one was covered in Belgian dark chocolate flakes, giving the chocolate whipped cream a nice contrast. The praline Mervetty was just the right amount of sweet and nutty, with hazelnut whipped cream covered with caramelized praline feuilletine flakes. The undeniable winner of the four, however, was the coffee Mervetty. The aroma of coffee radiated from the pastry before it was even touched. It was almost as if you were eating a mocha latte, in the best way possible. The taste was not overpowering and could have been even stronger. When compared to the other three, the coffee Mervetty had a much richer flavor throughout and surpassed all expectations.
For those who would like to venture into Beverly Hills and experience a piece of French delicacy, Le Mervetty is surprisingly budget-friendly. Pastry prices start at $2.50, and range up to $60 for a dozen Mervettys. The shop is conveniently open Monday-Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
This is more of a grab-and-go place than a sit-down café, since the only seating available is a small white bench against the wall. Still, it is always worth a trip to any place that has ballerinas serving freshly made meringue. How much classier does it  get?

On Saturday, the soccer world’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, announced its decision to allow both male and female soccer players to wear religious head covers during their matches, according to CNN. Previously, the wearing of head garments was banned by FIFA, citing the potential risk of injury to the head or neck. This ruling, however, exemplifies FIFA taking a step in the right direction for recognizing the need for religious tolerance in all arenas, sports or otherwise.
“It was decided that female players can cover their heads to play,” said FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke in a statement, according to Haaretz.
The decision, announced to the International Football Association Board in Zurich, came after the expiration of a successful two-year trial period allowing headscarves.
But it hasn’t always been this way. In 2007, FIFA banned headscarves as a safety precaution. As a result, the Iranian women’s soccer team withdrew from its 2011 Olympic qualification match against Jordan in protest.
More relaxation of headdress rules came in July 2013 after a Canadian Sikh community lobbied FIFA to allow turbans to be worn on the soccer field.
Though the decision to allow athletes to observe their own religious practices wouldn’t logically seem to affect the game, past events have suggested otherwise. In a 2010 soccer match, Hapoel Tel Aviv’s Itay Schechter was controversially given a yellow card for celebrating a goal by donning a kippah, a small head cap traditionally worn by observers of the Jewish faith. Though the act of wearing the kippah didn’t have any effect on the game, the decision to punish the player set the unusual precedent that religion is not welcome on the field.
Achieving religious tolerance within society has been a global goal for centuries, and yet such a goal has not been fully realized. The suspension of the ban on religious garments, however, brings society one step closer to allowing freedom of religious expression in one facet of society — sports.
Not permitting athletes to follow their passions simply because they choose to abide by their religious teachings or punishing players for observing religious forms of expression that in no way distract from the game is not only unjust, but it’s also a violation of their right to religious expression. As little importance as a yellow card might seem in the grand scheme of things, the fact that someone was penalized in any way for displaying a piece of his religion is wrong.
In the 1965 World Series, Jewish pitcher Sandy Koufax didn’t pitch in Game 1 in observance of the Jewish High Holiday of Yom Kippur. In Feb. 1995, Houston Rockets’ center Hakeem Olajuwon averaged 29 points per game and was named National Basketball Association Player of the Month, all the while observing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Religion and sports have enjoyed peaceful coexistence in American professional sports, and FIFA’s decision reinforces this on a global scale. By giving athletes the freedom to express their religious practices, FIFA’s decision further allows players and their supporters’ to showcase their pride in their religious identities.
After protests and dissent, FIFA realized that there was no reason to have such restrictions, and adhered to the needs of sports players around the globe. Though FIFA has taken strides toward the advancement of religious freedom, there is still a lot of work to be done across nations to maintain the necessity for expression of any religion, no matter the place or time.

As someone who just finished her teenage years, I can attest to the fact that I, along with the majority of teenagers, often use clothes to make a statement. The same is true of a handful of northern California students who wore U.S.  flag shirts to school to make a statement in 2010 on Cinco de Mayo, according to the Los Angeles Times. After school administrators ordered the students to turn their shirts inside-out, however, the students’ statement spread nationwide and sparked a debate on constitutional rights in school and the limitations on conversation between students of different backgrounds.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
On Feb. 27, a federal court upheld an earlier court decision that school administrators did not violate the students’ rights when they asked them to turn their shirts inside-out or go home, according to Fox News. Yet the court’s confirmation does not adequately address and touch upon the most pressing problems of the students’ statement and the situation as a whole.
Because the group of Live Oak High School students wore shirts with the country’s flag on Cinco de Mayo, administrators believed it would lead to controversy. They claimed that because there was a history of racial tension between white and Latino students in the school — particularly on Cinco de Mayo — there was also a strong possibility that Latino students would perceive the wearing of the American flag as an insult. Therefore, the teachers argued that they were not stifling the students’ right to free speech, but instead securing their safety.
Yet this calculated assumption and subsequent policy immediately limits any productive conversation that could have taken place surrounding the incident. Instead of hiding the seemingly problematic T-shirts, a constructive conversation should have been held instead. Every constructive conversation must take place in a safe environment, which the administrators had — the school.
Public schools are instruments of states. For this reason, public schools are an opportunity to bring students of diverse and disparate backgrounds together to learn, listen and communicate with one another. Because it brings together young minds that are still developing and learning the ways of the world, it is an ideal space to expose those budding citizens to all camps of thought and personalities. Therefore, when school administrators asked students to remove or hide the flag on their T-shirts, it went against one of the basic tenets of education: conversation on diversity.
Federal courts have dealt with the issue of students’ rights to freedom of speech many times in the past 50 years. Court rulings such as Tinker v. Des Moines in 1969, in which students were told to remove black armbands protesting the Vietnam War, and Morse v. Frederick in 2007, during which a student revealed a sign during a school-sanctioned event that promoted illegal drug use, have shown that in some instances students are afforded the right to express their opinions and in others they are barred from doing so due to overarching school policies. Though the judge’s ruling on the incident at Live Oak High School said the administrators’ need to protect the safety of students outweighed the students’ freedom of expression, the officials’ responsibility to facilitate meaningful conversation surrounding the racial tension and patriotism should have also been a top priority.
In high school, communication between students is key. Particularly in our ever-evolving melting pot of a country, forcing people to hide their statements will not continue to move the country forward. Instead, open dialogue — even if it is contentious and controversial — is critical to bringing everyone’s point of view to the surface.
By allowing everyone to express their beliefs and thoughts, school administrators can encourage students to continue maturing into responsible citizens who are able to connect with all people. At the end of the day, that is the ultimate result we can ask to come out of our public school system.

Okay I understand the point made about meaningful dialogue but how do you propose they do that since all you say that they should have it? Does the VP go up the kids in the American flag shirts or the kids celebrating cinco de mayo? Dialogue about race and culture and sex and all the other controversial/sensitive topics should happen at the high school level and I would like to see you expand on how to actually do it.
Why would wearing a United States flag be a sign of disrespect to any individual that chooses to live in the United States? It is twisted that rather then make a clear message that violence will not be tolerated, the administration chose to “protect” the victims by silencing them and making the potential victims change their behavior rather then confront and deal with potential thugs that use the threat of violence to silence people. I guess these administrators would also “protect” rape victims by telling them to dress up in loose, unflattering clothes.

To kick off the 2014 MLB season, we will be going around the diamond to find out who are the best under-the-radar players to look out for while you’re planning for your fantasy drafts. For the first edition of the series, we’ll start with the cornerstones of your team, the first and third basemen, or the corner infielders.
First Basemen
My initial thought, in terms of draft strategy for this year, was to funnel a lot of money into the best players while disregarding positional scarcity, because the top talent this year seems to be annually underappreciated (I’m looking at you, Chris Davis and Edwin Encarnacion). However, the more I look at the 1B list, the more talented sleepers I find, leaving more money/high draft picks to be saved for the 2B and SS of the world.
1) Jose Abreu, Chicago White Sox
Jose Abreu, recently rescued from Cuba for the price of $68 million over four years, is teeming with power potential. Labeled as possibly the best player in the world by some of his old Cuban teammates and MLB sensation Yasiel Puig, Abreu remains low key because Puig has already claimed the title “the Great Cuban Hope.” Although the thought that Adam Dunn might be mentoring Abreu is scary, he should at least have the power to smack 30-35 home runs, a valuable commodity in rotisserie leagues. A player with this kind of potential who is valued as the 19th best 1B in the ESPN rankings is well worth taking a flier on.
2) Mark Teixeira, New York Yankees
The Yankees first baseman is coming off a season where he received 53 at-bats, with a whopping eight hits out of those at bats. However, even as he was working off the rust from a major injury, he still managed to homer in three of those eight at bats. If you extrapolate those numbers over the course of a full season (assuming he stays healthy for a full season), that’s about 30-35 home runs for a guy who strikes out under 120 times a season. Considering he’s hitting in the heart of a revamped, OBP-centric lineup and playing his first full season in that new sandbox we call Yankee Stadium, let’s just say I like his odds.
3) Justin Morneau, Colorado Rockies
If, for some reason, you get tricked into drafting Hee-Siop Choi, forget he hasn’t been in baseball for 8 years, and only have a dollar or a late round pick to spend on an actual first baseman, don’t worry, because former MVP Justin Morneau will be available. And this should make you ecstatic, because who is talking about Justin Morneau these days? The 29th-ranked first baseman lost relevance lollygagging in the Twins’ organization before getting a very slight boost after a post-deadline trade to the Pirates last year. However, he made no headlines when he signed with the Rockies this winter. But I’ll take a guy who takes his 17 homers, .323 OBP, and 77 RBI with two mediocre hitting teams in spacious parks to one of the most potent lineups in baseball at the best hitting ballpark in recent memory.
Third Basemen
Third base just never gets any better. You have the perennial guys at the top in Cabrera, Beltre, Longoria and Wright, but you’re left hoping a second half breakout Chase Headley happens if you miss out on those guys. Luckily, we can add one more name to the top 4 in Matt Carpenter. But, with a typical five more teams in a league in need of a third baseman, let’s look at some of the other options you’ll have if you miss out on these five.
1) Will Middlebrooks, Boston Red Sox
Middlebrooks has received a lot of draft hype, and most of it, deservedly so. His draft prospects are a little inflated because of the dearth of quality at this corner spot, but there are things to like about the Greenville, Texas product. He was a revelation in 2012, and started off hot in 2013, but all of a sudden, his production fell off a cliff. Fortunately for him and his fans, he picked it up with an impressive 881 OPS in August, and followed that up with a very respectable 747 OPS in September. Good late season showings are a very good indicator of future success and if Middlebrooks, who is still very young, can sustain this and improve on his skills, he can definitely finish in the top 5 of third basemen at season’s end, when Longoria eventually injures himself for the rest of the year.
2) Mike Moustakas, Kansas City Royals
Middlebrooks is the only real third baseman sleeper I have for this year. No one else is really going to outdo their production from this crop of 3Bs, though I do have some hope for Moustakas. However, this is mostly predicated on my sixth sense of “this guy has to break out at SOME point, right?” Moustakas was a high draft pick and a top prospect for a minor league system that was littered with good players. Some guys just develop slowly. Even though I have no concrete reason why, this could be the year Moustakas takes off.
3) The Matts: Matt Davidson, Chicago White Sox and Matt Dominguez, Houston Astros
Although both Davidson and Dominguez are a couple years too early from breaking out into 10-team, mixed league fantasy relevance, there’s no one with better potential than the Matts. Davidson will be a rookie this year, but with a 20-25 home run potential and hitting in shallow U.S. Cellular Field with a pretty decent White Sox lineup around him, he could put up decent numbers if he’s not overpowered by major league pitching. Dominguez was one of the lone bright spots for the lowly Astros last year, but proved that he can hit in the big leagues. He, too, is about a year away from taking the next big step and possibly becoming a major player at the third base spot, though there’s no reason why can’t take that step this year. The problem is that there’s also no reason why he would take it this year.
