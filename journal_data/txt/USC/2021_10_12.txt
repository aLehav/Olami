Women’s volleyball defeated No. 24 Colorado 3-1 Sunday at the Galen Center. This was USC’s first win against a ranked opponent this season. The final score was 25-19, 27-25, 20-25, 25-23 in favor of the Trojans. Before the victory Sunday, the Trojans suffered back-to-back losses against No. 15 Washington and No. 13 Utah last week. USC now sits at 7-8 overall and 3-3 in conference matchups. Here’s a rundown of the team’s status as it continues Pac-12 play. 
Impact Players
Graduate students middle blocker Candice Denny and outside hitter Shannon Scully were the game’s two heroes against Colorado. The two tallied 15 kills and 2 aces on Sunday. Denny also had three blocks and Scully had one. Graduate student outside hitter Brooke Botkin and junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske also contributed with 11 kills and 2 aces each.
Stat Leaders
So far this season, senior setter and team captain Raquel Lazaro leads the team with 440 assists and 21 service aces. Denny has the most blocks on the team with 41, followed by Weske who has 35. Scully has tallied the most digs with 192. Botkin leads with 231 kills, which is 101 more than Emilia Weske’s second-place total of 130.
In Comparison to Last Season
Right now, USC’s record is exactly what it was at the end of the 2020 season. The team already tied the amount of games that it won last year, but that is because of a shortened schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Trojans also beat Colorado last season, doing so twice in a row to finish the 2020 season.
Next Up — Arizona State
The Trojans will travel to the state of Arizona for back-to-back away games against Arizona State and Arizona. The Sun Devils have had a similar season to the Trojans, sitting at 8-9 overall. However, their conference record is only 1-5, and they have lost six of their last seven games. The only Pac-12 opponent Arizona State has defeated is UC Berkeley.
Junior outside hitter Iman Isanovic has shined for the Sun Devils so far this season and leads the team in kills with 261. Last season, Isanovic was an All Pac-12 Honorable Mention. Both of USC’s games against Arizona State last year were canceled, so the Trojans haven’t played the Sun Devils since 2019, when they won 3-2 in Tempe. 
Next Up — Arizona
Arizona is a solid team that boasts an 11-6 record, but it is in the midst of a three-game losing streak. The Wildcats currently sit at 3-3 in conference play. Outside hitter Jaelyn Hodge is having a breakout season and leads Arizona with 206 kills, passing her total of 176 last season. Last season, USC defeated the Wildcats 3-2.

The NFL is back, and it has been great. The MLB playoffs have been must-see television, and shouldn’t be overshadowed by America’s New Pastime. After an electric end to the regular season, in which the Giants held their ground as the Dodgers unsuccessfully battled for first place in the National League West, the postseason brings even more drama. Plenty of eyes are on the series between the Giants and Dodgers, featuring the MLB’s best two teams this season, but the other three matchups have already proved to be competitive and entertaining enough to pay attention to.
In the battle for a spot in the American League Championship Series, the Tampa Bay Rays have met their match against the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox, who finished last place in the A.L. East in 2020, have battled to win the series 3-1. The Red Sox solidified their spot in the playoffs with a 6-2 victory over the New York Yankees in the A.L. Wild Card game. Kyle Schwarber, who was traded from the Washington Nationals during the season, proved his worth as he hit an early home run on the struggling Yankee ace pitcher Gerrit Cole. 
After the Rays took game one convincingly, the Red Sox responded by recording 20 hits en route to a 14-6 victory. Their ability to get on base and strong hitting performances from shortstop Xander Bogaerts, outfielder Alex Verdugo and third baseman Rafael Devers proved to be too much for the Rays. 
While the first two games of the series were filled with excitement, Game 3 was a showstopper. A 5-hour game that lasted a whopping 13 innings, the third installment of this match up provided the most controversial play of the postseason thus far. 
After a line drive hit from Tampa Bay center fielder Kevin Kiermaier hit the back wall, bounced off of Red Sox outfielder Hunter Renfroe and landed back out of the field of play, the Rays were awarded an automatic double. However, the Rays had a man on base who, if the ball stayed in the field of play, likely would have scored the go-ahead run in the top of the 13th inning. The MLB rulebook struck again, and Red Sox’s catcher Christian Vazquez walked it off in the 13th. It was an incredibly flukey play, and Rays fans have every right to be upset over the outcome.
The Red Sox, who finished last in their division in 2020, are in a prime position to take over the A.L. If they continue riding the momentum won in the Wild Card game, they could be the team to beat in the A.L. However, pitcher Chris Sale will need to improve from his previous start. The Red Sox star who returned from injury this year let up 5 runs in the only inning he pitched. The Red Sox certainly have potential to advance to the World Series, but potentially facing the Houston Astros will be a tall task. 
The Astros are a complete team and are making their way to the A.L. Championship Series. With second baseman Jose Altuve and outfielder Yordan Alvarez combining for 64 home runs and pitcher Lance McCullers Jr.’s pattern of excellent starts, the Astros are the heavy favorite to win the A.L. They proved why in their first game against the Chicago White Sox, embarrassing Chicago’s starting pitcher Lance Lynn, who allowed 5 runs in 3.2 innings pitched. The White Sox’s pitching woes continued in Game 2, as the Astros got on base 16 times, and won the game 9-4. 
Game 3, like the Rays-Red Sox series, was by far the most exciting. The White Sox hit the ball extremely well and didn’t leave many men on base, earning 12 runs for their 16 hits. Both pitcher Luis Garcia and reliever Yimi Garcia) posted double-digit ERAs as the Astros dropped their first game of the postseason. The Astros will move past the White Sox and into the ALCS, where they will utilize their bullpen, perhaps the best out of the remaining teams, to reach the World Series.  
The series between the Braves and Brewers, despite low scoring, still remains intensely competitive, with the Brewers taking Game 1 by a score of 2-1 due to an excellent performance by pitcher Corbin Burnes. However, thanks to a shutout from Braves pitcher Max Fried, the Braves took Game 2. Fried pitched 6 innings and struck out 9 batters without allowing a single run or walk. The Braves took the series lead in Game 3 in another low-scoring match up. A 402-foot home run from outfielder Joc Pederson brought in the only runs scored in the game as Atlanta defeated Milwaukee 3-0. 
Atlanta is getting hot at the right time, looking to play spoiler to the winner of the Dodgers-Giants series. With a solid bullpen and a strong offense, they could steal a game or two from either of the NL West squads. However, the Dodgers are built for the postseason in a way that few teams can compare. Led by pitchers Walker Buehler and Max Scherzer, they have an elite lineup of starting pitchers. No matter who comes out of the Braves-Brewers series, the Dodgers or Giants should handle them with relative ease and earn a spot in the World Series. 
There have already been so many fantastic games, and there are only a few short weeks until we have to say goodbye to baseball for now. So, if you are ever bored in class or looking for a reason to put off studying for your midterms, throw on some baseball and enjoy this fantastic postseason.

It seemed like it was going to happen. No. 1 men’s water polo was primed to make a comeback Saturday against No. 5 UC Berkeley. The Bears led for most of the fourth quarter, but their offense stalled and senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt had just completed a hat trick to bring the Trojans within one score, 7-6.
With 37 seconds left on the scoreboard and possession of the ball, Head Coach Marko Pintaric called out an unusual formation, bunching three players on the right side of the pool. The designated play drew an exclusion, and as the clock winded down, the Trojans got the ball into the hands of redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep. USC’s fifth all-time leading scorer pulled back and unleashed a laser in front of goal — the picturesque game-tying goal at the buzzer. But a Bears defender deflected Mercep’s attempt, and Berkeley handed USC its first loss this season.
“Our plan was to create mismatches and … put [our] best players in the best position where they feel most comfortable,” Pintaric said. “In the last play, I know it looked a little messy, but at the end, our shooters were in a position to score.”
USC fell to 12-1 in a gritty game that was a defensive battle from the first possession. Instead of their usual suffocating man press, the Trojans dropped into a zone to deal with Berkeley’s center Nikolaos Papanikolaou. It worked — the 2020 MPSF Player of the Year went scoreless — but it opened the pool for other Bear attackers. Senior Nic Porter was called into action early and often, saving three shots in two back-to-back possessions in the first quarter. 
“Our scramble defense to shut down their last second opportunities really showed a lot of heart and a lot of character from our team,” Porter said. “But, a loss is a loss. It feels like those things don’t really matter after the result, but we’ll take positives from this game, and we’ll move forward.”
The Bears also committed to taking away center forward opportunities. Berkeley was content with sitting back and allowing USC long shots. This strategy paid off, as the Trojans shot 16.2% on 37 shots.
With both defenses locked in, powerplays were the only reliable way to score. Berkeley was an efficient 4 for 7, while USC struggled with only 2 scores on 14 exclusions.
“From the bench, there were a couple point blank opportunities that we passed, that we didn’t want to take,” Pintaric said. “We were holding the ball a little too long. That ball, on 6-on-5, needs to move a little quicker to open up the holes, and we missed some really easy opportunities.”
USC quickly bounced back Sunday in a 17-8 away win against No. 12 UC Irvine. Redshirt freshman goalie Blake Jackson got the starting nod and did enough, saving half of the shots the Anteaters had on target, while junior driver Marcus Longton came up with five steals.
Offensively, USC looked like its normal self. This time out, the Trojans went 7 for 13 on powerplays, including three from Mercep. Mercep finished with five goals and Ehrhardt doled out three assists. 
USC will face another test next week when it visits No. 7 Long Beach State. LBSU only concedes 6.6 goals a game, so the Trojans will look to work out the wrinkles in their offense in time for Sunday’s game, which started at noon.

Women’s soccer registered its tenth win in a row Sunday in a comfortable 7-0 victory over Utah, matching USC’s program record for consecutive victories. The bout maintained USC’s position at the top of the Pac-12 conference standings, keeping the Trojans three points in front of second-place Washington State and third-place Stanford. 
Utah proved a competitive opponent in the opening 30 minutes, as the match remained scoreless despite a few attempts from the Trojans. In the 37th minute, freshman forward Simone Jackson provided a through pass for sophomore defender Zoe Burns, who converted her first goal of the season and second of her USC career. 
Nearly six minutes later, Jackson lobbed a cross to freshman midfielder Helena Sampaio, who headed the ball in the net, scoring the first collegiate goal of her career. Jackson provided her second assist of the game and proved a difference maker off the bench. 
“I thought Simone [Jackson] was great,” said Head Coach Keidane McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “She got the chance to see what the team was doing and buy in to make the corrections we wanted to make. When she came in she executed really well playing out of the flank.”
USC continued running rampant after halftime, scoring the first of five second-half goals in the 57th minute, when junior midfielder Croix Bethune sprinted past a few Utah players before sending a through pass to redshirt senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo, who scored her third of the season. Two minutes later, Bethune received a pass from Burns in the penalty box before turning and passing to junior forward Hannah White for the fourth goal of the match as White went around a defender and converted her third of the season. 
In the 62nd minute, sophomore midfielder Jaelyn Eisenhart raced across the left flank and passed to senior forward Penelope Hocking for the fifth and Hocking’s 50th goal of her collegiate career, adding on to her newly-set scoring record at USC. 
Following a Utah own-goal in the 83rd minute, freshman defender Izzy Kimberly collected a failed clearance in the 87th minute to score the seventh in the victory. The match’s scoreline marks the highest-scoring game in USC’s Pac-12 season so far. 
Despite the scoreline, Utah’s strategy of playing from the backline proved to be an obstacle to USC in the opening minutes, with the Trojans eventually finding their first goal in the 37th minute. 
“I thought the carry over from [Thursday’s Colorado game], defensively from the front group, was fantastic,” McAlpine said. “And that commitment from that front group to defend and defend for the group makes all the difference in making the game predictable for that back core group of players.”
The result was Utah’s biggest loss of the season since a 3-0 loss at Stanford.
“The most important part of that scoreline is the 0,” McAlpine said. “That’s the one we really love to see [and] want to have every time we step out on the park. But to get this many people on the scoreboard … only makes the team better. The energy of this team is good.”
USC will hit the road and face Oregon, who is 3-1-1 in conference play and fifth in Pac-12 standings. Kickoff will be at 4 p.m. Thursday.

What an autumn it has been for the music industry. Whether it be the popularity contest between Kanye West and Drake or the increasingly virality of smaller artists due to TikTok, several old and new musicians have made their mark on the industry — just in time for Grammy nominations on Nov. 23. Fall 2021 has marked the music creation’s continuation during a time where touring, festivals and other in-person activities remain uncertain. 
Newly Released Music
Some of the biggest drops in music took place during the past few weeks. Artists showed range, fusing elements of country, pop, rhythm & blues and hip hop. Without further ado, here are some recent releases that you should be streaming. 
Meek Mill – “Expensive Pain” 
Released on Oct. 1, Meek Mill excited audiences with his fifth album, “Expensive Pain.” The long awaited 18-track album release contains a featured artist on nearly every song. Guests on Mill’s album include A$AP Ferg, Kehlani, Lil Uzi Vert and Young Thug, just to name a few. Although the album was released less than a week ago, several of his songs are charting on Apple Music and Billboard.
Kacey Musgraves – “Star Crossed” 
Although “Star Crossed” marks Musgrave’s fifth studio album, the country star has made an impression on both television and TikTok. Although it was released on Sept. 10, Musgrave’s song “breadwinner” is currently trending on TikTok. She also had “Saturday Night Live’s” first-ever nude performance last weekend. 
Musgraves’ album is much more than its social media popularity, however. The album effectively serves as a breakup record, touching on Musgraves’ recent divorce from Ruston Kelly — her husband of three years. It’s the perfect album to stream after a summer spent sobbing to Olivia Rodrigo.
Drake – “Certified Lover Boy”
While we all have heard “Way 2 Sexy” a few too many times this fall, Drake’s latest album, “Certified Lover Boy” remains ranked second on the Billboard charts.  Shuffle through the hitmaker’s newest album with an album filled with tunes about love and women that details the “life of a lover boy,” a reference to Drake’s caricature in popular culture. In particular, “Way 2 Sexy” might be the way to go if you need a little hype up. If not, try a pop hit such as “Stay” or the fun country bop “Fancy Like.”
Upcoming releases 
In terms of new music set to release this month, there should be no shortage. Whether you love to pay homage to old country hits, high-energy rap, alternative pop, or soul pop funk, there is something for everyone.
Remi Wolf – “Juno” 
Alternative pop queen Remi Wolf’s debut album “Juno” is set to release Oct. 15. The album was created during a time where many changes were happening in Wolf’s life according to her recent interview with “Pitchfork.”
 “[The album] really reflects the feelings of tension and release that these changes provoked in me,” Wolf said on her website.
Being college students, we are all familiar with these tense and turbulent emotions. Hopefully, this album will be able to give everyone some release. 
Taylor Swift – “Red (Taylor’s Version)”
Most importantly (objectively speaking, of course) is the planned release of “Red (Taylor’s Version),” set to release on Nov. 12. Despite the songs being released nearly nine years ago, the bops, screaming of love, heartbreak and growing up, will be sure to get you in your holiday feels — this time with the added vocal depth and maturity of Taylor’s Version. 
Young Thug – “Punk” 
Young Thug’s second studio album, “Punk,” is set to be released Oct. 15, inspired by his life situations and the people that surround him. From spoken word poems to traditional rap, he will share emotions, reflect on his life and provide racial commentary in his highly anticipated album.

Recently, there have been a few films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that have provided representation for several groups who often are ignored by Hollywood, especially larger franchises. “Captain Marvel” (2019) proudly became the first MCU film to feature a woman as its main protagonist. The marketing for “Black Panther” (2018) was also very much centered around being a Black superhero movie, intertwining itself with Black identity through costume design and soundtrack production created by Black artists. “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” (2021) had a similar approach, with much of the film’s marketing and plot focused on the main character’s Asian ethnicity. 
Marvel allowing these films to be celebrations for a certain identity truly is a wonderful way to make the representation meaningful. However, the MCU, while doing its best to be representative of our world as a whole, has skimped on Latinx representation. The very few characters who have shown up are unlikely to have their own feature length film; although everyone would enjoy a Michael Peña Luis trilogy, it’s not going to happen. So in honor of Latinx Heritage Month, let’s take a look at which Marvel comic book characters could join the MCU as its first Latinx lead.
Miles Morales
Miles Morales, aka Ultimate Spider-Man, is an Afro-Latinx 13-year-old from Brooklyn, New York on Earth 1610. He is bitten by a radioactive spider and subsequently given powers similar to the original Spider-Man, with the addition of camouflage, stun blasts and superhuman strength and agility. In his universe, Peter Parker is killed, and Morales must take up the burden of taking up the mantle of Spider-Man.
Miles’ ability as a main character in a live-action film in the MCU is an enticing prospect. Firstly, the Miles Morales character has become immensely popular because of the animated film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (2018), as well as the video game “Spider-Man” (2018), where he was a featured character. 
Miles, as a Black character, also represents a section of the Latinx population all too often ignored, and his character shows audiences Black and Latinx are not mutually exclusive.
The only negative to a Miles Morales feature MCU film is Marvel’s deal with Sony. What is and isn’t permitted between the two studios is not well known. However, it would not be surprising if Miles Morales was off-limits considering the character’s success in recent years. This seems even less likely when considering “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2” is scheduled to release next year. It’s not impossible, though, and audiences everywhere can dream about seeing the young web slinger on the big screen soon.
Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O’Hara)
If Sony won’t allow Marvel to use Morales, maybe it would allow the use of a minor character from that same story. Miguel O’Hara was born on Earth-928, several decades in the future and well after the heyday of the original Spider-Man. Miguel received his spider powers when he merged his DNA with a spider after his bosses at the corporation Alchemax tried to kill him. 
Miguel’s Mexican heritage from his mother’s side is more present in the comics than his half-Irish side. Using Spider-Man 2099 could be a stroke of genius for Marvel, creating a film with a Latinx lead while also introducing mainstream audiences to an aspect of the Marvel universe not yet explored. Marvel has not been afraid to go out on a limb and make movies about the weirder aspects of the comic book canon, “Guardians of the Galaxy” (2014), “Thor: Ragnarok” (2017) and even “Shang-Chi” (2021) all serve as examples of this. With the next few movies setting up the multiverse, there is very clearly a bridge to Miguel’s version of Earth. A movie with Miguel fighting futuristic or robotic versions of well-known superheroes sounds like an incredible cinematic experience. 
Falcon (Joaquin Torres)
Marvel could also look to an already established character in its canon if they wanted to have a lead for their first Latinx film. Joaquin Torres shows up in “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” (2021) as an Airforce operative and a friend of Sam Wilson. By the end of the show, Sam relinquishes his identity as Falcon and becomes Captain America. While the show does not mention who will take up the mantle of Falcon, in the comics, where Joaquin Torres becomes Falcon after Sam Wilson becomes the new Captain America, offers some insight. 
Joaquin Torres was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States with his mother and grandmother when he was six years old. His appreciation for the Mexican American community, especially Mexican immigrants, played a key part in his character. His origin story is actually tied to stopping violence towards Latinx immigrants trying to cross the border, as the evil corporation Malus was kidnapping and experimenting on them. A film featuring Torres as the lead  and including themes of immigration and discrimination would be an incredible example of representation by Marvel. They already have the character set up, all they need to do is pull the trigger.
Nova (Sam Alexander)
Sam Alexander is a 13-year-old living in Arizona with his mother, who is of undetermined Latinx descent, and his father, who is a miserable drunk. After his father goes missing, Sam finds a mysterious black helmet that gives him superhuman abilities including superhuman strength and durability, telekinesis, flight, force fields, translation of any language and the ability to breathe underwater and in space. Sam later finds out that this helmet belonged to his father, who was a member of the Nova Corps, the space police force that originated on the planet Xandar.
A movie about Sam Alexander’s Nova would be an interesting one and Marvel could go in several directions with the story. After seeing them in “Guardians of the Galaxy” (2014), the Nova Corps are not heard from again until the beginning of “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018) Exploring the rebirth of the corps could help fill the void for wacky space hijinks that the “Guardians of the Galaxy” might leave after their final movie. 
Although Sam Alexander’s character’s Latinx heritage is not really part of his identity in the comics, it’s possible and very easy for the MCU version to be more in touch with his Latinx roots since his origin story is rooted in where he comes from. 
Miss America (America Chavez)
More intersectional representation! America Chavez’s origins have been rewritten a few times, as she was originally from a dimension not bound to time or space called the Utopia Parallel. Recent rewrites cast her as a girl born to Puerto Rican doctors. Chavez was the subject of brutal experiments that gave her the ability to fly, travel dimensions, achieve bioluminescence and have bulletproof skin. 
America’s character is fascinating because she is relatively new, making her first comic-book appearance in 2011 and growing in popularity since. Part of this has to do with her being an LGBTQ+ woman of color, an often underrepresented demographic. 
Past that, however, Chavez is a unique and compelling character. Despite being a badass in every sense of the word, she struggles to deal with severe childhood trauma. The stories Marvel could tell with her are countless, and, hopefully, they are already setting up for that.
Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)
Marvel could also try and resurrect a failure from the past through Robbie Reyes’ version of Ghost Rider. He was born in East Los Angeles to Mexican American parents. After years of struggling with poverty and violence in his community, Reyes tries to get out of this situation by winning a street race for $50,000. He is then chased and senselessly murdered by mercenaries searching for something in the trunk of the car that Robbie “borrowed.” 
Before dying, however, Reyes is possessed by a spirit and resurrected as a demonic being with a flaming skull-like head. Reyes’ run as Ghost Rider has been up and down with mixed reactions from fans. His origin story is admittedly a little bit goofy and some of his stories have not been given good reviews by critics and fans alike. However, this should not dissuade Marvel from trying to find a place for the Ghost Rider character in their lineup. 
The character of Ghost Rider is unlike anything that’s been portrayed so far. Reyes is also a very sympathetic character, as most of his motivation comes from trying to help his brother Gabriel, who has no motor control over his legs.
If anything, Marvel needs to make this film just to right the wrong of the poorly received “Ghost Rider” (2007) film starring Nicolas Cage.

Growing up in Florida, Douglas Noble remembers frequent visits to national parks. He has filled his blue national park passport book with so many stamps that he can’t name a single favorite park.
Now a professor of architecture, Noble, along with his colleague Karen Kensek, have worked with the National Park Service at Joshua Tree National Park for more than a decade, where they’ve taken students on camping trips and recently designed a prototype restroom to replace the typical concrete boxes found at national parks. With their knowledge and admiration for the parks, Noble and Kensek designed a new course titled “An Exploration of America’s National Parks,” which they plan to offer this spring. 
The course will be taught by more than 25 professors from a wide variety of departments — including history, geology and music — and will take an interdisciplinary approach to learning about America’s 63 national parks. Although it is housed in the School of Architecture, the course will be open to students of all majors and require no prerequisites. 
The course will be split into seven modules, each with five to eight speakers. Each week a new group of lecturers will bring a new lesson on topics such as the history of the parks’ establishment and the music of Yellowstone. 
Noble, who also serves as the Associate Dean of the School of Architecture, said the origins of the course date back to about five years ago, when he was selected to go to USC’s Center for Excellence in Teaching, a campus institute aimed at supporting faculty in teaching development. 
At the institute, Noble met professors from several different departments, which he hadn’t had many opportunities to do beforehand. He began talking about his love for national parks and met several other professors who shared that passion. Soon after, a wide range of professors formed a group which shared one thing in common: a deep appreciation for national parks. 
According to Noble, it wasn’t hard to find the initial set of professors for the course. “People just love national parks,” he said. “We found lots and lots of folks.”
To match the course’s wide range of professor disciplines, Noble said he hopes to enroll a similarly diverse group of students. 
“If there are 100 [students enrolled], maybe seven architects would be a good number; three geologists, four archaeologists, two musicians and a couple of art students,” Noble said. 
The course will also involve collaborative work between students of different disciplines. They’re planning for team-based assignments, where a small group of students across majors would collaborate to research a national park. 
Among the dozens of lecturers lined up for the course is President Carol Folt, who commended the course’s interdisciplinary approach and expressed excitement to share her unique perspective. 
“Interdisciplinary courses such as these represent a unique opportunity to bring together diverse perspectives and ultimately foster appreciation and respect between disciplines,” Folt wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “At USC, we are privileged to be able to bring together expert faculty from across a variety of fields to examine our national parks, and as an environmental scientist, I’m excited about the chance to share my own passion for these national natural treasures with our students.”
History professor William Deverell said the course will give him the “great opportunity to show how the rise of the parks is fundamentally tied to other issues in the history and culture of 19th century America.” Writing professor Deborah Sims said she plans to teach students “how nature writers shaped the founding legislative protections which established National Parks, and the ways that their rhetorical approach continues to influence the conceptualization and consumption of nature in the 21st century.” 
Michael Johns, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, grew up going to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. Originally from Atlanta, Ga., he recently developed an appreciation for Western national parks and is interested in how the course will discuss the national parks’ history with Indigenous peoples. 
“I think it’d be cool to hear about the history relating to Indigenous peoples and … how the national parks went along with American imperialism,” Johns said. 
Axel Sánchez Sigala, a freshman majoring in business administration, lived in Joshua Tree, Calif., a town located right outside of the national park of the same name, for more than 10 years. Sigala said he’d like the course to discuss how these “gateway towns” interact with the parks they border.
“I think [bordering towns] tell a story about the national park and how it evolved,” Sigala said. “Although the class focuses mostly on the national park itself, I feel like if you branch out a little bit and explore, take a deep dive into the actual history of how the town originated [and the] smaller communities around it, that’d be a interesting angle, and something that’d actually be pretty fascinating to learn about.”
Noble himself looks forward to sharing an architectural perspective of the parks. He often looks to the visitor centers as a representation for the architecture of a park.
“There are lots of strongly held positions on new visitor centers [in the parks],” Noble said. “It’s a national park, so it has to be architecture at the absolute highest standards, but it should be architecture that doesn’t call attention to itself.”
Noble’s end goal with the course stems from going to national parks as he grew up, and his desire to increase awareness and access to the parks among a more diverse set of people. 
“You’ve got whole groups of people whose parents didn’t do that. There’s no tradition of sort of diversity, equity [and] inclusion in going to these places,” Noble said. “I want to build a whole new generation of national park lovers who will come to their defense, who will fight for keeping them, taking care of them, properly funding them, and visiting them.”

When she was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, Emily Cooperdock co-founded Science Y’all!, the official student science blog of UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences. The platform allowed graduate students to write about their research in layman’s terms and share their experiences and excitement for geoscience with the public. 
Cooperdock, now an assistant professor of earth sciences, expanded her outreach efforts. In September, the American Geophysical Union selected her as the 2021 inaugural Dorothy LaLonde Stout Education Lecturer. The annual award recognizes significant contributions to education and public outreach in earth or space science. 
“I’m really just humbled and honored,” Cooperdock said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There are a number of people who are doing such important work and making a big impact in terms of outreach and education that are equally deserving in my opinion of this [award], so it’s especially humbling and rewarding to receive it, knowing them as well.”
Cooperdock began teaching at USC in 2019, and her research includes the study of tectonic and geochemical processes. She was on her current maternity leave when she received news of the award.
“I’m not surprised [Professor Cooperdock] won this because she clearly rises to the level of this kind of award,” Frank Corsetti, Department Chair of earth sciences, said. “We’re really proud that she is at USC, and it’s a well-deserved award.”
To Cooperdock, education and public outreach have always taken an important role alongside her scientific research and work. Her interests in teaching, volunteering, and other forms of engagement have persisted for years. 
“When I started graduate school, and particularly in an earth sciences program, my number one job became learning how to be a scientist and doing cutting-edge primary research,” Cooperdock said. “That could take up all my time, but I knew for myself to feel like what I was doing had meaning and for me to feel complete, I had to have some engagement and outreach. So, I made time and participated in a variety of activities. I feel the same way now as a faculty member. It brings meaning and purpose to what I do.”
While enrolled at UT Austin, Cooperdock conducted outreach to K-12 students, delivering presentations to classes at a local high school and leading tours. She also provided career advice and assisted as a mentor for undergraduate research.
During her postdoctoral years, Cooperdock helped her friend and fellow graduate from the same doctoral program, Rachel Bernard, publish a paper in nature geoscience, which examined demographic data on doctoral graduates students in the geosciences and noted the underrepresentation of several ethnic and racial groups. 
The paper, titled “No progress on diversity in 40 years,” catapulted Cooperdock into a more influential position to voice her concerns about diversity, equity and inclusion in the sciences. Since then, Cooperdock published more papers on diversity and led conversations around diversity and race issues in the scientific and broader community at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. 
“I think that it’s very important to acknowledge that science isn’t completed in a vacuum divorced from society,” Cooperdock said. “We’re in an academic institution and we’re funded through agencies with people who are doing science, training each other and collaborating with each other. So of course, issues of [DEI] crop up.”
At USC, Cooperdock sought new opportunities to advocate for diversity, including talks at different academic institutions and the National Science Foundation.
Cooperdock was also determined to create a space reflective of her commitment to diversity when she started the USC Helium Lab, which measures the age of minerals and rocks to understand changes in the Earth’s crust over time. When she promoted the lab, Cooperdock created advertisements that welcomed students interested in DEI issues in addition to the scientific work. 
During the Spring 2021 semester, Cooperdock taught a new course she developed herself called “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in STEM.” The students in the class used primary literature and media to discuss a variety of DEI issues, with both a geoscience and a broader STEM focus.
“It really catered to each student’s motivation and what they’re passionate about in the DEI sphere,” Cooperdock said. “I’m excited about it because I think this is a key part of professional development right now. We should be teaching our graduate students how to engage in these discussions and to think about how they do their research, mentoring and teaching through this DEI lens.”
Anahi Carrera, a third-year graduate student studying geological sciences, took the class and recently attended a Geological Society of America conference to co-present a project about the underrepresentation of first-generation college students in United States Geoscience programs and ways to better support and recruit them. Carrera and her classmate completed the initial research and work while taking Cooperdock’s course.
“There’s definitely value in allowing [doctoral] students to also work on these efforts [outside of scientific research],” Carrera said. “It doesn’t mean that’s just taking time away or hindering their career. There are good things that can come out of it.”
Cooperdock advises students and connects them with different resources, events and outreach programs such as the USC Joint Educational Project. Cooperdock plans to continue providing graduate students with a broader perspective and support with skills like mentoring and working with DEI principles. 
“Right now, I’m particularly interested in the treatment, advising and preparation of our graduate student population, really focusing not only on training them how to be good scientists but the professional development side of things [too],” Cooperdock said. “I also hope to develop a bigger scale project. I’m still in the process of figuring out what that’s going to look like, but I see a few gaps that can be addressed. And the truth is there’s tons of gaps everywhere so we could all pitch in and make a difference just by focusing on the thing that really speaks to us.”
Correction: A previous version of this article implied that the National Science Foundation was an academic institution, but it is a federal agency. It also incorrectly stated that Cooperdock published a paper on demographics of postdoctoral students. She published a paper on demographics of doctoral graduates. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

In March 2019, more than 50 parents received federal charges for participating in Operation Varsity Blues, a criminal conspiracy to secure their children spots at prestigious universities, including USC, Yale and Georgetown. Shortly after the scandal went public, private college recruiter William “Rick” Singer admitted to organizing the scheme, which involved parents collectively paying more than $25 million in bribes to modify standardized test scores and have their children designated as athletic recruits. 
In the two years since the scandal broke and started national conversations about wealth, privilege and access to higher education, dozens of the defendants pleaded guilty to committing bribery and fraud. As of October 2021, 32 received their sentencing from the District of Massachusetts. 
The Daily Trojan compiled a list of some of the USC-involved parents, their most recent federal charges, court appearances, verdicts and post-release. 
Gamal Abdelaziz and John Wilson 
A federal jury convicted Gamal Abdelaziz and John Wilson of all charges in the first trial of the admissions scandal Oct. 8. Both Abdelaziz, a former casino executive, and Wilson, a former Staples Inc. executive, attempted to pay to have their children accepted to the University as fake sports recruits. 
Jeffrey Bizzack 
Solana Beach entrepreneur Jeffrey Bizzack paid $250,000 to admit his son into USC. Bizzack, one of pro surfer Kelly Slater’s former business partners, conspired with ex-USC women’s soccer coach Laura Janke to falsely portray his son as a nationally-ranked volleyball player. In 2019, Bizzack turned himself into authorities and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud. Shortly after, Bizzack received a two-month prison sentence and resigned from his company’s board. 
Mossimo Giannulli and Lori Loughlin
Fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli and Fuller House actress Lori Loughlin, his wife, paid $500,000 for their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose admission to the University as fake rowing team recruits. In 2020, Loughlin served two months in prison and Giannulli served five. 
After her parents’ conviction, Olivia Jade appeared on Red Table Talk and said she wanted “to show [she’s] grown.” In 2021, Jade also competed on the reality TV show “Dancing with the Stars.” When the scandal broke, Isabella Rose reduced her presence on social media and took a break from acting. 
Felicity Huffman
Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman spent 12 days in federal prison after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Huffman’s husband, actor William H. Macy, was not charged in the case. 
Huffman’s daughter, Sofia, made an appearance in the CBS All Access reboot of “The Twilight Zone” in 2020. Huffman is also set to work as executive producer of a new ABC comedy show. 
Douglas M. Hodge and Michelle Janavs
Former investment-management CEO Douglas M. Hodge paid $525,000 to have his son and daughter admitted to USC. In Feb. 2020, Hodge published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, writing that he wished he’d “never met Rick Singer.”
Michelle Janavs, a former executive of Chef America Inc. and the heiress to the Hot Pocket fortune, also facilitated her daughter’s admission to USC as a fake beach volleyball recruit. After her early release from prison in October 2020, Janavs returned to living in Newport Coast, Calif. 
When the admissions scandal came to light, Hodge and Janavs pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and bribery. Both parents also resigned from the Sage Hill School’s board of trustees. In February 2020, Hodge made headlines for receiving nine months in prison — which, to date, is the longest sentence of all the Varsity Blues parents who’d pleaded guilty in court.
Agustin Huneeus Jr. 
Agustin Huneeus, a Napa Valley winery owner, paid $300,000 for his daughter’s admission to USC. Because Huneeus didn’t have pictures of his daughter playing water polo, he sent admissions officers a photo of a stranger. In early 2019, Huneeus resigned as Chief Executive of Huneeus Vinters, and his father, Agustin Huneeus Sr., returned to the business to serve in his son’s place. 
Elisabeth Kimmel
Former KFMB Stations owner Elisabeth Kimmel paid $250,000 to have her son accepted as a pole vault recruit. After her arrest, Kimmel relocated to Las Vegas. She’s set to face sentencing in December 2021.
Toby MacFarlane
Toby MacFarlane, a USC alumnus and California title insurance executive, paid $450,000 to gain his daughter and son admission to his alma mater as fake soccer and basketball recruits, respectively. Although he received six months in prison, a federal judge released MacFarlane nearly three months early because of the pandemic. 
Marci Palatella
Marci Palatella, the CEO of International Beverage, and Lou Palatella, former San Francisco 49ers linebacker Lou Palatella, co-own Preservation Distillery in Bardstown, Ky. According to the District of Massachusetts’s United States Attorney’s Office, Marci paid more than $500,000 for her son’s admission to the University as a fake recruit for the football team. Palatella was not only successful in getting her son accepted to USC, but also wrote off her bribe payments as charitable donations on her tax returns. In 2021, she became the 33rd parent to plead guilty in the Varsity Blues scandal. 
Devin Sloane
Devin Sloane, a water treatment company owner, paid $250,000 to have his son admitted to USC as a “water polo player.” Sloane had his son pose for pictures in a swim cap and a Speedo in the family’s backyard pool to add to his fake athletic profile. In September 2019, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentenced Sloane to four months in prison. 
Homayoun Zadeh
When Homayoun Zadeh worked as a periodontist and tenured associate professor at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, he was caught conspiring with Singer and Janke to get his daughter a spot at the school as a lacrosse recruit. The Department of Justice reported Zadeh paid $100,000 in bribes to ex-coach Janke. After news of the scandal broke, Zadeh left his position at the University March 14, 2019. 
Robert Zangrillo
Miami real estate developer Robert Zangrillo was arrested in March 2019 under accusations of paying $250,000 to have his daughter transferred to the University as a rowing recruit. In January 2021 — nine months before he was set to stand trial — Zangrillo received a pardon from former President Donald Trump. 
In a press release explaining Trump’s decision, the White House wrote that Zangrillo was “a well-respected business leader and philanthropist.” The White House also stated that Zangrillo’s “daughter did not have others take standardized tests for her and she is currently earning a 3.9 GPA at the University of Southern California.” 
In the press release announcing Zangrillo’s pardon, the White House listed Tom Barrack, a California-based real estate investor who was on the University’s board of trustees, as a supporter of President Trump’s decision. In January, a spokesperson for Barrack denied that the trustee had any involvement in the pardon. 
In July 2021, Barrack, who chaired Trump’s inaugural committee, voluntarily resigned from his Board of Trustee position after he was arrested on charges of acting as an agent for the Middle East. 
Bill McGlashan
Before the Varsity Blues scandal, Bill McGlashan, a former executive for a private equity firm based in the Bay Area, was well-known for his philanthropy. In 2016, he co-founded the Rise Fund with Irish rock star Bono and eBay Inc. billionaire Jeff Skoll to work towards achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. In May 2021, McGlashan was sentenced to three months in prison after pleading guilty to paying $50,000 to alter his eldest son’s already near-perfect 33 ACT score.

In 2017, The Economist published an article claiming that oil, the world’s most valuable resource, had been replaced with data. This sentiment has been echoed and overstated everywhere. At universities and corporations, “data analyst” is emerging as the new hip career. Harvard Business Review even declared being a data scientist as the “sexiest job of the 21st century.” However, with so many wanting to be analysts and scientists, we completely overlook one question: Who collects all these datasets?
Obtaining “big data” isn’t as simple as sending a Google Form to your classmates — it’s collected and processed from the moment you connect to your Wi-Fi and sent every time you click a link, log in to a website or interact with a company. Most of the time, we have no choice but to agree to a company’s rules, such as mandatorily accepting cookies to use their website properly. Granted, most of this data isn’t directly harmful, as much of it remains unstructured and unprocessed. However, problems begin when companies start to treat data as valuable raw materials that can be leaked, traded and weaponized.
There are two main ways our data is exchanged — through corporations or data analysts and software programmers and criminals, who trade data “like Pokémon cards,” according to a cybersecurity specialist. 
Let’s start with corporations. While everyone knows the FAANG — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — companies, many people don’t know about the third-party companies, or “data brokers,” who obtain and sell our data to other companies for commercial use. 
For example, Acxiom LLC collects information from approximately 68% of the world’s internet population and sweeps it under the rug. Without the majority of the internet population even realizing it, these data brokers make millions of dollars by selling tracked data. 
According to Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, data brokers commercialize disturbingly sensitive datasets of personal information, including lists of sexual assault victims, domestic violence shelters and people suffering from genetic diseases and addictive behaviors. In addition to these cryptic datasets, data brokers sell information regarding consumer credit scores, mortgages and health scores.
On top of this, companies unfairly interpret this data. For example, some have resorted to sorting out qualified candidates in hiring processes through algorithms. These programs factor in completely unnecessary features, such as social capital, candidates’ connections on LinkedIn and geographic information. 
While I support technology use that improves human jobs, companies should not use pure data as a proxy for one’s capabilities, personality and potential. 
Additionally, criminals trade our data through the big data black market. A study conducted by Google and the University of California, Berkeley found that billions of usernames and passwords are currently at risk and 1.9 billion of those passwords were obtained through third-party data breaches from the companies that we just mentioned. 
Alarmingly, these stolen usernames and passwords can be purchased as easily and frequently as I purchase Pirate’s Booty from Target. Criminals produce automated shops where leaked username and password packages can be bought at varying prices. On these sites, you can literally buy someone’s identity, which is indexed to FICO scores, and much more: Titan HQ reports, “Diplomas for $100-400 … [and] passports are the real prize, garnering as much as $2000.”
While there is clear severity to the passport trading in the personal data underground economy, most people do not care; more specifically, most people do not know enough to care. Most people have no choice but to accept the terms of agreement and hand their data over to companies.
This is all cryptic information — but does that mean we should end data science and analytics? Despite the existence of data mismanagement, I remain an advocate for data driven decision making. In 2018, California passed the Consumer Privacy Act, along with 25 other states who passed data-related privacy regulations. 
While companies still find loop-holes, I remain optimistic we will eventually hold data oligopolies, such as the oil oligopolies of the past, to more equitable standards for taking our data for free. In tandem with the growing cybersecurity market, encryption technology is becoming more relevant and will make our interweb journeys safer. 
Data is here to stay. While the underground market for our information will continue to persist like any market, our generation is the most technologically literate, and I believe that the next users of the internet will begin to take privacy and personal data matters into their own hands.

Before essential workers were considered “essential,” they already had it rough. From wage theft to Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations to rampant customer entitlement, they face a myriad of hardships. Since the pandemic started, however, one number epitomizes their experience: 87.
According to a 2020 UC Merced study, an estimated 87% of excess deaths in California during the pandemic’s first 10 months were frontline workers. This same study estimated a 42% rise in excess deaths for restaurant and foodservice workers.
At USC, the dangers of being a frontline worker are abundantly clear. Dining hall workers work in close proximity to thousands of unmasked students in the residential dining halls. USC employees who scan Trojan Check come into contact with every student entering campus. USC custodial staff must go into students’ rooms in residential housing such as McCarthy Honors.
For these workers, every workday is a superspreader event. However, USC’s administration does not treat these workers like they’re taking this daily immeasurable risk. Many of these essential workers don’t make close to a livable wage in California: According to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, they should make $39.03 per hour, but the current Los Angeles County minimum wage is $15 per hour.
High unemployment and economic recessions coerce many into working these high-risk jobs, even with low pay — it’s either crumbs or nothing. These terrible labor conditions aren’t new at USC — plenty of worker protests have occurred throughout USC’s history, the latest one being Keck Medicine of USC nurses striking last July. 
The pandemic has only made these conditions worse, exemplified by our institution’s contradictory attitudes regarding the coronavirus. On one hand, USC mandates a one-urinal distance in the bathroom to prevent spreading the virus. When our institution squishes thousands upon thousands of people shoulder-to-shoulder for events such as the New Student Convocation, USC-sponsored concerts and football games, however, these same concerns turn into mere afterthoughts.
Our institution’s inconsistencies harm our front-line workers the most, as essential workers disproportionately live in overcrowded homes which exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Considering USC had 16,614 staff members during the 2020-21 school year and that a whopping 11% of Los Angeles lives in overcrowded housing — this number gets as high as 38% in the Westlake neighborhood — USC has an obligation to ensure its staff, and by extension, the greater L.A. community, remains healthy. As of now, they fail to do so. Mask mandates are enforced with, at most, disapproving looks, and workers’ wages definitely do not correspond to the coronavirus threat they must endure every day.
However, our University’s shortcomings do not absolve USC students of our faults — every day on campus and USC Housing, students bemoan coronavirus safety measures, desperately waiting for the University to lift safety regulations, such as the no-guest policy, which USC Housing will lift on Oct. 18. At football games, concerts and parties, students forgo their masks, allowing for easy transmission of the virus. After these events, students then return to close contact with these workers in dorms, dining halls, classrooms and more. 
We have the luxury of risking the contraction of coronavirus for the sake of our recreational events, while USC workers are subjected to it for their livelihood. Obligated to tend to approximately 49,500 students, USC workers’ chances of contracting coronavirus add up. 
As students, we are all directly liable for not only the lives of these people who keep our institution up and running, but also for their families, their loved ones and every person they encounter. It is not merely a suggestion — it is imperative that we prioritize their health over our minor inconveniences. 
We must support our workers and advocate for improving their conditions. We must not partake in irresponsible actions that endanger them. We must ensure they are compensated for the inconceivable risk they take every day. As USC students, we must do better for our frontline workers.
