Friends, family, love, life, light; though it may seem like a bit of a generalization, the essence of India’s biggest and brightest festival each year can be summarized in those few words. Cinema has always been deeply rooted in the modern and popular culture of India. Year after year, its stars are worshiped, its movies are memorialized and its songs become lifelines. The spirit of India is the spirit of cinema. 
At their best, the movies are filled with dazzling music and musical numbers, sweeping sets, epic action sequences, emotional melodramas and romances for the ages. The following films may all be fairly recent — some more than others — but they have no doubt solidified themselves in the modern Hall of Greats. They’re perfect not only for the holiday season, but also for any newcomer’s introduction to what Indian cinema is all about.
Celebrate… Friends
To say that director Ayan Mukerji resurrected the great Bollywood rom-com of a bygone era for the next generation with “Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani” may sound like a bit of an exaggeration, but after watching it, you just might see what I’m talking about. It was a film that quickly solidified itself in Bollywood pop culture history. There can never be such a thing as too many love stories. 
Nearly 10 years later and every song has still maintained its status as an all-time hit — seriously, the soundtrack is legendary. A coming-of-age musical about growing up, growing apart and growing together — and such a blast to watch every step of the way. The best way to describe this film is this: It’s one big, grand, happy party. Prepare to be energized and electrified by the power of friendship and love.
Celebrate… Family
The 2016 dramedy “Kapoor & Sons” is a classic dysfunctional family story. Beyond being an impeccably paced, genuine laugh-out-loud comedy, it is a celebration of brotherhood and an emotionally deft and complex exploration of love, grief, fidelity and sexuality. Loads of surprises and a rollercoaster of emotions await you. It’s a shockingly relatable film too — you’re sure to find yourself or someone you know amidst all the craziness. All in all, it’s a story so sweet, it hurts. This Diwali, fall in love with the Kapoor family.
Celebrate… Love
If you’re looking for the quintessential Bollywood melodrama, look no further than 2007’s “Om Shanti Om.” An epic tale of love and reincarnation set amidst the backdrop of the classic Bollywood film industry, it is everything I love about Indian cinema and cinema at large. Emotional, wholesome, hilarious and utterly show-stopping and mesmerizing at every turn. With a movie that celebrates art and life, you’ll want to sing, dance, laugh, boo and cheer. 
Celebrate… Life
Do not let the poster or the plot synopsis fool you, if no other film on this list makes you cry, then “3 Idiots” is the one that surely will. Immensely entertaining and emotionally staggering, it is a film that I think every student must see. Let it speak to you, and listen carefully. Brilliant messages are delivered beautifully with heart and humor. This film is the equivalent of a long, warm, comforting hug. The beauty of life is in the little things. Enjoy the little things, and enjoy “3 Idiots.”
Celebrate… Light
The 2022 (yes, 2022) Telugu-language regional film “RRR” is the only film I would be confident enough to throw on this list and declare as an instant Indian classic this early on in its run. It is three hours of pure insanity. Maximalism galore. Taking not only all of India but even Hollywood by storm this year, it is a rip-roaring, action-packed, emotionally-charged epic musical melodrama for the ages. The kind of movie you and a few friends will sit down to watch and end up screaming and cheering and losing your minds over. 
Believe me when I say that director S.S. Rajamouli knows how to work a crowd, be it two or 200. Call it hyperbole, but “RRR” is the very concept of action cinema ascending and peaking. An adrenaline-fueled celebration of bros being bros being absolutely bonkers. A true blockbuster and spectacle in every sense of the word, there is no other cinematic experience this year that comes close. If you want to celebrate the triumph of light and goodness this Diwali, look no further than the biggest and grandest cinematic celebration of the year.

Despite the curatorial nature of the medium, Taylor Swift’s approach to songwriting has always been rooted in a sense of authenticity, which has set her mastery apart from many of her contemporaries. The 32-year-old darling has built a career on accessibility and relatability, with a plethora of people finding solace in her music. All of her albums are guaranteed to be written by the artist herself, so it’s not hard to expect the creation of a vulnerable, comforting atmosphere. It’s what Swift does best. 
From easter eggs about acorns and Tiktok glitches to Variety Superbowl goose chases, there had been a steady stream of speculation that Swift had been up to something; fans had been predicting the re-release of worldwide hit album “1989” all the way up to “Midnights’” announcement at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards. 
What would this project sound like, given that this album would be the first autobiographical one since 2019’s “Lover”? Prior to the album’s release, there had been 13 mentions of midnights in Swift’s extensive lyrical catalog, the same number as the tracklist. Coincidence? Not for a woman known for her meticulous planning. “Midnights” nods to much of Swift’s post-Alwyn discography musically, with strong allusions to tracks such as “You Are In Love,” “Call It What You Want” and “Dress.” 
If you’re able to ignore the absurdity of the Zoë Kravitz credit, opener “Lavender Haze” follows the pattern of incredibly solid album trail markers. Lyrically similar to “Delicate,” this pulsating track is chock-full of references to ‘50s feminism, and it’s clear that Swift’s ability to pen the most infectious melodies has not disappeared. 
Right after the “Anti-Hero” episode of “Midnight Mayhems with Me,” Swift’s (alleged) departure from her typically coy album rollouts in the form of straight-forward track list reveals, she released an accompanying video claiming that it was “one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written.” She would be alone in that sentiment. The track is cobbled together in an attempt at authenticity, much like everyone’s favorite sexy baby, Renesmee Cullen. No amount of Swiftie-imprinting could save this song.
Unfortunately, this would merely be the beginning of the downward slope of this album. The eight-song traverse from “Anti-Hero” to “Labyrinth” falls prey to a phenomenon I’d like to call the Jack An-turn-off Syndrome. Save for the “Lover”-esque “Midnight Rain,” these songs are much like what happens when you spend midnights with a frat bro: a lack of climax. 
Many Swifties will continue to enjoy the album despite the quality of these skippable tracks, but remember that these are songs, not men. We shouldn’t be putting their personality over their performance. 
If “Vigilante Shit” was a contender to conjure up the campy villain from her magnum opus, “reputation,” the camp is more noticeable in the epic failure of an attempt which it is. With lyrics fit for the Lifetime channel, this track feels like the soundtrack for white girls who are going to dress up as the Taylor Swifts from the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video… using mom’s old stockings. This throwback is bad, and it shouldn’t be something that Swift should do over and over and over again. 
Thankfully, the 2016-tinged dark period in this album comes to a stark halt with the ecstatic “Karma.” This track introduces the idea that Taylor can write a biting track despite her lack of an ex to write about since 2016. There’s only one thing that would elevate the song from its already-pristine state: adding the line “Karma is a gay icon.”
Following that, the closer track “Mastermind” is another entry into Swift’s exploration of womanhood. As she sings, “You see, all the wisest women / Had to do it this way / ‘Cause we were born to be the pawn / In every lover’s game.” There’s an attitude that Swift sings with, as if to say “not a lot going on at the moment” without actually meaning it. It’s a well-earned punchline, as her masterful whims have always led the industry.
Unfortunately, even the strongest of Swift’s catalog would not be able to eclipse the emaciated mid-section of this project, with ugly ducklings like that of “Snow on the Beach” shouldering much of the burden. For a collaboration with “Stargirl Interlude” potential, not only did Swift deliver a Lana-at-Saturday-Night-Live mistake of a song but she did it without even allowing Lana near said beach. Del Rey was now part of Taylor’s “background brigade,” along with other female headliners such as Maren Morris, HAIM, Colbie Caillat and the Dixie Chicks. 
With all these factors taken into account, “Midnights” deserved a 2 out of 5 stars.
That was, until the clock rang thrice on the morn of the 21st.  This was the moment, as Ed Sheeran had once sang, that everything had changed. Seven new songs came as a plea for redemption, flaunting three much-missed Aaron Dessner co-writes. 
For an album that had rooted in unintentional motifs of four-on-the-floor drum machines, synths and basslines too similar to that of Lorde, Dessner’s arrival was an immaculate antithesis to the missteps in the album’s first release — a breath from the “drought that was the very worst.” His dense instrumentation on the magnificent “The Great War” must have inspired Antonoff to awaken from his slumber to create the album’s chef-d’oeuvre: “Bigger Than The Whole Sky,” the coalescence of Swift’s best qualities.
Swift’s folkloric writing ability makes a much-appreciated return in this gorgeous ballad. With a backing track that recalls “Lover”’s album-closer “Daylight,” this is the reflective, self-antagonizing anthem that “Anti-Hero” purported to be: “Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness.” This meditation becomes a cinematic wonder that begs listeners to embark on a midnight ride and contemplate life, much like Swift and her various pens had been doing. 
If Swift were to have written Rina Sawayama’s sophomore album “Hold The Girl,” she would’ve made “Dear Reader” the cornerstone. It would be sacrilegious to end a project without ethereal piano, and Swift delivers exactly that, with risers and pads as atmospheric accents. Swift’s strength as a purveyor of literary references works so well in her lyricism, and her usage of Jane Eyre’s infamous line, “Dear reader, I married him,” introduces many new complexities to the already stellar track. 
Antonoff must not be a Starbucks lover, as his work has begun to feel tired. If he had been well rested from not having to operate within the nightmare blunt rotation of the industry’s strongest female artists, he may have caught some of Swift’s absurd lyrics that she managed to sprinkle throughout the project. Contenders for craziest lines range from awkward phrasings such as “Now it’s like snow at the beach / Weird, but fucking beautiful” and “I’ll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror” to double-takes like “Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I’m a monster on the hill” and “Lock broken, slur spoken / Wound open, game token.”
“Midnights” boasted a release full of enough surprises, content and memes to satisfy even the most voracious fan. However, when the musical integrity falters to the extent it does on this album, these tactics fall to futility. Adult pop, a genre that Swift has struggled with in the past, is not meant to be just childrens’ songs with profanity and mentions of hard drugs. Sophisticated (yet consumable) music should not be an unreachable feat for the creator of the 2021 GRAMMYs’ Album of the Year. 
For her 10th non-re-recorded release, this project was not a fitting addition to the Taylor Swift canon. As the album continues to grow with the impending Swift-directed music videos, we’ll just have to see which tracks are sleeper hits and which are snoozers. Till then, since Swift seems to be so obsessed with numbers, here’s one for “Midnights”: 3/5 stars.

Upon arriving at the La Brea Tar Pits, visitors are greeted by a penetrating asphalt smell from a sinkhole. Within the sinkhole lies a recreation of a mammoth being trapped in tar, an illustrative introduction to the history and collections of the museum. Inside, huge skeletons of creatures such as saber-toothed cats, mammoths and mastodons reveal a glimpse of life from the Ice Age.
The museum was recently selected as one of the most important geological heritage sites by the International Union of Geological Sciences. This museum, one of the three Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County, is the world’s only active urban Ice Age fossil dig site, is a 20-minute drive from the University Park Campus and is free for all USC students with a USC student ID. 
When Frank Corsetti, professor of earth sciences, heard the news of this distinction granted to the La Brea Tar Pits, he said that the museum deserved to be recognized.
“It really is an absolutely world class deposit that happens to be right in the middle of downtown Los Angeles,” Corsetti said. “It’s a common conception that when you think about going to find fossils, you’re going off to some mountaintop in some remote area, not driving down Wilshire.” 
The La Brea Tar Pits is an active fossil dig site, where plants and animals from the last 50,000 years are discovered every day. In the outdoor space, excavators carve fossils out of the asphalt; inside the museum, visitors can look through glass windows into the Fossil Lab, a space where volunteers and scientists clean and conserve fossils that were discovered in the pits.
When reflecting on the distinction in a global context, Hank Woolley, a doctoral student studying earth sciences, said he thought the distinction came at an ideal time for the institution given their upcoming plans to renovate and update the museum.
“It’s really special that they have this really cool international recognition, on par with other UNESCO world heritage sites,” Wooley said. “These places have exceptional fossil preservation, so it’s all good news for the Tar Pits.”
While most consider the La Brea Tar Pits a tourist attraction, earth scientists like Corsetti view it as a scientific goldmine. 
“In vertebrate paleontology, when you are looking at the larger animals, typically, you don’t have a lot of fossil material. If you’re lucky, you’ve got two or three leg bones. You go to the La Brea Tar Pits and you can find hundreds, if not thousands of those same fossils,” Corsetti said. “It allows the scientists to do things they wouldn’t be able to do under a regular fossilization circumstance where you only have one or two [fossils].”
Students at USC visit the pits through the “The History of Life on Earth: A View from the Museum” course, a general education class in which one of the labs includes a trip to the La Brea Tar Pits. According to Corsetti, students have the opportunity to see each step of the fossil collecting process here — they can go out to the active digging site, to the fossil lab where they are prepared and then wander the site looking for specific fossils.
Kiersten Formoso, a doctoral student studying earth sciences, makes regular trips to the La Brea Tar Pits and said she considers the museum “one of [her] favorite areas to hang out, once you get past the smell of the natural asphalt.” 
“It is not just a dead site; there is still asphalt that seeps up out of the grass,” Formoso said. “If you go there, there are little green cones everywhere because new sticky tar is seeping up from the ground.”
The La Brea Tar Pits serves not only as an incredible site for tourists, but as a community fixture for Angelenos as well. Excavation at the museum occurs daily, at sites open for visitors to see.
“What makes [the La Brea Tar Pits] truly special is that you can go and watch a live fossil excavation for free and talk to the scientists right there … in Hancock Park,” Woolley said. “Not only are you going to the site where all of these animals got stuck and died … there’s very few places in the world where you can do that.”

USC students and pro-cannabis groups on campus are hopeful for a renewed perspective on marijuana after President Joe Biden promised to fix the country’s “failed approach” toward the drug.
On Oct. 6, President Biden pardoned thousands of people convicted of simple marijuana possession. The president released a series of Twitter statements justifying the decision and called on local and federal officials to review marijuana-related policies, such as the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. 
“Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana,” Biden wrote in a Twitter post following the pardons. “Today I announced a pardon of all prior federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana, urged governors to do the same, and asked HHS and the DOJ to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.”
Biden pardoned prior federal offenders on the basis that people convicted of such offenses may be denied employment, housing or education.
Marijuana advocates at USC applauded Biden’s efforts while pushing for increased tolerance of the drug. Christophe Merriam, a freshman majoring in business of cinematic arts, said he believes the legalization of marijuana is long overdue.
“Nobody is dying from marijuana, and marijuana isn’t a health crisis,” Merriam said. “If you’re really gonna be like, ‘It makes a person lazy or act stupid,’ you can easily say the same thing about drinking, but drinking is so normal and socially acceptable, so that’s just ridiculous.”
Arguments against cannabis originate from a history of skepticism from the scientific and broader community, said Julianna Montano, president of Cannabis at USC and a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law and pharmacology and drug development.
“It’s not fully embraced by the scientific community because it’s really hard to parse data and research that’s out there,” Montano said. “So the stigma is definitely still very strong even though there are a lot of legislative measures that push through.”
If federal legislation legalizing marijuana passes, it will open the floodgates to business, health and science opportunities. Montano said she aims to educate the USC community about the benefits of cannabis while providing club members with opportunities in the growing industry. 
“Cannabis at USC is not only an opportunity for students to speak with like-minded people, be a part of the dialogue or understand cannabis from deeper than a surface level,” Montano said. “But also to understand the inner workings of operation, supply chain and the growing economy behind this plant as it continues to be legalized for both medical and recreational use throughout the nation.”
The United States House of Representatives passed a bill in April that would nationally decriminalize cannabis. If the legislation becomes law, it will remove marijuana from the list of scheduled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, legalizing the manufacture, distribution and possession of the drug.
An increasing number of states are taking local measures to legalize the drug medically and recreationally. In the past 20 years, more than half of the states in the U.S. have legalized weed for medical use. 19 of those states also allow the recreational use of marijuana.
“This is going to be a new era of therapeutics and medicine for people in the future, and people should be educated about it,” Montano said.
Advocates also aim to address the racial stigma surrounding marijuana consumption. During the 1900s, the U.S. government outlawed marijuana following an influx of immigration from Mexico. Prejudice against immigrants extended to marijuana, which immigrants introduced as a recreational drug.
“A lot of the laws surrounding cannabis were rooted in racism … it was just another reason to lock people up,” Merriam said. “A lot of it is rooted in falsehoods and misinformation.”
The government outlawed cannabis after conducting studies that linked violence and deviant behavior with marijuana consumption in non-white communities. The discriminatory investigations created a negative stigma based on racism that persists today.
According to a 2020 American Civil Liberties Union study, Black men are incarcerated nearly four times more often than white men for marijuana-related offenses, despite roughly equal usage rates. In some states, Black people are up to nine times more likely to be apprehended for cannabis possession.
“Most of the time, the reasons that weed has been criminalized has been based off systemic racism deeply rooted in the American government, so there’s no reason that it should be criminalized,” said Daniel Stone, a freshman majoring in business administration. “We all know that cannabis has been a systemic racism issue in America of criminalizing Black men.”
Decriminalization will address safety issues on multiple fronts, but will not be universally accepted. While lessening the potential for discriminatory arrests and allowing for research to make cannabis consumption safer, mass consumption may evoke backlash from opponents of recreational use.
“I could foresee [decriminalization] happening within the next 10 years just because there is a huge demand for it and a huge demand for access,” Montano said. “But I don’t exactly know what the steps will be towards that. I think opening up the floodgates will result in a lot of consequences, both socially and politically. But, you know, it kind of has to happen.”

USC welcomed more than 200 prospective students from around the country Friday and Saturday to attend its second annual Minority Serving Institutions graduate and professional recruitment conference, hosted by the Office of Inclusion and Diversity.
The program selected visiting students from Minority Serving Institutions, including historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, Asian American and Pacific Islander institutions, and native and tribal schools. Student participants received an application fee waiver for up to three graduate programs and their travel expenses were subsidized by the University.  
Myra Turner, a professor of journalism and lead organizer of the event, said the application process for minority students to attend this year’s graduate recruitment conference included a GPA requirement and a short personal statement of why they wanted to come to USC. 
“I can’t wait to get all of these students in one space so they can see what we’re about and we can hear all about their journeys,” Turner said in a press release.
The recruitment fair kicked off with a welcome reception Friday evening at Wallis Annenberg Hall’s Alumni Patio, where visiting students connected with faculty, administrations, admissions personnel and other students. 
Aaron Proctor, a senior majoring in political science at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, said he was excited about meeting new people and learning about the resources the University has to offer to its students. 
“I want to expand my horizons and go somewhere I haven’t been before to build a network,” Proctor said. 
Another prospective student, Ian Evans, who grew up in Inglewood, Calif. and graduated from Tuskegee University with a business administration degree, said he was impressed with the University’s effort to increase the diversity with the graduate students.
“I’m excited about seeing the community here at USC. It’s a campus that I have always admired and respected since I was a young adult and a teenager being here from Los Angeles,” Evans said. 
The “In Formation: Dream Big Conference” continued Saturday, with students participating in breakout sessions at different USC schools, going on campus tours conducted by student leaders from the Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association, attending featured lectures and joining an alumni panel. 
This year, 20 USC schools participated in the Minority Serving Institutions graduate recruitment fair, an increase from 13 in last year’s pilot program. Students who could not participate in person attended a webinar for each school’s information session. 
In the breakout session at the School of Cinematic Arts, Desa Monique Philadelphia, an SCA communications and development writer, answered students’ questions about the competitive admission process and what it means to be rejected. 
“Whether you get accepted or not, it does not necessarily says anything about your talent and ability … Unfortunately, it’s just a limited number of spots, and so [the admission personnel] are putting together a cohort of who they think will work well together and who have the goals that they think will benefit being in the class together,” Philadelphia said. “The short answer is, please apply again.” 
Beyond offering resources for visiting students to help them make graduate school decisions, the conference marks the University’s continuous effort to diversify the student body at the graduate level. 
Maddy Brown, a sophomore majoring in journalism, said USC has been a historically white college, so there is always a need to diversify the student body, especially at the graduate level. 
“It’s the grad school particularly that has not seen a lot of diversity. The institution does more work to diversify [on the] undergrad [level],” Brown said. “Events like this are really important when [the Office of Inclusion and Diversity] reaches out to historically Black colleges and invites them to look at our school instead of expecting them to do all the work.” 
Sara Balanta, a freshman majoring in journalism, recognized that the University has a diverse student body at the undergraduate level, but that the graduate level lacks the same level of diversity. 
“I knew [USC] was more diverse compared to other colleges I was looking at. I also think there is a big difference in undergrad and grad,” Balanta said. “You have Somerville, which is the all Black floor and party chair, and there’s a kind of a lot of different outlets where you can find communities of people of color [at the undergraduate level].”
Turner recognized that while recent statistics may indicate there has been some issue with diversity and inclusion, she is glad that University administration supports these types of minority-serving conferences. 
“I am hopeful that programs like this will accelerate the effort [to diversify the student body],” Turner said. “We are making positive steps in the right direction.”

When I was in the seventh grade, my English teacher asked the class to write about where they would be in 20 years. I was only 12, but I was confident that I would live in a penthouse in the middle of a bustling city with a room dedicated to plants. I would vacation in Martha’s Vineyard and make a living as a molecular biologist — I didn’t even know what molecular meant at the time. Still, it sounded like something a person living in a penthouse would do. My friends at the time found this plan strange for several reasons.  
One, what about a husband? I told them I would be marrying Nick Jonas, but that dream was quickly crushed.
Two, what about kids? This question struck me. What about them? The possibility of kids wasn’t written in my notebook or scribbled in the margins like my celebrity crush was. To me, there was a greater possibility of marrying a Jonas brother than having a child, simply because it wasn’t ever on my mind. There was no desire to have kids in my 20 year plan, and now, as a 19-year-old, there still isn’t.
I can’t recall when I initially decided that having children wasn’t for me. However, I can remember the pushback from my choice to be vocal about my preference. You name it — I’ve heard it. “Never say never. You can’t possibly be sure. Who will take care of you in the future?” Even in 2022, women deciding not to have kids still poses a shock to some people. With notions such as the biological clock, it seems like having kids is less of a choice for women and more of an expectation. After the unfortunate overturning of Roe v. Wade, many women sought sterilization. As covered by the Los Angeles Times, women, such as Abby C., were denied time and time again by their gynecologists, who cited that their patients’ ages were reason enough to postpone sterilization. Abby C. was 23. Old enough to vote, to drink, to get legally married, but apparently not yet old enough to decide she never wanted children. What was it about her decision that was so controversial, and why should women be able to choose to go child-free? Let’s talk about it.
We can’t talk about having children without discussing the cost of raising them. It’s no secret — kids are expensive. And technically, being a kid myself, I know the price of all my birthday and Christmas wish lists were nothing short of catastrophic. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the annual cost of infancy care in California is $16,945, which averages to $1,412 per month — 1.5% more than the average rent. It’s not just California that faces these costs; the entire country’s prices vary. But there’s one thing for sure: childcare costs are increasing, yet wages have remained continually stagnant. The minimum wage in California is just $15 per hour, and with the hours of a full-time worker being at least 40 per week that comes out to $2,400 a month. This income doesn’t take into account rent, utilities or taxes. Between the coronavirus pandemic and this current recession, the economy has made it increasingly difficult to afford to have children.
If you’re lucky enough to not worry about your bank account going dry, let’s move on to the fact that the world is essentially dying. Climate change has proven to be a significant issue beyond the economy, and we are still searching for a resolution. Not to mention, I can barely get through class without the inevitable destruction of our planet being brought up at least three times. 
The lack of environmental stability has left this generation with a looming sense of dread about the future. What will the Earth look like in 10 years? In 20? How can we reverse the existing damage and prevent it from worsening in the future? These sorts of questions are continually brought up and should be considered when deciding to have kids. New York Times writer Alex Williams states, “Among childless adults…surveyed by Morning Consult last year, one in four cited climate change as a factor in why they do not currently have children.”
And, of course, reasons such as the economy or the world’s environmental state don’t have to factor into the decision to go child-free. Just like having children is a personal choice, so is not having them. Why be so obsessed with bringing more children into the world when there are nearly 44,000 children in the United States alone that don’t have any family taking care of them? 
It’s time to stop vilifying and interrogating women who don’t want to have children. Women’s bodies are their own — not their partners’, their parents’ or strangers on the street’s who all think they deserve a say in the personal decision to forgo children. I’ve always known that having children was just not a personal ambition of mine. And I’m not alone — Forbes conducted a study of 100 Generation-Z women, and 27% stated they do not want kids. Prominent figures such as Oprah Winfrey, Marisa Tomei and even Dolly Parton are also just a few of the women in the spotlight who are vocal about their decision to go child-free.
To the concerns listed above; “Well, never say never,” — it’s a never. “You can’t possibly be sure,” — yes, I’m sure. And as to who will take care of me when I get older? Well, let’s cross that bridge when we get there.

Growing up in an Asian community, I’ve heard pretty much every stereotype in existence — and I can confidently say that most of them aren’t true. I’m not just talking about outrageous ones like eating dogs, which only applies to a small percentage of Asians. I’m speaking in a more general sense about Asian parenting — a topic that I consider myself certified to discuss, given that most of my friends’ and my own parents are Asian (surprise surprise!). Take my own upbringing for example.
Born and raised in Hawaii until I was eight years old, I lived on my grandma’s flower farm and spent most of my time chasing chickens and running through the fields with my brother. Sometimes, I’d walk over to my aunt’s house to watch TV and eat junk food. With Waimanalo Beach less than 10 minutes away, I spent my time basking in the sun, building sandcastles and boogie boarding the day away.
During the school year, my parents drove my brother and me to Manoa Elementary School, which I saw as just a place to be with friends. To this day, I don’t know what kind of grades I got, but considering the amount of studying I did (zilch), my report cards definitely weren’t pretty. Still, I was never scolded and, honestly, I thought I was doing pretty well. 
At the time, my mom worked multiple jobs and my dad was going for his Ph.D., so they couldn’t pick my brother and me up right after school. Since a lot of people in Hawaii are Japanese, my parents decided to send us to a Japanese afterschool. Sadly, all I remember from two years in that afterschool is how to fold a paper crane — though I did become decently literate in the language at one point. 
Anyhow, my parents were too busy to be the overbearing shadow that Asian parents are often portrayed as. As long as my brother and I didn’t get into trouble, all was fine. I wasn’t pressured to do well academically and I didn’t go to any tutoring centers — though, to be fair, it was partly because we couldn’t afford it. 
When they did find the time, my parents always showed their affection rather openly. My mom would take my brother and me on hikes and golf cart rides around the farm. Every day after Japanese school, my dad took us to pick up my mom from work and she’d always have small candies and chocolates to give us. 
Contrary to the stereotype, my dad loved spending time with us, fooling around in the backyard and taking us along as he worked on the farm. He would carry us on his shoulders and teach us to climb trees — none of that “Asian dads can’t show affection” nonsense.
Obviously, not every Asian is brought up this way and some would say that my parents are very unusual, but Asians and “Asian” parenting can’t be clumped into one category. At the end of the day, Asian parents are people too, with their own set of flaws, trauma and experiences that make up who they are — just like everyone else. 
Still, like all stereotypes, there is some truth in the reputation that Asian parents get. Considering the perspective of immigrant parents, it’s understandable that some would place immense pressure on their children to do well academically and in the workforce. After sacrificing so much and growing up in more conservative cultures, many Asian immigrant parents restrict the amount of time their children spend with friends. Some forbid sleepovers and dating, and in some cases, conservative gender roles are enforced, restricting the interests that their children are allowed to explore.
Generally, Asian culture is less warm and accepting than Western counterparts, but love is still expressed — just in different ways. My mom, who immigrated to America to be with my dad, had to work multiple jobs to support my family. Oftentimes, coworkers would shun her for speaking less-than-perfect English. With her paltry income, she chose not to buy jewelry or new clothes, but to provide the resources that my brother and I needed to succeed. We celebrated the small things, and after my dad got his Ph.D., we moved to California and enjoyed a higher standard of living.
Still, to this day, my mom almost never buys anything for herself. She doesn’t have a designer purse and doesn’t wear jewelry, but enjoys ordering treats from bakeries and restaurants for my family to enjoy. Her affection is shown more openly than the stereotype of Asian parents would suggest, but the underlying theme applies to other Asian parents. Their strongest expression of love is through sacrifice.

After a 1-1 draw against the University of Colorado, the Trojans returned to Los Angeles without a win from their Rocky Mountain road trip. 
USC entered the weekend No. 15 in the AP Poll and just one win behind UCLA and Stanford in the Pac-12 standings, but a pair of disappointing draws against Utah and Colorado has left their conference title hopes in jeopardy.
Coming off a stale 0-0 result in Salt Lake City, USC hoped to get their attack firing in Boulder but ultimately tied 1-1. 
“We were happy to come back and at least take the tie instead of the loss, but [we] still feel pretty poorly about it,” said Head Coach Jane Alukonis. 
The Trojans dominated possession for most of the match, progressing the ball into final third with ease. Once in position to create chances, though, USC struggled to make their possession count.
Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer had the first semi-threatening shot of the match, striking a shot low into the left post from inside the 18-yard box. Minutes later, sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio followed up Farmer’s effort with a well-placed free kick towards the back post, which ricocheted off of a couple Colorado defenders and provoked a goal-line clearance from the Buffaloes. 
Once Colorado staved off the initial pressure, they settled into the match and began to threaten on the counterattack. In the 13th minute, Colorado junior forward Shyra James—who has 11 goals so far this season—thought she broke the deadlock with a well-placed header, but the linesman deemed her offside.
USC continued to play the ball quickly into Colorado’s half, only to find that they didn’t like the options once they arrived. Sampaio, Farmer, sophomore forward Simone Jackson and senior midfielder Croix Bethune cycled the ball around Colorado’s box, trying to make something happen to no avail. At one point, Sampaio unleashed a ball over Colorado’s backline for sophomore forward Kayla Colbert to track down. Colorado’s goalkeeper, sophomore Bella Grust, rushed off her line to clear Sampaio’s pass, but Grust scuffed the kick, creating a nervy moment for Colorado’s center backs. Colbert wasn’t able to reclaim the loose ball and shoot, allowing Colorado to clear.
Moments later, Colorado’s senior midfielder Jade Babcock-Chi received the ball in transition, dancing around multiple USC midfielders and surging into the open space. Babcock-Chi played the ball into senior forward Civana Kuhlmann’s feet, who took a touch to create space then struck a clean shot with her left foot from outside the box. The ball flew past USC’s graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith to give Colorado the lead. It was Kuhlmann’s 11th goal of the season. 
For the rest of the first half and most of the second, USC worked for a goal tirelessly. By halftime, USC had outshot Colorado 11 to 3, a trend that continued for the rest of the match. Senior defender Nicole Payne had multiple surging runs into Colorado’s half but didn’t have the accompanying runs around her to create a real chance.
Around the 63rd minute, USC started to challenge Grust with shots on target. Jackson had two opportunities in quick succession, rolling a left-footed shot into Grust’s grasp, then a right-footer that Grust saved with her feet in the next possession. Grust appeared to be in considerable pain after Jackson’s second shot and stayed down on the field, but she decided to continue playing and waved towards the crowd to rile them up. Everything appeared to be going the Buffaloes’ way. 
With USC’s constant pressure, though, Colorado’s defense finally cracked in the 75th minute. Graduate defender Brandi Petersen lofted a ball into Colorado’s 18-yard box that Buffaloes fifth-year defender Hannah Sharts deflected back into the air, allowing Farmer to head the ball into the net for the tying goal.
Once the score was even, both teams chased the winning goal, but neither side had the execution or gas left in the tank necessary to pull ahead. USC subbed Jackson back onto the field but the ball never reached her feet for a scoring chance. 
Speaking after the game, Head Coach Jane Alukonis noted that “[Colorado] saw Utah have success in a five-back against us and they were comfortable sitting in a bit, but they always kept two forwards high… and one punished us.” 
Results aside, Coach Alukonis was still pleased with the number of chances the team created, even if it did not translate to a win. “We’ve been trying to talk to the team about expanding the width and creating more options in the attack and I think we created, we just didn’t finish.”
Coach Alukonis singled out sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall and Farmer for their strong individual performances. 
USC heads back to Los Angeles with a slim chance of winning the Pac-12 regular season title. Crosstown rivals UCLA also traveled to Colorado and Utah over the weekend, winning their two games by a combined 9-0 score and exiting the weekend tied for first place with Stanford. Both teams own a 7-1-0 in-conference record.
Looking towards the end of the season, Coach Alukonis said she’s looking for “goal-scoring and sticking to our principles” for the last few matches. “Nothing brand new, just sharpening what we already do.”
The Trojans will be looking to bounce back with a win against Washington at 2 p.m. Wednesday at Soni McAlister Field.

Without a formal gym membership or passes to yoga sessions, it’s sometimes difficult to muster the energy or creativity to program another home workout. There are online subscriptions and exercise apps that want to take the guesswork out of surf fitness, but are they really worth your money?
McKinsey reported that fitness tech apps raised $2 billion of investor money in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic shifted people’s consideration of wellness as a top priority. The report noted the share of people using fitness apps grew from 50% to 75% in June 2020, with 70% reporting they planned on continuing or even increasing their use of online fitness guides after the pandemic. 
This is great news for developers looking to break into the fitness tech space and for surfing-adjacent entrepreneurs looking to take advantage of the thousands of new surfers that entered lineups during the pandemic.
World Surf League tour veteran Joel Parkinson was one of the first to kick off this development strategy almost 10 years ago with his Pro Surf Training app. The program followed the Aussie around different Championship Tour events, such as Snapper Rocks and Teahupo’o, to bring you different fitness programming and exercises specific to the demands of certain spots. 
Some other professional surfers have also joined the mix with their own programming, such as Jamie O’Brien’s app, which promises you’ll learn from a pro instead of a “lineup kook” for $99 a year. Others, like Koa Smith, have partnered with established health platforms to add their “expert instruction” for $72 for nine weeks to the mix of offerings. 
Other apps have been spearheaded by fitness gurus who offer more of the same as the previous, such as Surf Athlete for $119.99 per year or the newer and bougier OMBE, which promises you’ll “share the stoke” for just $249 a year.
Granted, most of these programs come out cheaper than any gym membership or pay-by-day class pass, which can be the more attractive option for many just looking for more pointed instruction. But besides the instructors and UI designs, there is very little that differentiates the programs’ makeups.
Most, if not all, of these programs emphasize a few key tenets in mobility and strength training, along with offering specialized workouts to build paddling strength, fix your pop-up or hit the skate park to practice carves and cutbacks. At a minimum, you’ll be doing some front squats, push-ups and hip 90/90s with every single program. 
The rest? This is arguably where the purpose of the apps seems fleeting. Barring terrible conditions, the best place to improve your paddling strength is in the wave. The best place to learn pop-up? The whitewater. The best place to work on your cutback? In front of the lip. Many programs can emphasize an on-land fix for many techniques that just won’t coalesce without serious time in the water.
If you’re really looking to improve on the dry-land training, most of what you can do for home workout inspiration is included in the oft-promoted Instagram reel. Cross-training in swimming and running, often underemphasized for surfers, can be revealed in the classic “What is Your Favorite Surfer Doing to Train” article that circulates every few months or so.
This is not to say that some of these apps do include some expertise on specific corners of health and surfing. Jamie O’Brien is a Pipeline master, and that’s a very unique entry point into this business. Cris Mills has a slew of different certifications and can tell you when that mobility issue might need a doctor rather than a surf coach.
But surfing is so much more expensive than these little add-ons. Many who are interested in the sport can’t justify the price points, and they shouldn’t have to. While surf fitness apps are great for someone with the time and the money to invest in these touch-ups, the apps tend to distract from the greater goal of applying these skills in the water. 
Go get a quick tutorial on YouTube before making the tempting choice of yet another monthly subscription. Dedicating time and effort to a few key exercises and stretches can make more of a difference than you can imagine for your surfing — all for free.
Lauren Mattice is a first-year law student exploring issues surrounding the surf community. Her column, “Wave Check,” runs every other Monday.

Can you believe that October is almost over?
By my next column, it’ll already be the first week of November. So, before we say goodbye to this month, I have to talk about one last topic before it’s no longer relevant: Halloween.
Now, Halloween was never a big deal in my country, but having watched a lot of American media, I grew up craving that trick-or-treating experience. So whenever Oct. 31 rolled around, I would don a costume and go door to door in my apartment building. And I’m happy to say that I’d usually come home with a total of … six M&Ms and one tablet of chocolate. I wish I was kidding. 
Maybe it’s because my trick-or-treating went so badly that I turned to the other quintessential Halloween activity: horror media. And even though I was (and sadly still am) easily scared and have a fear of basically anything, I still sat down and watched the newest horror movies. Sure, I had trouble sleeping for the next three days, but the feeling of having celebrated Halloween made all the nightmares worth it.
Of course, movies weren’t the only horror media that I interacted with. As I grew older, I slowly but surely began to dip my toes into horror games as well. I remember the first time I booted up “Resident Evil 4” on my PS2 and realized that, unlike movies, I had to be the one to deal with all the scary stuff, not just the protagonist. I had only ever played “Lego Star Wars II”, and as much as solving Lego puzzles is fun, it doesn’t teach you what to do when crazy chainsaw-wielding maniacs and mutating zombies are trying to kill you. Suffice to say, these games were more than what my child self could handle.
Still, in my efforts to feel like I truly got into the spirit of Halloween, I persevered through these games and beat them. Nowadays, even though I live in the United States and could celebrate Halloween, I still choose to forego any parties and keep up with my twisted tradition, submitting myself to hours of torture and fear as I play the newest horror games. 
But thanks to a recent trend in the industry, this might change. I’ll still be playing horror games, but they won’t necessarily be new. Thanks to studios deciding to remake their horror games, I’ll be playing the same titles I did when I was a kid, and I couldn’t be more excited.
To be fair, there’s certainly a big element of nostalgia involved in all of my happiness here, but we’ve also been in a rough patch for mainstream horror games. Sure, there may have been a couple of great games released in the past decade, but it’s rare to see any of them reach the level of popularity and lasting impact that titles like “Dead Space” and “Silent Hill 2” reached. Even if we look at indie games, which had an explosion of popularity and access over the past years, most of them act more as incomplete “walking simulators” rather than horror games, let alone good ones. So, for those of us who have been craving a genuinely great horror experience, seeing these reliable titles coming back obviously puts a smile on our faces again, especially since it shows that the companies are finally paying attention to the genre once more.
Now, as excited as I am to relive all my childhood memories (read: trauma), I am also not dumb enough to think that this new wave of remake announcements is all sunshine and rainbows. Ideally, we wouldn’t have to be this excited about old games making a comeback, because the new games that are coming out are equally as good, if not better than the classics. And if we aren’t careful as consumers, the success of this venture might indicate to the companies that all we want is more remakes of the same old games instead of moving forward and exploring new possibilities within horror. 
The recent remake announcements came with the announcement of new installments of long-running franchises (such as the new “Silent Hill f”), or similar games that take inspiration from these classics (such as “The Callisto Protocol”). And, as much as the success of the remakes is important, new titles like these are the ones that will truly determine where this genre is headed in the future. As long as the money is there, big studios will probably do it. This isn’t a commentary on corporate greed or anything of the sort; more like financing and business 101. Because studios see that there is a high demand for games like these, they will work to fulfill it and earn profit. 
If these new games are a massive success, incorporating a mixture of return to form and new interesting mechanics, they could dictate a new wave of investment and development of horror in big gaming companies. But if they fail, offering the same lazy game design we have recently so often seen, we will probably have to wait another 10 years before they try again.
Personally, as an unwilling fan of the genre, I’m hoping that these new games that come out are good. And even though their success may eventually lead to another creative slump, just like the great 2000s psychological horror games eventually paved the way for the “walking simulator” hell that we are currently in, I still think it’s worth a shot. Because even after all these years, nothing has come close to scaring me as much as that chainsaw maniac in “Resident Evil 4.” And, as much as I hate to admit it, I’m in desperate need of new nightmare fuel.
