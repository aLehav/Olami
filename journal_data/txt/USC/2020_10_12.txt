As a student from intersectional backgrounds, Mary Fernandez doesn’t feel as though she fits the image of an average USC student. While this may be intimidating for some, Fernandez draws inspiration from her background through her passion for supporting underrepresented communities.
Fernandez, a senior majoring in sociology and American studies, had not always considered herself a leader until she began to work with the Latinx Student Assembly. During her sophomore year, she was appointed secretary and has since continued to serve on the executive board.
“There’s definitely an aspect of my confidence that has been impacted by LSA,” Fernandez said. “LSA gave me a platform. Having those affirmations through LSA has really allowed me to become not just confident, but I would say, a leader who can take risks and is not afraid to take these leaps of faith.”
As secretary, Fernandez also organized an event for LSA that discussed the experiences of incarcerated people and the impact of the prison system, bringing in professors, students and system-impacted individuals.
Fernandez wanted the panel to start a discussion on the impacts of incarceration and make a lasting impact on students and others who attended. Sullyari Bautista, a senior majoring in political science, had attended the panel in support of Fernandez.
“She had various guest speakers come and talk about the way that educational resources play a part in the prison system,” Bautista said. “So, for example, part of the segment was how thankful people are when they’re able to receive books and learn while in prison. During that event she also collected book donations to donate to a juvenile center and so that was a really eye-opening event that discussed the ways that we, we being the Latinx community, can work towards actively supporting people in prisons.”
Bautista and Fernandez first met on El Sol y La Luna Latinx residential floors in Fluor Tower where they were able to be in a strong cultural community together and support each other in the transition to college. Throughout their time at USC, Bautista has seen the dedication Fernandez puts into her work and describes her as “one of the hardest working people” she knows. 
“From her research fellowship to studying abroad in France to the research she’s published, I can directly see how much time and energy she invests into her work,” Bautista said. “I have never been in LSA myself, but I’ve gone to like the meetings that she’s held and it’s always been kind of a full-circle moment. So you see how much hard work she puts into these things, and then you go to these events and see them come together.”
Fernandez’s passion and responsibilities have grown from her secretary position to her current role as assistant director of LSA. She wants to use her position to pay it forward to newer members by giving them the same type of affirmations that past LSA directors gave her as a sophomore. 
“[I want to show other e-board members] what good programming looks like because I think programming is overlooked,” Fernandez said. “If you’re trying to be intentional in your impact and intentional on how you deliver that impact like what methods you’re using, that’s where it becomes complicated. And I guess now my role now as assistant director is not to teach but to contribute and discuss these things with our e-board.”
Another LSA value Fernandez emphasizes is to extend the meaning of community. By doing so, Fernandez hopes to expand LSA’s work past the USC community and into the general South Central community as well. 
This semester, LSA started a political education series, created by director of advocacy Rosa Noriega, where students received a copy of professor Angela Davis’ “Are Prisons Obsolete?” from a Black-owned, woman-owned bookstore called the Reparations Club. While most Undergraudate Student Government assemblies traditionally buy books from Amazon or Office Depot, Fernandez emphasized the importance of “being very deliberate in every step of the way” in supporting the community.
Outside of LSA, Fernandez also founded a cultural community in Kappa Delta Chi Sorority, a Latina-founded sorority dedicated to serving local university communities through volunteer service. The sorority has become a “home away from home” for Fernandez by giving her sisters like Cherise Cayetano, a senior majoring in law, history and culture.
“[Fernandez] likes to make sure everyone is taken care for while upholding our values as well, and it’s very admiring to watch her work in this space,” Cayetano said. “Mary [Fernandez] is honestly one of my best friends, I know I can go to her for any and everything. And you can tell that [her kindness] is so genuine that she truly does care for people.”
During Spring 2020, Cayetano and Fernandez both served on the special projects team for KDChi. After social distancing regulations were put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic, the team had to get creative with planning events while working remotely.
“Mary came up with the idea to do online programming for the entire week and it was really beautiful,” Cayetano said. “Mary literally had a vision and she was like ‘OK, these are the circumstances, we’re going to change it, we’re going to fix it and this is what we’re going to do.’”
KDChi has also given Fernandez the opportunity to work with communities that she values helping, such as C-Youth and C-Hope, a nonprofit organization that provides professional opportunities for previously incarcerated youth or those who come from foster care systems.
Fernandez has also worked closely with the L.A. community through the Mellon Mays Fellowship, an initiative to increase diversity in higher learning by encouraging students in underrepresented groups to pursue doctoral degrees. She has continued to research marginalized communities, such as incarcerated peoples, and makes a point to do so in an ethical way.
“In the past, I’ve looked at how women fit within the discussions around the carceral system. Now, I’m looking at how halfway houses function,” Fernandez said. “While it’s research that maybe is being done, I tend to come at it from an angle of how can I make sure that my methods are as ethical as possible. I don’t want to be an academic who is in contact with the community when it comes to an interview, but then after that they disappear.”
Through Mellon Mays, Fernandez worked with the Boyle Heights Museum, a research project that celebrates the multicultural history of the Boyle Heights neighborhood. The project has allowed her to become more deeply involved within the L.A. community as she interacts with businesses that she wouldn’t know about otherwise.
“[Boyle Heights Museum is] allowing me to know the history of L.A. and the history of L.A. as it pertains to historically marginalized communities which are really important to me, immigrant communities which are really important to me as well,” Fernandez said. “Immediate goals we have [are] to expand the vendor list that USC uses to more stores from Boyle Heights, more businesses.”
Fernandez hopes to connect USC more with other surrounding L.A. communities as a way to address modern day problems in respect to racial dynamics and capitalism. While learning about the Boyle Heights community, Fernandez also draws connections to her own community in Northeast Denver that has been heavily gentrified as well.
“What is happening in Boyle Heights is not exactly what is happening in Denver, but having these things happen before my eyes and seeing similarities and differences [has been] helping [me] find my perspective on the world,” Fernandez said.
Overall, Fernandez’s time and work, both within the USC and South L.A. communities, speak to her passion for supporting underrepresented populations and improving the areas that she is a part of.
“I feel like historically, USC, when they discuss community, they discuss community in terms of the student body, USC students and USC traditional students for that matter,” Fernandez said. “When USC talks about the student community, I don’t think they recognize that every student is different. We have transfer students, like I said, we have first-generation, low-income students. So, [my goal is] not only expanding what community means in terms of USC, but community in terms of the South L.A. community.”

Writing a biweekly column means you’re often a week or two late in getting to write about something the culture has already discarded. But, I think I have a special excuse since I’m writing a biweekly film column in 2020, when there’s not much material to begin with. Around this time, and during a regular year, there would be awards contenders and box office surprises to discuss, but 2020 has forced us to consider our relationship to “the movies” more than to individual films. 
This year, days are all mushed together and draped in sameness. Of course, this is not the best environment for consuming good films — when Netflix is probably the quickest way to pass a good chunk of quarantine time, we are prone to value the act of watching rather than the content. I wrote about giving movies their due during quarantine in my last column. Here I want to take a specific example — Netflix’s “The Social Dilemma” — to show how dangerous it is to watch casually and not critically.  
Netflix released “The Social Dilemma” on Sept. 9, a documentary about the dangers of social media, both the platforms themselves and the giant tech companies behind them. The film features insight from former Silicon Valley employees and founding executives who left their companies due to ethical concerns. Most of them realized that their companies were no longer helping people; many of the interviewees found the opposite to be true. They witnessed their businesses dabble with control, behavior manipulation and addiction but never addressing the destructive consequences their platforms have for users and creators alike. In its arguably most troubling section, the documentary exposes how companies like Google and Facebook profit off of personal information and how they turn their users into products to sell to advertising companies. This is not news, of course, but the way it is expressed in “The Social Dilemma” is revealing. 
“If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product,” Tristan Harris, the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, said in an interview for the film. 
We don’t pay for membership to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter because these companies’ revenue comes from advertisers “bidding” for our attention. The highest bidder gets a split-second of our time; the more we scroll, the more they learn about us, the more information they can present to advertisers, the more money they can make. What’s in it for us? A whole lot of wasted time.
As dramatic as this may seem (and the fictionalized storyline that accompanies the film, I believe, adds unnecessary melodrama), the irony is that this film is on Netflix, a platform that tracks our viewing habits and tailors lists of content we might like “because we watched ‘x.’” And, while the documentary gets into vital points about how our social media is even affecting our mental health and political landscape, germane to this column is how these platforms are trivializing what ought to be revered. 
Twitter demands that we keep scrolling, lest we miss out on the latest comment or meme; the very layout of that site does not promote quiet appreciation or critical thinking on everything we see. Similarly, Netflix’s endless stream of old and new content can foster an attitude of watching for the sake of just getting through your queue. But, strangely enough, no one ever cleans their watchlist. There are masterpieces on Netflix, but we constantly pass them by for the familiar episodes of “The Office” at our disposal. We may never get to the better content on Netflix, Prime or Hulu — or worse, if we do watch great movies, they may be trivialized in the tsunami of content standing by, begging for our attention. 
Case in point: “The Social Dilemma” was released last month, spent some time on the Netflix Top 10 list, was promoted by moms (at least mine) as confirmation of their worst fears for adolescents and quickly faded from view. In 2020, culture moves as quickly as it ever has. Everyone is seeing, posting and moving on to new things with every second of the massive amount of free time we have. I’m talking about this film specifically because I think it is the highest irony that a film about taking “the social dilemma” seriously has been glibly consumed and expelled as a result of that very dilemma it exposes. 
It’s not even that the film is “important” — though I would recommend you watch the documentary and think seriously about the issues it puts forward; technology has a serious effect on our society, but it also affects how we see beauty. When every image on Instagram, every video on YouTube, is valued only in relation to its surroundings, almost never as something appreciable on its own, we become less likely to sit and consider one image at a time. With regard to film, we must cultivate a critical eye, a respect for the form, fighting the currents of trivialization that want us to simply move on to the next thing we might like. How we watch movies, I believe, affects what movies are made. If we seriously demand more from our filmmakers in terms of subject matter, representation, or quality, we are more likely to get what we want. Let’s challenge filmmakers by being critics, every one of us. This might start with rewatching a straightforward (and often cheesy) documentary, or it may mean making a point to watch and rewatch great films and think about them. Whatever your solution may be, you ought to decide soon, before that countdown on the bottom-right corner of the screen hits zero and the next piece of content butts in.

On the brink of reaching the big 4-0, washed-up playwright Radha Blank desperately plans to stage her play in a midlife crisis. Despite winning the theatre’s “30 under 30” award years ago, she lives in a shoebox apartment in Harlem and works as a high school teacher — not the life she dreamed of. However, when her creative frustrations lead to cathartic rapping, she starts to find her own voice again. In full control of her art, writer-director Radha Blank crafts a 40-year-old Black woman’s mixtape in the star-making debut, “The Forty-Year-Old Version.”
From the very first frame, Blank’s vision is clear in the film’s eccentric dialogue, understated performances and killer rhymes. Loosely based on Blank’s own personal struggles as an artist, there is no differentiation between the film’s creator and protagonist. Writer-director Blank simply plays Radha Blank, the “character.” Thus, the film feels less like a fiction and more like a snippet from Blank’s real life. This authenticity is perfectly complemented by the screenplay, which never tries to oversell any character, situation or dialogue. It simply tells the story as it is. This realism creates moments with both absurd humor as well as quiet emotions.
Cinematographer Eric Branco experimented with film stock and color in the film’s stark presentation of Harlem. Other than a few shots of the play, the entire film is presented in a rich, grainy black-and-white palette. The desaturation really frames the artist’s struggling life well. Branco challenges audiences by angling his lens in tight spaces, creating some visually interesting shots. This framing forces viewers to intimately see these characters in private moments. In its rough visuals, the film also effectively introduces Harlem’s underground rap culture. There’s an extremely well-shot scene in particular, where Blank visits a crowded hip-hop battle in a harshly lit club. The celluloid texture and hard lighting adds a vintage quality to the frenetic rapping.
More relevant than anything else, Blank’s depiction of the creative industry is a much-needed perspective in today’s film and theatre scene. As the protagonist struggles to get her play funded, she has to slowly let go of her artistic integrity to the executive producers. The film critiques the liberal white gaze that scrutinizes Black stories and issues. At first, Blank simply wants to tell a story of a young Black couple grappling with the gentrification within Harlem, reflecting the realistic Black experience. However, her producers push her to include ethnic stereotypes, white savior tropes and “poverty porn” to help make her message “universal.” This relevant subtext painfully makes clear of the industry’s need for more Black creators.
Blank leads the film’s mostly unknown cast with tremendous confidence. In a breath of fresh air, the film showcases a plethora of diverse talent on screen with multiple ethnicities, sexualities and religions. In particular, Peter Kim gives an excellent performance as Archie, Blank’s quirky best friend and professional agent. He delivers some of the film’s funniest lines as well as the most heartfelt ones with complete ease. Although, some other supporting characters could have used more development — such as Blank’s rap producer and love interest, D, played by Oswin Benjamin.
In an industry inundated with white male auteurs, ‘The Forty-Year-Old Version’ seems like a necessary dose of change. In depicting the struggling artist’s journey, the film manages to shine a spotlight on its own director. Even with the lo-fi production quality, Blank cements herself as a talent to look out for in the future. In a particularly hard year, this film tells a nuanced story which speaks to anyone seeking to reclaim their voice following tragic circumstances.

Popular culture is a tremendously powerful force, one that has implications for not only its audience but also the world — this is what a recent joint study from nonprofit advocacy organization Define American and The Norman Lear Center at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has found. 
In research that has made significant leaps ahead for the future of popular culture, researchers explored how inclusive and positive portrayals of immigrants are correlated with more inclusive attitudes towards immigrants overall. Titled Change the Narrative, Change the World: How Immigrant Representation on Television Moves Audiences to Action, this research states that the inclusive attitudes fostered by television narratives featuring immigration contributed to viewers re-examining their prejudices surrounding immigrants, becoming inspired to take actions related to immigration and decreasing support for criminalization policies targetting undocumented immigrants. 
To evaluate this study’s implications, it is essential to emphasize the underlying assumption that “representation” is not just an onscreen phenomenon. Because popular culture and politics are interwoven in many ways, empathetic attitudes about immigrants fostered by entertainment must translate to real-life visibility of immigrants. This visibility must manifest beyond the screen for cultural representation to truly make groundbreaking political changes for the immigrant population. 
According to the recently released report, researchers analyzed 129 immigrant characters across 97 episodes of 59 scripted narrative TV shows (airing between August 2018 and July 2019) available on multiple streaming platforms. In addition to analyzing the representations present within those shows, the researchers also looked closely at the viewers of three shows featuring prominent immigration storylines: “Madam Secretary,” “Orange is the New Black” and “Superstore.” As part of the methodology implemented, researchers asked participating viewers about their knowledge of immigration and their likelihood of taking immigration-related actions after watching these television shows. 
In essence, the study illustrates the importance of representation through entertainment, which can serve as a powerful platform for changing cultural perceptions of immigrants. Through nuanced and dynamic renderings of characters and storylines, narrative television shows can inspire viewers to rethink their perceptions of immigrants. In short, though the immigrant experience is not truly quantifiable, representation has the power to inform cultural and societal understandings of immigrants as a diverse group with their own complex stories to tell. 
When considering this research, it is necessary to recognize that while it can be easy for readers to directly conflate positive representation of immigrants with decreases in negative and dehumanizing rhetoric, representation’s positive implications go beyond the ability to shift individual perceptions. Change the Narrative, Change the World encourages us to reflect on the ways in which TV representation can serve as a starting point for immigration reform as a whole. Yet discussions of immigrants and immigration must evolve beyond onscreen representation. 
Representation is not only cultural. Part of its importance comes with tangible change, as representation is key to creating spaces for conversation and dialogue about immigrants and immigration policy in education. Positive conceptions of immigrants do translate into more empathetic attitudes, but it goes without saying that more than empathetic attitudes are necessary to counter the dominant narrative surrounding immigrants. 
This means that on a more sociological level, representation’s impact hinges upon its capacity to produce and sustain substantial, collective change in the real world. Empathy is an immensely powerful tool, as it can produce individual changes in mindset that enable collective shifts in behavior. Yet the most impact comes from channeling empathy into tangible, grassroots action and initiatives for visibility in daily life, which can yield more impactful results than an individual response to representation on a television screen. 
As the research implies, representation is complex and constantly changing. More work still needs to be done, and there is no straightforward conclusion when it comes to the issue of representation. However, it’s clear that when immigrants are represented in nuanced and complex ways — ways that don’t conform to a dominant narrative of criminalization and negative emphasis on an “outsider” status — there is potential for this representation, as a form of education, to have a lasting impact beyond the screen. 
It is for this reason that immigrant representation should not occur solely as a phenomenon on the television screen. Rather, it is essential that immigrants are represented in all aspects of contemporary life: in the textbooks of our education, in politics and in everyday discourse. 
Visibility goes beyond a television storyline. While television can serve as an effective platform to spark these conversations about immigrants, there needs to be an acknowledgment of immigrants who do not appear as a character onscreen and who don’t appear as part of a well-crafted storyline. Immigrants have their own stories, ones that don’t necessarily make it into the cookie-cutter plotline of a television show. When television viewers critically consume narratives about immigrants, they must also channel this understanding of a complex narrative to real-life interactions with immigrants. 
Audiences must support immigrants regardless of whether they are depicted inclusively onscreen. They must actively support immigrants and push for an accurate representation of immigrants not only within a script but also in the realm of daily life. Popular culture does not exist in a vacuum. The sooner viewers take the time to support immigrants offscreen just as much time as they spend time consuming immigrants’ lives onscreen, the sooner that popular culture can yield substantial change beyond the entertainment industry and truly, for the world.

 I am a self-proclaimed hater. I came to this epiphany with about one minute left in Game 5 of this year’s NBA Finals when I found myself on one knee praying to God that Anthony Davis didn’t hit the championship-clinching shot. Before you call me a hater, one, I beat you to it, and two, my prayer wasn’t necessarily directed at Davis. My prayer was directed at the flawed mindset that he represents: the mindset that you have to change locations in order to succeed.
Admittedly, this mindset is valid in a lot of life situations. 
Dangerous circumstances in your home country? Leaving is valid. No room to grow in your job or relationship? Leaving is valid. Don’t think your tuition matches your education? Fight On, and leaving is valid. But the belief that changing locations will bring success isn’t valid in terms of the subjects of this column, basketball and music. Had Davis hit the championship-clinching shot in Game 5, the mindset would’ve been validated at the highest level.
The mindset most notably started with Davis’s teammate LeBron James leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010. Following that one reasonable free agent decision, a parasitic mentality spawned in the minds of every young NBA star: If my team isn’t winning championships, my legacy is being tarnished, and I should join a team where a championship is easier to win.
That mindset is flawed for a few reasons. First, it costs small market teams the opportunity to compete with some of the best players and rosters they will ever have. Just look at the Orlando Magic since Dwight Howard forced his way to the Lakers in 2012; the Magic have had six different head coaches and won more than half their games just once. 
Second, the players worried about their legacy aren’t LeBron James. James has been constantly pitted against the all-time greats since he was a teenager. His ring count matters. It’s the first topic on sports debate shows. It causes grown men to scream to the point of tears in barbershops. No sports show or barbershop is critiquing the legacies of players like Dwight Howard based on championship count. 
Third, and most importantly, success isn’t guaranteed upon departure. In fact, it’s highly unlikely.
Of the dozen or so star players to switch teams in the post-Decision NBA, how many have actually seen their move result in a championship? Not counting James (or Davis as of Sunday night), there have been two: Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, and they both had to join teams that finished first in their conferences the year before they arrived. Stars like Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Howard, Paul George and Kyrie Irving have unsuccessfully employed this mentality on multiple occasions yet young stars continue to follow in their footsteps.
I would love to see a healthy Victor Oladipo lead the Indiana Pacers to contention for the next five years, but reports are already circulating that his time with the Pacers is almost done. Watching Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns finally get it together was one of the top moments of the NBA bubble for me. Other fans want Booker competing for championships immediately, which has led to rumors swirling about his next destination. Speaking of rumors about next destinations, there’s probably a professional-level PhotoShop of Giannis Antetokounmpo in all 29 other NBA teams’ uniforms, despite the Milwaukee Bucks being one of the best teams in the league and Antetokounmpo in the prime of his career. 
Even if players like Antetokounmpo, Booker and Oladipo only win one championship in their respective careers, imagine how much that one ring will mean for their respective franchises. Think about the last time you’ve seen Indiana, Milwaukee or Phoenix hang a championship banner. Unless you’re over 50 years old, you’ve never seen it, and without the Bucks’ 1971 title, no one of any age would have seen those franchises or 11 others as champions.
As frustrating as it is to see this mindset shape the careers of young NBA stars, it’s even more frustrating to see young artists fall victim to the same way of thought.
This doesn’t apply for artists that have connections and sessions waiting for them in a new city. In that instance, leaving is valid. But the mentality that an artist’s hometown doesn’t offer enough and going to a bigger city can help you suddenly blow up makes as much sense as a young basketball star ring chasing. If an artist like The Kid LAROI can become one of the hottest young rappers in the world out of Waterloo, Australia, an artist can make it from anywhere.
For starters, the internet exists. If an artist really wants to connect with another artist, a producer, an A&R or any other individual that can advance their career, they can probably form the connection in less than a handful of Instagram DMs. Branching out to another city when the people closest to you aren’t fully supportive yet is a questionable decision. If the people you grew up with don’t show love to your music, chances are a city of random people won’t either.
But aside from the logic of the decision, my reasoning, or plea, for young artists to stay home and young NBA stars to stick with their team is the same — the success will mean more. Whether it be a LeBron James “Cleveland, this is for you” moment or an Atlanta-esque musical takeover, seeing an overlooked area finally get some glory is one of the best elements of both basketball and music. If the mindset that success can only be achieved through leaving prevails, that special element will be lost.

Adam Sandler has been on a bit of a hot streak. After a string of less-than-tolerable cinematic disasters, including “Jack and Jill,” “The Cobbler” and “The Ridiculous Six,” the Sandman has managed to inject new life into his career. His last comedy, “Murder Mystery,” marked a departure from the lazy toilet humor that bogged down much of his earlier work, and his 2018 stand-up special, “100% Fresh,” was genuinely hysterical. Most recently, Sandler earned critical acclaim for his starring role in the Safdie Brothers’ “Uncut Gems,” where the actor played against type as a selfish New York jeweller-slash-gambling addict.
Following these successes, only one question remained: When would Sandler fly too close to the sun? Certainly, he seemed to be setting himself up for failure. If the Oscars refused to throw him a Best Actor nod, he told radio host Howard Stern back in December he was going to make a terrible film on purpose just to get his revenge. And sure enough, the Academy passed on Sandler for the award. Would his next movie be the one to send him crashing back down to Earth? Well, maybe only halfway. 
While “Hubie Halloween” doesn’t reach the nostalgic highs of a “Happy Gilmore,” it certainly doesn’t fall to the cringeworthy lows of a “Grown Ups 2.” Netflix’s new Halloween comedy sees Sandler break out a freshly ridiculous accent to portray Salem, Mass.’ local dullard Hubie Dubois. Descended from a woman executed during the Salem witch trials, Hubie has only one goal in life: to make sure that everyone in his town stays safe on Halloween night. When trick-or-treaters begin to go missing, Hubie will need help from all of Sandler’s typical co-stars to solve the case.
It’s a lighthearted story that’s predictably short on scares and narrative cohesion, but it’s hard to resist Sandler’s trademark charm as he stumbles his way from one awkward social interaction to the next. The film’s revolving door of comic powerhouses, including Kevin James, Maya Rudolph, Kenan Thompson and even Shaquille O’Neal, all play off Hubie’s manic energy nicely. And of course, Steve Buscemi shows up to give the world his best werewolf impression.
But how much you enjoy this film depends entirely on how you feel about Sandler’s particular form of low-brow comedy. His trademark toilet humor is back in full force — at least three characters soil themselves — and he expects plenty of laughs from the countless slapstick gags littered throughout the film. These jokes have just enough creative punch, though, to keep from getting stale. It’s truly remarkable to see Sandler swing from a tree using a grappling hook that shoots out of his thermos, or vacuuming broken glass with his thermos or protecting himself from an angry mob of middle schoolers aiming their lunches at his head by opening an umbrella out of his thermos — seriously, his thermos is magic. It’s these kinds of silly details that save the film and harken back to Sandler’s less offensive work in the early 2000s. 
The film fails, however, to present a particularly compelling story. At this point in Sandler’s career, no one expects a masterpiece, but it’s fair to hope for at least a lick of suspense, even considering the film’s ridiculous premise. But alas, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Key suspects are brushed aside as red herrings before they have a chance to shine, romantic tensions are fabricated out of thin air and subplots come and go with little regard for narrative structure. 
The creative team behind “Hubie Halloween” does deserve credit for attempting to push a positive message after a rather brilliant comic twist at the film’s climax. But after expecting audiences to laugh at Hubie’s torment throughout the film, an anti-bullying plea strikes a false chord. Seriously, the bullies in this film are vicious, and Hubie is so kindhearted that their actions feel nothing short of cruel. 
Ultimately, the film does just enough to satisfy Sandler fans like myself, but it probably won’t do anything to win over his critics. It’s a goofy, lighthearted adventure that doesn’t take itself too seriously and makes for an easy watch despite its many flaws. Even if you can’t laugh at Sandler’s jokes, you can laugh with your friends as you make fun of Hubie’s ridiculous accent and the film’s countless inconsistencies.

Although my awareness of the passage of time has admittedly been off since March, it is hard to forget that the presidential election is less than a month away. With issues such as the coronavirus, a Supreme Court nomination, racial justice and climate change on the ballot, I am glued to my phone, inevitably distracted by the breaking news that occurs daily. 
To say there is a lot at stake is an understatement. Knowing this, elections must accurately and transparently reflect and represent voters. One of the first steps to ensuring this is to take the “dark money” filtered through nonprofits out of elections. 
When 501(c)(4) nonprofits spend money for political purposes, they do not have to publicly disclose their donors’ identities. Under campaign finance law, this kind of anonymous spending is perfectly legal and known as “dark money.” The ruling in the 2010 Supreme Court case Citizens United v. FEC opened the floodgates for dark money. In that ruling, the Court claimed that to limit “independent political spending” of businesses and other organizations was a limit of the First Amendment’s right to free speech. 
This ruling led to the rise of super political action committees, which are organizations that can raise unlimited funds from individuals, corporations or nonprofits to campaign on behalf of a candidate. While super PACs technically have to disclose their donors, 501(c)(4) nonprofits do not, meaning super PACs can receive anonymous donations if it goes through a nonprofit first. 
In an effort to stop the sudden influx of dark money, the IRS states that politics cannot be the main purpose of nonprofits if they wish to keep donors anonymous. However, the rules are easy to get around and hardly ever enforced. As a result, in the current system, super PACs receive hundreds of millions of unidentified dollars through nonprofits and use this money to actively campaign for a certain candidate, so long as they are not directly coordinating with that candidate. 
By 2014, a mere four years after the Citizens United decision, only 29% of outside spending on state and local campaigns was fully disclosed. In 2016, dark money groups spent almost $181 million in the presidential election. Last month, spending by dark money groups surpassed the $1 billion mark. 
Dark money gives billionaires, powerful lobbyists and even foreign entities unchecked and undue influence over the very elections meant to be key to the democratic process.
In the 2016 election, branches of the National Rifle Association labeled as 501(c)(4) nonprofits spent more than $30 million in support of President Donald Trump. In 2017 alone, the NRA had $378 million worth of dark money. We have no way of knowing where that money came from and whom representatives are serving when they refuse to pass gun control legislation. 
In 2018, Soviet businessmen Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas were indicted for laundering over $1 million from foreign countries through a shell corporation to a pro-Trump super PAC. With current campaign finance laws and the lack of accountability on the part of dark money groups, interference in United States elections from foreign donors is an all too likely reality. 
An anonymous $750,000 donation was given to a third-party group in Wisconsin that supported Gov. Scott Walker in his recall election in 2012. Once Walker won the election, the Republican-controlled legislature quickly changed the state law to make it more difficult for those who suffered adverse effects from lead-paint poisoning to sue lead paint manufacturers. This sudden change in law seems random, right? Well, in 2016, The Guardian leaked documents that disclosed the donor’s identity. The $750,000 was given by Harold Simmons, owner of NL Industries, one of the most historic lead paint manufacturers. 
Dark money isn’t unique to one party, however. In the 2018 midterm elections, a study by the government reform group Issue One found that politically active nonprofits spent $150 million worth of dark money, with Democratic-leaning groups accounting for 54% of it.  
While the Democratic National Committee adopted a platform last month calling for a ban of dark money, there is doubt whether Democrats, if given the chance, will destroy the very system that enormously funds their campaigns. 
There is no law in place that prohibits candidates’ former campaign managers and chiefs of staff from running super PACs and advocating for the very same candidates they used to work under. If former staff members are running these organizations, they know the donors. Therefore, it isn’t a leap to assume the candidates they support and used to work for also have knowledge of these donors’ identities. In that way, candidates may know exactly who they need to repay, while the American people are left in the dark. 
Dark money directly inhibits our ability to hold our leaders accountable and creates a veil of secrecy over a process that desperately needs transparency. Political social welfare nonprofits should not be exempt from disclosing donors. We have enough things to worry about this upcoming election — hundreds of millions of dollars of anonymous money infiltrating our political system should not be one of them.

There is less than one month until the start of the 2020 USC football season, and the position battles are beginning to heat up. 
The Trojans officially began practice Friday to kick off a three-week training camp ahead of their first game Nov. 7. One of the biggest challenges this season is how the coaching staff will deal with training camp during the middle of the academic semester. 
“Usually you have a limited amount of time during a training camp because it’s over the summer,” head coach Clay Helton said. “But now we’re on a 20-hour-care work week, and we have to work around school.”
Helton and his staff are responsible for figuring out how to best utilize the 20 hours per week designated for practicing. Practices must be no more than four hours a day, and the Trojans have decided their daily practice slots will be from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. 
Helton provided a lengthy list of injury updates to the media in a virtual press conference Friday. Two major blows for the Trojans this season are the losses of redshirt senior linebacker Jordan Iosefa and redshirt sophomore linebacker Solomon Tuliaupupu, both out indefinitely with knee injuries. Redshirt sophomore linebacker Eli’jah Winston is also out with an ankle injury.
Iosefa, who missed the 2019 season with a dislocated kneecap, played an imperative role on the defensive end in 2018. Former four-star recruit Tuliaupupu, on the other hand, has yet to make his debut with the Trojans. Winston was key to USC’s outside linebacker depth last season.
This leaves the Trojans thin in the linebacker group. Helton said this gives other players the opportunity to step up, specifically mentioning sophomore Ralen Goforth and redshirt freshman Tuasivi Nomura. 
“There’s still some really, really quality players,” Helton said. “We’ve got men there [at linebacker].”
Redshirt freshmen wide receiver Kyle Ford and tight end Ethan Rae are also injured, Helton said. Ford is out with a torn ACL and Rae had knee surgery. Sophomore receiver Munir McClain is also suspended from team activities, according to Helton, who did not specify the reason for the suspension. 
Redshirt junior offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker, who initially opted out of the season, has decided to play this year, he announced last week. He is a leading candidate to fill in at left tackle to protect the blindside of sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis. 
The Trojans’ offensive line did lose Austin Jackson to the NFL after the 2019 season, a key pass blocker and veteran presence on offensive line coach Tim Drevno’s group. Jackson’s departure opens up more time for the six freshmen offensive linemen signed last season. However, the Trojans still have great experience up front. 
“When you look at Alijah Vera-Tucker, [redshirt juniors] Jalen McKenzie, Andrew Vorhees, Brett Neilon and [redshirt senior] Liam Jimmons, they’ve all had that,” Helton said. “They’ve all had that experience.”
Not lost on the Trojans is the importance of maintaining and following health and safety protocols at all times. Helton mentioned the coaching staff needs to keep the team ready on all levels as contributions may be needed from further down the depth chart than usual. 
“It’s really going to be important for us to grow this team from the bottom up, not only because of injuries, but because all of a sudden you can have a positive test and that next guy is up like that,” Helton said. “We’re gonna have to train them [six freshmen] like they’re getting ready to go start a game, because they could.”
The Trojans have a short timeline until their first game against Arizona State Nov. 7. It will be tricky for the coaching staff to figure out how to best prepare the team, especially with changes on the staff including the addition of new defensive coordinator Todd Orlando.
Junior safety Talanoa Hufanga highlighted the energy Orlando brings to practice and how enjoyable it has been to work with him. 
“We’ve definitely put a whole new system in and we’re trying to learn as much as we can,” Hufanga said. “You try to absorb everything and take it and run.”
Another challenge for USC is that the first game of the season kicks off at an early start time of 9 a.m. Helton mentioned he will look to use weekends for earlier practices as a way to help get players prepared. Helton also said going out on the Coliseum field early in the morning is imperative to get players familiar with that experience. 
“As we draw closer to the game, we are going to do some things in the early morning to allow us to get them acclimated,” Helton said. “As well as take some opportunities on weekends to be able to get some work — not only at the time we’re going to play in that opening game but also to be in the Coliseum at that particular time.”
With less than four weeks remaining until the season opener, it’ll be crucial for contributors on offense, defense and special teams to become familiar with the abnormal stadium environment quickly. Slovis said he has been working with the offensive line on snap counts to throw defensive players off in an effort to use an empty stadium to their advantage.
Friday was the first time the team scrimmaged since March and adjustments are going to be made rapidly. 
“We got to dial in on [tackling] as fast as possible and be able to make our skills as best as possible when it comes down to the game,” Hufanga said.
