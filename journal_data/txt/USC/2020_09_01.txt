USC’s football and men’s water polo teams will be kept out of action a while longer.
Workouts for the two sports have been paused until at least Sept. 8 pending the results of two rounds of testing: one Monday and one this upcoming Friday, according to an Athletic Department press release Tuesday.
One more student-athlete tested positive in a round conducted last Friday, bringing the total to nine positive cases between the two teams. All student-athletes who tested positive were isolated.
The Athletic Department had initially announced Aug. 26 that workouts would be paused for at least the next five days after the first eight of those positives had been identified through the then-weekly surveillance testing program. The most recent announcement means that the teams will have at minimum 13 total days away from team activities.
According to the first press release announcing the eight positive cases and reiterated by Monday’s announcement, contact tracing suggests that the virus came from off-campus activity amid a spike in the USC community as the fall semester began, and not as a result of on-campus activities or team training.
One hundred and twenty-five students tested positive for the coronavirus at USC Student Health in the most recently weekly total, between Aug. 23 and 29.
All USC workouts have taken place outdoors and without contact, as directed by Pac-12 Conference and public health guidelines.
Athletic Director Mike Bohn expressed confidence in the department’s “effective mitigation strategies” in the Aug. 26 press release.
USC has also altered its testing policy, according to Monday’s release, as it will now test all student-athletes twice per week compared to the original once per week schedule.
“USC Athletics will continue its stringent required daily mitigation protocols for all student-athletes who currently work out on campus, including completing symptom questionnaires, undergoing temperature checks, wearing face coverings, practicing physical distancing and sanitizing hands,” Monday’s press release read.
The three phases of USC’s return-to-campus plan involved football and men’s water polo as well as men’s and women’s basketball, women’s soccer and women’s volleyball. Workouts for the latter sports remain unaffected.
Between mid-June — when USC began testing student-athletes working out on campus from any of those six sports — and Friday, 16 student-athletes tested positive for the coronavirus out of 1,127 tests conducted.

On Aug. 29, 1970, East Los Angeles was flooded by tens of thousands of young Mexican Americans part of the Chicano Movement. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of what is now known as the Chicano Moratorium, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Aug. 29 hosted a virtual screening of the documentary “Rubén Salazar: Man in the Middle” and a live Q&A with a panel featuring filmmaker Phillip Rodriguez and leading Mexican American journalists, educators and activists. 
The viewing was part of the Rubén Salazar/Chicano Moratorium campaign created by Rodriguez alongside media, community sponsors and educational partners. It seeks to encourage discussions surrounding bias and racial inequality in news coverage and how this event is significant to the Latinx community and its history. 
Fifty years ago, following increased tensions between the Chicanx community and the Los Angeles Police Department, students and young activists alike took to the streets to protest the Vietnam War. Latino men were observed dying at a higher rate compared to the majority population in the war, making people in the Chicanx community concerned over the disproportional risk faced by Latinx soldiers.  
These protests represent many different things for the Mexican American community in L.A. For one, it commemorates the tragic death of former Los Angeles Times reporter and KMEX news director Rubén Salazar. 
Known for his news reporting on Latin America and the unrest in Mexico during the late 1960s, Salazar became further intertwined with the Chicanx community by joining KMEX, a Spanish language television station in L.A. 
However, despite the Chicano Moratorium’s protests calling for the end of brutality toward Mexican Americans, Salazar was killed that day by LAPD Sheriff’s Deputy Thomas Wilson. Salazar had taken shelter after police released tear gas into Laguna Park and escalated violence at the protest. Wilson had fired tear gas into the Silver Dollar Cafe, where Salazar had taken refuge. While others in the building fled after the tear gas had entered the cafe, Salazar was fatally struck by the canister.
Salazar’s death sparked further protests and the legacy of his work is immortalized in the 2014 award-winning documentary “Rubén Salazar: Man in the Middle.” 
The documentary showcases Salazar’s story, his Mexican heritage and transformation from a run-of-the-mill reporter to a staunch supporter and chronicler of the Chicano Movement of the 1960s and 70s. It captures the enormous impact his life and death had on the Mexican American civil rights movement and modern social justice movements. 
Rodriguez wanted to make “Rubén Salazar: Man in the Middle” because he saw something in Salazar’s story that piqued his curiosity, he said. He tried to dig deeper into mysterious circumstances surrounding Salazar’s death but soon found a more familiar story in the working-class man’s life.
“I set out to make a film certainly drawn by the glamour, by the noir, the glamour of his mysterious demise,” Rodriguez said. “But as I delve into it I realized he was a human being much like my parents, the silent generation of Mexican Americans, all but forgotten in terms of history and media product. I found a lot of appeal, glamour in his very ordinary, mid-century Mexican American identity.” 
He also saw value in bringing to light the suspicious events surrounding Salazar’s death and what his passing represented for the community. 
“I understood also I had an opportunity to bring up the facts of his death,” Rodriguez said. “It’s a bit of a paradox, that the big name that got killed at that event was not a Chicano American ‘rabble-rouser’ throwing a Molotov cocktail or an activist, but the middle-class guy.” 
The 50th anniversary and its message for equality and the elimination of police brutality remain relevant amid the Black Lives Matter Movement, which has garnered mainstream media attention since the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless others. 
Panelist and Los Angeles Times reporter Daniel Hernandez said, “From my observation, historically, Latinos have indeed often and frequently throughout history looked to African American models of resistance, we’ve looked to African American leaders.”
While the Black and Chicanx communities’ needs are not the same, each movement’s messages are intertwined in similar desires for increased protection and an end to systemic oppression.
“I think historically that there is a sense of deference and cooperation with Black leadership in the history of the United States,” Hernández said. “But I think there is opportunity to further advance the kinds of coalitions that have been taking place there, while also serving and focusing on the concentrations of each individual community as well.”
While the issues of oppression and racism that persisted in Salazar’s life exist now, many of those within the Chicanx community are looking toward the future for more ways to spread the demand for racial justice, which include diversity in media and reporting.
“I think what we can learn from the period of time in the ’70s, and specifically from Rubén Salazar, is that… we just need more voices,” panelist and co-founder of Mijente, an organization focused on providing political and social resources for the Latinx community, Neidi Dominguez said. “But we don’t have enough diverse voices to really reflect the impact that [coronavirus and police brutality] is having in our communities.”

Health and the humanities have historically been considered disparate subjects. Yet amid a pandemic, it is essential to recognize the benefits that a humanistic understanding of public health can bring to USC. Applying the humanities to health is an integral approach to education that recognizes the humanities as a platform for empathy, a skill that is especially necessary — and often overlooked — in technical aspects of medical training. 
Felicity Callard, professor of human geography at the University of Glasgow, recently researched the role of storytelling during the coronavirus pandemic. According to her research published in Somatosphere, a digital scholarly platform covering medical anthropology and other interdisciplinary subjects in the sciences, the absence of precise and accurate language to describe the symptoms and experiences of the coronavirus, or what Callard describes as “narrative anchors,” contributed to greater confusion and feelings of isolation for those affected by it. Within the context of the study, Callard stressed the need for comprehensive narratives of illness in policy decisions about issues of public health. 
Given the University’s overarching principle of the interdisciplinary “Renaissance Ideal,” an academic philosophy that encourages students to pursue a variety of subjects, USC is no stranger to the intersection of health and the humanities. The Keck School of Medicine of USC, for example, boasts a one-year master’s program in Narrative Medicine that aims to foster an innovative curriculum centered around the intersection of narrative storytelling and practical experience in the healthcare system. 
“Global Narratives of Illness and Disability,” an undergraduate course offered by the University’s French department, is an especially relevant class in light of the pandemic. Although the course advertises itself as one focused explicitly on narratives in the French-speaking world, it is only an example of the academic potential that the literary intersection of storytelling and illness offers. USC’s academic departments can take this thematic intersection into consideration when deciding relevant offerings for future courses.  
In terms of student organizations, The Healing Process is a USC-based literary publication funded by the Levan Institute of Humanities and Ethics that publishes artistic work related to experiences of health, medicine and wellness. In its mission statement, the editors write that the goal of the digital magazine is to emphasize the “human aspect of healing.” 
All these endeavors demonstrate the University’s recognition of the importance of addressing public health and the humanities together in an educational format. In order to effectively understand the current chaotic state of the world, it is necessary to look to the past and how art and writing have historically helped us respond to global crises. 
However, interdisciplinary thinking about health and the humanities should not be limited to specialized programs or courses. Instead, such a framework should be applied to all classes and opportunities, regardless of their overall focus or emphasis.
Writing has long been considered therapeutic. English and creative writing classes can emphasize the practice of writing about health in the context of national and global coronavirus developments. Through this guiding concept, students can better articulate their concerns about living in a worldwide pandemic and, in turn, have a platform to process and move forward in an adaptive fashion.
In an academic environment, students should be encouraged to address their thoughts and perspectives about the ongoing pandemic. Curriculums should not skim over or dismiss the palpable effects the coronavirus has on students; rather, they should seek to incorporate these realities into their learning experiences as effectively as possible.
In addition, cinema and media studies classes can develop specialized seminars on how public health has been historically depicted through film. As a supplement to necessary medical training, lab courses can offer readings on the history and literature of the background of their experiments and topics studied. Instead of considering how to best implement regular club activities online, student organizations, which are first and foremost spaces for community, ought to provide platforms for open dialogue about experiences during the pandemic. This is especially important for those who are struggling to connect with others during this time. 
USC has long prided itself on its interdisciplinary education. With a more comprehensive and overarching framework dedicated to the intersection of health and the humanities, the University can demonstrate that its interdisciplinary emphasis — incorporated within all fields (even those not on campus) — is more critical than ever during a pandemic.

A buzz of anticipation and expectation surrounding this year’s MTV Video Music Awards was felt by fans behind their screens everywhere. One of the most-awaited nights in music took place Sunday, and this year it aimed for something even more spectacular than ever before: The VMAs treated audiences to a full-scale awards show in the middle of a pandemic. Live performances took place on top of New York skyscrapers, at drive-in theatres in Brooklyn and some were even broadcast live from across the world. And it was beautiful. 
Television personality and actress Keke Palmer was the perfect host for a celebration that honored life, music and speaking up against injustice, mixing her experience, activism and comedic persona. As the first Black woman to host the VMAs, Palmer addressed the Black Lives Matter movement’s power, saying, “We’ve seen our generation step up, take to the streets and make sure our voices will be heard.”
Palmer also discussed the importance of speaking out against injustice and using music’s power to heal. Her speech was followed by cheers from what sounded like a live audience. Still, viewers never saw whether it was a group of fans behind the cameras or if their cheers were digitally added. Behind the host, an enormous digital stage was designed to make the experience feel as realistic as possible — there were even simulations of fans standing and cheering in booths. 
The Weeknd kicked off the festivities with a performance of his hit single “Blinding Lights,” which later won him Video of the Year. As he belted the lyrics to the song from the top of Edge at Hudson Yards, viewers could see the New York City skyline’s backdrop. Surrounded by flashing lights, helicopters and fireworks, MTV really pushed the boundaries for this event. 
Although there was no recipient for the Video Vanguard Award this year, MTV introduced the first-ever inaugural MTV Tricon Award to the star of the night: Lady Gaga, a singer, actress, dancer, designer and activist. MTV explained that the award “is in recognition of her talents as a global music superstar, award-winning actor and undisputed fashion icon.”
Besides being the queen of the night, Gaga stood out as she was one of the only artists to wear a mask at all times — even when singing and dancing throughout her performance of songs from “Chromatica,” which included her collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Rain On Me.” Accustomed to using awards shows for major fashion statements, Gaga continued to serve unique looks and incorporate masks within them. Some covered the whole face, others involved horns, and for her performance, it seems like she had created an electronic system within the mask that would better enable her to sing. “I might sound like a broken record, but wear a mask. It’s a sign of respect,” Gaga said.
For each acceptance, Best Collaboration (“Rain On Me” ft. Ariana Grande), Song of the Year (“Rain on Me” ft. Ariana Grande) and Artist of Year, Lady Gaga continuously thanked her fans and urged them to never give up on their dreams. “I want nothing more than to be your artist in 2020,” she remarked in one of her speeches.
The VMAs have always stood as a celebration of music. Many of the performers and nominees were popular on TikTok over the summer. DaBaby’s “Rockstar,” Doja Cat’s “Say So” and Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” were all hits of the night, with Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion bringing awards home for Best New Artist and Best Hip-Hop, respectively. 
Filled with a blast of international music, Maluma, CNCO and BTS took to the stage. As South Korean pop phenomenon BTS performed its new hit “Dynamite,” the Latinx performers CNCO and Maluma did so on a drive-in stage in Brooklyn. 
Although the night was filled with excitement and happiness, The Weeknd shared some of the heartache felt this year. In his acceptance speeches, the singer said that it’s hard to celebrate the night and asked for justice for Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake. Likewise, before the show’s opening, Keke Palmer shared some thoughtful words about the loss of actor Chadwick Boseman. “We dedicate tonight’s show to a man whose spirit touched so many,” Palmer said. “He is a true hero, not just on screen but in everything he did. His impact lives forever.”
Other great performances of the night included Miley Cyrus, the Black Eyed Peas and DaBaby. Cyrus and the Black Eyed Peas surprised audiences by adding a little nostalgia to their performances. Cyrus rode a glittery disco ball, which reminisces her “Wrecking Ball” era and the Black Eyed Peas performed their 2009 hit “I Gotta Feeling.” Following rumors of possible surprise appearances, viewers were disappointed by the absence of artists such as Harry Styles, Dua Lipa and Justin Bieber (although Bieber did receive Best Music Video From Home for “Stuck With U” ft. Ariana Grande). 
The MTV VMAs achieved the impossible and conducted a massive production while following health and safety guidelines. To introduce categories, presenters Bella Hadid, Joey King, Drew Barrymore, Jaden Smith and many others stood on stage alone and moved aside when the winners would give their speeches. It is speculated, however, that some of these introductions were pre-recorded and that the event was not an entirely live performance. It was clear to see the importance of social distancing on stage and backstage. In between breaks, viewers were shown a significantly small number of crew members shuffling between acts, always wearing face coverings. 
Sunday night was a success, not only bringing joy to people’s homes but also being an example of innovation during the challenges presented by the pandemic. MTV showed the world that it is still possible to carry on with one of music’s biggest nights while remaining mindful.

Last week, Provost Charles Zukoski announced that Keck School of Medicine Dean Laura Mosqueda would be stepping down from her position to help drive “efforts to expand and advance geriatrics at the University.” 
I had the opportunity to hear from the Keck dean during the early stages of USC’s response to the coronavirus pandemic last semester, when she gave a presentation to my “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being” class. 
Mosqueda reassured us over Zoom of the University’s then-newly implemented safety protocols and wished us a safe conclusion of the spring semester, albeit virtually, encouraging the importance of well-being when adapting to a new learning or work environment. 
Being a second-semester freshman and having had my year cut short by the pandemic, her sentiments deeply resonated with me. However, I felt thankful that I had the opportunity to hear from a role model about her work in a field that I hold so close to my heart. 
For many USC students, that presentation may have been the first time the word “geriatrics” crossed their mind. Gerontology, in short, is the study of older adults and all facets of aging across the lifespan. But did you also know that the University actually has its own college dedicated to just that? In fact, that very college has entire programs dedicated to gerontology for undergraduates, post-doctoral students and everyone in between.
If you’ve ever had the chance to swing by the corner of campus near Parkside International Residential College and the Viterbi School of Engineering, you may have noticed a strange-looking building with a cute little fountain and some transparent glass walls.
You probably wondered, “Huh, this is probably part of Dornsife or something like that — maybe even Viterbi.” Or, quite frankly, you probably didn’t think much about it at all and just continued on your way, concerning yourself with more important things on your agenda. Nonetheless, that building was the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology in all four floors of its glory. Rivaling Dornsife with a less than 1% admissions distribution for undergraduates in the 2023 class, the Leonard Davis School hosts one of the smallest undergraduate populations in the University. 
However, what we lack in numbers, we make up for by popularizing and amplifying gerontology in the world of academia. I always like to say that our school of gerontology is the best in the world, to which I am often met with the response that we‘re the only gerontology school in the world. While that’s certainly a topic for another time, there are plenty of other reputable gerontology programs and departments around the world (I’m looking at you, UCLA). 
Yet our faculty and staff continue to push the boundaries in the field of aging, from perfecting the online curriculum in the development of the first online gerontology degree program to drastically improving the lives of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s through world-class research. 
Gerontology is a fairly new and young field — ironic, I know — and a long ways away from being a well-known area of specialization in the medical field. That being said, the world’s older population is rapidly growing, with the National Institutes of Health predicting more than 1.6 billion older adults by the year 2050 — more than 17% of the world’s population. Significant advances in remote telemedicine, health promotion and preventative care all contribute to the increasing population of older adults. 
In an interview with the Leonard Davis School last year, Mosqueda perfectly described the core of geriatric medicine and gerontology. “Geriatrics is not what you think of when you think of a heroic specialty. So it just doesn’t have the same kind of oomph and excitement that other specialties do,” she said. “But once you get in there, and you do some house calls, and you meet people who are 90 to 100 years old and hear their stories. For me, that’s very inspiring.”
It is exactly this — sharing lessons and stories of the past along with caring for some of the most vulnerable individuals of our society today — that is the heart and soul of gerontology. There really isn’t anything glorious or romantic about it — I mean, you tell me the last time you saw a geriatrician on a hospital soap opera (with the exception of George Shannon, an associate professor in gerontology who starred in such hits as “General Hospital” and “The Young and the Restless”). 
On that note, studying aging doesn’t necessarily have to revolve around physical changes to the body; we also evaluate social work and public policies that concern the lives of older adults. There’s so much to learn and understand about the later stages of the human lifespan, not only to benefit today’s group of older adults but also to set the foundation of what older age will or should look like for generations to come. 
We work to understand the changes that the human body goes through with the goal of tracking and identifying ways to make the later stages of life even just a tad better than it was for previous generations. Especially now amid the coronavirus pandemic, gerontology has become a medical focal point as governments and facilities try to find new ways to assist older adults now physically distancing from loved ones and coping with social isolation. 
From tackling ageist microaggressions to understanding how we can help older adults in the coronavirus era, this column will highlight some of the advice from gerontology faculty, researchers and students studying all things to do with aging. 
Now, as I aspire to be an inspirational geriatrician like Mosqueda, I took up the challenge of writing this column to spread awareness about older adults and the challenges they face today in the digital age. Back in their day, life looked very different than how it does now and, likewise, the future will have changed drastically from what we consider to be the norm by the time we hit our later stages in life — so much so that we’ll be looking at the world around us, saying “back in my day…”

With a closet full of shirts and an idea in 2018, Calvin Chen and Brendan Mullen beat the clock and founded a fashion rentals brand startup to help young professionals make a statement in the City of Angels. Both juniors majoring in business administration launched a startup called Rent-A-Fit, making high-end fashion more sustainable and affordable for students and budding professionals. Now, they couldn’t be more excited to see their project begin its initial launch.
Rent-A Fit offers clients an affordable alternative to expensive name brands. Renters pay a $5 monthly subscription fee for access to the latest clothing trends and the ability to take items from Rent-A-Fit’s luxury inventory home for a three- or six-day period. The company, which has over 500 subscribers, offers full dry-cleaning services and members can buy their rentals at a discount at the end of each fashion season.
Starting their business model as freshman roommates, Chen and Mullen worked tirelessly on their plan throughout their freshman year. Chen said that he sometimes needed to sacrifice class periods to meet with key investors, and Mullen said the pair worked on their final project daily. 
With the help of USC resources such as the Marshall Incubator Program at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, the pair reached out to Marshall mentors such as professor Marianne Szymanski and alumni investors. While maintaining a busy school schedule, their first inventory came from Chen’s closet, and they worked long into the night creating online platform tools and learning about previous rental business models as freshmen.
“When we first started this company, we had no idea what we were doing,” Chen said. “We’ve never done a tech startup team before. And that’s kind of where I’ve been fortunate enough to go to USC, and USC really played a big role in helping us grow this business.”
In 2018 the pair met with more than 30 USC business professors and professionals like Director of the USC Incubator Program Paul Orlando, who advised and connected them with other professionals. Chen and Mullen both said that they are responsible for angel investors’ money — today Rent-A-Fit has raised $100,000 in fundraising and the company is valued at $2.5 million. Rent-A-Fit team members said they are determined to put this startup funding to good use.
“It really just came down to putting in the time, the grind and effort, really into making it successful,” Mullen said. “We would just work every single day on building our business plan, establishing our model, looking at projections, sourcing out products [and] developing our website.” 
Risks in starting a new enterprise kept the team on track. Rent-A-Fit founders said that time is their most valuable resource when building their brand since starting a business in college is difficult. 
“Now that I am responsible for investors’ money, it really changes your perspective,” Mullen said. “I want to work as hard as possible to ensure that they will have a gain on their investment down the road.” 
Mullen said he doesn’t want to waste any time with an opportunity like Rent-A-Fit. 
Taking Szymanski’s Management of New Enterprises course allowed Chen and Mullen to apply their ideas in the classroom and gain mentors along the way.
“We didn’t have any experience right away,” Mullen said. “We knew we had a great idea we were sitting on. We wanted to go about it the right way.”
Under Szymanski’s guidance, Chen and Mullen learned what it takes to become an entrepreneur. Szymanski stressed that students need the discipline to excel in Marshall startup courses and beyond. She also recommended that students interested in small business development take Entrepreneurship of the Toy Industry, a two-unit course that follows the business models of popular toy brands like Hasbro and Mattel. 
“The minute you walk in my [classroom] door, you’ve already told me, ‘I want to be an entrepreneur’ and have a business idea,” Szymanski said. “It could just be a sketch on a paper, but you will really focus on yourself and how to apply yourself to the situation of running a business.”  
Szymanski said she is excited to see her students succeed in the fashion industry. 
“I think those two students had a huge amount of [mindset and entrepreneurial spirit] that they were very good at sharing ideas about their business, participating [and] encouraging other students to learn about their ideas,” Szymanski said. “The presentation was great and they were very motivated and extremely passionate about clothing.”
Earlier this year, the duo asked Emma Marcussen, a sophomore majoring in business administration, to join their team. Marcussen helps develop the brand’s online platforms and has recently worked on building brand recognizability for Rent-A-Fit.
“What is really cool about being a part of this venture, while we’re all still in school, is that we can use what we’ve learned from USC and within Marshall and then test it out in real-life situations,” Marcussen said.
Now more than ever, consumers consider alternatives to purchasing high-end products for both financial and environmental reasons. Fast fashion is one of the leading causes of landfill waste, and renting represents a sustainable alternative for any occasion.
“This idea is really relevant for people who still want to experience luxury without committing and paying the big-ticket price,” Marcussen said. “On a sustainability level, I think Rent-A-Fit is such a great option for people to be able to try this out, you know, wear it a couple of times and send it back without having it sit in their closet for months and never wearing it.” 
The trio agree that renting is the business of the future. Chen said that post-pandemic fashion is already changing for the better. With the economic downturn, fashionistas are more conscious about their spending and are looking for alternatives to fast fashion — and Rent-A-Fit has just the answer for this change.
“The last year or so, the whole renting revolution trend has become very popular,” Mullen said. “And I think for us, with minimal competition in our specific niche — which is a luxury good phase — has an incredible opportunity to grow.”

When the Los Angeles Lakers traded for Anthony Davis last summer, the team immediately became a popular championship pick, boasting the second best Vegas odds to win the title.
The Lakers were well on track to the championship in March, winning 24 of their first 27 games with the help of recent signees Danny Green and Dwight Howard.
Since July’s NBA restart, though, things haven’t been so sweet for L.A. Sure, the Lakers were able to coast through their eight “seeding games” to finish off the regular season and hold on to the first seed in the West, but they’ve lost more than they’ve gained during the four-month hiatus and are now in jeopardy of a second round exit to the Houston Rockets. 
The Lakers had several things going for them in mid-March when the pandemic brought the world of sports to a halt. They had great team chemistry, a fully healthy roster and lots of momentum coming off big wins against the Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Clippers — the NBA’s first and third best regular season teams at that point — in the final weekend before the shutdown. 
Now, the Lakers have lost the important perimeter defender Avery Bradley and Rajon Rondo, a key playmaker and leader off the bench. Home court advantage is no longer relevant in the Orlando bubble, and almost every other team has showed up at full strength. In their seeding games, the Lakers looked out of sync as they weren’t able to buy a 3-pointer and had statistically one of the worst offenses of all the teams in the bubble, ranking near the bottom of the league in 3-point shooting.
In their first round matchup, the Portland Trail Blazers posed a very real threat to the Lakers, showing up to Orlando with a healthy roster that had missed key components during the regular season. However, the Lakers easily handled a scorching hot Portland squad in five games. 
Heading into the Western Conference Semifinals, the Houston Rockets are a team I believe will give the Lakers serious trouble, assuming they get past Oklahoma City in Wednesday’s Game 7. Although the Lakers have an enormous size advantage over the Rockets and Defensive Player of the Year finalist Davis going up against, well, 6-foot-5 inch PJ Tucker at center, Houston’s small-ball lineup does not match up well for the Lakers.
Russell Westbrook and James Harden make up one of the NBA’s most electrifying backcourts, and their games are complemented perfectly by Houston’s unprecedented spacing and quality 3-point shooters all around. This poses problems for the Lakers, a team that struggles with perimeter defense, especially without key defensive guard Bradley. The Lakers might bully the Rockets in the paint and win the rebound battle by 30, but it won’t matter if Houston hits even a third of their usual barrage of threes against L.A.’s weak perimeter defense.
In the Rockets’ seeding game against the Bucks, Houston was out-rebounded by 26 and outscored in the paint by 40. Both of these things may very well happen every night in a second round matchup between the Lakers and Rockets. However, the Rockets attempted an NBA record 61 threes against the Bucks on a very average 34.4% clip and still won the game behind a much better-than-expected defensive effort from the league’s smallest team.
Additionally, the Rockets are the team benefiting the most coming into the playoffs fully rested. Westbrook and Harden are two of the league’s leaders in usage rate, and they tend to wear down in the playoffs from the heavy load they are asked to carry over the course of a full season. Their small-ball lineup will also need fresh legs to stay active on defense and keep fighting for boards throughout the playoffs.
There’s a reason the Lakers have been one of Vegas’ favorites to win the NBA title for most of the season: three-time champion, four-time league MVP LeBron James, now paired with fellow superstar Davis. If there’s anything I’ve learned watching NBA basketball, it’s that you can never count out a James-led team, and it might be outrageous to suggest that this star-studded duo could lose to the notoriously inconsistent Rockets. 
But the Lakers shot just 34.3% from beyond the arc against the Blazers, and the current NBA demands three-point shooting excellence. James is an average outside shooter, making 34.8% of his threes on the season; Davis is no better at 33%. We know L.A.’s two stars are going to bring their A-games, but their playoff success hinges on the likes of Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, whose primary role is to shoot threes. Unfortunately, they aren’t living up to their roles at the moment. 
On the other hand, no NBA team combines volume and efficiency from long range like the Rockets. If Harden and Westbrook maintain their regular season efficiency against the Lakers and the Rockets’ supporting cast hits their open shots created by their superstar backcourt, they will be very dangerous. Houston is, at the very least, an underrated defensive team. They play with grit and passion on both sides of the ball and have all the tools to knock off the first-seeded Lakers. My prediction? Rockets in seven.

A.J. Eckstein lived his college dream: he secured several internships with Fortune 500 companies and had a coveted post-graduation job lined up with Accenture. When the coronavirus spiraled the economy into a downfall and unemployment rates skyrocketed, Eckstein’s plans luckily stayed the same. 
But in that time, Eckstein noticed many of his peers didn’t have the same fortune. Dedicated to creating opportunities for students navigating the uncharted waters of job recruitment amid the pandemic, Eckstein started the Career Coaching Company in April. Through resume building and behavioral coaching, Eckstein hopes to provide support for students in need. In just the past few weeks, he has already spent around 200 hours coaching students in need.  
After transferring to USC as a sophomore, Eckstein graduated in May with a degree in business administration and had post graduate opportunities that he said he is extremely grateful for.  
“I felt very fortunate when I graduated to still have a full-time job waiting for me,” Eckstein said. “When I graduated I really wanted to pay it forward a few months before I started my full time job.” 
In an effort to give back on his success at USC and in the recruiting process, Eckstein started the Career Coaching Company with fellow Trojan graduates Pablo Alvarez, who serves as director of operations, and Elise Hernandez, the company’s marketing director. 
The Career Coaching Company uses a one-to-one coaching model to help undergraduate students whose jobs were affected by the coronavirus navigate the recruitment process online. Eckstein said his background in consulting along with Alvarez and Hernandez’s knowledge of investment banking and commercial real estate, respectively, help the company work with a broader range of job seekers. 
“Those are the three most sought after industries,” Eckstein said. “We came together and we really wanted to figure out the best way to help as many students who have been impacted by COVID, whether it was internships rescinded [or] jobs rescinded.”
The company began with solely Trojan alumni as career coaches, but Eckstein said he realized that students outside the realm of USC also needed help finding jobs in an economic downturn. 
“Someone who has been through the [recruiting] process already and who can help someone try to get to where they want to be is extremely valuable,” Eckstein said. “To really break into these very competitive industries, to get into companies like the McKinsey’s of the world or the Goldman Sachs’, you really have to find the tips and tricks to break into them, and that’s what  our coaches and myself really provide.” 
Now with 10 coaches on the team, the Career Coaching Company heavily utilizes its Linkedin to market itself. After a student reaches out to the service, Eckstein pairs the student with a coach that can best help them reach their goals of working for Fortune 500 companies or successful consulting companies. 
Kevin Rodriguez, a recent UNC Chapel Hill graduate, joined the team as a coach after Eckstein reached out to him via LinkedIn. 
While Rodriguez has only been working for the Career Coaching Company for the past three weeks, he said he already feels as though he made a difference for at least one of his students, who felt unqualified to enter the job market. 
Rodriguez said he helped edit the student’s resume and saw a change almost immediately.
“Seeing their confidence shoot up after one session … was definitely really meaningful and rewarding,” Rodriquez said. “I’m still working with that individual to get them to a place where they can confidently apply.”
Maria Wharton, a senior majoring in international relations global business, found the Career Coaching Company through LinkedIn and one of her peers who is a coach with the company. After a short call with Eckstein discussing her personal goals, strengths and weaknesses, Wharton scheduled 10 sessions with the company and said she hopes she can create a plan to achieve her personal goals of working on real-world business growth solutions, business technology integration and risk analysis. 
With recruitment season approaching and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic still affecting job hunting efforts, Wharton admitted she was unsure on how to apply for jobs. 
“I’ve had a lot of companies email back saying they’re not recruiting for full-time positions right now,” Wharton said. “I definitely think [finding jobs will be through] either an alumni connection, a USC connection … I definitely think, because the pool is smaller, there’s less opportunity.”
Regardless of the limited positions, Wharton said that Eckstein’s easygoing and confident attitude helped in her job hunt. 
“I feel like I gained knowledge and tools that I myself can tailor,” Wharton said. “I think overall, one, giving me confidence and two, the skills and tools to know what to do [and] where to look so I’m not just asking for help every step of the way. I can kind of gauge myself and ask for overall assistance. I think confidence was my main thing I got from the career coaching services.” 
Eckstein said he and his team have already made important impressions on various students going through recruitment processes within USC and beyond.
“There is really no one there to help the student, hold their hand and walk them through exactly the best practices and strategies and tips and tricks,” Eckstein said. “We want to share our story and practices of breaking into these very competitive industries and getting great positions and jobs by helping as many students [as possible].”
