The USC Muslim Student Union held a discussion on the relationship between black culture and Islam Monday evening in the first of eight Islam Awareness Week events.
The purpose of Islam Awareness Week, according to MSU  Internal Vice President Mahmoud Hamza, is to illustrate the reality of Muslim culture in the face of Islamophobia.
“We want to push back to show different aspects and different sides of Islam from USC students’ perspectives and spread awareness to other students on campus,” Hamza said.
Monday’s event in Zumberge  Hall of Science was meant to illustrate how “Muslims have solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement,” according to MSU Secretary Medeeha Khan.
“It’s very much a core of our theology to support the pursuit of equality for all races,” Khan said. “Given the climate of Islamophobia and the very questionable perspective of Islam that we see in the media, it’s a good way to see what Islam is really about by showing how we partner with such a progressive and essential movement as Black Lives Matter.”
African Muslims who immigrated to the United States were “foundational to the country,” Khan said.
The guest speakers at Monday’s event, Imam Jihad Saafir and Margari Aziza, discussed the life of Malcolm X, police brutality in the United States and the ways that the Muslim community can work to make a difference.
“When we’re talking about Black Lives Matter, we’re talking about really uplifting everybody,” Aziza said. “Are we going to stand with the most oppressed of this country, and what is our Islamic mandate? [Malcolm X] understood justice, and that’s what we need to stand for as Muslims.”
MSU has planned a series of events for the remainder of the week, each working to highlight Muslim culture in a different way.
Tuesday’s events will focus on anti-Muslim behavior in society as well as the treatment of women in Muslim culture, which Khan said has been misunderstood by those outside the Muslim community.
“Islam is about uplifting women,” Khan said. “In fact, it was the religion that brought about the uplifting of women and [gave] them rights and [encouraged] them to pursue their own sphere within the community.”
On Wednesday, MSU plans to distribute roses as “random acts of kindness,” as well as feature the stories of students who have converted to Islam, who Hamza said are “a very diverse group.”
A cultural showcase night is planned for Thursday, featuring the clothing and food of various cultures within the Muslim population.
“It’s a cool way to defy that misconception that Muslims are Arabs, [and] Arabs are Muslims,” said Aamna Asif, MSU event coordinator. “There’s so many different ethnicities, and it’s a cool event to bring that to light.”
Islam Awareness Week will wrap up with the donation of food to people on Skid Row, with preparation occurring Friday night and distribution happening Saturday morning.
“We like to be involved in the community and give back whenever we can,” Asi said.

THE PAGAN SOURCES OF ISLAM
by Silas
GENERAL
            As Muhammad developed Islam he borrowed from the other regional religions present in the Mideast.  These religions include Judaism, Christianity, Sabeanism, Zoroastrianism, and forms of paganism.  Judaism is the largest contributor to Islam, followed by Christianity, then followed by the various pagan religions, and Muhammad’s mind.  These pagan borrowings constitute significant facets of Islam and this article details some of these pagan contributions.
1) PAGANISM IN ISLAM
            Islamic theology has some of its roots in various pagan beliefs.  Primary to Islam is it’s most holiest shrine:  the Kaba.
THE KABA
            The Kaba is now the most revered sanctuary of Islam.  It is located in Mecca.  Muslims throughout the world direct their prayers toward the Kaba.
PHYSICAL SHAPE
            The Kaba’s shape is somewhat cubical.  Of note in the Kaba’s structure is a black rock built into the wall in its eastern corner.  The black rock’s diameter is about 12 inches.  It is reddish black in color, and has red and yellow particles.  The black rock is kissed during the perambulation, (the circulation of the Muslims around the Kaba).  The Kaba is about 50 feet high, and the walls are about 40 feet long.  The facade contains the door, which starts at 7 feet off the ground, and faces N.E.. To enter the Kaba, a ladder must be used.  Also built in the eastern corner, is another stone called “lucky”.  This stone is only touched, not kissed.
KNOWN PAGAN HISTORY
            Apart from Muslim myths, little is really known about the history of the Kaba.  About 60 years before Christ, the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus commented that there was in Arabia a temple greatly revered by the Arabs.  It is probable that he had the Kaba in mind.  It was later mentioned to have existed in the 2nd century; Ptolemy, the geographer mentions it in his work, calling it the ‘macoraba’.  The Kaba was a sanctuary dedicated to one or more pagan deities.  The accounts of the campaigns of Abraha note that it was a place of pagan worship in the 6th century.  Information on the distribution of the offices among the sons of Kusayy show that the worship of the sanctuary had developed into a regulated cult several generations before Muhammad.
            One historian (Hurgronjes) said that sacred worship may have developed around the area because the Zamzam spring was found in this waterless place.
            Pre-Islamic history tells us that many Arabian tribes were stone worshippers.  This is also mentioned in Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol 5, #661.  The Old Testament even talks about Mideast pagan groups that worshipped stones.  Muhammad incorporated the Kaba’s paganistic roots into Islam to give the Muslims a sense of identity, legitimacy, and uniqueness. He also wanted to ease the Arab’s strain of moving from paganism to Islam, by continuing the practices of their fathers.
PAGAN GODS AND RITUALS
            There were 360 idols around the Kaba.  The pilgrimages to the Kaba were all pagan pilgrimages, the ritual processions around the Kaba were part of pagan beliefs and custom, the white robes worn by the pilgrims were from pagan faiths, the veneration of the Kaba and black stone are derived from pagan rituals and beliefs.  Pagans called out the names of their pagan gods as they circled the Kaba, today, Muslims call out Allah’s name.  Pagans ran between the nearby hills, Muhammad authorized Muslims to do that in the Quran, and probably ran between the hills himself.
            The chief pagan god worshipped there was Hubal, who could be called the god of Mecca and of the Kaba.  Hubal is not mentioned in the Quran. The goddesses al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat were also worshipped there and are mentioned in the Quran.
            It is thought that the Kaba was originally set up for astral worship.  Golden suns and moons are repeatedly mentioned as the votive gifts.  Some pagans regarded the Kaba as a temple devoted to the sun, moon, and 5 planets.
THE BLACK STONE
            The black stone played a prominent role in pagan worship.  The pagans offered animal sacrifices there.  But the idol of the black stone replaced the alter; on the black stone they smeared the blood of the sacrificed animals.
QURANIC MYTHS
            Muhammad made up historical references for the Kaba.  Muhammad claimed that Abraham and Ishmael laid the foundations of the Kaba (Q. 2:127). Muhammad claimed that God ordained the Kaba as a sacred house (Q. 5:97). Muhammad also claimed that it was the first temple ever built for mankind (Q. 3:97).
            Only Muhammad claimed that it was a place built by Abraham.  In looking in the O.T., we find no mention of Abraham traveling to Mecca to build a house of worship.
            Further, the late Taha Hussein, one of the most famous Egyptian professors of Arabic literature said that the Islamic myth of Abraham building the Kaba came into vogue just before the rise of Islam.  He comments:
            “The case of this episode is very obvious because it is of recent date, and came into vogue just before the rise of Islam.  Islam exploited it for religious reasons”.  Quoted in ‘Mizar al-Islam’ by Anwar al-Jundi.
THEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
            Every man living in Mecca before and during Muhammad’s life had some relationship with the Kaba.  If the Kaba was the house of God, why did Muhammad order his followers to face Jerusalem?  Muhammad’s ‘revelation’ in the Quran says that when Allah had Muhammad change prayer directions, it was a test of the Muslims.  This sounds like a lame excuse on Muhammad’s part.  What’s the test?  Face another direction?  That does not appear to be such an incredible challenge!
            Probably the real answer is that through his early contacts with Christians and Jews, Muhammad knew that their faiths, centered in Jerusalem, where monotheistic.  Muhammad abhorred polytheistic worship, consequently he aligned himself with faiths that he believed were from the true God.  He selected Jerusalem as the direction of prayer.  He hoped that the Jews would receive him as a prophet.
            About a year and a half after the migration to Medina, after the Jews had thoroughly rejected him, he turned the direction of prayer to Mecca – the center of pagan worship in the Arabian peninsula (Q. 2:144).  Just as he had compromised with the pagan idol worshippers in Mecca, by sanctioning and worshipping the pagan goddesses Lat, Uzza, and Manat, so now he hoped to gain favor with the pagan Arab tribes that worshipped at the Kaba in Mecca.  He authenticated the pagan focus of attention.
            After Muhammad took Mecca, he cleansed the Kaba.  Inside the Kaba were many representations of the prophets.  When his men began to cleanse the Kaba, and wash out the representations, Muhammad placed his hands on the pictures of Jesus and Mary, and said “Wash out all except what is below my hands”.  Again, Muhammad went against his own principles, and sanctioned his definition of idolatry.
            Muhammad then sanctioned the pagan rituals concerning the Kaba, i.e. kissing the black stone, touching the Kaba, circling the structure, running between the two hills, etc.  Later, Umar said to the black stone “I know that you are a stone, that neither helps nor hurts, and if the messenger of god had not kissed you, I would not kiss you”. (Sahih al-Bukhari, volume 2, #667).   But then he kissed the stone.  Like Umar, many other Muslims follow the prophet in their practice of veneration of a pagan idol.
            Before Muhammad, there was a group of people in Arabia who also abhorred idolatry.  They were known as the Hanifites.  Even the Hanifites saw that kissing the black stone was pagan idolatry.  During one of the pre-Islamic Eids, the Qurayshi were worshipping their idols, slaying sacrifices, praying, and making circuits around the Kaba.  Just as they did each year for this festival.  Some Hanifites saw them, and stood apart from them, and said:
            “By the Lord!, our people have nothing left of the faith of Abraham.  What is this stone that we should encircle it?  It can neither hear nor speak, neither hurt nor help.  O our people, look out for your souls, for by the Lord are you altogether wanting.”
     One of the Hanifites was Obeidallah… later he embraced Islam.  He immigrated to Abyssinia with other Muslims.  Later he became a Christian.  After his conversion, he said to his Muslim friends ‘We (Christians) see, but you are only blinking’ – that is, cannot see plainly.
            So, why then does Muhammad kiss the black stone?  Why did he incorporate paganism into his faith.  There is even the Quranic story of Abraham – how he chided those who worshipped idols sura 6, 21, etc., and said it was sinful in God’s sight.  Yet here we have Muhammad walking around the Kaba, just like the pagans, kissing the stone, just like the pagans.  Even Umar knew it was empty and false, yet he followed Muhammad in kissing the stone.
            It cannot be denied that an entire pagan theology and ritual, was adopted by Islam, after Muhammad had one of his convenient ‘revelations’ and made it ‘religiously’ correct.
            Another Muslim myth, concerning the Kaba, is that ‘anyone who prays under the Kaba’s water-pipe becomes as pure as on the day when his mother bore him’.  Muslims have a hard time accepting Christ’s atonement, but will allow for total forgiveness of sins by uttering a prayer under a spout!
POST MUHAMMAD HISTORY
            In one of the early Muslim civil wars (a.d. 683), al-Zubayr in Mecca was besieged by al-Husayn.  Husayn’s men used catapults and damaged the Kaba.  It looked like ‘the torn bosoms of mourning women’.  Zubayr and his men pitched their tents next to the Kaba, and a conflagration caught the Kaba on fire.  The Kaba was severely damaged, and the black stone was split into three pieces.
            A short time later, al-Hadjdjadj conquered Mecca and killed Zubayr.  He modified the Kaba’s structure.
            In 929, the Karmatians invaded Mecca and carried off the black stone!  20 years later it was returned.
            Other natural events (bad weather) have also caused the Kaba to need repair.
            Muslims erroneously claim that God has protected the Quran from corruption, yet their god was not able to protect his sacred house!
POST MUHAMMAD ISLAMIC MYTHOLOGY
            Later Muslim theologians invented a number of myths about Mecca and the Kaba.
            One Islamic tradition is – according to Ibn Abbas:  Muhammad said, ‘The black stone came from Paradise and at the time of its descent it was whiter than milk, but that the sins of the children of Adam have caused it to be black, by their touching it.  That on the Day of Resurrection, when it will have two eyes, by which it will see and know all those who touched it and kissed it, and when it will have a tongue to speak, it will give evidence in favor of those who touched and kissed it’!
            Muslim writers also said that the Kaba was first constructed in heaven, 2000 years before the creation of the world, where a model of it still remains.  Adam erected the first Kaba on earth exactly below the spot its perfect model occupies in heaven!  10,000 angels were appointed to guard Adam’s Kaba, but obviously they didn’t do a good job!  God then instructed Abraham to rebuild it.
            There are a number of other myths about the Kaba.  Among them are that Mecca is the navel of the world, that the Kaba was established at the creation of the world, destroyed during the flood, re-built by Abraham, that Gabriel provided the black stone.  There are also legends about the Zamzam water from the nearby well.
            Some Muslims say that there are references to the Kaba in the O.T.  Here are a few mistaken claims:
1)  Muslims hope that Gen 35:4, 14, 15 refer to the Kaba.  Since “Beth-El” = House of God, and that the Jewish temple wasn’t built until much later.  But as the Bible shows, Bethel is a town, in Palestine – Genesis chapter 12.  Also, Jacob built an altar, not a temple to God.  Abraham also built an altar to the Lord in Gen 12:7.
2)  Muslims claim that David mentions the Kaba in Psalm 84:6.  If ‘Baca’ was a location, it was not known where it existed in the Bible.  But a more correct interpretation, taken in context of the whole Psalm, is that since ‘baca’ means weeping, it means ‘valley of tears’.  David could be saying that he longs for the presence of God, and that even through difficult times (baca) God will be with him, and will turn his tears to joy.
3)  Muslims also think that Isaiah 60:7 “All the flocks of Kedar” refers to Arabian people worshipping at the Kaba.  Reading thru Isa 60:7, it shows that Kedar’s flocks are going to be sacrificed on the alter.  Are Muslims saying that Arabs were going to be human sacrifices?
4)  Some Muslims think that since the New Jerusalem in the book of Revelation is cubic, it also resembles the Kaba and thus is a prophecy of the Kaba!  But the Kaba is not a perfect cube, not even close.  The structure is 50 ft high, with a sloping roof, the shorter walls are 35 feet long, and the facade is 40 ft. long.
SUMMARY FOR THE ISLAMIC RITES CENTERED ON THE KABA
            Every Muslim that makes the Hajj, every Muslim that runs between the hills, every Muslim that bestows a kiss on the black stone, is performing pagan rituals, founded on pagan superstitions, sanctioned by Muhammad himself.
            Muslims have accused Christianity of incorporating paganism, and to an extent, some exterior cultural aspects have been. But paganism is an integral root of Islam; paganism is part of it’s theology, history, ceremony, and veneration.
            My references for this section are from the original Hughes Dictionary of Islam (not the recent one that has been sanitized by a Muslim publisher), the Shorter Ency. of Islam, and the Ency. of Islam, pub. by E. J. Brill, and ‘The Sources of Islam’ by Tisdall.
MORE ISLAMIC PAGANISM
THE NIGHT JOURNEY
            The Night Journey describes Muhammad’s ascent into heaven.  It is briefly mentioned in sura 17:1, and described in Sahih al-Bukhari, in several of his volumes, notably in vol 1, #345.
            Muhammad’s story parallels a Zoroastrian story.  It is found in an old Pahlavi book known as “The Book of Arta Viraf”.  The Zoroastrian story describes the journey of a saintly priest (Arta Viraf), who went into a trance and his spirit went up to the heavens under the guidance of an angel named Sarosh.  He passed from one utopia (7 heavens?) to another until he reached the presence of Ormazd, the great deity of the whole universe.  When Arta saw everything in heaven and that the inhabitants were very happy, Ormazd commanded him to return to earth as his ‘messenger’ and to tell the people all that he saw and heard.
            Also, the Zoroastrians taught, long before Islam, there was a marvelous tree in Paradise called ‘humaya’, which corresponds very closely to the ‘sidrah’, the lote tree of Islam.
            Finally, there is another Zoroastrian work the ‘Zerdashtnama’, which has a story of how Zoroaster himself ascended into the heavens and obtained permission to visit hell, where he found Ahriman, the Devil.
            All of these stories are paralleled in the Quran.  No doubt Muhammad heard these stories and decided to put himself on a level with Zoroaster and others.  So, now we have Muhammad copying the Zoroastrian stories and claiming to have these experiences.
     Again, while Muslims claim that paganism influenced Christianity, we see that paganism is part of the core of Islamic faith and theology.
AZAZIL – THE DEVIL
            In the Muslim Hadith, the Devil has a certain name – Azazil.
The name does not occur in the Quran.  The name may come from Leviticus 16:8, 10, 26 – the scapegoat in Hebrew is Azazil.  From another source it means ‘the demon of the desert’.
            There are Apocrypha Jewish books – Enoch and Apocalypse of Abraham, that mention Azazil.  Islamic traditions – Hadiths develop their story.  Muslims associate Azazil with the fallen angels Harut and Marut.  Ibn Abbas tradition has the strongest Islamic reference developing it as Satan’s name, before the fall of Adam.
Here is Tisdall’s view on it (taken from “The Sources of Islam”):
            Muslims take the name Azazil from the Jews, but put the Zoroastrian story behind the name.  Muslims believe that God created Azazil, who worshipped God for a 1000 years while he was in the 7th hell. Then he ascended a stage at a time, all the while worshipping God. Finally, he reached the earth.  Elsewhere, Muslim tradition says he stayed 3000 years by the gate of paradise, with hostile intentions against Adam and Eve.  He was very jealous of them.
            Compare the above with the Zoroastrian account:
            Ahriman (Azazil) remained in the abyss, there to commit hurt and injury, and mischief and darkness.  Ormazd (God) knew of his existence and plans.  It went on like this for 3000 years.  The evil spirit was ignorant of Ormazd’s existence, but eventually rising out of the pit, saw Ormazd’s light.  Then Ahriman was filled with hostility and envy, he set out to destroy.
THE SABEANS
            Who were the Sabeans?  Why did Muhammad regard them as believers in the true God?  The Sabeans are mentioned at least 3 times in the Quran:
1)  2:62 – “Believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabeans; whoever believes in God and the last day and does what is right, shall be rewarded by their Lord; they have nothing to fear or regret.”
2)  5:69 – “Believers, Jews, Sabeans and Christians; whoever believes in God and the last day and does what is right, shall have nothing to fear or to regret.”
3)  22:17 – “As for the true believers, the Jews, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Magians, and the pagans, God will judge them on the day of Resurrection.  God bears witness to all things.”
            Although what is known about the Sabeans is not comprehensive, enough has been written about them to determine a basic understanding of their practices and beliefs.  Most of the writings are from Islamic sources. Some of the writers are Ibn Hazm in ‘Fisal wa-Milal’, Ibn al-Nadim in the ‘Fihrist’, Shahrastani in ‘The Treaty on Sects’, and Masudi in ‘Muruj al-Dhahab.
            Ibn Hazm, writing in ‘Fisal wa-Milal’, identifies the people then known as ‘Harranians’ as the ‘Sabeans’ mentioned in the Quran.  Hazm writes that they honored the seven planets and the twelve constellations, they have 5 times of prayer, (the same times as the Muslims pray), they fast in Ramadan, they venerate and turn to the Kaba in prayer.  Hazm also says they also worshipped the stars and idols.  Hazm further claims that Allah sent Abraham to turn them away from pagan worship, but Abraham didn’t succeed.
            Comparing all the early writings on the Sabeans, we find that they inhabited Syria, and spread from there, they were definitely pagans, having a mixture of Babylonian and Helenic religion.  The ‘prophets’ they professed to follow were Hermes and Agathodaemon, who they identified in Shahrastani’s time with Seth and Idris (O.T. Enoch). Gods who were worshipped were the gods of the 7 week-days, the god of the Jinn, the lord of the Hour, the god who makes arrows fly, the god Tammuz (a variation of the one previously mentioned), Hamam the prince, the father of the gods, the god ‘North’, the lord ‘Fortune’, etc.  They also kept the Eid of their own.  Further, the Sabeans made star worship a chief characteristic of their system.
            So, did Islam get the 5 times a day prayer? –From the star worshipping Sabeans.  What about fasting during Ramadan? – from the Sabeans. The Eid? – from the Sabeans.
            It seems very odd to me that Muhammad, the man who’s central doctrine was the oneness of God, would include pagan worshippers as those who were believers in the true God.  If Muhammad were truly a prophet, how could he have made such a big mistake? How did astral worshippers get included into the Quran as those that worship the true God?  How could Muhammad’s ‘revelation’ be in such error?
            It is noteworthy that just as Muhammad incorporated the pagan veneration of the Kaba and black stone into Islam, so he incorporated the Sabean times of prayer, Eid, and fasting into Islam.
            Once again, Muhammad didn’t fully know the subject he was synthesizing into Islam.  I have read nothing about their doctrine that would have led Muhammad to include them as followers of the one true God he preached about.  Perhaps he learned a small portion about their religion, and believed it to be right.  Little did he know that under that veneer of words, lay many theological differences.
HOURIS
            The Quran mentions ‘houris’ several times 44:50, 52:20, 55:60, 56:20, 78:33.  Who or what are they?  They are ‘bashful virgins’, ‘fair as coral and ruby’, ‘dark eyed youths’, ‘high bosomed maidens (big breasted)’. In sum, they are creatures put in Paradise, primarily for men’s sexual pleasures.  Each man will have at least two of them.
            This concept is derived from the Zoroastrian sources.  In Zoroastrian writings they are referred to as ‘Faries’ – spirits in bright array and beautiful to captivate the heart of man.  The name ‘Houris’ comes from a Pehlavi source, as does the Islamic ‘Jinn’ for Genie.
CONCLUSION
            It’s not difficult to see how Muhammad heard various sacred religious stories, and incorporated them into Islam.  Perhaps he thought that parts of those religions contained truth, so he adopted what he thought to be correct.  But nevertheless, part of the foundation of Islam is paganism.
People are =/= to their religion
 I am most definitely an infidel in that I have no belief in any god or gods. A person’s individual godview is the most basic right
 possible that a human being can have. I personally reject Islam, Judaism, and Christianity (among others)…but do not reject Muslims, Jews, and Christians. A person’s religion and religious culture are most predictably based on their family of origin, where they were born (geography), and when they were born (i.e. no Xians pre-Christ).
 I stand with all people on the planet willing to work together as a species to live peacefully with each other and our environment. That does not change regardless of the actions of some who think their ‘godview’ justifies any number of horrible acts.
 I reject those who use such acts to demonize people who are damned for nothing more than ‘guilt by association.’
 ~ LanceThruster
I do too, Lance.  The problem is people’s religions often shape them.  The Amish, for instance, tend to be very Amish-like.  Jews tend to be highly educated and Buddhists tend to be inward-looking.
And, Muslims?  Tell us, Lance, do you notice any “general” characteristics common to Muslims?
Stop being terrorists = no more Islamaphobia. 
How many Blacks did Muslim jihadists kill in their conquest of Sudan in-and-around the turn of the century?  How many Blacks have Muslim killed in Nigeria in their ongoing jihad against the Black Christians of Nigeria?  
I do not understand what Blacks are thinking in aligning themselves with an ideology that would have their necks if given the chance.
From NW China to shopping malls in Kenya, from discos in Bali to beach resorts in Morocco, from hotels in Mumbai to bus depots in London, from grade schools in Russia to Easter Masses in Pakistan and on and on and on the Islamic terror goes.
But let’s pretend Islam should be trusted and let’s also pretend in the tooth fairy too.
Why would anyone in their right mind fear Islam other than the fact that Islam is terrorizing every country and people it can possibly reach?
Wait, wasn’t Malcolm X murdered by his fellow koranimals?
No, thanks. I am already well aware of the Satanic death cult of pislam.

Since holding a strike in early February, the National Union of Healthcare Workers has been successful in negotiations with USC’s Keck School of Medicine in earning an improved contract with the university healthcare system for 800 workers.
“Eight hundred USC Keck workers forced USC to adhere to its own rhetoric by making them full members of the Trojan family, both by compensating them fairly and by granting them a voice in the hospital’s staffing and patient-care policies,” said Sophia Mendoza, NUHW’s secretary-treasurer.
That contract — which was finalized in late March and includes an annual wage that is calculated by experience and years of service as well as tuition assistance — however, has currently not been extended to 100 workers who work in the hospital cafeteria but are employees of subcontractor Sodexo, a national company that provides “quality of life” services to many institutions.
According to a video on the NUHW Facebook page, USC and Sodexo have been paying some Keck Hospital employees “pennies above minimum wage”   without taking into account factors such as length of service. As a result, NUHW claims that some Keck employees have had to ask for government assistance such as food stamps to make ends meet.
The video also compares USC to public institutions such as UC campuses and the Los Angeles Unified School District and how those institutions have made commitments to pay their service workers a minimum wage of $15 an hour.
Mendoza noted that USC has the resources to pay a livable wage to its workers at Keck.
“It is fully within USC’s power and means to see that all of its workers, even those employed by subcontractors, are paid a livable wage,” Mendoza said.
In late January, the NUHW had informed the University that a one-day strike would be held at Keck Hospital demanding of a better contract for the union’s employees on Feb. 10. The NUHW workers on the picket line included nurses and food services and cafeteria staff, as well as other picketers from the California Nurses Association in support of NUHW.
A statement from Keck Hospital called the strike “largely a non-event” and claimed that only a fraction of Keck’s NUHW-affiliated employees actually participated. To prevent the strike from affecting patient care, Keck hired contract employees and worked with the LAPD to provide a “safe environment” throughout the strike.
USC acquiesced before the beginning of April on the contracts for healthcare workers.
However, the union will continue to negotiate the contract for the 100 food service workers it represents at Keck. Currently, NUHW has alleged that USC has had Sodexo keep costs down at the expense of worker’s salaries.
Mendoza points out that USC can remedy the situation in a number of ways, such as by paying Sodexo more money for salaries or by doing away with the subcontractor all together.
“The real solution is for USC to stop exploiting these workers via Sodexo by bring them back in-house and treating them as full members of the Trojan family, with full Trojan pay and benefits,” Mendoza said.
USC has yet to provide a statement on the NUHW agreement or on continuing discussions at the time of publication.
The University did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Approximately 10 USC students gathered in front of Tommy Trojan Monday to protest the recent raise in tuition for next semester. Demonstrators held signs and repeatedly chanted the phrase, “Nikias step off it, put students over profit.”
This protest is the latest in a series of events held in response to USC recently raising its tuition from $49,464 to $51,422, which raises the overall estimated cost of attendance to $69,711 for the 2016-2017 school year. Another rally protesting tuition hikes was held at Tommy Trojan on March 7 and a banner saying “Stop USC Tuition Hikes” was dropped in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday.
Event organizer Nadja Barlera, a junior majoring in English, said that these protests are continuing because students feel that the administration hasn’t been listening to their voices. Barlera specifically pointed to the lack of university response to an Undergraduate Student Government resolution as well as a student-organized petition with more than 850 signatures that both called for a tuition freeze as one of the main reason for the recent protests.
“The administration hasn’t really responded to any of our demands from the college freeze petition or resolution last semester,” Barlera said. “So we want to show them that we’re not going away and that we care about this issue.”
The University, however, has stressed that it strives to keep yearly price increases low, and that rising costs and increased demand for student services make tuition hikes unavoidable. In a letter to USG and GSG on March 10, Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry wrote that the University publishes its financial data online well before tuition increases take effect, but that it also recognizes the need for increased transparency and student involvement.
“In direct response to the resolutions presented by the USG and GSG, I will commit the Division of Student Affairs to work with them on a memorandum of understanding to reinstate the Student Fee Advisory Committee,” Carry wrote in the letter. “This MOU will articulate the purpose and roles for the committee and its members, including the review of proposed fee increases and the communication of any year-over-year increases in tuition and fees.”
According to Barlera, the information for the rally was mainly spread Sunday night through a Facebook group called “Stop USC Tuition Hikes.” For this particular rally, Barlera said that the goal was mainly to notify students about the recent raises in tuition.
“This was mostly to try and raise awareness,” Barlera said. “A lot of people who saw us didn’t even know that tuition had gone up because USC hasn’t really told anyone.”
At the rally, students such as Preston Fregia, a freshman majoring in political science, spoke about the potential long-lasting implications of continued tuition hikes and how this topic could be something that students can band together over.
“This will affect us, your grandchildren, and everyone in this area,” Fregia said. “This is an issue that we can all have the same opinion on.”
While students have already taken action by delivering letters into the administration, Barlera said that students are going to continue protesting until they elicit a formal response from the administration.
“If the University continues to ignore us, we’re definitely going to do more,” Barlera said.

Last Thursday, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority unveiled its potential plan to expand mass transit in Los Angeles. The $120 billion expansion plan would be funded by a potential sales tax increase set to be voted on in a November ballot measure.
If the proposed plan were to be approved, it would increase efficiency in public transportation in Los Angeles, as well as reduce traffic and improve highways and bike paths.
According to The Los Angeles Times, the transit blueprint would fund more than three dozen mass transit and highway improvements in the span of 40 to 45 years if voters support the tax plan. Some of these improvements include new rail routes through Claremont, Van Nuys, Westwood and Artesia.
“This is a bold, ambitious and necessary proposal that would finally deliver the comprehensive, interconnected transit network L.A. County needs. After more than two years of hard work, the draft plan addresses local concerns and would generate county-wide congestion relief, air quality improvements and economic benefits,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in an official statement. “We are losing billions of dollars while Angelenos continue to be mired in traffic, and we must take action now.”
The initial plan would be funded through Measure R2, a half-cent sales tax increase that would funds transportation projects.
Despite its plans to reduce traffic and increase efficiency in Los Angeles, critics raised concerns about the plan.
“The system is certainly stacked against [small] cities,” Palmdale Mayor James Ledford told LA Weekly. “Road maintenance is a real issue for cities, and I don’t see any help for that.”
Sooji Nam, a sophomore double majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and international relations, said that even though she appreciates efforts to improve the public transportation system, she thinks that the money allocated for it would be better spent elsewhere.
“Well, I personally don’t use the Metro or public transportation. I think it’s interesting that they want to refurbish it,” Nam said. “I think it’s a good thing to improve infrastructure, but I feel like the bulk of money should not go to that. I feel like money should be steered towards social change.”
Measure J, a half-cent transportation sales tax similar to Measure R2, failed to receive a two-thirds majority and was rejected in 2012.
“I think it should pass, but it’s probably not going to pass because there’s too many people in L.A. County without transit [and] this tax wouldn’t affect them in a positive way,” said Josh Chung, a senior majoring in business administration. “People in Diamond Bar will be paying the same sales tax, and they won’t be receiving the same benefits because there is not transit out there.”
Chung said that Metro should also address other issues, such as safety on the Blue Line.
Metro’s Draft Expenditure Plan can be viewed at theplan.metro.net. Metro will hold public meetings through the month of April, where residents can speak to Metro personnel, voice concerns and give feedback.
Stop calling it a half cent tax!  It is a half of 1 percent sales tax hike and it extends an already approved tax hike making it a FULL 1% tax hike till the year 2057.  That means if you buy a $40,000 car it will cost you an extra $400.  Our cities approve high density housing to boost tax revenue and we the people have to deal with greater and greater congestion.  Now these cities want to keep that money and tax us more for the traffic mess they are creating.  Enough with building multi level condos and apartments.  It waters down existing homes and lowers the standard of living..FIGHT ON!
So you get the opinion of people who don’t use the system?  Their opinions are useless in this debate.  Social change?  What does that even mean? No I would prefer that my money be spent on something that’s real and physical.  Social change doesn’t cost anything but the time and will of the public.  Sorry but EVERYBODY in LA county will benefit from the improvements by giving the public at large another option rather than sitting on a freeway. The option not to do this is simply not a choice this city isn’t getting any smaller and to stand around and say no let’s wait until the problem gets worse and even more expensive is just stupid.  How on earth did these students ever get accepted to USC?  I would have gotten better answers pro or con from a class of kindergarteners.  No one likes having to pay more in taxes but this is one issue we simply can’t ignore the time is now get with it!

For the last eight years, Mark Marino, an associate professor of writing, has successfully incorporated service in his course curriculum. This semester, his WRIT 340 course, “Advanced Writing for Social Sciences,” will be building an urban garden for a homeless shelter called Pathways to Home.
“I started using service projects in 2008, when one of my summer classes created a website called SOS Classroom to help counteract LAUSD’s decision to cancel summer school,” Marino said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I was inspired by the model of [fellow WRIT 340 professors] John Murray and Stephanie Bower, who teach a service learning writing course that involves creating video profiles of and with area nonprofits.”
Juhee Shah, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development, is one of the students in Marino’s class this semester and discussed how the class collectively came to the conclusion to tackle homelessness.
“In addition to our papers, we had to write wall posts on topics we are passionate about,” Shah said. “Eventually, our class compiled all the different causes, and the one we were unanimously interested in was the homeless population.”
According to Shah, the class was inspired by Ted Talk speaker Ron Finley to create the garden.
“Ron Finley is a ‘guerilla gardener’ who plants vegetable gardens in South Central L.A.,” Shah said. “He has grown a nourishing food culture by planting the seeds and tools for healthy eating, and we wanted to follow his lead.”
The class has already started making preparations for the service project, and the tentative date to visit the shelter and begin planting is April 19.
Sareen Palassian, a senior double majoring in international relations and French and a copy editor for the Daily Trojan, is in charge of researching plants and figuring out the best crops to grow in the garden.
“Basically, our professor lets us pick our own role so we can each take ownership of the project,” Palassian said. “My job is to research plants and put together an ultimate caretaking guidebook for those at the shelter.”
Palassian explained that she tried to select plants that don’t take up too much water.
“Most vegetables require a lot of water in general, but we wanted to be as compatible as possible for an urban environment like L.A. that doesn’t necessarily have many resources,” Palassian said. “We ended up choosing late spring and early summer crops such as green beans, bell peppers and squash.”
Palassian and her class have already started the urban farming process by planting the seeds in small egg cartons so they can sprout.
“When it’s time to go to Pathways to Home, we’ll take the seedlings out and move them into a large planter,” Palassian said. “We want this to be a sustainable project so that after we leave, others can come in and continue the process.”
Both Shah and Palassian have appreciated the element of service in their WRIT 340 class this semester. Shah appreciated how the project has brought the class closer together.
“As a class, it has brought us closer together,” Shah said. “We all know each other quite well now, and that doesn’t happen a lot in [General Education] courses.”
On the other hand, Palassian is happy that the class is doing something to contribute to the surrounding community.
“This is the first time I’ve done something off campus with a class, which is pretty necessary when you go to a school like USC,” Palassian said. “We have a reputation for being closed off and isolated within L.A., so I think it’s great that we are getting more in touch with the outside community.”

Since its inaugural season in 1996, the women’s water polo team has been a household name in the NCAA, winning four national titles — in 1999, 2004, 2010 and 2013 — with repeated NCAA championship game appearances. The program has only known one coach who built a nationally recognized competitor in just 21 short years: Jovan Vavic.
The Women of Troy have had some impressive season records. Their last undefeated season was in 2004 when the Trojans were 29-0 and went on to win the national championship. This season could bring a similar outcome with the Trojans already well into their season, maintaining a perfect record of 17-0 and a 3-0 mark in MPSF action.
“[The 2016 team] is one of the most talented teams I’ve coached,” Vavic said. “They are all committed to training and have a lot of determination and fire in them.”
The depth in USC’s roster has been key to their success. Major stat leaders include junior attacker Stephania Haralabidis who leads the conference in assists and is second in conference in goals scored, averaging 2.7 goals per game. Four Trojans are also featured on the offensive stat rankings with junior attacker Ioanna Haralibidis, junior utility Avery Peterson, junior center Brigitta Games and sophomore utility Brianna Daboub.
On the defensive side, the team ranks first in the MPSF, allowing just 4.73  goals against per game. Freshman goalie Amanda Longan and sophomore goalie Victoria Chamorro are both in the top 10 among MPSF goaltenders as Longan owns the No. 6 spot in seven games of work with 59 saves and Chamorro, coming in at the No. 9 spot, had 47 saves in 6.5 games of work.
Chamorro cites film as a major contributor to the goaltenders’ success.
“We’ve been watching a lot of video to not only correct our own mistakes for future games, but also to study the competition and find their weaknesses to beat them,” Chamorro said.
Vavic notes that the team is calm and collected in their defensive end.
“We have the No. 1 defense in the conference,” Vavic said. “A major threat to our team success would be if the players are not disciplined on defense and giving up opportunities to score for the other team.”
The team also has a variety of international players who have represented their respective countries in the FINA Junior World Championship. Junior attackers Stephania and Ioanna Haralabidis represented Greece in the championship while sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey played for the Canadian Junior National Team in the same tournament. Other Trojans in the tournament were freshmen Brooke Presten and Amanda Longan, who represented Team USA and helped bring home the gold.
With 11 of their 16 active players on the roster having played at the national and international level, the Trojans possess significant experience and athleticism.
But their recognizable talent is not the only thing that sets the Trojans apart from the competition.
“We have a great team chemistry,” Chamorro said. “We constantly give feedback to each other on what we are doing well and need to work on. Our coach also helps unify us. He teaches us so much every day at practice.”
With just four more regular season games before the playoffs, the Trojans are looking to maintain their No. 1 seed and finish with a championship.
“We don’t plan week by week,” Vavic said. “Instead, we focus on perfecting everything throughout the season. It’s been our goal since the beginning and will continue to be as the season goes on.”
Still, the undefeated record does not mean the Women of Troy plan on coasting through their remaining games.
“We definitely cannot get comfortable with our record in mind,” Chamorro said. “We need to constantly pick up the intensity and keep improving. Preparation is the key to maintaining our success in the future since we have a big target on us.”

Baseball comes home from Stanford after losing two of three games to the Cardinals over the weekend. The Trojans now find themselves two games under .500 at 12-14 for the season and they are at an even 3-3 in Pac-12 play. They will look to start building some momentum on Tuesday in their first of four home games this week, as USC hosts Pepperdine at Dedeaux Field on Tuesday night.
The team’s last loss to Stanford was a bitter pill to swallow — at one point the Trojans even looked primed to go for a three-game sweep. After grabbing a 1-0 win on Friday night, USC led the Cardinals 8-3 through five innings the next day at Klein Field at Sunken Diamond — the halfway point of the series. At its conclusion, however, the Trojans had dropped the series, blowing the lead on Saturday in an 11-8 loss and dropping the rubber game on Sunday, 8-1.
“We just didn’t play very good baseball for the last game and a half,” head coach Dan Hubbs said.
Although it is far from time to panic, the margin for error is beginning to thin, as Pac-12 play has ramped up in earnest. USC will face a conference opponent week-in and week-out for the remainder of the regular season and the team finds itself looking for a spark going into its midweek matchup against Pepperdine.
Hubbs  emphasized that the Trojans have to stay within themselves and execute fundamentals to generate some energy.
“We need to throw strikes, play defense and get timely hits,” Hubbs said. “We just need to play consistently and if we do that, I think we’ll be in good shape.”
The head coach urged his players to continue to play confidently and with self-belief, saying the results will follow.
“I honestly believe we’re going to go on our run,” Hubbs said. “There’s too much talent here not to. The way we won’t … is if we start feeling sorry for ourselves.”
The Trojans will look to start their run against a Pepperdine team that sits at 13-13 for the season. The Waves are battle-tested and are coming off of their first in-conference series win of the season against USF. However, Pepperdine has not traveled well so far this spring. Albeit in small sample size, the Waves currently sport a 1-6 record on the road.
USC will look to add to Pepperdine’s traveling woes at Dedeaux Field. Tuesday will be an opportunity for the Trojans to rebound from their weekend losses and kick their season into high gear.
“There’s plenty of time to turn it around and play the kind of baseball we think we’re capable of playing, and if we do that, then it’ll all work out for us,” Hubbs said. “I still believe that these kids are capable of going on a big run and putting ourselves in a position to go to the postseason.”
First pitch between USC and Pepperdine will be at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

Out too “soon” · Buddy Hield’s heroics were not enough to propel the Sooners to the championship game, as Oklahoma fell to Villanova. – Photo courtesy of Siandhara Bonnet | OU Daily
Oklahoma was dismantled by eventual champion Villanova in the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament.
It was a shocking performance from the Sooners, who now find themselves in the college basketball history books for undesirable reasons. Lon Kruger’s seemingly incredible team lost by 44 points in the most iconic round of the sport’s most iconic competition. It was, even for the most neutral fan, quite hard to watch.
Yet OU was the real champion of the two biggest college sports for the 2015-16 season. The Sooners advanced to the national semifinal in both football and in men’s basketball.
Of course, no one is going to argue against winning titles. But widely appreciated yet less verbalized by college sports fans is the notion that their team is nationally relevant. It is the feeling that your team’s performance on any given day will impact a program a couple thousand miles away.
Florida and Ohio State owned the 2006-07 campaign in both football and men’s hoops, as the Gators downed the Buckeyes in the title game in both sports that season. Unsurprisingly, those four teams had special, program-defining players: Percy Harvin and Al Horford in Gainesville, Troy Smith and Mike Conley in Columbus.
Oklahoma’s stars achieved similar levels of national recognition. Baker Mayfield’s youthful enthusiasm encapsulated the beauty of college football, while Buddy Hield’s versatility on the court was truly something to behold.
OU football and basketball fell flat after halftime in the College Football Playoff and in the Final Four — the former against Clemson and the latter against Villanova. The Sooners failed to score after the half against the Tigers in that CFP matchup, and their hardwood counterparts were outscored 53-23 by the Wildcats in that debacle of a Final Four contest.
Maybe Oklahoma struggles against large cats. Maybe OU’s uninspiring performances in such monumental games isn’t actually the biggest of deals.
Oklahoma’s success leading up to those games forces college sports fans to compare the enjoyment quotient of having a great season as opposed to doing so while also taking home the hardware.
Only two programs will claim the two most prominent titles in intercollegiate Division I athletics each year. Alabama did what Alabama does and snagged that oddly tall CFP trophy in January, but the Sooners were only one game away from facing the Tide. Meanwhile, OU basketball came awfully close — not really, but technically — to playing North Carolina for all the marbles.
The fact that one school actually came this close to rivaling the 2006-07 Florida Gators as two-sport champs ought to make fans of other colleges at least somewhat envious. And while OU fans continue to ruminate on what could have been, the journey — from late August through early April — has been a source of true indulgence for the Sooner faithful.
Any hey-good-job-almost-winning banners or plaques from this season that turn up in the athletic facilities in Norman will likely be greeted by a shrug from those who witnessed — let alone partook in — the postseason collapses.
But the slowly recovering OU fans can find solace in the fact that their teams were contending until the very end. Well, almost.

Last week, Amalie Iuel, a junior on the track and field team, spoke to the Daily Trojan in a one-on-one interview, where she gave insight into her life as an international student athlete, what her future goals are and more.
The junior heptathlete is having an amazing season so far. She set a Norwegian record for the women’s indoor 400m race at the New Mexico Classic, scored the most points by any college athlete in the heptathlon this season at the Sam Adams Combined Events Invitational and has consistently achieved personal records throughout the season.
Daily Trojan: Rumor is that you are trying to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Is this true? Would it be as a heptathlete?
Amalie Iuel: This is true. I would be competing for Norway. I haven’t quite decided whether I want to compete for the hurdles or for the heptathlon. Obviously, I have to hit the standards first and then make the choice. But, as of now, I think I have a better shot at the hurdles.
DT: Was being a heptathlete always the goal?
AI: Yeah I think it was always a big dream of mine. Carolina Klüft, she’s a Swedish heptathlete who was always my idol. I loved her. And, I always liked doing multiple events. I could never stick with one; it was way too boring.
DT: As a heptathlete, how do you have time to practice all of the events?
AI: I come in for the main sprint practices on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and then Saturday, if we don’t have a meet. Then, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’ll do the jumping events and the throws. Sometimes I’ll have to split up my practices, come in the morning, then come back later on and do some throws and some jumps
DT: Do you feel like some of your events suffer because of how much you have to practice?
AI: Yes. I feel like I lack points in the throwing events … Especially since I don’t look like a thrower as you can see [flexes]. I feel like I don’t get to throw as much as I’d like to.
DT: Do you have a favorite event?
AI: It has to be the long jump. There’s no rush with anything. You don’t have to go off of a gun. You don’t have to worry about knocking a bar over. You go at your own pace and you just jump.
DT: You are Norwegian, you were born in Denmark, you went to high school in Bangkok, and now you’re in L.A. for college. Is there somewhere you’d like to live permanently later on in life?
AI: I love L.A. I could definitely see myself staying here or going back home [Norway]. It’s a good place to start a family. I think I want to do what I did; I moved around a lot. It allowed me to experience a lot, so if I get a job that allows me to travel, I’d be OK with that.
DT: Are you trying to become a professional athlete? Or will you be looking for a “normal” job once you’re out of college?
AI: I’m looking to go pro. That’d be awesome! If I can’t do it here, I’ll go home and do it. That’s the overall goal. I want to keep running for as long as I can. Then I’ll start looking for a normal job; I’ll have my degree [at USC] as a backup.
DT: You graduated from a high school in Bangkok. What were the biggest differences in training there compared to here?
AI: Ugh … The heat! Bangkok has two seasons: hot and hotter. But you also have a rain season; in the fall it rains a lot, so it gets really, really humid. And with the rain comes the thunder and lightning, so practice gets interrupted a lot. And it’s not the kind of rain you see here. It’s intense! And in the summer time it just gets really, really, really hot.
DT: How are you dealing with living so far away from your parents and siblings?
AI: They live in Norway right now, but they’re moving to Dubai, where I also used to live a couple years ago. It sucks. I miss my family so much. I come from a big family: I have four siblings, so there’s seven of us in total. There’s always something going on. So I miss them a whole bunch.
 
DT: What motivates you to train and compete?
AI: I’m very competitive. I don’t like getting beat. Even like the smallest things, I take way too seriously. I always feel the need to be the best, even though it takes a long, long while to get there. But that’s my main goal, to hopefully win a medal someday.
DT: When did you know that competing in track and field is what you wanted to do?
AI: My parents threw me into it. I treated everything like a competition. They must have thought I was really annoying because of all of my energy.
I remember one time, I think I was 7, [my younger cousin] was 4, and I was like “Let’s race!” and I would beat her by a whole lot. I didn’t go easy on her like you typically would. No, I would go all out and I would stand there be like “Ha-ha! You lost!” So it was terrible. My parents were like, “You can’t keep doing this!” So, they put me in track and field. And I loved it, because I got to do what I love doing: competing and racing.
DT: What’s the most important thing your coaches have taught you — about life or about track and field?
AI: That you can achieve whatever you put your mind to.
DT: How did you celebrate breaking a Norwegian record?
AI: We went out to a barbecue place right after. I was choosing between one pound of ribs and two pounds, and everyone was saying, “No, no, no! You’re not gonna be able to finish!” So, me and couple of the guys [each] got the two pounds. And I slayed them. I mean, they had nothing on me.
DT: You play guitar and sing; what is your favorite song to cover?
AI: I like “Riptide” [by Vance Joy]. I like playing that; it’s a fun song to cover. I don’t get to do it as much anymore because I really don’t have much time on my hands.
DT: What is your favorite song to listen to (or band, or genre)?
AI: Favorite artist: Kygo. I need him to calm me down before a race.
DT: Favorite movie?
AI: Inception.
DT: Favorite meal?
AI: Sushi! Or like a medium-rare rib-eye steak! Very different but both so delicious! I’m not very picky with my food, but I’m a food lover.
DT: How do you relax?
AI: Netflix. Hulu. HBO GO.
DT: What is your dream vacation?
AI: I need to go to Australia. I always wanted to go. Or New Zealand, Peru. I don’t have one. I want to go everywhere. I want to explore.
DT: Describe Coach Caryl [Smith Gilbert] in a word?
AI: Intense.

Don’t Look Back: The 1990s at the Museum of Contemporary Art showcases the work MOCA acquired during that decade. Most of the pieces explore the political and social climate of the ’90s — LGBTQ rights, the AIDS crisis, the internet, Rodney King, the end of the Cold War. In the opening explanation, MOCA Chief Curator Helen Molesworth frames the show around the acquisition of the pieces: the process of deducing what will retain cultural significance for generations to come. However, “Don’t Look Back” as a title starkly contrasts Molesworth’s institutional concerns. A nod to D.A. Pennebaker’s Bob Dylan documentary by the same name, this title explores the maddening balance between artistic practice and public pressures of fame, commercial interest and the future.
“The Art World Can Suck My Proverbial Dick” and the space around it exemplifies this theme in gendered issues of art and the market wonderfully. The painting itself is a tongue-and-cheek, cartoon-style Sue Williams work that laments her exclusion from more serious circles of art-making. However, it is placed squarely opposite a massive Barbara Kruger piece, adding depth and nuance to both works. Kruger, a highly acclaimed female artist, seems to prove Williams’ critique invalid with not only her success, but the depth of her commentary as well. However, Kruger also comes from a design background, making her work highly commercial. While these two works vie for attention, the other two walls house a Llyn Foulkes painting and a John Baldessari diptych — two works that engage with pithy topics without the burden of a gendered reading.
“Import/Export Funk Office” as well was elegantly assembled by conceptual artist Renée Green. The space is clinical and intimidating from the outside, but thoroughly engaging within — full of books (everything from Frantz Fanon to Norman Mailer), movies playing, framed slang definitions and “funk stations.” There are four of these stations, each with its own set of headphones, iPod and library full of artists like Queen Latifah, Ice Cube and Public Enemy. However, the funk stations are marked “DATA” and the slang terms “LEXICON,” labeling these cultural phenomena as objects of scientific study. Though the work
is thoroughly entertaining, it maintains a deliberate distance, limiting the viewer to consumption rather than identification and prompting one to think more deeply about their relation to popular black culture.
“You Are Allowed to Touch Things,” on the other hand implicates the viewer in the content rather than alienating them. Living in a nook tucked in a back corner of the gallery, Jack Pierson’s movie marquee  message is aggressively contradicted by the docents. The interactive sentiment only applies to the Felix Gonzalez-Torres piece, a pile of silver wrapped hazelnut chocolates that viewers are encouraged to not only touch, but also consume. Of course, the Torres piece and the two other homoerotic works escorting the viewer into the room evoke the AIDS crisis given the time period. Torres’ piece deals directly with AIDS, as his candy piles are meant to evoke the withering away of the human form afflicted with the disease. In this way, the otherwise exciting process of touching things in art galleries becomes tinged with anxiety and guilt, as the viewer symbolically ingests an individual afflicted with AIDS. The initial desire to interact, consume, and “touch things” brought on by Pierson and Torres’ work becomes stifled by the lingering fear of death and disease.
The whimsy and horror of Pierson and Torres’ pieces carries over into “When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,” though in a much more hopeful way. This imitation domestic space just off the enormous main gallery is packed with dinosaur toys, images and patterns. It depicts a childlike fascination with the whimsy of the past — a theme that informs perfectly the Sarah Sze piece immediately to its right. Her installation, modeled after the idea of exponential technological growth, fills two dim rooms with whirring fans, fake plants and blinking lights exploding from a single looping extension cord. Her work applied the artist Mark Dion’s same hopeful whimsy to the future, though in an oddly dated way due to the objects used. Together, the two works set up a sense of wonderment at our position in the present, informed by a curated idea of the past and a goofy vision of the future. There is a reason MOCA chose the image of Mark Dion’s childhood bedroom installation to represent the whole show — not because the work is the best, but because it is the most evocative of the theme of seeing the past from a future present.

On Tuesday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released the second edition of their Vegan College Cookbook, that includes 275 “easy, cheap and delicious” recipes for college students.
In preparation for the launch of the book of recipes, PETA hosted their Vegan College Cookbook  launch party at the Bob Barker Building in Echo Park on April 2.
The event included a cooking demonstration and food sampling of a couple recipes from the cookbook that was available for purchase a couple of days before being released to the public.
The Vegan College Cookbook, catered to busy college students lacking many cooking utilities, boasts its convenient recipes — none of which require a stove. These simple recipes make vegan cooking easily accessible for college students. Originally released in 2009, the success of the first edition prompted the release of the 2016 second edition, which includes 40 new recipes, an updated recommended products section and a new cover.
Featured at the event was the seven-layer Mexican dip, eggless egg salad and peanut butter mousse. Presented by enthusiastic PETA employees, each sample burst with flavor. Luckily, taste does not supplant nutrition, as each dish contains healthy ingredients without sacrificing taste.
Marta Holmberg, co-author of the Vegan College Cookbook and Senior Director of Youth Outreach and Campaigns at peta2 (the youth division of PETA), demonstrated the preparation of these three dishes. She began making the seven-layer Mexican dip, which is comprised of vegan cream cheese and vegan taco seasoning, refried beans, guacamole, vegan cheddar cheese, salsa, lettuce and green onions. This seven-layer dish, served with tortilla chips is absolutely mouth-watering.
Holmberg next prepared the eggless egg salad, made mainly from tofu, vegan mayonnaise, chopped fresh parsley, sweet pickle relish, onion and celery. In addition to tasting like the real deal, the salad’s vibrant yellow hue, due to a small amount of mustard, further made this eggless salad indistinguishable from the original. Served on crackers in half scoops, the soft and savory salad was accentuated by the crunchy and mild cracker. Aside from being spread on crackers, this eggless egg salad can be spread on bread, incorporated into sandwiches or eaten alone.
Next up was a delectable dessert, the peanut butter mousse. Holmberg mixed three ingredients together: peanut butter, powdered sugar and food-processed tofu. The mousse, served in gallops on white spoons and topped with nuts and chocolate chips, is a delicious treat. For a health nut who refuses to prepare food with artificial sugar, the mousse would have been just as indulgent if made without powdered sugar and instead with a natural source of sugar, such as ripe fruit — a peanut butter banana mousse would be even better. That’s what is great about these recipes — they are guidelines, but modifications can be made for individual preferences.
After the food demonstration, the crowd gathered on the outdoor deck to indulge in more samples, take pictures in front of the peta2 backdrop, purchase the cookbook and engage in conversation with the friendly and personable PETA staff.
“Going vegan is healthier and also saves the environment as well as more than 100 animals’ lives every single year. According to a study by food-service provider Bon Appétit, the number of college students who identify themselves as vegetarian has risen by 50 percent [in four years following 2005] and the number of vegan students has more than doubled during the same period” Holmberg said.
She also mentions the large variety of easy recipes the book contains for college students. “PETA’s Vegan College Cookbook makes eating vegan in college super-easy — you’ll find everything from a Pancake in a Mug to One-Bite Pizzas in the cookbook. We focused on what college students already like to eat — we just made everything easier to make and took the meat, eggs and dairy foods out. Whether you’re a vegan newbie or a veteran, this cookbook is perfect for you.”
The Vegan College Cookbook can be purchased online on PETA’s website.

Yesterday, the Metropolitan Opera announced that famed soprano Kathleen Battle would return to the company for a recital later this year, 22 years after she was notoriously fired for “unprofessional actions.” Though the latter statement may seem a bit cryptic, those deeply familiar within the opera universe know that Battle was fired for her rampant diva behavior during staging rehearsals for the Met’s production of Donizetti’s La Fille du Régiment.
When I first heard the news of Battle’s return, I was overjoyed; in fact, I screamed. I have always been a huge fan of Battle. Regardless of her less-than-flattering behavior towards those she deemed “beneath” her, it would be foolish to demean her breathtaking artistry. And it isn’t just her musicality that I admire, but also the voice itself. It is a voice that is identifiable for its silvery timbre — one note and you know it’s Battle. And ultimately, what separates a great singer from an operatic legend is a voice that is that easily identifiable.
However, Battle’s firing from the Met was not taken lightly. In fact, it even marked a new beginning for the diva, or lack thereof. Opera may still be stereotypically associated with a grand character with ridiculous diva behavior; but there is a new prototype that has been emerging within the industry: the “anti-diva.”
Based on my own observations, I’ve noticed that the diva-esque stature is only being tolerated while on stage. Though it is still important for performers to maintain composure while in character, being a great colleague seems to be taking priority over being a great performer. In an age that places great importance on social media, seldom is anything kept a secret anymore; talk of exhibiting over-the-top behavior will spread like wildfire on the web. And though it is the singer’s prerogative whether or not they choose to be likeable, it really does seem like their behavior will take them farther in the long run.
Take for example mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, the 2015 winner of the Richard Tucker Award (also known as the Nobel Prize of opera). During the most recent Richard Tucker Gala that was broadcast in February, Barton was shown as down-to-earth and pragmatic in her behind-the-scenes shots; she was even seen chest-bumping fellow operatic star and anti-diva Christine Goerke, following their impeccable performance of the famous duet from Ponchielli’s La Gioconda together. Though they may have just been hamming it up for the cameras, I highly doubt that their anti-diva antics are a publicity stunt; I’ve heard from several people who have personally worked with Barton that she is an absolute joy to work with. Perhaps Barton’s cool demeanor is due to her Southern upbringing, or maybe she is just well-aware that being a phenomenal person to all will eventually garner her more respect during her tenure.
Furthermore, the 2016 Richard Tucker Award winner Tamara Wilson also exhibits anti-diva behavior. Back in my singer days, I had the pleasure of working with Wilson in a performance at Walt Disney Concert Hall. Wilson is a powerhouse — not only does she possess a voice that is larger than life, but she also has a stage presence that commands audiences to listen. She even maintains her own YouTube channel, entitled “Exit Stage Left,” in which she gives tips to those in the midst of their operatic studies while also showcasing her personality. However, what I remember most about my experience with Wilson was her personality; she chose to engage with her fellow peers, who were predominantly students, and not to separate herself from the chorus. Though the voice will remain immortal throughout history, maybe the key to immense success lies in being a good person.
Regardless, the anti-diva is not necessarily a new concept in opera. Singers of previous generations, including soprano Deborah Voigt and mezzo-sopranos Frederica von Stade and Joyce DiDonato, long ago exhibited sensible behavior both on and off the rehearsal space. Battle’s return to the Met stage marks not only a renowned comeback, but also serves as a reminder of what happens when a impressive ego steps on the wrong toes. Perhaps all it takes to make the immortal mortal is a 22-year hiatus.

Photo via Facebook (The Huntsman)
Once upon a time in a conference room at Universal Studios, a group of executives decided to take a relatively decent movie, get rid of one of the main characters, add four dwarves, an ice queen and a magic mirror to create The Huntsman: Winter’s War  — a  film that represents yet another dim result of studios digging into their movie vaults and churning out unoriginal movies in an effort to attract audiences to theaters or, in other words, print money.
Seemingly confused by the difference between a sequel and a prequel, The Huntsman: Winter’s War provides audiences with the backstory of queen sisters, Freya and Ravenna, portrayed by Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron, respectively. The film also delves into the stories of lovers Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain), as they try to stop Freya and Ravenna’s plans to conquer all the land in the kingdom from a noticeably absent Snow White.
With Snow White and the Huntsman four years in the past and Hemsworth’s international star power growing exponentially, it is not the least surprising that Universal would take advantage of the opportunity to create another film in the Snow White universe. The film’s possibilities of success were also in Universal’s favor, with the returning on-screen prowess of Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, and the addition of two strong female leads in Blunt as the icy anti-love queen Freya, and Jessica Chastain as the Irish-accented badass huntress to Hemsworth’s huntsman.
On paper, the dynamic acting foursome has every box checked for a successful movie, not to mention a franchise blockbuster film, but on film (or computer screen, considering the amount of visual effects used to bring this film to life), the result is not the fairest of them all. One would not blame this on the acting abilities of Hemsworth, Theron, Blunt or Chastain, for their impressive acting chops are on display in countless award-winning films, the fault lies in the script and its overwhelming inability to avoid the common cliches of the genre it tries to emulate. From the overused “Did Chris Hemsworth’s character die a third into the movie?” to the not-so-surprising twist ending, Universal’s effort to make a unique fairytale is, in fact, fantasy.
Luckily, the film, in an effort to attract a more diverse audience, has adopted a lighter tone, as it frequently relies on comedy. However, the humor provides some relief from the conventional action sequences audiences have grown to expect, but at the expense of Hemsworth’s superhero persona.
Another highlight of the film is the astounding special effects that fill at least 90 percent of every shot. The contribution of masterfully crafted special effects is unsurprising when considering that the director, Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, was the visual effects supervisor of the original 2012 film, a major step forward for the first-time director. Along with the stunning visual effects, the costume design by three-time Academy-Award winner Colleen Atwood were also scene-stealing, especially in the cases of Theron’s Ravenna and Blunt’s Freya.
The disappointing contribution to the fairytale movie landscape is especially apparent due to the abundance of classic film revivals over the past few years and many more to come. With successful films, critically and commercially, such as Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland (for which a sequel is being released on May 27), and failures, such as another Snow White saga Mirror Mirror, a strange twist on a classic story Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and a CGI mess Jack The Giant Slayer that are examples of failure in the genre.  While studios do not grasp the concept of overload, as evidenced by the weekly superhero explosion-fest, the importance of originality over quick theater delivery is key in the continued success of these movies.
In other words, these films should not focus solely on having a fast turn around from development to the  movie theater and should offer more creative approach to the adaptations. Fans can look forward to the remakes of an Emma Watson-led Beauty and the Beast and a Tim Burton-directed Dumbo  in the near cinematic future.
Overall, The Huntsman: Winter’s War is a mixed bag of somewhat witty humor, powerful leading ladies, stunning visual effects and masterful costume design. However, the weak plot outweighs the potentially redeeming qualities of the film. In the weeks leading up to the official start of the summer movie season, with plenty of potential critical and commercial cinematic stories to come, saving money on this film will be a good financial decision.

Whether you’re planning a trip over spring break or need a place to crash during your summer travels, Airbnb has proven to be a reliable resource for students. I certainly relied on it when I was traveling during my study abroad semester last spring.
Despite its convenience and affordability for travelers, Airbnb has been known to stir controversy for the impact it has on local housing markets and economies. In fact, a recent study found that the popular housing rental site could be costing the city of Los Angeles up to $41 million each year in potential tax revenue, since the company is not regulated in the same way hotels and other hospitality institutions are.
Given the rising popularity of websites like Airbnb — as well as the potentially negative impacts such rentals can have on the housing markets within the communities they reside — city officials can and should develop a plan to properly tax and regulate home-sharing companies.
Under existing city laws, it is illegal to rent properties for fewer than 30 days at a time in certain areas of Los Angeles. But this hasn’t stopped short-term housing rental websites like Airbnb from flourishing — all while enjoying exemption from regulations such as room taxes and assessment fees that traditional hotels are subject to. And though Airbnb is not considered to be enough like a hotel in order to be regulated like one, a significant number of Airbnb operators have mimicked hotel practices, turning their properties into short and long-term housing without paying anything close to the taxes and fees that are required of traditional hotels. The same study found that approximately 22 percent of Airbnb operators lease their properties for at least 180 days of the year, with 4 percent of operators offering their homes all year round. If a quarter of Airbnb leases are going to operate like a de facto hotel, it only makes sense that they be taxed like one.
This isn’t the first time Airbnb has sparked controversy for failing to pay its fair share of taxes at its residing city’s expense. In Airbnb’s hometown of San Francisco, the company launched a more than $8 million campaign against a city-wide initiative that would limit the home-sharing company from operating private rentals to 75 nights per year and require them to file quarterly reports with the city — seemingly in an attempt to protect the city’s already limited housing market. The company then went one step further by promoting a passive aggressive ad campaign which made reference to the approximately $12 million in hotel taxes it pays to the city each year, implying that the contribution was some sort of philanthropic gift as opposed to a civic obligation. When the ads were met with widespread anger by San Franciscans, the company issued an apology and promised to take the signs down.
Moreover, a study published last month in the Harvard Law and Policy Review found that short-term rentals such as Airbnb are contributing to an issue we’ve discussed previously in this column — Los Angeles’ growing housing crisis. With more and more landlords opting to lease their properties through short-term rental sites like Airbnb, the study concludes that the decrease in available housing for lease further contributes to displacement and gentrification of already housing-poor neighborhoods. By not applying stricter regulations, landlords are thus given the opportunity to make significantly more money on short-term rentals at the expense of their normal tenants. At least that’s what happened to Fairfax natives Carrie Kirshman and Nina Giovannetti last year when they were evicted from their apartments, only to later find them available for lease on Airbnb.
Airbnb came out against the study, blasting it as “inaccurate” and accusing it of attempting to “mislead and manipulate.” And while the home-sharing company is right to note that the study was financed by the American Hotel and Lodging Association — the country’s primary hospitality trade group — that doesn’t necessarily make its findings inaccurate, nor does it dismantle the important conversation that must be had about Airbnb’s effects on local hospitality and rental economies.
Presently, Airbnb enjoys the subtle distinction of not being classified as a hotel — and thus not being taxed like one — while also operating a significant number of rentals that operate exactly like a hotel would. And while Airbnb provides a cheap and reliable service to travelers and tourists, it shouldn’t do so at the expense of the local housing market and the economy. It is in light of this gray area that city officials must develop a plan to regulate and effectively tax short-term rentals.

As another week passes, so too does another incident of an outdated industry commissioning a misguided study to persuade consumers and policymakers that their competition is unfair and unregulated. Financed by the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a recent study has ascertained that if Airbnb units were levied the same taxes as hotels, then the Los Angeles city government could collect an extra $41 million in taxes. It comes on the heels of another study which claims that Airbnb is partially responsible for L.A.’s housing crisis. However, the natural conclusion of these studies — that Airbnb ought to be taxed into obscurity for the sake of the city’s economy — ignores the overwhelming evidence that not only do Airbnb rentals yield massive economic benefit for the private sector, but they also fill a functional void that hotels are simply incapable of filling.
Let us begin with the most foolish conclusion first, that Airbnb is responsible for L.A.’s housing crisis. No, the city of Los Angeles is responsible for L.A.’s housing crisis. As I have discussed in this column before, fallacious regulation after fallacious regulation has disincentivized housing development to a point of stagnation. As regulations inhibit housing development, demand increases and rental prices skyrocket. Furthermore, the idea that profit-hungry Angelenos are taking huge numbers of properties off the market to rent out on Airbnb is simply not backed up by common logic or math.
According to a study conducted by the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and commissioned by Airbnb, an Airbnb unit would need to be rented for 177 nights annually in L.A. in order for the homeowner to recuperate the costs of the original unit. However, in cities with the highest prevalence of Airbnb units, such as Santa Monica and Hollywood — which, coincidentally, are the areas where hotel price rises have effectively flatlined — that break-even point is even higher. This means that in order for the claim that people are taking housing off the market for Airbnb in droves to be true, most Airbnb units would have to be rented for at least 48.5 percent of the year and likely would have to be in much trendier areas. By contrast, a whopping 80 percent of Airbnb home listings are rented out for less than three months, not over half a year. In fact, only 8 percent of Airbnb home listings are rented out for more than half a year. Before you think that this study is cleverly ignoring short-term rentals, note that UCLA found that less than 1 percent of all L.A. housing units are rented for more than the break-even point of 177 nights total via Airbnb short-term rentals.
The issue of Airbnb’s taxation cannot be discussed without analyzing its private sector benefits. Researchers from the real estate and development consulting firm HR&A Advisors found that Airbnb renters in San Francisco contributed $56 million to the local economy annually, only $12.7 million of which went to host households. Because the majority of Airbnb users choose Airbnb over hotels purely for lower prices, the study found that guests who used Airbnb stayed an average of two extra days in San Francisco. If Los Angeles chooses to tax all Airbnb rentals as hotels, the economic benefit of Airbnb will be vastly diminished. In addition, Airbnb guests are more likely to stay in less central areas of a city, infusing smaller neighborhoods with plenty of unanticipated revenue. In a car-centric city such as L.A., the benefit of being able to choose from a wider variety of locations in which to stay can be priceless.
All of this is ignoring the fact that most Airbnb hosts are renting portions of their units simply to make their own rents. Adding another layer of taxation and regulation will do nothing to target the actual source of L.A.’s housing crisis — a lack of housing development — and it will once more usurp the individual’s rights to private property and throw the private sector under the bus in the pursuit of an ostensibly fair, antiquated economic playing field.

I agree with the other comment – this is so well done, i didn’t even realize I was reading a college newspaper – because it is and I didn’t! Your insight is appreciated.  I was the defendant in Chen v Kraft (2016), and an airbnb host since 2009, I had no idea the company would grow as it did, but I realized once it caught on, there was no stopping it. I had two teenagers my neighbors may not have appreciated much, they grew up and left, I no longer received child support and I had been laid off.I listed their empty room on craigslist and I was contacted by airbnb directly thru an ad on craigslist.  I signed up with airbnb, my landlord and I signed a written agreement as it had been suggested and very few guests actually came thru airbnb in 2009 or even 2010. I’d send my craigslist responses to the airbnb website to see the pictures of the room but I didn’t have but a few airbnb guests when I started..airbnb who??.  That would change and by 2012, I was busy corresponding with people all over the world, deciding who I wanted to host.  Every single airbnb guest was great.  My guests were ALL incredibly respectful,there was never one incident (the same could not be said about a few of the longer-term roommates I’d had), there was never a single complaint from anyone, ever. In fact my guests were ENJOYED by my neighbors both in the apartment building and in the neighboring houses.  And common sense would explain why we kept the entire building clean, and made constant improvements to the property.  Most of my guests used public transportation and they ALL, brought money to local businesses.  I only charged $30 a night when I started, hosting mostly yoga instructors in town to for teacher training courses, interns, UCLA students, people moving to LA who needed to find a place etc, journalists and a few actual “tourists”,   The money helped me pay the rent, I paid income tax AND I paid the occupancy tax to the city  My building sold at the end of 2012- to Attorney Louise Chen – who succeeded in her 2nd eviction attempt, evicting me for using the premises , for “an illegal purpose”, my purported violation of the single family zone which the multi-family building I lived in was located –  the “illegal purpose” of sharing my home, paying taxes, without any city involvement, and no actual violation, without a trial, a summary judgment in a summary proceeding. I appealed and the decision was affirmed. My failure to properly defend myself resulted in my homelessness, but the worst part of it all is my fraudulently procured eviction, affirmed on appeal, creates asinine case law.  Airbnb hosts share not only “real property” but “personal property” it
 can not be called a hotel, or bed and breakfast.  It is such a simple,
practical case of supply and demand and I have never myself witnessed what the media portrays airbnb to be…loud parties, destruction of property,
crime and criminals taking over neighborhoods..it’s all bullshit, special interest groups such as “keep our
neighborhoods first” (who are not really who they claim to be) – where are all
these thousands of tenants who were wrongly evicted?  who actually receives $300 a night every night of the month?  Are there not noise ordinances, police and special enforcement units in place in our city, fully staffed with city workers, for any reported nuisance abatement? I am completely astonished by the media propaganda, the constant blaming airbnb for the housing crisis, really? IT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER   Your article, however, makes sense – THANK YOU!
Tiana seems to be the only sane person in the entire opinion column of DT. 
This is so well done. I didn’t even realize I was reading a college newspaper.

“Sometimes, the threat is too immediate, the potential injury to others or the officer is too grave. When there is time, however, we should never take a life when we have the option of resolving a situation without doing so.”
This statement, made by Los Angeles Police Department Police Commission President Matt Johnson earlier this month, is exactly what everyone concerned about police brutality needed to hear. Incidents of shootings that result from situations that could have been defused are all too common in Los Angeles. LAPD’s change in policy to one that favors de-escalation and more in-depth review of shootings by officers signals a truly great step forward for the department and stands to address some of the biggest concerns that L.A. residents have about their police force. Approved two weeks ago, this new policy is remarkable for reinforcing non-lethal training and de-escalation techniques. It has the best chance of reducing the likelihood of unnecessary deaths caused by police action.
On August 11, 2014, Ezell Ford, a young schizophrenic man, was walking home in South Los Angeles around 8:20 p.m. A pair of LAPD officers attempted to arrest him on suspicion of drug possession, and after an officer pulled on Ford’s shoulder from behind, a fistfight ensued. Within 13 seconds, Ezell Ford was shot after reaching for the officer’s gun while both were on the ground. He died two hours later from his wounds.
At the Los Angeles Police Commission public hearing one year after the shooting, the biggest concern that community members had, including Ford’s family, was the never-ceasing question: Why weren’t less lethal alternatives used on the young, schizophrenic man when he was accosted by officers? Ford was previously arrested by one of the officers involved, and was known by community members and his family to be mentally ill. He was unarmed and doing nothing wrong prior to his attempted arrest. There were no drugs in his possession or at the scene of the incident. He reacted to being suddenly pulled from behind at night. It was a situation that, had the officers been trained to act more calmly and less physically, probably would have ended very differently. Had the officers been trained to primarily use the taser in their squad car, the night may have likewise ended very differently. The officers, evidently, were not.
It finally appears as if the Los Angeles Police Commission heard the voices of the people at that hearing and across the country, and took their comments to heart. De-escalation training, as well as making more non-lethal weapons and training available to officers, will go a long way toward ensuring that a situation like the one in which Ford lost his life will not be repeated.
However, the policy change is not without its critics. Jamie McBride, director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, an officer’s union, made the claim to the commission that “if an officer is killed as a result of this use-of-force policy that you want to revamp, their blood will be on your hands.”
He has a point. Reducing officer reliance on quick trigger fingers may indeed result in more officer deaths in split-second situations. However, the assumption that this is the norm ignores the overwhelming majority of stops and searches by police that do not reveal the presence of a firearm or other weapon.
Police officers must always react reasonably to situations, in line with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Graham v. Connor, et al. Sometimes that means the officer has a hand on his weapon. Sometimes that means that the officer speaks in a relaxed tone and attempts to calm a frantic suspect down before engaging with them further. From a legal and an ethical standpoint, reason, not paranoia, ought to guide the actions of L.A.’s finest.
The Los Angeles Police Commission made a wise choice in altering its policy to reflect an emphasis on the value of human life on both sides of the badge. Police officers’ lives are important, and so too are the lives of those they protect and serve. Higher accountability and a wider variety of non-lethal alternatives are indicative of a good start to an era of better policing in the world’s most interesting metropolis.
Other metropolitan police departments should take steps to mirror the LAPD’s decision in the interest of protecting citizens and keeping in line with federal standards. While a policy change alone will not end instances of police brutality or unnecessary shootings, an expression of commitment to those ends is necessary for police departments across the United States. It is very likely that after the LAPD’s new policy has remained in place for a length of time, its benefits will be laid bare, and it will serve as a model for similar changes nationwide.
Trevor Kehrer quotes an LAPD police union official. The official’s statement apparently addresses a situation where a police officer is so constrained by exquisitely restrictive policy toward dangerous persons, that “. . .if an officer is killed as a result of this use-of-force policy that you want to revamp, their blood will be on your hands.”
I submit that Trevor does not fully understand the perspective of those who grieve for violent criminals, psychotics and the like hurt or killed while endangering police doing their jobs. Those sympathetic to the violent criminals and psychotics likely do not care how many policemen are lost while performing their duties of protecting us and themselves.

I’m pretty sure I have a huge crush on my best friend, but I’m scared to tell him because I’m afraid he won’t feel the same way and it will ruin our friendship. Also, we’re seniors so I just don’t really see how this would even work out after graduating … what should I do?
You’re right. T-minus six weeks until graduation … He might not feel the same way …  And I suppose it may “ruin” your friendship if either of you are incredibly awkward people. But it might also end up being the best pairing since frat bros and Moreton Fig.
If this person is your best friend and you have it bad for him, he’s probably a swell guy. Is he not worth the risk of a hit to the ego? Don’t let your fear of rejection stop you from the chance to be with him! Telling a friend how you feel is terrifying, but your bond can probably transcend the awkwardness of unrequited feelings. Your friend might even be secretly harboring the same feelings, in which case you’re wasting precious time being together by having this internal struggle. There will never be an opportune time, you’ve just got to go for it before it’s really too late!
Be brave and surprise yourself. I leave you with the wise words of 2000s savant Hilary Duff … Why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance? If you lose a moment, you may lose a lot, so … why not? WHY NOT?!
