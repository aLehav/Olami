*Hey Siri, play “Sittin’ Up in My Room” by Brandy*
Asha Grant, Los Angeles native and owner of The Salt Eater’s Bookshop, believes this song is THE Black girl anthem.  It makes you want to grab your notebook and just jump on your bed.  This is the type of excitement I have when entering The Salt Eater’s Bookshop.  It is the equivalent of going over to your homegirl’s house where there are no skips on the playlist and the candles are always burning, patiently waiting for you to choose your next read.  And this is precisely why there is no one better to feature in my first installment of “Blacktopia.”  
 Grant is a Black woman and business owner in L.A. living out her dreams while giving back to her community.  She hosts events that allow people to bond over books in a space that encourages you to be vulnerable.  An added treat is that The Salt Eater’s Bookshop is located on Queen Street; is that a sign to visit or is that a sign to visit? 
The dictionary defines utopia as “an imagined place or state of things in which everything is perfect.”  I translate this as freedom from racially motivated injustice and freedom from constantly feeling like the minority.  A resting point.  A breath of fresh air.  A warm and cozy night surrounded by family.  Blacktopia is just that: a sprinkle of Black paradise found in our very own city of angels.    
I want to adventure and find these places of peace and share them with you all.  There are so many gems in L.A. that are found in Black spaces and they’re all rich with stories offering something to learn.  So whether you want to immerse yourself in Black culture, patronize Black businesses or you’re simply out of weekend plan ideas … come join me.
I had the privilege of speaking to Asha, who not only created a professional career for herself that made her community proud, but also stayed true to her identity and what is important to her.  That’s real power.   
7 Perfect Reasons To Go Visit The Salt Eater’s Bookshop with Asha Grant:
SJ: Who does your bookshop cater to and why?
AG: The bookstore is a meeting ground for Black girls and nonbinary folks, gender nonconforming folks [and] queer folks to not only come and read and fellowship over literature but also commune.  In L.A., we don’t have so many spaces that are dedicated to our own experiences,  so it’s really important to me to create a space where it could feel like home.
SJ: How can people that may not identify the same way benefit from this space?
AG: Everybody gets to benefit from the space.  A Black feminist concept is that when Black women are succeeding everyone else starts to.  It starts here.  It’s nice to see others feel connected to the space that aren’t necessarily the point of the space.  And the stories are good!  It’s not even just on some ‘Oh you should read this to step out of your own shoes.’  This is some good shit.  You’re missing out on so much when you deny yourself or believe a buy-in about us.  Just imagine if you didn’t listen to Black music!
SJ: What do you say to those readers that want to read or go as far as buying the books, but can never find the time to actually start?
AG: Now more than ever we are just bombarded by so many media platforms.  Everyone is fighting for your attention.  Reading is a really special activity because it is something that you can do on your own.  But, it requires another level of personal intimacy between you and the work.  I think that not spending all your time scrolling really makes a difference in your week and in your night when you take some time to be quiet with yourself and immerse yourself in the story, even listening to an audiobook while eating. It feels like you don’t have the time, but we don’t really make the time.  Once I start reading, I remember how fun it is, like I’m really enjoying myself.  That’s why our Noprah’s book club is perfect because all we read are wild, ratchet books and it’s a really great escape.  I have a friend that sets a timer every day to read for five minutes because no matter what, we always have five minutes.  I’ve been recommending that to people that are trying to get back into reading because when the timer is up, you almost always never want to stop.  
SJ: What are must reads we should start out with when visiting?
AG: My number one favorite book ever and this is ever, in life is “Homegoing” by Yaa Gyasi.  This book changed my life and changed the way I look at myself as a Black woman in America.  “The Vanishing Half” by Brit Bennett,  phenomenal.  “Bone Black: Memories of Black Girl Hood” by bell hooks.  Her memoir, especially now that she’s passed, is important for people to familiarize with who she was growing up.  She reminds me so much of me.  To be able to read someone like her and find similarities is just so amazing.  She even has a preface in the beginning that is so magical.
SJ: Take me through starting your own business in L.A. as a Black woman, and what nuggets can you give us young entrepreneurs?
AG: Now is always the right time to take your dreams seriously.  Don’t feel like you have to wait for someone to give you permission to go for something or that you have to have a certain qualification in order to move forward on your goals because you really don’t.  The difference between you and everyone else is just your courage. Many of us that are Black or women really feel like we have to prove ourselves to a certain extent or we have imposter syndrome that is holding us back.  But there are people out here that are putting out less quality than we put out and what we continue to put out.  
SJ: With lots to multi-task, how do you incorporate self-care for a healthy work/life balance?
AG: I’m no good to anybody if I’m no good to myself.  One thing I do for the store is seasonal breaks.  I need to rest too and everybody else needs to rest.  I’m not interested in participating in capitalism that is going to end up killing me.  The people will be there.
SJ: What do you feel that is special about your store that the young college student can gain?
AG: It’s an inspiring and imaginative place to get the wheels turning.  Also, you need a space outside of the rigidity of academia to remind yourself that books and words and ideas and theories can exist and function in different ways.  In more expansive ways and more freeing ways.  Sometimes, we need to pleasure read and remind ourselves that books are not just meant for you to consume and regurgitate.

Attendees were clad in merch littered with homemade buttons and patches, shouting about how they came from hundreds of miles away for this one show. The smell of weed and cigarettes hung heavy in the air – and all the while the median age had to be at least 58 years old. 
The Who, the seminal British rock band whose hits have been heard all over the world, took center stage at the Hollywood Bowl Tuesday to a packed house. Thousands of fans spent what would have otherwise been an uneventful weekday night enjoying the still rockin’ tunes played by The Who as effortlessly as if it was still 1970. As you walked up to the entrance, you could hear snippets of conversation from die-hard fans, eagerly describing previous tours and debating which venue was best to enjoy their classic rock sounds. 
The Who, formed in 1964 by Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwhistle and Keith Moon, is one of the biggest bands of all time, from their rock opera “Tommy” going double platinum in the U.S. to their classic 1971 album “Who’s Next” going triple platinum in the U.S. and selling more than 100 million records worldwide. Their songs dominate classic rock radio stations, and they’re probably one of your dad’s favorite bands. 
Original members of the band, Townshend and Daltrey arrived on stage to riotous cheers and applause. Despite their older age, Townshend and Daltrey proved that they still have what it takes to rock. They were accompanied by both their touring band and a small orchestra, which gave their performance a rich and almost cinematic feel that the original recordings lack. There was a kinetic energy in the air at the Bowl that night, as both the band and fans reflected on what it means to play and listen to all the hits in such a classic venue, where the band played before years prior. 
Townshend showcased his still-impressive guitar skills as he ripped away on hit single “Pinball Wizard” from “Tommy,” while Daltrey’s vocals on a particularly rousing rendition of “Won’t Get Fooled Again” off “Who’s Next” was otherworldly. It’s amazing that even more than 50 years after the band’s formation, they are still fit and fired up enough to play for close to two hours. The crowd loved the passion the band was pouring into every song, with whoops, shouts and cheers following every track. 
Townshend and Daltrey were quite the jokers, sprinkling in amusing anecdotes and small personal messages between songs. Townshend cracked a joke about dilated pupils and getting stoned before they moved into a psychedelic rendition of “Eminence Front”, complete with pulsing green and blue lights that turned the stage into a trip of its own. 
The technical design of the tour was fantastic, as the lights behind the band played kaleidoscope colors, while light rods mixed in between the orchestra players and the band flashed in time with the music. The iconic concentric circles of the Bowl were lit up in mind-bending swirling colors, and sparkles glittered on the outside edge of the Bowl. 
The inclusion of the orchestra made The Who’s already timeless tracks even more beautiful. A particularly stunning example of this was “Behind Blue Eyes”, where Townshend and Daltrey were assisted by Katie Jacoby on violin, Audrey Snyder on cello, and Randy Landau on five-string bass. The song was stripped back, and Daltrey’s vocals soared above the beautiful blending of the string accompaniment. The crowd sang along, even overpowering Daltrey at times. The passion and love that everyone felt for the band was evident. Despite signs of physical aging on the outside, it was clear that everyone at the concert, from the band to the fans, were young in spirit and still as hungry as ever to rock. 
Of course, the show had to end with possibly their biggest hit, “Baba O’Riley.” Ranked #159 on Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Songs of All Time,” the iconic opening synth sent the entire Bowl into a frenzy, with people pulling their friends to their feet and wrapping their arms around each other to belt their hearts out. Daltrey led the crowd into a triumphant yell of “They’re all wasted” to close out the show while Townshend shredded away on his guitar to a standing ovation. 
Walking back to the car, it was clear everyone in the crowd was buoyed on a wave of jubilance at seeing one of the greatest bands of all time still play as if they were in their prime. Their tour, aptly titled “The Who Hits Back!,” proved that The Who really can hit back, and indeed, hit every note in just the right way.

Drake is one of the biggest names in music and 21 Savage is a juggernaut in the rap world. That’s why when the Canadian superstar announced that the two would team up for a full-length album, “Her Loss,” in his music video for “Jimmy Cooks,” it grabbed the rap world’s attention. With Drake and 21 Savage dropping their collab album Thursday, hip-hop fanatics have gone into a frenzy. Why not look back at some collaborative efforts that were big for their time or might have gone unnoticed? 
“What A Time To Be Alive”
Why not start the list off with Drizzy, considering he’s the main focus of the rap game for many and some people’s G.O.A.T. Back in 2015, Drake and Future linked up to come out with “What A Time To Be Alive.” This album was one for the ages considering that both artists were at the peak of their careers, with Drake coming off of “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” and Future coming off of one of, if not, his best work to date: “DS2.” It produced one of the jams of the summer back in 2015, with “Jumpman” consuming a lot of play time on the radio and people’s speakers. Other hot tracks include “Diamonds Dancing,” “Digital Dash” and “30 for 30 Freestyle.”
“Without Warning”
And now let’s mention 21 Savage and his collaborative effort with Offset, “Without Warning.” The Georgian duo might not have actually collaborated throughout the entire project, with each stealing their own moments. 21 Savage owning “My Choppa Hate Ni**as*” and Offset went off on “Ric Flair Drip.” While the 2017 project totaled only 10 tracks coming out to 33 minutes, there’s multiple tracks to go back to like “Ghostface Killer.”  
“Revenge of the Dreamers III”
While this may not be a textbook collaboration project, this is one of the best projects that features a whole record collective and their affiliates. J. Cole’s Dreamville label worked together to create an 18-track long album full of rap’s more established stars and some of its up-and-coming prospects back in 2019. Some of its highlight tracks include “Under The Sun,” which contains J.Cole, Lute and DaBaby, “Costa Rica,” which showcases nine, yes nine, artists on a 3-minute-37 second track – insanity – and manage to make it sound good and “Sacrifices,” the final track of the album which is a heartfelt ending to the project featuring Johnny Venus of EARTHGANG, Smino, Saba and a crooning J.Cole. Overall, it was one of the better drops of 2019 which also saw “IGOR,” “The Lost Boy” and “Psychodrama” come out that same year.
“Escape From New York”
Taking it to the East Coast, specifically Brooklyn, NY, “Escape From New York” had a good amount of tracks that might have flown under some people’s noses in 2019. The hip-hop supergroup, Beast Coast, which is an amalgamation of three other rap groups, Pro Era, Flatbush Zombies and The Underachievers,  released a 13-track long project that embodies a modern form of east coast hip-hop. Standout tracks for this project include “Left Hand,” “Problemz,” “Distance” and “Last Choir.” 
“Madvillainy”
This one’s a throwback and a half and one that many may not have checked out, but MF DOOM’s 2004 collab project with Madlib, “Madvillainy,” is one to look into. The late rapper provided one of hip-hop’s best projects that didn’t go mainstream. Madlib’s main focus on this project is his production throughout the album. And, MF DOOM delivers his bars as usual which is always a treat. Tracks to listen to are “Rhinestone Cowboy,” “All Caps,” “Accordion” and “Eye,” which is a track that focuses on the feature Stacy Epps.
“Watch the Throne”
This one’s a classic. That’s all that needs to be said. Kanye West and Jay-Z’s collab album, “Watch The Throne,” showcased the pair’s chemistry. The two have years of experience working together, with their relationship dating back to 2000 when Kanye was producing beats for HOV. For the New York legend, it was an album to remind the public that he still had it in him. And for Ye, it’s a year after arguably his greatest project to date, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” so he was still at his creative peak. Some standout tracks from this project include “No Church In The Wild” which features Frank Ocean, “Ni**as in Paris,” “Otis” and “Made in America.”
And as this is coming off the press, all there is to say is that 21 Savage brought Drizzy out with some absolute tunes. A very happy Friday y’all.

Warm afternoon light accompanied students’ hushed whispers ahead of the screening of “Breaking Point,” a film about the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the democratic revolution average Ukrainian citizens faced, at Mudd Hall Tuesday. Crossroads, a project hoping to bring together communities that are suffering due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine through history, personal narratives and discussion,  hosted the event.
 Some students were unsure of what to expect going into the screening. Marcel Apatewen, a sophomore majoring in health and human sciences, noted that he had not heard of the documentary prior to the event. 
“[I am expecting a] more in-depth look about what’s going on in the country currently, what’s been happening in the country since it has been out of the major news cycle,” Apatewen said.
Elizabeth Allen, a freshman majoring in psychology, recalled lectures at her high school where students were able to learn more about the crisis in Ukraine after the war broke out earlier in 2022.
“I’m interested [in doing] the same thing here and [seeing] how it’s progressed,” Allen said. 
The documentary follows the beginning of the war in Ukraine from 2014 to 2016 and their fight for democracy through the lives of average Ukrainian people. These Ukrainians, including a theater director,  rabbi,  doctor,  reporter,  lawyer, soldier and journalist, fought the Russian invasion just after the Maidan Revolution. The struggle they face to continue their lives, in light of the invasion and revolution, changed forever as they fought to rebuild the government. The documentary follows these individuals through many issues they face, including death and destruction. 
The screening was followed by a Q&A panel with one of the directors of the documentary, Mark Jonathan Harris, an Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker and distinguished professor at the School of Cinematic Arts. Students were able to engage in conversation with and ask questions to Harris. 
Shwetha Rajmohan, a freshman majoring in political science and economics, was particularly distressed by the documentary because of the similar issues that were echoed today in the current Ukraine and Russia war. 
“To be in 2022, watching this 2016 documentary, and to be six years out after that with the war still having gotten worse is really discouraging and disheartening,” Rajmohan said.  “We saw a lot of bloodshed in film, and the loss of not just soldiers, but children and families, and just overall destruction. And it was just really tough to watch.”
Rajmohan asserted that she believed more students should know about Ukraine and Russia. 
“Sometimes things that are occurring in places far away can just feel far away, but when you are seeing actual war and bloodshed,  it feels a lot more real,” she said. 
The disheartening feeling was not one Rajmohan faced alone, as that feeling of sadness permeated the room throughout the screening. While the light outside Mudd Hall faded to darkness, the documentary awakened students’ minds about the need for activism to support Ukraine. 
Crossroads is continuing to hold events throughout the next semester to continue to support those affected by the war in Ukraine. To help support the Crossroads project, visit https://dornsife.usc.edu/crossroads/.

The USC School of Architecture will implement a new undergraduate degree program for students to learn aspects of product and set design, museum curation and app development. 
The new bachelor of science in Architecture and Inventive Technologies takes four years to complete, compared to the five-year bachelor of architecture degree, and prepares its students for careers in alternate jobs outside the standard architectural realm. 
“It’s much more of an entrepreneurial type of degree, trying to look for a hole in the market, designing a product for it and then developing a business around it,” said Doris Sung, director of undergraduate architecture programs and associate professor of architecture. 
Sung and her colleagues understand that not every student wants to complete the original five-year bachelor’s program and become a licensed architect, so instead, the BSA+IT program offers an alternative and doesn’t come with the pressure of passing the licensure exam come graduation. 
While the BSA+IT program is a four-year degree with 128 units, there is also an optional 131-unit track that prepares students for advanced placement in a top-rated master’s of architecture program at USC. 
“I think the students are looking for that kind of innovation,” Sung said. “We have a lot of students who come into the school and are looking for alternative careers.”
The program began taking applicants for Fall 2023 this past August, prompting positive reactions from students in the school like Corinne Suthard, a freshman majoring in architecture. While she was unable to apply to this specific program, she believes the creation of it will be beneficial. 
“It seems very innovative, and in our world that’s constantly advancing, I think that’s very important,” Suthard said. 
Sung said that the architecture and innovative technologies program can’t be found at any other university. 
“It’s really out there,” Sung said. “[We’re] courageously trying to build it and tap into the resources of young people and education.”
The new major is attracting many students with unique preferred learning styles, such as Eva Cazar, a freshman majoring in architecture. After taking an architecture class in high school, she knew it was the path for her. 
“I always was kind of a crafty person, and I think I’m very creative. I think it was always something I was interested in,” Cazar said. 
Along with being “curious and spatially minded,” Sung agrees that creativity is a necessity when it comes to architecture.
“We believe that because when you make things with your own hands and understand the craft behind it is when you can actually understand things like manufacturing,” Sung said. “We want to look for makers and doers.” 
The program’s curriculum involves foundation-based seminars that students will take each semester along with a workshop. In the workshops, students will learn how to use various digital design tools, and they will become comfortable working in the school’s maker lab and working in teams.
“A lot of these things can’t be done in isolation,” Sung said. “It’s not a competitive type of atmosphere that we’re trying to generate, but something that is trying to raise the level of everybody [together].”
Sung said that the School of Architecture is also geared towards the idea of creating a citizen architect —  an architect that thinks about equity and solutions as a top priority. Citizen architects may look at issues such as combating climate change, increasing affordability or improving human wellness. 
“An architectural panel can be designed to [absorb] smog, for example, and do it in a way that’s affordable in all types of places of the world,” Sung said. 
This project is one of the many types of projects a BSA+IT student will be able to venture into, and it represents the new technologies being used to create positive change in the world.  
“It’s great that USC is taking these steps and keeping up with the times,” Suthard said. “It makes me confident that I’m getting the best and very well-rounded education.”
The program administrators at the School of Architecture understand the importance of  keeping pace with the changing world, and they are hopeful this program will be the start to a future of sustainable and technological advancements in architecture. 
“There’s a need for this sort of education,” Sung said. “What we’re trying to do in the School of Architecture is fill that need.”

Wednesday, Oct. 26 was Rev. Brandon Harris’ third official day as USC’s associate dean of religious and spiritual life. His office was still bare, though he found the time to move his two gray couches to the corner of the room — just in front of the door. Faint jazz music spilled into the lobby of room 106 in the University Religious Center. 
Raised in Rochester from 1995 to 2009, Harris grew up in a Pentecostal home but a multi-faith family; his uncle was an imam — a person who leads prayer in a Mosque — and others were Protestant, Catholic or secular. His father is a sixth grade teacher and his sister, along with all of his uncles, are professors.
“[Becoming Associate Dean of Religious Life] was a big surprise in the storyline of my life. We were very comfortable in D.C., and my wife received an opportunity in L.A.,” Harris said. “I was here in L.A. preaching at a church, and I saw the application while I was sitting in LAX, and before I got on my flight, I submitted my résumé.”
As Harris grew up and questions about his faith mounted, he made the decision to leave the Pentecostal tradition during the four years he spent at Lincoln University, a historically Black college in Pennsylvania. At Lincoln, he grew close with a professor from his Introduction to Religion class, Methodist minister Dr. Mel Leaman.
“He was really cool, he would hang out on the quad, throw footballs with students. He’d be in the dining hall. I was like, ‘This guy is a normal human being! He’s religious. There’s something to this,’” Harris said.
In his office, Harris would question Leaman about his faith constantly and explored what it meant to be a person of faith. One day, Leaman offered Harris an intern position at his Methodist church — and he accepted. 
Coming to USC was a surprise to Harris, he said, especially since administrative positions such as these have little turnover. However, he was eager to engage in the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life’s mission. 
“Fifty percent of our students identify as secular, non-denominational. So what does it mean to be an Office of Religious Life?” Harris said. “I wanted to join a team that was thinking about the future of religion that was willing to be innovative and creative and willing to think outside of the box.”
Harris first took note of the innovative work at ORSL during his time at Georgetown University as a chaplain of the law school, a position he took after earning his master’s degree from Emory University in 2016. 
During his time at Emory, Harris was officially ordained as a Baptist minister at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, known for one of its former co-pastors, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and United States Sen. Raphael Warnock, the current senior pastor at Ebenezer Church, along with many other church members helped shape Harris’ outlook on life.
“For me, [Ebenezer Baptist Church] was a place that, when I was new to a new city, when I was new to the South, it was a place that became home,” Harris said. “It taught me to balance the commitment to social justice, a commitment to a deep sort of spirituality, and yet also being engaged in the world.”
When he arrived at the Georgetown law school, Harris converted a Bible study group attended by three people into a social justice book club which grew to about 15 to 20 people. While the book club first examined social justice from a spiritual perspective, Harris expanded the conversation to people of any belief system. 
Harris moved on from Georgetown and served as the Senior Minister of the Peoples Congregational United Church of Christ in 2019. During the coronavirus pandemic, Harris conducted 51 funeral services.
Now, as an associate dean of religious and spiritual life, Harris’ role is to bring his attention to the needs of students at USC regardless of their belief system. This consists of duties such as individual counseling, creating programs for students and helping oversee over 80 student religious groups on campus. Reverend Harris also hopes to provide support for students of color at USC. 
“[The Rev.] Howard Thurman says that our main work is to help us find our common humanity,” Harris said. “So that’s my job, to help us find our common humanity: what makes us more alike than what makes us different. So I can enter into a mosque, I can enter into a synagogue, I can go to puja, I can enter into relationships with people who are from different backgrounds because we share a common humanity.”
Following in the footsteps of Rev. Dr. Thurman is something Harris and Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni have in common. 
“He walks in the footsteps of this amazing person who was a chaplain, was a professor and was a civil rights leader,” Soni said. “We all walk in the lineage of the people who we admire. But, I think what we can do as university professionals is create new lineages for our students to walk into.” 
To Associate Dean of Religious Life Vanessa Gomez Brake, Harris was a perfect fit for the job from the start — the only person among all of the initial screening candidates whom she rated a 10 out of 10. Thanks to a document Associate Dean Gomez Brake spearheaded to help in his transition, Harris’ next few months will be filled with meetings with student religious groups, campus religious directors and the campus cultural centers.
“What I found with him amongst the other candidates was [that] our conversation flowed naturally,” Gomez Brake said. “[Our work] can be so challenging at times. I need someone who can just be present for me as well, because we provide care for each other in our professional setting. We provide each other support for those tough times.”

Troy Camp, the University’s oldest and largest service organization, is holding its annual “Pass the Can” fundraiser at tomorrow’s homecoming football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
The fundraiser began in the 1960s and has been an annual tradition of the club ever since. During the event, club members, alongside volunteers, help pass milk jugs across the stadium to raise money. 
“Pass the Can is by far our biggest and most recognizable event,” said Soham Saxena, co-executive director of the organization and a senior majoring in economics and political science. 
The organization will also celebrate its 75th anniversary next year — prompting their new fundraising goal of $75,000 to commemorate the landmark. According to Saxena, Troy Camp raised roughly $68,000 last year.
Funds raised from Pass the Can will go towards the organization’s week-long summer camp geared towards third through fifth graders. 
“We’re also unique in that because we’re a student organization, we have no administrative or salary costs,” said Saxena. “It’s not like money’s coming in and being used to pay for people’s salaries. It’s going directly towards events and things that are utilized for the kids we serve.”
Troy Camp is accepting volunteers to participate and help in Pass the Can, who can be students or non-USC students as long as they are over the age of 18, or accompanied by an adult if not. Anyone who volunteers receives a free ticket to the football game along with a T-shirt. Volunteers will check in in front of Mudd Hall before the game to receive their ticket, shirt and training on what to do. 
As director of fundraising for Pass the Can in Troy Camp, Joy Jaensubhakij manages all the sponsorships for the fundraiser and organizes all key aspects of the event itself. 
“We’re really excited about the amount of people who have signed up to volunteer and help out and just getting to show the USC community what Troy Camp’s all about,” said Jaensubhakij, a junior majoring in theater. 
Fundraising for Pass the Can traditionally involves putting cash or coins into the milk jugs, but since many people do not carry around cash anymore, the club has adapted and also includes online payment options. 
Troy Camp is dedicated to providing long-term mentorship along with academic enrichment services to the youth in the South Los Angeles area near campus — they work with around 900 students and end up taking about 200 to summer camp. 
“I think that everything we do comes back to the long-term mentorship we provide,” PJ Hughes, a co-executive director of Troy Camp and a senior majoring in economics, said. “That’s our entire mission — inspiring curiosity and offering a helping hand to kids who we genuinely care about more than anything.”
The organization works with students throughout a variety of age ranges, from elementary school all the way up to high school. Due to this, some students that the Troy Camp counselors work with end up being in the program for over eight to 10 years. 
“Mentorship is something that I fully believe in,” Hughes said. “It’s these long-term bonds that are rather difficult for people to get in college a lot of the time, but I think are super amazing and really help kind of connect USC to the local community.”
This is the first year Troy Camp has had their programming fully in person since before the coronavirus pandemic, so they have completely relaunched the program to be the way it was before. 
“It is a huge deal for us,” Saxena said. “It’s really important that we raise as much as we can because everything’s more expensive now and we want to be able to provide our kids with as many amazing experiences as possible.”

Now that we are in the throes of the midterm election, I urge you to look around. Political signage is everywhere, and that makes the friction surrounding us unavoidable. When bright white fonts blare at you from every direction, you are forced to pay attention.
Data from the Pew Research Center shows that partisan hostility is on the rise; not only do opposing parties not believe in the other party’s platform, but they’re more likely now than ever to characterize members of the opposing party as “closed-minded, dishonest, immoral, unintelligent, and lazy.” Political polarization is on the rise — and that isn’t a good thing for any party, or frankly, any citizen. 
One solution to this partisan division is to prevent political discourse almost completely. In my neighborhood back home, the homeowner’s association has a political yard sign ban. In some ways, such a policy is helpful and comfortable. A neighborhood should be a safe place, free from the hostility politics can bring. Even if politics seem like something that can be put aside, judging and holding biases are part of what makes us human, unleashing a Pandora’s box of unsaid tension and strain. When politics and partisanship permeate so much of modern media and everyday interactions, it feels necessary to have some respite. 
Political signage can be polarizing, if not dangerous. Yard signs can be the targets of vandalism and theft. Just last week in Pennsylvania, a homeowner attempted to remove an unauthorized campaign sign from their lawn, and found it lined with razor blades.  During the divisive 2020 presidential election, two neighboring houses in my hometown on a particularly busy street dotted their entire lawns with huge opposing blue and red signposts. After a few weeks, one house added a “Honk for law and order – vote Republican” sign. The blaring honks heard every day while driving on that street were an apt metaphor for the political polarization poisoning neighborhoods, with a singular sign affecting all the people in the community. 
I like not having to worry about people honking their horns all day and night as they drive past my house. I like being able to chat with my neighbors without resenting them for their beliefs in the back of my mind. I like to feel safe and have peace of mind, not worrying about being shunned or even hurt for my personal views. 
Nobody exists above the plane of politics. I think it’s naive and ignorant to think that a world without politics can even exist. How can a neighborhood be a “politics-free zone” when elected officials and the laws they make affect that very neighborhood? Furthermore, political sign bans fail to serve their basic function of eliminating politics from the neighborhood sphere, because the bans themselves are inherently political acts. To make a community “apolitical” is to take a very specific stance; it means that the status quo is accepted, that complacency and, by extension, complicity, are not only adopted, but also accepted. An apolitical world is simply an endorsement of the existing state of affairs. Neutrality is a vote for those already in power. Under the guise of discouraging outward political expression for the sake of harmony, political sign bans actually push a clear agenda in a world where the apolitical is intrinsically political. 
What’s more is that such bans attempt to mask the political significance and voting power of political signs. Political signage, at its core, calls for action. Yard signs urge civic participation and raise name recognition for candidates. They contribute and aggregate to create a better-informed community. They can even have direct effects on election results. Political scientist Donald Green of Columbia University estimates that political signs can have “somewhere between 1 and 2 percentage points on average” of an effect on election results. With elections as divisive as late, those numbers aren’t something to scoff at. 
In states like California, where state law prohibits political sign bans, there is no such thing as a political vacuum. Campaign slogans line bus stops and neighborhood walks, no matter where you look. You don’t get to hide from the realities of politics. So let political signage bans be a symbol of both the complacency and ignorance plaguing our communities. Political hostility and polarization can be ugly and politics uncomfortable. But, it is in the uncomfortable that we can ask ourselves what we truly value, what we believe in and what we’re willing to sacrifice for it. It is in the uncomfortable that we can reckon with what we disagree with and what seems wrong. It is through discourse and discussion, not in silence and apathy, that we can try and find solutions.

Recently, USC shunned community skaters from lingering on campus through a variety of unnecessary measures. In addition to their already anti-skater and anti-homeless architecture, they transformed a once open and unused space that was freely used by community skateboarders into a fence with a laminated paper sign reading, “CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE,” “NO SKATEBOARDERS.” 
For too many of us, this may seem like an isolated incident of a private institution rightfully protecting its property. However, what happens when we broaden our perspectives and defamiliarize ourselves with what is normalized at USC? 
What if we look at how gates surround the campus and how on-campus libraries close to the community after 9 p.m.? What if we question how the existence of yellow jackets is to keep others out of the University rather than merely keeping students safe? What stereotypes do these practices perpetuate about the communities of color around us, and more importantly, what message do these practices tell members of the South Central community? 
Writer and scholar Gloria E. Anzuldúa wrote about colonization and the United States-Mexico border through a lens of understanding the collective trauma of being othered in space, writing “borders are set up to define the places that are safe and unsafe, to distinguish us from them.” 
She described the U.S.-Mexico border as una herida abierta, an open wound that is constantly being tethered and recut. Anzuldúa also wrote about the term “borderland,” which is the result of the “emotional residue of an unnatural boundary.” 
“Los atravesados live here: the squint-eyed, the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel, the mulatto, the half-bred, the half-dead,” she said. Through Anzuldúa’s work, we can understand borders, restrictions and gates as not just physical, but also as ideas that carry symbolic meaning and emotional weight. 
Paula Acedo, a sophomore majoring in geodesign, focuses her work at USC on bringing education and access back to the Boyle Heights community she comes from. Acedo offers a valuable perspective as to what it is like to experience USC — and the effects of its gentrification, privatization of space and displacement of the surrounding community — from a short distance. 
“Instead of making them feel that they are important and that we value where they come from, and we aren’t here to destroy … we give off the impression that they don’t matter; that just money, just bills, just the USC name, making it bigger and better is the only thing that matters,” Acedo said. 
In analyzing increased restrictions from USC, we must also look at the attitudes of the Los Angeles police and infrastructure that have intentionally fostered a strong anti-skater culture which is often overly criminalized. 
Earving Garcia, a 26-year-old skater from the L.A. community describes skating near USC as a “nice, pretty buttery spot,” especially given that most good skate spots are found at the “outskirts in the smaller cities, not this main city,” with the closest skate park about a 35-minute walk from USC — likely an intentional move by the institutional giant given its power in controlling development surrounding the area.  
However, these areas aren’t just convenient skate spots; they have become a community in itself. While they aren’t as formal or posh as the cultural centers on campus, it’s where people came to exist and support one another. 
Benjamin Chai, a senior majoring in cyber operations, has been skating at USC since freshman year and loves the open lot. 
“Bro, that place was a [fuckin] community center,” Chai said. “It wasn’t just skating; people pull up there to chill, I met so many friends there.” 
Acedo calls for reform of University policies that restrict space from skaters coming to USC from the community. 
“Especially in a community of color … you are not prioritizing your health. A lot of these students come from troubled households,” Acedo said. “A lot of them are unhoused, and when you take away the one outlet they have to be able to separate themselves from the already hard life at home, you are not letting society level up. And you preach so much about, ‘We need things to change,’ ‘Why is there so much crime?’ You’re not giving them any other option but to cause crime.”
USC could use this open space as a literal and metaphorical means of showing members of the South Central community that they matter to us and that we have space for them, their outlets and their talents — that we do not view their existence as inherently disruptive, but instead as something valuable to our campus culture. 
If they really wanted to, USC could easily make the vacant basketball lot previously used for skating open. These ideas might seem radical, but would they really be that difficult for an institution with an $8.12 billion endowment to execute?
Instead, USC will continue to make what’s old new, reinforcing what Anzuldúa famously noted as a borderland through gates and regulations. As students, we should perpetually be thinking about the language, rhetoric and actions we take in relation to the community around us. We must not forget that our pretty and lush campus — along with all the resources that come alongside it — is a privilege created at the expense of communities who were here long before us. Let’s remember who the real intruders are: us.

With an impressive 71-33-6 all-time record, USC will be looking to once again continue the tradition of beating the University of California, Berkeley at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday night. In their previous matchup, the Trojans lost 24-14 at Berkeley, marking just the fourth time they’ve lost since 2000. Riding a road win against Arizona, the 7-1 Trojans will look to make quick work of the 3-5 Bears. 
Still, there are many storylines that have yet to play out and key players who will be exciting to watch on Saturday, making this week’s matchup one to keep an eye on, despite the Trojans being 21-point favorites. 
Caleb Williams
With college football media’s attention fixed on the Southeastern Conference and the Big 10 — two conferences driven by powerhouse schools like Georgia, Ohio State and Tennessee — it is often easy to forget that USC’s own star quarterback is on track for a historically great year, and is currently ranked third in Heisman trophy odds. On the season, Williams has been an explosive passer while also demonstrating the ability to protect the football, as he currently holds the best touchdown to interception ratio in college football at 24-1. Coming off of back-to-back performances of five touchdowns, zero interceptions and 380+ passing yards, don’t be surprised if Williams puts up more Madden-like numbers against Cal’s questionable defense, one that has struggled against the likes of Colorado, a team that is ranked 119th in the country. Cal State has also failed to defeat a Pac-12 team this season.
Wide Receiving Corps
Despite the devastating losses of junior Jordan Addison and sophomore Mario Williams to USC’s wide receiving corps against Arizona, the team demonstrated their resilience and depth at wide receiver, with redshirt junior Tahj Washington leading the way with 118 yards and 2 touchdowns. Wide receivers redshirt junior Kyle Ford and junior Brenden Rice also stepped up, each contributing a touchdown of their own and a combined 176 yards. When Addison and Williams return, the offense should be nearly impossible to contain. With USC ranked 3rd in the nation in offensive drive efficiency and 8th in points per game, the team will look to rely on its excellent wide receiver depth to move the ball downfield.
The Defense
They say that defense wins championships, and if the Trojans want to compete for a Pac-12 or (with a little luck) a national title, they must tighten up the run defense. This is not to say that USC has not been competent on the defensive side, as they are still leading the nation in turnover margin at +16, but their struggles have been evident. A promising effort in Arizona saw three takeaways, but the run defense could still be improved, as they stand at eighth in the Pac-12 in rushing yards allowed per game at 152.7 yards per game. That being said, key defensive players sophomore inside linebacker Eric Gentry, senior inside linebacker Shane Lee and redshirt junior defensive back Max Williams, will need to perform to limit Cal’s rushing attack. Also, make note of sack leaders junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu and redshirt senior defensive lineman Nick Figueroa, who will look to wreak havoc on Cal’s offensive line. Additionally, USC will have to prepare to stop any big run plays from Cal’s leading rusher, freshman running back Jaydn Ott. While the Trojans are excellent when playing from ahead, if they fall down early, a strong Cal run game could spell their demise. 
Lincoln Riley
Since coming to USC, Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s offensive scheme has been both simple and elegant, allowing for Williams and the weapons to thrive while also making use of the team’s well rounded offensive line and reliable run game. USC’s air raid offense has been the most exciting aspect to watch this season, so it will be worth paying attention to how Riley will scheme the offense against Cal’s weak secondary, which has allowed nearly 300 yards of passing per game. Expect to see a lot of shotgun formations and short and intermediate passes. Whatever Riley’s offensive mind can cook up, Williams’s football knowledge will compliment as his audibling this year has looked mature and ahead of his years.

In a bizarre sequence of events, the Exposition Park area will witness two sporting events with varying degrees of importance, depending on who you are asking. This Saturday, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will be home to the Pac-12 football match between USC and the University of California, Berkeley, just a few hours after the adjacent Banc of California Stadium hosts the Major League Soccer Cup Final bout between Los Angeles Football Club and Philadelphia Union. 
Both matches provide crucial implications for respective fanbases — the Trojans seek a second consecutive victory upon their return to the Coliseum, and LAFC hopes to earn their first-ever MLS Cup. 
The unprecedented combination of adjacent sporting events will unequivocally introduce traffic complications near Exposition Park. Senior Vice President of Administration David Wright issued a news release Wednesday and alerted students, faculty and staff regarding the anticipated increased traffic. Wright expects that LAFC fans will “impact” the Exposition Park area from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., approximately two hours before the Trojans’ bout against the Golden Bears.
 LAFC encourages fans to avoid parking and use other forms of transportation to attend the game, even going so far as to provide free shuttles from Dodger Stadium. Additionally, LAFC will open their stadium gates at 10:30 a.m., approximately two and a half hours before kick-off, to encourage fans to arrive at the stadium and area earlier. LAFC has formally partnered and collaborated with the LA Metro, as the transit system encourages fans to use a series of buses or subways to attend the MLS Cup final. 
“In one of the greatest sports cities in the world, it’s not surprising that we find ourselves in a unique and challenging situation with same-day events in Expo Park,” said LAFC co-president Larry Freedman in an interview with the L.A. Times. 
Although the two teams interact with different types of footballs, LAFC and the Trojans have experienced identically exceptional seasons in their respective leagues. Lincoln Riley’s camp currently boasts a 7-1 record, experiencing their first-season loss against Utah last Saturday. LAFC finished the 2022 MLS season as the first seed in the Western Conference and eliminated cross-town rivals Los Angeles Galaxy in the Conference Semifinals en route to their first-ever MLS Cup Final appearance. 
LAFC continues its marauding run since its relatively recent inception in 2018, as the MLS outfit won the Supporters Shield in 2019 and hopes to find their crowning achievement on Saturday just four years after entering the league. 
Interestingly, the MLS Cup’s venue designation arises from LAFC’s strong regular season. Unlike other professional soccer leagues, Major League Soccer holds its domestic tournament final in the home stadium of the finalist with the most regular season points. Although both finalists, LAFC and Philadelphia Union, found themselves tied with 67 points apiece, LAFC’s 21 regular season victories overshadow Philadelphia’s 19, thus providing L.A. the home advantage in the final along with the Supporters’ Shield. 
Previously, LAFC and USC Football avoided same-day encounters with a comfortable schedule: the Trojans would generally play football matches on Saturdays, whereas the MLS outfit would host bouts at the Banc of California on Sundays. 
LAFC and USC Football will unite in the Exposition Park area this Saturday, only a few hours apart, for different motivations. LAFC seeks their first MLS cup in franchise history, and the Trojans expect a victory on their return home to the Coliseum. Although traffic and condensed commotion might cause complications, the neighborhood may witness successive glory in a matter of hours. The MLS Cup Final’s kick-off is between LAFC and Philadelphia Union at 1 p.m. and the football match between USC and Berkeley will start only a few yards away at 7:30 p.m.

November is here and the biggest showcase of football could not come sooner. It’s like waiting for Christmas morning to open your presents.  Fox Sports — one of the broadcast rights holders for the tournament — even ran their World Cup campaign under that theme.
Looking at this commercial — one that depicts American actor Jon Hamm as Santa Claus, putting together the best Christmas celebration for the World Cup — I reminisce about the enjoyable moments of the World Cup in my childhood. Don’t get me wrong, I still greatly enjoy the World Cup, but sometimes it just feels like you grow out of things. 
Like with Christmas, at some point in time we lose our awe towards these once sacred holidays. Still, we continue to measure our lives based on the number of World Cups we have seen. 
At 20 years old, I have lived through five World Cup cycles and I’m stoked to witness yet another one this winter. Growing up, my mom would tell me stories of how she experienced the World Cup as a kid. 
“There was the fever of the World Cup book of all the players and teams, and we all wanted to get the little stickers,” my mother said, remembering how she would send her brother, to la plaza to play for more stamps. 
“We used to meet a lot of children in the square in front of the parish to play volados to exchange or to win the stamps,” my uncle said, who remembers playing by merit of a coin toss for his favorite players. 
While the 2002 Japan/Korea World Cup was technically the first one I lived through, I don’t remember much about it since I was only a few months old. The only thing I remember about the 2006 edition of the tournament in Germany is getting a México national team uniform for Christmas that year. It had the logo of the tournament with three happy faces and the symbol of the trophy. Certainly, the logo encapsulates the motto of that year’s tournament: “time to make friends.”
South Africa 2010 was my most memorable World Cup. I remember Diego Forlan of Uruguay and his formidable skill with the Jabulani. I recall yelling after Javier “El Chicharito” Hernadez’s goal against France, only to later hear how special it was for him that his first World Cup goal was against the same country that his grandfather scored his first goal against when he competed in the World Cup. That same year I also remember the theme song — Shakira’s “Waka Waka” — and Luis Suarez’s temporary moment of craziness when he blocked a goal attempt and was sent off against Ghana. The final was memorable too. Airing late in the afternoon, I remember staying up until almost 11 p.m. watching the match and later Spain’s celebration, walking up the steps of the stadium to receive the trophy from then FIFA president, Sepp Blatter.  
How could I forget one of Mexico’s saddest moments in the World Cup; losing 2-1 against the Netherlands in Brazil 2014. With this came the birth of #Noerapenal and a lifelong denial period for Mexican soccer fans. In that same tournament, we witnessed Lionel Messi’s closest run to winning a World Cup; falling short against Germany in the final. 
From bitter moments in Brazil to joyful excitement in Russia, Mexican fans felt some sort of vindication when Hirving Lozano scored an only goal against the current champion — Germany. For a México fan, the desire to make it to the fifth game of the tournament keeps us hopeful. My uncle remembers the Mexico vs. Bulgaria match of 1994 as a time when we almost consolidated that hope.
 “Unfortunately, in the round of 16 against Bulgaria in a penalty shootout, we were once again just a step away from the next stage,” he said.
In that regard, I would like to never lose the excitement of the World Cup. Now my uncle says he lives the excitement through another lens. 
“Now with my children, it is reliving that stage of the World Cup with the collection of stamps,” he said. ”Completing an album, which reminds me of those times to check with the players and the stamps and now to complete it with my children.”
At the end of the day, it is a competition, but it’s also entertainment. Enjoy every second of it as if it was your first World Cup. Keep up the excitement of a little kid waking up on Christmas morning.

After two straight road games and a bye week, USC Football makes its return to the Coliseum for a matchup against Cal Saturday. The game is also during USC’s Homecoming weekend, when alumni are welcomed back to campus.
The Trojans enter Saturday’s contest with a 7-1 record, with their most recent win coming on the road against Arizona. The USC offense played arguably their best game of the season, gathering 621 yards of total offense. Although the Trojans were without junior wide receiver Jordan Addison and sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams, redshirt juniors Tahj Washington and Kyle Ford were there to make up for the loss.
Washington had seven receptions for 118 yards and two touchdowns, and Ford had six receptions for 114 yards and a touchdown. Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams had a career high 411 passing yards and five touchdowns, and redshirt senior running back Travis Dye added 113 yards on the ground and a rushing touchdown.
Head Coach Lincoln Riley said all the players who did not play on Saturday were dealing with injury, but hopes to get everyone back healthy as soon as possible.
“My gut feel is we’ll probably end up getting a few of them back, but maybe not all,” Riley said. “I don’t know if I’d definitively say anyone’s for sure in and certainly won’t say if anyone’s for sure out right now.”
Riley did say everyone was able to participate in Tuesday’s morning practice and is hopeful to play on Saturday.
“We’re doing better and everybody participated but not in a full manner,” Riley said. “We have a lot of guys making a lot of progress and a lot of guys that will be close for the game.”
The Trojans enter Saturday’s game fourth in the Pac-12 in yards per game with 493.5, and are second in the conference in scoring, averaging 41 points per game. USC will face a Cal defense that is giving up 416.8 yards per game and 25 points per game this season. There is potential for Saturday to be a pass heavy game for USC, as Cal is also giving up the most passing yards per game in the Pac-12 with 292.3 passing yards per game allowed.
On the other side, the USC defense is coming off back to back games of allowing over 500 yards of total offense, and will look to get back on track against a Cal offense averaging 374.5 yards and 23.4 points per game this season, good for 10th in the Pac-12.
Junior defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu addressed the recent struggles for USC’s defense, saying they are not far off from where they want to be.
“I think our effort is there,” Tuipulotu said. “Sometimes you want to go so hard, but sometimes you do too much. I think we just have to execute, do our jobs and we’ll be straight.”
Tuipulotu also talked about not getting complacent on the defensive side of the ball and how it could be a factor in some of the struggles recently.
“I wouldn’t say we let up, but it looked like we let up,” Tuipulotu said. “We just have to keep applying pressure and keep going.”
USC’s defensive mishaps over the last two games can also be attributed to sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry’s absence.
The Trojans will hope to get Gentry, who missed last Saturday’s game with an ankle injury, back on the field against Cal. A transfer from Arizona State, Gentry leads the Trojans in tackles with 52 and also has one sack, one forced fumble and two pass break ups on the season so far.
The USC defense is facing a Cal offense led by senior quarterback Jack Plummer, who has 1,968 yards and 13 touchdowns this season. Out of the backfield, freshman running back Jaydn Ott is leading the Golden Bears in rushing with 675 yards and five rushing touchdowns. Junior wide receiver Jeremiah Hunter is leading Cal in receiving yards with 544 yards, and freshman wide receiver J. Michael Sturdivant is second on the team in receiving yards with 516 yards, and first in touchdown catches with six.
The Trojans have a 70-32-4 all time record against Cal and in matchups at the Coliseum, USC is 36-16-3 all time. The most recent matchup between the two teams was on Dec. 4 last season, in which the Trojans lost 24-14.
Saturday’s game against Cal will kickoff at 7:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
