Robert Sanders — or Hong Kong Boyfriend, as you might know him — is comfortable floating around in feelings of nostalgia and past loves, and he has no problem sharing that with the world.
Sanders, a senior majoring in popular music performance, just released his debut single, “Cold Waters” Aug. 26.
Originally from the Bay Area, Sanders has been playing music since he was a kid. He started with the violin when he was young, but eventually quit to pursue singing and pop music performance. 
“I feel like there’s more things that can be expressed with pop music than classical music, personally,” Sanders said. “[There were] more things that I wanted to say that I couldn’t say through violin and stuff.” 
Drawing inspiration from musicians such as Bon Iver, Frank Ocean and Travis Scott, Sanders doesn’t feel bound to any one genre or style of songwriting. He even listens to hyper pop (“it’s like TikTok music, basically,” he said) and underground rap/hip-hop on SoundCloud. For Sanders, music is more than a genre — it’s something he can create to understand himself, without relying on outside influences. 
“Music is an outlet for me to express a side of myself that I had to discover on my own,” Sanders said. “No one ever told me I should or could do pop music, so it’s been a way to find myself.” 
All the support and encouragement Sanders received from his parents when he was younger slowly turned into hesitation and reluctance when it became clear that music and songwriting were his true passions. Though she’s come around now, Sanders’ mom took a while to support music as a career choice. 
“My mom didn’t believe in me until I got into [the Thornton School of Music], saw how small the program was and how amazing of an opportunity it could be for me,” Sanders said. “I feel like until I had the support of a big organization, my mom didn’t really believe in me.” 
Through this process of exploring different sides of himself and figuring out who he is, Sanders has been able to pull from nostalgic experiences to write his songs. Sanders said that by reminiscing on past events and memories, he’s able to reflect in a way that leads him to genuinely understanding the things that happened in his life and why they did as well. Because of this, he said he thinks of his songs as pieces of advice that he can pass out to other young people, so they, too, can understand their life experiences a bit better. 
“A big reason I write music is to give advice to a younger version of myself,” Sanders said. “I’ve learned a lot just through life, and I feel like passing on some of the ideas and stuff would be good for the world because a lot of people have no idea what they’re doing when they’re growing up, so just trying to help out.” 
Sean Lewow, who manages Hong Kong Boyfriend and runs the artist management division of the creative studio and artist management company Ourros, proclaims that Sanders is a “visionary.”
“Everything that Rob puts out under the ‘Hong Kong Boyfriend’ name — it can be stood behind,” Lewow said. “It’s something that he’s prodded upon and thought about both visually as well as sonically for years. He very much knows what he wants to say and is far more creative than almost anyone I’ve met.”
With “Cold Waters,” Sanders recalls a time in his life where he was in love with an older girl, so much so that he lost himself a little bit. Upon the song’s release, he wrote in an Instagram post, “When I was young, I met a girl who played cello and talked a lot more than me. I had a flip phone and a single-speed bike. Maybe it was love, maybe we just needed each other. ‘Cold Waters’ is a song about spiraling.”
The music video, which was directed by Aamir Khuller and is Sanders’ first-ever video, works to expand the meaning of “Cold Waters.” It features different relationship dynamics — a clear inspiration throughout Sanders’ work — including that of a couple, going through good and bad times. 
Khuller, a senior majoring in media arts and practice, directed the “Cold Waters” video with Frank Ocean’s “Nikes” in mind, calling it the “holy grail of music videos” to him and Sanders.
“I was inspired by wanting to make a collage of the ‘Nikes’ video,” Khuller said. “I love how many different textures and feelings and different pieces of a story there are to hold on to in that video and how they’re all collaged together. It just started from there — just wanting to tell a story.”
For Sanders, the video was a way to explore the universality of this romantic experience, rather than focusing on how he was special in the things he had gone through. 
“As soon as you bring in actors to represent your ideas, you realize that how you felt was not really important,” Sanders said. “Now, it’s up to someone else to relay that emotion. It’s humbling.” 
The “Cold Waters” video also almost exclusively features Asian Americans, which was important to Sanders, who is half Chinese. 
“Representation matters to me because, as [a person] of color, if you’re in a spot where [other] people are going to see you doing something cool, you have to make yourself known,” Sanders said. “You probably didn’t have that when you were a kid, and someone else needs that out there.” 
Khuller, who is Indian American, had similar goals regarding representation in the music video.
“What we wanted to do with ‘Cold Waters’ … was allow [Asian Americans] to carry out a storyline and not be tokenized,” Khuller said. “They’re people that have real storylines and emotions. They go through an arc, and hopefully you just see them as real people that happen to be Asian American.”
Sanders said he aims to be true to himself with his music and artistry and release more music.
“It’s not about looking perfect in every scene, it’s about being who you are and letting that resonate with people,” Sanders said. 
Hong Kong Boyfriend’s songs “Cold Waters” and “Tiramisu” are available on Spotify and the corresponding music videos are available on YouTube. His EP is projected to drop sometime in 2021.

Depending on which side of TikTok you’re on, your “For You” page may be filled with white teens dancing in their mansions, people acting out mafia POVs or the surreal, distorted videos that populate Deep TikTok. But while you’re scrolling through your preferred content with your Zoom lecture playing in the background, you may also come across videos documenting the lives of college students across the country as they adjust to their new campus environments amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Many students have recorded themselves moving into their dorms, only to be moved back out with some real speed. This was the experience shared by students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which resulted in a whole slew of TikToks transitioning from decorated dorms to bare ones (instead of the classic other way around) after UNC was forced to revert to remote learning only a week into classes. Another viral trend spawned at New York University, where students showed off their less-than-satisfactory quarantine meals, which often ignored dietary restrictions that they had. 
Others have taken to TikTok to expose fellow students who are not following social distancing guidelines set by the state or their schools. Parties and other large gatherings have been put on blast by students who do not want to get sent home because of the irresponsible actions of a few. Some students have come under fire for filming their own parties — and they even have the audacity to become angry or defensive when their comment sections are filled with comments such as, “I guess COVID is over,” with the typical clown emoji for added sarcastic flare. 
While on a different platform, the Daily Trojan’s Instagram post showing students partying in off-campus housing was met with mixed reactions. Some condemned the partiers and others the publication, calling it “creepy,” “spying” and the “Daily Hall Monitor.” 
It shouldn’t fall completely on students to regulate the behavior of their peers. In an op-ed for The New York Times, Cornell University assistant professor Karen Levy argued that peer surveillance shifts the blame of a potential outbreak from administrators, who were the ones who decided to open school in the first place, onto students who didn’t report instances of rule-breaking.
Yes, colleges shouldn’t have reopened in the first place, given that it was practically inevitable that some students would party if given the opportunity. That being said, the reality is that they have, and while some have cracked down by dishing out suspensions and even expulsions to students who fail to comply with safety measures, where colleges themselves have failed to strictly enforce rules, it may be up to students to hold their peers accountable.
Among the college students and social media influencers to be criticized for breaking social distancing rules was TikTok star Jessica Zhang — a freshman at Levy’s own Cornell University — who hopped on Snapchat during a party to say, “The people who slide up saying ‘you’re not social distancing’ are the ones that wouldn’t have been invited anyway.” 
Cool kid alert, but it’s not edgy to disregard safety measures. If Zhang had contracted the virus, she may have been able to return home in relative peace. For some students, however, not being able to remain on campus has severe negative impacts on their ability to excel in school. Wi-Fi, technology devices and quiet spaces for attending classes and studying are among things that some students would not have access to if they were not on campus. Student partying also jeopardizes surrounding residential communities, for whom the city is their permanent home, not a temporary dorm. 
Levy also wrote that having students report their own peers threatens social dynamics between students because it causes them to have to weigh being “branded with the stigma of being a ‘narc’” against “playing a role in preserving public health.” While this is an important consideration, the more important one might be that reporting parties to campus or city police may disproportionately affect students of color who might be involved. It will likely be difficult for students to decide whether or not to report safety and health concerns to institutions that have frankly been doing the opposite of keeping people safe.
This is not a clear-cut issue. For reasons stated above, it is necessary to exercise care in reporting students. It may become even more blurry when social media is involved. The internet can be a scary place; coronavirus partiers may get bashed beyond their imagining on social media, even if they had attended without much consideration. This article does not condone bullying on the internet because it can have lasting consequences as grave as the virus itself. No one should become a social pariah, be pushed to hurt themselves or have the rest of their lives ruined for attending a party even during the pandemic if — like many college students — they just haven’t thought too deeply about it. 
However, the time for light consideration has certainly passed. It is not at all new information that partying is endangering others. Gathering in large numbers without proper precautions has been discouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the government (although perhaps not strongly enough), schools and individuals for over six months. 
So, before you party, consider the fact that you could be exposing yourself and others to the virus. Before you party, consider that someone who was not even there could die because of your reckless actions and impulsive decisions. Before you party, consider that students will have their phones on them and that your face could end up on TikTok, branded with the single personality trait “COVID partier” — and that you will not be given the luxury to defend yourself. 
And, given all these considerations, if you still party unapologetically, exposers deserve exposure. Wear a face mask or face the masses. Remember, these are people’s lives being put at risk.

Faculty and staff members can reach out to the Center for Work and Family Life at (213) 821-0800.

Over the past year since my friend died by suicide, I’ve found immense catharsis in learning more about suicidality, depression and the environmental and social factors that influence our mental health. While there may not be a definitive answer to explain why a person suicides or how we can prevent it, it is nonetheless important to critically examine the harmful social and cultural climates that permeate the environments of young people. 
An increasing number of scholars and researchers have begun to look through suicidality through the framework of gender roles, especially behaviors and attitudes associated with toxic masculinity. 
Toxic masculinity, the frequently used catch-all term employed to talk about issues such as rape culture and locker-room banter, is less often applied to our conversations about mental health. Informing broad assumptions around male emotionality, toxic masculinity underpins a system where vulnerability is seen as a sign of weakness rather than strength, and asking for help is insidiously stigmatized. 
While mental health issues are of equal concern for all genders, the prevalence of recorded mental illness is greater for women, suggesting that men may be less likely to seek treatment to identify the problem in the first place. Among those actually diagnosed with mental illness, men are less likely than women to seek help, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. 
The NIMH also indicates that men are less likely than women to recognize, discuss or seek treatment for symptoms of depression, despite approximately 30% of men reportedly suffering from a period of depression in their lifetime.
Toxic masculinity may also play a role in the increased prevalence of men engaging in dangerous behaviors like binge-drinking and reckless driving. According to a report from the Pan American Health Organization, the life expectancy for men in the Americas is 5.8 years below that of women, partly due to the societal expectations imposed on men to engage in risk-seeking behaviors. 
A desire to project stereotypically masculine traits like toughness or virility may explain the statistics around physical injury and substance usage. Men are three times more likely than women to die from injuries and are less likely than women to seek medical care and follow medical instruction. 
They are also more likely than women to suffer from substance abuse, despite both women and men facing an equal proclivity to substance use disorders. Based on a research report from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, men are more likely to have emergency room visits or die from overdose-related deaths than women and have higher rates of use or dependence on illicit drugs and alcohol than women. 
The increased preference for engaging in risky behaviors, paired with a decreased rate of seeking help, may be applied to better understand the statistics around male suicidality. 
According to the NIMH, women are more likely to attempt suicide then men, but men are more likely to die by suicide. This is due in part to the fact that men are more likely to use lethal methods, such as firearms, as men represented 86% of firearm suicide victims in the U.S. from 2012 to 2016. Toxic masculinity well informs the very behaviors and methods employed by men to take their own lives, choosing that which may be perceived as most aggressive, leading to methods that are most deadly and irreversible. 
Ultimately, a failure to openly discuss the consequences of oppressive gender roles severely impairs our ability to improve conversations about suicide prevention and avoidable causes of death due to substance use. Hesitating to engage in these uncomfortable conversations serves to perpetuate a public health crisis and detriment to our community.
It is a reminder particularly relevant on a college campus that faced nine deaths throughout the  Fall 2019 semester, where three have been confirmed as suicides, four as drug overdoses, one as a fatal car accident — and all seven of these individuals were identified as male. 
While the fight to combat gender roles has largely been shaped by the work of feminist activists seeking equal rights for women, what must not be lost in the conversation is that the abolition of gender roles is an advancement for all. Gender roles harmfully enforce rigid expectations, stereotypes and normative assumptions about the roles both men and women ought to play. This in turn prevents all from adequate and necessary emotional expression, and conclusively debilitates overall wellbeing and health.

Grouped together by an innovative Viterbi course, five students started Torch Global, Inc., a non-profit that provides refugees and people experiencing homelessness more viable shelter conditions. 
Over the course of the 2019-20 school year, they engineered Torch Tiles: pieces of Aluminet that regulate temperature in order to make tent habitats breathable and resistant to environmental conditions. The innovation of its founders Ayeshna Desai, Gianna Morena, Laura Roed, Lauren Yen and Jacob Totaro won the Iovine and Young Academy Social Impact Prize of $10,000 this past summer.
The five seniors were placed in a group after applying to be in the course “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Crisis,” previously called “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Challenges,” at the Viterbi School for Engineering. The course is intended to teach students innovation in the midst of a crisis, with last year’s class focusing on helping refugees. The instructors, Burcin Becerik-Gerber, David Jason Gerber, School of Cinematic Arts alumnus Daniel Druhora and Viterbi alumnus Brad Cracchiola, contribute a range of backgrounds and skill sets to create an interdisciplinary curriculum open to all majors.
“Our mission with the course is to raise a new generation of changemakers who know how to effectively use engineering, design, research and storytelling to innovate in times of crisis and bring solutions that affect people’s lives,” Druhora said. “The motto of the course is ‘lives, not grades.’”
The course spans the entire school year, and the class took two research trips to Mória Refugee Camp, the largest refugee camp in Europe, on the island of Lesbos in Greece. The purpose of the first trip in the fall was to analyze the needs of refugees and then return in the spring to test their product and collect feedback. 
On their fall trip, the founders said they realized the overwhelming need for resources to keep refugees warm during the winter and cool during the hotter months. People experiencing homelessness might rely on tents as their homes for months, if not years at a time, until they are able to find a permanent home. Torch’s goal was to find a low-cost, effective way to improve their living conditions.
Co-founder and now CEO Jacob Totaro, a senior majoring in environmental engineering and engineering management, emphasized the importance of their trip for assessing the immediate needs of refugees and collecting firsthand data. After returning from Greece, the team identified that they wanted to tackle the problem of warmth in tents.
“We wanted to come up with a cheap and effective way to improve living conditions for a lot of people at a relatively low cost, so we thought about the idea of warming the tent as a home, and that’s kind of what our first prototype came out of,” Totaro said.
The team initially tried taping together pieces of mylar emergency blankets as their first prototype. They then slept inside and recorded measurements but realized that the material trapped too much heat. After researching many materials, they ultimately settled on Aluminet, a shade cloth which is used for industrial scale greenhouses. 
“When you think about a greenhouse, the goal is to keep what’s inside warm in the winter time, but also in the summertime that shades it from getting too hot and getting too much exposure from the sun,” Totaro said. “We took that idea and applied it to people living in tents and makeshift structures as a really affordable way to take this material that’s being used in like, hundred square-foot yards at a time to just break it down, cut it up and basically give people these little tent covers that would regulate temperature.”
The Aluminet material is an aluminum-coated mesh that works to reflect body heat when placed inside the tent but also allows for breathability to eliminate the formation of condensation and keep the tent dry inside. Through their testing, the team found that placing the Tile inside the tent increases the temperature by 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit, close to the temperature that most people set their thermostat to in colder months. 
“They felt that it really made a difference and it was a matter of them being able to sleep with like one less blanket at night because it kept them really warm,” said Morena, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and co-founder of Torch. “And now we’ve realized it can also help in the summer, like dispersing it here like on Skid Row to help with the L.A. heat wave.”  
On their second trip to Mória, they tested the product with five different refugee families, who all said that it worked to increase temperature in the winter and helped significantly with humidity. Normally waking up to pools of sweat on the floor, Torch’s knitted blanket made of reflective material allowed the moisture to escape from the tent.
Co-founder Laura Roed, a senior in IYA, said that the team saw the same need among refugees they met in Greece and in people experiencing homelessness in L.A..
“Instead of starting in the refugee camps, we decided to actually start in Skid Row because we realized there were a ton of parallels between refugee camps and the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles,” Roed said. “By starting here, we would actually be able to talk to people ourselves and get feedback from people.”
Coming out of the class with the product developed, the group started their nonprofit and applied for 501(c)(3) status. Using the prize money from the IYA competition and money raised from GoFundMe fundraisers, they ordered and distributed 500 Tiles in the summer to communities experiencing homelessness in Downtown L.A. with the help of partner organizations such as The People Concern and Water Drop LA. 
Avery Dukes, volunteer coordinator for Water Drop LA, works closely with the Torch team. Water Drop LA, another organization started by USC students, makes weekly water drops on Skid Row and has also distributed Torch Tiles to people experiencing homelessness.
“[One man on Skid Row] stepped inside and was like, ‘There’s a huge difference already.’ He said usually he’ll step in his tent and hit a wall of heat, and that just didn’t happen that time,” Dukes said. “Driving around on Skid [Row] we’ll see a whole streak where almost everyone has a Tile or one person with a big tent will have two or three to cover the whole thing. We’ve had people rush over to ask us if we have a Tile so they can be the first one to have dibs.”
Sarah Higgins is a Program Director for E6 Outreach at The People Concern, which is an L.A.-based service provider for people experiencing homelessness. Torch partnered with The People Concern to determine the effectiveness of the product for people experiencing homelessness in L.A. They distributed 50 Tiles and collected feedback through surveys.
“It was weird timing because we got the [Tiles] right around the time that there was this real COVID surge in our population, and that there was the heat wave that was happening so clients were having a really hard time self-isolating,” Higgins said. “Our response from the clients was that, you know, nothing is perfect, but that [the Tiles] definitely made it much more comfortable and easier to breathe inside of their tent.”
The team just finished another fundraising campaign, raising about $13,000 and placed another order for 1500 Tiles. They plan to allocate several hundred to refugee communities in Mexico and homeless outreach organizations in San Francisco, and distribute the remaining 1000 across L.A. 
Depending on the size of the Tiles and the order placed, each tile ranges from roughly $10-12 in cost. Torch is able to keep the cost low by using a manufacturer in China, and either distributes the Tiles themselves or acts as a middleman between the manufacturer and aid providers who are already distributing. Long-term, Totaro said they plan to make their system scalable and easy to maintain by primarily placing orders for distributors. 
Two interns, Ethan Cruz and Michael Nazari, have joined the team this fall. Cruz, a UCLA senior studying history and business entrepreneurship, works closely with Roed as a business development intern to help Torch grow as a nonprofit organization and develop a business model. Nazari, a USC junior majoring in civil engineering with an environmental emphasis, was brought on as product development intern to improve the Tile product.
“The current plan is to progress and grow our brand as a nonprofit org right now, and try to garner as much of a reputation that way and in that market,” Cruz said. “But as we grow as a company, we want to also have different channels of revenue to grasp on and help our nonprofit side.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the former name of the course “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Crisis” that was titled “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Challenges.” The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When Jaryn Valdry heard that a chapter of The Women’s Network was launching at USC and was accepting applications for its first executive board members, she didn’t think she was qualified enough to apply for the president position. But after speaking with Jamie Vinick, who founded the first chapter of the organization at Syracuse University in 2017, Valdry understood the true mission behind the organization — championing ambition and empowering women to break through their preconceived limitations. 
She applied for president and got the position. 
In just three years, TWN has expanded to 23 campuses nationwide and is continuing to grow. Vinick’s interest in adding a chapter at USC began after she started a beta chapter at UC Berkeley. The USC Chapter of TWN was expected to launch in Spring 2020, but because students were sent home early amid the coronavirus pandemic, the official launch moved to this fall. 
Valdry, a junior majoring in communication, worked with her 10-member e-board throughout the summer to lay the groundwork for the organization and plan virtual events for its launch. Her team hopped on social media to get the word out about the organization and direct-messaged USC women and women’s organizations on campus to gauge interest, but still she said they had no idea whether or not it would be successful in a virtual environment.
“Over the summer, it’s different because you’re seeing all of this from the outside,” Valdry said. “But when you actually start doing meetings, you’re like ‘Are people going to show up? Are people going to be excited?’” 
From their expansive messaging to students, more than 100 people attended TWN’s first meeting and more than 1,000 people joined the mailing list. 
Valdry said that TWN puts on various events that help women redefine ambition and target specific aspects of networking, such as resume revisions and LinkedIn workshops, networking trips and alumni receptions. One event the organization hopes to hold once in-person operations resume, “Mocktails,” encourages members to interact with one another and develop soft skills, such as making eye contact, shaking hands and sending follow-up emails. 
“[The events are] focused on championing ambition, which is something that, a lot of times, in the workforce, is seen as a negative factor of women,” Valdry said. “A lot of people believe that women who are ambitious are tryhards or overly passionate and really, it’s our way of reclaiming that word and using it as a fire for our confidence … using that as a way to bring our own views to the table and feel confident in that and have that kind of self recognition of ‘I am a confident woman who deserves to have a seat at the table, even if it’s a table full of men.’” 
TWN also invites high-profile female leaders across different industries to speak about their careers and offer advice, such as Christine Broda, former consumer insights manager at Spotify, and Rebecca Jarvis, chief business, technology and economics correspondent at ABC News.  
“It’ll be kind of like an informational interview, but with a live audience,” Valdry said. “It’s all about building those networking skills and feeling confident in those. If you’re able to start in a comfortable network, you’ll be able to do it outside of the network as well.”
Despite the success of TWN’s virtual launch, the e-board and members are looking forward to in-person events and bonding. 
“In the future, it’ll be even better to be able to be in an environment where you get to go to companies like Hulu and BuzzFeed and really feel what the environment is like working in that space,” Valdry said. 
Bella Teta, a sophomore majoring in public relations, is the marketing coordinator for TWN. She said that aside from the events, she enjoys getting to know the other members of TWN.
“I feel like one of the great things about The Women’s Network is that we attract people across all majors in all disciplines,” Teta said. “Everyone is extremely open minded. Everyone is honestly so nice too, which I love. These are all people who I can definitely see going out into the professional world. They’re going to do some big things.”
Lyme Cho, a freshman majoring in journalism, joined TWN as a new member earlier this month after coming across the organization’s Instagram page. Attending her first-semester classes from South Korea, Cho said the timezone difference paired with virtual learning has made it difficult for her to meet her peers. She is looking forward to creating connections within TWN.
“Especially during these times, we don’t have any opportunities to meet in person,” Cho said. “We’re doing this solely through the internet, through networking. It’s another example of how powerful networking can be, and being a woman and being able to prove that through this, is really inspiring.”
In addition to accepting members from all majors, TWN does not require any dues or prior professional experience. Valdry said she searched for a women’s organization at USC for a long time prior to TWN but was often restricted due to the application processes, the experience requirements and the time commitment. 
“For me, the draw was that there’s no application, there’s no dues for undergraduate members,” Valdry said. “And I wanted to be able to influence others to be able to be as confident in themselves as I have been able to be throughout my life. And that’s only then because I have strong women in my life.”

After coming up short with high hopes in the last few seasons, the Los Angeles Dodgers must finally capture the elusive World Series trophy. It’s been a long 32 years since they’ve brought L.A. a championship.
The Dodgers are one of Major League Baseball’s premiere franchises, and they’ve dominated the National League in recent years. They have claimed the National League West pennant for eight consecutive seasons now, giving fans a lot of hope, but the team struggles to get over the postseason hump.
The 2017 World Series ended with a heartbreaking and highly controversial loss to the Astros as it was revealed that Houston was cheating. The Dodgers failed to deliver on baseball’s biggest stage again in 2018, going down without much of a fight in five games to the Boston Red Sox.
L.A. came back in 2019 with high hopes once again. Although they lost shortstop Manny Machado and right fielder Yasiel Puig, neither was particularly special in their 2018 playoff run. To make up for it, they got a breakout MVP season from first baseman and outfielder Cody Bellinger. 
Bellinger and the Dodgers finished with a National League-best 106 wins and were again expected to make a deep playoff run at the very least. Angelenos wanted nothing less than a title. 
Unfortunately, a brilliant underdog run from the Washington Nationals with a Howie Kendrick grand slam cut the Dodgers’ postseason short in the National League Division Series. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw’s one bad start and relief appearance that featured more home runs than outs was partially to blame for the additional disastrous playoff series. 
Bellinger and shortstop Corey Seager underperformed with only two extra base hits between them, and the team as a whole was average at best, combining to hit just .220 with 9 home runs over five games. Analytics junkies don’t value batting average much anymore, but I still find it useful in certain cases — .220 is not good no matter how you slice it.  
After learning of Houston’s sign-stealing antics that helped rob L.A. of a ring, the Dodgers geared up for the 2020 season with a chip on their shoulders. Even after losing starting pitchers Hyun-Jin Ryu and Rich Hill, they were still heavily favored in sports books to win the division. Then they traded for 2018 American League MVP Mookie Betts. 
And just how good are the Dodgers this year? They won 43 of their 60 games. This pace would have resulted in 116 wins in a regular season — a number only achieved twice in MLB history.
The Dodgers have had their fair share of injuries and used a countless number of different lineups. Most teams like to have a consistent lineup and to play with the same eight guys in the field as much as possible, hoping to establish a rhythm and chemistry. 
Perhaps the Dodgers’ greatest strength is their depth and versatility. Chris Taylor can play basically anywhere, and Enrique Hernandez has made appearances at five different positions this season. Max Muncy can play all around the infield, which gives them options: Justin Turner can be moved to the designated hitter spot, and Bellinger can be moved to first base. Even Betts made an appearance at second base. 
This will give the Dodgers a lot of flexibility for mid-game adjustments in the playoffs. Hernandez is a valuable defender, but he can’t seem to hit. Maybe he starts a game at second base and gets subbed out in the sixth or seventh inning. L.A. will have several guys ready to step in that can play multiple positions.
This is important because the Dodgers won’t have the normal advantages that baseball’s best team enjoys in the postseason. Homefield advantage isn’t really a factor this year, but past that, they will play the rest of the postseason in Texas. 
Furthermore, under the new playoff format, a shortened best-of-three Wild Card Series means a bad start and some bad luck could be all it takes to send baseball’s best team packing early two years in a row. 
The Dodgers look like the best team in the league without a clear runner-up. Their offense ranks in the top five in runs, RBIs, OBP and SLG, and their 118 homers are the most by any MLB team.
Their pitching roster also looks great. Dodgers pitchers rank No. 1 in ERA at 3.02 and No. 2 in strikeout-to-walk ratio. Walker Buehler has returned from injury and will have the ball Wednesday against the Milwaukee Brewers.
Any time you have three former MVPs on one team, you should make a legitimate World Series run. The Dodgers have Kershaw, and he’s not even their Game 1 starter. Reigning MVP Bellinger isn’t even their best position player. This team has been to the World Series twice in the last three years and won 302 regular season games in those seasons, second only to the Astros, who … well, you get it. 
But nobody cares about the regular season wins, division titles and pennants. It’s time for baseball’s best team to finish the job. They’re deep, they’re talented, they have excellent pitching, and they’re hungry to win what was stolen from them in 2017. Anything less than a championship is unacceptable.
