USC lacrosse saw its nine-game win streak snapped when it lost 9-8 to Colorado at home Friday. However, the Trojans bounced back by defeating Oregon 16-0 Sunday in both the team’s and the Pac-12’s first-ever shutout.
The Trojans are still in first place in the Pac-12 despite losing to Colorado — their conference record is 8-1. 
The offense got out to a slow start against the Buffaloes, and the Trojans trailed 6-2 at halftime. The 2-goal mark is the lowest of the year for the Trojans in a half. 
USC struck first in the second half, with junior attacker Hope Anhut scoring less than two minutes into gameplay. USC outscored Colorado 6-3 in the second half and ultimately had the ball in position to tie the game with less than a minute left.
Junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller scored with 3:31 to go, putting USC within 1 goal. The Trojans possessed the ensuing draw with all the momentum on their side. Their comeback came up short, however, as the attack squandered the opportunity by not backing up a shot. 
Colorado regained possession and called a timeout with 1:39 left in the game and possession in hand. USC kicked its defense into full speed, attempting to cause a turnover in any way possible. With one minute remaining, Miller drew a yellow card for a false start. Now down a player, USC’s challenge grew steeper. 
Almost immediately upon restart of the game after the foul, sophomore midfielder Kelsey Huff created a turnover for USC. The forced turnover was Huff’s fourth of the day to go with six ground balls. Both numbers are career-highs. 
USC possessed the ball with 37 seconds to go but was short a player. The Colorado defense did not waver coming out of a timeout and forced senior attacker Emily Concialdi to take an awkward, off-balance shot which junior Colorado goalie Julia Lisella easily saved to end the game. 
USC committed 20 turnovers on the day, 15 of which were unforced. The Trojans had by far their worst day clearing the ball this year, going 14-22. The Trojans dominated Colorado on ground balls, collecting 30 to only 18 for the Buffaloes.
To say USC bounced back Sunday against Oregon is an understatement. Ten USC players scored during the match, led by freshman midfielder Erin Bakes who scored 4 goals.
Senior defender Jackie Gilbert dominated the draw circle for USC, collecting 10 draws herself. The Trojans’ advantage on the draw was an impressive 14-4. 
Gilbert and the defense extended their streak of not allowing an opponent to score more than 10 goals in eight games. 
USC shot the ball a total of 47 times, but Oregon freshman goalie Rachel Hall had 17 saves and proved a difficult challenge for the USC attackers. In most blowouts of this kind, the scoring typically comes early; however, USC scored just 7 goals in the first half. The onslaught of goals came after the break, displaying the depth of this Trojan roster. 
Freshman attacker Chelsea Kovinsky scored her first goal as a Trojan and the players on the bench exploded in support of their teammate. The team’s spirits are high even following the loss to Colorado that will no doubt affect its seeding later in the season. 
Next, USC will travel to the East Coast to face Stony Brook. They play at LaValle Stadium 9 a.m. Sunday.

USC won two out of three games against No. 7 Arizona State over the weekend.
The Trojans kicked off the weekend strong with a 10-6 victory Friday night. USC jumped out to an early 3-0 lead on RBI singles by junior outfielder Matthew Acosta in the first and third innings.
ASU cut its deficit to 2 in the top of the fourth, but USC fired back in the bottom half with 3 more runs. After senior infielder Brandon Perez hit an RBI triple and junior outfielder Blake Sabol provided an RBI groundout, Acosta again drove in a run on a single for a 6-1 Trojan lead.
Whenever ASU chipped into the lead, USC responded to keep the game out of reach.
“[Scoring insurance runs] makes the pitchers way more at ease,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “They know that they can make a mistake and can overcome it. It allowed [junior pitcher] Connor [Lunn] to pitch with a lot more freedom.”
When ASU made the score 6-3 in the top of the sixth, USC scored 3 more runs in the bottom half. Junior outfielder Brady Shockey scored when ASU catcher redshirt sophomore Sam Ferri made a throwing error on a double steal. Acosta doubled home Sabol, then stole home when Ferri tried to catch sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez stealing second.
An opposite field home run by Perez in the seventh gave the Trojans their 10th run of the game. ASU’s 3-run homer in the ninth was too little too late, as junior pitcher Austin Manning shut the door. 
Lunn held one of the nation’s top offenses in check with 6.1 innings of 3-run ball. He was assisted often by incredible defense, highlighted by a SportsCenter-worthy home run robbery by Acosta in the third inning to steal 3 runs from ASU.
“Right off the bat, I thought it was gone,” Acosta said. “And then I was like, ‘I’ve got a chance for that,’ … I found the wall, got a good jump and I got that.”
Lunn credited the performance as a team effort.
“I was just trying to pound the zone … let them get themselves out,” Lunn said. “[The defense] is huge, it gives me time to relax and just focus, and I know that the guys behind me will do what they do.”
Sabol’s three hits added to the 14-hit attack for the Trojans, but Acosta led the charge with four, also collecting five RBIs on the night.
On Saturday, the Trojans came back from a small deficit early to win 7-3. 
Sophomore infielder Spencer Torkelson gave ASU a 1-0 lead on a homer in the third inning.
However, the lead was short-lived. Sabol tripled home Perez to knot things up at 1. Redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs followed with his third home run of the year — a moonshot to left field — for the 3-1 lead. It was one of the longest home runs hit by any Trojan all season.
A home run by ASU sophomore infielder Alika Williams tied it up in the sixth. Acosta homered in the same inning to put the Trojans up 4-3. An error on a bunt by senior infielder Chase Bushor scored Ramirez, and an RBI single by freshman designated hitter Clay Owens gave USC a 3-run lead.
The red-hot Acosta homered again in the seventh inning. As soon as he hit it, Acosta stopped, watched it sail and gave an emphatic bat flip before breaking into his home run trot. 
Junior pitcher Chris Clarke closed out the victory with two scoreless innings in relief.
On Sunday, the Sun Devils avoided the sweep by defeating USC 11-8. 
ASU took a 2-0 lead in the first inning before Stubbs answered with his second home run of the series, a solo shot.
Perez tied the game with a triple in the second, but ASU took off from there. A 3-run home run from Torkelson helped the Sun Devils build an 11-3 lead.  
Sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt started for USC, struggling through 3.1 innings and allowing 5 earned runs. Freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain allowed 4 runs in the fifth inning but would settle down to shut ASU out the rest of the way.
The Trojans battled. Owens’ 2-run single in the fifth, sophomore first baseman Jamal O’Guinn’s RBI double in the sixth and Owens’ first career home run in the seventh made it an 11-7 ballgame.
After Stubbs struck out with the bases loaded in the ninth, O’Guinn walked to bring the winning run to the plate in Acosta, who lined out to right field to end the rally.
Despite the loss, the series victory against the Sun Devils was a positive sign for the Trojans, who move to 12-18 overall and 5-7 in conference play.  
USC will take on Cal State Fullerton at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Dedeaux Field. The 14-14 Titans defeated USC 10-4 in March, but Hubbs is hopeful after Sunday’s promising performance.
“We know they’re good,” Hubbs said Sunday. “If we have at bats like we did today and all weekend … we’re going to be in good shape.”

When former general manager Bill Polian initially decided to create a professional football league, he did not set out to dethrone the National Football League.
A former ESPN analyst, Super Bowl champion and one of the brightest minds in the sport, Polian understood that the Alliance for American Football was never meant to be a replacement for the face of America’s Game. Instead, the league looked to position itself as a strong complement to the sporting mega-giant.
But on April 2, the AAF officially announced that it would suspend operations eight weeks into a 10-week regular season. Upon receiving the news, Polian told members of the press that “the momentum generated by our players, coaches and football staff had us well positioned for future success. Regrettably, we will not have that opportunity.”
To his credit, the former Colts GM makes a strong point about the viability of the AAF. Games were broadcast weekly over networks such as NFL Network, B/R Live, CBS Sports Network and even premiered on national CBS the weekend after the Super Bowl. Aside from having a significant network presence, the league certainly generated enough interest — especially for its first year — to create a strong following. In its opening week, the league averaged almost 3 million viewers on a national network and continued to maintain a steady viewership of around 500,000 for the rest of the season.
These numbers will not shake the NFL to its core, but they demonstrate a strong showing for a first-year spring football league comprised of NFL flameouts and former college stars attempting to resurrect their careers.
Furthermore, the league offered an opportunity for non-traditional markets to maintain strong fanbases, which was the case for many teams. Clubs such as the Orlando Apollos (with a record of 7-1 and the heavy favorite to win the championship) and the Memphis Express (signed Johnny Manziel) drew significant interest despite being located in smaller, football-deprived markets.
However, there were inescapable problems that posed issues for the league throughout the season. 
Even though the league was impacted by another company’s mishandling of payroll, the league was bought out by Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon. With his purchase, Dundon aimed to infuse cash into a league that had run dry quickly. This began to cast a shadow over much of the season; a sense of distrust in league stability persisted until Dundon decided to suspend operations altogether. Players lived check to check on non-guaranteed contracts and wondered if the league would suddenly go under.
The league’s strategy from the outset was to complement to the NFL, but when the league balked at the opportunity to use the AAF as a minor league or development program, the AAF had no choice but to fold.
Although the league has failed with projects such as NFL Europe, the idea of a formal minor league for the NFL on American soil would represent a significant addition for the league. 
While obvious trepidation regarding liability and expenses would linger, the addition of a development league such as the AAF would give NFL teams more leeway and freedom to test out practice squad players in game environments. Additionally, opening the door for new markets remains one of the NFL’s key focuses. Exploring a footprint in places such as San Antonio, Birmingham and Salt Lake City would be a wise move for a league focused on global sport domination. Lastly, the rule changes and technological advancements put forth by the NFL could help usher the game into a new era of both excitement and efficient game times. It wouldn’t hurt to have a league in which new rule proposals could be tested, either.
From a player’s perspective, the AAF presents a paid opportunity to continue a career in professional football. While baseball, basketball and hockey each have alternative leagues in which players can make a living playing at home or overseas, no such option exists for football players. In the eyes of the NFLPA, a complementary (possibly minor league) system would allow players on the roster bubble to make money playing the game in the offseason.
The AAF represents the latest in a long line of failed football leagues. In five years, it’s possible that many will look back and laugh at the weird rules, the funny team names and the random collection of players. But at the same time, it is distinctly possible that a post-lockout NFL could look back on this decision as one that doomed the league in its much anticipated 2020 CBA negotiations.
However the league’s legacy comes to pass, the AAF certainly made an impact.

All the world is a screen. But, nowadays, it seems all the screen shows is the superhero narrative. 
Depending on how you feel about comic book movies and cinematic universes, we’re either living in the best of times or the worst of times. Superhero franchises dominate box offices because, for many people, the Avengers are the only thing worth getting up and buying a ticket for. In light of streaming services taking more and more people away from the “theater experience,” such an experience is actually not entirely extinct; rather, a rapturous, immersive experience is precisely what we want when we watch superhero movies. Rare is the person who will wait to watch “Avengers: Endgame” on DVD. 
These are our modern epics — “Avengers: Infinity War” is our “The Ten Commandments” or our “Lawrence of Arabia” in terms of size, scope and sheer popularity — they are our generation’s very own cinematic spectacles. According to BoxOfficeMojo, six of the 10 highest-grossing movies last year were superhero films. A range of obsessive fans, critics, apathetic viewers and haters abound, but one thing is for sure: Superhero movies cannot be ignored.
Movies are a means of escape, a time to disconnect from our world and join a new one. In my last column, I mentioned how we love horror movies because they allow us to experience a different reality we ultimately do not want to be our own. Yet, when it comes to superhero films, we really do want them to be real. 
This is why you have a whole community of fans who dedicate their lives to excavating Easter eggs, plotting out predictions, investing their emotions into the fate of these (fictional) characters. Even the casual fan gets invested when their favorite heroes are in peril; watching a human being with superpowers has a strange, captivating allure. Ultimately, we want the things superhero movies show us to be real. We want a hero.
Superheroes inject much-needed magic into our monotonous lives. Seeing a person fly is refreshing after living with that tedious law of gravity all day. These films not only let us consider what it would be like to fly and run fast, but they also display what we hope to see in everyone else: an uncompromising will to uphold all that is good in the world. 
In times of turmoil, it’s no wonder that we love heroes like Black Panther, who stands up for his people with unconditional love. But even T’Challa has his own inner demons. And that’s another thing we like in our heroes — something we’ve grown to demand as time has gone by: complexity.
Gone are the days of boy-scout Superman flaunting his pristine personality and handsome face. These are the days of Batman, a lawless vigilante whose moral compass is incessantly tried and tested. These are the days of Captain America, whose vintage righteousness is repeatedly challenged in the modern day. These are even the days of Venom and the Joker, who we root for even though we know they’re evil. As we realize how truly imperfect we are, our desire for a relatable superhero has led us to produce even these anti heroes and cheer them on because, in many ways, they’re more like all of us than Captain America is.  
To imagine a world without superheroes is quite difficult; even as we near the end of the Avengers’ 12-year saga, Marvel confirms and releases new films and trailers that assure us that this is far from the end. Superheroes are now essential parts of our entertainment world; they rake in revenue, they send fans down intellectual property rabbit holes and they give us a lens through which to understand the world. Good versus evil. Clear and simple is how we like it, especially when we know whose side we’re on.

Though “Black Sky” opens with a nearly bare stage, displaying a lone telephone pole with a spider web of orange electric cables running outward from it into the rafters, this world is unbelievably complex. The characters in this new School of Dramatic Arts production are dealing with serious, complex issues — sometimes with life-or-death stakes — and have nothing but each other to rely on for support. Accompanied with minimal set design, the world is created by the play’s five female leads and the openness they bring to their characters. 
These women are students Isabela Penagos (who plays KHawk), Nicole Havin (Violet), Casey Gardner (Diesel), Mary Zhang (Jana) and Vanessa Diego (Sachi). Each of them played a vital role in the process of developing the script and creating these characters alongside playwright Amanda Andrei and director, Rena Heinrich.
“Black Sky,” which premiered Friday, is the first of two plays in the School of Dramatic Arts’ New Works Festival, which began last weekend. The festival was designed to lend MFA Dramatic Writing candidates, like Andrei, the opportunity to workshop and refine their work by putting on a bare-bones production of it. 
“For New Works, it’s kind of an interesting process, just because everything is really constantly changing and flowing as things progress,” said actor Casey Gardner, a sophomore majoring in theatre. 
Both Gardner and fellow cast member Mary Zhang, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said it was rewarding to work so closely with the writer and director and to be able to ask questions and openly share their thoughts, which were often implemented into newer versions of the script.
Set in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia in a paramilitary program for young girls, a freak electrical storm strikes as the team repairs an electrical grid, causing major injuries and stirring tensions within the team. 
“All of us have such unique character background stories but [the cast] comes together really well with this beautiful story,” Zhang said. “A lot of the play is about nature versus technology, and when technology takes over, it’s really easy to lose that humanity and the things that come out of genuine human connections.”
Despite the tense conflict presented in this play, humanity was one thing that was certainly not lost. The characters — with distinct sets of traits and complex problems and who struggle in relationships with each other and on their own as they strive both for independence and connection — embody empathy and sacrifice for one another. These characters are imperfect, but the simultaneous strength and vulnerability the actors brought to their portrayals are what made them so compelling to watch.
While the minimal set and technical elements allowed for the story and the words to be featured prominently, it didn’t hinder the actors from effectively telling the story. A few stone set pieces were placed in different configurations that instantly transported the audience to different locations. 
The world’s sound designed by Alma Reyes-Thomas, an independent sound designer who often works on USC’s productions, filled in the rest of the technical shortcomings by conveying what the set could not: a loud sizzling to indicate they were only a few feet away from a massive electrical grid, sudden silence as the power was turned off, a massive explosion somewhere off-stage. 
Set in an unknown and ambiguous future time period, the play required the actors to create futuristic world with new and established norms that the audience could latch onto and believe in. 
The playwright, however, did not belittle her audiences by over-explaining the parameters of the world. Instead, she incorporated elements of this futuristic society into the play and trusted the audience to eventually catch on. The characters often spoke in text-speak, spelling out “i-d-k” and “w-t-f,” and used terms like “blue” to mean cool or good, and “sad mad bad” as part of their commonplace speaking. This suggested a world not too different from our own, but one in which customs and practices have evolved.  
Raising questions about what the future looks like for young women, the central themes revolved around a woman’s autonomy over her body and the basic human need to connect. Gardner expressed her respect for the way the play normalizes all aspects of the female body, which are often skimmed over or ignored. 
“There’s so much going on in this world especially in the future where technology could be taking over,” Zhang said. “Know that at the end, it comes back to the connections you make with the people around you.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month promising to enforce the First Amendment in colleges across the country. He vowed to withhold federal funding from universities that do not comply. Not so surprisingly for today’s political climate, the political left, the very founders of the free speech movement, attacked the executive order. But one does not have to be a supporter of the president to acknowledge that there is, in fact, a free speech problem on college campuses. 
Much of the backlash has come from the University of California system, which is apparently “ground zero for robust exchanges of ideas and differing viewpoints,” according to UC system President Janet Napolitano.
Erwin Chermerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law, and Howard Gillman, Chancellor of UC Irvine, wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, contending that the executive order is unnecessary and unconstitutionally vague. 
The unconstitutionality of the executive order is one argument, whose merits will surely be decided by the courts. But the UC administrators continue by making a non-legal argument that there is no free speech problem on American campuses today — “There is no crisis concerning free speech on campuses in the United States,” they write. 
Napolitano wrote in a statement, “The executive order that President Trump signed today is unnecessary. Like many higher education institutions across the country, the University of California is ground zero for robust exchanges of ideas and differing viewpoints.” 
This statement is categorically false.
We are living in an era when certain groups believe they have the right to remove someone else’s freedom of speech if they find it offensive. The problem is that offensiveness can only be judged by those who experience it; it isn’t an objective standard. It is difficult to have a respectful debate about abortion, privilege or immigration with no ad hominem attacks. Luckily, USC did not cave in after several groups tried to shut down conservative speaker Ben Shapiro’s talk on campus last fall. 
But the free speech problem extends far beyond one specific event; it has to do with today’s debate culture. Last week, as I was scrolling through Facebook, I saw two people furiously debating an issue in the comments of a post, each of them raising novel and brilliant points. But the last of one debater’s comments said she was going to block her opponent because of the argument. The user went on to qualify her blocking in saying, “I think you’re a super nice guy tho and I wish you the best. I just don’t want to continue getting into fb arguments w you or your friends over an issue that we clearly see very differently.” 
While everyone can certainly block whomever they would like on their private Facebook accounts, the implications of this particular example are troubling. Blocking on a private Facebook account, choosing not to listen to someone you disagree with — while unproductive and narrow-minded — is perfectly legal. But if a college were to practice the equivalent by shutting down someone’s ability to speak to those who do want to listen, it would not be legal. Blocking or unfriending someone perpetuates an echo chamber and prevents healthy debate. And if that is something a social media user wants, by all means they can arrange that for themselves. But he should not be allowed to force that upon those who do seek to be exposed to an adversarial viewpoint.  
Protesting the content of someone’s opinion is different from protesting that person’s right to speak in the first place. The former is the essence of the First Amendment, and the latter is the antithesis. The first is an act of confidence and the second is an act of cowardice. The first cannot coexist with the second. 
College administrators must realize that many students are advocating the censorship of speech they disagree with. While the specifics of President Trump’s executive order may need some tweaking, it is concerning that so many higher education leaders are dismissing the entire proposition as preposterous. It certainly isn’t, as Napolitano believes, “misguided.”

In the Daily Trojan cover story from April 2, “Getting in — then getting fed,” you examined the critical and under-addressed problem of student food insecurity and hunger. I appreciate your coverage of this topic. However, there were a few key points the article missed. 
I supervise the Late Night Hot Meal program you mention (we call it Late Night Café) at the United University Church. It was created by students because there was no food pantry at USC. As the food pantry becomes incrementally better, there are still rules that limit access to the food pantry. It was created precisely to spread awareness about student hunger and food insecurity and to be a resource for the students affected. 
In the article, there was no mention of how food insecurity impacts graduate or international students. At Late Night Café, most of the students we serve each week are international students, and close to half of those who come are graduate students. There is less financial support for graduate students than for undergraduate students, and there are fewer financial resources like federal loans and grants available to international students than U.S. citizens. The only aid they can receive are merit-based scholarships, but only a small percentage of those students receive those scholarships. The rest of these graduate students are on their own. With regard to international students, there is a perception that the international students at USC come from very wealthy families. That is not the case with every single international student. 
The fact that USC has not addressed food insecurity for all this time is very disappointing. The fact that the Undergraduate Student Government is putting more money into the food pantry than USC itself is upsetting. Although overlooking food insecurity is an epidemic on many campuses across the United States, as one of the wealthiest universities in the country, USC must take the lead in ensuring that no one on campus goes hungry. If the University can find money to fund high-level projects like renovating athletic facilities, then it can surely help eliminate hunger on campus. The article mentions our program as a resource. Although we do our best to serve the USC community in raising awareness for this issue, we simply do not have the budget to do more. USC must take care of all of its students, especially with regard to the basic need for food. 
This is not to take away from what the writers identified in the article — hunger is hunger; financial hardship is financial hardship. However, we would appreciate it if the Daily Trojan explored this issue further. Broadening the scope of inquiry reveals food insecurity and the related economic stress impacts a wide variety of students across degree programs and demographics.
