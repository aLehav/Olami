Katie Chin | Daily TrojanOut and proud · Harrison grew up in Kansas, but she did not become involved with the LGBT community until she was in college. Harrison attended University of Missouri-Kansas City and Northwestern University.
USC’s LGBT Resource Center director, Reverend Kelby Harrison, wasn’t always involved in the LGBT community. 
“I grew up in Wichita, Kan. … Kansas is fairly conservative, and I didn’t come out as gay until I was a teenager,” Harrison said. 
However, that changed when Harrison attended Northwestern University for her doctorate degree. 
“I left for college [at the University of Missouri-Kansas City] and then went to Northwestern for my Ph.D. program, and that’s where I really got involved with the LGBT community,” Harrison said. “I was openly gay by the time college was over, but it wasn’t until I got to Chicago that I connected with the campus communities and off-campus communities and got involved in activism.”
Harrison founded  Northwestern’s first-ever LGBT graduate student organization, the Queer Pride Graduate Student Association, and through that group, also founded the Queertopia conference, where graduate students from across the nation came to share their academic research on LGBT-related issues. 
The LGBT community even found its way into Harrison’s education. She graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City with a degree in philosophy and ethics, but her doctorate from Northwestern was in ethics, gender and sexuality. 
Harrison went on to publish her dissertation for the degree as a book Sexual Deceit: The Ethics of  Passing which explores the morals behind passing, or presenting oneself as one thing while one’s identity is something else. The book specifically explores queer individuals who pass as heterosexual. 
However, LGBT issues weren’t all that Harrison became passionate about in graduate school. It was there that she also rediscovered a love for faith and spirituality. 
“I loved religion as a child … but I broke from religion at about 16, when I started figuring out how misogynistic and homophobic religion could be,” Harrison said. “But in graduate school, I came back to Liberal Christianity … that led me to getting a job as a postdoctoral fellow at the Union Theological Seminary, which is kind of known for being the premier social justice seminary in the country, very much dedicated to black liberation theology [and] LGBT inclusion.”
It was while teaching at the seminary that Harrison became ordained as a reverend, at a similarly LGBT-inclusive church, the Metropolitan Community Church. 
After leaving the seminary, Harrison came to Los Angeles. While she initially came to Southern California as a hospital chaplain for the UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, she soon found that USC was her true calling. 
“I wasn’t in Los Angeles very long before I figured out that USC was the school of choice around here. It very much reminds me of Northwestern, [so] I started looking for employment at USC,” Harrison said. “I kept my eye on the University … and [when] this position came to open, and it was absolutely ideal. It was the combination of both my academic studies, my activism and the institution I wanted to work at. I got lucky.”
Harrison has worked to improve the quality of life for LGBT students and increase their presence on campus. She successfully advocated for the addition of the Lavender Lounge, a safe space for LGBT students to unwind and interact, which more than doubled the LGBT Resource Center’s space on campus. Just two years ago, USC’s LGBT center was found to be the smallest among top academic institutions.
“She was really passionate about getting that student lounge … the moment we had that space officially and no one could take it back, she was so excited,” said Erica Kirk, former lead graduate assistant at the LGBT Resource Center. ”It was finally a place for students to hang out where we weren’t all on top of each other,” 
Aside from the Lavender Lounge, Harrison has dedicated her days to making USC more inclusive. She worked with the Title IX office at USC to get an all-gender restroom next to the LGBT Resource Center, created peer support systems for members of the LGBT community and was even recognized nationally for making USC welcoming for international LGBT students.
However, Harrison’s true passion for being the center’s director lies in working with individual students, according to Michael Gorse, the LGBT Resource Center supervisor. He’s been working with Harrison for more than three years, both as a graduate assistant at the center while studying at USC, and as center supervisor now. 
“She really enjoys working with students one-on-one … she’s able to develop personal connections with the students she’s working with at the center,” Gorse said. “She’s very good at and willing to listen to people non-judgmentally and connect with them.”
Kirk said that Harrison fosters such strong relationships with students on campus because she goes above and beyond to show them she cares.
“She is infinitely empathetic,” Kirk said. “She still emails me about my job search, and checks in on me. It could have very easily been like, ‘Okay, you don’t work for me anymore, we’re done,’ but she takes the time to check in, and see where I’m at and I’m sure she does that will with all of her staff, and all of the students she comes in contact with, because she cares, a lot.”
Despite all the successes she’s had as the resource center director, Harrison has even bigger goals in mind for the LGBT center. 
“In upcoming years, we’re going to … really begin to focus on queer and trans students of color, focusing more on inclusivity efforts for students of color, and working more closely with the other cultural centers on campus,” Harrison said. 
Another effort that the center is working on is providing resources for the mental health of LGBT students. 
“Last week, we both went to San Jose [to become] instructors so we can train our student staff and colleagues on how to help someone who presents mental health issues or a mental health crisis … Kelby’s been doing a lot of work on expanding our understanding [of mental health], as well as services that are offered for students who are experiencing mental health issues,” Gorse said.
Beyond working at the LGBT Resource Center, Harrison is still able to utilize her background in faith and religion. She works at the Office of Religious Life as the Dean of Spirituality and Sexuality, allowing her to help students work through the intersectionality of their faith and sexual orientation or gender identity, which she knows from firsthand experience can be a difficult path to navigate alone. 
“[After] being in the world of religion for a number of years, it’s nice to still have that connection to the world of religion through USC,” Harrison said. 
Through her life’s work in spirituality, ethics and queer advocacy, Harrison finds fulfillment in seeing real progress for the LGBT community.
“It’s really satisfying to see institutions get better around LGBT issues … I have watched USC grow; I watched Northwestern grow,” Harrison said. “Right now, there are rainbow flags all along [Trousdale Parkway], which is lovely. We didn’t even have to put pressure on the school to do it. It’s so great to see that positive institutional reaction. I think it’s a modern sign of ethical improvement, when institutions get better.”

Photo Courtesy of USC NewsHere to help · Neelesh Tiruviluamala, Laura Baker and John Pascarella are three of the six new faculty members who will live in USC Village’s residential colleges. They were selected from a pool of 17 finalists.
Come August, a total of 23 professors will live among students in the 14 residential colleges spread throughout campus, including the addition of six for the new USC Village. Each residential faculty member was selected through a competitive application process for a term of four years. 
Director for Residential Education Emily Sandoval espouses the benefits of students and professors sharing a common living space, which she said helps bridge the gap between the classroom experience and living experience. Students are allowed to form closer, more personal connections with the faculty, she said.
“They lower that invisible wall, that barrier, that sometimes students see faculty behind,” Sandoval said. “They become more human. They’re people. They’re sharing their space, their families, sometimes pets, welcoming students into their homes.” 
These include professors Trisha Tucker in McCarthy Honors College, Carla Della Gatta in West Residential College, Caroline Muglia in Parkside International Residential College and Edwin Hill in Parkside Arts & Humanities Residential College. 
Seventeen finalists were invited for a half day of interviews where the screening committee and residential education student leaders learned more about each candidate. The final step was a social assessment, where the applicants were invited to attend one of two social events after work. 
Ultimately, the six faculty members were chosen.
“I call it a legacy,” Sandoval said. “Especially with the USC Village being brand new, that doesn’t have any traditions, so we get to set the traditions, and start the traditions and start a history that doesn’t exist.” 
The six faculty who will live in the USC Village include Tucker and  Pascarella in the McCarthy Honors College, Ruth Chung in USC Village’s Building 6, Neelesh Tiruviluamala in Building 7, Broderick Leaks in Building 8 and Laura Baker in Building 9. 
John Pascarella has been involved in residential education for five years, but this upcoming year will be his first time leading programming for the honors college. Previously a high school teacher, Pascarella now teaches graduate students at the Rossier School of Education. He saw residential education as an opportunity to interact more with undergraduates. 
“It’s a big commitment to serve the students of our campus,” Pascarella said. “The point is we’re here living amongst the students and we create programming that connects home, profession, and academics, as well as social opportunities. We’re there if they need to talk to any adult adviser or a mentor and having immediate access to that person on a fairly open basis.” 
Pascarella notes that residential education has several benefits for faculty such as experiencing campus life and the convenience of not having to commute in L.A. traffic. But he takes part in the program because he sees it first and foremost as a “service-oriented commitment.” 
Trisha Tucker will join Pascarella as the second residential faculty member in McCarthy. It will be Tucker’s first year in the residential education program — as a professor, that is. Tucker was a USC honors student during her undergraduate years, where she was influenced particularly by her former residential faculty member and current USC professor Viet Thanh Nguyen. 
Tucker’s overwhelmingly positive experience living in the honors college contributed greatly to her decision to become a residential faculty member herself. 
“It was where I met my best friends throughout college and really where I got to feel like part of the USC community,” Tucker said. “I believe that the residential experience is really impactful for students and I wanted to be a part of that as a faculty member.” 
Even though her position is competitive, Tucker said being a residential faculty member does not speak to everyone. 
“It attracts a very specific type of professor,” Tucker said. “It can’t be the type of professor who wants to teach their expertise, teach the thing that they already know, and then go home. I think [residential educators] see teaching as not just an occupation but a calling and a lifestyle.”
 
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that there are eight residential colleges spread throughout campus. There are actually 14 in total, including the eight located at the USC Village.
The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Former USC football star and Athletic Director Mike Garrett and his lawyers are filing a motion to dismiss a case against him alleging he sexually harassed a colleague working at Cal State Los Angeles.
The initial case against Garrett was filed Aug. 29, 2016 in the Los Angeles Superior Court by Cal State L.A. senior associate Shelia Hudson, who claimed Garrett referred to her and other female employees as “Babe,” “Sweetheart,” “Love” and “Legs” while serving as athletic director of CSULA.
Garrett and his lawyers have long denied the allegations, and last week filed papers asking for a dismissal of the trial citing lack of evidence. The hearing date regarding the motion to dismiss is set for Aug. 30. 
Court papers filed by Garrett’s lawyers argue Hudson targeted Garrett because she felt the athletic director position was stolen from her after former director Dan Bridges retired in 2015. 
Defense lawyers for Garrett have also suggested that he used “gender neutral terms of endearment” in addressing both men and women on his staff, including current athletic director Daryl Gross. According to the defense’s paperwork, three women who Hudson claimed were harassed were interviewed and determined to not have been insulted by Garrett’s words. 
During depositions, Garrett said Hudson was missing from the office regularly, making it difficult to assess her skill set.
Hudson was sued by her former employer and three CSULA employees, alleging she secretly recorded conversations with them in 2016. In Hudson’s deposition, she admitted to using her cell phone to record conversations with three plaintiffs. 
Hudson’s lawyer said her client may soon file a counter claim for wrongful termination. 
Garrett, a Los Angeles native, went to Roosevelt High School and attended USC as a star halfback. He won the Heisman Trophy and was named UPI College Player of the Year in 1965 while playing for the Trojans. He played eight seasons in the NFL, for both the Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers. He retired after two AFL championships and a Super Bowl ring. 
He then returned to Los Angeles and served a 17-season tenure as USC’s athletic director, during which he returned USC football to the national spotlight. Following USC president C. L. Max Nikias’ inauguration in 2010, it was announced that Pat Haden would replace Garrett.

Two Trojan alumni have been nominated for ESPY Awards after standout performances at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Allyson Felix became the most decorated American woman in Olympic track and field history last summer, which earned her a nomination for Best Female U.S. Olympic Athlete. Swimmer Katinka Hosszu, who represented Hungary in Rio de Janeiro, is nominated for Best International Athlete.
Felix grabbed three medals in 2016 to raise her career total to nine, which tied Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey for most-ever in Olympic women’s track and field. She won two gold medals — in the 4x100m and 4x400m relays — and one silver in the 400m. The two gold medals gave her six total: the most in Trojan history. Rio was Felix’s fourth Games after competing in Athens, Beijing and London.
Felix actually never ran for USC. Despite committing to the Trojans in high school, she opted to sign a professional contract with Adidas to prepare for the 2004 Olympics. She still attended the University, however, and graduated in 2008 with a degree in elementary education.
On the other hand, Hosszu enjoyed a dominant Trojan career. She graduated in 2012 as a five-time NCAA champion, and she took home three of those titles in her junior season — becoming only the second swimmer to pull off the feat in program history. Hosszu also won the 2011 Honda Award, which is given to the nation’s top female collegiate swimmer.
Though she didn’t earn a medal at the previous three Games, Hosszu’s Olympic career is now similarly decorated after she won four medals — three gold, one silver — last summer. Hosszu smashed the world record in the 400m IM in the first day of swimming in Rio, and she set an Olympic record in the 200m IM three days later.
She also made a comeback in the final length of the 100m backstroke to win gold and notched a silver medal in the 200m backstroke, only missing out on another first-place finish by .06 seconds. No other swimmer at the Rio Olympics won more individual events.
Neither Hosszu nor Felix is a stranger to the ESPY Awards. Felix has been nominated for Best Track and Field Athlete three times, and she won the Best Female Track Athlete award in 2006. Hosszu, meanwhile, was nominated for Best Female College Athlete in 2011.
Voting for the ESPY Awards is currently open online, and the ceremony will take place on July 12 at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.

Sarah Kim | Daily TrojanStepping up · Forward Hailey Hite will aim to provide more firepower in her junior season after USC graduated two of its three top goalscorers.
The USC women’s soccer team announced its 2017 schedule last Tuesday, as the reigning national champions prepare to defend their first title under fourth-year head coach Keidane McAlpine. The Trojans have a challenging slate on tap this fall, matching up against eight teams that made the NCAA Tournament last year.
The team will raise its championship banner to open the new season at home against UC Davis on Aug. 18. Before the players officially begin their campaign, however, they will play two preseason exhibition games: one against UC Irvine at McAlister Field on Aug. 11 and another at Long Beach State two days later.
USC will play seven non-conference matches prior to kicking off Pac-12 play in late September. After facing UC Davis, the Trojans head east to take on two 2016 NCAA Tournament competitors, Missouri and Kansas, away from home. McAlpine’s squad then returns to Los Angeles to host Santa Clara — who advanced to the Elite Eight last year — as USC aims to avenge one of its four total losses from the previous campaign.
Finally, the Trojans face Iowa State at McAlister Field before wrapping up their non-conference schedule with games on the road against Loyola Marymount and San Diego.
“We have a non-conference schedule that will challenge our team and prepare us for the difficulties we will face in Pac-12 play,” McAlpine said. “I am very excited to see how this new mix of women are able to carry on the standards set by the 2016 national championship team.”
As is the case every year, USC is scheduled to play each of its 11 conference opponents once in 2017. The team begins with a tough road trip on Sept. 23 to challenge Utah, who pushed the Trojans to a double-overtime draw in Salt Lake City last fall. The two sides met again in the NCAA Tournament, and USC bounced the Utes from the bracket, advancing to the Sweet 16 thanks to a late goal from sophomore striker Leah Pruitt.
The team plays its Pac-12 home opener after the trip to Utah, as Oregon State visits McAlister Field on Sept. 28, followed by Oregon on Oct. 1.
Though the Pac-12 provides challenges every week, the Trojans will really run the gantlet near the end of the regular season. They will play rematches against the only two conference rivals to beat them last year — Cal and UCLA — with a game against perennial championship contender Stanford sandwiched in-between. USC will host the Bears and Cardinal at McAlister Field on Oct. 26 and Oct. 29, respectively, then conclude the regular season in Westwood on Nov. 3.
 The Trojans prepare for the upcoming campaign after losing a key chunk of its championship core over the offseason. Five seniors were drafted into the National Women’s Soccer League, including Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year Sammy Jo Prudhomme and 2016 MAC Hermann Trophy finalist Morgan Andrews.
Striker Alex Anthony last year’s joint-top scorer on the team with 10 goals, returns for her redshirt senior season, however. Pruitt is back in the fold as well, after chipping in four goals and eight assists in 2016. With plenty of returning talent and a six-member recruiting class ready to cut its teeth, the Trojans will look to continue their championship form without skipping a beat this fall.

Katie Chin | Daily TrojanFlying high · Redshirt sophomore Marquís Morris was one of many USC student-athletes and graduates competing at last week’s USATF Championships in Sacramento, Calif. Morris was a semifinalist in the 110m hurdles, while Trojan alumnus Aleec Harris triumphed in the finals to claim the national title.
The USC track program shone at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships last week, with both alumni and collegiate stars impressing during the four-day competition in Sacramento, Calif. Former Trojans Dalilah Muhammad and Aleec Harris earned titles in the 400m hurdles and 110m hurdles, respectively, and current Trojans smashed multiple team records.
At the meet, five USC runners — four graduates and junior Kendall Ellis — qualified to represent the United States at the IAAF World Championships in August. Ellis will team up with Trojan track greats Muhammad, Harris, Allyson Felix and Nia Ali as they gun for glory in London. Ellis and Felix will both run the 400m, Harris will enter the 110m hurdles and Muhammad will compete in the 400m hurdles.
Muhammad earned her second career USA title in the women’s 400m hurdles on the last day of action at Hornet Stadium. The 2016 Olympic gold medalist recorded a personal-best time of 52.64 to win the finals, while Harris topped the men’s 110m hurdles with a time of 13.24.
For the current Trojans, Anna Cockrell competed in the women’s 400m hurdles finals and finished eighth overall (55.14), breaking her USC freshman record in the process. Junior Deanna Hill recorded a time of 23.04 to come in sixth in the women’s 200m finals.
Numerous USC athletes also starred in the competition’s earlier days. Ellis broke her own all-time school record in the 400m on Friday and repeated the feat Saturday. She trimmed her first time of 50.24 down to 50.00 flat to take third overall and earn a spot on the USA roster. Michael Norman bettered his USC freshman record in the 400m on Saturday, running to finals qualification in 44.60 seconds. The time also elevated Norman to third place on the program’s all-time 400m list.
Senior Cameron Pettigrew qualified for the 400m semifinals with a time of 51.74, and junior Ricky Morgan Jr. also advanced on the men’s side after recording a time of 45.47 — just .03 seconds from his personal best.
Redshirt sophomore Marquís Morris ran in Harris’ heat in the first round of the 110m hurdles, and he qualified for the semifinals with a 13.73 mark while Harris won the heat. Morris did not advance to the finals, however, settling for 14th overall.
After the end of the USATF Championships, Trojan athletes will look forward to rooting on Cockrell at the biennial World Championships, which features more than 200 countries. The United States is the winningest nation in the competition’s history.
The IAAF World Championships kick off on Aug. 4 at London Stadium.

Despite their popularity, competitive reality shows have never been remarkably successful at producing lasting talents. It might be because marketability isn’t the first priority of winners, or that the market is simply too competitive to ensure a spot for every winner or runner-up.
However, a few artists have managed to cement themselves in the industry, successfully using their platform to catapult themselves into a future of sold-out tours and triple-platinum singles. Those include One Direction, Carrie Underwood — and most recently — Fifth Harmony. 
Fifth Harmony was a surprise. After being formed by Demi Lovato and Simon Cowell to qualify for the group category in The X Factor’s second season, the contestants had a transition period to decide what their identity as a group should be. Each of the five had incredibly strong vocal talent, and they only seemed to get better as each episode progressed. However, even by the end of the season, if viewers were asked which group would have successful careers, they would have likely said Emblem3, Fifth Harmony’s male counterpart. The market seemed to demand boy bands and Emblem3 fit perfectly as teenage music sensations. Since then, Emblem3 faded into oblivion while Fifth Harmony produced two studio albums and several chart-topping singles. 
Fifth Harmony established themselves as the most popular girl group of the new generation — a void that desperately needed to be filled after the dissolution of the Pussycat Dolls and Danity Kane. The girls found their niche: empowered women of color who didn’t shy away from sexuality, feminism or achievement. Their songs echoed with dynamism and fierceness, and their vocal talents shined through in every hit. Making their way around venues across the world, Fifth Harmony performed catchy pop tunes and built up a sizable fanbase of Harmonizers. The girls had broken into a seemingly impenetrable mold — and they looked good doing it, too. 
When Camila Cabello announced in December 2016 that she was leaving Fifth Harmony to pursue a solo career, fans were upset, to say the least, but would have been naive to be surprised. The girls had always been talented individually, and Cabello had already been featured on a Shawn Mendes song. As expected by a group that had formed on a whim — even one as successful as Fifth Harmony — the group members would inevitably itch to go solo and try their hand at an independent career. The real question: Would the first person to jump ship be able to carry their own success? 
From the beginning of the band, it was clear that Cabello had something unique. Her incredible voice control allowed her to navigate difficult riffs with complete ease and she had a unique sound. Still, vocal talent is not quite enough to build a strong solo career. Perhaps it was her time with Fifth Harmony, her contacts in the music world or something entirely different, but Cabello thrived the moment she broke free. Her single “Crying in the Club” gained immense popularity, as did “Bad Things,” her collaboration with Machine Gun Kelly. 
She has proven to be a force to be reckoned with and has piqued the interest of fans, ex-fans and skeptics alike. If she continues to use her talent to navigate the pop market and makes smart collaborative decisions, Cabello could join the leagues of Zara Larsson and Alessia Cara — budding talents and fiercely talented pop princesses. 
The other members of Fifth Harmony have expressed interest in pursuing solo projects and careers as well, mirroring the footsteps of fellow The X Factor graduates One Direction. Out of the remaining four, Lauren Jauregui immediately emerges as the best candidate. An avid social justice advocate and one of the more prominent soloists from the beginning, Jauregui has already shaped her own persona outside the group. Also proving her capacities by being featured on Halsey’s song “Strangers,” she is the natural favorite to rise to the top. 
Whether or not Fifth Harmony decides to stay together or disband, the group has played an important role in promoting feminism, diversity and sexuality in music.  Each member has the potential to cement herself as a force in pop music, some more likely than others. While the group’s future remains unknown, Fifth Harmony opened the door for a new generation of Spice Girls and Destiny’s Children — and that’s an accomplishment worth noting for years to come.

Imagine Dragons’ new album is by no means revolutionary, but it’s definitely evolutionary. In the rock band’s third LP Evolve, old sounds are mixed with new influences based on contemporary radio hits.
Further deviating from the band’s rock origins, Evolve is a mish-mash of electronic and pop-tinged anthems that attempt to veer from the emotional detonations that dominated their sophomore record, Smoke + Mirrors. Though not quite as impressive as the band’s multi-platinum debut Night Visions, Evolve is a testament to Imagine Dragons’ remarkable capability of transcending genre-based barriers that have kept rock musicians from making it to the top of today’s pop music-dominated charts.
Arguably the band’s most successful single to date, “Radioactive” still holds the all-time record for its 87-week appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. And currently at No. 15, the album’s lead single “Believer” is one of the only exceptions to a Top 25 dominated by pop, electronic, hip-hop and in-between hits on the radio. Aside from “Believer,” Evolve demonstrates the concerning idea that artists must singularly appeal to pop listeners to have career longevity and lasting success.
Photo courtesy of Interscope RecordsIt’s an evolution, I suppose · Las Vegas-native band Imagine Dragons released its third LP Evolve on June 23. The album comes after the success of Night Visions and Smoke + Mirrors, featuring lead single “Believer.”
The record’s synthy opener “I Don’t Know Why” is bouncy, yet lifeless — with manufactured lyrics such as “I don’t know why but it’s got something to do with you” that strive to bring an awkward mid-tempo song to pop-EDM catchiness. The following track, “Whatever It Takes,” serves as another example of the band’s clunky songwriting, as lead vocalist Dan Reynolds sings his verses and choruses in an unnatural rap-like rhythm. 
Similarly, “Dancing in the Dark” and “Yesterday” both signify Imagine Dragons’ ambitious attempts to blend rock with mainstream influences. Neither catchy nor memorable, these songs leave listeners confused about the band’s clumsy rock-electronic blend. But as proven, Imagine Dragons is not the typical rock band. 
In Evolve, it seems like Imagine Dragons is trading theatricality for more nuanced sounds. But in the midst of this experimentation, the band performs best when it’s not trying as hard to sound different — it’s in the songs balancing the new and old that best captures the band’s progression as contemporary rock musicians.
With a feel-good message and stompy beats reminiscent of breakout hit “It’s Time,” “Walking the Wire” is one of the better songs on Evolve’s tracklist. Though Imagine Dragons uses less acoustics and more synths here, the song is evidence of the group’s potential to achieve 2017-style music stardom while not completely straying from their roots. “Start Over” powers through as another worthy anthem — not because it’s game-changing, but because it successfully combines tropical house influences with Reynolds’ thunderous chorus chant-roars (the same ones that brought “Radioactive” to chart-topping success). 
“Thunder,” the album’s second single, is the final piece of the puzzle, proving Imagine Dragons’ aptitude for bringing new sounds and influences into their music production. Though still at No. 87 on the Billboard Top 100 chart, the single could be yet another sleeper hit by the band (“Radioactive” entered the charts at No. 96 in September 2012 and stayed in the low end until April 2013).
Although Imagine Dragons is heading into new musical territory, one thing remains clear: The band will continue to stay relevant in the contemporary music scene. It wasn’t mere wonder or luck that catapulted Reynolds and his mates out of obscurity — it was their uncanny ability to blend arena rock with pop-worthy chants into power ballads. And while Evolve is not necessarily a cohesive work, it serves as a lesson for current musicians looking to break through genre barriers: Successful evolution is a compromise between new and old influences.
I LOVE Imagine Dragons and the release of Evolve is somewhat of a disspaointment. Smoke + Mirrors is an amazing compiltation of music but Evolve is not the same.  When my 17 year old daughter – who completely related to Night Visions – complains about the music released on Evolve, it’s evident the wait didn’t measure up.  I guess the message is don’t deviate. Know what where you excel and grow beyond your comfort zone … just don’t leave it.

It is no secret that colleges are a hotbed for sexual misconduct: According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, it is in fact one of the most prevalent crimes on campus.
It’s also not a secret that student-athletes are often the perpetrators. The Benedict Crosset study revealed that one in three sexual assaults are committed by athletes, with conviction rates disproportionately low in comparison to general perpetrators. And it only takes a glance at news headlines to fully realize the ubiquity of the issue. Schools all across the nation have had recent scandals involving the
cover-up of athletes’ sexual violence. Pac-12 athletes such as Stanford’s Brock Turner and USC’s own Osa Masina and Don Hill have been in the national spotlight for sexual misconduct. With this in mind, universities must hold their athletes accountable for their actions on and off the playing field. They should also carefully investigate athletes and potential recruits’ criminal record and take necessary steps to ensure prevention of sexual misconduct on campus.
The most recent scandal that brought headlines was at Oregon State University. It was revealed that Luke Heimlich, a star player on OSU’s baseball team, is a registered sex offender convicted of molesting a 6-year-old family member when he was 15. Horrifyingly enough, the university has not yet stated whether they were aware of Heimlich’s offense when he was recruited. Meanwhile the athletic director and baseball coach have remained silent. OSU claims that it “follows the U.S. Department of Education’s recommendation that universities not allow criminal history to affect disproportionately a student’s access to higher education.” This defense sounds reasonable until one takes into account that Heimlich isn’t only a student; he is an athlete who enjoys special privileges due to his status as a star player, which reaps enormous profit for Oregon State. In such cases, universities must reexamine their pledge to higher education instead of shielding their athletic reputation with a lack of transparency.
The aforementioned Benedict Crosset study found that male student-athletes are disproportionately responsible for on-campus sexual assault. While they make up a mere 3.3 percent of the average college campus, they are found to be responsible for 19 percent of reported sexual assault across the U.S. However, the National Collegiate Athletic Association currently does not require recruiters to investigate their athletes. Federal law only demands that some sex offenses be disclosed to universities, while crimes committed out-of-state or while underage (as often would be the case for high school students being recruited) could go undetected entirely.
Just as recruiters investigate other potential issues with the athletes they recruit, such as a history of drug abuse or learning disabilities, they also must research criminal background and any sexual misconduct related to the student. As studies show that these student-athletes are disproportionately responsible for sexual misconduct, a thorough vetting process is the essential first step to prevent any potential crime once the athlete is on campus.
Although students who have committed crimes in the past should be allowed to reassimilate themselves into society and not face discrimination in the admissions or recruitment process, university officials must acknowledge these risks and be transparent about their findings, especially if a case like Oregon State University’s rises up. For a well-known public figure like Oregon State’s Heimlich, the school would ideally step up and admit his past failures, while pledging support to sexual assault prevention initiatives. Of course, universities must be willing to be transparent in these cases, despite having their reputations on the line.
According to USC Student Affairs, university athletes are disciplined according to the student code of conduct; that is, they face the same consequences (or lack thereof) as any other student who committed the same infraction. While this is meant to guarantee that student-athletes are treated equally alongside the rest of the student population, it disregards the privilege of playing on a highly publicized Division I sports team. These institutional privileges granted by the school often get them out of trouble, instead of facing revocation in violating the code of conduct. At USC, for example, Osa Masina only received a one-game suspension initially in the midst of an ongoing sexual assault investigation. Although Masina was eventually removed from both the football team and USC campus, this announcement came weeks after the announcement of the investigation.
Since student-athletes hold an elevated status on campus with privileges beyond those of the general student population, they too must be held to a higher standard and scrutiny under the athletic directors and university officials in regards to sexual misconduct and crime.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
The Women’s March created a spark of female millennial activism in January that spread to cities across the nation. It all feels like a distant memory now. That is not to say that young women across this nation and across all stages of life have taken a step back since January; they remain active and vigilant in tracking the new presidential administration’s attacks on their rights, but nonetheless, these attacks are still being dealt seemingly on the daily in continuous blows. 
As a result of these blows, earlier this month, a new study by the Population Reference Bureau claims millennial American women are worse off than their mothers were at their age in the era of President Donald Trump, with rising incarceration rates, higher poverty rates and increases in suicide and maternal mortality. This study sharply contradicts a powerful, overarching narrative that young women today live cushioned lives, and merits new dialogue and support for a demographic that has become a vulnerable target in today’s political climate.
“It looks like millennial women’s progress has stalled and slightly reversed relative to their mothers’ and their grandmothers’ generations,” Mark Mather, an author of the study, told the Huffington Post.
The study reveals maternal mortality rates have risen substantially; the United States has a higher mortality rate of 19.2 pregnancy-related deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies, up from 7.5 since the Baby Boomer generation. This number is greater than in any other developed nation, and the United States is the only developed nation with a rate that is rising, not decreasing. New struggles in accessing reproductive health care and receiving adequate health insurance in recent years appear to be driving this. With the pending Senate health care bill that threatens to freeze one year of federal funding for Planned Parenthood, these policies jeopardize the direction of women’s progress
“During the 1970s, as abortion policies were liberalized, maternal mortality rates fell dramatically,” the report states. “In recent years, the maternal mortality rate rose as federal and state policies began restricting access to reproductive health services.” 
The study also notes that “improvements in fetal and infant care” made over the past decades, despite being “designed to reduce infant mortality and improve child health, have not been paralleled by — and have sometimes come at the expense of — care for women in the postpartum period.” 
Historically speaking, in the wake of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, there was hardly a shortage of open abortion clinics. Now, many states in rural America have only one or two abortion clinics to serve millions of women, as a result of new laws targeting these clinics over the past five years. 
Regulations known as TRAP laws, an acronym for “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” impose medically unnecessary and expensive hospital requirements on clinics, resulting in many closing, as clinics do not receive funding to offer abortion under federal law. Despite how these laws are passed in the name of keeping women safe, by closing clinics that offer a crucial health service, they tend to have the opposite effect. 
And simultaneously, with renewed attacks on the Obama-era Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate, as well as the passage of legislation that will allow states to withhold federal funding from Planned Parenthood, many young women are losing access to the resources that allowed their mothers to receive educations and work. 
Previous academic studies have revealed how access to affordable birth control allowed millions of women to thrive by granting them autonomy over their bodies and, as a result due to the inherent interconnectedness of economic enfranchisement and reproductive justice, live with economic security. President Trump has not been shy about his intent to dismantle the Obama administration’s legacy across the board, but President Obama’s hand in expanding women’s rights is taking a disproportionately powerful blow, as these gains made over the previous presidential administration are now being torn apart. At this point, researchers and women’s health experts can really only guess the disastrous consequences these policies will unleash on women’s futures.
These renewed struggles to accessing crucial health care run parallel to rising poverty rates among young women. The poverty rate among this demographic has spiked 37 percent in the last 15 years, making it exponentially more difficult for these women to access the health care they need. 
With costs of living on the rise and continual, systemic bias skewing the opportunities women have access to, poverty has largely become a young women’s issue — one the Trump administration seems content to ignore. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has previously expressed doubt that women can’t afford birth control, while Secretary  of Education Betsy DeVos has taken an active role in making student loans more unforgiving for college students. Simultaneously, in proposed budgets, Trump’s budget directors are consistently slashing the social safety net to pieces.
This study offers a fresh rebuttal to these stereotypes but simultaneously offers young women little encouragement. It’s so often said that the Women’s March must be treated as a “start,” that this activism must not go away, and indeed, this new study speaks for itself. 
But in addition to sending young women the clear message that they have their work cut out for them, its findings will also hopefully yield a new culture of support and respect toward this demographic, rather than one that undermines their life experiences.
