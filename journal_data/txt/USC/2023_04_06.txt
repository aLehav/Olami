Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, Brady and Gronk, even Shaq and Kobe; a number of players have made their mark on their respective sports as individuals, but their legacy together as teammates is far greater. 
At USC, there is a Trojan duo that may too come to demonstrate the unique dominance of all-time teammates. Freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein and freshman setter Ryan Sprague have developed competitive chemistry beyond their years, and it has shown on the court this season. It’s clear that the two freshmen have special talent individually. 
Klein has exploded onto the men’s volleyball scene this season. He is fourth in the MPSF with 298 kills and is a frontrunner for MPSF freshman of the year. With freak athleticism and one of the most powerful right arms in the sport, Klein has developed into the primary scorer on offense for the Trojans, despite being only a freshman. 
“Klein embraced the role that we gave him to be the go-to guy,” said Head Coach Jeff Nygaard. “I think that’s a role that he not only wants, we all recognize that it’s the right fit.”
Sprague hasn’t been an instant star to the same degree partially because he is still waiting his turn to be a full time starter behind USC’s other extremely talented setter, junior Nate Tennant. However, he has still seen plenty of game action, often checking into the match in some of the Trojans’ most high pressure situations and providing an offensive spark off the bench. 
In those moments, his passion for the game has shined through tremendously. There may be people who love the game of volleyball as much as Sprague, but you probably won’t find anyone who loves it more than him. 
“I love every moment I get to be out there in Galen,” Sprague said. “It’s awesome, there’s literally nothing like it.” 
The pair are great players, and if they had gone their separate ways in college, they probably would have still seen great success. But together as Trojans, they have a chance to be something even more special for two reasons. 
For one, their positions make developing their skills together a necessity. Being a setter, Spague’s primary responsibility is to rack up assists, dishing perfect sets to his teammates who can then score points. Klein, being a starting outside hitter and the go-to guy on offense, is who Trojan setters look to the most to convert those scoring opportunities. It’s in their best interest to learn how to play well together and depend on one another, because it will maximize their potential and help the team have the greatest level of success. 
The second reason they seem headed for greatness is because they have already built that togetherness. It’s something they’ve been building for years: The two are great friends and have played for years together, including in high school and on their club team. 
The Trojan family may just now be getting to know them, but their coach at Loyola High School, Michael Boehle, knew they were special from the moment he first started coaching them. 
“[Klein] and [Sprague] were both ahead of their time because they were both gifted in certain aspects,” Boehle said. “Dillon was freak-athletic, jump out of the gym guy, and Ryan was competitive, gonna win however we can win, and even from an early age demanded a lot [from] his teammates.” 
Boehle added that they stood out for their competitiveness and ability to take constructive criticism in order to get better. 
They also became natural friends who enjoy many off the field activities together, including golf, which they play together often. While golfing over the summer this past year, Klein hit a hole in one on the 18th hole at a resort in Cabo San Lucas, which the two of them said is one of their favorite memories together. 
It seems as though, because of their volleyball skills, competitiveness and friendship, they were always destined to become a dynamic duo on the court. 
Two years ago, they settled into their current positions, setter and outside hitter, while at Loyola High School. Having worked on their chemistry as teammates for two years prior to USC, they have a head start on other teams in the conference.
“[Sprague] set me for the past two years, and building a setter-hitter connection can take a while, but coming into the program already having that connection down is really beneficial,” Klein said. 
Their experience playing together has allowed them to know one another’s tendencies and way of thinking inherently. The result has been an incredible on-court connection that has impressed everyone. 
“There’s a lot of non-verbal communication,” Nygaard said. “Something will happen, Ryan will throw a ball up, DK just knows it’s coming.” 
It’s also made their transition from high school to college easier and more fun. 
“I feel like I’m pretty comfortable on the court with him because I’ve just done it before,” Sprague said. “When I’m getting thrown into a game or something it’s not a big deal because it’s like okay, I’m just playing with Dillon, it’s not anything too crazy.” 
USC has two extremely talented freshmen who play volleyball at a high level and are also elite at being teammates, to the point where they already have an unspoken understanding of one another and inherently know how to play together. The rest of the MPSF should be very afraid. 
Even watching from a distance, Boehle is a huge believer in their future, and in the team’s future. 
“A few times, I’ve got to see my guys that I coached at the national championship … I hope [Klein and Sprague] get an opportunity to do that,” Boehle said. “I think they are very capable with the coaching staff that’s in place to make a run at that [in] their next three years, 100%.” 
Fortunately for Trojan fans, that belief is echoed by Klein and Sprague themselves. 
“Every year I want to win the conference tournament and I want to win an NCAA championship,” Sprague said. 
Even this year? 
“As soon as possible,” Klein said. “Ryan and I want to win for this team … sure, we might have three more years of eligibility, but we’re really focused on this year.” 
Regardless of what the results are in the next few years, they’re definitely going to exemplify teamwork and excellence. If they’re already playing at a high level now, their potential for growth individually and as teammates is sky-high.
By the time they’re done, Sprague and Klein could be an iconic, all-time volleyball duo. Current and future Trojans should make sure to watch them on the court before their jerseys are already in the rafters.

USC’s men’s and women’s track and field teams will compete at home in the Ron and Sharlene Allice Trojan Invitational at Allyson Felix Field in the Loker Track Stadium and Colich Center on Friday and Saturday. This event marks the second invitational of the outdoor season. 
Currently, the women’s outdoor track and field team ranks No. 2 in the nation while the men’s team sits at No. 16. At the Trojans’ first invitational of the season, the Aztec Invitational at San Diego State University March 25, both the women’s and men’s teams won, scoring 154.5 and 160 points, respectively. As a whole, the team earned first-place in nine events.
As the Trojan Invitational approaches, USC Director of Track and Field and Cross Country Quincy Watts says the focus is on building the confidence of his athletes. 
“Just because they are freshman and sophomore does not mean they don’t belong,” Watts said. “I want them to have that confidence because they are among the best, they are among the best in terms of times-wise and throws and marks in the nation. I just want them to believe that they are regardless of how young they are.”
In 2022, the women’s track and field team earned fourth at the Pac-12s and 30th at the NCAA championship while the men’s team earned third at Pac-12s and 12th at the NCAA championship. At the moment, Watts has his sights set on winning the Pac-12 championship, placing top 12 in the West and eventually winning the national championship. 
“We want to advance as many student athletes as possible,” Watts said. “Once you advance as many student athletes as possible, then you have a great opportunity to score.”
Sophomore Gigi Maccagnini, who won the 800m at the Aztec Invitational, hopes to set a personal record and compete for a national championship. At the Trojan Invitational she will compete in the 400m. 
“I’m actually doing the 400 just to work on the speed aspect of the 800,” Maccagnini said. “In terms of the 800 there’s still a little bit of work to do for the rest of the season. I need to finish off the last 200 of my race and my coach and I are working on that in training.”
Graduate student Bobby Poynter, who won the 800m and 1500m at San Diego State, believes the team is on the right trajectory to compete at nationals. 
“The best thing I could do is just be a leader for others and do my part, and that’s going to help the team as a whole,” Poynter said. “The team’s definitely a bit younger so I think especially indoors you might have had some growing pains and some things we had to work out but I think the group is starting to mature a little bit and I definitely have a lot of excitement and promise for the rest of this outdoor season.”
The Ron and Sharlene Allice Trojan Invitational is set to begin at noon Friday at the South Bay Throws Facility with women’s discus throw. On Saturday, the meet will continue at the Allyson Felix in the Katherine B Loker Track Stadium, with field events beginning at 10 a.m. and running events starting at 11:30 a.m.

From March 22-25, the men’s Swimming and Diving Team competed in this year’s NCAA championships in Minnesota. They ended the weekend with a 22nd-place finish. 
In men’s swimming, sophomore Artem Selin finished 32nd in the 50-yard freestyle, while sophomore Chris O’Grady finished 34th in the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke. 
In the 1-meter diving event, sophomore Wang Shangfei earned fifth, freshman Laurent Gosselin-Paradis placed 18th and senior George Korovin placed 33rd. The 3-meter was USC’s standout event, with Wang as the runner-up and Korovin finishing 17th. For both 1-meter and 3-meter, Wang earned All-American honors, awarded for finishing in the top eight of an event.
“Actually, second place, I didn’t expect this situation [to] happen,” said Wang in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I was just thinking: Get through it, as soon as I’m done I can take some time for break. But apparently the performance level was quite high.”
Wang also competed in the NCAAs last year, finishing 11th in the 3-meter.
“For the first year, I was trying to push myself to perform [at] the best level I could,” Wang said. “But actually, diving is a complicated sport. Once you really want something, especially on board, you really can’t control your body to perform that well.”
Wang’s second-place finish on 3-meter marks USC’s best result in men’s diving since Head Coach Li Hongping joined in 1999.
“His performance was electrified,” Li said. “I seldomly will [stand] up and cheer for my athletes unless they perform above or beyond their level of my expectations, and Shangfei made me stand up twice last week for two of his dives.”
At the Pac-12 postseason awards, Wang won Diver of the Year, Gosselin-Paradis won Freshman Diver of the Year and Li won Men’s Diving Coach of the Year for the sixth time.
Women’s Swimming and Diving NCAAs in Knoxville, held from March 15-18, also had standout performances from divers. Graduate student Lina Sculti took sixth place in the 1-meter and 3-meter events. Senior Nike Agunbiade finished fifth on platform. Both divers won All-American honors for their results.
“Their performance was outstanding,” Li said. “I’m very pleased. Overall, it has been a very rewarding season for my diving program.”
In women’s swimming, junior Kaitlyn Dobler performed well, finishing fourth in the 100-yard breaststroke and earning an All-American honor. Fifth-year Isabelle Odgers placed 14th in the same event and 8th in the 200-yard breaststroke. The team finished tenth in both the 200-yard medley relay and the 400-yard medley relay. Overall, the women’s swim and dive team combined to finish 12th at the NCAAs, an improvement on their 16th-place finish last year.
“Swimming and diving really came together to have a much better performance than we had last year, which was something that I know everyone was really excited about,” Odgers said. “I think that the upward trajectory that we’re on is just a testament to the teamwork and to the camaraderie between us.”
Odgers’ last swim for USC was the 200-yard breaststroke, which was her best ever performance on the team. 
“This was a really special way for me to wrap up my collegiate swimming career. I’m really excited to be leaving with the All-American honors in the 200 breaststroke,” Odgers said. “And I think that the team is in a much better place than we’ve been in in the past. I know that this is just the tip of the iceberg for all the incredible things that they’re going to accomplish next year.”
Li said he is also excited for his athletes to continue their success next season.
“When I went into the NCAA season this year, I anticipated that this [was] going to be a very good season for us. And it turned out it’s not just good. It was amazing,” Li said. “I’m hoping that we continue to keep up the momentum of how well we trained.”

No. 12 men’s volleyball will head uptown to Pauley Pavilion to take on UCLA this Thursday. They’ll head back down to Galen Center Friday to face them once more, in the third to last game of the regular season.
The Trojans are on a skid lately in a season that hasn’t been kind to them. They’re 8-13 after losing their last six games, and 2-11 in games against ranked opponents. They’ve won just one road match. But perhaps the most important game against their dreaded rival, who also happens to be ranked as one of the top teams in the nation, is just what they need to right the ship.
“I know we’re going to come out with our best effort,” said freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein, who leads the team in kills with 299. “I really do think we can beat this team.”
It certainly will take the Trojans’ best effort to knock off UCLA. Besides being ranked No. 2 in the country, the Bruins are 23-2 on the season, are undefeated in conference play and undefeated at Pauley Pavilion. It will have been nearly a month since their last loss when they play USC Thursday. 
But Head Coach Jeff Nygaard knows that his team won’t back down from a strong opponent and that they’ll go into it looking to make a statement.
“Rivalry means that we’re gonna be super focused, and wanting it, and we’re gonna have a lot of intensity to go out there and compete,” Nygaard said. “They’re playing some good volleyball, [but] we know what we’re capable of.”
Nygaard also noted that the will to compete in his team is only rising as the season nears its end and as the MPSF tournament shows itself on the horizon.
“It’s getting more and more intense on a daily basis. Guys are going down deep into that competitive spirit and they’re galvanizing,” Nygaard said. “They’re really coming together in a positive way saying ‘we’ve gotta get this done, we’ve gotta work harder and smarter, we’ve gotta be more intentful and intense’ … they’re responding positively. They know that we have a shot.”
Nygaard says they’ve used their close losses as positive mental reinforcement, and that his team is choosing to grow rather than allowing adversity to tear them down. He also mentioned that despite the recent series loss to BYU, he’s noticing that his team is growing closer and that that’s what he wants to see as the season nears a close.
“There was a moment at BYU where every single guy in unison said exactly the same thing in real time. That’s how you know that the guys are bought in and on point… we’re starting to really put it together,” Nygard said.
The team knows they need to focus on the here and now, with UCLA next on the schedule. But they also know their goal goes above and beyond just beating them. 
“UCLA might underestimate us just a little bit considering our losing streak and our record. Honestly, that doesn’t change a thing in our mind,” Klein said. “We have one goal and one goal only: Win the MPSF tournament and make it to the NCAA [tournament].”
Game one of the series will be Thursday at 7 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion, and game two will take place Saturday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

In an ever-changing world, FC Bayern Munchen refuses to comply. In fact, they’re the exact opposite by being the definition of absolute consistency. They have been champions of the Bundesliga for the past 10 years and finished in the top three for the past 14 years. This level of dominance is unheard of and has never been seen before. 
Before Bayern, the Boston Celtics were known as the best dynasty after winning eight NBA championships in a row from 1959 to 1966. Now, 9 and 10-year-olds have never known anything except Bayren’s dominance in the German league. To give this feat more context, their first title during this remarkable streak in 2013 took place at the same time as the following events: the Harlem Shake was a viral trend, Apple released the iPhone 5s, Flappy Bird still existed and Taylor Swift started her The Red Tour. I do not define myself as a Swifty, but could Taylor Swift’s newest The Eras tour signify the end of Bayern’s reign? If you are a German soccer fan, you sure hope so.
During the streak, Borussia Dortmund has finished in second place six times. Although most of the title races have not been particularly close, it does make German soccer fans wonder what a world without Bayern would look like. However, this year could be the year everything changes. 
After matchday 26, Bayern currently holds a two-point advantage over Dortmund. During that week, Dortmund turned in an unimpressive performance against Bayern and lost their position as league leaders. After just 50 minutes, Bayern jumped out to a commanding 4-0 lead, and Dortmund was never able to recover.  Since they have no upcoming games coming this season, Bayern now controls their destiny. The famous rivalry between the two clubs, Der Klassiker, has been dominated by Bayern winning 68 times out of 133 tries. 
Although history has not been kind to Dortmund, this year could be their year. However, their window to return as Bundesliga champions is extremely tight. Dortmund is known for its development system because they have produced some of the most talented young players on the planet. 
Instead of stockpiling these players, they are often sold to larger European Squads like Manchester City, Real Madrid or even Bayern. The starting 11 they currently have is the perfect mixture of experienced leadership and exciting young talent. Players like Mats Hummels, Giovanni Reyna, Marco Reus and Jude Bellingham are amongst the best at the position and have a questionable future at the club.
In addition to having a championship-worthy roster to compete against, Bayern also has to worry about utilizing its depth to play in multiple competitions simultaneously. Teams are rarely able to secure a treble because it requires perfect performances in short spans of time against some of the best teams in the world. 
Bayern will have their hands full in the UEFA Champions League with their tie against Manchester City. In addition to that, they faced off against other top-ranking German Squads in the DFB Cup until recently getting knocked out by SC Freiburg. Their tricky schedule doesn’t end there either. In four of their last eight league matches, they will face a squad currently sitting in the top half of the table.
Dortmund is not the only team Bayern has to look out for. They are the complete opposite to the normal standard of squad fans usually see challenging for the title. Only being in the top flight since 2019, Union Berlin has some of the most dedicated fans who built the stadium themselves and have even donated blood for the club to get extra funds. They have also shown progress each season in the Bundesliga by finishing higher each season compared to the last. 
Despite all of this recent success, those who run the club still thrive off the small club atmosphere because they are aware of their origin. After the Berlin Wall was constructed, Union Berlin became the team that the working class resonated with, and it has survived generations. A team with passion and support like this and nothing to lose is certainly a dark horse candidate to dethrone the kings.
For all of these reasons and more, this year’s title race in Germany will be the most exciting one we’ve seen this decade. It would be a fitting end to see the German giants fall the same way they began: during a Taylor Swift concert tour.

Located only a few blocks from his Hollywood star, the “One Love Experience” at The Ovation Hollywood is a deeply interactive exhibit dedicated to the legacy of reggae icon Bob Marley. Initially set to run until April 23, the exhibit has been extended through May 21. 
The journey through Marley’s rise to fame greets visitors with a showcase of the platinum and gold records he earned throughout his lifetime. Among the various vinyls and relics stands an enormous vinyl record piece, painted in rasta stripes, symbolizing the magnitude of his world impact musically. 
Following the music room is the One Love Forest, a teleportation into Nine Mile, the Jamaican village where Marley was born. With a careful ear, one can hear sounds of the tropical jungle, animal shrieks, chirping birds and plants rustling in the wind. Filled with lush greenery, the One Love Forest depicts the climate of the countryside, a prime location for harvesting marijuana, which is largely associated with Marley and Rastafarian culture. 
Between the leaves on the walls are large prints of Marley “smoking herb,” as he called it. Marley believed the herb was the healing of a nation, and the act of smoking it was a large part of his religion, lifestyle and lyrics. The feeling of relaxation is felt from head to toe the second visitors step into the room. The cannabis garden is complete with a sculpture of a giant joint, a wooden swing for photos and bean bag chairs placed throughout for individuals to sit down and enjoy the calm ambience before moving to the music in the Soul Shakedown studio. 
Inspired by the track “Soul Shakedown Party,” this section of the exhibit provides headphones for visitors to catch a rhythm and feel the joy of Bob Marley and the Wailers’ music flow through their bodies under a glimmering disco ball. The studio is perhaps one of the most sensory parts of the experience. The walls are lined with incredible concert photographs and a filmed live performance projection. 
Aside from Marley’s passion for music, the “Three Little Birds” singer also had a great affection for the game of football. When away from the recording studio, he could be found at a park dribbling a ball between his feet or scrimmaging against his friends. According to the BBC, the sport brought out a competitive side to him and mesmerized those who watched him play. To highlight his love for the sport and stir up a bit of friendly competition, emerges the beautiful Life zone. The space holds a foosball table, soccer net and pinball machine for guests to enjoy. Among the games are action shots of Marley on the field, as well as a display of Adidas shoes, still speckled with dirt from gameplay. 
Moving out of the zone and into the concrete jungle, brightly colored murals and graffiti pieces captivate viewers’ eyes with striking street art. Trash cans and wooden benches are coated with vibrant spray paint, and rainbow colored bricks form the background for pop-art style portraits. The art here references the style of art featured in inner-city areas across the globe, such as Kingston, the city Marley’s hit song “War”  is about. 
Lyrics from tracks such as “War” can also be seen between murals. The content of the lyrics speak on themes of discrimination and poverty that marginalized groups are subjected to due to racism. 
The placement of the seating facing directly in front of the art creates an area of reflection about the harsh conditions of living in an environment such as West Kingston, but also the resilience of its residents and ability to create beauty through art. 
The “One Love Experience” is completed with a section focused on Bob Marley’s children and grandchildren, highlighting their accomplishments as music artists. The room mainly contains photographs, but in the center is a large sculpture of a tree with clothing pins dangling from long strings, holding notecards. 
Surrounding the tree are tables with pencils and blank cards where visitors answer the prompt “What does one love mean to you?” to close the experience, leaving visitors feeling reflective, united and radiant.

For My Betsy, music is a love language. Whether it be in the act of concocting new sounds among friends or playing electrifying house shows for their growing fan base at USC, it is in the band’s nature to bring people together through the power of good music and good company.
My Betsy is the brainchild of frontwoman Betsy Schmeler, backed by her cohort of talented Thornton musicians Meena Aspeytia, Tayler Somerville, Jordan Radnoti and Sergio Rodriguez. 
Set to release on April 7, their newest EP, “Distracted Driving/Veggie Song”, written and recorded by Schmeler, features the original songs “Distracted Driving” and “Veggie Song.” The band’s publicist Thays Figueiredo — a sophomore majoring in music industry, also responsible for mixing and mastering the EP — said that these juxtaposing tracks offer “a good read on how people in our generation are feeling.”
“Distracted Driving” is a hard-hitting confessional that transports listeners into the subconscious thoughts of a person in a distant, despondent frame of mind, referencing the zoned-out mentality our generation is all too familiar with. 
“The whole thing of the song is about being in a very spacey mindset, being distracted, and we’re trying to create that vibe within the music,” Figueiredo said. “It’s very reverb-heavy … and a lot of the instruments [have] low pass filters on them to make them feel a little bit rounded and muffled, just to create that feeling of spacey-ness within the mix.”
“Veggie Song,” on the other hand, boasts a much more lighthearted spirit, inviting listeners to remember the bigger picture despite the chaos they may experience in their day-to-day lives. This sentiment is especially reflected in the mix’s DIY approach, most noticeable through Aspeytia and Schmeler’s use of alternate percussion. 
“We honestly just started grabbing random shit,” said Aspeytia, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “We put some coins in a can, got some cardboard out, got some pans. We also had my keys, and that’s what created some of the sounds you’re hearing on the track.”
When listening to these songs, Schmeler’s lyricism is what truly shines through. With the to-the-point vulnerability of Phoebe Bridgers and Faye Webster, Schmeler is able to establish a deep-rooted connection with her audience, and because she is comfortable sharing these heavy feelings within the public domain, listeners feel less alone.
“Really what My Betsy is all about is love,” said bassist Somerville, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “Generating love within our music and sharing it with other people who we love, allowing [them] to express their problems … is what My Betsy is all about.” 
My Betsy was born out of friendship, and according to Schmeler, “it just made perfect sense.” 
“I feel like they all just really support the music that I write,” said Schmeler, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “Because they’re my friends, they’re just like, ‘Yeah, Betsy, we get your vision, and we’ll make the sounds you want to hear with your music.’” 
Champions of the USC vs. UCLA battle of the bands, My Betsy has become a regular headliner within USC’s slew of student-run shows. In attending one of their performances, such as their post-Springfest EP celebration this Friday, it would become immediately obvious why. 
The band’s camaraderie is contagious, and aside from their undeniable talent, it’s their strongest asset. Somehow combining an approachable, laid-back demeanor with an impassioned eagerness to put on a good show, My Betsy seamlessly bridges the gap between audience and performer, making each performance a unified, shared experience. They’ve been gifted with a unique ability to make listeners feel like part of something bigger than themselves, which is all they hoped to do in the first place. 
“I’ve always craved a scene and community, always been looking for it,” Schmeler said. 
In forming My Betsy, Schmeler made the decision to build that for herself and her friends. Continuing to play live shows and produce new music, My Betsy has been able to foster the environment of support that they wanted for themselves. This is what they were searching for, and they welcome listeners to join them. 
“It’s all about making space for people and building a community,” Schmeler said. “For me, that’s really the root of everything. It’s fun to write songs and stuff, but I have a lot more fun sharing that with people.”

I want to start this column off with an apology to the boy in elementary school who asked me nearly every week if he could borrow my Pokémon handbook. I had agreed, wanting to be nice and generous even though that handbook filled with artistically rendered creatures of a Japanese media franchise was, in my mind, the most valuable possession I ever owned at that time. 
“Are you done with that book yet?” he’d stand by my desk and ask.
I’d been done with it weeks ago, but being the stingy seven-year-old I was, I didn’t think sharing was caring and had started regretting my decision to be nice. I’d respond that I was still reading it — because I was, just for the eighth time — and he’d look skeptical. 
“You’ve been saying that for a long time,” he’d say. I’d shrug and he’d move away, looking disgruntled. 
It’s now more than a decade later, and I think I donated that Pokémon handbook to the local library a couple of years back. Still, the fact I remember that I never actually let him borrow that book is ingrained in my mind. I think about that and start questioning my sense of morality. Maybe I’m a bad person. Why didn’t I just let him borrow it?
Looking beyond these internal considerations of myself, I have to note that I’m bringing up that incident because Pokémon, deemed the “most valuable media franchise of all time,” was the heart of Asian American youth like myself and the boy who asked to borrow it. There was no shopping together or eating together back then, as are perhaps the main activities of college students today.
Instead, it was sitting down on the floor with your friends and spreading out your trading cards. I’d ask for Chansey in exchange for my Buneary and Pachirisu, then abruptly change my mind because who cared about HP — or Hit Points — when Buneary and Pachirisu were just so cute? We’d negotiate, and sometimes all of us would leave happy, sometimes not. That was how we communicated, and Pokémon was the foundation of friendship.
After trading cards came one of the animated Nintendo games. Which version it was, I don’t quite remember. What I do remember is that it was fun for a while. My uncle lived in San Francisco at the time, and we would drive the hour to visit him on the weekends. He’d play the game with me, teaching me how to battle gym leaders effectively. My Mandarin was limited, leaving it difficult to talk to my uncle, but gaming needed no explanation. 
I stopped playing that game some time after. My uncle moved back to Taiwan, and my frustration at consistently losing a major battle encouraged not persistence, but the decision to give up. Pokémon, though, has come to represent different stages of my childhood. 
Although Pokémon appeals to everyone regardless of origin, it is especially significant for many members of the Asian diaspora. Writing for Fanbyte, George Yang uses different Pokémon to speak about their relationship with his identity growing up as a Chinese American, citing Braviary as one of them. 
“[Braviary] looks like the most American, most patriotic Pokemon ever. And that’s exactly the point,” Yang writes. “Braviary speaks to my identity as not only Chinese, but also American. As Asian Americans, we often struggle to navigate our dual identities.”
Aside from Pokémon being metaphorical creatures for the divisions and conflicts that may be associated with Asian American identity, the Pokémon Go mobile game spawns a whole new way of celebrating Asian identity on a transnational scale.
My aunt and cousin live in Taiwan, and whenever I visit, they’re always playing Pokémon Go. It doesn’t matter what year it is or how many months have passed since. I watch them play Pokémon Go on their phones and iPads, asking questions and making comments about the Pokémon they’re collecting. My uncle doesn’t have children of his own, but he plays Pokémon Go too so that there’s always a topic of discussion. Occasionally, he and I reminisce about the times that we played the Pokémon Nintendo game in his little San Francisco apartment.
“You were much cuter then,” he argues. Of course I was. Back then, my biggest struggle was whether or not I should let that boy borrow my Pokémon handbook. 
In an article for Hyphen Magazine, Allen Mark Arañas observes that mostly Asian Americans in their 20s and 30s have been playing the game. He expresses that Pokémon Go is the “vessel of Asian American nostalgia” and the “symbol of API culture.” I’d agree. There’s just something about the cultural diffusion that has occurred from Japan to Taiwan, to other countries in Asia and all over the world. 
Go onto the “Subtle Asian Traits” Facebook group, which connects the global Asian community, and one will see that Pokémon is one of the major points of connection. Pokémon are mechanisms to highlight certain aspects of shared identity and experience. There’s no handbook to being Asian, but Pokémon can certainly give us a way to talk about it. 
I really, really should have let him borrow that book.

The International Criminal Court filed a warrant March 17 for the arrest of President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the presidential commissioner for children’s rights in Russia, for alleged war crimes relating to the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. The Daily Trojan spoke with USC experts in international relations and law to get a better sense of what the action signifies to the international community, as well as how the matter is being taken closer to home.
Russian authorities under Lvova-Belova’s direction, the ICC alleged, seized Ukrainian children from border cities and put them up for adoption by Russian families — often telling them that they weren’t wanted by their parents. The effort was allegedly part of a wider attempt to integrate them as Russian citizens.
The warrant operates under the authority of the Rome Statute, an ICC treaty that defines and addresses four central international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. The ICC in its warrant alleged Putin and Lvova-Belova committed the acts of deportation directly, jointly with or through others, and “in prejudice of Ukrainian children.” Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for the Kremlin, has dismissed the allegations as “outrageous and unacceptable,” and the warrant “null and void.”
While the warrant will not reach every corner of the globe, the 133 countries — including 18 in the Eastern European region, a third of which directly border with Russia — who have signed onto the Rome Statute are under the legal obligation to arrest him. Notable non-signatories include Russia, China, Israel, Iraq, India, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, the United States and Ukraine itself.
Robert English, a professor of international relations and co-director of Central European studies, said that, while it was “highly unlikely” that the warrant would at any point lead to Putin’s actual arrest, it still had “strong symbolic meaning.”
“It reminds the world of the atrocities being committed in Ukraine, but it probably won’t have any real effect on the war,” English said. “I don’t think it’s likely he’ll be traveling to a country where he’d be at risk, and, unfortunately, even … when indicted, [not all criminals have] been arrested by countries who are signatories to the statute.”
With widespread discussion surrounding Russia’s alleged war crimes during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, some may wonder why the deportation of children has been the only action to lead to an ICC warrant. This, English said, is a matter of direct evidence to Putin.
“A lot of the crimes and atrocities that have been committed [are] very difficult to trace, even up to senior commanders, much less to the President,” English said. “In this case, though, there was a policy, and some of [the children’s deportations] was done quite openly.”
Apart from the symbolism and travel ban that comes with Putin’s and Lvova-Belova’s potential arrest, there could also be the possibility of a special tribunal being convened, separately from the ICC, to address not only the child deportations, but also the crime of aggression against the Ukrainian border in the first place, said Steven Lamy, professor of international relations, spatial sciences and environmental studies.
“People are really disgusted with the fact that people like Putin get away with things,” Lamy said. “[There] could be a tribunal where he’s convicted, [but] the most likely scenario with a tribunal would be lower-level people being victimized.”
So far, members of the European Parliament and the U.S. State Department have supported a proposed joint tribunal to try Russian leaders on the aggression crime alongside the efforts of the ICC. Members of the European Parliament argued that “atrocities committed by Russian forces … underscore the importance of coordinated international action to bring those accountable to justice under international law,” and a tribunal would serve this purpose, filling “a vacuum in international criminal justice,” a Jan. 19 press release read. 
The U.S., as a non-signatory country to the Rome Statute, has lauded the charges against Putin, yet is not under the jurisdiction of the arrest warrant itself. President Joe Biden has called the decision “justified,” and has repeatedly made public comments about the clarity of Putin’s alleged war crimes. In separate remarks to the press March 27, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack likened the tribunal to the Nuremberg trials following World War II — in which “the United States led the prosecution of the crime of aggression, deemed ‘crimes against the peace’ in the lexicon of the era.”
Hannah Garry, founding director of the International Human Rights Clinic at the Gould School of Law, said there has been strong bipartisan support to cooperate with the ICC on the Ukrainian matter, but expressed doubt that Congress would currently be willing to ratify the Rome Statute.
“It is my hope that in the future, it will lead to the U.S. actually becoming a full-fledged safe party, but I don’t think that’s anywhere in the near future,” Garry said.
As calls to prosecute Putin have grown, some critics have accused the ICC and the U.S. of hypocrisy. A March 21 letter to The Guardian opined that “a more fitting description to go with its acronym is international court of cowardice.” Jeremy Scahill, writing for The Intercept, noted the irony of a country — whose Congress in 2002 passed a bipartisan bill authorizing the use of “all means necessary and appropriate” to liberate a U.S. official, soldier or contractor imprisoned by the ICC — now enthusiastically supporting prosecution of Putin’s alleged war crimes. 
​​”We sometimes seem extremely sanctimonious in the eyes of the rest of the world,” English said. “Often the criticism [from allies and developing countries is] that these are laws written by wealthy white Europeans and only applied to Black Africans. Where’s the indictment for George Bush and Tony Blair, for invading Iraq illegally?”
Garry said that becoming more than an observer to the treaty would strengthen the U.S.’s position on foreign policy, and English cited the “business of double standards” in which the U.S. has historically engaged — “one of the weaker parts of our hand,” he acknowledged.
“[Signing the statute] would signal to the world that we’re actually putting action behind our stated policy of being supportive of accountability and justice for international crimes like genocide — and that we’re willing ourselves to be held accountable where any of our nationals would perpetrate such crimes,” Garry said.

Unlike the decline in the number of humanities and English majors over the past decade at institutions such as Arizona State University and Harvard University reported by The New Yorker, USC’s humanities and English majors have remained constant in the last few years. 
USC awarded around 325 undergraduate degrees in humanities and English between July 2010 and June 2011, representing 6.6% of degrees conferred. This figure dropped to 5% between July 2018 and June 2019. However, from July 2018 to June 2021, the figure has been consistent at 5%, stagnating the decline. 
One of the factors that may be contributing to the decline in English and humanities majors is that students interested in these fields are more passionate about other fields, and hence opt for those as their majors, said David St. John, English department chair. This increased interest in other fields is supported by the increase in STEM majors, from 18.5% of all undergraduate degrees between July 2010 and June 2011 to 26% between July 2020 and June 2021. A few of the best students in his creative writing classes were STEM students with a passion for poetry, fiction and nonfiction, St. John said. 
“If they don’t choose [English], it’s because they are also equally gifted in something else,” he said. 
Thematic Option is a program offered by the University to 200 freshmen with the opportunity to question the work of influential philosophers and writers while satisfying their general education requirements. This is often an option for students who wish to explore the humanities without the commitment of declaring a major.
Manas Garg, a freshman majoring in computer science and business administration, said he chose Thematic Option because, despite being interested in philosophy and literature, he found it difficult to minor or double major in these fields because of his already heavy course load.
“I genuinely feel more inclined towards tech and business than I am interested in philosophy,” Garg said. “It has better future opportunities than literature and philosophy on a large scale.”
Srishti Sunder, a freshman majoring in economics and math, switched out of the law, history and culture major to a STEM major because of this. 
“If I did law, history and culture, there were really very limited career opportunities and very limited income opportunities,” Sunder said. “I’d have to do a masters in law … with only an undergraduate, I could work administratively in a law office, but wouldn’t be able to do anything to further help any case.”
However, Emma Garcia, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, doesn’t believe there are limited career opportunities in the humanities. She continues to pursue this major because she sees a future. 
“Everything we consume in our daily life comes from humanities, arts and literature,” Garcia said. “You can go into law, politics and social work. There are plenty of things you can do with a degree in the humanities.”
Juan Corona, a freshman majoring in American studies and ethnicity, said they are often ridiculed for pursuing a humanities degree. 
“It’s something that’s unfair: Being in the humanities and often being perceived as a joke,” Corona said. “I am still going to earn just as valid a degree.” 
Garcia said there is a huge emphasis on majoring in STEM because of the technological developments that have been taking place recently. 
“Our society puts a lot of emphasis on studying STEM and science as opposed to the humanities or liberal arts,” Garcia said.
STEM companies don’t recruit engineering majors exclusively, St. John said; he has come across students who are English majors who have been recruited by banks, technology companies and startups.
“Your skills as writers and your skills at being able to articulate ideas make you valuable to not just advertising companies or a speech writer at a political office,” St. John said. “Every industry, every organization, relies on having someone who can really communicate … they need to be able to articulate and embody whatever the vision is of that place.”
Contrary to national trends, English majors at USC have stayed stable at approximately 1% of the class from 2017 to 2021. St. John attributed this to USC’s English curriculum, which has three different tracks — critical track, creative writing and narrative studies — and allows the department to adapt to the shifting interests of students, along with the diverse and exceptional quality of the faculty.

Syringe exchange among the unhoused population has been a growing public health concern nationally since the 1980s. However, this issue becomes even more pressing in Los Angeles, where the nation’s largest unhoused population resides. 
Within these populations, the availability of clean needles is essential for preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. Fortunately, syringe exchange programs — also known as syringe service programs — give individuals access to sterile needles, help facilitate safe disposal of used syringes and provide other mental and physical health resources. Despite these benefits, many argue that SEPs promote drug use and addiction rather than reducing the spread of infectious diseases and death.
The reality is the complete opposite.
Through providing clean needles, these programs greatly reduce transmission of blood-borne diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, SEPs are associated with an approximately 50% reduction in HIV and HCV incidence. 
These programs don’t just hand out syringes, they provide proper education of overdose and infections and opportunities for individuals experiencing homelessness to connect with resources for drug treatment, social services and medical care. The CDC reports that new users of SEPs are five times more likely to enter drug treatment, and that daily users are three times more likely to reduce drug use compared to individuals who are not in the programs.
Another matter of contention regarding SEPs is that they can have a large impact on the safety of communities and neighborhoods in which they operate. However, the National Institute of Drug Abuse found in a 2012 NIDA-funded study, researchers found 86% fewer used syringes littered on the streets of communities with SEPs in place. With cleaner streets, children and adults who reside within these communities would be safer due to fewer risks of needlestick injuries and illness. 
The need for SEPs throughout L.A. County is more critical now than ever, as homelessness is on the rise and has been found to be associated with an increase in drug injecting behavior. The crisis is further exacerbated by many emerging issues, including antibiotic resistant bacteria, infectious disease and drug addiction. Addressing these issues and pushing SEPs forward will improve population health in communities and, on a larger scale, decrease unnecessary funding of hospitalization and HCV healthcare services that lead to annual expenses in the billions. 
The root of the controversy behind SEPs all boils down to the idea of prevention versus treatment. When we take a look at various health behaviors, prevention is not as feasible as people may think. To quit a drug addiction with a snap of a finger is almost impossible, and the reason is quite simple: Health behavior is not simply black and white. In this case, the health behavior of drug injection can lead to disease, overdose and more. Therefore, to somehow eradicate drug injection, one would have to target each of all of these effects. 
In most cases, it may seem as if those struggling with drug use are the cause of their own problems, a clear example of the “Us/Them” phenomenon at play. It is easy for us to overlook the mere fact that those classified as “Them,” drug injection users, are human beings like the rest of “Us.” Many times, drug users are looking for help, but they do not have the ability. With the stigma in place, other factors such as low awareness of helpful resources, lack of treatment facilities and financial barriers only make seeking help more of a burden. 
Rather than despising what the streets of L.A. have come to be, neglecting those who are unhoused at no fault of their own and ignoring effective solutions that tackle the root of the SEP, it is time we recognize the importance of the systematic approach SEPs have taken and its success. Whether we actively work to fulfill the goals of the program or be further conscientious of this drug issue that may surround our daily lives, it is time we prioritize the health and dignity of all individuals and support these programs as a vital part of this effort.

I never believed in love stories. Even the classics — Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty — felt unrealistic to a fault. They rubbed me the wrong way, and while 5-year-old Helen still adored these stories, she focused on the music that lifted her body onto her feet and the pictures that danced across the screen. Not the “love.”
I also didn’t get the concept of “true love’s kiss,” as it seemed a bit weird that a random guy would just kiss a girl passed out in the middle of the forest. I didn’t get the concept of revolving your life around a man who only showed up for five minutes toward the movie’s ending. But most of all, I didn’t get how relationships like these worked because it was nothing like what I grew up with. So, when 19-year-old Cinderella got married after a dude came to her house to return her slipper, I knew it was just a fantasy. 
My parent’s “love story” is that of many immigrants. Fleeing from the chaos and brutality of the việt cộng and the horrid conditions that were left behind after the Vietnam War, my mom’s family did whatever they could to escape and come to the United States. On the other hand, my dad had fought in the war, was granted refugee status in the U.S. and lived here for a decade before coming back to Vietnam to marry my mom. 
While arranged marriages were outlawed in 1959, my parents’ matrimony was a forced result of their circumstances. Marriage was like a signed contract with terms and conditions that granted my mom freedom and my dad a good sum of money, but as he was friends with my mom’s brother, he considered it a favor. 
So growing up, I saw marriage as transactional — a method for asylum where immigration came first, and love came after. If you were lucky.  
While the definition of marriage varies globally, family is a fundamental institution that permeates nearly every society. It has the ability to disseminate social norms, language, beliefs and customs through filial generations and provides a way to escape loneliness. So, understanding the value of marriage hasn’t been an issue. I’m not sure why my parents stayed together but I know fighting life alongside someone is much easier than fighting alone, especially in a foreign country.
I recognize the impact of my parents’ relationships on my perception of love, relationships and marriage and the psychological scars it left. But when I hear that my classmates who are about the same age as me are getting married, my mind goes blank with only one thing written in bold in my brain: Why?
While I understand that getting married in college is not uncommon (with roughly 20% of young adults getting married when they’re 20-24), I grew up believing that marriage was something you either needed to survive orr, something that came later down the line once you’re successful and with someone who you won’t threaten to divorce in front of your kids. 
Whether that’s with “Love is Blind” or “90 Day Fiancé,” the fascination of marriage and relationships in media often leaves me puzzled. It was “Cinderella” when I was five, and now it’s “Bridgerton” as I am 22. Don’t get me wrong; I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the third season of “Bridgerton” to drop, but seeing kids my age and even younger getting matched off for marriage on my screen does leave me irrationally thinking, “Should I be getting married soon?” While I absolutely yearn for the electrifying sexual tension between Kate Sharma and Anthony Bridgerton, I’m okay with being an Eloise. 
I am an adamant believer that people should be able to do whatever the hell they want as long as it doesn’t impact others’ lives. However, while I’m currently in a happy, committed relationship, I look at my parents’ marital situation and find it incredibly unrealistic to imagine those my age getting married.
Some of my friends have their entire weddings mapped out already or are already discussing a five-year plan with their partners. While there’s nothing wrong with that, I wonder why our mind jumps to marriage when we think about our future. In the 21st century, marriage should be the least of their concerns — especially when I know they learned how to do laundry freshman year of college and forget to drink water on a daily basis.
While marriage was just another item on my parents’ to-do list, it isn’t for the vast majority of us. So, instead of planning wedding cakes, just grab a slice from Dulce and pass our classes before worrying about our “happily ever after” with someone. You might not even need it.

Content warning: This article contains discussions of sexual assault.
Kian Abrishami will never forget the night he prevented his friend from being sexually assaulted at a USC party.
“I saw a friend getting pulled to a couch when it was obvious that she wasn’t interested in being romantic with this guy,” said Abrishami, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and computer science. “I intervened — but if that was behind closed doors or if that friend was alone, things could have escalated. It became very clear then that a lot of vulnerable students don’t have a way out.”
From that moment, Abrishami said he made it his mission to create an immediate way for students to discreetly notify their friends when they are in danger. 
He partnered with Grace Miedziak, the director of advocacy at the Survivor Support Community at USC, to develop Brave — a startup developing bracelets to prevent sexual assault on college campuses, coined “Bravebands.” 
Since its incorporation March 20, the pair have onboarded a team of 15 staff members, with Abrishami as chief executive officer and Miedziak as chief operating officer.
“The Braveband serves as a shortcut and direct lifeline to your friends so that users are only two bracelet taps away from notifying their entire friend group that they need help,” said Miedziak, a junior majoring in composition. “The user would not need to use their phones at all unless they would like to cancel a signal.”
Throughout April, which is also Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Brave plans to launch a full beta test of its app to be used in conjunction with the bracelet, which will send a user’s exact location to their friends’ phones. The bracelets will eventually be able to communicate independently of phone access, addressing any concerns surrounding the perpetrator taking a user’s phone away.
“Once we get enough feedback on this beta technology that we’ve developed, then we’ll tie that in with a bracelet,” Miedziak said. “Instead of going on your phone, you’re going to actually discreetly tap it and then it’ll have that vibration haptic that’ll instantly get people’s attention.” 
The startup has amassed over 200 student beta testers in college campuses across the country such as the University of Rochester, Lehigh and Northeastern, and is looking to expand beta testing opportunities — specifically to student organizations at USC. Brave plans to update the app with a heat map, which will keep track of where alerts are sent and the frequency during which these alerts are sent. 
“A lot of students agree that universities aren’t doing enough to prevent sexual assault on their campuses,” Miedziak said. “I really strongly believe in finding something now that can help now versus waiting for universities to do something.”
As Brave collects and analyzes data as well as user feedback on the app interface, they can reaffirm the brand’s viability to possible partner educational institutions. Brave currently is working with Princeton University’s Title IX Office. Princeton gave Brave a checklist of goals as well as requirements on market validation data. They need independent research done, and Brave will provide that information following their pre-sales.
Brave’s ultimate goal is to work with multiple universities to offer the Braveband at zero cost to incoming freshmen as a welcome gift package, Miedziak said. At the time of publication, USC has not responded to Brave’s partnership offer. 
Presale for the Braveband began late March. Brave has 15 hardware bracelet prototypes that they are coding. Abrishami estimates that the total manufacturing is $15 per unit. Brave will sell each Braveband for $30. 
The company is also working on partnerships with brands such as Lululemon and Madhappy to help design the bracelets to make them fashionable and discreet. Taylor Vangrin, a junior majoring in business administration and director of social media marketing at Brave, has used social media to contact these companies and release promotional material.
“The power of our product is just visually like when you see it, believe in it,” Vangrin said. “Now it’s one of those things that I think emotionally connects to a lot of people. We have promotional videos in that we filmed scenarios with the product in action. I find those leave the most powerful messaging.”
The Braveband was displayed to potential investors at USC TroyLabs’ DEMO 2023 Entrepreneurship Conference April 5. 
“For me in particular this is a chance to sleep at night knowing that the work that we do is keeping people safe and preventing sexual assault,” Abrishami said. “That’s what I realize is the most important virtue that any entrepreneurship or entrepreneur should have: empathy. Empathy for the people that you work with, and most importantly, empathy for the people who you’re trying to help and serve.”
