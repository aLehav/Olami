The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary for Monday, Oct. 1. 
Crimes against a person
at 10:59 a.m. on Oct. 1, a student reported that an acquaintance continued to contact her in person, by phone and email after being asked not to do so. DPS officers advised the student to document the incidents and instructed her how to file a restraining order against the subject.
 
Crimes against property
At 12:07 P.m. on Oct. 1, a student reported her skateboard missing from Elizabeth VonKleinsmid Memorial Hall.
at 9:08 a.m. on Oct. 1, a suspect entered an unsecured studio at the Ray and Nadine Watt Hall of Architecture and Fine Arts, and removed an unattended cellular phone and currency from a wallet.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 8:55 p.m. on Oct.1, a non-USC female reported that she purchased what she believed to be two laptop computers from a suspect who approached her in the parking lot at Superior Market.  The suspect then fled on a bicycle. When the female opened the computer boxes, she discovered that they contained only old phone books.
At 1:40 P.m. on Oct. 1, DPS officers responded to a staff member who suffered a seizure at the Keck Hospital of USC.  A Rapid Response team was examining the staff member when the officers arrived, and she was subsequently released at the scene.
At 12:49 P.m. on Oct. 1, a staff member reported that she observed an elderly patient’s caregiver physically abuse the patient at the Eileen and Kenneth T. Norris Dental Science Center. Both parties left the premises prior to the report and DPS officers subsequently notified the Elderly Abuse hotline of the incident.
At 11:14 A.m. on Oct. 1, the property manager at 1197 36th St. reported that a student became irate during a dispute about a security deposit and threatened to vandalize his vehicle.  The student was not available for questioning at the time of the report.
at 9:15 A.m. on Oct. 1, DPS officers responded to a student who was feeling faint and had suffered a temporary loss of vision at Ralph and Goldy Lewis Hall.  A Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance Unit was requested and Unit #34 responded.  The RA Unit examined the student then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
Who buys laptops in the Superior Market parking lot from a guy on a bicycle?  Maybe you should stop payment on the check?

Undergraduate Student Government postponed a vote to provide funding to host a panel of Olympic athletes during Homecoming Weekend at its meeting Tuesday. USG will vote on this funding request at its next meeting.
Motion · Vicken Antounian, a commuter senator, speaks during a USG Senate meeting about funding a panel of Olympians during homecoming week. The Senate moved to postpone a vote until its meeting next Tuesday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The panel event, expected to consist of 10 to 12 current and former USC athletes who competed in the 2012 Olympics in London, is estimated to cost $3,884. This includes the cost for the venue, parking and gifts for the Olympians and posters and other advertisement leading up to the event.
Some USG senators are hesitant about the cost of the event, which would eliminate almost a third of the Senate’s yearly budget. USG has the option of partially funding the panel and paying solely for the venue, Bovard Auditorium.
Trojan Pride and the Alumni Affairs committee requested USG funding for this event because they believe it will benefit the student body and bolster athletic pride on campus.
“USC is unique in the fact that we’re so successful in athletics and that we’ve had a better Olympic record than some countries,” said Trojan Pride Director Amanda Schmitt, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “I think the panel will be a way to piggyback off of the hype of the [Olympic] games and bring it back to campus.”
The event would coincide with the athletic department formally recognizing the Olympians at the homecoming football game against Arizona State University.
The panel discussion would be free to all students on a first-come, first-serve basis and conclude with a question and answer session for students to engage with the athletes.
Trojan Pride and the Alumni Affairs committee are also working with the athletic department to incorporate a performance by the Spirit of Troy marching band and to have Los Angeles City Council members attend.
The list of Olympic athletes is still being finalized.

In the last year, Tara D. Sonenshine, under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, has traveled around the world to places ranging from Pakistan to China. Sonenshine, however, was not traveling for leisure purposes.
State affairs · Tara D. Sonenshine, under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, discusses U.S. policies at home and abroad. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
During her time abroad, the biggest challenge Sonenshine faced with her job was defining it, she said Tuesday during a Center for Public Diplomacy event at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
“My challenge has been to explain what public diplomacy is to three different groups,” Sonenshine said.
She said the three groups are her colleagues, her fellow Americans and those overseas.
“Finally, I’m in an audience where people understand my title,” she said.
The room was full of people — sitting on the ground, squashed together on benches and crowded in the back.
Aleksandra Ristovic, a graduate student studying public diplomacy, credited the high-turnout to the fact that Sonenshine is “sort of our [public diplomacy] goddess.”
“She could have chosen any school to do this in,” Ristovic said.
After applauding the USC crowd for knowing what her job title meant, Sonenshine went on to discuss how she explains public diplomacy to those who did not know.
“When we speak to one another, engage to one another, etc., we’re engaging in public diplomacy,” she said.
Sonenshine said that the term applies to everything, ranging from a Russian athlete talking to a U.S. physical education expert to countering violent extremism.
She also emphasized the importance of each individual in the field.
“If you don’t take people into account when making policy, then you’re flying alone,” Sonenshine said.
After her discussion, Sonenshine opened the event to questions from the audience that ranged from the effect of social media to nuclear power in Iran.
In response to one question, Sonenshine said contradictions between freedom of expression and religion will always exist.
“I have accepted the puzzle pieces don’t always fit together,” Sonenshine said.
On one of her trips, Sonenshine said she visited an all-girls school in Afghanistan. When taking questions from the students, Sonenshine described the USC students as “tame” in comparison.
When asked about scientific diplomacy, she told a story about how when she was in China she was discussing breast cancer. Through diplomacy, according to Sonenshine, countries communicate scientific knowledge to help one another.
“Breast cancer doesn’t care what religion you are or about your ideas,” she said. “It invades your brain.”
Near the end of the talk, a member of the audience asked Sonenshine how she would define success.
“You will not see it immediately, you might not see it in a week, and you might not see it in a year,” Sonenshine said. “It’s in [the] long-term where you’ll see it.”
Sonenshine wasn’t always involved in public diplomacy. In fact, she has experience in a wide variety of careers. She won 10 Emmy Awards for broadcast journalism and is the former vice president of the United States Institute of Peace.
Annenberg Dean Ernest James Wilson III described Sonenshine as an example of excellence across a variety of roles.
“Her 10 Emmys underscore her ability to move into different careers,” Wilson said. “She is an example about flexibility you can have in your own life.”
Ultimately, Sonenshine advised students to follow their passion.
“Communication is a tapestry that has lots of threads,” Sonenshine said. “Some threads come from working in Washington. Some threads come from traveling abroad and working in the field. Some come from the commercial world and some come from your own life experience.”
Jennifer Green, a graduate student studying public diplomacy, said she met Sonenshine in Washington, D.C. as part of a delegation of students and was really excited to have the opportunity to see the under secretary speak at USC.
“She came at a really fascinating time in light of the video that recently came up from the middle east,” Green said.
The video, Innocence of Muslims, is an American-made anti-Islam film that incited violence in Libya, Egypt and Pakistan, among other countries, last month.
To demonstrate the impact of social media, Sonenshine shared powerful statistics with the audience.
“Every second, one hour of video is uploaded to YouTube. Every two hours the total becomes nine months of video,” Sonenshine said. “Every 10 days an entire century is uploaded.”

For nearly two decades, supermarkets have sold genetically engineered food. But many consumers, however, are not aware that the foods they are purchasing are either genetically engineered or modified.
This November, however, a proposition on the state ballot seeks to change that. Proposition 37 would require all genetically modified raw or processed food to be labeled and would prevent any such altered food from being labeled as “natural.”
The ballot measure does not place a ban on the manufacture or sale of GE food, and it exempts foods that are certified organic, alcoholic, served in restaurants or for immediate consumption or made from animals fed with genetically engineered material.
Opponents of Prop. 37 argue that if the measure imposes extra financial strain on manufacturers, either through relabeling cost or through litigation suits, the extra costs would be passed on to the consumers in the form of increased food prices.
Lauren Pacheco, a senior majoring in communication, said she believes labeling will not make much of a difference in the amount of GE food that is purchased.
“I eat genetically engineered foods all the time, the corn and the chicken and all that, not on purpose though,” Pacheco said. “I think even with packaging, if it’s cheaper people will still buy it.”
According to the California Official Voter Information Guide, 88 percent of corn and 94 percent of soybeans produced in the United States are genetically engineered, as well as much of the country’s zucchini, canola, cotton, alfalfa, papaya and sugar beet supply.
David Lightsey, a physiologist and consumer advocate with the National Council Against Health Fraud, said the measure reflects uncertainty surrounding genetically modified profucts in the United States.
“All the other developing countries are relying on the GE technology … we have used these things in Mexico, India, China and Pakistan for some time,” Lightsey said. “It’s much easier to ship a genetically modified seed than pesticides, which are more expensive and much more difficult.”
Feeding a large population is another factor, Lightsey said.
“The real issue here is can we feed the enormous number of people that we’re facing?” Lightsey said. “On a campus, people are not going to realize that we have over 7 billion people to feed now. In the U.S. alone, we have roughly 314 million.”
Supporters of Prop. 37 believe that consumers should know the contents of products before purchasing them. “Right to Know,” a campaign backing the initiative, also said that genetically modified foods can cause environmental damage and might have an impact on consumer health.
Callahan Jacobs, a senior majoring in biology and kinesiology, said she tends to be wary of these foods.
“Based on the research they’ve done, [GE food] is definitely something they need to be monitoring,” Jacobs said. “We need more regulations and limitations on genetically modified food, especially for fast food places.”
Some students said the labeling that Prop. 37 requires could help more people become aware of what they are eating.
“I think they should be labeled so it would turn people away from eating such unhealthy foods,” said David Alvarez, a senior majoring in narrative studies.
In an age when farmers are feeding arsenic to chickens, I am amazed that people oppose Prop 37. For those who do, I invite you to eat a conventional tortilla chip. The GMO corn that was used to produce the chip was sprayed with Roundup. The corn chip was then fried in GMO soy oil. The soy was doused in the herbicide Roundup and the oil was extracted using the toxin hexane. Would you feed this to your family? I have studied the GMO issue very carefully. In fact, I eat 100% organic now to avoid insecticides, herbicides, GMOs, and hexane extracted oils. In addition to GMO labeling, I sincerely hope that it will soon be mandated that food manufacturers must list everything toxic that is sprayed on crops or fed to animals. If you feed chickens arsenic, that is an ingredient. It should be listed. If you douse your soy with Roundup, that’s an ingredient. List it. People value their health and they want to know what is in their food. Prop 37 should pass.
If anyone has any doubts about the potential long term consequences of GMOs, check out the following link:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njd0RugGjAg&feature=player_embedded
Most people believe that genetically engineered foods 1). will help feed the world and 2). are cheaper.  Both are myths perpetuated by the biotech industry to gain public acceptance of GMOs.   But according to a study commissioned by the World Bank that involved 400 scientists in 58 countries, Genetically engineered crops are unsustainable.  A recently published peer reviewed study in Food and Chemical Toxicology – the first long term study of its kind on GMOs – revealed that rats that ate a diet of genetically modified BT corn suffered severe kidney and liver disease, and severe breast inflammation.   Why are there no credible studies here in the U.S.?  Because Monsanto refuses to grant researchers permission to use its patented GE seeds, while buying the silence of politicians of both political parties and implanting Michael Taylor, Monsanto’s former vice president, as deputy director of the FDA in charge of safety and labeling.   Cheaper?  Eat cheap now but pay later.  Who knows what diseases will impair people over the long term who consume GMOs.  Why take a chance with genetic roulette?  
Do GMOs have any advantages at all?  Yes, just one:  to make money for Monsanto.

USC scientists unveiled a newly discovered drug to treat ovarian cancer on Sept. 17 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the university announced Tuesday.
The drug is expected to decrease the number of doses a patient must take and make medicine more effective for patients whose cancer has developed a drug resistance.
The drug is a member of a class of cytotoxic agents known as PACMA. Graduate student Alexey N. Butkevich, a co-author of the study, synthesized more than 80 newly created compounds in the lab with co-author Nicos A. Petasis, a professor of chemistry at the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. Additional co-authors of the study included Nouri Neamati, a professor of pharmacology and pharmaceutical sciences at the USC School of Pharmacy, Roppei Yamada, Yu Zhou, Bikash Debnath and Professors Roger Duncan and Ebrahim Zandi.
[Correction: A previous version of this story did not state that Nicos A. Petasis, professor of chemistry, is a lead researcher of this study along with Neamati. A previous version of this story also incorrectly stated that Butkevich worked in Neamati’s lab.]
The researchers eventually found that PACMA31 was highly toxic to ovarian cancer.
PACMA31 interrupts the folding process that shapes proteins and allows them to function properly. The build-up of these incorrectly folded proteins places stress on the cells and eventually causes them to die.
As this strategy is different than that of the two leading drugs in the treatment of ovarian cancer, PACMA31 provides new hope for patients who do not respond to the usual treatments of paclitaxel and cisplatin.
[Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that antibiotics are typically used to treat ovarian cancer.]
Though the drug has not been tested on humans yet, Neamati said that PACMA31 could change the future of cancer treatment.
“When the patient has no other choice, we could potentially treat them with our drug,” Neamati said in a statement.
PACMA31 accumulates within cancer cells, meaning it is less likely than other drugs to cause detrimental side effects in normal tissues. Once PACMA31 latches onto its mark, it stays there permanently until the protein has been degraded.
Prior to its unveiling, the drug was tested in the lab on ovarian cancer cells and mice tumors, where it was determined to be nontoxic and successful at halting tumor growth.
Shili Xu, a graduate student who worked on the project, described the drug’s relevance to medicine in the press release.
“We need a new generation of drugs,” Xu said. “We need to overcome the drug-resistance issue.”
It is certainly not ‘approved’. 
It’s not even entered Phase I clinical trials yet.
While promising, it should really be taken with a pinch of salt.

Cardinal and gold streamers burst into the air as President C. L. Max Nikias presented a $1.5 million check Tuesday afternoon to USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign, an initiative to raise funding for community outreach from faculty and staff.
The check, which will benefit 42 programs, represents the funds yielded from last year’s campaign. It was presented to community partners during the kickoff event for this year’s campaign at Alumni Park.
Fundraising · President C. L. Max Nikias and administrators present a $1.5 million check to community partners during this year’s Good Neighbors Campaign kickoff event Tuesday. – Daniel Rothberg | Daily Trojan
Nikias announced a fundraising goal of $1.6 million for this year’s campaign, which will last through the month of October. The GNC benefits programs aimed at supporting and improving education, safety and health programs in the local community.
During his remarks, Nikias applauded the program, founded in 1993, for making lasting differences through funding education programs.
“When you read a child a book, he will learn for a day. But if you teach a child to read, he will learn for a lifetime,” Nikias said to an audience of students, university employees and community partners. “Programs like this not only help members of our community reach milestones, but also reach their full potential.”
Daniel Zavala, a GNC manager for the USC Radisson, encourages employees, friends and guests to participate in the initiative. Zavala said the program yields positive benefits for the community.
“It’s a great opportunity to meet student organizations and after school programs around the neighborhood,” Zavala said.
Nikias said though only 40 percent of faculty and staff made a donation last year, he urged greater participation from employees. The $1.6 million goal would be reached if every full-time employee at USC donated $2 a week, Nikias said.
“I ask you to ask yourself the following,” Nikias said. “Will I help a child to become the first in her family to attend college? Will I help and reach members of our communities through greater exposure to the arts? Will I help families learn more about wellness so they can lead more healthy lives? And will I help ensure the streets of our neighborhoods remains safe for our residents?”
Since 1994, GNC has raised more than $14 million. Thomas Sayles, senior vice president for university relations, said the program is unique to USC.
“When I talk to other university leaders they say, ‘Oh, it’s a wonderful program, we should do it.’ But they never do,” Sayles said. “I guess they just don’t have the Trojan spirit to really get it done.”

No. 13 USC’s Thursday night game against Utah is approaching quickly, and the Trojans are thinking about the atmosphere in Salt Lake City.
Familiar foe · Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and the Trojans beat Utah 23-14 in 2011. The game was decided on a last-second blocked field goal. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“We talk about weathering the storm when you go on the road any time, especially if it’s a Thursday night game in an environment like it’ll be,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “[Utah] is going to make some plays. It’s going to happen.”
The Trojans are coming off a bye week, and it was after their bye week last season when the team seemed to click against Cal. This season, USC says the week off helped it in multiple cases.
“We’re in the best physical shape that we’ve been all year long,” Kiffin said. “It allowed us to clean up some things in all three phases of the game. It was good for our players to get away, from everyday being around [the coaches].”
USC will be facing a Utah offense that has had a very slow start to the season. The Utes rank last in the Pac-12 with less than 300 yards of offense per game.
—
Though USC’s pass rush has been impressive thus far, there have been holes in the secondary. But one defensive back has stood out in practice lately.
“[Freshman cornerback] Kevon Seymour played really well,” Kiffin said. “As we go throughout the season, we’ll look to expand his role at some point. It’s good to have a young corner like that.”
The Trojans will face a tough test against Utah’s defense, led by their interior defensive lineman Star Lotulelei, expected to be a top-10 selection in next April’s NFL draft.
“He can make so many plays. The penetration is such an issue, even if he’s not making a play, he’s making running backs bounce on runs and the quarterback move around,” Kiffin said.
A potential key matchup in the game will be Lotelelei against senior center Khaled Holmes. But Kiffin simply said he hopes Holmes plays, and he didn’t provide an update to Khaled’s injury status.
USC’s running game has been significantly better with Holmes on the field, so his status for the game figures to be pivotal.

Stop me if you’ve heard this before: USC students need to be better fans of sports other than football. Students need to go and support the other perennial national powers in the USC athletic department like water polo and volleyball. Trojan pride should be for more than just football and all that jazz.
It’s the shame schtick every year, and much to the chagrin of the school’s marketing department, little appears to change. This year, though, there is a tangible possibility it might.
The newly launched Pac-12 Networks, despite all its criticism and frustration over ongoing negotiations with DirecTV, is providing Pac-12 and USC fans with previously inconceivable viewing opportunities for the so-called “non-revenue sports,” aka everything except football.
Now, I think most everyone on this campus is excited for the return of Trojan football on Thursday. It’s been a much-needed rest for the team and its fans. It was oddly relaxing to not have a football game to plan the entire weekend around.
And with the return to the gridiron in Salt Lake City, USC students will have another football-free weekend to plan. But that doesn’t mean it has to be a Trojan-free weekend.
The USC women’s soccer team will be taking on Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore., at 1 p.m. Previously, that would have meant nothing. If you were at all interested in what happened, you could have looked up the score online later. Now, if you’re interested or just want to enjoy a lazy Friday afternoon, the game will be aired live on the Pac-12 Network.
Already, USC soccer has been featured five times on the Pac-12 Network, including its two most recent road games in Arizona. Counting their game against the Beavers on Friday, the Women of Troy will be featured on live television four more times over the course of the year, including their final road game in Pullman, Wash. on Oct. 12.
Then, of course, there’s the top-ranked, undefeated, four-time defending national champion men’s water polo squad, which takes on No. 3 archrival Stanford in Palo Alto at 9 a.m. on Saturday live on the Pac-12 Network. In their last matchup, shown live on ESPNU, the Trojans yielded the Cardinal a late equalizer before winning in overtime.
Now, nine in the morning is quite early. And water polo isn’t necessarily the most television-conducive sport. So if you’re actually looking to go somewhere, might I suggest women’s volleyball against Arizona State on Sunday evening (the Women of Troy also play Friday night against Arizona, but I’m just going to assume that isn’t too high on people’s Friday priority lists)?
Now, for you volleyball skeptics out there, hear me out. I was once one of you. I thought volleyball was stagnant and repetitive and, on the whole, not very exciting. And I still don’t understand the strategy of the game on even the most elementary level (tall people in front, that’s all I got), but let me tell you, volleyball is legit. The authority with which a ball is “killed,” or how crazy the libero seems diving all around the hardwood court, cannot be appreciated on television.
But if, perhaps, you live on Menlo and the Galen Center is a little too far of a trek for you … you guessed it. Watch it live on the Pac-12 Network from the comfort of your own couch.
Fans should take advantage of the newfound exposure being provided to the other sports and give them a fair look. No, the soccer won’t look like Barcelona, try as coach Ali Khosroshahin might. But the “beautiful game” still is just that. And I know that there are plenty of volleyball players and fans in Southern California who will appreciate the game played on the level it is in the Pac-12.
So even if you don’t feel like making it out to Galen or McAlister Field anytime soon, you can still catch the Trojans on TV. Football might be the most fun sport at USC, but it certainly isn’t the only one.
 
“Any Given Saturday” runs every other Wednesday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Nick at burtonn@usc.edu.
Living on Menlo and Galen Center is too far? That should hardly be an excuse. I go to every volleyball game that I can assuming I do not have some other required event that I have to attend; it’s just a mere 10 minute bike ride away.
[…] Other USC sports are thriving in anonymity | Daily Trojan […]

Senior forward Samantha Johnson recorded the fastest goal in the history of USC’s women’s soccer program, scoring just 14 seconds into a game last fall against Washington State.
This season, freshman forward Katie Johnson, not related, has provided similarly explosive plays, using her vision in the penalty box to score three goals for the Women of Troy this season, including two in six minutes against No. 19 Portland on Sept. 16.
“They have a lot of similarities to their game,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “[Samantha] and Katie started clicking right away. Now they’re actually developing a good understanding of each other. Once they get a few games under their belt, you’re going to see some really neat things come from the two of them.”
The elder Johnson has already provided her fair share of heroics this season with two game-winning goals in the last 15 seconds of matches against San Diego and Washington.
“Most of the time I’m just kind of in the right place at the right time,” Samantha Johnson said. “It’s just about trying to use technique that [the coaches] taught me.”
The younger Johnson said she looks up to her elder.
“As a senior, she scores the clutch goals,” Katie Johnson said. “We trust her because she does the right things on the ball.”
Katie said Samantha, who’s totaled four goals this season, is a good mentor on the pitch for the 16 freshmen on the squad, helpsing adjust to the college game. That’s a luxury previous USC teams didn’t enjoy, according to Samantha.
When the older Johnson was a freshman, some of the upperclassmen on the squad had been on the 2007 team that won the NCAA title. One might expect that championship experience would rub off on the younger girls and bring the team closer together — but Johnson says it did the opposite.
“There was a big disconnect between the lowerclassmen and the upperclassmen,” Samantha Johnson said. “We didn’t have great leadership, so to speak …  They were intimidating and never let their guard down. That’s why I make a conscience effort to help the younger players now.”
The younger Johnson noted the the leadership as well.
“Sam’s a natural leader,” Katie Johnson said. “She tells me where to be, how to stay connected. She’s really good at seeing the field and seeing the plays develop, and she’s helping me see that as well.”
The Johnsons came to USC with notable local pedigrees; both went to high school relatively near USC — Samantha in Palmdale, Katie in La Cañada — both were named All-Americans in high school and both achieved All-League status three times.
The pair also had to deal with injury issues coming into this season- Katie had to recover from a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered during her senior year in high school, while Samantha has been bothered by a persistent foot injury.
Khosroshahin didn’t initially think USC would have a Johnson and Johnson duo up front, since Samantha had mostly played at midfield at USC. But when she was switched to forward in a game against Cal State Northridge to minimize the stress on her foot, and ended up scoring the game-tying goal, Khosroshahin knew he had found something good.
“We only got to see glimpses of the two of them together, but we liked what we saw,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s been a treat to watch Sam’s play really improve, and to see her lead the group on the field has been a lot of fun.”
And since both are still working back to full speed, Khosroshahin thinks the best is yet to come for both players.
“I always say something special happens to kids in their senior year, with that finality of things,” Khosroshahin said. “It has a way of helping you focus a little bit more.”
Samantha Johnson seems focused on carving out a senior legacy of last-second comebacks — and Khosroshahin hints that Katie might have a comparable future.
“[Katie] is barely starting to find her rhythm and her touch right now,” Khosroshahin said. “I’m not real good at fortune telling, but I think if [Katie] continues to become a student of the game, and puts the time in, she definitely has the potential of doing some very special things here.”
If the younger Johnson keeps learning from the examples the older Johnson has set for her this season, those special things could happen sooner rather than later.

Despite the seemingly basic title of his new Comedy Central special Demetri Martin. Standup Comedian., Demetri Martin is anything but one-dimensional.
Most will recognize the 39-year-old comedian for his biting one-liners (“Saying, ‘I’m sorry’ is the same as saying, ‘I apologize.’ Except at a funeral”), which he underscores with pleasant plucks from his guitar. Others might remember the observational “visual aids” he uses, such as the large pad to explore the paradoxes of sitting in chairs.
In our digital age, standup comedians are readily available commodities. Even talented ones are easy to come by. But with his new special, which premiered last Saturday on Comedy Central, Martin continues to prove his unique comedy techniques are as razor-sharp and cunning as ever.
Martin, who finds inspiration in everything from daydreaming and music to people watching at coffee shops, said his success comes from basing his routine on simple jokes and one-liners rather than long, drawn-out personal stories.
“My material is simple and relatable enough,” Martin said. “Kids come up to me and they tell me they like my stuff, and someone who’s like 60 also might like the jokes. They’re just basic ideas about the human condition.”
Standup Comedian is no different.
In the one-hour special, Martin doesn’t set out to offend or make sweeping remarks about any particular group. Instead, he artfully showcases his punch line prowess and innovative tactics that are guaranteed to receive laughs every time. Filmed at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, Standup Comedian features Martin playing up his established tricks brilliantly and delivering pithy remarks accompanied by his music (“It’s cool when an ex-girlfriend becomes an XL-girlfriend,” he says).
Martin even tackles new visual media like his ridiculous yet hilariously handwritten fliers — “Free tiny strips of paper!” one cleverly says — which he posted on coffee shop bulletin boards to generate a reaction.
He even shows off his physical comedy chops by demonstrating the absurdity of mechanized responses in public restrooms: “The automatic paper towel dispenser is a solution to something that was never a problem.”
Standup Comedian marks Martin’s first cable special since his Comedy Central Presents show back in 2004. When asked what he learned from his experience creating a televised special nearly six years ago, Martin claimed that the biggest challenges of the process would arise on the cutting room floor.
“When I did the first show, having seen my other friends’ specials live and then seeing how they got edited, I wanted to protect myself,” Martin said. “And by that I mean I wanted it to be the way it was when I shot it when it aired on TV.”
He added, “In my Comedy Central Presents show, I didn’t have any access to the edit. If you don’t have access, some guy you don’t know edits it a certain way and takes out the second punch line, for example, or takes your closer and puts it in the second act as opposed to the end of the show. They can do whatever they want. So, by doing something like the large pad or playing my guitar, it’s harder to edit because there’s the sequence to it.”
But Martin didn’t learn this industry savvy over night. In fact, one of his earlier jobs was as a writer for Conan O’Brien’s Late Night show in 2003, and later as a “Senior Youth” correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. From those experiences, Martin said he learned a lot about the industry, including how to write on a deadline.
“With Conan, you had to be on it, do your stuff, and hand it in,” Martin said. “At The Daily Show, I’d shoot the piece with the producer, and then we’d be in the editing room and Jon Stewart would come down and say, ‘let me see it.’ So it’s really cool because it’s not only screened for an audience, but also [for people you look up to].”
And while his late night experience was beneficial, Martin joked that he learned an even more important lesson from his time writing for these talk shows.
“I have a lot of respect for those guys, but I don’t want to do that job. That is a grind,” Martin said. “It’s [close] to doing real standup but with a lot more responsibility and staff. But it does have that pretty immediate feedback which is cool.”
But during his near-decade of mainstream standup success, Martin discovered his knack and passion for acting, which stemmed from a love of film and desire to write screenplays. In 2009, Martin created and starred in a sketch comedy series for Comedy Central called Important Things with Demetri Martin, which lasted two seasons. He also appeared in films such as The Rocker with Rainn Wilson as well as the HBO series Flight of the Concords. Though he admits that he’s still “learning as he goes” with acting, Martin is excited to absorb as much as he can from the talented people around him.
“My plan was always to write films and write parts for myself that I know I’d be perfect for, “ Martin said. “But I’d be psyched when I got parts even if they were small, because it’s cool to be on set with somebody like Ang Lee or Steven Soderbergh. It’s like being at school. I get to see how they get through their workday, how they shoot a scene, how they do the coverage … just all the different moving parts of a film. It’s really cool.”
An incredible amount of experiences have led Martin to his successful career, and even though he enjoys performing for every type of audience around the country, he says that his college fans are by far his favorite.
“College crowds are among the best because [college] is a very hopeful time in people’s lives. Even with the economy being as terrible as it has been, there’s still a certain kind of optimism and possibility on the college campus that you can’t really find anywhere else,” Martin said. “There’s a certain earnestness, and I really like that.”
His college fans especially will appreciate Standup Comedian and Martin’s honest, fresh flair on comedy. With this special, Martin is truly in his best form with his always-relatable material and quirky and unconventional methods. Authentically funny, quirky and genuinely kind, Demetri Martin is a comic that will continue to leave a lasting impact on audiences of all ages.
 
Demetri Martin. Standup Comedian. is available now on DVD, and the CD is available in stores and in HD on iTunes, Zune and Amazon Instant.

More often than not, filmgoers think of action films as popcorn flicks: mindless entertainment.
And there’s good reason for that: Consider The Fast and the Furious franchise, the Transformers trilogy and a handful of comic-book movies in between.
Game changer · Rian Johnson (left) directs Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the futuristic action film Looper. Though the movie makes use of genre conventions, it is a prime example of how an action film can transcend expectations through innovative techniques and thought-provoking themes. – | Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Publicity
Action films in general clearly entertain and tend to perform well at the box office, but often prove formulaic: Cars, girls, action, repeat.
Don’t get me wrong, readers. I love — and I mean love — a good action film. I rank Independence Day among the top of my favorite ’90s films, and The Bourne series — with the exception of The Bourne Legacy (sorry, Jeremy Renner) — is my go-to pick-me-up.
And as far as The Fast and the Furious franchise is concerned, I know I’m not the only one anxiously counting down the days until the sixth installment hits theaters. The awful, endlessly quotable dialogue is as bad as the action is good, and you can never really have enough Vin Diesel — seriously.
But as enjoyable as they are, The Fast and the Furious flicks — particularly Tokyo Drift — are not mind-blowing, well-crafted films, working to change the face of the industry. Instead, the pics — and action films in general — are typically considered to be low-brow entertainment that does little to advance the film medium as a whole.
But this assessment is a one-dimensional approach to analyzing action films, one that restricts the genre to archetypes. We need to broaden our snap judgments to consider the context in which we are watching the film.
People tend to think there is some universal rule that defines what makes a great piece of cinema. That just isn’t true. Our perceptions vary from genre to genre, and with that being the case, the way we criticize film needs to vary from genre to genre.
Just take a look at some of the films that are already in theaters or will be shortly. Viewers and critics can’t compare Taken 2 to The Master. They simply aren’t working on the same spectrum because they are built upon different foundations — they have completely different aims.
If Taken 2 is anything like its predecessor, it will adopt rapid-fire editing and high-speed action to pick up the pace of the story in an effort to entertain — key word: entertain — its audience. The Master, on the other hand, utilizes a slow-burn pace to play up dramatic moments and thought-provoking themes of religion, control, love and so forth. This is a film that has something to say about the world, and director Paul Thomas Anderson wants to make his audience think — key word: think. In an effort to reach their aims, the two films just operate differently by nature.
Mind you, this isn’t a disclaimer for action films. Viewers need to be critical of what they’re watching. In the process, however, they should not hold mindless action films to lower standards, but rather different ones. See, every single cinematic device — be that style, narrative, pace, themes or motifs — is informed by genre, and that needs to be taken into consideration while viewing a film. Tokyo Drift will not revolutionize the face of film, but it’s a favorite guilty pleasure of mine, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Sometimes a film just needs to be taken for what it is and nothing more.
Looper, however, is one of the rare exceptions to the commonplace action film. Writer and director Rian Johnson’s sci-fi thriller has only been out for a little more than a week, but critics have already hailed it as a progressive action film.
Rotten Tomatoes summed up the critical responses to the film, saying, “As thought-provoking as it is thrilling, Looper delivers an uncommonly smart, bravely original blend of futuristic sci-fi and good old-fashioned action.” The film has received a 93 percent critical average to match.
But for every Looper there are 10 Red Tails, for every The Dark Knight Rises there are 20 Battleships. Hyperbolic, yes, but the idea still stands: There is no denying the influx of poorly constructed action films. Perhaps Looper will serve as a catalyst for future thought-provoking, innovative action films. For now, action films seems to be happy to merely entertain viewers. But like I said before, there’s really nothing wrong with that.
With the exception of a few brilliant films like Looper, if viewers want to assess these films fairly, the solution here is plain and simple: Critique action films under the guise of their own genre. Heck, The Fast and the Furious films are not cinematic game-changers, but they’re great for what they are, and that’s what needs to be taken into consideration while viewing.

For most people basketball is merely a recreation sport — a game that replaces cardio in the Lyon Center. Let’s be honest, who needs cardio when you’re getting “swoll” by defying gravity and lifting really heavy objects off the ground.

But to the 1992 Lithuanian Olympic basketball team, basketball represents more than a sport, particularly considering Lithuania’s past clouded with annexation from the Soviet Union. The Other Dream Team,  a basketball documentary about the Lithuanians’ journey to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, revolves around the theme of how a basketball team brought a nation to prominence — in essence, taking the “dream team” definition to another level.
The Other Dream Team begins with the 1988 Seoul Olympics victory of the Soviet Union basketball team over the American team that boasted superstar center David Robinson. Of the five starters in this championship basketball team, four were Lithuanians who did not want to be associated with the Soviets. The film then explains this animosity between the players and the Soviet Union by displaying footage of Russia’s 1940 occupation of Lithuania. At its core, the film documents how the Lithuanians and their basketball team escaped Soviet Communism to form an independent nation.
Most poignantly, however, the film ends by displaying the independent Lithuanian basketball team rocking the Grateful Dead-sponsored tie-dye skeleton dunking T-shirt in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Viewers soon realize that the shirt symbolizes everything Lithuania stands for. Splattered with yellow, green and red (the Lithuanian colors), the shirt represents the passion, love and courage that the Lithuanian basketball team displays. This love — for basketball and their country — is intimately displayed throughout the film as players of The Other Dream Team talk about their experiences, which even include avoiding the former Russian secret police and intelligence agency, the KGB.
The Other Dream Team boasts themes akin to those found in other underdog stories; overcoming adversity, escaping comfort zones and ultimately the rising to historic fame, but in a true story. In one instance, Lithuanian basketball players are shown hiding in the trunk of a Cadillac “big enough to have a picnic in” as they travel through cities on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain. Real footage of the Russian occupation allows viewers to sympathize with the struggling country. Clips of Russian tanks killing innocent civilians, Russian soldiers dominating Lithuania and propaganda posters depicting the Soviet Union as an animal all make a compelling case for viewers to side with Lithuania.
Visual images notwithstanding, The Other Dream Team excels in terms of sound. Sponsored by the Grateful Dead, the film features an enjoyable soundtrack that perfectly depicts the mood of the movie. No, the soundtrack might not contain the Grateful Dead’s best hits, but appropriate music is used at appropriate times. In addition, the music is unforced and is only used when it needs to be.
The Other Dream Team also incorporates moving quotes in order to emotionally affect viewers. The intense nationalistic spirit of Lithuania is tangible throughout the entire film, and the director completely captures the essence of the WWII historical period. The plights and struggles that Lithuania endured under Soviet control is reflected through a very intimate point of view. The fact the director used the very players that went through the situation to retell the story ultimately made the movie much more profound.
The film becomes especially emotional when the basketball players recall their childhoods, how they built their own basketball court, hoops and backboard in order to play.
The Other Dream Team is a must watch for anyone who loves a good underdog story. This is a film for the go-getters, the dark horses that live for upsets and fight for freedom. If you fit these criteria, then this film is definitely worthwhile.
The shirt design referred to in your story was created by designer Greg Speirs, not the Grateful Dead. The Grateful Dead sponsored the team in the beginning but the major funds were actually donated by Greg Speirs after sales of his Tie Dye Slam Dunking Skeleton merchandise raised hundreds of thousands of dollars which only Speirs can claim to have donated. His donation extended to fund the 1997 team and a basketball school in Lithuania.
Speirs always retained rights in the Trademark Properties.

Twenty-one years ago, at 1137 W. 36th Pl., a USC student was trying to write a novel. He had just gone through a bad breakup, and he needed hope.
It came to him in a piece of dialogue for the story. He was writing a scene where the main character, an angry kid, said, “I guess [that’s just] one of the perks of being a wallflower.”

That line stopped Stephen Chbosky, the USC student who is now the writer-director of the recently released film The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
“I realized that was my title,” Chbosky said. “The kid I was writing was not a wallflower, so I abandoned that incarnation of the novel and just started thinking of that title. It all started at USC.”
Chbosky, a member of USC’s class of 1992, went on to write the story of Charlie, a quiet, observant high school freshman fighting personal demons. Since the novel’s release in 1999, many have embraced the story and the main character as their own. When he wrote the story, however, Chbosky said he never considered how other people might receive it.
“I wasn’t really thinking about the reader then, I was just thinking about Charlie and what he was going through and trying to answer the question for myself about why good people let themselves get treated so badly,” Chbosky said. “The book was my answer to that, and I’m just glad it’s been able to help people since.”
Though the book is fictional and set in high school, The Perks of Being a Wallflower represents a combination of Chbosky’s high school and college experiences.
“A lot of those things that [the characters go through]were things I observed as much in college as in high school,” Chbosky said. “It’s not like ‘coming-of-age’ stops after you graduate high school; the college years are vitally important because you’re finally on your own and you finally have the right atmosphere to live as you want to live.”
A film adaptation has allowed the story to evolve, as well. More than a decade later, Chbosky had the opportunity to add to the story in ways not possible with the novel.
“The one thing that movies have is editing, it’s juxtaposition,” Chbosky said. “In a book you can never have a kid taking communion at Christmas, and cut from him taking the communion wafer to his mouth and taking his hand away, and now we’re inside a New Year’s Eve Party. I love it. I learned a lot of that at USC, how to take two ideas and create something unique and special and that’s the best part of movies to me.”
Though the film is set in Pittsburgh, Chbosky said that many aspects of the story were directly influenced by his time at USC.
“So much of the experiences that took place in the book [happened to me] at USC,” Chbosky said. “Stewart Stern — he was a professor at USC, and he directly inspired the character that Paul Rudd plays in the film, the teacher Mr. Anderson.”
Chbosky said that Stern, who wrote the screenplay for Rebel Without a Cause among other films, was a big reason he decided to go to USC in the first place. After hearing Stern lecture during his college tour, Chbosky knew he had to go USC.
“I’m a 17-year-old kid from Pittsburgh who doesn’t know anybody and suddenly I’m listening to this man at USC talk about how he met James Dean and would travel with Marlon Brando. And Paul Newman is his best friend,” Chbosky said. “I was so blown away by this person and that he was just giving an informal seminar to a bunch of USC students. I knew that this was the school that I had to go to because not only was he there, but it was the kind of school that could attract somebody like him.”
That wasn’t to be Chbosky’s only encounter with Stern, though. After Chbosky started at USC, he learned that Stern had suffered a massive heart attack and sent him — in true wallflower fashion — an anonymous letter.
“I wanted to thank him for changing my life because USC was such a great place for me,” Chbosky said. “I didn’t sign the letter, but he figured out it was me. This is the testament to USC professors. It took him awhile, but he eventually figured out it was me and he’s been my mentor ever since.”
Chbosky now has advice of his own for aspiring writers at USC.
“Pay attention, nurture, support, challenge and find that voice that is uniquely yours, the passion that is uniquely yours, it will lead you to your best work,” Chbosky said. “Do it for those personal reasons because that’s going to lead to the most authentic story and the most authentic personal story ironically becomes the most universal.”
Chbosky added that students should reach out to their teachers. He still keeps in touch with Stern, who now resides in Seattle and was the first person to read the screenplay for The Perks of Being a Wallflower. When the film premiered in Seattle a few weeks ago, Chbosky was able to live one of his dreams in sharing a Q&A session with his mentor.
“It was one of the greatest moments of my life, to finally sit side by side with the greatest teacher I ever had and talk about our work,” Chbosky said. “It was definitely an infinite moment for me.”
 
The Perks of Being a Wallflower is out now in limited release.
He certainly didn’t write Star Wars so who cares

Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill into law on Sept. 22 that allows not just doctors, but also nurse practitioners and other clinicians to perform non-surgical abortions in California.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The bill, Senate Bill 623, is highly anticipated by Californians in a time where medical care is not affordable for all, nor is reproductive health care accessible for all women.
According to the Los Angeles Times, half of California counties do not have a physician who regularly gives abortions — one alarming problem the bill aims to tackle. The policies introduced by SB 623 are a step in the right direction for providing statewide access to abortions across all socioeconomic classes.
A low income can result in an inability to afford condoms or abortions, which can lead to accidental pregnancies. People don’t often think about the effect financial difficulties have on pregnancy rates, but there is a correlation between the two.
By allowing people of lower incomes access to abortions and birth control, SB 623 sheds light on a growing issue and becomes a stepping stone in solving the problem. Perhaps lower income households in California, with growing access to certified abortion specialists, will have fewer unplanned children.
Giving non-physicians — nurse practitioners, physician assistants and certified nurse midwives — the right to perform abortions might also allow some women to receive abortions before they have access to a doctor. And earlier access to medical resources means fewer complications and better results.
Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and many other pro-choice groups support the change in access, but there are also many opposing forces, such as the California Catholic Conference and the California Right to Life Committee, that criticize the bill for expediting access to abortions.
Another major criticism is that allowing less-trained professionals to perform abortions will potentially cause unsafe medical procedures. Yet on Aug. 30, Yahoo! cited studies concluding abortions are just as safe when performed by trained nurse practitioners, midwives and physician assistants as when doctors perform them. Researchers compared first-trimester abortion complications and side effects from abortions performed by doctors versus those from abortions performed by trained practitioners and found no differences in the complications.
In light of the more than 100 abortion-restrictive state measures that have been passed in the last year, SB 623 — as a measure that promotes rather than restricts access — indicates that abortion continues to be a hot-button, controversial issue that is not widely agreed upon.
The decision, however, to terminate a pregnancy is an incredibly personal one that should be treated as such.
Not to mention, the freedom to choose to have an abortion still remains a legal right that should be protected. Without certified officials who can help all citizens of all incomes to exercise this right, what good is having liberties at all?
Brown set a national example by signing SB 623 and protecting not only women’s right to choice, but also their access to quality reproductive health care. If citizens of any socioeconomic group possess a certain right, they must also have access to quality facilities in which they are able to realistically exercise this right.
Currently, only 11 states allow non-physicians to perform abortions. Hopefully, California’s addition to this number will convince the rest of the nation of the benefits of widespread access and protection of reproductive rights.

Wow… The author has several flaws in her argument.  Foremost, she makes the common mistake of suggesting that just because someone has a right to something, that they also therefore deserve it, and are entitled to it.  Everyone has the right to buy a car, but not everyone can afford one.  Everyone has the right to a good paying job, but not everyone deserves one.  Everyone has the right to a gun, but not everyone needs one.  People of lesser econimic means who can’t afford a car must adjust by learning to navigate public transportation, or finding work close to home.  People without advanced degrees, or of lesser intellect, are often resigned to lower-paying, less-skilled work.  
Another problem with her argument is the premise itself.  The author literally claims that the fact that half of California’s counties don’t have physicians who regularly perform abortions is “an alarming problem”.  Really?  Read that sentence again.  Wow!!  What’s alarming is someone thinking that we need an abortion doctor in every county, like we need police and fire services, or quality schools and safe roads.  Frankly, this author echoes a lack of ethical clarity and critical thinking found in much of the abortion debate.
Those who vehemently defend abortion (the right, and the practice) should be reminded of one of life’s great maxims:  Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.  Guns are perhaps the best example of this, and I’ve always noted that Democrats are as guilty with abortion as Republicans are with guns.  Both sides kling to their respective rights, with no understanding of the inherent responsibilities.  Just because one can own a gun, doesn’t mean one should.. yet Republicans rigidly defeat every attempt by the left to regulate the ownership of guns while maintaining the right to own one.  Likewise, Democrats concede nothing in Republican attempts to regulate abortion, including measures such as parental notification or age restrictions.  Instead, Democrats protect the unqualified right of any woman at any age, for any reason and at any time, to have an abortion.  It’s truly sad.
A final note on the author’s flawed argument:  She writes that Governor Brown set a “national example” by signing SB 623… then noted that 11 states allow non-physicians to perform abortion.  I would hardly say that Governor Brown set an example if roughly 20 percent of US states already have similar measures in place.
Mind your own business people!  Sometimes I go bareback with the ladies and things get out of control.  I need this to keep my lifestyle unhindered by some mini-me
I would challenge anyone reading this article, and who also believes in “reproductive rights”,
to do the following ASAP, preferably before the end of this weekend.
Go to YouTube and view an actual abortion taking place of an innocent little boy or girl.
Forget “reproductive rights” for a minute. What happened to the boy or girl who was killed?
Our Country’s Constitution guarantees us the Right to Life, Liberty, & the Pursuit of Happiness.
Regardless of whether you believe in an after-life of not, your “choice” to kill will be judged
by the one who gave YOU life. You denied your offspring ALL of his/her rights. All for what? SELF.
It’s been 29+ years since an old girlfriend of mine self-ishly aborted our child (for career purposes) and it’s something that I continually think about at least 3-5 times per week. The treating of other human beings as OBJECTS to satisfy our own SELF~ish desires has a Ripple Effect of ugly consequences.
Watch one of these Videos. This is REALITY.
It happens every day. Does it make it right when this evil act is repeated? You’ll find out soon enough.
After YOUR death. In Eternity.
Let’s call a spade a spade.  Murdering an unborn child has nothing to do with “reproductive health” and making the process more accessible and affordable does not make it more acceptable.

Essential to any top-tier university’s success is a positive public image. And essential to any positive public image is philanthropy, outreach and public service.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
USC accomplishes all three of these through its Good Neighbors Campaign. The fundraiser, held annually each October, supports university-community partnerships such as Troy Camp and the Community Health Fair. This year’s fundraising goal is a not-so-modest $1.6 million — $100,000 more than last year’s record-breaking total.
Campaigns like the GNC, however, are predicated by more than just reputation. Being a good neighbor to surrounding communities honors USC’s commitment to education, public service and personal and communal development — a commitment integral to the school’s mission. But community engagement goes hand in hand with community awareness, and on that front, USC has faltered as of late.
USC has recently implemented projects that threaten the same community it has pledged to support. Most recently, USC’s University Village redevelopment project was halted by the Los Angeles City Council after it was determined not to have taken the affordable housing needs of community members under full consideration.
USC now faces a disgruntled neighborhood, a delayed construction project and a public relations faux pas because it momentarily forgot that engaging with the community goes beyond the mere pledge to do so.
Students, alumni and administrators must support community initiatives like the GNC to ensure that USC’s commitment to community is upheld and to meet our responsibilities to society as an enlightened center of wealth.
USC’s mission vows to foster “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.”
Such development necessitates community engagement for two reasons: On the individual level, community service exposes students to a wider range of lifestyles, backgrounds and circumstances, encouraging a more complete understanding of the world in which we live.
The GNC, for example, helps to fund the Joint Educational Project, which allows students to experience firsthand the problems of a tightly budgeted, under-staffed inner-city education system. JEP gives students the opportunity to provide supplementary instruction and tutoring to kids in local elementary, middle and high schools, giving them the rare opportunity to recognize their own educational privilege while passing on the knowledge and skills afforded by that privilege to a less fortunate community.
On the social level, community engagement through the GNC better equips community members themselves to contribute to society. JEP, for example, enhances the academic capabilities of local children, improving their chances of graduating from high school, entering college and realizing their full potential within society.
In this way, community engagement gives of itself. The more effort, care and financial support that institutions of means such as USC put into the community, the more resources the community has at its disposal to further its own enrichment. The effects of one intervention — teaching a child to read before he or she reaches kindergarten, offering a job to a local resident, introducing a student to his or her creative passion — can continue to benefit society and, in turn, USC for years to come. USC and its students need only set the pendulum in motion.
It is, perhaps, for this reason that USC names public service as one of the principle means by which its mission is accomplished, alongside teaching, research, artistic creation and professional practice. And it is, perhaps, for this reason that USC students collectively log more than 900,000 hours of volunteer work each year.
But we can do better.
The GNC donation website poses a challenge to potential donors: “Are you a good neighbor?” But asking that question requires that USC sets the standard of being a good neighbor, something the university is not currently doing with regards to its handling of the UV project.
As long as the GNC and similar initiatives are appreciated as more than political tokens — as long as the fundamental importance of reciprocal support between university and community are understood — we can prevent seemingly inconsiderate mistakes like this one from happening again. We can preserve the commitment to education, public service and personal and communal development that will truly make our university a place for critical thinking and positive change.
We must never let this commitment go. We must remain the university we claim to be. And that requires making the difficult ethical choices in a world full of easy business decisions.

Unfortunately, the readers have bought into the idea that these folks represent the community. They do not. 
The remark about Councilman Parks is particularly off base. He is in no way connected to this group which claims to be community based but is in fact not.
The fact that SAJE may have offices nearby does not make them community based. The real community is not being heard.
This article should have been titled “FRANCESCA BESSEY’S OPINION”
So,
you want USC to write the community a cheque for $20million–this is what they are demanding.
To say we have failed in our interaction with the community because we refuse to fund  private housing for poorer souls is like saying I have failed as a father because I cannot afford to send my kids to a private school. Your argument is severly flawed. 
USC has engaged our community better than just about any school anywhere.  Just because a few politicians, Bernard Parks, wants some money for his district so he can get reelected, you fall for this rediculous idea that USC is failing in this aspect. I disagree strongly.

In the fall semester of 2010, a San Jose State University sociology class created an idea to benefit their community: to raise the city’s minimum wage.
After gathering more than 40,000 signatures, the students’ proposal became Measure D, an official measure on the November ballot. The citizens of San Jose now have a chance to enact this significant legislation.
As USC students, we are uniquely positioned in a community that is also significantly affected by minimum-wage legislation.
The minimum wage has already been increased in San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Santa Fe, N.M. — students should follow San Jose’s example and support and lobby for a similar measure in Los Angeles.
Measure D would increase San Jose’s minimum wage by 25 percent, from $8 to $10. With endorsements from Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and a host of California assembly members, it is entirely possible that the wage increase will be approved.
With a poverty rate of almost 20 percent, approximately 1 million children living under the poverty level and a minimum wage that puts those receiving it significantly below the estimated living wage, a minimum wage increase in Los Angeles would be a major benefit for millions of people.
This is not some far-off problem, either. A quick walk down Figueroa Street includes McDonald’s, Subway and many other companies that pay minimum wage. The campus center itself is home to Panda Express, Carl’s Jr. and California Pizza Kitchen. USC students interact with people who are being paid below the living wage every day.
The main argument against raising the minimum wage is that it will hurt small businesses. But according to a National Employment Law Project report, nearly 70 percent of businesses that pay their workers minimum wage have more than 100 employees — and many are large, international corporations.
Though a select number of people continue to benefit from the current minimum wage, they are far outnumbered by those who depend on it. A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics study reveals that nearly 75 million Americans hold minimum wage jobs. Few people realize, however, just how difficult it is to live on a minimum wage job.
While inflation continues to rise and the cost of living continues to expand, minimum wage has continued to stagnate.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, minimum wage is worth 30 percent less than it was in 1968, and if raised in accordance with inflation the current minimum wage would be $10.55 an hour. Though raising the minimum wage to $10 would still fall under this inflated rate, a person working 40 hours per week would be earning $320 more per month. An extra $320 per month for someone who is working on minimum wage and trying to support themselves or their family, however, would make a tremendous difference.
Raising the minimum wage in Los Angeles would also lead to a domino effect of benefits: A high number of increased salaries would spark increased spending that would, in turn, boost the local economy.
Increasing Los Angeles’ minimum wage is only one beneficial measure that could be taken by USC students, as numerous other issues currently impact the city and the area surrounding USC. Any of them could benefit immensely from student help.
Whether or not you agree with Measure D, it is undeniably extraordinary that a group of college students and a sociology professor took a class project and propelled it so far outside the classroom that it is now a referendum up for vote.
Not only is USC full of resources, connections and information that students should use to take action and spark change, it is located in a community that would especially benefit from this kind of student initiative.
Students should remember this, and hey — who knows, you might just change the law in a major American city.

An entry level job seeker should be focused on more than just what the initial pay is. They can not discount the skills they will gain. Increase your skills and increase value. Entry level employment is a stepping stone to higher wages and you get paid to be trained.
You make some great points. But min wage jobs do one thing and this will take it away. That is to give a person with no skills there first job. Once you get skills you become more valuable hence you get raises. It’s called supply and demand. As a business owner I hire people with no skills at $8 a hour and also with skills and pay them more. If this Measure D passes I will no longer higher the no skills work crew as why pay someone with no skills at $10 when I can hire someone from San Carlos with a lot of skills at $10 a hour.
This teacher who teaches at SJ state didn’t take that into effect. So this so called project is going to cost countless teens there first job and its just not GREEN. So parents fire up those SUVs as you will be driving your kids to San Carlos, Hollister, etc for there first job as you will find no one willing to pay a person with NO experience $10 a hour.  WAY TO BE GREEN
I completely agree with you Bob. I too hire young workers with no work experience. As they gain skills, we raise their pay as we do not want to start over training someone new. They become valuable. Something that gets overlooked is also the fact that it costs money to train an unskilled worker.
I am sure you experience the same as I, that when this person moves on with future employment, the skills they gain are of great benefit to them. In other words… they were paid to gain skills and training!
Thank you for your well developed argument for raising the minimum wage and for supporting the effort to do so in San Jose.  We consider your article a strong endorsement for Measure D and we’re delighted to have it . Thanks for spreading the effort to do the right thing for working families.
Hope you have good skill set Stacey as the first thing I’m going to do is let the worker go with a weak skill set at $8 a hour and hire a person from say in San Carlos making $9 since I have to now pay $10 a hour. I’m going to require a much higher skill set to flip my hamburgers. Not sure why no one comments on this put this Measure D takes being GREEN and puts it out on the curb. If your a kid looking for a first time job good luck as you won’t find one in San Jose. They will be given to people from the other cities with a better skill set. Again way to be GREEN.
Great article. Hope this kid goes to DC after graduation. Go Bruins.

There’s nothing quite like the opening of a new coffee shop to make people nod their heads and agree that “Yes, that certainly is another place I can now buy coffee.”
It’s a lack of enthusiasm felt by hundreds of USC students last week in response to the christening of Icon Plaza’s very own Starbucks. Maybe a handful of students who call Icon home are excited about the coffee joint just down the stairs, but there are entirely too many coffee franchises on and around the USC campus.
Let’s take a moment to tally up just how many establishments within walking distance of Tommy Trojan are in the caffeinated beverage business.
The Tutor Center has a Coffee Bean. There’s the beloved Ground Zero. Literatea caters to the high-brow scholar. Popovich Café lies opposite. The engineering, law, and architecture schools all have their own cafes, while the School of Cinematic Arts boasts another Coffee Bean roughly a quarter mile from the first. A Seattle’s Best lies next to Freebirds, with Gateway slinging free joe just next door.
Top this off with the two preexisting Starbucks locations—one in the University Village and one which just replaced the former Trojan Grounds this past August—and Icon’s new coffee spot starts to seem excessive.
Still in doubt? Let’s not forget that the Tuscany area has yet another Coffee Bean of literally across the street from Icon Plaza. That puts the new Starbucks less than ten seconds from another coffee shop. Talk about overkill.
Was thirteen of these places really not enough? Surely there’s something more exciting that could have filled that location instead? It speaks to a lack of imagination that—much like this all-encompassing matrix of grounded bean dispensaries—is starting to leave a bitter taste in student mouths.

Original Date of Publication: Oct. 4, 1960
The eagerness with which political candidates gather youthful votes will reach nationwide status with the individual appearances of Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy on the USC campus.
This was the opinion voiced by Dr. Carl Q. Christol, political science department head, who noted that both presidential hopefuls have chosen “the leading private university in California” as their vote-getting battleground.
“The acceptance by Vice President Nixon and Sen. Kennedy of the invitation to appear individually on this campus indicates two things,” he felt.
First, they recognize that California is an extremely important state in terms of electoral votes. Their being here is a result of the belief of each that to win they must carry California, the department head said.
 
New Voters
“It also indicates the joint recognition of each candidate that many of the new voters of college age are undecided at this moment as to how their vote will be cast,” Dr. Christol continued.
He added that “it is equally important to note that Los Angeles is the center of the communications industry. Therefore, their appearance will receive complete radio, television and press coverage.”
Dr. Joseph L. Nyomarkay also a USC political science professor, explored a different side of the personal appearance by discussing the obligation which well-informed voters have to their candidate and their nation.
 
Post Actions
“Today it is important to make up your mind on the basis of what the candidates have to say while also considering what action they have taken in the past,” he said.
“One should first know the candidate’s record, consider what he is doing now and add both together to determine what he will do in the future, “Dr. Nyomarkay advised.
“In view of these facts, these personal appearances are of most value to those who are aware of the basic political issues. With this awareness, they will be able to discriminate and evaluate the candidates rationally,” he said.
 
Profiles of Candidates Show Career Variety
Kennedy’s Career Began in Congress
Democratic Sen. John F. Kennedy began his legislative career of 13 years in the U.S. Congress.
While a Representative from Massachusetts from 1946 to 1952 he was an active supporter of the labor movement.
Switching to the Senate in 1952 in a surprise victory over Republican candidate Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., Kennedy continued his support of labor, although he became increasingly aware of corrupt activities in the labor movement.
In 1956, Senator Kennedy was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his best-selling book, “Profiles in Courage.” Before and immediately following WW II, he was a correspondent for the Chicago Herald American and International News Service, covering the Potsdam Conference, the United Nations Conference and the British elections of 1945.
Kennedy graduated with honors from Harvard University in 1940 and did graduate work at Stanford. He has been awarded honorary Doctor of Law degrees by eighteen colleges and universities, including Harvard, Syracuse, Notre Dame and Brandeis.
 
Law Started Nixon on Public Career
Republican Presidential Candidate Richard M. Nixon began his career of public service as a member of the legal staff of the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C., in 1942.
He served as a Combat Air Transport Commander in the South Pacific during World War II, leaving active duty in 1946 with the rank of Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy.
In 1946, Nixon was voted into his first elective office, a Representative in the U.S. Congress. He was re-elected to the House in 1948 and in 1950 was sent to the U.S. Senate with a plurality of 700,000 votes.
In 1952, the then Senator Nixon was elected vice president of the United States as Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate. He was re-elected in 1956.
As vice president, Nixon presided over several of the President’s committees and assumed additional responsibilities during the President’s three illnesses.
Nixon has been described by President Eisenhower as being better prepared for the Presidency than any man in the history of America.

Turning eighteen is a rite of passage. You can smoke, gamble, take out loans, lease an apartment—and you can apply for a credit card.
While a birthday celebration may or may not include one or more of the latter privileges, the first week is bound to include at least a few solicitations from credit card companies.
As alarming as it is that credit card companies know your birthday, that is the least of your problems. If young people aren’t careful, early credit card ads can become early credit cards, which can become early—and hefty—credit card debt.
Credit cards are dangerous toys for anyone. Three recent lawsuits, brought against credit card giants American Express Co., Discover Financial Services, and Capital One, demonstrate how these companies seem set on taking advantage of everyone, regardless of age.
According to the Los Angeles Times, American Express agreed Monday to refund a total of $85 million to 250,000 customers, for violations of consumer protection laws that included falsely promising bonuses, charging improper late payments and deceiving customers about the benefits of paying off old debts.
Discover and Capital One paid $200 million and $150 million, respectively, in settlements earlier this year.
In these cases, victimized customers were lucky enough to have the law step in. However, limited experience in the credit world makes young people particularly vulnerable to these kinds of tricks.
Young people also may not sufficiently grasp of the concept of debt. Most college students, particularly students at private institutions like USC, are still supported by their parents and have not yet been exposed to the mountain of expenses—food, rent, cable, cell phone bills, gas—that makes paying off debt exceptionally difficult. They haven’t yet experienced the negative consequences of spending too much.
Finally, according to the Federal Trade Commission, adults between the ages of 20 and 29 were the most common victims of identity theft in 2010.
Thus, while credit cards are a useful tool, they are also a pile of hazards for the young adult. Any student thinking about using one would do well to consider and understand the risks.

There are very few shows on television that make viewers realize, understand and appreciate their own humanity. Luckily for everyone, there’s Boston Med and NY Med.
These two ABC medical documentary series, created and produced by renowned journalist and documentary modernizer Terry Wrong, are some of the most compelling and emotional 16 hours in contemporary network television history. The shows combine the concept of cinéma vérité and narrative techniques of fiction that result in riveting real life accounts of the doctors and patients at some the country’s top hospitals.
Boston Med and NY Med, which aired during the summers of 2010 and 2012 respectively, consist of eight parts each and are both available to watch on Hulu. With their fascinating fly-on-the-wall stories of frantic emergency room visits, heart-wrenching tales of the organ transplant process, as well as a look at the personal lives of the doctors, surgeons, nurses and residents, these two amazing shows prove to have something for everyone.
One of the most interesting and unconventional aspects of the shows is that neither employs the use of narrators to bind together the parallel storylines. Instead, the countless hours of footage that Wrong and his team collected demonstrates the talent of the videographers and editors alike. By asking his crew to compile the best five minutes of the 20 hours of film they captured every day on their hand-held cameras, Wrong was able to accomplish what a scripted series could only dream of producing — authentic and unsurpassed human emotion that only real, everyday people are capable of.
Only have time for one episode? Check out the season finale of Boston Med, which wonderfully documents only the second successful partial face transplant in United States history. The episode’s remarkable narrative structure and the miraculous medical process in itself make this episode especially phenomenal to watch.
Whether you’re an aspiring doctor yourself or someone who is just curious about the behind the scenes occurrences at a top hospital, look no further than these brilliantly done documentary series. Entertaining, poignant and uplifting, Boston Med and NY Med are the definitions of must-watch TV.
