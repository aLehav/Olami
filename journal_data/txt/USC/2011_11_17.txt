Dave Stockton graduated from USC in 1964 with a bachelor’s in general management. In 1964, Stockton won the Pac-10 men’s golf individual title and was an All-American golfer. Stockton is a two time PGA Championship champion.
In 1996 Stockton wrote Dave Stockton’s Putt to Win: Secrets for Mastering the Other Game of Golf and has since helped professionals golfers, including Phil Mickelson. He recently became involved in the Chevron Educational Program, an auxiliary education program sponsored by Chevron to increase science, technology, engineering and math in schools across the country.

As part of the Chevron Educational Program, Stockton taught “The Science of Golf” at the Wallis Annenberg Building for Science Learning and Innovation at the California Science Center in Exposition Park on Thursday.
 
Daily Trojan: Why did you choose to attend USC?
Dave Stockton: Both my mom and my dad graduated from USC. I only applied to two schools, Arizona and USC, where I ended up with a golf scholarship. My son went to USC also. That’s three straight generations of All-Americans involved in USC golf.
 
DT: Who did you look up to while in school?
Stockton: My dad. He and I became the first father-son to both be All-Americans in the same sport at USC. We both won the Pac-10 individual titles — some 30 years apart. I also really looked up to [fellow golfer] Al Geiberger. I followed him to USC. Al was unbelievable and practically unbeatable in college. He was four years older but we became fast friends on the tour. It was a great friendship.
 
DT: How did your experience at USC impact your career?
Stockton: A lot of my classes have come in handy, especially the public speaking courses since I do a lot of motivational speaking nowadays. My education at USC definitely prepared me for what I came on tour to do. Yes, I play golf, but there are lots of problems traveling and dealing with people. It’s not as glamorous as most people would believe it to be.
 
DT: How did you get involved with the Chevron Educational Program?
Stockton: I was asked a couple weeks ago. I’m looking forward to doing work with the kids; this is right down my wheelhouse. I’m really looking forward to the task of motivating these kids to think outside of the box and have math and science mean something to them.
 
DT: Can you explain the science behind a golf ball?
Stockton: You can absolutely buy a good golf game — as long as you’re still mentally in it. For example, when I played my best on tour, I averaged less than 245 yards off the tee. Flash-forward 35 years and I’m averaging over 255. I didn’t change — the clubs did. If you have a shaft and a little wrench, you can whip a club together in about seven seconds. If the ball goes too far to the right, you change the screw in the toe. Too far to the left and you change the screw in the heel. If the face isn’t quite right, you can change the sole on the bottom of it — there are so many different ways to improve.
 
DT: How are you staying involved in the golf world?
Stockton: I’m basically stopping my career. I played at Newport Beach last year and will probably play again next year. I enjoy teaching now. I was just listed by Golf Digest as the 13th best teacher in the world. After only teaching for a year and a half, to be ranked that well made me feel pretty good. I wrote a book that’s out now, Unconscious Putting: Dave Stockton’s Guide to Unlocking Your Signature Stroke and it’s sold well [more than] 50,000 copies in a month — 20,000 more than expected. For just turning 70 a couple weeks ago, I think I’m doing rather well.
 
DT: Any words you’d like to share with the Trojan Family?
Stockton: I take a lot of pride in the fact that my family is made up of Trojans. I spend a lot of time going to all of the football games and visiting the museums. I live and die with the football team and all the other sports. … I’m very proud to be a Trojan.
Great questions even though I am not a golfer the infomation was very interesting. Did not know you could do things with a club to help your game.  The information about his family history was a nice touch for the readers.
Thank you for the details.

Though recent findings suggest video gaming might be addictive, several of those involved with USC’s video game program said the issue probably affects a minority of gamers.
Don’t hate the player · The USC Gamers Network hosted an eight-hour video game tournament, USC’s largest ever, in The Forum of the campus center in September. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan
 
A study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry on Tuesday showed frequent video game players display a structural change in their brain similar to that observed in gambling addicts. The study, headed by Simone Kuhn of Ghent University in Belgium, found 14-year-olds who play video games frequently have more gray matter in their striatum, a part of the brain associated with rewarding feelings.
The study suggests that video gaming addiction could be similar to that of narcotics, though further research is needed.
Many of those at USC involved with video games, however, said they feel studies like these represent a specific minority.
Sanjay Madhav, who teaches video game programming courses in the information technology program, said he is skeptical of the purported addictive qualities of video games. He likened video games to any other number of distractions that students occupy themselves with.
“In general, these sorts of studies can be misleading,” Madhav said. “Gaming is just one of a plethora of recreational activities that can become addicting for a small few. I wouldn’t be surprised if a study on people addicted to fantasy football shows that the brain response is similar.”
Students involved in the gaming scene at USC echoed Madhav’s opinions on the addictiveness of gaming. Mark Platzer, a junior majoring in music industry, and Graham Hawes, a sophomore majoring in computer science with an emphasis on games, are members of USC eSports, a group dedicated to competitive video game playing.
Platzer said he firmly believes student-gamers, especially those at USC, do not let gaming take over their lives completely.
“Even the most hardcore of gamers I know will put their work before their games if it’s an important enough project,” Platzer said. “It’s more the traditional social life that gets overshadowed by games.”
Hawes said he believes gaming is a lot of fun, but that fun should not be confused as an addictive quality.
“I don’t think the medium itself is more dangerous in terms of addiction when you compare it to things we consider addictive right now, like drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes,” Hawes said. “Especially when you consider the side-effects of those things.”
Josh Durica, a junior majoring in computer science, said he could see video gaming as potentially addictive.
“It’s definitely possible to spend too much time on video games, just like it’s possible to spend too much time on anything else,” Durica said. “It’s possible to not want to do any other work because you like gaming so much. There’s definitely potential in getting caught up in playing too many games.”
Sure, everyone loves to gamble . . . if they win. But, the person sitting next to you in church, the man in line at the grocery store, or one of your co-workers; any one of these could be involved with a gambling problem. Imagine your grandmother committing a crime to support her gambling addiction. I am a recovering alcoholic, gambler, and have recovered from other addictive behaviors. I published a book, Gripped by Gambling, where the readers can follow the destructive path of the compulsive gambler, a prison sentence, and then on to the recovery road. 
I recently published a second book, Switching Addictions, describing additional issues that confront the recovering addict. If a person who has an addictive personality, doesn’t admit to at least two addictions, he’s not being honest. These are two books you might consider adding to your library. I also publish a free online newsletter, Women Helping Women, which has been on-line for more than ten years and is read by hundreds of women (and men) from around the world.  (www.femalegamblers.info). I have been interviewed many times, and appeared on the 60 Minutes show in January 2011, which was moderated by Leslie Stahl.
Sincerely,
Marilyn Lancelot

The number of students from India at USC declined from fall 2010 to fall 2011, following a growing trend at universities across the nation.
India ranked fourth among the top geographic areas outside the United States for USC enrollment with 1,265 students from India enrolled at USC, which represents a 15 percent decrease over the last academic year, according to the Office of International Services.
This year there was a 1 percent drop in the number of students from India currently enrolled at universities in the United States. Students from India comprise 14.4 percent of international college students in the United States, which remains the most sought after destination for Indian students, according to the 2011 Open Doors annual survey by the United States International Institute of Education.
Jaynit Raheja, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the high cost of education in the United States is discouraging students from India to study abroad. The average annual cost of private university education in India is $3,620, according to the Indian Ministry for Human Resource Development. The average annual tuition at a four-year private university in the United States is $36,000, according to the College Board.
“The cost of education in the [United States] is way higher than it is in India. Hence, many students are choosing to stay back and then study abroad for their post-grad degrees,” Raheja said.
The most common major for Indian students is engineering. More than 36 percent of Indian students are pursuing careers in these fields because of cultural values based on science and math-based education, according to the Open Doors survey.
Tony Tambascia, executive director of the Office of International Services, said the university’s increased presence in India, including the opening of a new office in Mumbai this year, will help reverse the current decline in enrollment of Indian students.
“USC has a strong history of enrolling students from India, as well as some key partnerships with institutions in that country. And recently USC has increased our presence in India, specifically by establishing a new office in Mumbai, as well as increased recruiting by admission staff,” Tambascia said. “These efforts will help the university maintain its position as a leading destination for some of the best students from India.”
Raheja said despite a decrease in the number of students from India enrolled at the university, attending USC is still a valuable experience.
“USC enables Indians to gain exposure to and respect different cultures while still being in touch with their own culture,” Raheja said. “Life in India is very family oriented; studying at USC has allowed me to become a part of a new family, the Trojan Family.”

A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is the front-runner for the GOP ticket with support from 27 percent of registered Republicans in the state.
Stand up · Thousands of protestors gathered Thursday in Downtown Los Angeles as part of Occupy L.A. A recent poll found 47 percent of Californians support the occupy movement. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
 
The poll also found support for the Occupy Wall Street movement is divided along party lines.
Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain trails behind Romney with 20 percent of registered California Republicans’ support, followed by Newt Gingrich with 14 percent, Ron Paul with 6 percent and Rick Perry with 3 percent.
While Romney’s support among California primary voters has not wavered for much of the year, his opponent has changed, said the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Dan Schnur. In a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll conducted in September, Romney and Perry had 22 percent support of Republican primary voters and Cain had 4 percent support.
According to the most recent poll, among supporters of the Tea Party, Cain has a slight lead of three points over Romney.
Forty-seven percent of California voters reported favoring the Occupy Wall Street movement and 33 percent said they oppose it.
When asked what the movement says about the country, a majority of Democrats said they agree with what the movement is suggesting, while a majority of Republicans reported disagreeing. Sixty-two percent of registered Democrats agreed and 15 disagreed; 21 percent of registered Republicans agreed and 55 percent disagreed.
Yul Kim, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said she agrees with the statement Occupy Wall Street protesters are making.
“Corporations being greedy are unfair to the 99 percent,” Kim said. “I admire all the people out there who are not at work and participating in this movement for the greater good and the majority of society.”
The poll also found approval for President Barack Obama, at 50 percent, has not changed significantly since the last USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, conducted in September. African-American and Latino voters overwhelmingly support Obama, with 81 percent and 64 percent, respectively, saying they approve of the job he is doing.
The poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters in California, was conducted over a period of nearly two weeks. The margin of error for the overall sample is 2.52 percentage points.

The USC-UCLA rivalry has never been this heated.
The Bruins’ and Trojans’ men’s water polo teams — tied for No. 1 atop the NCAA top-20 poll — face off today for a 7 p.m. matchup at the Spieker Aquatics Center in Westwood. The outcome of the game is not only a matter of pride but will determine who will head into the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament as the top seed.
“It’s a good matchup to have two number one’s going at it here in Southern California,” senior driver Peter Kurzeka said. “It should be a battle and I think there is gonna be a good crowd and it’s gonna be a good atmosphere for the sport of water polo in general.”
Chasing perfection · Senior driver Peter Kurzeka looks to lead USC to its third undefeated MPSF record in four seasons at UCLA tonight. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (19-2, 7-0) go into the game against the Bruins (19-3, 5-1), the last of the regular season, as the only undefeated team in MPSF play.
The Trojans are coming off a narrow victory against No. 7 Pacific on Nov. 13. The top-ranked USC team fought hard for its 11-10 win, with the game going into overtime. Junior driver Tobias Preuss helped carry the team to a victory with his performance in the first overtime period.
“Someone always steps up in close games and for us [against Pacific] it was Toby [Preuss],” Kurzeka said. “In overtime he scored two huge goals and then we were able to lock it down on defense — and that’s what we’ve been able to do, that’s how we won last year’s final. We kind of wear teams down and we know that if we get into overtimes we’re usually be the team that’s in better shape that’s able to keep our cool a little bit more and focus.”
In terms of players that have proven themselves to be essential this season for the Trojans, no one stands out, virtually all of USC’s offense has proven its worth this season.
While Kurzeka and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic lead the team with 33 and 28 goals this season, respectively, it is not unusual to see many different Trojan players score for USC in a single game. In USC’s 21 games this season, only its game against Stanford on Oct. 2 saw less than five different players score.
“With our team you never know who is gonna turn up for the day and be the star,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “In the past different guys have been our go to players, whether it is Toby [Preuss], Kostas [Genidounias], Peter [Kurzeka], Nikola [Vavic]. Across the board we are a dangerous team so that is the key to our success. This Friday no doubt somebody will step up.”
Kurzeka was quick to note the improvements the team has made since September.
“Our offense is a lot better than the beginning of the season, and I think our defense overall is a lot better,” Kurzeka said. “We have some games where we give up a little more goals than we need, but we are also playing on a tough schedule right now in the MPSF and teams have a whole week to prepare for us so they are attacking our defense well.”
The last five games the Trojans have played have been wins, but not up to their own standards in terms of goals against. They have not given up less than five goals since the end of October.
“The past few games we haven’t met our expectation of four goals or less so we will look to improve on that,” Dennerley said.
This season the Trojans’ opponents have been averaging 5.2 shots against per game. UCLA has been averaging 6.32 goals against.
Regardless of the Trojans’ defensive goals not being met, however, Friday’s game will truly be a clash of water polo titans.
USC is riding on a 10-game winning streak. UCLA boasts a nine-game streak of its own. The Trojans are averaging 12.05 goals per game this season, but the Bruins have a slight upper hand with their average of 12.36. Both teams boast powerful offensive players, so anticipation for an action-packed game is high.
Even with all these factors in play, USC will go into the game with only one thing on its mind, however: a victory.
“I feel pretty confident, we’ve had a good few weeks of training and I think we’re pretty energized,” Kurzeka said. “We know what’s at stake to finish conference play undefeated and to get a big win at their pool is going to be huge.”

USC women’s basketball coach Michael Cooper is a firm believer in playing against the nation’s top teams.
“My old saying is ‘In order to be the best, you got to play the best,’” Cooper said. “We’re going out and playing some of the best teams in the country.”
Going for two · Senior guard Jacki Gemelos looks to lead the USC to road victories against Nebraska and No. 11 Georgia this weekend. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
Last year Cooper’s squad took the same path, which led the Women of Troy to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament after missing out on the NCAA tournament.
Cooper points to nonconference losses to Xavier and Princeton as the marks on last year’s schedule that deflated USC’s chances to make the Big Dance.
But that didn’t stop him from assembling another nonconference plate chock full of tough road games that starts this weekend against Nebraska and No. 11 Georgia.
His players are embracing the challenge.
“We need to get credit and show who we are,” senior guard Ashley Corral said. “It helps us in the future, so when we get those wins we’re used to playing on the road in front of big crowds in tough games.”
USC will have plenty of chances to get signature wins this season with nonconference matchups against No. 6 Texas A&M and No. 2 Notre Dame, last year’s national champion and runner-up, respectively.
The Women of Troy also have a chance to play No. 8 Duke in a tournament over Thanksgiving break in the Bahamas, and, as always, there are the two conference matches against No. 5 Stanford, who made the Final Four last year.
“We like [playing on the road],” sophomore forward Cassie Harberts said. “It’s a lot of fun playing in front of fans, even if they’re not rooting for you.”
Their first chance to win in a hostile environment comes Friday against the Cornhuskers (2-0), who have averaged 97 points per game while allowing only 48 points in their wins over Arkansas Pine-Bluff and Mississippi Valley State.
Nebraska has seven players averaging nine points or more, including four that are averaging double figures.
Sophomore forward Jordan Hooper has played an average of just 18.5 minutes per game through their first two contests but leads the Huskers with 19.5 points and 8.5 rebounds.
The Women of Troy will travel to Athens on Sunday to take on the Bulldogs, who made the Sweet 16 last season.
Georgia opened with an 83-60 victory over TCU last Friday, then beat Georgia Southern 68-49 on Tuesday. They will also host College of Charleston on Thursday before playing USC.
The Women of Troy beat Georgia 71-63 last year at the Galen Center, and both teams return four starters from last year’s squads.
Guard Khaalidah Miller leads Georgia with 16.5 points per game and is one of four Bulldogs averaging at least 13.0 points.
Both of USC’s opponents this weekend exhibit faster-paced offenses and press defenses, and Harberts says the Women of Troy will have to play better than they did in their season opener against Fresno State.
“We can’t come out down 11-0 on the road against these really good teams,” Harberts said, referring to USC’s early struggles in their season opener. “They’re going to be really tough, [and] we’re not going to get any calls, so we just need to come out and play our game.”
But the team is confident they will be ready for the faster tempo.
“They’re going to get in close and press us fullcourt,” senior guard Jacki Gemelos said. “But it’s something we’re ready for. We’ve prepared this week and done a really good job against our [practice squad] with the pressure.”
USC tips off against Nebraska on Friday at 7 p.m., and faces the Bulldogs at 2 p.m. on Sunday.

The No. 1 USC women’s volleyball team has stayed focused throughout conference play, rarely letting any team rattle the Women of Troy on their quest to exact revenge upon UCLA in the season finale after losing in straight sets in the conference opener at home.
Leaving her mark · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter will play in her final home matches donning the cardinal and gold this weekend. She needs just 30 kills to tie USC’s all-time record of 1,799 set by Jennifer Kessy. - George Chearswat | Daily Trojan
Before USC gets that chance, it has just one more weekend to get through.
The Women of Troy (22-4, 17-2) face Arizona State and Arizona Friday and Saturday in their final home matches of the regular season, as USC tries to cling to its slim one-game Pac-12 lead over the Bruins ahead of its showdown against UCLA on Nov. 25.
The Bruins slipped up last weekend against Oregon, and USC leap-frogged their crosstown rivals to top the conference standings and the national rankings.
“Going at this one match at a time, trying to get better each match, is really the only way to approach this,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We’ve been very good about staying focused on Arizona and Arizona State.”
But he does admit the thought of the season finale could be creeping into his players’ minds.
“I’m sure there’s a little anticipation for the Bruins because we played so badly against them last time, and we want to have another shot against those guys,” Haley said. “But that hasn’t come up.”
For that winner-take-all match to take place, USC will probably have to win at least one of their matches this weekend against the Arizona schools.
Arizona State (8-19, 4-14), which Haley has called “the scariest team in the Pac-12” is currently riding its first three-game winning streak of the season.
The Sun Devils rank in the bottom half of nearly every statistical category in the Pac-12, but do boast sophomore libero Stephanie Preach, who leads the conference with 5.21 digs per set, and sophomore outside hitter Ashley Kastl, who ranks seventh with 3.93 kills per set.
“Arizona State has been giving everybody fits,” Haley said. “Their coach [Jason Watson] has got them going for it every night.”
The Women of Troy beat the Sun Devils earlier this season on the road, but Arizona State did manage to steal a set.
They are the only Pac-12 team besides UCLA to have not been swept by USC this season.
Arizona (17-10, 9-9) will hope to earn that distinction as well on Saturday night, which is also USC’s Senior Night.
The Wildcats are on the bubble of qualifying for the NCAA tournament and will be looking for a big win to add to their resume.
Freshman Madi Kingdon leads Arizona with 3.42 kills per set, which ranks 10th in the Pac-12.
“They had a little dip because [Kingdon] got hurt for a little while, but I think she’s back to being healthy now,” Haley said. “So I think they’re going to be back at full force. [Kingdon] is the one you really have to deal with.”
Haley is expecting a big crowd for Senior Night with Galen Center officials letting everyone in for free Saturday before the match to watch the football team’s big game against Oregon on the overhanging scoreboard.
Senior All-Americans outside hitter Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bateman and middle blocker Lauren Williams will also be honored before the start of Saturday night’s game.
Both games this weekend start at 7 p.m.

Prior to tipoff, San Diego mayor Jerry Sanders was arm-in-arm with face-painted college students, jumping while in the front row of the stands leading the popular “I believe that we will win” chant.
Behind Sanders, a rowdy and intimidating crowd packed into Viejas Arena, where San Diego State has won all of their first three home games.
The Trojans, who only had one player available who had even started a road game at USC — sophomore guard Maurice Jones — fell in its first game of the season outside of the Galen Center, 56-54, despite a furious late-game comeback.
With the Trojans (1-2) trailing 54-45, sophomore forward Garrett Jackson made back-to-back three-point shots to bring USC within three points. On the next offensive possession, Jones banked in a deep 3-point shot to tie the score at 54 with 6.8 seconds left in the game.
Sophomore guard Xavier Thames drove the length of court for the Aztecs (4-1) and laid the ball in with 1.8 seconds remaining to give San Diego State the lead. The Trojans failed to get a final shot off before time expired.
Jones led the Trojans with 15 points and made 3 of 4 shots from beyond the arc. Jackson had 13 points off the bench, and junior forward Aaron Fuller added 12 points and seven rebounds.
Jackson entered the game midway through the first half and proceeded to shoot an air ball on his first three-point attempt. He remained confident, and made jump shots on USC’s next two offensive possession, finishing with six first-half points.
Fuller added 10 first-half points to help the Trojans go into halftime with a 25-21 lead.
Junior center James Blasczyk limped off court in the first half with what appeared to be an ankle injury but returned in the second half.
The Trojans return to the Galen Center to play Cal Poly on Saturday.
The Mustangs (1-1) return four starters from a squad that went 15-15 last season.
Senior guard Amaurys Fermin paces Cal Poly with an average of 15.5 points per game through two contests, and senior forward Will Taylor adds 14 points per game.
The Mustangs are more experienced, starting three seniors and a junior, but the Trojans have a significant height advantage. Taylor, at 6-foot-7, is Cal Poly’s tallest starter, while USC opens with Dedmon, who stands at seven-feet, and brings 7-foot-1 junior center James Blasczyk off the bench.
Tip-off is scheduled for 1:00 p.m., the earliest home start time of the season.

Practice for No. 18 USC was a little bit louder than usual on Thursday morning. In fact, “Mighty Oregon,” the university’s fight song, blared as the offense and defense took the field to take part in the Trojans’ last practice before Saturday’s huge matchup with the Ducks.
Tough test · Senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou is part of a USC front-seven that will try to slow down Oregon’s ground game. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans have been emulating the loud Autzen Stadium all week in an effort to simulate what it will be like playing in such a loud environment. Senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou knows it will be hard to hear his teammates, even those standing right next to him.
“As close as [he was standing next to me as I interviewed him] we’d have to be screaming to hear each other,” Tupou said. “It says a lot about their crowd.”
The loud crowd of around 59,000 at Autzen Stadium will not be the only thing the Trojans have to worry about; the Ducks own the fifth-best running game in the country, averaging almost 300 yards per game. As an offense, they average close to 47 points per game.
“[They’re] just fast paced. They’re [going to] come out, no huddle, they feed off their crowd. They’re just explosive,” Tupou said.
Coming off a big win against Washington, the Trojans are feeling confident in their defense.
“In terms of what went well … we kept it all about us,” Tupou said. “It was a big game for us, but our mentality wasn’t set on that; it was set on doing things right on the practice field.”
Tupou said that the key to slowing down Oregon is to play sound, mistake free football.
“You just gotta play good football. There’s no ‘stop that one guy’,” Tupou explained. “You gotta play well on all three levels: D-line, linebackers and [defensive backs] … You gotta be assignment perfect.”
Tupou explained that to stop Oregon’s explosive offense that includes quarterback Darron Thomas and running back LaMichael James at its core, all the key components he listed must be performed in tandem.
“If you wanna call yourself a great defense, that’s what you gotta do,” he said.
Though this is another nationally televised game for the Trojans, they are not caught up in the hype surrounding the contest. To Tupou, this is another game, and every game is to be treated the same: as a “must-win.”
“Just like Minnesota was in game one, this is game 11,” Tupou said. “It’s a must win; every game’s a must win.”
Why would we stoop to playing their damn fight song….ugh, it’s so vulgar when they do it.  Good Lord.

More than an hour after USC’s triple-overtime defeat against Stanford on Oct. 29, senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou lingered around an empty Trojans’ locker room.
As he put on his street clothes and finally headed out into the Los Angeles night, USC’s venerable defensive leader did something few are prone to do following a heartbreaking loss. He flashed a wide grin as if to let everyone around him know that everything would be all right.
“They’re no Lombardi speeches necessary,” Tupou said. “If you’re not excited to play another game there’s something wrong with you.”
Over the last 23 games, this Trojan football team has played with that mentality and that appreciation every snap.
In wins and in losses, in good times and in bad, in the Coliseum or in Notre Dame Stadium, the message hasn’t wavered: Continue to move the dark clouds that have hovered since NCAA sanctions were imposed in June 2010.
Though it’s been implied that all this team can play for these last two years is pride because of the postseason ban, I beg to differ.
Those dark clouds can’t be moved simply by playing the “we are all in this together” card. It’s a start, but it takes more than a simple glib mantra to change the culture.
This team is playing for respect, they are playing to put this program back among the elite, they are playing to remind people that tradition doesn’t just fade away in the face of adversity.
So in all honesty, Saturday’s monumental showdown with No. 4 Oregon at Autzen Stadium is more than just an opportunity to play the underdog role. Sure, an upset against a team who still has a chance to go to the BCS National Championship Game would make for a Hollywood-esque story.
But Saturday’s game presents something much greater.
It’s a chance to erase two years of pain, of frustration, of being written off.
It’s a chance on national television to give an entire country of nay-sayers a big “How do you like them apples?” from the all but forgotten corner of the college football landscape.
Or as sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey put it,“[A win] would mean USC is back, it’s as simple as that.”
So why not now for the Trojans?
Why can’t this game be the culmination of a two-year journey down the path of restoration?
The numbers suggest Oregon isn’t that different from the high-flying No. 1 team that came to Los Angeles last year and confidently defeated the Trojans in a 53-32 beat down.
The headlines will read that the Nike-nurtured Ducks have arguably the best offensive freshman in the country in former Crenshaw High star De’Anthony Thomas (150.67 all-purpose yards per game and 12 touchdowns).
The questions will be asked about whether or not Monte Kiffin’s old school Tampa-2 can even last on the same field against Chip Kelly’s almost unstoppable spread offense.
Throw in the fact that a USC team hasn’t won in the state of Oregon since 2005, and on paper the matchup seems to be pretty one-sided.
But if you look at this contest as a game of black and white, won and lost on paper, you’ll miss something.
If 2011 has taught us anything, it’s that this cardinal and gold-clad group doesn’t care about numbers or rankings or outside chatter.
They care about each other, about defending their oft-criticized coach with their on-field performance and about illustrating the transformation they’ve made both as individuals and as part of something greater than themselves.
“I feel that the way we are playing right now, we can give [Oregon] the best matchup since I’ve been here,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “I’ve mentioned before that there is a lack of individuals on this team, we have a sense of unity. And I think you can see that with the way we’ve played.”
Though it would be easy to try and quantify the Trojans’ chances on Saturday, it’s impossible to do because this team’s identity hinges on more than just a Robert Woods’ bubble screen, a Marqise Lee leaping grab, a Curtis McNeal scamper down the sideline or a Robey game-changing interception.
It’s an identity that has been built on belief when believing in the process seemed foolish.
It’s an identity that has proven time and time against these last few months, that bright lights serve only as a backdrop and not as a daunting challenge.
And, from where this team, this program and this university has come from in the last 18 months, can a 60-minute football game in front of 50,000 rowdy fans even compare to the obstacles left behind?
I don’t think so.
So, why not now for the Trojans?

USC last won in the state of Oregon in 2005.

Much has changed since then. Both coaching staffs have been overhauled. Oregon has won consecutive conference titles, while USC serves the second year of its postseason ban. In short, both teams seemed to be headed in opposite directions.
The two teams are set for a collision course Saturday in a nationally televised primetime matchup. No. 18 USC (8-2, 4-2) has won five of its last six contests, while No. 4 Oregon (9-1, 7-0) has reeled off nine straight wins since losing to No. 1 LSU in early September.
“[Oregon is] probably the hottest team in the country especially if you put them in their place,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I don’t know that anybody could tell you that there’s a better team right now, when they play at home, than Oregon Ducks. So it’s an awesome challenge for us and we’re excited to go up there.”
At Autzen Stadium, Oregon has won 21 consecutive home games. This season the average margin of victory for the Ducks at home is 31 points.
Its offense is a big reason why as Oregon ranks third nationally, averaging 46.7 points per contest, and ninth nationally in total yards with 498.3 per game.
“For the most part since the opener, really nobody has slowed them down for an entire game,” Kiffin said. “They do it at times. Now we have to find a way to put it together and rotate a bunch of guys in there and keep our gaps and not let the ball get out in space.”
Quarterback Darron Thomas and tailback LaMichael James lead Oregon’s offense. Thomas has thrown for 1,704 yards and 22 touchdowns this year. James leads the nation with an average of 150.9 rushing yards per contest, and has tallied 1,207 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Ducks’ other tailback, De’Anthony Thomas, committed to the Trojans early before wavering on his decision and choosing Oregon. Thomas has totaled 789 yards from scrimmage, recording 12 touchdowns. With so many weapons on offense and the speed at which Oregon plays, the coaching staff realizes that its defense will face a tough task.
“You see the tempo on tape and hear about it, but you really have to play against it in person,” assistant coach Monte Kiffin said. “They’re so good and they’re so explosive and do so many things, but you can’t stop everything. You have to be sound in what you do and hopefully [we] can slow them down.”
Though Oregon boasts one of the most prolific offenses in the nation, the USC defense has come alive of late. In three of the Trojans’ last four matchups, they have allowed fewer than 20 points and fewer than 270 yards of total offense. USC has also shut down the running game, allowing opponents to rush for just 88 yards per contest in its last five contests.
“We have a lot of confidence going into this game,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “But this offense is very talented with a lot of explosive guys. We have to get lined up because of the fast-paced offense and we have to have a sense of urgency at all times.”
USC’s defense might be clicking, but its offense has also been a strong point of the team all season. More recently, the Trojans’ running game has performed well, totaling more than 200 rushing yards in three of their last four games. Junior tailback Curtis McNeal has been a key reason for USC’s recent success via the ground, totaling more than 100 yards in three of his last four games. With the play of the offensive line and the tailbacks as of late, the coaching staff understands establishing the running game on the road will be key for the Trojans’ offense.
“It’s important,” running backs coach Kennedy Polamalu said. “[Oregon is] the leading rusher in our conference. They run the ball well and that’s their success. We have to at least bring our best up there, make sure we can run and be efficient. If we’re effective and efficient, it will help us.”
USC’s success running the ball has alleviated some pressure from the passing game, although the Trojans have not had to throw the ball much in their last two games. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley finished just 18-of-28 for 174 yards and one touchdown against Washington and his top target, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, recorded just two receptions for five yards. Woods, however, has been dealing with a nagging shoulder and ankle injury and could sit out Saturday’s game after not practicing all week.
“He’s going the wrong direction,” Kiffin said. “If we just keep practicing him, even though we limited his practice, he’s not getting better. He’s just worn down and the kid is trying to do everything that he can. A lot of kids wouldn’t even be playing right now, but he just keeps throwing himself back in there.”
If Woods were to sit out, Barkley still has plenty of other weapons to choose from, including freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, junior wide receiver Brice Butler, and tight ends redshirt freshman Randall Telfer and freshman Xavier Grimble.
“We have a great team and we have guys willing to step up,” junior left tackle Matt Kalil said. “We have a lot of depth and talent. We’re playing great, but we have to keep doing that and get after it [on Saturday].”
Though faced against a top-five team in the nation, the players are not backing down and have a positive outlook about Saturday’s game, especially with the progression the team has made throughout the season.
“We have a lot of respect for this team,” Telfer said. “They have a great offense, but we’re very confident in our defense as well. As the season has progressed, our camaraderie is a lot stronger and we’re definitely coming together as a unit. Hopefully we can come home with the win.”
Kickoff is at 5 p.m. and the game will be televised on ABC.

When people reflect on the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, that’s mostly what they recall, too.
A Perfect Haze: The Illustrated History of the Monterey International Pop Festival, by Harvey and Kenneth Kubernik — brothers infused with the spiritual fury of rock‘n’roll — chronicles the moment in musical history that, perhaps, demanded the most attention.
The Kuberniks have been compiling information — interviews, artifacts and photographs — about the festival since 1997. Their interest in Monterey dates back to 1968, when documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker released his film Monterey Pop, which Harvey Kubernik saw on a date as a teenager.
The Kuberniks’ book is a comprehensive study of the festival that helped solidify rock‘n’roll music’s impact on the consciousness and pulse of the United States and the world in the middle of the 20th century.
The book, which is much more than just a coffee table read, details the myths of our greatest rock‘n’roll shamans: Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding, for example. And it gives remarkable attention to the culture of the audience, the offstage moments and the production of the epic event.
The Kuberniks secured never-before-seen images, such as Janis Joplin walking her dog, that uncover random moments in the lives of significant American musicians of the 20th century and highlighted how rock stars used to sit among notable festival attendees (The Rolling Stones’ Brian Jones and Warhol/Velvet Underground associate Nico in thrall with someone else’s act, for instance).
Interviews with audience members and scans of actual telegrams sent from the managers of bands, like Jefferson Airplane, narrow the scope of the festival to moments of humanity that fill in the abstract concept of the 1960s rock festival. Who knew rock‘n’roll had time and energy for telegrams?
The modern rock fan is too often led down a road of inaccessibility; they are trained by the way contemporary culture relates to famous people or made to believe talented musicians have access to a level of soul or mind that is above and beyond him or her. What the Kuberniks’ book shows is how the original spirit of rock‘n’roll served to include everyone in the bliss.
Popular music in the ’60s encouraged a communal spirit. The music’s goal was to tune everyone in to the blues of a guitar, the aesthetics of stage antics and the colors music can create in the mind. The book illustrates that the Monterey Pop Festival harnessed the opportunities that this music presented and shifted how human beings relate to albums and live shows.
The form of a concert was extended into a theater show and spiritual experience in addition to an artistic performance. It wasn’t perverted by any sort of public obsession with larger-than-life personalities, and it certainly didn’t need to beg you to feel something. There are no photos of fans screaming for autographs, nor does there seem to be any sort of security force protecting performers from audience.
The festival was about finding something new — a new way to look at life, love and art. Its power lies in the fact that it’s one of the few American events in the last hundred years that didn’t celebrate myths.
More than anything, the unique aspects of the book accurately paint rock‘n’roll phenomena as a truly involved process. There are color pictures of The Doors at the Mount Tam Festival, a precursor to Monterey and Woodstock, before “Light My Fire” brought them enormous acclaim. The Doors did not merely explode in popularity and turn into legends. These pictures show them on their steady climb.
A Perfect Haze shows, in scrapbook form, the genesis of the Summer of Love, a cultural movement that turned the tide of American identity.
Readers discover the intricate webs of this historical moment. The snapshots of moments like Jimi Hendrix shopping for flowers or Art Garfunkel watching a show have such a level of documentary realism that flipping through this book is like taking a stroll through festival grounds.
The Kuberniks’ intent in the aesthetic of this book seems to have been geared toward providing a portrait of Monterey from a primary source perspective. The oral history interviews that make up the text transcend any form of secondhand reporting. They let the festival speak for itself by being the sum of multiple first-person accounts from musicians, organizers, documenters and festival attendees alike.
And, like the moment itself, the festival sees no need to invent its own worth or beauty — it has absolutely nothing to do with myths.
sounds like a great book! i was on the east coast at the time so i missed the show, but heard a lot of stories from friends who lived in monterey when i worked there. i’m ordering a copy right now!

It’s hard to think of original ideas in Hollywood these days. New ideas might earn critical jabs, or they might never make a ripple. One way to stack the deck in a film’s favor is to take the subject from something people already have some familiarity with, such as a famous singer or sports figure.
Legendary figures · Biopics, like J. Edgar, hold the exciting potential to portray historical figures accurately or glamorously. - Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
 
From this leaning springs the biopic, where people who live larger than life get a shot at celluloid immortality — and even the chance to be played by Oscar-hungry celebrities.
In Clint Eastwood’s latest film, J. Edgar, Leonardo DiCaprio plays the ferocious, first director of the FBI, John Edgar Hoover, a lawyer who tangled with everyone from Commies to gangsters. Though the movie received mixed reviews, biopics are still a strong genre, with upcoming features including Steven Spielberg’s take on Abraham Lincoln, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, and not one but two films about the Victorian socialite Effie Gray, played by Keira Knightley and Dakota Fanning.
Many biopics go on to rake in Oscars, such as Sean Penn’s best actor win for 2008’s Milk. Others, however, get lambasted for everything from historical inaccuracies to rampant self-indulgence, such as director Oliver Stone’s messy Alexander.
A few commonalities, however, exist. First, the main character has to be epic. Elizabeth Bathory and Emperor Nero might fit this bill, but in American film, the main character needs to be conflicted rather than outright evil.
To hone in on inner turmoil, producers often turn to musicians. From drugs to murder, most famous musicians have something scandalous in the mix. Walk the Line, the 2005 film about music legend Johnny Cash, focused on the actor’s tumultuous relationships with women and drugs. 2004’s Ray, about Ray Charles, told the iconic pianist’s journey from a child stricken with blindness to a conqueror of Carnegie Hall. If typical marriage spats aren’t gripping enough, 1986’s Sid and Nancy followed Sex Pistols’ bassist Sid Vicious from his turbulent stage life to the day he woke up to find his girlfriend stabbed to death beside him.
But for these affecting stories of human turmoil to work and to not reduce an audience to titters, the actor has to have the chops for it. For this reason, biopics almost always feature a star — Walk the Line had Joaquin Phoenix, Ray had Jamie Foxx, and Sid and Nancy had Gary Oldman. It’s a win-win, as these actors often get an Oscar nomination as recompense for all the emotional torment.
Biopics must also master the dance between historical accuracy and creative license. Too little attention to facts usually alienates history lovers. It also gives the impression the director had little respect for the material or did not understand the time period. A film that somehow rose above the mountains of inaccuracies to succeed on a critical level was Amadeus, which invented a bitter rivalry between Mozart and composer Antonio Salieri — but success in this form is rare.
Conversely, sticking leech-close to history causes its own problems. Real life is full of dull moments, character inconsistencies and anticlimaxes. To work as a film, there has to be a compromise. Otherwise the film winds up like 2003’s Gods and Generals — not quite a biopic, but a film that closely followed the last years of General Stonewall Jackson. The film was wonderfully accurate, but it was four hours long and made audiences think the South went on to die at Gettysburg only to escape useless speeches.
Shekhar Kapur’s 1998 Elizabeth was less accurate but a much better film. Cate Blanchett took Queen Elizabeth’s inexperienced youth and honed it to a quietly ferocious edge. More so than listing facts, the film allowed audiences to see the precariousness of the young queen’s position and the forces of will it took to overcome political machinations and religious feuds. Even if the facts aren’t straight, the mood is.
Tying all these aspects together is a common thread often overlooked in mincing over accuracy or characterization, a successful biopic must never forget to be a solid, entertaining film. To succeed, a biopic must never forget it is a film. No matter the power of the original story or the perfect recreations of 16th-century tableware, it means nothing if the film is poorly shot, structured or edited. A musician’s biopic usually at least guarantees a good soundtrack, but films like Walk the Line succeed because they are good films first and biographies second. Elizabeth’s sequel, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, was less successful than its prequel despite its heftier budget largely because it spent more time on burning ships and panning shots than character development.
It is said the victors write history, but biopics can serve to illuminate lesser known historical figures or undervalued greatness. More so, biopics give a face to names in a history book and a soul to god-like legends. At the very least, biopics might inspire children to pay more attention in history class.

Poet Amiri Baraka prefaced his performance Wednesday night with a 20-minute talk on the state of the world through the scope of African-American culture.
Sage speaker · Amiri Baraka’s controversial and thought-provoking poetry entails a blend of avant-garde content that reflects his background as well as the obstacles of African-Americans throughout history. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
 
Baraka came to USC for a Visions & Voices event to showcase his poetry and to spark conversation.
Baraka said his appearance at the university followed his visits to a number of cities across the country, namely Sacramento and “black Los Angeles.”
When Baraka is in a room, it seems like he’s about to set it on fire with thoughts and proclamations (not to mention his poetry), most of which relates to the struggle of African-Americans throughout history.
“If you haven’t read the stories of your own folk, then you’re not educated,” he said.
He related his experiences of encountering “the two greatest people” he’d ever had the opportunity to meet: Malcolm X, who he met a month before his murder, and Martin Luther King Jr., who he met a mere 10 days before King’s assassination.  The message he received from both these figures was the same: Struggle against oppressive forces must be a united front of all people who are oppressed, of all cultures and creeds.
Baraka impressed upon the audience, especially the students and faculty, that “part of what you do has to be to save this country.”
Baraka creates his art from a deep personal scope, infused with his background growing up in the ethnic battleground of Newark, N.J. He said that art has to come from people’s lives and that the artist must seek to include as much of the “real” world in that as possible.
Never does the air get so quietly thin as when Baraka talks about blacks’ current situation in this country, where he reveals a true brilliance and no apprehensions about being controversial.
He criticized President Barack Obama for his part in the recent NATO bombings on Libya, which Baraka labeled “disgraceful” for its hypocrisy: a black man bombing his own homeland by assisting the two greatest arch-colonist powers in the history of the world in England and France.
But he said that he still and has always supported Obama’s re-election because of fears of an America run by Rick Perry, Mitt Romney or any other Republican candidate.
He related a theory that black people, whenever they overcome something and get new freedom, are forced to face a new oppression (as evidenced by an analogy between the Ku Klux Klan’s rise after the abolition of slavery and the uprising of the Tea Party following Obama’s 2008 election).
“I’m going to read some poetry to keep my license,” Baraka said after this lengthy political discussion.
Baraka’s poetry reflects an original mix of the avant-garde literary movements of the 20th century like the beat generation, jazz poetry and the Harlem Renaissance. Baraka himself associated with the bohemians of Greenwich Village, N.Y. and he’s often grouped into the circle that included Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and countless other poets who used literature as an automatic, musical outlet formatted as similar to bebop.
His poetry works on many levels: political, musical, free-form, spoken word, imagistic. It’s no stretch to say that Baraka’s work is a precursor to rap and hip-hop.
One of Baraka’s most famous innovations with spoken word was his invention of a form of “African-American haiku” called “lowku.”
“We can’t count the syllables, we don’t have time, it’s just short,” he said.
One of the poems Baraka read was one considered his most controversial, “Somebody Blew Up America,” a response to 9/11. Many saw “Somebody Blew Up America” as anti-Semitic for its indictment of Israel, and for this reason Baraka was asked to resign from his position as poet laureate of New Jersey.
Following his reading, Baraka answered several questions from admirers and critics alike, including an 81-year-old man who professed a life-affirming appreciation and love for Baraka’s work.

At some point, we have all made the unbearable trek from Superior Grocers to our place of residence. As a resident of Cardinal Gardens, I make this trek frequently, and I admit I’ve cursed the distance and wished for either a car or more hands many times.
But there is something special about Superior. As a Spanish speaker, I find it a common ground, an intersection of cultures in one area.
When I learned Superior would inevitably be torn down to accommodate the new development plans for The Village at USC, I felt saddened and already nostalgic at the thought of losing this cultural gem.
My despondency grew when I learned there was going to be a Fresh & Easy built — all the way on Figueroa Street at University Gateway. The soon-to-be Fresh & Easy is a positive addition to USC, but not to the greater community.
Though the main focus of new university developments should partially be to students, the community at large should be considered heavily. In the case of Fresh & Easy, it was not.
Ralphs was recently involved in a lawsuit with the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office for 27 counts of overcharging customers for food.
It was also cited for similar violations in 2008 and 2009 and paid nearly $17,000 in fines.
So, Ralphs isn’t necessarily an affordable option.
Fresh & Easy might be less expensive, but are we willing to sacrifice serving the community for lower prices?
Our community is comprised of a large Latino demographic. Within that demographic are high rates of poverty. People in poverty might resort to either coupons, personal checks, The Women, Infants and Children’s Program, food stamps or EBT to pay for their groceries. Fresh & Easy, according to Poor magazine, doesn’t “take coupons, personal checks or WIC — and like their Whole Paycheck counterparts, they don’t hire union employees, or ultimately many employees at all, as they have the new self-pay check-out stands.”
So the argument that Fresh & Easy will create jobs is negated. The argument that Fresh & Easy will be better for the community is incorrect. It won’t be, since many members of the community won’t be able to use their resources in this market.
I’m all for low prices and convenience for students. But at the same time, we can’t forget about the community at large. Community residents are a part of this city and institution just as much as students are, so it’s unfair to leave them out when making new plans for supermarkets. After Superior is torn down, they won’t have many options.
An alternative would be to petition that Fresh & Easy permit the usage of coupons, personal checks and WIC to make sure both students and the community are served.

First of all, “the unbearable trek”? Come on, it’s just across the street! If someone said that coming from Parkside, that would be understandable, but I make that “trek” (if you can call it that) quite frequently from CarGar and it’s not bad at all for the average grocery trip. 
You know, I had my doubts about Superior at first. But this year, I have grown to love them. Do they have everything? No, but they have pretty much anything a college student needs. They also have a great Mexican bakery in the store that sells delicious pastries for a steal. And as far as quality, I haven’t had any issues with produce and what not.
And the people saying the community around ‘SC is terrible, welcome to L.A. Big cities have crime. There are great places like La Barca and La Paloma that are a testament to the culture around us, and frankly, saying the community sucks is extremely disrespectful to the people that live here.
And students wonder why USC is called “University of Spoiled Children.” Quit focusing on the negatives and enjoy the positives.
“Let me be blunt: the community here sucks”  Agreed, fully. The surrounding community contributes little but crime and disorder and detracts from the USC experience. I wish I were going to be here to see the day when the university finishes buying up the surrounding area and pushes the ghetto far, far away. On that day, the streets will be significantly safer, students won’t have to worry about getting mugged, and USC will be a far better school.
To Ms. Linton: Do you read the emails DPS sends out notifying us about all the crimes that occur around campus? That is the “community” you are trying to defend. It is crime-ridden and cancerous, and we should do everything in our power to drive it away.
Superior is a cesspool. It serves substandard, disgusting groceries. It is emblematic of the neighborhood surrounding USC. Tearing it down is the first step toward pushing that neighborhood away, and building a stronger, better Trojan community.
Thank god! Superior is awful. I’m all for affordable healthy food – its not like they are putting in a whole foods or Bristol farms…. I would love to see all of UV redone ~ it’s dead and a revamp would boost the local economy.
Both Superior and Fresh and Easy are check yourself out and bag your own.
They won’t be getting my business.
Seeing as how WIC is yet another government welfare wealth redistribution program funded on the backs of taxpayers, perhaps the author and others of her persuasion should voluntarily resdistribute their own wealth to the local community — that way, the impoverished locals can spend the donated cash they receive, avoiding the complications with WIC. Problem solved.
Good. Superior is a total dump that overcharges for substandard groceries. I welcome the addition of Fresh&Easy to University Gateway, as should anyone with half a brain. 
And by the way – Fresh&Easy started accepting WIC vouchers more than 18 months ago. Maybe you should do a little research before writing this NIMBY garbage.
You don’t want to shop at Fresh and Easy–shop somewhere else.
There are plently of small grocery stores in the area that cater to the local spanish speaking community. Enjoy!
On the other hand, for those of us that want to shop at Fresh and Easy–we are entitled. 
Lastly, we could leave the neighborhood as is or we could improve it. I guess you prefer the former.
Hey Mellissa check out this Fresh & Easy Buzz blog for a bunch of information about Fresh & Easy not taking WIC, coupons and so on. Think it’s where the magazine you mention got it. They talk about how because Fresh & Easy is losing money, taking WIC and coupons would actually be a benefit for its business. It tsays they take WIC at the store in south LA. They have a hard time accepting them and the coupons because have self-service checkout.

Let me be blunt: the community here sucks. I would much rather be someplace else. If they want to shop in dirty, old stores that don’t carry normal items that I value (e.g., Superior), then they should be able to. But my ability to purchase quality food should not be relegated for their benefit.
Superior is terrible and deserves to go. If you feel good about being able to speak Spanish in a grocery store, maybe you should get your priorities in order.
i disagree. There is a Fresh & Easy at 1025 E Adams Blvd. And they have been working hard to sell to the local community, which is probably more Latino then the local community around USC.
Thank God! Let us just be real here; the surrounding community was nothing to brag about. I am glad they are tearing down Superior. It was a cesspool when I was going to school at USC.
Superior was told that the UV was going to be torn down 3 or 4 years ago when Gateway was under construction and was given first choice to move there during construction and said no. If you look at the plans for the Village it does include a new grocery store, which will probably be superior.

Grocery shopping is a time-consuming and inconvenient activity for many USC students living on or around campus. With Superior Grocers a pretty unpopular choice and the more frequented Ralphs a half-mile away, students without immediate access to a car must walk to the store and struggle home lugging their groceries.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
 
For something as seemingly simple as grocery shopping, the lack of options in the immediate area surrounding USC has made shopping unnecessarily difficult.
With a new Fresh & Easy on its way to a spot underneath University Gateway, however, students will finally be able to get quality food easily.
Construction began Nov. 8, and it is expected to be completed as soon as December or January. Students will soon have a much easier and less stressful time with their grocery shopping.
As a major university in one of the world’s largest cities, it is surprising USC has only recently seen such commercial developments in the surrounding community that cater to its students.
Especially important for USC’s students is easy access to a trusted grocery store that exists for the purpose of serving students, the prior absence of which has inconvenienced students for far too long.
The new Fresh & Easy is a godsend for students already scatterbrained from jam-packed schedules, removing the burden of carefully planned trips to Ralphs.  It’s a welcome addition for those students who would prefer not to have to plan their days around grocery shopping.
Not everyone, however, is thrilled with the idea of the supermarket. Critics of the new Fresh & Easy argue that it would be a superfluous addition because of the presence of Superior in the University Village. Superior is popular among local residents, but some students have voiced their concerns.
Though the prices at Superior might be lower, the store was not built for students and thus does not necessarily provide the best grocery options for them. Just because it is there does not mean it has to be our only or most convenient option when it comes to grocery shopping and what we eat.
Superior has a devoted clientele that has likely been shopping there for years, so criticisms about Fresh & Easy potentially taking revenue from it would be incorrect, until its destruction when construction begins on the new U.V.
Relatively few students regularly buy their food from Superior, so Fresh & Easy would not take a significant number of customers away from them or do any damage to the local community.
The space at Gateway that will house the new grocery store could not have been better utilized.
Not only is University Gateway right next to campus and in proximity to most student housing, it is itself one of the most popular housing choices for students and a hub for students’ Yogurtland stops and late-night Freebirds runs. The addition of a Fresh & Easy is essentially the finishing touch on an already impressive retail collection.

The Gates Millennium Scholarship Program hosted two key figures Monday night: Larry Griffith Jr., Vice President of UNCF and Julie Kim, Director of Operations of UNCF.
The Gates Millennium Scholarship Program provides full-ride scholarships to 1,000 students each year for up to 10 years of funding, five years of undergraduate and five years of graduate studies. It is funded by a $1.6 billion grant from Bill and Melinda Gates. USC has some of the most Gates Scholars in the nation; there are currently 78 USC scholars, both undergraduate and graduate.
The UNCF — the United Negro College Fund — administers GMSP along with the American Indian Graduate Center Scholars, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund  and the Asian & Pacific Islander American Scholarship Fund.
When selecting from a pool of applicants, GMSP looks at both academic and non-cognitive indicators, according to Larry Griffith.
“We look at 12 dimensions of personality, character, determination, and other factors that show us if students have the ability to navigate the environment,” Griffith said. “Our goal is to connect students and keep them engaged in the program. We try to support their next steps.”
GMSP represents four major groups: African American, Asian Pacific American, Native American and Hispanic.
The Director of Operations, Julie Kim, discussed some updates that next year will bring. The institution portal will be online and electronic fund transfer will replace checks, Kim said. Kim also discussed various programs students can get involved in, including alternative spring breaks and conferences.
“GMSP is definitely more than just a scholarship. It funds up to five years of graduate study and seven different fields of graduate study including math, engineering, computer science, and public health,” said Linda Huynh, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention.

Unlike usual divorce cases wherein spouses depart from property or money, a Connecticut judge Wednesday ordered a divorcing couple to provide him with all their passwords to Facebook, Match.com and eHarmony.com.
New London District Superior Court Judge Kenneth Shluger issued the order after Stephen Gallion found incriminating posts from his wife Courtney about their children and family. According to United Press International, Gary Traystman, Stephen Gallion’s divorce lawyer, said the situation could show her inability to care for their children, which could help his client’s argument for full custody.
Forbes reported that Courtney immediately texted a friend and asked that person to change the passwords and delete some of her messages. That’s when Shluger issued an injunction preventing both Courtney and Stephen from deleting material and required both clients to provide their passwords.
According to The Daily News, Traystman said that Stephen had nothing to hide, but acknowledged it wouldn’t be easy for his client to see his wife communicating with new love interests on eHarmony.com and Match.com.
Interestingly, Judge Schluger’s orders violate Facebook’s privacy regulations in which users promise to “not share your password, let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.”

No. 18 USC (8-2, 5-2) travels to Eugene on Saturday as a 15.5-point underdog to face the No. 4 Oregon Ducks (9-1, 7-0). According to Michael Lev of the Orange County Register, the Trojans have not been this big of an underdog since 1998 when they traveled to Florida State. In addition the forecast calls for temperatures in the 30s with a high chance of showers.
Chip Kelly and Oregon do not need to worry about time of possession. The famed Quack Attack can score in an instant and match the pace of any high powered offense it faces. The secret to beating Oregon is limiting their number of possessions. It is a lot easier to score seven touchdowns when you have the ball twelve times instead of ten. As a result, USC must sustain drives and curtail the amount of chances the Ducks have to score.
The Trojans have shown the ability to light up the scoreboard the past few weeks, but the Ducks’ defense will likely be their stiffest test to date. Yet, there is reason for optimism: USC the best team in the country at avoiding 3-and-outs. Only 8.3 percent of their drives have ended after three plays. Moving the ball effectively over long periods of time will create a small margin for error on defense.
Will either team pressure be able to pressure the quarterback?
Ducks’ quarterback Darron Thomas has only completed 60.5 percent of his passes this season, and USC could cut Oregon drives short if it puts the Ducks passing situations on third down and then pressures Thomas to force incomplete passes or interceptions. By the same token, Oregon could disrupt the precision timing of Matt Barkley (66.8% completion percentage) and force him in to errant throws. Each team has done a fantastic job of protecting their quarterback to date. USC is third in the nation for sacks allowed (6), while Oregon is tied for sixth (7). Although USC has been slightly better at protecting the quarterback, Oregon has recorded nine more sacks that USC on the year and ranks fifth nationally.
How effective will Robert Woods be?
Robert Woods, a finalist for the Biletnikoff award given to the best receiver in the nation, sat out practice Thursday with injuries to his shoulder and ankle. Wednesday, head coach Lane Kiffin announced that Woods would not play unless he showed the ability to explode off of the line of scrimmage and beat coverage. Despite Kiffin’s comments, all signs point to the sophomore sensation playing. “I feel good to go,” Woods told reporters on Thursday. “I feel like I need to be there Saturday to help this team.” However, it remains to be seen how effective Woods will be. Playing with an assortment of injuries last Saturday, he only managed two catches for five yards.
Is there a way to stop either team’s rushing attack?
Since the season opening loss to LSU, the Oregon rushing attack has gashed defenses to the tune of 313.7 yards per game on the ground. The lethal combination of LaMichael James, Kenjon Barner, and DeAnthony Thomas in a spread offense creates problems for defenses in the open field. James, a junior from Texarkana, leads the Pac-12 in yards per carry (7.9) and ranks 6th nationally. If USC hopes to slow down Oregon, it will need to: win the battle at the line of scrimmage and get penetration, stay disciplined and stick with assignments, and tackle well in space.
While the Ducks boast arguably the best running attack in the country, the Trojans enter Saturday with an impressive back of their own. Redshirt junior Curtis McNeal ranks second in the Pac-12 in yards per carry (7.0) and ranks 13th nationally. He set a career high with 148 yards in the Trojans’ most recent contest against Washington on 18 carries.
For the season, USC’s run defense (100.4 yards per game) ranks 10th nationally. Meanwhile, Oregon has allowed 143 yards per game (49th nationally).
