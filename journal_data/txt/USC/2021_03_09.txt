In honor of International Women’s Day, President Carol Folt hosted a Herstory event Monday, opening up the celebration by sharing how the women in her own life have inspired her through their resilience, compassion and creativity. 
“We all have heroes and role models around us,” Folt said. “In my own life, I can think of my mother and her mother and all those who came before them, and I can think of my daughter and her daughter and all those who will come after them. And I think of my many colleagues and my students over the years, intelligent strong women working alongside me in labs and in administrative roles and as academic leaders.”
The event, hosted over Zoom, emphasized this year’s International Women’s Day theme #ChooseToChallenge, a theme that encourages individuals to highlight women’s achievements and challenge gender bias and inequality. Over the course of the celebration, 10 different Trojan students and alumnae shared their stories, bringing in their diverse perspectives and experiences as women in STEM, business, politics, athletics and the arts. 
Before jumping into the event, Folt called attention to women pioneers and heroes, including those who have not traditionally been remembered.
“Let’s also remember the many stories that were never told,” Folt said before introducing the first honored speaker, Hilda Solis. “The stories that were glossed over or simply overlooked. That’s what today is really about: lifting up and celebrating every story. Honoring its truth and embracing its lessons.”
A guidance counselor once said Solis was “not college material.” Years later, after graduating with a master’s in public administration from the Sol Price School of Public Policy and serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Solis became the United States Secretary of Labor under the Obama administration. Currently, she serves as the supervisor for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
Solis highlighted how significant women are worldwide and in L.A. County alone, where 5.1 million women and girls reside and nearly 60% of the people employed by the county are women. For the first time in the county’s history, the board of supervisors is composed of all women, she said. 
Yet, despite “women hold[ing] up more than half the sky in Los Angeles County,” as Solis put it, there is work to be done to combat the gender wage gap between women and men, as well as the social and environmental factors that impact women’s health.
Joyce Bell Limbrick, senior associate athletic director and senior woman administrator in the department of athletics, encouraged those attending the event — whether they identify as men, women or non-binary — to ask themselves how they would accept the call to support women in various ways. 
Whether it be by working to minimize the wage gap in their own workplace, supporting girls without access to higher education through school fees and tuition or buying from women-owned businesses, Limbrick emphasized the myriad ways people can directly contribute to the cause. 
“How or what will you challenge in support of women?” Limbrick asked. “Let today serve as the impetus in your challenge to barriers that exist for women in your circle, in this country and in the world, for we are all responsible in the fight for equality for women. How you choose to challenge is your decision, but what is most important is that you make sure your choice counts.”
One of the barriers many speakers at the event have worked to dismantle is the lack of women in leadership positions or traditionally “male” fields. 
Radhika Agrawal, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, shared how it felt to be the only woman on her robotics team in high school and how she would find herself researching before meetings in order to “prove [her] worth.” Over the years, she said she has heard many misconceptions that people have about women in her field, including quips about women who “only got that job because she’s a woman.”
“It’s not just me either,” Agrawal said. “Many of the women I’ve mentored and talked to have shared this sense of feeling the need to prove ourselves to our teammates.” 
Andrea Armani, the chair of chemical engineering and materials science at USC, shared her experience of being “the girl” throughout her academic training as well, but said when she joined the faculty her “world tilted on its axis” as she walked into a classroom that was nearly 50% women. In 2019, the Viterbi School of Engineering achieved gender parity, with women composing 50% of its entering class. 
“These students are role models for me, for this campus and also for the world,” Armani said. “This type of environment is really critical in order to catalyze innovation. Not only do scholars from different backgrounds bring unique concerns and experiences to the lab, into business, they often are able to connect ideas and concepts that had previously been overlooked or ignored.”
Mayor of Compton Aja Brown also highlighted the importance of amplifying female perspectives and leadership, asserting that “to omit women is to omit our collective advancement as human beings.” 
Brown brought up various pieces of research that have shown the benefits of including women in organizations and positions of leadership. She cited research that found having women in organizations leads to better problem solving and innovation from the diversity of thought, as well as reports that women are better at making deals in the Senate than their male counterparts. 
Nearly all of the speakers expressed that seeing women in leadership positions, breaking barriers and in their current roles, continues to inspire them. From senior neuroscience major Elizabeth Hannan finding a hero in her mother, to Brown finding a hero in Stacy Abrams and Agrawal finding a hero in Reshma Saujani — the first Indian American to run for Congress and the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code — themes of gratitude and reverence were expressed. 
Undergraduate Student Government President and Vice President-elects Alexis Areis and Lucy Warren said they were inspired by the first all-women ticket to run for USG president and vice president in 2015, Rini Sampath and Jordan Fowler. Areias said that when people expressed doubt in their ability to win with an all-women ticket, it was her confidence in Warren and their abilities, as well as her confidence in the student body for seeing them as more than their gender, that helped her remain certain she could do it. Her confidence was also inspired by Sampath and Fowler, she said.
“There was so much comfort in knowing that six years before us, two women took a leap that made our campaign all the more possible,” she said.
Warren said she and Areias want to continue normalizing having women in power. 
“The reality of it is, there are still challenges with the way that women in leadership are perceived,” Warren said. “We must work to normalize our positions in leadership and recognize that as great as these feats are, the real victory will be felt as soon as these conversations cease to be had.”
Tying up the event, Ange-Marie Hancock Alfaro, the chair of the political science and international relations department and upcoming Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Center for Leadership by Women of Color, thanked President Folt and other women leaders in the USC community for their leadership.
“Women belong everywhere people need quality air to breathe, art created, governments to run, businesses to found and families to inspire,” Hancock Alfaro said. “While today is International Women’s Day, remember that every day there is an opportunity to collaborate with, engage in leadership with and benefit from women here and abroad.”

The USC soccer team defeated both Oregon State and Oregon this weekend and are now 3-1 on the season.
After their first loss of the season against Arizona State last Friday, the USC women’s soccer team defeated Oregon State 2-0 in a dominant performance at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
Junior forward Penelope Hocking scored the game’s only two goals, including a score in the 88th minute to secure the victory for the Trojans. 
Oregon State had previously upset No. 3 ranked Stanford in Corvallis, Oregon by a score of 2-1. With the loss against the Trojans, the Beavers fall to 2-3 on the season while the Trojans improved to 2-1. The Beavers, who were averaging over two goals per game, went scoreless thanks to an impressive performance from the USC defense. 
“We had a few lapses, but all in all it was a pretty good performance by the group.” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. 
Junior Anna Smith got the start as goalkeeper for the Trojans and made her presence felt with a first half shutout. Redshirt senior Kaylie Collins was back in the goal for the second half, completing the team shutout by saving the Beavers’ only shot on goal. 
“We’ve got two really good goalkeepers,” McAlpine said. “It’s a luxury, not everybody has that.” 
Offensively, it was the dynamic duo of senior forward Tara McKeown and Hocking who made the difference for the Trojans. McKeown assisted Hocking’s first goal in the 18th minute off a diving steal from Oregon State’s junior goalkeeper Bridgette Skiba. 
Despite giving up two goals, Skiba had an impressive performance, with six saves off of several good looks from the Trojan offense. 
The Beaver offense conversely had a tough outing against a strong USC defense, only putting one shot on goal. In the 19th minute, sophomore forward Brianna McReynolds missed the game-tying shot in a one-on-one against Smith. 
After halftime the Trojans continued their aggressive offensive attacks, with 8 of their 13 shots coming in the second half. This continual offensive push gave the Beavers very few chances to tie the game with only three total shots in the second half. 
The game was all but over when Hocking secured her second goal of the day in a one-on-one play against Skiba. Hocking now has three goals on the season and is USC’s current leading scorer.
Following their victory against Oregon State, USC moved on to win against Oregon Sunday in a tough 1-0 match.
In the 12th minute, junior defender Kaylin Martin scored the only goal of the game with a header off the corner kick from senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo. This is the first goal for the defender who has played two games this season.
In the 44th minute, Oregon sophomore midfielder Maya Hahn delivered a strong corner kick that was defended well by Smith. The Trojan goalkeeper had one save in the first half, and her counterpart Collins had two saves in the second.
It was a standout game for Ducks freshman goalkeeper Leah Freeman, who is ranked No. 3 nationally. Despite allowing the first goal, she made four impressive saves to defend the Trojan’s strong attempts on goal. 
Both offensive sides were equally matched with the Trojans and Ducks attempting nine and eight shots, respectively. A strong defense resulted in a scoreless second half. 
“We did a really good job of just finding a way to get through the game,” McAlpine said. “Making it one where we took away their opportunities to get to goal.”
The Trojans play at Utah next. The Utes are 1-2-2 this season, and USC comes off a 2-1 win last season. However, they have not won an away game against the Utes since the 2000 season.
“Utah always gives us a tough game, they’re extremely well coached,” McAlpine said.
The Trojans kick off against Utah Friday at 4 p.m.

Women in the film industry face barriers when it comes to representation, equal pay and continued acts of sexual harassment and abuse. They are exposed to toxic and sexist environments and have to fight every step of the way to have their voices heard. Despite all the challenges women face, they continue to tell important stories and carve paths for themselves, subverting stereotypes along the way. To celebrate Women’s History Month, here is a curation of films featuring women directors, stories and characters that deserve recognition:
“Little Women” (2019)
Even if you haven’t read the book, Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s novel set in 19th-century Massachusetts is a universally heartwarming family tale. It is a coming-of-age story that delves into the trials and tribulations of growing up as a woman in society, featuring a star cast with the likes of Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep and Florence Pugh. Gerwig is one of five women in Hollywood’s history to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Director. Her repertoire, including the acclaimed film, “Lady Bird,” is full of coming-of-age stories and empowering women characters to add to your list or rewatch for the sixth time — whatever the case may be. 
“Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (2019)
A French historical romantic drama set in the late 18th century, the stunning visuals and slow buildup of passion is a celebration of women and their desires. A story of a forbidden lesbian romance that deals with taboo subjects such as abortions, class status and gender societal expectations — the film demonstrates the ways women fight to find their own happiness. Céline Sciamma’s movie is an artistic masterpiece that does not shy away from reminding us of women’s realities and sacrifices. 
“Kill Bill: Vol. 1” (2003)
Giving birth to one of the most iconic badass female leads, “The Bride,” Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” series may not be everybody’s cup of tea. But if you are unbothered by gory violence or other Tarantino-esque elements, it is a story about a woman standing up for herself and taking revenge against those who have wronged her. Uma Thurman delivers a praiseworthy performance, channeling the rage and aggression women are expected to suppress. 
“The Farewell” (2019)
Directed by Lulu Wang, “The Farewell” is based on Wang’s own experiences and depicts a Chinese American family organizing a gathering to say goodbye to matriarch Nai-Nai, the only person who does not know she has only a few months left to live. Written in both English and Mandarin, the film features a heartwarming performance by Awkwafina along with universal themes of family, culture and immigration.
“Wonder Woman” (2017)
Patty Jenkins’ “Wonder Woman” brings to life the first superhero movie directed by a woman starring Gal Gadot as Diana, the first woman superhero to get her own movie in the DC and Marvel universe. Breaking the ceiling for other women superheroes, the movie shows a compelling and unapologetic hero who genuinely wants to do good. The movie has been criticized for “not being feminist enough” due to its sexualization and objectification of Gadot. However, the filmmakers have insisted that the character is supposed to be a feminist icon making her own choices. Criticism aside, the movie is an inspiration to little girls worldwide that all women can be superheroes in their own might.   
“Persepolis” (2007)
Based on Marjane Satrapi’s autobiographical graphic novel, “Persepolis” is an animated biographical story of a young girl growing up during the Iranian revolution in the late 1970s. A joint Iranian-French production directed by Satrapi herself in collaboration with Vincent Paronnaud, the film is funny and tragic at the same time. While set during a challenging time period, the story itself gives us the viewpoint of a rebellious punk-loving teenage girl from a liberal-leaning family trying to come to terms with the unrest taking place around her, all the while finding pride in her culture and identity. 
“The Devil Wears Prada” (2006)
Giving birth to Meryl Streep’s role as the iconic Miranda Priestley, “The Devil Wears Prada” features a powerful, intimidating boss who is ambitious, clever and unafraid to sacrifice others to keep her position. While she is disliked by many, Priestley is a complex character who inspires awe despite being ruthless. She is a reminder that women often have to be ambitious in the workplace to maintain their authority. 
“Pitch Perfect” (2012)
A celebration of women friendships, the movie follows an all-women a capella college group “The Barden Bellas,” who go on to fight against the sexist and elitist world of acappella in the national championships to show that an all-women group can win the championship. They learn from past mistakes, break away from tradition and have fun while proving the misogynists wrong. Along the way, the women support each other and grow individually and collectively as they begin to trust each other.

Mar. 16 will mark one year since USC announced that instruction for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester would be carried out online. Though many students hoped for a return to campus come Fall 2020, virtual learning continued — even for students creating films.
For the School of Cinematic Arts’ students, the difficulties of a pandemic production environment revealed themselves rapidly. As the pandemic sprints toward its one year anniversary, SCA students continue to cope with the challenges of isolated creation.
Carolyn Knapp, a junior majoring in cinema and media studies with a minor in screenwriting, had just wrapped up shooting her short film, “Cherry Bomb,” when the pandemic hit Los Angeles. Instead of collaborating with her crew for post-production, everyone was sent into quarantine.
“Normally you would get pick-ups,” Knapp said. “You would go back in and get some shots that you could re-do or do better. That didn’t really happen.” 
Forced to work with what she had from the first round of shooting, Knapp’s next challenge was to overcome the mental setback that quarantine initiated among the film’s post-production crew. Whereas directors, editors and other crew would typically meet to collaborate on the editing process, the need to isolate meant that the entire post-production process had to be done remotely. 
While editing in quarantine was definitely “doable,” as Knapp said, it was more of a “mental delay” that slowed the process down. As the world shut down around them, editing the footage was no longer the first objective on anyone’s to-do list. 
“It kind of felt like, ‘OK, well great, we got this all, but this isn’t the biggest thing we’re worrying about right now,’” Knapp said.
Although Knapp delayed the post-production process, the boredom of early quarantine allowed for her to make one unexpected discovery: the marketing power of TikTok. 
Knapp had hoped for in-person screenings or cast parties to promote “Cherry Bomb,” but with everyone stuck scrolling through their phones in their childhood bedrooms, she had to come up with a strategy more feasible for quarantine, which meant promoting through the app. 
Given “Cherry Bomb’s” over twenty thousand views on YouTube, it appears that some filmmakers may have learned a successful tip or two from the pandemic. 
Knapp spent the summer honing her animation skills from home, since in-person limitations made further film production nearly impossible. However, as coronavirus numbers slowly drop and in-person production inches closer to becoming a reality again, Knapp is finding her way back onto set for smaller-scale projects and feeling grateful. 
“The mood on set is very thankful, almost. It’s like, ‘Whoa! We’re actually here doing this; this is crazy,’” Knapp said. “We’re not taking things like that for granted anymore.”  
Mila Danton, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies with a minor in screenwriting, was also able to find a silver lining amidst the frustrations of virtual film production. 
When Danton’s production class was forced to move online in Spring 2020, drastic changes were made to the way students produced their short films. After returning to their homes for quarantine, students who did not have access to their own personal equipment were told to shoot using their phones. 
While this would obviously decrease the quality that could have been achieved from borrowing SCA’s professional equipment, Danton recognized something inspiring from the situation.
“It kind of solidified the idea that anyone can make a movie,” Danton said. “Ultimately, if you want to tell a story, anyone can do it.”
Danton is telling her stories this semester through a production class that has adapted to have a more virtually-feasible layout. In “Advanced Genre Writing,” students work together to write a full-length feature script. 
In normal circumstances, the script is then produced the next semester in “Collaborative Directing for Film and Television.” However, given that in-person production is still extremely limited, the class was altered to produce a podcast instead. Danton is a co-director and co-head writer of the podcast. 
“We’re sort of doing everything on the back-end in terms of pre-production: planning storyboards, how we would choreograph all these scenes in terms of camera work and how we would cast and what the costume design would look like,” Danton said. “Up until the point that you can film. We do everything until that point.” 
Though the film will be adapted to a six episode podcast, the students still hold out hope that regular production will occur somewhere down the line, once it is safe to do so.
In the meantime, SCA is doing what they can to create a meaningful experience for students. The team creating the podcast is presenting their work to industry professionals and receiving feedback.
However, the critical element of in-person production remains lacking, and SCA students have not forgotten. 
“Human to human interaction is definitely something that makes filmmaking super impactful,” Danton said. “There’s something about the collaborative process of making movies and making television shows that is so fulfilling, and it’s definitely hard to find that when you have a screen in front of you versus being able to see the eyes of your colleagues.” 
While some courses have altered their formats in order to simplify production in a virtual setting, others are sticking to their original designs. Frank Ding, a transfer student majoring in film and television production, has had to cope with being a cinematographer over Zoom meetings. 
“It was really challenging, slow and limiting to try explaining ideas over Zoom,” Ding said. “Controlling the camera with just speech is a lot more difficult and slower than it sounds. You couldn’t just be like, ‘Move it left. Move it right. Move it up a little bit. Pan down,’ … it’s just super slow … at some points we had to resort to drawing diagrams to explain angles and lighting.”  
The SCA filmmaking community has discovered some tricks to make virtual production slightly easier, such as HDMI capture cards, which allow students to plug their cameras directly into Zoom. But as Ding explained, these solutions can’t sufficiently minimize the difficulties students face while producing from separate spaces. 
As a transfer student whose first semester at USC was Fall 2020, Ding has only experienced SCA in a virtual setting. Despite this seemingly disheartening start to his Trojan experience, Ding maintains his belief in the quality of SCA’s educational value. 
“I’m just still learning how to better take advantage of everything we have access to,” Ding said. “We have industry professional professors. I could always be reaching out to them for career advice, feedback on personal projects, or even school projects, and building important long term relationships and mentorships.”  
Even SCA professors have noticed that the drive to create has continued in their students, despite the obvious hardships of the situation. 
Kathleen Dowdey has been teaching “Practicum in Television Production” for two years, a course where students work together to produce television segments for Trojan Vision, USC’s student-run television station. The course, which specializes in live multi-camera production, was extremely difficult to adapt to a virtual setting. 
Dowdey and other instructors met virtually over summer to come up with a plan for adapting the course, which included implementing new tools such as Streamyard, which is a live-streaming studio that students can access on their browsers. 
Naturally, this solution encountered unforeseen problems shortly into the fall semester, such as network connection issues, the strain of streaming on laptops and video lagging.
Despite the difficulties both students and professors faced, Dowdey was impressed by the creative ideas that students generated to create their individual segments. Rather than trying to conform to usual television standards, students embraced the online setting and leaned into the goofy nature of virtual production. Whether drawing fake elements of the outside world, or using a sandbox as a “beach” setting, students were unafraid to get creative. 
“There’s kind of no limit to what you’re ready to put into it because it’s yours,” Dowdey said.
Though virtual production lengthened the leash of students’ creative freedoms when producing their television segments, the desire to return to the studio for in-person production remains. 
“We really have learned a lot in teaching online … but it is ultimately a temporary fix,” Dowdey said. “Whatever we try to do to approximate it, [the hands-on experience] is never gonna be as fulfilling as that minute when the clock hits zero and your live broadcast begins, and your show is going out as you make it. That’s irreplaceable.”

The boy in blue: Indie pop singer-songwriter hailing from Greenwich, Conn., Jack Henry Day is preparing to hit the studio and work on new songs and sounds for his upcoming debut album, “Look,.” While the 24-year-old USC alumnus has only officially released three tracks since 2019, music and storytelling have always been at the root of his endeavors and a source of consolation throughout his life. 
“My parents say that I started singing before I could speak,” Jack Henry said.
At age six, Jack Henry recalls passing someone on a busy street in New York City with his father and going home that same day to write lyrics about them, though they’d never met before. 
From taking voice lessons at a young age to developing a strong passion for musical theatre growing up, alongside his family and upbringing, Jack Henry cites Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne as having a significant influence on his musical interests and finding his voice. 
“I remember in middle school I would watch her acoustic performances and study the way that she would phrase her vocal lines,” he said. “That kind of 2000s pop rock with really powerhouse vocalists was a huge inspiration for me.” 
Though singing pop music was a challenge for him at first, with a musical theatre background, he feels it was a rewarding one. 
“In some ways it’s been a very, very long journey but in other ways I feel like it kind of just started when I was 18 or 19,” Jack Henry said. 
When Jack Henry entered his sophomore year at USC, he took a songwriting class. Over the course of the semester, he truly discovered his knack for putting melodies, stories, lyrics and chord progressions together. Sharing his material in that environment inspired him to keep writing and telling stories through music. 
“A lot of vocal melodies will come into my head right before I’m going to sleep,” he said. “And I used to be so bad. I was like, ‘If it’s good enough I’ll remember it in the morning’ and then I would just never remember it.”
Now, Jack Henry immediately picks up his phone and goes to the voice memos app to record his ideas. Humming along and testing out different lyrics with different melodies, he seems to see life in music — once even getting inspired by a songbird while taking a stroll out and about in his hometown.
“It’s one of the only things in my life that I try not to overthink,” Jack Henry said. “And so if there’s a lyric in my head, I’ll just write it down and I won’t judge it until later and usually I can get a song done within a day.”
One night, USC alumnus Hampus Wahlin recalls hearing Jack Henry singing and playing his guitar for the first time at a fraternity event. He was instantly in awe. 
“I remember immediately just being struck,” Wahlin said. 
From there, Wahlin pushed him to consider recording and releasing music. And ultimately, Jack Henry gave in with his first release in 2019 titled “Blush.” 
“I was in this kind of darker place,” Jack Henry said. “And this song really helped me to get out of that, and reminded me that having a crush on someone or liking someone or starting something new can be so fun and so beautiful.”
Jack Henry and Wahlin later worked together to bring the music video for “Blush” to life. In it, Jack Henry portrays a “love-drunk Cupid, hell bent on getting people to connect.” As this character, he reminds people of the beauty of being in love and why they connected with each other in the first place.
“He lives and breathes his music to a degree that I have very rarely seen in a person,” Wahlin said. “And there’s something incredibly rewarding about that.”
Jack Henry’s second release, which came later in 2019, was “In the Morning,” a ballad about an early relationship with someone who lived just across the street from him. The song is about wanting to know how that person felt about him when they woke up in the morning sober. Now at over 80,000 streams on Spotify, the song exemplifies how treading into the unknown can become a blessing in disguise. 
USC alumnus Harrison Poe met Jack Henry at orientation freshman year, where they were both studying theatre at the time. The two quickly struck up a friendship when they had an acting class together that year. And ever since then, they’ve been inseparable. 
When Jack Henry was working on the beginning stages of “In the Morning,” he reached out to Poe for his opinion. Then, the two began to co-write multiple songs together, such as his most recent release, “Fake Love.” 
“The great thing about Jack Henry is, he’s always working on something, he really does have such a creative mind,” Poe said. 
Poe describes their collaboration process as an open-ended conversation. 
“I think what sets Jack Henry apart as an artist is his ability to really listen to people and to ask for their opinions and really take them in,” Poe said. “And I think that’s what makes him a great person to collaborate with on my end.” 
Up until now, Jack Henry has recorded in five professional studios with a slew of producers and collaborators. This is just the beginning for this eager and ambitious artist.
Just three years after recording his first release, “Blush” from a makeshift bedroom studio, Jack Henry is preparing to record an 11-track studio album “Look,” with producer Bryan Fennelly in the coming months with the help of a crowdfunding campaign launched Feb. 24. 
Fennelly from Plaid Dog Recording in Boston, discovered Jack Henry over social media. With nearly 10 years of professional music production experience, he hopes to help Jack Henry’s vision for his debut album come to life and assist in developing his sound along the way. 
“That’s going to be the fun part about collaborating together,” Fennelly said. “[To] journey through the possibilities together and help to establish that direction for where he can continue heading with his records in the future.”
With the new songs to come, Jack Henry hopes to strip away the negative connotations that come with being on a mental health betterment journey. 
“It really has been almost like a source of therapy,” he said. “Although I’m also in therapy.”
His song lyrics are deeply introspective, pouring straight from his heart and his personal experiences. 
As for the boy in blue, Jack Henry makes it a point to stay true to himself through every track on his upcoming debut album.
“The one truth behind all of [the songs on the album] is that they are 100% from my perspective, and they are a testament to everything I’ve learned through relationships, through college, through recording for the first time,” Jack Henry said. “It’s all coming from me. And I don’t think there’s a better place to come from for a debut album than yourself.”

With one of the infamous University ‘wellness days’ just around the corner, it seems appropriate to have a topical discussion about the importance of mental health in context of the pandemic. Students at the University have access to a plethora of resources, from group and individual counseling sessions to a variety of workshops on topics such as time management or anxiety. 
However, as you’d probably guessed from previous installations of this column, we’re going to take a quick look at how the recent pandemic has impacted older adults and the overall mental health crisis. The movement for positive mental health has found its place among younger generations, so breaking the mold for older adults is a whole different issue. From cultural implications to historical pride, the stereotypes of older people being reluctant to adopt positive mental health habits needs to change. 
The notion of toxic positivity is nothing new; this idea of simply ‘getting over it’ or finding any sliver of happiness in the face of great loss or anxiety is often associated with older adults, given the recent surge of emphasis on positive mental health. 
You may have even heard some of these statements from your parents or grandparents at the dinner table or over the phone. But often, especially nowadays, we see that many older individuals are starting to recognize these issues and attempt to learn more about how to help their younger counterparts. This is all great and dandy, certainly, but these older people seem to be doing it at the expense of their own mental health. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader, asks. “I can understand some of the issues that affect emerging adults, like figuring out a convoluted job market or how to file taxes. But I can’t really wrap my head around what older people have to deal with; they seem to just brush off these issues altogether given their supposedly ‘tougher’ upbringing.”
Those are fair points, all of them. So, let’s break down some of the afflictions that older people may face. 
‘Elder abuse’ (we’ll use this term for clarification’s sake) is a surefire way to offset some form of anxiety or depression for older adults. The World Health Organization estimates that one in six older adults will experience some form of abuse in the latter half of their lifetime, physical, financial or psychological. I recommend taking a quick peek at the Netflix movie “I Care a Lot” for some insight and just an overall interesting time watching Rosamund Pike going to town.
There has also been a pandemic which has not only compounded the previously mentioned crises but has also contributed to older adults being unable to physically interact with one another. Social isolation for these vulnerable populations already fearing for their lives can have detrimental effects including poor cardiovascular functioning and cognitive decline.
In the medical world, the WHO recognizes that underidentification and stigmatization of these issues are main contributors to the many unidentified older adults who may be going through mental health concerns. 
A lack of immediate preparation for neurobiological diseases can also detrimentally impact an individual’s way of life, whether they’re the one who has been diagnosed with said disease or are immediately related to that person — a partner or caretaker. A variety of losses paired with these chronic diseases really take a toll over the course of a lifetime. 
Ultimately, not many older adults are actually staunchly against mental health initiatives. Literature on mental health suggests that over 80% of older adults are open to these new ideas, with the remaining believing that time itself will heal the wounds prompted by serious chemical imbalances and stress-inducing events.
Current treatments for mental health issues vary from prescribed medications to group discussions. Yet, like with many forms of treatment, it’s essential to recognize that each and every individual, despite similarity in age, should be treated differently out of respect for their individuality and autonomy. 
That being said, this discussion has not even truly delved into the ramifications of mental health on caretakers. Symptoms such as caregiver burnout or embodying the attitude of the patient may inflict the overall health of the many individuals who are supposed to be helping those in need. 
Taking care of older people, especially relatives, can be incredibly difficult. Recognizing that your loved one is reaching towards the end of their life can have a serious impact on your mental health, and taking up hours on end to be with them will essentially be an echo chamber of dread. 
Responsibilities and regulations currently set on behalf of caretakers may be helpful here and there, but only those who take full advantage of those legal rights and prioritize their mental health will best help their patients; however this is a conversation to be continued another time.
The ongoing mental health movement has advanced great lengths from its practical nonexistence a few decades ago. Hopefully, once we become older adults, we can reflect back on the mental health experiences we had as college students thinking, “Back in my day…”

Incidents involving trampolines don’t often end well for me, and this time was no exception. I found myself with an alarmingly crooked nose that was quickly doubling in size. Normally, this would’ve ended with a trip to the ER, but 15 minutes later I was on a video call with an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat specialist) doctor at the local hospital with a prescription for anti-swelling tablets and an ice pack pressed to my face. I was ordered to wait for the swelling to go down before visiting him in person and getting a CT scan. I’d saved myself an unnecessary trip to the hospital and consequently time, fuel and effort.
Online appointments with primary care physicians are not a foreign concept to most of us. When making an appointment with the Engemann Student Health Center, students are always offered the option of a phone appointment. Something about sitting in my dorm room and getting treated instead of making myself presentable and dragging myself to the health center while sick has always appealed to me.
Telehealth, which encompasses telemedicine, telecare and telecommunications, is the use of technology and electronic information to distribute and provide long-distance health services. Telemedicine is any remote patient-clinician interaction and diagnosis through telecommunication technologies. It can be traced back to the 1960s, where the development of novel technologies was driven primarily by the space and military divisions of numerous countries. 
In the past couple of years, while we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of telehealth services, their utilization remained low. However, since the onset of the pandemic, there has been a shift in these trends. In the first quarter of 2020, telehealth visits increased by 50% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Most of these were not coronavirus-related. But the question remains whether the telemedicine revolution is real and sustainable. Should remote care become the standard of care? Do we need to rethink how we approach the practice of medicine? 
For vulnerable populations like the elderly and socio-economically disadvantaged classes, efficient virtual patient care would mean that they could overcome the issues that are associated with in-person care. There is no need to worry about the disruption of a workday, unnecessary travel and its associated costs, or the discrimination that marginalized communities often experience in clinics. 
For those who are geographically disadvantaged, such as residents in rural or provider shortage areas, telemedicine provides basic access to primary, dental and mental health care. Considering that 83 million people in the United States live in primary care health professional shortage areas and 122million people live in mental health professional shortage areas, an established protocol for telehealth could effectively address the longest standing issue in medicine: accessibility. 
Since healthcare is a privatized industry in the United States, this increase in accessibility represents an enormous untapped market that corporations, such as Amwell, Amazon and Google, are pursuing. Furthermore, in 2020 an emergency provision through Medicare was made to reimburse all telehealth services. Now, bipartisan congressional support for making this provision permanent is on the rise. Given the convenience of telemedicine, combined with the investment of industry leaders in this market and the surge in necessity due to the coronavirus, telehealth seems like it’s here to stay. 
On the other hand, there are numerous barriers to the implementation of telehealth. Firstly, accessibility depends entirely on patients’ access to stable internet and electronic equipment. 
Additionally, most insurance packages do not cover or reimburse telehealth consultations forcing patients to seek it in person. There are also challenges due to the training of health professionals to use these tools, the cost of the equipment and a breakdown of doctor-patient relationships. 
The biggest concern is the protection of patient information and vulnerability to hacking. Doctor-patient confidentiality is the foundation of standard medical practice as we know it, but now we have to consider the responsibility of the middle-man in this relationship. In a time when data security concerns are at the forefront of the news and our minds, software providers and health platforms need to be strictly regulated and overseen to prevent breaches of our fundamental rights. 
Whether you prefer telemedicine or not, it has great potential to correct disparities in our health system and integrate healthcare into the fast-paced, technology-driven world we live in. But before this potential can be realized, there need to be meaningful steps made to overcome mistrust in technological dependency while legally defining and enforcing rules and restrictions to the evolving world of medicine. Perhaps one day, you’ll be able to go to the doctor in the comfort of your own dorm room.

Our generation is no stranger to social media. We were born into the age of the internet, grew up on MySpace and have lived our lives either directly or vicariously through Instagram.
That being said, when we entered lockdown last March, many of us, stuck in our childhood bedrooms, turned even more inwardly towards social media. My refuge of choice was TikTok; many of my friends resorted to Snapchat and my mom, even, sought sanctuary on Facebook.
While I, and many others, turned to social media to stay in contact with friends —live by proxy through past posts and even keep up-to-date on the news of our ever-changing world — the artists of our generation have used social media to share their art.
Berlin McKeague, a freshman majoring in architecture and a self-proclaimed painter, freehand drawer and photographer, began posting her art on Instagram in November 2020.
“I wanted a way to share my work,” she said, explaining that on social media she’s found an artistic community that allows more flexibility than art classes at USC offer, as there are no rubric requirements on Instagram. 
In her first year at USC, McKeague didn’t have a chance to begin her college experience on campus due to the pandemic. Consequently, art became her solace.
“I’ve enjoyed drawing and painting since I was a kid,” she said, describing herself as lucky to have gotten a chance to continue pursuing her passion for art during quarantine.
Her art Instagram (@berlinsketchbook – Check it out!) features all original pieces, from drawings to photographs, abstract to the hyper-realistic, including a surrealist ode to Tommy Trojan.
I’ve said it before, and I’m sure I’ll say it a million more times in the future: These are crazy times and turning to passions is what’s going to get us through. Berlin, her art and her Instagram are a prime example of this, but they’re just one.
Gianna Alcala, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering, also posts her art on social media to connect with her artistic communities.
Alcala’s artistic refuges of choice are acrylic painting and a newfound passion for textiles. For those who aren’t as familiar with the world of art, textiles consist of dyeing fabric and then (sometimes) creating art with it. Lately, however, she’s been focusing on her sketching.
Alcala posts her art on Instagram, much like McKeague, as well as TikTok, and she’s been at it for a while.
“I made my first art account when I was in ninth grade,” she said. “I make my art and just put it out there to share it and get feedback from other artists.” 
On her art Instagram, she can go “much more in-depth” about her work.
“In a lot of ways, I feel like I’m more myself on my art account, too,” she said. “There’s less of trying to create an image that’s used socially. It’s just more like, this is what I create.”
Alcala’s art Instagram (@gialcala.art – Go check it out!) is chock full of her original artwork, including textiles, acrylic paintings and sketches as well as progress videos of her work.
Both McKeague and Alcala turned to social media as a way to share their art but also ended up finding communities that allow them to express themselves. I’m writing not only to plug amazing artists in the USC community, but also to highlight the benefits of social media.
A large part of today’s dialogue about social media, especially Instagram, focuses on its toxicity. Social media is not perfect — the endless comparisons and flexing can definitely be draining — but finding a social media community that one enjoy’s is important. 
If that community is what’s on your feed right now, that’s amazing. But if it’s not, and if some art on your timeline might help, check out McKeague and Alcala’s art Instagrams. It might be just what is needed to get through our ongoing pandemic world.
