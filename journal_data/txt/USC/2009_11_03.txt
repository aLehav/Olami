In front of the largest crowd in more than three years, the USC men’s club soccer team battled the UCLA Bruins with bragging rights and a potential berth to the regional tournament on the line.
The fans, shielding their eyes from the blaring sun, saw the home squad come up short in a 1-0 loss at McAlister Field on Oct. 22.

The intense rivalry made for an exciting match, which featured plenty of scoring chances for the Trojans. The end of the second half was highlighted by a flurry of corner kicks and shots, but it was not enough to overcome the Bruins.
The team finished its fall season with an overall record of 2-5-3, and was not able to qualify for the regional tournament. But the team expects to participate in the 16th Annual National Intramural Recreational Sports Association National Soccer Championships, which will take place Nov. 19 to 21 at the University of Arizona.
USC coach Ryan Shaw admitted the season has been one of transition.
“It’s been rougher than anticipated,” Shaw said. “We lost half of the team from the previous season.”
To go along with the high rate of player turnover, this year the team has been promoted to the premier division of the California Collegiate Club Soccer League. The competition level has improved from previous years, but, given this team’s run as NIRSA National Championship semi-finalists last season, the club has the talent to compete in the premier division.
Although the team has struggled, junior goalkeeper Ian Coe said it was not because of a lack of skill.
“We’re just not capitalizing where we should be,” Coe said.
Although this season left more to be desired, a profound sense of optimism is apparent.
“[It’s] one of the fastest growing clubs on campus,” said club president and senior defenseman Adam Willett.
More than 100 players have participated in recent tryouts, and this year the club has added a B-team, allowing more players the opportunity to participate in collegiate-level soccer.
“The freshmen and rookies look good,” Shaw said. “We have high expectations for them.”
An expanding club and youthful talent are encouraging signals, but partaking in club-level athletics presents some unique obstacles.
The team is 90 percent self-funded, with the players contributing monetary dues. The team also accepts 100 percent tax-deductible donations, but fundraising is certainly tough because of the season’s early semester start.
The initial year as members of the California Collegiate Club Soccer League premier division has strained the team’s already-tight finances.
“As newcomers we were forced to play the University of San Francisco, UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara away from home, which is difficult on a tight budget,” Willett said.
Given the hardships in having a mostly self-funded organization, the team has become more focused and goal-oriented than in years past.
“Last year, we set goals to reach regionals and nationals, and we accomplished those goals … This year we have taken a more serious approach,” Shaw said.
This determined approach also stems from the pride the team feels as the only men’s soccer program on campus.
The UCLA match served as a microcosm of the club’s season. The loss showed the team’s offensive shortcomings, but Shaw lauded the team’s effort.
“They played much better than they have in the past couple of games,” Shaw said.
The optimism surrounding the team was on display for the large crowd at McAlister Field. As the club continues to grow in number and build on previous success, the players have pulled together.
“[The team’s chemistry] is fantastic — it has never been as issue. [It] is one of the team’s best attributes,” Shaw said.
This strong sense of rapport is crucial, especially at the club level, where players are responsible for the maintenance of the entire club’s functions.
The team chemistry is not only felt by the coach.
“[It’s a] really tight group,” said sophomore midfielder Nick Puliot. “We hang out outside of soccer.”
With a dedicated and young foundation, the USC men’s soccer club looks to reach its lofty expectations at the NIRSA National Championships and in seasons to come.

Former USC basketball player David Bluthenthal has more stamps on his passport than a package from the United States Postal Service.
Bluthenthal, a small forward who attended USC from 1998 to 2002, came to the university after leading Westchester High in Los Angeles to the Division I state championship.
Glory days · David Bluthenthal was a key contributor for USC’s men’s basketball team when it made the Elite Eight in 2001. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
After not getting drafted by the NBA, Bluthenthal decided to go to Israel to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv, a team which faced the Clippers in an exhibition game in October.
Many USC basketball fans will remember the former standout from his Trojan days.
As a sophomore at USC, he was named All-Pac-10 honorable mention.
As a junior, Bluthenthal helped lead USC to the Elite Eight round of the NCAA tournament.
As a senior, he again earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention honors and finished his career with the third most three-point shots made in school history.
“Playing for [former USC coach Henry] Bibby really helped me,” Bluthenthal said. “He is an NBA person, and he coached us like we were men and NBA players. That personally helped prepare me for life as a man on my own.”
After college, Bluthenthal entered the NBA Draft. He watched as his USC teammate, Sam Clancy, was taken by the Philadelphia 76ers. However, Bluthenthal was not drafted.
“I was very disappointed. That had been my dream my whole life,” he said. “To not get drafted was a very difficult thing for me.”
Because he is Jewish, he was able to obtain Israeli citizenship, which is an advantage because many international basketball leagues limit the number of foreign basketball players that can be on the roster.
Maccabi Tel Aviv’s playing style suits Bluthenthal well; in 2004, he helped lead Maccabi Tel Aviv to the Euroleague championship.
Over the next few years, Bluthenthal moved around Europe, playing for Dynamo St. Petersburg in Russia, Benetton Treviso and Virtus Bologna in Italy, and Le Mans in France.
Bluthenthal signed again with Maccabi Tel Aviv for the 2009-2010 season.
“I am 29 now, and I feel like I have a lot of basketball left in me,” he said. “Everyday I continue to work towards that dream, while at the same [time] appreciating where I am and what I have. I have traveled the world, made a good living, and I am happy.”
Bluthenthal’s success with Maccabi Tel Aviv caught the attention of the Sacramento Kings, who signed him prior to the 2004-2005 season. He appeared in seven preseason games, averaging 3.4 points per game. However, he was released before the start of the regular season.
“It was a great opportunity to play in the NBA and live the NBA lifestyle,” Bluthenthal said of his time with the Kings. “I had my chances, but I did not stick.”
He was back in Los Angeles in October, playing with Maccabi Tel Aviv in an exhibition game against the Los Angeles Clippers at the Staples Center. The game was played to raise money for the world’s largest orphanage, Migdal Ohr.
Maccabi Tel Aviv’s offense is suited to Bluthenthal’s style, allowing him to get open three-point shots and easy baskets.
“[They run] a lot more cuts and ball screens than most NBA teams,” Clipper center DeAndre Jordan said.
Bluthenthal made quite an impression against the Clippers, scoring 12 points in Maccabi Tel Aviv’s 108-96 loss.
Clippers point guard and former UCLA standout Baron Davis, who played against Bluthenthal in college, called him “a great person with great ability.”
Clippers forward Blake Griffin guarded Bluthenthal for much of the game. Griffin said Bluthenthal “has a nice shot, and he is a strong guy. He showed a lot tonight.”
Bluuuth! This guy ruled campus when I was a freshman. USC’s Elite Eight run was one of the most awesome few weeks we had in college; students were tremendously excited, and USC actually felt like a basketball school for a month (I can remember we had a class revolt when the teacher refused to reschedule a class that was during one of the games!). It’s something I wish the Trojans got to experience more, March Madness is really something else when your team is flying high in the tourney.
Interesting factoid: Bluthenthal is a direct descendant of Isaias Hellman, one of USC’s three founders.

It was “Competition Tuesday” at Howard Jones Field, and the offense and defense were entangled in a fierce battle at the end-of-practice scrimmage.
The end result was a 8-7 victory for the offense — by all accounts a much closer score than the 47-20 loss the Trojans suffered at the hands of the Oregon Ducks on Saturday.
Lessons to learn · Pete Carroll said freshman quarterback Matt Barkley and other young USC players will learn from the trying season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Don’t remind them.
“I hate losing,” freshman quarterback Matt Barkley said. “It’s really terrible to see our team go down and it kills me inside. You try your best not to show it, but from this point on we’ve moved on.”
Barkley has, at a minimum, two years left as a Trojan. USC coach Pete Carroll said after practice Tuesday that 2009 will surely serve as a learning experience for Barkley and Co.
“The experience of this season will pay off for a number of years for our guys,” Carroll said. “The challenges we’ve had, the games that we’ve played, the settings that we’ve been in — we’ll always be able to utilize that as long as these guys are here.”
u
On the injury front, redshirt junior running back Allen Bradford sat out of practice with a sore knee Tuesday, leaving Howard Jones Field early.
“His knee was sore coming out of the weekend,” Carroll said. “He got banged on it, and it’s still too sore to push it right now. He had X-rays over the weekend, but it’s still very sore.”
Junior running back Joe McKnight also stayed on the sidelines with a sore hamstring, which Carroll described as minor.
“We’re just making sure we don’t extend it and allow it to nag all through the week, so we’ve got to rest him for a couple days here,” he said.
If either of the two can’t suit up against Arizona State, it’s likely that redshirt junior running back C.J. Gable will pick up the carries.
Gable registered more than 100 carries during both his freshman and sophomore seasons, but has carried the ball only 16 times this season.
“C.J.’s ready to go,” Carroll said. “He’s been waiting, and he’s done a great job of being patient about it.
“He can answer that call. He’s done it for years, and I know he can now.”
Middle linebacker redshirt sophomore Chris Galippo returned to practice Tuesday showing no ill effects from a neck injury.
Carroll said Galippo was 100 percent recovered.
u
Arizona State freshman linebacker Vontaze Burfict was a USC verbal commit for much of the recruiting process before switching to the Sun Devils on Signing Day amid concerns he wouldn’t qualify academically at USC.
Now, Burfict is the starter at middle linebacker for Arizona State and the centerpiece of a young defense.
“He’s a young guy that’s really trying to make an impression,” Carroll said. “He’s really a physical player, and he runs sideline to sideline. He’s a good-looking prospect, fantastic-looking player, and he’s only gonna get better as he grows within their system.”
Burfict was the highest-ranked high school prospect to ever sign a letter of intent with Arizona State.
“He’s a beast and he plays hard,” Barkley said. “He doesn’t stop. I’m excited to see him play. From the tape we watched, he plays like a crazy man.”

Cross purposes
We have recently become aware of an event sponsored by the USC College Republicans on tonight, in which David Horowitz will be brought to our campus to give a speech entitled “The Campus War Against Israel and the Jews” as part of a yearly campaign entitled “Islamo Fascism Awareness Week” that he does at college campuses across the country every fall.
Horowitz has previously asserted:
– African-Americans owe American society a debt for having been enslaved for hundreds of years, and that they should display gratitude to white Americans for the system of institutionalized oppression that completely denied African-Americans any human rights;
– Muslim Student Union groups in the United States are supporters of terrorist activity abroad, “are part of the network founded by the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas and funded by Saudi money,” and send money abroad to help “exterminate the Jews;”
– Students should stay away from “women’s studies, black studies, cultural studies, whiteness studies, post-colonial studies, all those studies [sic]” because they are “dangerous” for students’ minds.
These statements demonstrate Horowitz’s racist, offensive, and ignorant views of various communities, and he has used his Islamo Fascism tour to promote these views and make these statements in the past. The fact that these statements are accepted as academic debate or anything more than racist ranting is absurd and truly a stain on the level of debate in American society today.
Despite this, universities across this country continue provide him a forum to speak and dignify his racism by allowing it to echo out from the highest levels of academia. This racism is directly attacking our student population, and his diatribes offend every student who does not consider her or himself a racist. Allowing Horowitz to speak at USC is paramount to the administration’s elevation of his hate speech to academic debate, in effect legitimizing his verbal attacks on students.
SCampus, the document that outlines the university administration’s relationship with the student body, declares in the Principles of Community, “As a scholarly community, we aspire to create an environment in which racism, sexism, ageism, xenophobia and homophobia do not go unchallenged,” and further states that, “We [USC] speak out against hatred and bigotry whenever and wherever we find them.”
USC has a responsibility to its students to protect them, as the administration itself acknowledges, and to not allow that the lecterns of our university be used as a forum for people from outside the student body to come and threaten students. In the past, Horowitz has done exactly this — made derogatory remarks towards entire communities of students based on their race and religion.
How exactly is the USC administration protecting students as it allows Horowitz to use the platform USC provides as a pulpit for racist hatred and incitement, unchallenged, as he has in the past?
As students, we ask that the USC administration be conscious of the kind of academic environment it is fostering by promoting racist speakers such as Horowitz, and that it be willing to act in accordance with its own protocols regarding hate speech and the targeting of students.

Double standards
Tonight College Republicans is hosting David Horowitz, founder of the Freedom Center. Mr. Horowitz is a political conservative and an advocate of pro-Israel policies. For exercising its right as a student organization to host a speaker on campus, College Republicans has faced unfounded attacks by the student organizations Students for Justice in Palestine and Progressive Alliance. SJP and Progressive Alliance are distributing fliers, emails and Facebook messages that accuse Mr. Horowitz of making racist statements and of perpetuating hate against individuals of the Islamic faith. These flyers, emails and Facebook messages are slanderous against Mr. Horowitz and College Republicans, as they are categorically false. College Republicans refuses to allow SJP and Progressive Alliance to slander its members and its speaker Mr. Horowitz with such abhorrent statements. Slander is a serious legal wrong and is legally actionable.
Following is Mr. Horowitz’s response to the accusations that SJP and Progressive Alliance are launching against him:
“I am not a racist and I am not an Islamophobe. I have organized protests on more than 100 college campuses against the oppression of Muslim women. I have published booklets against the oppression of Muslim women, and I have sponsored panels with Muslim speakers against the oppression of Muslim women. There are numerous videos of my campus speeches on the web where I can be seen saying that my efforts are not directed against all Muslims, but are in fact conducted on behalf of most Muslims against the hijacking of their religion by totalitarian radicals who are conducting a campaign of hatred against Jews and gays and other minority groups. In their emails, Facebook messages and flyers, SJP threatens to attack my speech by any means necessary. I hope members of the USC community will appeal to university officials to see that civility and order are maintained around this event, and that Students for Justice in Palestine are put on notice that this kind of anti-intellectual and uncivil behavior is unacceptable.”
College Republicans does not ask the USC community to embrace our speaker’s opinions, but we are enforcing our right to freedom of expression by bringing him to speak at USC. Furthermore, we refuse to allow SJP and Progressive Alliance to slander our organization and our speaker. If College Republicans were to distribute fliers with inflammatory and false statements about SJP or Progressive Alliance, there would be a campus-wide outcry against College Republicans. We refuse to tolerate this double standard, and we reserve the right to take all necessary legal action against student organizations which have slandered and continue to slander our organization’s name and Mr. Horowitz.

Two Jacks? That’s just weird.. I didn’t even post that last one.
What next democrats?  I guess the next logical organization for you to bring on campus would be from Al Qaeda.
What’s next Republicans? I guess the next logical organization representative for you to bring on campus would be from KKK.
Lalia,
You must be kidding us, right?  It is a safe bet Horowitz has received dozens of death threats from Muslims.  It is a fact that Muslims have killled, and continue to kill, those who speak out against Islam.  Your outrage –real or feigned– is either purposely naive or simply stupid.  Horowtiz deserves to use common sense in deciding who is allowed into his lectures based on the history of death threats against him.
Here is exactly what many Muslims would like to do to Horowtiz if given the chance:
http://www.jihadwatch.org/2009/10/uk-muslim-protesters-threaten-geert-wilders-well-have-his-head.html
And as far as slavery goes, Islam’s history of slavery makes the West’s history look practically benign.
This is not to excuse the West’s history with slavery, but just to say Islam’s history is far worse.
In fact there are still a handful of Islamic countries that still allow slavery.
http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_9_54/ai_85410331/
Laila,
You’re right.  Horowitz had no reason to be concerned about people with Arab sounding names being in the same room with him.  After all Arabs/Muslims are extraordinarily tolerant and compassionate people.  Just ask them:
http://www.jihadwatch.org/2009/10/uk-muslim-protesters-threaten-geert-wilders-well-have-his-head.html
Lalia,
Did you knw that Saudi Arabia outlawed slavery in 1962?  That is right.  Not until 1962 did Saudi Arabia pass legislation on slavery.
Did you know Mohammed practiced and encouraged his followers to enslave non-Muslims?  It’s true.  It’s right there in the Koran for you to read.
Read what Tripoli’s Envoy said to Thomas Jefferson about slavery.  This is from negoations surrounding the Barbary Coast Wars:
In March 1785, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to negotiate with Tripoli’s envoy to London, Ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja). Upon inquiring “concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury”, the ambassador replied:
It was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every muslim who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise. He said, also, that the man who was the first to board a vessel had one slave over and above his share, and that when they sprang to the deck of an enemy’s ship, every sailor held a dagger in each hand and a third in his mouth; which usually struck such terror into the foe that they cried out for quarter at once. [2] [3]
Jefferson reported the conversation to Secretary of State John Jay, who submitted the Ambassador’s comments and offer to Congress. Jefferson argued that paying tribute would encourage more attacks.
I’d like to invite people who don’t know much about David Horowitz (like Chris) to do a little research. I promise, it doesn’t take much to discover that he is, in fact, a racist. He is not interested in holding academic debates, instead, he is a man who speaks out of hate and who wishes to incite anger in others.
These are quotes taken directly from David Horowitz articles:
“There Is No One Group That Benefited Exclusively From [the] Fruits [of slavery]
The claim for reparations is premised on the false assumption that only whites have benefited from slavery. If slave labor created wealth for Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well, including the descendants of slaves. The GNP of black America is so large that it makes the African-American community the 10th most prosperous “nation” in the world. American blacks on average enjoy per capita incomes in the range of twenty to fifty times that of blacks living in any of the African nations from which they were kidnapped” (“Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks – and Racist Too”  – FrontPageMagazine.com | Wednesday, January 03, 2001)
This quote suggests that black Americans today should be grateful for their ancestor’s
enslavement because, today, they are benefiting from the wealth that came out of slavery. The quote also says that African Americans are much better off than Africans. The implication seems to be that African Americans should be happy that their ancestors were kidnapped and systematically oppressed, because otherwise, they’d still be in Africa.
“What About The Debt Blacks Owe To America?
Slavery existed for thousands of years before the Atlantic slave trade was born, and in all societies. But in the thousand years of its existence, there never was an anti-slavery movement until white Christians – Englishmen and Americans — created one. If not for the anti-slavery attitudes and military power of white Englishmen and Americans, the slave trade would not have been brought to an end. If not for the sacrifices of white soldiers and a white American president who gave his life to sign the Emancipation Proclamation, blacks in America would still be slaves. If not for the dedication of Americans of all ethnicities and colors to a society based on the principle that all men are created equal, blacks in America would not enjoy the highest standard of living of blacks anywhere in the world, and indeed one of the highest standards of living of any people in the world. They would not enjoy the greatest freedoms and the most thoroughly protected individual rights anywhere. Where is the gratitude of black America and its leaders for those gifts? ” (“Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks – and Racist Too”  – FrontPageMagazine.com | Wednesday, January 03, 2001)
Most of this paragraph is terribly offensive. But my first response is: since when are human rights a gift? And since when should a people who had to struggle and fight FOR THEIR OWN FREEDOM (the civil rights movement was all about SELF-DETERMINATION) give thanks to their oppressors for “awarding” them something that should be intrinsically theirs?
The article goes on. Sometimes the language is not straight forward in its racism, but if you analyze it and deconstruct what Horowitz is saying, the message is clear.
I also think it is worth while mentioning that a number of students were not allowed into the event, though there were empty seats in the room. The students who were not allowed into the building were notified before the event took place that they would not be allowed in – and every single one of these students had Arab sounding names. At the event, one republican student stated that these students were denied entry because of safety precautions. The implication was clear: if you have an Arab sounding last name, you are a threat (a potential terrorist?). An obvious example of  racial profiling.
Miles writes, “I am appalled that USC has repeatedly allowed racists like Horowitz to speak on campus.”
Miles, could you tell me what “race” Islam is?
This is not a trick question.
Islam is a religion, not a race.
It is a religion founded by a warrior named Mohammed.  He killed, raped, pillaged the Arabian Peninsula until only Muslims lived there.  His exploits and his words to his followers to follow his example accounts for Islam’s numbers and geographic reach.
Tell me how Islam is a race instead of a religion of war?  You’re either seriously confused or a huckster for Islam.
As a student not biased to once side or the other, I wouldn’t have known David Horowitz existed or that he was speaking unless groups on campus didn’t make a huge stink about him speaking. If their goals were to not let his message spread, it was a pretty poor job. By bringing attention to him speaking, you get me interested in what he has to say.
And his responses to criticism seem a lot more intelligent than the attacks against him (a few bullet points that seem to be out of context if anything don’t do much for me).
The statements and views attributed to me are utterly false. The signers of the malicious and slanderous statement against me may be ignorant of what I have said and written but that’s pretty hard to believe. This is a vicious attack on me, on the College Republicans and on the principle of free speech. That this kind of attack should come from USC professors is disgraceful and merely demonstrates the pathetic intellectual levels of discourse which are apparently tolerated at this university.
Consider this: What kind of “debate” happens in Muslim countries?
All you see are “men” marching in the streets with their FISTS in the air, chanting HATEFUL, ANGRY slogans.
Their women (which are just pieces of property) stay at home & obey their every word…all out of FEAR.
Do you liberals/left-wingers/so-called “progressives” truly ADMIRE this FEARFUL lifestyle? How could you?
This entire debate is originally between 2 brothers: Isaac  & Ishmael, who had the same father, Abraham.
Listen & reason with one of Isaac’s decendants (Mr. Horowitz).
Then see how the emotional hate, anger, & rage of the Muslim’s (Ishmael) reacts.
Watch the false, hateful accusations & threats fly…from Ishmael’s followers.
Pathetic, isn’t it? Especially when you want to LEARN about BOTH sides of the conflict….in a UNIVERSITY!
I am in full support of this letter because even though there are multiple sides and perspectives concerning issues of race, gender, religion, etc. what we hear and see in mainstream media is NOT multi-faceted, not to mention the amount of funding these speakers (like Anne Coulter) get to come speak at campuses is outrageous. I know that students have a right to speak on behalf of these issues of race, gender, and religion that both affect them both personally and as a community.
Lefties all say that they’re the ones with the “open minds”….that we need to be “tolerant” of others. In fact, Horowitz used to be a left-wing communist in his college days, and once he matured, he saw how foolish he was. Left-wingers HAVE TO shout down or silence anyone who disagrees with them. They’re like the ignorant oratorical schoolyard bullies who only know the “tip of the iceberg”. Way to many students these days have a HERD MENTALITY & let the big mouths attack others and then speak for their fabricated majority. It’s a shame. USC…Open your limited academic minds & listen to this guy. I, too, was a communist in my student days and I’m ashamed that I got caught up in that Persecutor-Victim-Rescuer “Hero” racket. What a waste of time. And worst of all….I thought I was some kind of Hero! Do yourself a favor & take your fricking blinders off & hear what he has to say. Ignore the statements that he reportedly made or were taken out of context. Agenda driven leftist are well know for lying in order to advance their pathetic cause. They have NO concern or knowledge of the truth. Do you? If you do, listen patiently, & with respect. to BOTH sides.
Diane, it’s hard to argue that Mr. Horowitz’s career has not been largely built off of stirring up xenophobia and distrust of Muslims.
You’re quite right about the constitution, but this sudden adherence to its most basic tenements seems selective at best. I’m sure the College Republicans would be in a greater bind if firearms were permitted on campus, as the constitution implies. When you enter a university with a diverse student body, you must take these things into consideration, and just like a gun, free speech can be used as a destructive weapon. He should not be nationally censored, but it is irresponsible of USC to allow him to speak on campus. I find it believable that this is happening only because racism against Muslims has risen since September 11. If the speaker were anti-semitic, anti-Christian, we would not be having this debate.
People like Robert D. Skeels are unapologetic hypocrites. They apparently are perfectly happy to stand by and applaud all manner of speakers on campus, as long as they don’t disagree with him.
Horowitz’ ideas are relevant to this discussion, and attempting to suppress them is UNAMERICAN. Did you guys ever hear of the Constitution? And Mr. Skeels, wrap your small mind around this — just because someone disagrees with you does not mean they are engaging in “hate speech.” What’s more, ALL speech constitutes free speech. Again, I respectfully point you back to the Constitution, which as much as you may wish it to be so, has not yet been amended to exclude the speech of people who rub you the wrong way.
Pathetic.
What’s more, ideas either stand or fall on their own. Let him speak. Let people judge what he has to say with open minds. If his ideas are so wrong, that will be evident, won’t it? What are you so afraid of? That he perhaps has some truth to impart?
I find it abhorrent that perhaps the leading apologist for racism and reaction on campuses today will be at one of our local universities. Mr. Horowitz has demonstrated time and time again through his writing, speaking, and associations a propensity for the most vile and unmitigated hate speech.
I applaud the USC student organizations for having the courage to point out who Mr. Horowitz is, and the despicable ideas he represents. We need to encourage this movement to exclude racist reactionaries like Mr. Horowitz and his ilk from being given any platform that remotely legitimizes their poisoned ideology and anti-muslim diatribes. Lest small and reactionary minds clamor about free speech, let’s be clear; hate speech does not constitute free speech.
This is a well reasoned, powerful letter that stresses some seriously alarming hypocrisy on the part of the USC administration.
I am appalled that USC has repeatedly allowed racists like Horowitz to speak on campus. This tolerance for intolerance counteracts USC’s “pledge” to combat bigotry and hatred, and delegitimizes the university’s desired reputation as a progressive community for a diverse student body. Shame on the administration for allowing this, and shame on the USC College Republicans for embracing this man’s vile, hateful ideas as considerable discourse. Free speech ends when you endanger the rights of others, and that is exactly what Horowitz does for a living.
This is not freedom of speech, it is hate speech. What a shame because true Jews and Israelis don’t even believe in even half what this guy says. Don’t be fooled by College Republicans, this man is a racist and needs to be quieted.
People like this feed off of controversy so I am sure there is some way to shut him up.

With nothing but a projector screen and folding chairs, the tiny Embassy Auditorium of the Davidson Conference Center is a far cry from the 50-foot-high IMAX theater where Darwin’s Dilemma was originally scheduled to be screened. Even though the California Science Center recently backed out of its contract to host the film’s Los Angeles premiere, the tensions created by the controversial documentary’s release followed the event to its new location.
As everyone settled into their seats, the room was already bustling with conflicting opinions on Darwin’s 150-year-old theory of evolution.
Controversy · The California Science Center’s IMAX Theater backed out of a contract to screen Darwin’s Dilemma, a pro-intelligent design film. - Photo courtesy of Illustra Media
“I don’t believe in this intelligent design stuff,” one attendee whispered; another gently poked fun at the idea of humans popping out of a random interaction of atoms. Even in today’s modern world, the intimate room was a clear display of the debate raised since Darwin first published The Origin of Species in 1859: Who are we and where did we come from?
The night started off with a short clip from We Are Born of Stars, the first 3-D film created for IMAX projection. Choppy, rough and with limited black-and-white computer graphics, the film provided a structural view of our essential building block of life — DNA. Unfortunately, the film was in Japanese, and those who came without a basic scientific knowledge of DNA structures were left in the dark. But this brief prelude was meant to portray the deep mystery of DNA in living creatures, which is an integral component in Darwin’s theory of evolution.
Darwin’s Dilemma, screened shortly afterwards, was a much more modern and technologically sophisticated film in comparison. The final installment of Illustra Media’s long-planned Intelligent Design trilogy, this documentary brings to light the contradiction between the fossil record and Darwin’s theories. It focuses on the Cambrian explosion, a time period in the earth’s history in which there was a sudden “explosion” of complex species without any ancestral trace.
The film can be divided into three counterarguments.
First, it states that the Cambrian explosion heavily conflicts with Darwin’s theory. According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, every organism requires a prior ancestral form. But even Darwin admits that the fossil record below the Cambrian strata is devoid of any evidence of such creatures. How, then, did these vast and inexplicably new species suddenly appear out of nowhere?
Darwin attributed it to an incomplete fossil record, but after 150 years, scientists are still searching to fill the gap. The film goes into depth on this point, giving several reasons and evidence on the lack of Precambrian fossils that are ancestral to modern phyla in the Cambrian strata.
Next, the film questions the truth of Darwin’s theory. The graph drawn according to Darwin’s theory is very much like a tree of life, stemming up from one common species and branching into many different groups of organisms. But the film turns this graph upside down, suggesting that a basic structural form for complex life existed first, which then evolved into the differing, elaborate details.
It also gives several reasons why a gene mutation cannot be transformed into a new species, mainly because DNA is actually not responsible for the blueprint of animal development. DNA by itself cannot assemble cells, tissues, muscles and body parts. The film uses these ideas to form its final proposal: intelligent design.
Though unmistakably pro-intelligent design, Darwin’s Dilemma takes on a purposefully secular stance. The word “God” is never mentioned. Instead, less threatening euphamisms like “information source” and “designer” are used. In fact, post-screening panelist and anti-evolution activist Jonathan Wells emphasized that intelligent design is not creationism or natural theology.
“Intelligent design is not a random, convenient solution to evolution,” Wells said. “In fact, it actually opens more doors to scientific research and investigation.”
This, according to Wells, is because a lot of scientific claims come from from a preconceived “story” (Darwin’s theory), in which the scientists just plug in the “plot” (or whatever fossil they happen to find) to make the story work.
Darwin’s Dilemma is indeed an eye-opener, but it does so in an analytical and scientific way. It addresses many key points and counterarguments, providing ample evidence and support with the help of cutting-edge computer graphics and interviews from several leading scientists, some of whom are not even proponents of intelligent design.
It challenges a lot of conventional scientific ideas about evolution, including information from educational textbooks.
But does it leave the viewer with a definite conclusion to this evolution debate? The film ends appropriately with a quote from Darwin: “I can give no satisfactory answer.”
This being a controversial and emotionally charged subject, the large number and varying types of questions thrown by the audience to the post-screening panelists was not surprising. David Berlinski, senior fellow at the Discovery Institute and author of numerous books such as The Devil’s Delusion, touched upon the social implications of evolution.
“Discussion and debate over evolution is not just limited to scientific issues,” he said. “It is a conflicting view of the nature of human beings, and the society that we humans want to build.”
Will the debate ever come to an end? Will we ever reach a satisfactory answer to the origins of life?
Berlinski answers, “Maybe, but probably not.”
And thus, the dilemma goes on.
Henry wrote:
All the theories of science follow the standard of falsifiabilty. At least a theory should include statements that are falsifiable, plus other statements that are consequences of such statements. So creationist ideas should follow the same standard.
A theory might contain some statements that are not falsifiable, but they are consequences of other statements that are, or they motivate statements that are.
There are numerous examples of falsifiable statements within evolution. For example see Ridley’s textbook on Evolution.
On the other hand, ID is not only not falsifiable, it’s basic ideas are not even well-defined. For example, it often relies on probability to show “specified complexity”. But what is the cutting point of probability such that beyond it we should assume it must be designed? Furthermore, how exactly do you calculate those probabilities? These basic issues are not even well defined, let alone falsifiable.
You are right, string theory is hard to test (at least with current tools). And in fact, some have actually questioned whether it could be called scientific. Those critics include prominent physicists such as Sheldon Glashow and others. But notice, it is only hard to test, not in principle impossible. Furthermore, since string theory is based on quantum mechanics and relativity, which are falsifiable, it is indirectly falsifiable. Any example that falsify relativity or quantum mechanics will falsify string theory indirectly.
Kaku might mention God, but you have to be careful to interpret what he means by God. It is similar to how we know that Einstein mentions God in some often quoted statements, but further reading makes it clear he does not mean a designer God. Similarly, don’t take Kaku’s statement literally.
The real question here is: Is there purpose in biology or is it a matter of random natural occurrences?  If it’s the former then ID is true.  If it’s the latter then Darwinism is true.  I think we can agree that ID and Darwinism are opposite conclusions to the question of origins.  As a result the falsification of ID would be Darwinism and vise versa.  ID and Darwinism can’t BOTH be true.  Either biology shows evidence of ID or it doesn’t.  So the falsification of ID would be Darwinism.
The same can be said of their place in science.  Either both are science or neither are science.  You can’t say that Darwinism is science while denouncing ID as science.  If you can’t test the hypothesis of ID in science, then you can’t test Darwinism.  Some how Darwinism has become immune from evidence and critique.
In the same vein, I find it rather ironic that you caution me to not taking Kaku literally, but for some reason it’s OK to take Dawkins, Hitchens and their ilk literally.  It’s clearly a hypocritical way to approach this topic.  I can’t figure out if you really don’t understand that you are biased or if you are doing it on purpose.
“Your assumption that ID is based on religious beliefs is unfounded. “
Now here we go again ,, around in cricles,. There just is no aruging with people who believe that the dinosaurs died out because they wouldn’t fit on Noah’s Ark.
When Judge Jones a bush appointed, conservative, federal juge, (self proclaimed born again Christian),says.
“The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom. “
So what part of Lying sack of crap don’t you understand?
Henry wrote:
ID is not only used by religious organizations for their purposes. But the proponents of ID actually made statements that reveal their religious motivations. For example, Dembsky, one of the biggest proponents of Intelligent Design, wrote: ” … the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.”. See his book, “Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology.”
The ID people are not simply being used by religion. The ID people themselves said such things.
Please keep that quote in context.  You are pulling his thought out of context and twisting it to serve your point of view.  Dembsky talks a lot about his personal belief system and he does a good job of separating what he believes with his research on design.
Demksy writes in The Design Revolution, p. 26:
Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But there’s no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the world’s major theistic faiths. . . . As a Christian I hold that the Christian God is the ultimate source of design behind the universe [here he is talking about his personal beliefs NOT his research in design – then goes on to say]. . . . But there’s no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26).

Your assumption that ID is based on religious beliefs is unfounded.  As with Dembsky, religious beliefs are based in ID not the other way around as you accuse.
I’m tired of not being able to click on the “Reply” button so I’m starting new threads.  Hope that’s OK…

Two things.
First of all, the person who makes a statement has to prove it. You made the statement about Dawkins saying things. You should prove it. Yes, you should do research, if you want to make a statement. That’s normal procedure in arguments. You don’t ask others to find the proof for your statement. You made the statement, you prove it. No proof, your statement is ignored.
Second, I actually checked the video, as I said before. I did the research, although it should’ve been your job. And I didn’t find that statement as you claimed. So I could already say you are wrong. But I was just trying to be nice and ask perhaps I missed something (although I checked) and I am giving you the chance to prove your point by showing the time, in case I missed it. But fine, you refused even to do your job or to take the chance to prove your case.
Okay then, since I did check it and it’s not there, then you are wrong. As simple as that.
Well, that’s a good way to remain closed minded.  If you approach the topic of ID this way it’s no wonder why you don’t understand it – you simply refuse to understand it.  The parallel would be astounding if it wasn’t so laughable.
Ultimately, though, you preach about claims needing to be falsified yet when you have the chance to falsify one of my claims you refuse to do it.  I told you where to look and I even told you where in the movie to look yet you refuse to look because I didn’t give you the exact coordinates to where it is in the movie.  You can’t get much more closed minded then that.
I told you it’s there and where to find it.  If you want to disprove it then do it.  If not then your idea that I’m wrong is based on your resistance not my lack of “proof”.
From the article: “But this brief prelude was meant to portray the deep mystery of DNA in living creatures, which is an integral component in Darwin’s theory of evolution.”
I was unaware that DNA was integral to Darwin’s theory. Wow, you learn something new every day!
I know , I know,, The flying spaghetti monster did it.

They make a far better argument than of you ID/creationist ever did.
Mitchell, most ID proponents (as well as opponents) don’t take the FSM seriously.  It’s nothing more then a straw man fallacy.  Pointing to the FSM only shows that one has an elementary way of thinking.  Critical thinking skills look beyond platitudes to try and see its legitimate underpinnings.   The FSM is a tired charade of anecdotal nonsense.
Steve, the points made in the Flying Spaghetti Monster idea are analogous, and seems to be of equal validity, as the main points of Creationism. So if you think FSM is nonsense, it follows that creationism is nonsense.
Any first year philosophy student will tell you that analogies are a poor form of argumentation because they cannot prove anything; they serve only to illustrate.
The FSM does nothing to debunk the necessity of or how legitimate the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe.
William Lane Craig shares similar thoughts about the FSM:
What’s ironic about [the FSM] is that ID theorists like William Dembski have been insisting on this same point for years, but everyone seems to think them disingenuous. Dembski makes it abundantly clear that on the basis of the specified complexity in the universe one cannot infer that the Designer is infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and so forth. It is precisely for that reason that ID theorists deny that ID is disguised religion. The identification of the Designer with God is a theological conclusion that cannot itself be warranted on the basis of the design argument alone.
Dembski writes:
Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But there’s no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the world’s major theistic faiths. . . .

But there’s no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26).
Therefore, Dembski is adamant that religious interpretations of Intelligent Design should not be taught in public classrooms. Dembski himself, had he thought of it, might have appealed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster to illustrate his point! Ironically, then, the FSM actually reinforces one of the central contentions of the ID movement, that it is not religious teaching. The inference to a Designer is not an inference to any particular deity.
It’s easy to see that the FSM fails to show that an inference to an intelligent designer of the universe is either illegitimate or unwarranted.
The real shame of the FSM is that people, like yourself, are duped into believing that caricatures like the FSM genuinely show the “nonsense” of the gods of the great religions of our day.  It shows your ignorance in not only what god really means to people of religious persuasion, but also how utterly ignorant you are of the works of Anselm, Aquinas, Leibniz, Paley, Sorley, and a host of others, past and present.
Anybody who knows science, and especially biology, knows “information source” and “designer” are not meaningful unless defined (and falsifiable).
Discovery Institute doesn’t answer serious scientific questions, thus not a credible example of “using science”.
Kyle, you are avoiding answering the question – how would evolutionists explain
where the information comes from in living matter? Information requires a source.
Heinz,
I did give examples of information being added by natural mechanisms. For example, gene duplication. See my other comments above.
Henry, your example of adding information does not answer my question.
In your example of gene duplication you assume a living organism with
DNA already existing. My question – how is information added to non-living
material (that contains no information) to produce a living organism (that
contains information in its DNA)?
Moreover, you must also consider other relevant scientific findings:
  1. Chance mutations cannot produce new information.
      Read “Not by Chance” book by Dr. Lee Spetner.
      Read “Signature in the Cell” book by Stephen Meyer.
      Of course this only applies to matter already living
      and having information.
  2. Natural Selection can only select from existing
      information in the living matter. And that information
      must exist first before it can be selected. Again read
      Stephen Meyer’s book “Signature in the Cell.”
Conclusion – Neo-Darwinian mechanisms do not explain
how evolution works, let alone how information is injected
into non-living matter in the first place.
Heinz,
First of all, evolution is about the change of life from existing life, not about the origin of the very first DNA or life from non-living material (abiogenesis). Evolution is about how information is modified, and even added, to existing life, by natural processes such as random mutations. That type of creation of information has been observed many times. I’ve given some examples of that.
Your question is not about evolution, but abiogenesis: how the very first life got information from non-living material. But notice that any pattern implies information. In this sense, even non-living things already contain information. Complex molecules by themselves (outside of and apart from living beings) contain information. So the question is not how information is created from non-information, because even non-living things already contain information.
A more relevant question is how the type of information in living things (such as in the DNA), can arise from other types of information that already existed in non-living things. It is not an issue of how information can be created from zero information (as you wrongly think), but how information can be modified from one type to another by natural processes. It is still a hard problem, but not as impossible as you made it sound, since non-living things already have information to begin with.
Now, back to evolution, to answer your more specific points …
Spetner is wrong. Chance mutations can add information. For instance, there are observed increase in genetic variety in bacteria, observed by Lenski. Other examples: there are hundreds of enzymes where random mutations produce increased specificity (increased information).
Natural selection, by itself, can only select from existing information, but that existing information can be the result of chance mutations (see previous paragraph). Hence, the combination of natural selection plus random processes can produce additional information.
Spetner’s arguments sound plausible, but a deeper look shows flaws. His measure of information is proportional to substrate, but he doesn’t define substrate. His concept of information cannot be measured experimentally. In fact, even his own example, for instance Xylitol metabolism, does not support his claim.
See here for a nice scientific rebuttal of Spetner’s argument:
http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/information/spetner.html
Who’s afraid of ID? Isn’t the theory of evolution by means of natural selection the scientific theory most corroborated by the evidence found in nature and so certain and robust as the law of gravity? Shame on you pos-modern Darwinians for Darwin himself would love this debate!
Henry…
We know a lot about what natural causes are capable of producing and what they are not capable of producing.  Natural causes are not capable of orchestrating a series of purposeful events toward a distant goal, nor are they capable of adhering to a pre-set, complex, specific pattern.  Such feats are exclusive to agency.
We know a lot about what lies at the base of all life forms.  We knew nothing of the sort in Darwin’s day.  Today we know that even the simplest single celled organism requires vast amounts of complex specified information.  This information exists in the specific arrangement of nucleotides along the DNA double helix.  We know that this DNA is a “code,” a “language,” a “program.”  Pick your exact word, they all work perfectly.  They work perfectly because they are much more than mere analogy – they are perfect descriptions.
We know a lot about the source of vast amounts of complex specified information:  always, without exception, that source is intelligent agency.  We know of no other source capable of generating complex specified information.  Indeed, we know why other candidate sources aren’t capable.
If inferring design from the available data is not a legitimate scientific enterprise, somebody needs to tell the archaeologists.  If it is, then you need to start dealing with it rather than peddling denial.
Here it is in a nutshell:  Symbolic representation.  Only top-down design is capable of such a thing.  There is a 100% satisfying prediction for you.  Certainly it beats the predictions of naturalism.  Like atomism, an eternal universe, and spontaneous generation, to name but a few.
You may not buy into design and that’s your right.  but you have absolutely no rational basis to dismiss it as illegitimate.  When it comes to the origin of life, what needs to be explained is the origin of complex specified information.
Joe,
Yes indeed, we know a lot now.
We know that “complex specified information” is not even well-defined in a way that can be measured. I challenge you to give such an operational definition. I challenge you to show how it can be measured, and what the concrete criteria is to decide from that measurement which cases are design and which are not.
We know of observed examples of information evolving naturally. For example in fungi or bacteria. Those are concrete examples of information evolving.
We know that DNA does not work perfectly. Ever heard of genetic disorders? Hundreds of diseases happen because the DNA is NOT working perfectly. Try to explain that with ID. On the other hand, they are easy to explain if you know that changes in the DNA are not purposeful.
And by the way, Shame on Sophia Lee and the Daily Trojan. I expected better from USC.
Even a bush appointed, conservative, federal juge, (self proclaimed born again Christian), ruled in the Dover Pa trail that ID is nothing more than creationism and is not science. He also said the DI people were fundamentally dishonest.
Judge Jones said.
“The citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy. With that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public school science classroom. “
The comment on the association of ID with religion is simply a response on the title of the Daily Trojan article. It says “not religion” explicitly in the title. That’s false.
Of course naturalism has limits. But there has never been an alternative that systematically produces better results (in terms of making correct predictions). I challenge anybody to give such an alternative.
Of course perception is limited. But again, I challenge anybody to give a (supernatural? non-perception based) alternative that systematically produces better predictions.
Instead of making big statements, try to give a concrete example of an alternative to naturalism. It’s easy to find limits. What’s your alternative?
More specifically, and more relevant to the article, give a concrete example of how Intelligent Design has proven a new theory. In fact, that’s probably too hard. There is an even simpler, but still unsolved, challenge: give a rigorous definition of “Intelligent Design”.
The difference between living and non-living matter is that living matter requires
information (DNA) and a program (instructions) on how to reproduce living matter.
Naturalism cannot explain how information gets added to non-living matter to
produce living matter and then further reproduce that living matter using random
mutations and natural selection. Information requires a designer – we know that
by our experience. ID explains this very well. Even Dawkins has no answer
for how information can be added to non-living matter to produce living matter.
Of course increases in information have been observed to evolve naturally. One example, increased genetic material (hence, increase in information) by evolution has been observed in Iberian freshwater fish. Other examples have been observed in fungi, bacteria, and various other organisms.
From our everyday experience, information requires a designer. But science is much more than our everyday’s experience. Just because you haven’t seen information created naturally in your everyday experience doesn’t mean it cannot happen. You are only arguing from your ignorance. In fact, information can be added by natural processes. See examples above and below.
Dawkins’ ability or inability to give an example is not a measure of the whole field’s ability to give examples. It only reflects what he knows. Perhaps he is just less knowledgeable in this particular issue. But evolution does not rely on one person’s knowledge. There are many examples, given by other authors, of how mutations can add information. For instance, gene duplication, a natural process, can add information, such as observed in yeast. See http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/8/931.pdf
Other than the flurry of ad hominem attacks (making their points inferior because a) they come from Discovery Institute, b) they are less reputable due to their disbelief in unguided natural forces’ creative abilities, c) that the non-darwinist scientific community is -because of a different vision- a priori incapable of presenting science due to the opinions of its popular counterpart, d) that it is creationism in disguise), the case in point still stands. However, the fact that ID’s propositions eventually culminate in an information source is indeed a worthwhile argument to elucidate. I will show now that the fundamental vision of naturalism that divides the “scientific steps” with the “non-scientific steps” is rationally flawed, thereby proving indirectly its only other alternative, supernaturalism.
Naturalism is a religion, not a science, by the simple fact that the only way to prove naturalism is through supernaturalism. In perception, how can you know everything natural is natural? Because it is “just so”? THAT is an irrational religion, as it does not provide a reason to its own basis. In objectivity, “everything was done naturally because nature is all we see” obviously a) makes the statement’s point of view absolute (making the observer perfect) and/or b) implies omniscience (EVERYTHING, huh?). In logic, it cannot explain irrationalities, because rationality is the basis for the concept of nature: therefore irrationality is by definition outside the realm of such an idea. Thus saying that something is “unscientific” because it is non-natural is unscientific in itself…
However, epistemologically, there is only one maximum container for all knowledge: infinity. Describing its “limits” in terms of finite containers (words) as if it had ones (if it does, explain because?) is irrational. However, to say that it is beyond natural knowledge to explain it is not, as it implies the correct hierarchy, that our perception is a part, and inferior in quantification to, the maximum container of reality. So, their derivation that knowledge ends in an ultimate information source Beyond Nature is perfectly rational.
The past is a part of reality way beyond our perception (fossils don’t count, as they, too are in the present, and are only in our mind’s past due to OUR date/age attributions). Therefore, only under naturalism can it allow for simple natural forces to create present realities. Under supernaturalism, however, the story is never set on stone, as there are infinite interpretations to what could have happened, that are beyond human knowledge. That we accept some as superior does not mean they are, and thus, that the scientific community wants to apply a certain vision to the past does not mean that the others are worse.
Plus, even with no evidence, one can be right. Reality is independent of our perceptions, and thus, of ANYTHING we can muster to show our “rightness”. However, how these can be logically accounted for determines the rationality/irrationality of a claim. The fundamental vision of Darwinism is materialism/naturalism, and as such it is intrinsically wrong, even if the mechanism was right. ID can accept the mechanism, but not the fundamental irrationality that founds it.
(A good challenge for naturalism: explain the existence of laws of logic independent of nature without saying they are natural – for it is already acquiesced that That is what’s going to be proven)
Please don’t start the straw-men arguments against religion, which have nothing to do with a fundamental posture for rationality.
Intelligent Design is just a modern argument for the existence of God without explicitly mentioning the word “God”. However, all it’s  leading proponents believe the “designer” is God, more specifically, the God of Christianity.
All the main proponents of Intelligent Design are associated with the Discovery Institute. Here is a quote from that institute’s manifesto: “Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.”  See http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf
William Dembski, one of the biggest proponents of Intelligent Design, wrote: ” … the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.”.  See his book, Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology.
Intelligent Design is NOT exclusively based on empirical evidence. It has so far failed to give a rigorous test to identify intelligence. In fact, it isn’t even able to define the term “intelligent design” rigorously. Even the movie doesn’t give this. I challenge anybody to give a counterexample.
What the scientific community agrees upon may be wrong. But the rejection (in case it is wrong) is also done by agreement within the scientific community. The Ptolemaic system was rejected and corrected, also by agreement within the scientific community. Whether an empirical result is accepted is decided by the scientific community. Supporters of Intelligent Design aka Creationism don’t want to accept this because they know they are overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community, because they have neither rigorous empirical evidence nor well-defined concepts that can be accepted scientifically.
There are problems with the Darwinian theory of evolution. Some are mentioned in this movie. But they do not necessarily (scientifically) imply “Intelligent Design”.  To conclude that it is “intelligent design” requires an additional NON scientific step.
Don’t confuse the implications of a scientific theory with the theory itself, or its methods.  It is the methods employed that determine what is science, not the consequential implications.
To be sure, intelligent design theory can produce powerful arguments for God as understood by Christians (and others), but belief in god/s is neither part of the theory, nor its methods.
Intelligent Design theory is a theory for detecting design in nature, NOT designers.  This is because examples of things which may have been designed are directly observable and scientifically controllable.  The designer/s of a particular thing may or may not have fled the scene, may or may not be identifiable, and may or may not be co-operative with experimenters or observers: in short, they are not necessarily available or amenable to experimentation or observation, whereas the things that they have designed can be.
Intelligent Design theory presents a method for empirically detecting design in certain particular cases where a certain quantifiable characteristic (“specified complexity”) is present to a degree which regularly occurs only in things known to have been designed.  On the basis of the compliant application of this theory to any particular case a ‘design inference’ can be made and physical and logical tests proposed which are appropriate to the case in hand.  (On that basis, for example, DNA has been inferred to be a designed feature of nature, and the test prediction is that most examples of what, on an undirected evolutionary hypothesis, is considered to be “junk DNA” will turn out to be functional DNA).
Of course, a design requires a designer, so a successful inference implies a designer.  Who that designer may be in some cases is likely to be beyond the reach of science alone, but it may be possible to identify certain necessary properties of the designer/s in particular cases, and these could provide a basis for further investigation or test.  In other words, scientifically we may not be able to answer the question “who”, but we may be able to answer the question “what”.
As for a definition of ‘intelligent design’, the term (in various forms) has been in use (in a non-labelling/non-partisan sense) since at least the 18th century by its friends and foes alike, and most people can see what it is intended to convey.  What it means is intentional/wilful/purposeful planning or action originating in a conscious mind.  It can be observationally distinguished from chance and necessity, and with those two constitutes the three exhaustive proximate explanations behind the ‘formal’ causes of anything we observe in nature.
The scientific community is largely opposed to intelligent design theory not because the theory is scientifically deficient, but partly because that community is dominated by a-theists who are not prepared to face up to the failings of the Darwinism upon which their world view rests, and partly because of a well-founded fear that Intelligent Design theory provides a “foot in the door” for non-scientific creationism.
Although the term “intelligent design” has been used for some time, that doesn’t mean it has been well defined, as Thomas claimed.
Thomas said about Intelligent Design:
“Intelligent Design theory presents a method for empirically detecting design in certain particular cases where a certain quantifiable characteristic (”specified complexity”) is present to a degree which regularly occurs only in things known to have been designed.”
But how do you define and test “specified complexity” (as defined by Dembski)?
Let’s look at the procedure.
The way Dembski explains it (see his book), the procedure is eliminative, hence asymmetric: it gives a special treatment to the alternative of “design” (over other alternative explanations). Basically it says: if other explanations fails, then it must be designed by default, without having to prove design directly. That’s a flawed procedure. The burden is on others (non design-based explanations) to prove their case, and if they fail, then it must be “design” – without having to prove design directly. The “design” alternative gets a special advantage in the procedure. See the following article for a good explanation and illustrations why this is a flawed framework:  http://www.talkdesign.org/cs/theft_over_toil
As far as direct test is concerned: so far the idea of “Intelligent design” has not produced any prediction that has already been proven empirically (directly, not in the eliminative way).
Furthermore, the definition of “specified complexity” itself is flawed. The definition relies on the idea that if the probability of something happening is lower, the complexity is higher. Hence, if we can measure the likelihood, that will give a measure the complexity. It conflates definitions of information and complexity. But those are two distinct mathematical conceptd that don’t have a necessary relationship between them. Shannon’s theory of Information does not have implications toward Kolmogorov’ complexity, and vice versa. For example it is possible (in fact, it is easy) to create a simple Turing machine producing an unlikely string. This is an example of something unlikely which can be produced by a simple machinery.
Both the proposed definition and the procedure to test “specified information” are flawed.
There is a very good reason why ID has been widely rejected by the scientific community, including scientists who are theists.
Thomas said “don’t confuse implications of a scientific theory with the theory itself, or its methods”, in an effort to separate the religious motivations of ID proponents with the methods.
So far so good.
However in the last paragraph, he accused scientists of having a-theistic motivations. This is the very mistake of confusing motivations of atheist and the scientific arguments they have.
At least you should be consistent. If you want to take the religious motivation of theists out of the discussion, then do the same for atheists. Or if you want to discuss the theistic or atheistic motivations, do it for both.
I mentioned the religious motivation of ID proponents in a previous comment because they themselves admitted as much. I was not accusing, just quoting from their own sources. On the other hand, the scientific community includes many theists who accept Darwinian evolution. For example, Francis Collins, a leader of the Genome project, is an evangelical christian, and  yet he rejected Intelligent Design.
Henry, you are quick to point out logical fallacies is other people’s arguments, but fail to recognize them in your own.  Your negation of ID because the Discovery Institute promotes it is nothing more then the Guilt by Association fallacy.  Just because a certain organization promotes ID doesn’t mean it’s not science.
Ironically enough, though, the Discovery Institute has identified some pretty empirically sound scientific research studies that serve to support ID.  If you would open your mind just a little you would be able to see that.
My comment on the association of ID and the Discovery institute is not to prove it is wrong, but against the comments from others (including implicitly by the author of the Daily Trojan article) that ID is pure science without any religious motivation. That’s false.
As for how ID is flawed, see my other comments (not the comment on the Discovery Institute).
I didn’t say that you were trying to prove it wrong.  My point is that you are blaming ID for something that religious organizations are doing.  ID is based on science without religious motivation.  Religions are the ones that use ID for religious motivations NOT the ID movement itself.  Just because religious organizations use ID for their agenda doesn’t mean ID itself is guilty of having religious motivations.
Yes, there are religious organizations that use ID for religious purposes, but just because religious organizations use ID for their agenda doesn’t mean that ID is based on religious motivations and not science.  You are still making ID guilty of religiosity by association.  It’s an unfair critique.  You need to critique ID based on it’s scientific underpinnings NOT by the organizations that use ID for their agenda.
ID is not only used by religious organizations for their purposes. But the proponents of ID actually made statements that reveal their religious motivations. For example, Dembsky, one of the biggest proponents of Intelligent Design, wrote: ” … the conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ.”. See his book, “Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology.”
The ID people are not simply being used by religion. The ID people themselves said such things.
Why is it so important to state that intelligent design theory not religious but scientific? It probably matters only because some people want it to be taught as science in school.
It should not need pointing out that a wholly empirical-based theory is science – but, because of its positive religious implications and attraction to theists, and because it threatens their world view and their a-theistic mis-perception of how to do science, the majority of a-theistic scientists (who dominate the scientific community) maintain that intelligent design theory is religion, not science.
Also, having used Darwinism for 150 years as their main weapon to disparage affirmative religion, they are not about to concede the validity of a genuinely scientific approach which threatens their own belief systems and exposes the incapability of Darwinian processes alone to produce or develop biological life.
The point is that Intelligent Design is NOT wholly empirical. The concept of “intelligent design” has not even been rigorously refined in a testable way. I challenge you to give one.
“Intelligent Design” is a property of something in nature of which its formal and/or final causes have been predetermined (at least in part) by the intentional activity of a mind: in other words, its formal and/or final causes result from a mental activity and cannot be attributed to chance and/or necessity alone.
Briefly, Intelligent Design theory proposes that it is a regularity of nature that when an empirically identifiable measure, “specified complexity”, exceeds an independently determined threshold appropriate to the case under consideration, then the property of intelligent design can be reliably inferred to be present.
Both the method itself and putative cases of design can be rigorously tested.
The most popular example of a successfully tested design inference is currently the DNA code in living cells, with the test being that “junk DNA” is shown not to be “junk”.
Another example of a design inference which is physically testable would be the proposal that complex biological machines are designed, one consequential inference being that, since such machines ultimately require that their design terminates in non-material agency, so there must exist non-material media capable of both sustaining mental activity and interacting with the material world.  A suggestive example would be the existence of immaterial minds – so one test would be the (currently more risky) prediction that active minds can be identified in isolation from physical bodies, or, to put it another way, no sustainable evidence will be found that minds are emergent properties of brains/bodies.
Intelligent Design theory would also appear, to me, to predict that in medical science we should be more optimistic about finding ways of defeating harmful bacteria and viruses (instead of assuming that they will always evolve a way round our engineered attempts to overcome them).
For more mundane predictions see Mike Gene’s ‘The Design Matrix’, or Stephen Meyer’s ‘The Signature in the Cell’.
Specified complexity (as defined by Dembsky) has a flawed definition, because it confuses probability and complexity. It tries to measure probability, and infer complexity. But they are not equivalent.
There is no agreed upon “independently determined threshold” for measuring complexity to determine design. In fact, it is not even agreed that complexity is a necessary measure of design at all.
If junk DNA is shown to be not junk, then it falls into the same case as currently known functional DNA, which can be explained by evolution.
I don’t think that currently there is an iota of evidence of immaterial mind.
For additional discussion on specified complexity, see my other comment, a few comments down.
Henry-
Dembski does not “confuse” probability with complexity, he consciously correlates them.
His definition of complexity is coherent, and the correlation with inverse probability provides a useful means of quantification.  (Dembski has also developed a correlation between complexity and classical Shannon information, providing another way to quantify complexity).
Dembski has proposed an independently calculated universal probability bound as a threshold for distinguishing between chance & necessity and inferred “design” (with a value of 10 to the power of -150) in biology.  His value is much more cautious than those proposed by others in the past (which can be as “high” as 10 to the power of -50).  Regarding the method itself, however, different thresholds could be derived for different circumstances and situations, so my statement about the method (as distinct from its controversial application to design in nature/evolution) was intended to be a general one.
Dembski’s proposal for detecting design was originally published as a peer-reviewed philosophical monograph by a world-class university press.  That doesn’t mean it’s correct, or even that it’s generally accepted, but it does mean that it has passed a significant level of competent (indeed, hostile) scrutiny.
Whether the majority of scientists currently accept a particular hypothesis or theory is not the determinator of whether it is actually science.
If Dembski is wrong in proposing that quantified significant specified complexity (in cases where deterministic and probabilistic explanations can be analytically eliminated) signals design, then no-one has yet shown that to be the case.  Those who reject his theory do so because they believe that there are processes of chance & necessity alone which can indeed generate significant specified complexity.  They have yet to demonstrate that to be the case, but if they do, then the show-case theory of intelligent design theory will have been falsified.
For several decades “junk” DNA has been cited as an expectation (or “prediction”) of naturalistic evolutionary theory.  I have no doubt that, should it be found to be otherwise, naturalistic evolutionary theory would be pliable enough to accommodate it (it has shown itself to be adept at avoiding falsification in the past).  However, the point is, that in the face of this claim, the inference to design made by intelligent design theory, in the case of DNA, is that most junk DNA will be found to be actually functional (ie, non-junk).
Thus it provides a prediction and a falsification test for that particular design inference, a way of rigorously testing that particular intelligent design hypothesis.
(It also provides another example of an opportunity for research promoted by intelligent design theory).
Incidentally, as things currently stand undirected evolutionary theory is incapable of explaining the origin of functional DNA by purely naturalistic causes (chance & necessity); and indeed intelligent design theorists claim to be able demonstrate that the functional DNA code is incapable of being explained by such processes alone.
Your claim that “currently there is [not] an iota of evidence of immaterial mind” is exactly my point (which I said was risky).  Here we have a prediction for which there is very little current supporting scientific evidence (so this is another example of a prediction which is genuine – the theory cannot be adjusted after the event to suggest that it predicted it all along).  So, if neuroscientists are able to demonstrate that the mind is merely an emergent property of a material brain/body/other body part, then the prediction would be falsified (and the “who designed the designer” argument of the “new atheists” could then acquire some actual purchase).
Somehow I cannot click reply to put my comment directly under yours, which makes it unconvenient. I will try again to reply tomorrow with a different computer system.
Intelligent Design (ID) theory is not “creationism”, either in its original 19th century sense (referring to science-based rejection of universal common ancestry in favour of ‘special creation’) or in its modern sense (referring to religion-based advocacy of recent special creation in accordance with a literalistic interpretation of the Bible).
ID theory is wholly and exclusively based upon empirical evidence, and employs the principle of uniformitarianism (a principle generally rejected by modern creationists) to determine law-like characteristics which can reliably identify design in nature.
It does not reject modern evolution in the sense of common ancestry over a long earth history, but it does insist that scientific claims are not asserted beyond what the available evidence supports.
Unlike both the modern Darwinist theory of undirected evolution and modern creationism, ID does not employ a methodology (whether methodological/metaphysical naturalism, or biblical inerrancy) which explicitly pre-determines the ‘scientific’ outcome before doing the actual science:  rather, ID proponants insist on applying the ‘Socratic principle’ of following the evidence wherever it may lead.
Also, unlike modern Darwinism, it does not rely upon arguments from authority or ‘scientific’ concensus to establish its validity and stiffle enquiry, but relies upon empirical evidence and analysis alone.  In relation to any theory, what the scientific community agrees upon for decades is no guarantee of its truth (eg, in the past it was agreed upon the Ptolemic description of the solar system, and upon the universal applicability of Newton’s laws of gravitation, for centuries).
The California Science Center was right to pull out.  It’s unfortunate that this reporter accepted the filmmakers’ premise without any further perspectives.
“Intelligent Design” is not, and never has been, science.  It is creationism, wrapped up in a supposedly secular disguise.
No scientist of repute argues that evolution does not take place.  The “debate” mentioned here is strictly political, fueled by religious fervor.  The scientific community has been in agreement for decades.  The fossil record the reporter mentions has indeed been filled in, and continues to get more detailed every day.  Just recently, important discoveries have led to a deeper understanding about our own ancestors, suggesting a far more complex evolution than even we had previously imagined.
I hope that one day, the creationists will realize that God’s hand in evolution is far more impressive than any of their simplistic explanations.
Those who argue that intelligent design isn’t science is speaking from either ignorance or denial.  Scientific evidence for intelligent design is what made Antony Flew change his mind about atheism.  Even Dawkins admits that because of the scientific evidence for design it’s possible that an intelligent designer exists (although he refuses to believe it).
These are atheists saying that intelligent design is a viable scientific explanation of origins.  I can’t believe that anyone would see the evidence and refuse to believe that intelligent design is based on science.
To not realize that is nothing more then closed mindedness.
Intelligent Design is not science because the idea of a “designer” is not falsifiable, one main requirement of being science. The definition of a “designer” does not allow a falsifying observation, since the designer is beyond realm of the observable.
ID offers an answer, “the designer” which does not need further explanation. That’s contrary to science, in which everything should be provisional and open to further correction.
Furthermore, ID is based flawed logic, known as “argument from ignorance” (if it looks to complex, and we don’t have a clue how it came about, then it must have been designed). It is a logical fallacy.
See Robert T. Pennock. Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives. MIT Press.
There is no theory of origins that is falsifiable.  Why do you insist on the impossible for ID, but have different standards for naturalistic theories?  Could it be that you’re biased?  Hmmmm…
When there is no falsifiable evidence it remains a theory.  Science usually begins with a theory and if it can’t be proved it remains a theory until such time that it can be proved.  All cosmic origin explanations remain theories since none of the can be falsifiable, including the naturalistic ones.
We don’t wait to call a theory science until it’s falsified, that’s just silly.  Science is the process of theorizing, testing, quantifying, falsifying and proving.  If we waited until every scientific theory is falsifiable then nothing nothing could ever be called science until it’s proved, including naturalistic theories of origins.
Your idea that ID is based on “argument from ignorance” shows your ignorance about ID (and logical fallacies).  ID is a theory of origins based on the improbability that life began as a result of random chance.
Steve, do you even know what falsifiable means? I’m afraid your comments would embarrass even serious creationists.
Being falsifiable is considered the MAIN requirement for any statement to be considered as scientific. Not falsifiable means it is outside of science. It might still be true, but its truth lies outside of science.
Every single theory of science accepted today is falsifiable. In fact, every single proposal must be falsifiable in order to be considered in a scientific discussion. It is one of the requirement for them to be called scientific at all.
All the hypotheses of origins discussed by scientists are falsifiable. For example Stanley Miller’s ideas are certainly falsfiable.
Your comments on falsifiablity would be rejected not only by scientists, but even by ID proponents. Even ID proponents try hard to say ID is indeed falsifiable, such as to make it scientific. Your comments about falsifiability would embarrass even the ID community.
The probability of life coming out of natural processes so far cannot be calculated in a rigorous way because what is probable or not is not that clear.
(1) Sub-atomic particles are not necessarily observable: physicists test for the existence of such particles (eg., the “Higgs Boson”) by predicting their observable effects and then testing for those effects.  Similarly, intelligent design theorists test for “design”, not the “designer”.  (That is, intelligent design theory aims at providing a method for detecting “design”, not the “designer” because design is easier to observe and scientifically control than any putative designer).
Classical design theory uses two methods for detecting design in nature: analogy and “inference to best explanation” (comparative abduction).  Intelligent design theory primarily employs a particular form of comparative/eliminative abduction which aims at providing a method for detecting design without generating “false positives”.  It can therefore be “falsified” by finding empirical examples of false positives when the method is used properly (the method here being Dembski’s “explanatory filter” used to infer design by detecting significant “specified complexity”).
Intelligent design theory uses both eliminative criteria and positive indicators for detecting design.  Thus both the method and particular examples of its application can be “falsified” by empirically or analytically identifying alleged design cases where the eliminative criteria can be shown to have erroneously excluded the sufficiency of “natural” causes (chance and/or necessity) acting alone (eg., Michael Behe’s examples of the bacterial flagellum or the blood clotting cascade, which a number of opponents of intelligent design theory claim to have been falsified in this way – although Behe repudiates and apparently refutes their claims).
Additionally, specific “design inferences” made using the theory can be “falsified” by demonstrating that predictions based upon those inferences fail (eg, by demonstrating in the case of the design inference for DNA – which predicts that most DNA in a normal cell will be functional – that most DNA is “junk”, or, in the case of functional biological complexity in general, that intelligent activity is always the direct dependent result of a biological process – ie, that biological minds are exclusively produced and operated by brains).
(2) As demonstrated by Godel’s theorem, when considering anything we inevitably come to a point for which there is no further explanation – a “brute fact”.  If a particular method of science takes you straight there, that doesn’t invalidate the science.
However, intelligent design theory does not take you straight there: it detects design, not the designer.  An inference of “design” implies a “designer”, of course.  But far from terminating enquiry at that point, it opens up other lines of investigation (such as searching for other independent examples of design – “consillience”;  or checking design inferences against alternative independent methods of design detection; or testing the physical or logical predictions of particular design inferences; or investigating potential mechanisms by which the designer may have implemented particular cases or classes of design – eg, “front-loaded evolution”;  or investigating the design principles upon which nature works – “reverse engineering”, if you like;  or even attempting to characterise the nature of the designer ).
Indeed, the whole of modern western science was based originally upon the concept that natural laws point to a designer – the Creator God whose works in nature point to the Creator himself (independently of any supernatural revelation such as The Bible) and that therefore the world can and should be understood by investigating it on the basis that it operates according to such laws of nature.  In other words, attributing nature to design encourages scientific investigation rather than terminating it.
(3) Whilst the claim that intelligent design theory is a science stopper is palpably false, in no way can the same can be rationally claimed for “scientific naturalism” (where certain conclusions are reached and certain lines of enquiry are ruled out by definitional fiat in advance of doing the actual science).
Henry, on the question of the provisional nature of scientific conclusions, perhaps you should be addressing your corrections to the a-theistic evolutionists who run the National Academy of Sciences rather than to proponents of intelligent design theory.  According to the NAS, scientific explanations must be exclusively naturalistic: there’s nothing provisional (or rational) in their insistence on this.  Nor does their atual use of the word “fact” to describe the theory of naturalistic evolution encourage us to think that they only hold the theory provisionally (despite their esoteric definition of the word “fact” to actually mean provisional conclusion).
As for intelligent design theory, it is just as provisional as anyother genuine scientific theory: its central claim, that design in nature can be empirically detected by identifying and quantifying significant specified complexity in cases where deterministic and probabilistic explanations can be analytically eliminated, is testable; and intelligent design theorists have already modified (slightly) the concept of “irreducible complexity” (a special class of “specified complexity”) in the face of counter examples which could generate “false positives”.
(4) Intelligent design theory does NOT remotely employ an “argument from ignorance”.  It identifies law-like indicators of known design in nature and then applies those indicators to other subjects to see if they also can be inferred to have been designed.
It does not argue that since we don’t know how something could have formed by natural causes (chance and necessity) alone, therefore it must have been designed (the only identified alternative to chance and necessity), but that (a) we DO KNOW that certain features in nature CANNOT have been caused by natural processes alone, (b) we DO KNOW that certain features characterise known examples of design, and (c) we DO KNOW that ONLY intelligent agency has been identified in nature as being capable of causing certain effects.
In other words, intelligent design theorists do not employ a method based upon mere absence of evidence (ignorance), but rather, a method which combines evidence of absence with positive evidence of presence.
Evolutionary naturalism, on the other hand, routinely employs the fallacies of affirming the consequent (by seeking exclusively confirming evidence for undirected evolution whilst failing to test for alternative interpretations of that evidence) and begging the question (by presupposing exclusively naturalistic causes before doing the science).

Ummm…  wow, you completely missed the point.  I’m saying that you are sticking to the highest (and unattainable) standards for the position you oppose.   It’s classic bias.  If you require falsifiability for ID you must also require it for naturalistic theories of origins.
Ultimately, I think you are confused about falsifiability.  Falsafiability is not necessary for something to be considered science.
All that a theory needs to be considered science is criticizability NOT falsifiability.  You should read up on Karl Popper. Popper stressed that “unfalsifiable statements are still very important for science and are often contained in scientific theories as unfalsifiable consequences.”
String theory, for example is currently criticizable but not falsifiable.  Does that mean that the work of theoretical physicist expert in string theory Dr. Michio Kaku isn’t doing science?  Of course not! I challenge you to call Dr. Kaku and tell him that what he is doing isn’t science because it’s not falsifiable.  How absurd!
By the way, in a recent interview Dr. Kaku stated “we are on the verge of seeing the mind of god.” and no, Dr. Kaku isn’t speaking from a religious perspective.
Sure, falsifiability is an effective methods by which theories can be criticized, but it’s still just a special case of the much more general notion of criticizability.  To require falsifiability in ALL science is to have unrealistic expectations.
So to answer your question, yes, I know what falsifiable means and no I’m not in the least embarrassed, well, I’m a bit embarrassed for you, but not for me.  Come on, this is philosophy of science 101 stuff!
Steve,
All the theories of science follow the standard of falsifiabilty. At least a theory should include statements that are falsifiable, plus other statements that are consequences of such statements. So creationist ideas should follow the same standard.
A theory might contain some statements that are not falsifiable, but they are consequences of other statements that are, or they motivate statements that are.
There are numerous examples of falsifiable statements within evolution. For example see Ridley’s textbook on Evolution.
On the other hand, ID is not only not falsifiable, it’s basic ideas are not even well-defined. For example, it often relies on probability to show “specified complexity”. But what is the cutting point of probability such that beyond it we should assume it must be designed? Furthermore, how exactly do you calculate those probabilities? These basic issues are not even well defined, let alone falsifiable.
You are right, string theory is hard to test (at least with current tools). And in fact, some have actually questioned whether it could be called scientific. Those critics include prominent physicists such as Sheldon Glashow and others. But notice, it is only hard to test, not in principle impossible. Furthermore, since string theory is based on quantum mechanics and relativity, which are falsifiable, it is indirectly falsifiable. Any example that falsify relativity or quantum mechanics will falsify string theory indirectly.
Kaku might mention God, but you have to be careful to interpret what he means by God. It is similar to how we know that Einstein mentions God in some often quoted statements, but further reading makes it clear he does not mean a designer God. Similarly, don’t take Kaku’s statement literally.
Antony Flew has given different arguments on the issue of intelligent design, sometimes retracting what he has said before. Although he still claims to believe in God, it is not clear what his current argument is on the issue of intelligent design. See  http://secweb.infidels.org/?kiosk=articles&id=369
Besides, even if Flew believes there is scientific evidence for intelligent design, his argument fails to convince most (almost all) scientists. It’s just his personal opinion.
Steve, can you give me a quote that “Dawkins admits that because of the scientific evidence for design it’s possible that an intelligent designer exists”. ?  I doubt he said that. You need to give me a quote.
One I can think of off the top of my head is in Ben Stein’s movie Expelled  And it’s not something Ben Stein said, it comes from Dawkins’ own mouth during an interview.
I saw Ben Stein’s movie. I don’t recall that quote. Not only that, it is a very unlikely quote, considering Dawkins’ position. Give me the time in the movie where this quote appears, so I could check it. Otherwise I have to conclude you are making this up.
This is a response to Henry just below this.  I can’t click on his “Reply” link for some reason.

My Reply:
So you are refusing to believe that Dawkins said that unless I provide the exact coordinates in the movie so you can check?  One doesn’t get much more closed minded then that.  I’m not going to do your research for you.  If you don’t believe me then fine, I don’t really care.  You can stay closed minded if you want.  If you want to check it out for yourself then feel free I don’t really care if you believe me or not.  I will tell you though, since you seem to have a need for people to state the obvious, it’s in the part of the video when Stein interviews Dawkins (towards the end of the movie).
Hey Steve,
Two things.
First of all, the person who makes a statement has to prove it. You made the statement about Dawkins saying things. You should prove it. Yes, you should do research, if you want to make a statement. That’s normal procedure in arguments. You don’t ask others to find the proof for your statement. You made the statement, you prove it. No proof, your statement is ignored.
Second, I actually checked the video, as I said before. I did the research, although it should’ve been your job. And I didn’t find that statement as you claimed. So I could already say you are wrong. But I was just trying to be nice and ask perhaps I missed something (although I checked) and I am giving you the chance to prove your point by showing the time, in case I missed it. But fine, you refused even to do your job or to take the chance to prove your case.
Okay then, since I did check it and it’s not there, then you are wrong. As simple as that.
Antony Flew’s position on intelligent design is not clear. He has given different arguments on the issue of intelligent design, sometimes retracting what he has said before. Although he still claims to believe in God, it is not clear what his current argument is on the issue of intelligent design. 
Besides, even if Flew believes there is scientific evidence for intelligent design, his argument fails to convince most (almost all) scientists. It’s just his personal opinion.
Wait, you’re admitting that Flew believes in God but you are discounting him because it’s not clear (to you) what his current argument is on the issue of ID? That’s a biased view.
His view on ID is based on his study of DNA and the improbability that it is the result of random chance.
Yet biologists’ investigation of DNA “has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved,” Flew says in the new video, “Has Science Discovered God?”
See: http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/6688917/
Our discussion is not about believe in God, but about how ID proves God. Hence, if Flew is not clear about ID, then his opinion about God is discounted, as far as our discussion is concerned.
You gave me a link from 2004. That’s 5 years ago. It’s only his opinion at that time. But Flew has changed his opinion several times over the years. Often retracting his earlier opinions. See here a track record of Flew’s various opinions on ID, collected from a large number of his interviews and writings over many years. See how he changes his mind.  http://secweb.infidels.org/?kiosk=articles&id=369
Again, I can’t click on Henry’s “Reply” link.  This is a response to his post below…

No, our discussion isn’t how ID proves God.  That’s not even what the article is about.  No ID proponent I know of (including myself) claims that ID proves God’s existence.  I think this is your fatal flaw.  ID proponents claim that ID proves design NOT God.  Thomas already spoke about this:
To be sure, intelligent design theory can produce powerful arguments for God as understood by Christians (and others), but belief in god/s is neither part of the theory, nor its methods.
I’m not arguing for the existence of God so if you wish to argue that point I’m not interested.  The article is about ID not God.  You are trying to make the argument about something it’s not which is a Red Herring Fallacy.  As I said before, you need to critique ID based on it’s scientific underpinnings rather then try to discount it by associating it with those who use ID for their religious agendas.

In the ’90s, girls and boys raced to boom boxes to listen to the latest mix tape made by their significant others.
But in a generation where iPods have replaced CDs and cassette tapes, the personalized compilations in which teenagers poured their souls have turned into mechanical playlists created by the genius button in iTunes.
Night patrol · Late Night Tales: Snow Patrol is the 22nd album in the series, which has featured  Zero 7, The Flaming Lips and Air in the past. - Photo courtesy of The Muse Box
Bridging the gap between past and present, Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody and keyboardist Tom Simpson return to the studio to record a piece of their hearts without completely abandoning the advantages of modern technology.
Released Tuesday, the 22nd album in the Late Night Tales series mixes together some of the duo’s favorite music, which gives audiophiles a taste of Snow Patrol’s low-key sound without actually having to completely invest in the band.
As a collection of compilations, the series shines a light into the musical world of a myriad of DJs, recording artists and bands after dark.
Artists are invited to create their own tracklist, specially selected and mixed for the series, as well as record their own rendition of a favorite song.
Reflecting the experienced musical tastes of two former club DJs, Late Night Tales: Snow Patrol is a throwback to the band’s many inspirations. Lightbody and Simpson take you on a journey through their music — a land where trance-inducing voices replace soothing ocean waves and rainstorms are substituted by celestial beats.
Following the theme of after-hour madness, the 19-track album will tickle your ears with after-party mood music that is meant to calm the nerves yet retain an appropriate level of energy for that long car ride home.
Although the selection of songs might individually pique interest — many with vibrant beats fused with electronic sound upgrades — together, it only serves to confuse the listener.
The album begins strong with Captain Beefheart’s “Observatory Crest,” a narrative song about driving to a special place after a concert, but soon falters — drastically.
Beefheart’s avant-garde sound is followed by A Tribe Called Quest’s “Midnight,” a rap that breaks the flow of the entire album in merely the second track.
Despite the attempt to keep energy high, the atypical lineup of songs consists of slow melodies that lull the listener to sleep. A string of songs with slow beats is often broken up by a song with somewhat faster slow beats. And when the compilation starts to pick up speed, the momentum is abruptly halted by random insertions.
Transitions throughout are well-mixed but lack a level of sophistication and consistency necessary for a rehash of old music.
The first 15 seconds and the last 30 seconds of most songs — at least for the earlier tracks — are dedicated to mixing in a smooth transition, where one song fades out, and the other fades in.
After the first few tracks, however, the monotony sets in and the supposed late-night illumination reveals only the techniques of undeveloped DJs still learning how to blend their own creative energy into songs that aren’t theirs.
Lightbody and Simpson take the tact of using the last line and beats of the previous song, repeating it and then matching it up with the next song. On the same transition, they repeat the same technique backwards, creating a cacophony that sounds more like an orgy of notes than a smooth segue.
By the end of the album, transitions are barely audible, making rough song selections even more noticeable.
The transition between “That’s Us/Wild Combination” and “Eanie Meany,” however, marries celestial voices with psychedelic beats into a perfect harmony, making it hard notice where one song ends and the other begins.
For true Snow Patrol fans, the band covers Inxs’ ’80s hit “New Sensation,” putting its own acoustic spin on the pop song. A slowdown of the beats and echo effects throughout the chorus infuses Snow Patrol’s distinctly alternative sound.
But overall, Late Night Tales: Snow Patrol fails to reach the band’s usually infectious energy, and instead leaves listeners underwhelmed by the musicians and sound they thought they knew.
i think this review is pretty misleading, i think the album is great and well worth checking out, the Air release in this series was also excellent

Each time we take a bite out of a store-bought (oftentimes hormone-pumped) chicken leg, we are making — consciously or not — an ethical choice. To eat meat, or not to eat meat — that is now a valid ethical question.
Last Friday at Ground Zero Performance Café (unbearably hip, as always), the USC Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics sponsored the second in a three-part series of Coffeehouse Conversations on Practical Ethics. Free food — including, unsurprisingly, an excess of vegetarian sandwiches — was provided.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Professor Sharon Lloyd moderated a panel of two fellow professors and a graduate student — Professor Edwin McCann, Professor John Strauss and Kory DeClark, a graduate student studying philosophy — as they chewed and ruminated, merrily or otherwise, on “The Ethics of Eating: Is It Possible to Eat with a Clear Conscience?”
McCann was the philosopher of the panel, Strauss was the economist and DeClark was the inquisitive student.
(Full disclosure: I take a class with McCann, and DeClark is the teacher’s assistant in that class; but fear not, dear reader, the leniency of my pen. I have no problem skewering their meaty — and not so meaty — arguments.)
In the first place, we should consider it a privilege to be able to speak frankly about the so-called ethics of eating. In much of the world, people subsist on the most meager portions of what Americans wouldn’t even consider real food.
For those with little resources, there are no ethical implications of eating; they eat what they can get, and they eat to survive. This notion of the ethics of eating is really a rich man’s dilemma — but an important dilemma nonetheless, as DeClark repeatedly emphasized.
DeClark, radically pro-vegetarian, spoke passionately on behalf of our furry and feathered friends, regurgitating familiar facts and figures to support his minority position: Animals, like humans, have rights because they can suffer.
As privileged Americans who do not need to eat meat, it is high time we devote serious thought to this notion of animal suffering. DeClark’s point is no longer as radical as it once was.
Strauss — whose contribution to the panel was mostly a tangential discussion of genetically modified food and other agricultural innovations — was wrong to dismiss DeClark as a bombastic activist. DeClark asked the right question: What are we doing — we who prize liberty above all — imprisoning helpless hens in small, vastly overcrowded, artificially lit cages, and forcing them to spend the whole of their pathetic lives pumping out egg after egg after egg?
(One lesson from that: All claustrophobics should be animal rights activists.)
It boils down to the “out of sight, out of mind” problem. Whipping up scrambled eggs each morning, few of us think seriously about the chickens that laid them, no doubt under inhumanly stressful circumstances. And those few who do make it a point of buying “cage-free” or “free-range” eggs ought to know that those labels are — if not for all intents and purposes — lies and shocking misrepresentations of an inconvenient reality.
However, DeClark undermined his position by calling all those who eat meat by choice — the vast majority of Americans, myself included — “morally reprehensible.” One can be carnivorous and still think the treatment of chickens in our factory farms is ethically bankrupt. To think these positions are mutually exclusive is to create a false dilemma.
McCann, philosophically anti-vegetarian, countered DeClark by saying he “puts [his] interests above a very large number of organisms,” and dismissed DeClark’s utilitarian liberationist ideology (à la Peter Singer) as “unqualified and universalistic.”
From a purely philosophical standpoint, McCann said, if we concede that the suffering of chickens is wrong, then we must also abandon antibiotic treatment, for that presumably causes the suffering of bacteria.
Obviously, McCann warps the point. Bacteria, we can presume, do not suffer as chickens or pigs or calves suffer; that is too big a leap to make. Using bacteria to prevent the spread of diseases is not like caging up chickens in small, dark places for weeks on end — which is not only cruel, but avoidable.
Of course, there are several economic and social reasons as to why we can’t put an end to current farming practices in one fell swoop, however deplorable they may be; but that does not mean we should simply accept animal cruelty as a fait accompli.
People do care, as evidenced by the passage last year of Proposition 2 in California, which will ensure, among other things, some leg room for our chickens by 2015 — a minor gain, but a step in the right direction.
And who knows? Perhaps vegetarianism will be the future — maybe meat eating will eventually be regarded as a repulsive notion. It isn’t too farfetched a notion. Save the chickens, save the world.

Sports are very unpredictable.
Just ask a Vegas bookie about USC’s home loss to Stanford in 2007.
Or about the likelihood of Notre Dame’s fourth quarter near-comeback against the Trojans three weeks ago.
Or even about the chance that a home underdog would beat the then-No. 5 team in the nation by 27 points.
But if there is anything certain about sports, it’s that a team will suffer injuries.
Every team does, and a big part of what determines a given team’s success is the collective reaction to injuries over the course of a season.
But at the end of that season, frequently the biggest indicator of relative success is how many of a team’s expected starters finish the season in a starting role.
And no matter how many times coaches tell you that you can have rookies, freshmen and inexperienced players take over for your veteran expected starters, nothing compares to having as many starters as possible actually start.
The more, the better. The fewer, the worse.
Just take a look at this year’s Trojans.
Let’s estimate how many collective games have been missed by starters or significant contributors for USC this season and try to evaluate the job done by the fill-ins.
At quarterback, true freshman starter Matt Barkley sat out the Washington game with a bruised throwing shoulder. Redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp made his debut as a starter and was widely blamed for the 16-13 loss.
Senior running back Stafon Johnson has missed four games since suffering a tragic weightlifting injury to his throat and is out for the remainder of the season, although redshirt junior Allen Bradford has performed admirably in his absence.
Redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili has been out for the last two games with a dislocated right shoulder. Sophomore D.J. Shoemate has stepped in and blocked well, but hasn’t caught a pass.
At receiver, juniors Ronald Johnson and David Ausberry have missed a combined eight games. Redshirt freshman Brice Butler has grown into a fourth receiver role, but a lack of targets has admittedly hurt the Trojans’ offense thus far.
Senior tight end Anthony McCoy missed the Oregon game with a sprained ankle. McCoy had caught seven passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns in the last two games, but his replacement, sophomore Rhett Ellison, didn’t catch a single ball.
The offensive line has been the least affected, but still, junior center Kristofer O’Dowd — USC’s offensive lineman of the year in 2008 — sat out the season opener and the last two games, as he is recovering from a dislocated kneecap.
On the defensive line, projected starter Armond Armstead was out for the first five games and is now hurt again with a broken wrist. At the opposite end, junior Everson Griffen, was hobbling this week in practice with turf toe. For the most part, young defensive ends Nick Perry and Malik Jackson have played well, but the defensive line completely collapsed against Oregon.
Junior weakside linebacker Malcolm Smith has missed two games and is likely to miss more with a shoulder injury. One of the backups who could replace him, redshirt sophomore Jordan Campbell, missed four contests but could return this week.
Besides expected starter redshirt junior Shareece Wright’s academic ineligibility switching around the defensive backfield, the Trojans have also had to deal with senior safety Taylor Mays missing a game, junior safety Drew McAllister missing two, and serious injuries to nickel and dime contributors junior Marshall Jones and redshirt freshman Brian Baucham — totaling nine missed games.
Count them all up, and that’s 42 man-games  missed by key contributors out of a total of eight games this season.
Compare it to UCLA’s 11 defensive starters missing a combined one game.
The traditional coach-speak book says in these situations that other, less-experienced players will step up to fill the veterans’ void.
“We have a great history here of guys stepping up and playing really well and coming through,” USC coach Pete Carroll said in his Tuesday press conference. “That’s the only way we know how to expect that to happen. And that’s what we’re counting on. Nobody’s come here to just sit around.”
And few will be able to.
There exists a certain point where injuries ravaging a team become more than just setbacks. At some point, they become part of a team’s collective psyche.
How do you know when? It happened against Oregon.
USC did not play with its traditional fire. You saw guys shy away from hits routinely. Oregon weapons quarterback Jeremiah Masoli and running back LaMichael James literally ran over the Trojans on multiple occasions.
It’s the point where mental meets physical and physical meets mental.
“It’s not just the mental things, it is the physical side and getting them ready well so we can play,” Carroll said. “We’re doing it, and I think these guys are pretty resilient.”
Only the coming weeks will tell.

Humans love to copy each other. From little toddlers mimicking the words of their parents to adults following the latest fashion trends, it seems that people have the need to do what everyone else is doing in order to feel accepted.
Combining the fields of psychology and environmental science, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District has begun to use this need-to-conform concept to encourage its residents to become more energy efficient by sending bills — called “home energy reports” — that compare their own energy costs to those of their neighbors.
This new concept of using regular human tendencies to further energy efficiency is a creative approach that is necessary to combat the problem of rising greenhouse gas emissions.
Rather than forcing people to save energy or bombarding them with neverending facts and figures, this simple method of showing citizens the possible benefits of becoming energy efficient gets the point across.
The home energy report also contains several simple tips and suggestions to the homeowner on how to become energy efficient. Comparisons in the report are also made based on home size and heating type, thereby comparing only similar types of homes.
The SMUD began this new program in April; now it claims that out of the 35,000 homes that received home energy reports, 75 percent have begun using energy-efficient methods to cut energy use, resulting in an average savings of $40 per household.
The California State Legislature, along with the support of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, has signed SB 488 into law, which will have all California utility agencies create home energy report programs for its customers by July of next year.
Approximately 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity use in homes.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Alex Laskey, president and co-founder of the energy efficiency software firm OPOWER, claimed that if home energy reports were used nationally, the result would be the equivalent of taking 6 million cars off the road.
Where many energy-saving tactics have failed, this one might succeed with the simple application of psychology.
When people realize that some of their friends and neighbors are saving money by applying several easy energy cost cutting measures, it is only natural that others will begin to copy them.
This tendency is especially visible in today’s dismal economic situation, as many households are trying to save every possible dollar. Most people try to cut their spending on luxury items and other objects, but fail to realize they can also save money by simply regulating their energy use.
Although the start of such programs and the passage of SB 488 deserve to be praised, the use of home energy reports needs to be expanded to include not only individual homes but companies, universities and buildings as well. Companies that are not energy efficient might begin copying those companies that are in order to save money as well.
Universities such as USC can compare their energy use to that of other universities and therefore understand how environmentally friendly (or not) they truly are. Students have the potential to get involved in order to help create programs for student apartments in order to reduce their energy consumption.
Student-run environmental organizations can begin to take a more active and direct role in reducing carbon emissions in the lives of students on campus — students are prime targets, both in terms of individuals looking to save money and in terms of following “the need to conform” psychological principle. The environmental science and psychology departments in particular could join together and devise a plan similar to home energy reports for USC and its buildings.
Energy efficiency is in the best interest of every individual — both economically and environmentally speaking. Let’s start spreading the word.

So it appears former USC men’s basketball coach Tim Floyd didn’t fall off the face of the earth after all.
The discredited coach, who resigned last June amidst allegations of NCAA violations, was caught on camera breaking up a fight at an unknown casino cafeteria. The video, posted on deadspin.com, can be viewed at http://deadspin.com/5396383/when-ladies-start-throwing-chairs-in-a-casino-cafeteria-its-time-to-call-tim-floyd.
Floyd, a native of Hattiesburg, Miss., has not been seen or heard from since he resigned.

A recent survey released by the Undergraduate Student Government has students excited about the possibility of a fall break or a longer Thanksgiving holiday. Even if change is made, however, students will not be around to see it.
The survey, released Oct. 28, asked students whether they would favor extending Thanksgiving break or creating a fall break. But even with overwhelming response — about 2,000 students have already taken the survey — a vacation would not materialize until at least 2015.
“Calendars are finalized several years in advance,” Kenneth Servis, the dean of Academic Records and Registrar, wrote in an email. “A finalized calendar could be changed but it would be highly unusual.”
The Academic Calendar Committee, which includes students, faculty and staff and is chaired by Servis, plans out the yearly calendar, which is then approved by Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max Nikias. Academic calendars are currently set through the summer of 2015.
In addition, adding a fall break or extending the Thanksgiving break would require lengthening the academic calendar because President Steven B. Sample has mandated that each semester must have at least 72 instructional days, Servis said.
“There has to be a trade-off,” Servis said. “We can, for instance, start earlier in August or go later.”
Andrew Matson, director of academic affairs for USG, said the administration had approached USG last year to see if students would be interested in having either the Wednesday before Thanksgiving off or getting a fall break sometime between the first day of classes and Thanksgiving, which prompted USG to conduct the survey.
“One major advantage of a fall break is that students get a little bit of time to get caught up on school work as well as some important relaxation time,” Matson said. “In our current schedule, we go from Labor Day until Thanksgiving without so much as a three-day weekend, and I think that students need some time away from classes both to catch up and to decompress.”
Adding days to Thanksgiving break would maximize students’ ability to relax, said to Donna Spruijt-Metz, an expert in adolescent psychosocial development and health and an assistant professor of research in the Keck School of Medicine. She added that an ideal fall break would be at least a week long.
“The evidence is pretty conclusive that longer breaks are more helpful than shorter breaks,” Spruijt-Metz said. “If there’s going to be a break, it should be a meaningful amount of time that really lets students relax.”
Several students said they would appreciate a longer break not only to reduce stress, but also because it could make traveling more affordable.
“It saves students a lot of money on plane tickets to book flights earlier in the Thanksgiving week,” said Whitney Gaines, a sophomore majoring in political science and creative writing.
Even if USC decided to create a three-day weekend fall break, some students at other universities with a similar holiday complained that such a break was not long enough.
“I definitely want the fall break to last longer because ours was only a three-day weekend,” said Eric Danielson, a sophomore majoring in accounting and entrepreneurship at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. “It didn’t seem like much of a break to me. I would love a four- or five-day break.”
One disadvantage of a fall break, however, is that it might interrupt students’ schedules.
Caitlin Oriel, a sophomore majoring in growth and structure of cities at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Penn., said her school’s weeklong fall break in October interrupted her routine.
“I liked the break because I was worn out and needed to catch up on sleep,” Oriel said. “However, it did interrupt my schedule and my studies. It was very hard to motivate myself to study during the week off, so I felt behind when I came back.”
Students will have to wait and see whether the university decides to extend Thanksgiving break or add a fall break, but most students said they would welcome a change in the calendar.
“Everyone looks forward to Thanksgiving, but it seems so far away,” said Kimberly Morris, a freshman majoring in communication. “I just like to see my family and friends and enjoy time off from school and sports.”

Although political activism at USC has fallen since the wave of excitement and participation that propelled Barack Obama to the presidency last Election Day, momentum is expected to grow as the race for governor in California gets underway in the coming year.
Press coverage during last year’s election often highlighted youth involvement as a distinguishing characteristic of the election. USC’s campus also saw a heightened level of student involvement with dozens of panels and rallies, but the political activity has mostly died down in the year since the election.

“It’s only natural that there’s going to be a much greater level of enthusiasm and participation during a campaign as opposed to afterward,” said Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute for Politics.
The leaders of various political groups on campus said the presidential election brought out political activism on campus because of the feeling students have that their actions would had an actual impact.
“A lot of people that were previously apolitical got more involved because they felt like this is the time to get involved,” said Alexa Ekman, USC College Republicans president.
Aja Heisler, external communications director for USC College Democrats, also said students were more inclined to support people during elections than issues.
“It was to be expected that interest as well as activism on campus would decrease after the election,” Heisler said. “Elections are what get people really passionate.”
Between elections, though, the level of political activity tends to focus on issues, which can often lead to smaller student turnouts.
“After a year, people don’t care that much anymore,” said Lisa Zhao, vice chair of USC’s chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group, a bipartisan organization that focuses on legislative issues. “It’s not a long-term thing.”
Still, despite less involvement, a number of organizations continue to hold political events on campus in an effort to encourage involvement.
Over the next week, USC’s campus will see a discussion about Obama’s first year in office` organized by the Unruh Institute of Politics, a Proposition 8 open mic sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Assembly and a USC College Republicans event featuring political writer David Horowitz.
“During this past year, a lot of students have seemed to get really passionate about the issues that Obama has presented,” said Yvette Ferrer, executive board member of the Political Student Assembly, which regularly sponsors political events on campus. “Slowly, we’re starting to see more political organizations and students taking pride in issues and making sure that their voices are being heard.”
And with the gubernatorial election approaching, USC is once again likely to experience a spike in student involvement, Ferrer said.
“Every time an election is going to happen, there is going to be an increase of political activism,” she said. “Probably within the next two months, we’ll see an increase in people wanting to be involved and head these student groups — we don’t even have Students for Whitman and Students for Poizner yet.”
Even though next year’s election will be more relevant to in-state students, Ferrer, who is from Texas, said the controversial propositions that were voted on last November and the state budget crisis could still capture student interest.
According to Schnur, gubernatorial campaigns don’t usually achieve the same level of excitement as presidential ones, but USC will still see more political involvement.
“As the 2010 governor’s race kicks into full gear, my guess is you’ll see a very pronounced increase in the level of political activity on campus,” he said.
The only student group founded to support a gubernatorial candidate was Students for Gavin Newsom, though the candidate recently dropped out of the race.
“Now that Newsom’s not running, there are rumors that other Democrats will get in the race as well. As the field of candidates finalizes, the level of student involvement is going to grow,” Schnur added.
how is politics defined this narrowly as what democrats or republicans do??
what about all the work of students for justice in palestine???

When President Steven B. Sample steps down in August, only a handful of students — past and present — will have ever interacted with him directly. But even those who never met Sample recognize his influence on their time at the university, and those who did meet and work with him say Sample’s successor will have big shoes to fill.
Sample, who announced his retirement Monday, acknowledged that his interaction with the student body was limited. He said he connected with students mostly through his class, The Art and Adventure of Leadership, which he co-taught with Marshall professor and management expert Warren Bennis.

“My big interaction with students is my teaching,” Sample said. “And the whole university is built on the relationship between this student and this professor … Each year I have known a group of students intimately, where I was the real professor … That was more important in terms of my understanding our student body than simply going to a lot of receptions.”
Students who have taken Sample’s class said Sample inspired with his strong leadership skills and direct nature.
“He would talk about being a leader and being free, and he said, ‘Don’t limit yourself. Think free and you’ll come up with an answer that’s original,’” said Ashwin Appiah, Undergraduate Student Government treasurer and a senior majoring in computer science and business administration who took Sample’s class last year. “Those kinds of stories where he refers back to his experiences really made us put things into perspective and look at things differently.”
Other students said they would remember more than just Sample’s teaching.
“I was raised a Trojan my whole life, and when I was in high school, I took my grades so seriously and I thought I would be going to an Ivy League school, and I considered USC that caliber,” said USG President Holden Slusher, a senior majoring in business administration who took Sample’s class last year. “I don’t know if I would have chosen to go here if he hadn’t made USC as prestigious as it is now.
The same leadership skills Sample taught in his class guided the school’s climb to the top of the academic realm — the change students said impacted them the most.
“If he hadn’t done the things he’s been doing for the last 15 years, I don’t think I would have even considered coming to USC,” said Kevin Flynn, a senior majoring in civil engineering. “Good academics, a great athletics program; [USC] seemed to have things you could find separately at several schools but not all together at one school.”
Tony Jercinovich, the former vice president of USG and a 2008 graduate, echoed this sentiment.
“Where USC was 19 years ago and where it is now is a very different place in terms of its academic rigor,” Jercinovich said. “I wouldn’t have applied there. He started doing merit scholarships, and I was fortunate enough to be a Presidential Scholarship recipient, and that was a major factor in my decision to go there.”
Nick Hamada, president of the Interfraternity Council and a senior majoring in international relations, also said Sample’s academic push directly affected his decision to attend USC.
“He had a tremendous effect on me before I even became a student at this university,” Hamada said. “I remember being a senior in high school, and one of the things that really jumped out at me about USC was its emphasis about pursuing multiple academic paths. It’s neat because on the one hand he’s trying to build a world-class research university, but that’s not to say he doesn’t have an appreciation for liberal arts education. He’s a renaissance scholar himself.”
Hamada, who also took Sample’s class, said he also respected Sample’s leadership style and qualities.
“What you see is what you get. He’s very candid, he’s very open, he’s very honest,” Hamada said. “I was astounded by the candor and the honesty, and I think that’s how he can build trust and get people on with his position and inspire people.”
Students agreed that, when Sample steps down in August, the next president will face a tremendous task.
“He’s a visionary in everything he does,” Slusher said. “Whoever comes here will have large shoes to fill … It’s going to be hard to replace Dr. Sample.”
Sample will be missed, students said, and his years at USC will leave a lasting impression on the school.
“It’s a fitting end because we’re starting a new chapter in USC history with the opening of the new campus center, and with a new president taking charge of that, we’ll be going to a new generation,” Appiah said.

This is not a film about Michael Jackson’s life; his eccentricities and tribulations are never addressed.
Neither is this film about his death; not once did it mention Jackson’s untimely end.
This film is simply a compilation of segments of rehearsal footage for his then-upcoming concert, This Is It. And the film, more concert than documentary, is one that demands to be seen on the big screen.
This Is It opens in true documentary fashion, featuring interviews with Jackson’s background dancers professing their love and gratitude to Jackson and his music. Although this portion is heartfelt, what comes next makes the film worthwhile.
There he is, 50-year-old Jackson, his movements just as sharp and innovative as ever, not even breaking a sweat. At one point, the choreography requires him to throw a tantrum on the floor, throw punches and kicks and then roll on his back and kick his legs high up in the air, his weight supported only by his upper arms. He does this move quite energetically. Twice.
As Jackson begins to sing, his voice does not falter. His notes ring out as clearly as if he recorded them as a young man. His vocal improvisations are perfectly in tune — no lip-syncing in sight.
Of course, Jackson has other signature moves in his razor-sharp choreography repertoire. Yes, there is crotch-grabbing, although one of the choreographers does explain to the background dancers that it is more of an illusionary hand motion than an actual grab.
The intimate elements do not end there. There are at least three songs in which Jackson either stares longingly at, serenades, suggestively grabs and/or shows amorous affection toward a woman half his age. But that’s showbiz.
Jackson seemed none too worse for the wear. He never looked over-exerted or stressed. His only injuries seemed to occur on his fingertips, as evidenced by the constant presence of band-aids, perhaps because of his fondness for snapping.
Jackson was involved in everything: auditions, lighting, video segments, special effects, editing, music, you name it. Jackson is a perfectionist because he assumes, accurately, that he knows what the audience wants — songs they know, sung how they were recorded.
“We’re going to sing the songs the fans want to hear,” Jackson said in the film.
This was often frustrating for the musicians, who wanted to add their own flair to the concert. But Jackson did allow himself and the musicians to play with the preludes and endings of songs, probably because at that point the audience isn’t singing along.
Jackson knows all the beats and keys of his recordings. He also has an acute sense of timing, especially when he needed to slow things down and “let it simmer.”
Jackson is very aware that the lyrics, music, dancing, lighting and special effects have to be perfectly synchronized, or the effect will be lost. He is almost over-calculating in his choreography, often stating aloud what he intends to do in a sequence, down to the buttoning and unbuttoning of his jacket.
Anytime something wasn’t done according to Jackson’s taste, he was exceedingly polite about correcting the crew.
“It’s all in love. L-O-V-E. Love. We’ll get there. That’s why we have rehearsal,” Jackson said.
He would even go so far as to blame other’s mistakes on himself. As opposed to pointing fingers, he would say, “I’m having trouble adjusting.”
But once Jackson got the production to the level that he wanted, he enjoyed himself. He was visibly eager and excited. He always wanted to jump right into everything and just run it, over and over. Performing made him happy, and it showed. When everything went perfectly, sometimes he couldn’t help but smile in his final pose. Yet, he was as modest as he was flawless, always apologizing for not doing better what was already perfect.
“Well, that’s the feeling of it,” Jackson said.
There were a few surprises in the film. Jackson is actually quite funny. He makes jokes with the cast and crew, and even makes fun of himself. Most hilariously, he likens some of his dance moves to the pre-flight hand gestures of flight attendants.
Jackson is also a better actor than I anticipated. They created a video clip to transition into “Smooth Criminal.” Jackson plays a mobster-style criminal who shoots Tommy guns and crashes though windows. Uncannily, it works. And on stage, while being serenaded by a female singer, his emotions of shy affection look, oddly, genuine.
Another new addition to the stage were Jackson’s “Billie Jean” socks, which were designed to light up. Jackson went all out on the concert; from elaborate set pieces to fireworks, no expense was spared.
It is apparent that the filmmakers had limited footage to work with, which is truly a pity — especially to long-time Jackson fans who refuse to admit that this is it for MJ.
“This is the final curtain call,” Jackson said.
Hold for applause. Fade to black.
michael always wore white tape on his fingers when he performed.

The hot scandal in Hollywood right now is, unsurprisingly, a feud involving a certain Disney star we love to hate. Yes, Miley Cyrus is at it again, but she’s taken it up a notch: Instead of warring with Selena Gomez, she’s out to defeat Twitter, once and for all.
A few weeks ago, Cyrus made a YouTube video where she rapped (yes, rapped) about quitting the website. In the video, called “Good-bye Twitter,” Cyrus quipped that The reasons are simple/I started Tweeting ’bout pimples/I stopped living for moments and started living for people, and it had an unexpectedly self-aware style that I actually found a bit entertaining.
While Cyrus’s rap was more artistically forgivable than some of her music, not everyone forgave Cyrus for her decision to delete her Twitter. In fact, she has been forced to comment again on the situation after a crazy fan threatened to kill a kitten if Cyrus did not return.
Some people may see this as harmful — its guaranteed that PETA has already tracked down the IP address of the villain. As a self-proclaimed Internet nerd, however, I am thrilled: The web’s greatest meme is back, and this real life version is much more hilarious than the first — how could it not be?
You probably remember those pictures of the kitty being chased by two Domos through a field of grass. The image from 2002 had text at the bottom that read, “Every time you masturbate, God kills a kitten. Please, think of the kittens.” I’m sure you laughed when you saw the video, parodies of it and the sex club it inspired: Killing Kittens.
While you chuckled and emailed the risqué-yet-hilarious graphic to your friends, it probably didn’t cross your mind that someday, someone would play God and actually kill said kitten. And it wouldn’t be caused by your naughtiness, but by Cyrus not tweeting. Who knew?
The crazed Miley fan (@mileysavefuzzy) has started a single serving website, www.mileysavefuzzy.com, where he will keep us posted on Cyrus’ compliance, which as of now is none. Instead, the celebrity has sparked a huge debate on the network, commenting to news sources things like, “I think Twitter should be banned from the universe.”
Okay, Miley, I know you’re 16, but that is immature. We can’t ban things from the universe, don’t be ridiculous. Especially not Twitter, the networking service that has taken America, Iran and pretty much everywhere else by storm. The pop star admits that she loved it (she raps, I may have some withdrawals/I was a little obsessed), but vetoed any real hope of her return by stating she is “not a big fan of the Internet anymore.”
To this talk of quitting I still say, tough luck, Hannah Montana. The Internet needs you. Not only will your presence on Twitter save the life of a helpless kitten, but your absence will be the demise of bloggers and 4Chan nerds everywhere — whether or not you are aware of it, Cyrus herself may be the meme of our generation,” with “That’s so Miley” as the epitomal catchphrase.
Unfortunately for all us humane Twitter-lovers out there, the only person mean enough to fully capitalize on her existence is someone who’s idea of success is a dead cat.
The notion that anyone could quit the digital world and remain a functional human is ridiculous, even for a celebrity. Maybe Cyrus has forgotten what a role model she is, and that this statement could cause thousands of young girls to delete their social media accounts? She must realize the power her music has, and to realize that this the Internet is where the future is. The Internet is now a way of life, not just something you can brush out of your life. By encouraging her followers to put down their laptops, Cyrus is essentially making them defunct citizens.
With Cyrus shoving the web aside so nonchalantly, could she make hating the Internet the new punk rock? Will tweens be throwing their Ethernet cables around in the streets, wreaking havoc on the 30-somethings messing around on Facebook?
Hopefully Cyrus doesn’t start a movement, culminating with her army of prepubescents causing the next Y2K. And hopefully Cyrus realizes how addicted the lot of us were to her 140-characters of emo, or how addicted innocent kittens are to life.
