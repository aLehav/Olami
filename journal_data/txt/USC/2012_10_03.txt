President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney faced off during the first presidential debate at the University of Denver on Wednesday night.
Communication Professor Tom Hollihan, an expert in political debates, analyzed the candidates’ performances in the domestic policy debate.
 
Daily Trojan: Did voters learn anything new about the two candidates from the debate?
Tom Hollihan: I think what they saw was two different visions for how to take the country forward -— one vision that is much more focused on using government as a resource to help people and another vision that is much more reliant on free enterprise and individuals and states as opposed to the federal government.
What I don’t think they really learned was precisely what Mr. Romney will do. I think he stylistically did a beautiful job debating and I think he was very articulate at communicating his ideas. He seemed enthusiastic and prepared and ready to be there.
I think the one problem was he was unable to be real concrete and specific in terms of how he would achieve these things. I mean, at one point, he was forced to say my view of government is not that you go in with a proposal but that you listen and negotiate and talk to people and that’s what [he] did in Massachusetts. And I think in the days to come, that’s going to be the focus of a lot of the Democrats’ energy and attack –— to say, “He hasn’t really articulated what he’s going to do. He’s walking away from most of the specific commitments during the course of his campaign so far and he isn’t promising exactly what he’s going to do or how he’s going to do the proposals he wants to get to.”
 
DT: Do you think the audience picks up on that?
TH: [With] the immediate audience, it’s always a little bit unclear. What we know about debates is that the partisan voters are likely to go in and find enough reasons to support their own candidate’s position to confirm what they already had believed to be true. Undecideds often don’t even watch the debate so they are more influenced by the spin and the press coverage and conversation with their pals following the debate.
 
DT: Did the debate raise any new issues in the campaign?
TH: No, I don’t think there was much of anything new. It seemed to me that Obama tried to play the debate strategy very conservatively. He did not go on the attack. He really avoided issues like the Bain Capital or the exporting of jobs, he didn’t mention the 47 percent statement. He seemed to play a very conservative strategy. And Romney was much more in control of the emotional dimension of the debate, taking the attack directly to the president, being sharply critical of the president’s positions. I think that was the much more defining characteristic. I don’t think there was much substantively new in this contest.
 
DT: To what extent do you believe the debate will affect the public?
TH: What typically happens in these debates is that a challenger who can hold his own against an incumbent picks up at least some short-term gain in the polls. Whether or not that gain is maintained in days to come is really hard to determine. I think there is going to be some closing of the polls. I think Mr. Romney is going to see some advantage. But I think it will not be at all clear that he will hang on to that in days to come.
 
DT: What do you think the two candidates should work on going into the next two debates?
TH: I think they’re going to be trying to get Obama to show a little more energy, to be a little sharper and a little less long-winded. I think they’re going to try to get him to be a little more concrete in going after some specific things or flaws in Romney’s positions. I think [with] Romney, they’re going to try to say, “You gave as well as you got in this debate, but you didn’t make the final say. And you have to be more prepared about how to be concrete.”
The foreign policy debate, I think, will be an advantage to Obama. This debate was somewhat of an advantage for the challenger because Obama’s most difficult set of facts is the nature of the economy right now. But he’s been so effective with the foreign policy debate that I’d look for that to be an advantage for the president.
 
DT: Who do you think ultimately won the debate?
TH: I don’t ever answer that question in terms quite that stark.  … It’s a matter of which candidate better achieved the objective they have to achieve. And I would give the advantage to Romney on that. I think the fact is the Republicans will be enthusiastic about how well he performed in this debate, whereas Democrats will be more likely disappointed that the president didn’t deliver a knock-out blow.
 
DT: Were the candidates’ performances in line with expectations for tonight?
I think Romney outperformed what a lot of people expected. I think Obama was a little bit flat and underperformed. But I think his supporters may have been more optimistic because he is such an eloquent stump speaker. That doesn’t necessarily translate to great debating skills. Those are different kinds of speaking styles. But nonetheless I think people thought that would play into his debate performance.

Though the number of USC students with loans has decreased in recent years, a new study by the Pew Research Center found that about 19 percent of United States households — about 22.4 million — have student debt, a 4 percent rise since 2007 and the biggest three-year increase in 20 years.
According to the analysis, the economic downturn has made it increasingly difficult for recent graduates to find full-time jobs, causing the youngest and poorest 20 percent of households to become burdened with most of the nation’s student debt.
Kelly Chung, a sophomore majoring in biophysics, said it is difficult for young adults to worry about paying debt off in what is often the most exciting phase of their lives.
“On top of the primary expenses of living and tuition, people still want to live their lives and enjoy themselves,” Chung said. “They spend money on things they want and are not necessarily working all the time for more money. Just attempting to live a normal life as a college student is in itself one of the biggest obstacles to paying off loans.”
Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter, however, said that the number of USC students with student loans has slightly decreased. About half of undergraduates at USC are awarded federal loans and only about 36 percent of students are utilizing all of the loans offered to them, according to McWhorter.
“We’re trying to work with families to understand the value of an education and that student loans aren’t necessarily a bad thing,” he said. “But we do want students to borrow responsibly, and I think our students are.”
Catherine Keen, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, said she believes people are more willing to take on student debt because they feel that having a college degree will pay off in the future.
“A lot of people are struggling because of the economy. But for parents, giving their kids a good college education clearly is still a priority and something they aren’t willing to cut back on,” Keen said. “I don’t think there’s a cut-and-dry solution to the problem, but I do think that students should be careful about debt and the loans they take out.”
McWhorter said that the average student debt of graduating seniors at USC is $23,000, not including transfer students and parent or private loans they might have accumulated. The two-year cohort default rate was 1.3 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2009.
According to McWhorter, USC also awards students need-based grants each year. This year, the university awarded students $220 million in these grants.
“At USC, our cost of attendance requires that we have loans for students who have financial aid, but the university also provides a huge commitment,” McWhorter said. “The amount of loans — federal and state money — pales in comparison to the amount of university money that is being distributed.”
Some students said that loans often deter students from attending the school of their choice. Without receiving a full scholarship, Mushfiqur Chowdhury, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said he would be unable to attend the university.
“A priority for me going to college was definitely not taking loans and having to pay interest,” Chowdhury said. “College students are really lucky to be in that position because there are so many American kids who can’t afford college at all.”
Other students, however, emphasized the importance of student loans in making higher education more accessible to those who cannot afford it.
“[Student debt] is a problem because that’s the only way some students can go to college,” said Jacky Iniguez, a senior majoring in business administration. “At USC, you definitely see a huge disparity between students who have to take out loans to go here and students that can afford it. I know for me personally, I wouldn’t be able to go here without my loans.”
It’s only undergrad folks. The prestige/image of your graduate/professional school counts a lot more. It’s simple…don’t go to EXPENSIVE private schools for college. *cough*

The Post-Conviction Justice Project at the Gould School of Law announced Wednesday it would expand its outreach to include juvenile offenders sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The project, which started in 1981, aims to provide legal representation to deserving individuals while giving law students an opportunity to become skilled and ethical advocates, according to the Post-Conviction Justice Projects’ website.
The project initially represented women serving life sentences in prison, particularly those who have a history of intimate partner battering. On Wednesday, the program has decided to stretch its scope to include juvenile offenders sentenced to life in prison.
The PCJP agreed to represent 12 juveniles. Law professors Heidi Rummel and Michael Brennan, who co-direct the project, will supervise the 16 Gould students working on the cases, according to a statement.
According to law student Michael Hart, the project provides an opportunity to experience advocacy’s impact on the law.
“Our clients are so hopeful and doing the best they can to make their lives worthwhile,” Hart said in a statement. “Being a part of the Post-Conviction Justice Project has allowed me to make a difference in people’s lives.”
Rummel said the high potential for juveniles to change their behavior provided a good reason for taking on the new cases.
“We have taken on this issue because children are different than adults, and deserve to be treated differently in our criminal justice system,” Rummel said in a statement. “They are impulsive, vulnerable to peer pressure and often victims of their life circumstances. But most importantly, they have a much greater capacity to grow and change.”
The program’s new focus on juveniles comes on the heels of Gov. Jerry Brown’s approval of the Fair Sentencing for Youth Act, which allows juveniles sentenced to life without parole to petition to be re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole.
The bill applies to 300 juvenile offenders currently serving life terms without parole, but they will have to meet stringent criteria to be eligible for re-sentencing. Following re-sentencing, they are required to convince the parole board that they are suitable for parole.
The juveniles represented by the Gould students expressed hope about the new law.
“I was overwhelmed with joy when I heard that Gov. Brown signed the Fair Sentencing for Youth Act,” Elizabeth Lozano, an incarcerated 16-year-old said in the statement. “It gives me hope — for me and for future generations of children in California who will no longer be thrown away.”
Rummel echoed similar sentiments about the law’s potential to change the lives of these juveniles.
“It’s very difficult for juveniles to face a sentence to die in prison,” Rummel said. “The Fair Sentencing law gives them hope that they are not beyond redemption — if they work hard and rehabilitate, they might have a chance to go home.”
Though Gould is adding to its program’s scope, Brennan said the program plans to remain focused on its original goal of supporting women.
“We will continue to represent women who have a history of abuse and women serving life terms,” Brennan said. “But the opportunity to represent juveniles sentenced to life without parole is a relevant opportunity to expand our client base and practice in a developing area of the law.”

More students than ever turned out to view the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign and listen to the subsequent panel at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Wednesday night, according to Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
Analysis · Alan Arkatov (left), Aaron Taxy and Lindsey Kozberg discuss the pros and cons of each candidate’s performance at an event following Wednesday’s presidential debate. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The debate was held at the University of Denver and moderated by former PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer. Both President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney were eager to not only communicate their platforms, but to differentiate themselves. One of the central topics on which the candidates took different approaches was economic recovery.
Romney argued that, given the sluggish economic recovery, the middle class is worse off than it was four years ago.
“The people who are having the hard time right now are middle-income Americans,” Romney said. “Under the president’s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They’re just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I’ll call it the economy tax. It’s been crushing.”
Obama, however, argued that his policies — specifically a tax cut — have benefited the middle class.
“I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well,” Obama said in response to Romney. “And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.”
According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the debate, 67 percent of registered voters who watched the contest said Romney won and 25 percent said Obama won.
The panelists, however, were not so clearly swayed after the event.
“At the end of the day, the president did well. He was cool, he was the president, he responded well,” said Alan Arkatov, senior adviser to the manager of the 1992 Bill Clinton for President Campaign. “Romney has to be on the defensive now. Romney has had so many missteps in the past few months — if Obama had had half of those, he’d be behind.”
[Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Mickey Kantor was the senior adviser to the manager of the 1992 Bill Clinton for President Campaign; it also attributed part of the above quote to Kantor. Kantor was the manager of the 1992 Bill Clinton for President Campaign, and he was not present at the panel. The Daily Trojan regrets the error, and the quotation has been amended.]
Charles Epting, the public relations director for the USC College Republicans, said he believed Romney displayed a better debate performance.
“I think tonight, the more composed of the two was Mitt Romney,” Epting said. “I think that the Obama we saw four years ago is gone, and I think that Romney has filled that spot.”
Arkatov asked those in attendance at the panel to raise their hands if they thought Obama won, Romney won or if there was no clear winner. A slight majority of students appeared to raise their hands for Romney, but a larger number raised their hands when asked if they thought there was no clear winner of the debate.
“I think that the most important element of the debate tonight was how many mutual hands came up,” said Aaron Taxy, president of USC College Democrats. “[Obama] just kept it to the basic talking points because he knew that he’s ahead in the polls. I think he played it safe because he knows that on Nov. 6, he’ll come ahead in the polls.”
Though panelists and viewers might have had differing opinions on who won the debate, most agreed that they did not think that many undecided voters would be convinced to vote for either of the candidates.
“At the end of the day, there will be people who won’t be swayed,” said Lindsey Kozberg, vice president of external affairs at RAND Corporation and former special assistant to President George W. Bush in 2003. “I don’t really think there are a lot of people who are choosing at the moment between these two guys. I think there are a lot of undecideds who are choosing whether or not to vote at all.”
All agreed that the undecided voters are the most important demographic for the candidates to win over in the upcoming debates.
“I think that the debates collectively will be really important when it comes to early voting,” Kozberg said, referring to the fact that voting has begun in some states. “I think that overall the debates will have a really big impact.”
Part of this impact could come from young voters. Schnur, who moderated the panel, said the large turnout at the event disproves claims that younger voters are not interested in the election.
“You’ve probably read and you’ve probably heard from any number of media sources that young Americans are nowhere near as interested in the presidential elections as they were in 2008 — as you can see by the turnout here tonight, that does not seem to be the case,” Schnur said.
The Unruh Institute will host a live screening of the Vice Presidential Debate on Oct. 11 at 6 p.m. in Ronald Tutor Campus Center, Rm. 227.

Most coaches would prefer that their teams fly under the radar. The idea that their players are not getting the recognition they deserve creates an “us against the world” mentality that most teams thrive on.
At USC, this is most certainly not the case.
Arguably the premier sports team in Los Angeles, the Trojans have always thrived under the spotlight. Along with championships and Heisman Trophies, former head coach Pete Carroll brought with him a culture that was built on flash and swagger, evident by the throngs of celebrities, such as Will Ferrell and Snoop Dogg (or should I say, Snoop Lion), that graced the Coliseum sidelines.
USC coach Lane Kiffin, an assistant coach during Carroll’s tenure, admitted this past offseason that he is at least aware of the importance of being in the spotlight. In an ESPN article previewing USC, Kiffin confessed that “Winning solves a lot of problems. But not a distant second, I think, is style. It wasn’t our defense that has Snoop on the sidelines. It was the Heisman Trophies. It was the offense. Offense is what fills the stadium. That’s what L.A. is: Win, and win with style. And they’ll come.”
Aside from being on an apparent first-name basis with Snoop, Kiffin had a point. USC is not afraid of the hype or the attention; the program wants it. It welcomes it. And at the beginning of the year, the team got plenty of time in the spotlight. The season-opening victory over Hawai’i was broadcast nationally on FOX, and local L.A. fans packed the Coliseum to watch the high-flying offense rack up 49 points.
The following week’s game against Syracuse was also broadcast nationally, this time on ABC, and drew a 3.3 Nielsen rating, second-highest among college football games that weekend. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw six touchdowns in that game and was featured prominently on that night’s edition of College Football Final as the unanimous favorite to win the Heisman Trophy.
But all of that changed the following weekend. The Trojans got beaten up in Palo Alto, and once again the national audience was there to witness it. After the game, there was no Matt Barkley Heisman montage. In the days that followed, USC fell from No. 2 to No. 13 in the Associated Press poll, and the college football world shifted its attention elsewhere.
In USC’s next game against Cal, there were about 10,000 fewer fans in attendance at the Coliseum. The game was not even televised for all of Southern California, let alone the country. And to the best of my knowledge, Snoop was nowhere to be found on the sidelines.
It seems that the country has forgotten about USC, the team that was heralded by ESPN The Magazine at the season’s onset as the biggest threat to take the national championship away from the SEC. Losing a game, of course, diminishes such expectations.
But almost equally to blame has been the lack of style USC has played with. In its last two games against Stanford and Cal, the team averaged a mere 20.5 points and 384 yards per game, hardly lighting up the scoreboard. And with the team not playing last weekend, other teams took up airtime on nightly SportsCenter broadcasts.
Offensive juggernaut West Virginia’s quarterback Geno Smith has usurped Barkley as the Heisman frontrunner. In a recent poll, ESPN college football writers unanimously chose Smith as the leader, while Barkley plummeted to 11th on the list.
Or any number of SEC teams, four of which make up the top six teams ranked in the AP poll. Traditionally lauded for hard-nosed defenses, the conference has shown a penchant for high-scoring games lately, as in last week’s Georgia-Tennessee game, which the Bulldogs won 51-44. Top-ranked Alabama has also joined in on the offensive barrage, averaging 40.2 points per game this season.
And we can’t forget the sheer warp-speed quickness of conference foe Oregon, whose play and uniform selection oozes style and whose backfield boasts another Heisman favorite in De’Anthony Thomas — about as entertaining a player as you’ll watch this season.
Yes, there are plenty of other schools hogging the attention since the Trojans have been pushed off center stage. Even after the win over Cal, the team still only sits at No. 13 in the national rankings. But tonight, when the Trojans take on Utah in Salt Lake City, there are no other games on the schedule. The millions who crave midweek college football action have no choice but to tune in to watch USC as it tries to rediscover some of its swagger.
All eyes will be on Kiffin, Barkley and company, and the Trojans wouldn’t have it any other way.

Though football is the consummate team sport, there are certain individual matchups in each contest that are so lopsided they can significantly alter the game’s outcome.
Thursday night’s showdown between USC and Utah is no different, featuring a number of individual battles that seem to be an obvious advantage for one side.

Here are what appear to be four mismatches in tonight’s game that bear watching:
Holmes or Markowitz versus Lotulelei — edge: Utah
Senior center Khaled Holmes, a Rimington Award nominee, is an offensive captain and the anchor of the offensive line, but he might not be fully healthy after re-aggravating his ankle injury against California. If his bothersome ankle flares up, he will have little chance in slowing down Utah’s standout defensive tackle Star Lotulelei.
Before the season, CollegeFootballNews.com projected Lotulelei as the No. 1 pick in the 2013 NFL draft. At 6-foot-4 and 320 pounds, the senior from South Jordan, Utah has reinforced this praise, registering four tackles for a loss and two forced fumbles in 2012.
If Holmes is unable to play, senior Abe Markowitz will assume his spot. Though the former walk-on earned USC coach Lane Kiffin’s praise for his steady play at left guard against Cal, he would be making only his second career start and his first at center.
 
Dawson versus White — edge: USC
Before the season, this might have been a clear advantage for Utah. Entering the year, sophomore linebacker Lamar Dawson had only four career starts to his name, while Utah running back John White ran for 1,519 yards in his 2011 debut season. With former Oregon tailback LaMichael James now in the NFL, most expected White to take over James’ mantle as the Pac-12’s top running back.
But White is off to a slow start in 2012, averaging a mere 3.6 yards per carry. After sitting out of Utah’s Sept. 15 loss to BYU, White returned to action last Saturday against Arizona State and struggled mightily. Against the Sun Devils, he fumbled twice and ran for just 18 yards on 14 carries.
By contrast, after sitting out USC’s first two games because of a calf strain, Dawson appears ready to justify Kiffin’s decision to award him the hallowed No. 55 jersey, traditionally given to some of the best linebackers in USC history. Against Stanford and Cal, Dawson registered a combined 19 tackles.
 
USC’s second cornerback versus Christopher — edge: Utah
As Kiffin alluded to earlier this week, there’s no secret that offenses have so far avoided throwing into junior cornerback Nickell Robey’s coverage. As a result, it’s incumbent upon whoever emerges as the cornerback opposite Robey in this game to prepare for several passes coming his way.
Though the Trojans only surrendered 14 points to the Utes last season, wide receiver DeVonte Christopher, then a junior, racked up 136 receiving yards. Knowing Christopher represents the Utes’ greatest big-play threat, expect Utah coach Kyle Whittingham to do his best to call formations that will match him up against USC’s lesser cornerbacks.
 
Breslin versus Poutasi — edge: USC
Junior defensive end Morgan Breslin has been nothing short of a revelation through USC’s first four games. He is tied for fifth nationally with 9.5 tackles for a loss and is seventh with 5.5 sacks, even after not playing a game during the bye-week.
The junior college transfer from Diablo Valley College has officially become a player for whom opposing offensive coordinators must plan. Unfortunately for Utah, right tackle Jeremiah Poutasi is making only his third career start. Though Poutasi came out of Desert Pines High School as a relatively decorated recruit, earning recruiting attention from Oregon and Oregon State, he is still a freshman starting at a crucial position that is notoriously difficult to learn right away.

Nearly three weeks after an upset loss at Stanford Stadium, No. 13 USC squares off against Utah, which is  looking to make a statement after its own disappointing start.
Early retirement · Utah quarterback Jordan Wynn (above) retired in September because of recurring shoulder injuries. Wynn finished his career 14-7, throwing 33 touchdown passes — the sixth-most in school history. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Utes (2-2) have been decimated by injuries and lineup changes. Starting quarterback Jordan Wynn was forced to retire because of chronic shoulder injuries, leaving the job to senior Jon Hays. And senior running back John White, who ran for 1,519 yards in 2011, has just 233 yards this season and is averaging only 3.6 yards per carry.
USC coach Lane Kiffin expects White to be at full strength this week, and suspects he might look more like the All-Pac-12 performer he was a season ago.
“They’re just going through the growing pains of new guys in there and a running back [who’s] not healthy, so I’m sure they’ll be ready for us,” Kiffin said.
Picked to finish second in the Pac-12 South in the conference’s preseason media poll, the Utes carried high expectations coming into the season. But things haven’t worked out as planned, as they lost to rival Utah State for the first time in 12 games and lost to Arizona State by 30 points. Still, Kiffin believes the Utes, who are averaging just 23 points per game, are better than recent results indicate.
“We talk to our guys a lot about [how] previous games don’t matter,” Kiffin said. “They really don’t matter anywhere in college football. We’re always going to get everybody’s best shot.”
Coming off of a bye week, the game will provide USC senior quarterback Matt Barkley and the offense the chance to get back on track after a pair of subpar performances. In the loss to Stanford and the win against California, Barkley threw a combined four interceptions to just a single touchdown. The Trojans (3-1, 1-1) are averaging 33 points per game, down from 35.8 in 2011. Though they ran for 296 yards in a 27-9 win over Cal on Sept. 22, Barkley threw for just 192 yards, his second-lowest output of the season.
The Heisman Trophy hopeful has thrown 12 touchdown passes this season but has also tossed five interceptions, compared to just seven in the entire 2011 season. Even after a wild weekend in college football that saw West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith throw eight touchdowns in a 70-63 shootout win over Baylor, Barkley insists he isn’t concerned with his statistics — he just wants to win.
“I haven’t thought of any pressure up until this point this whole season,” Barkley said. “If we’re winning games by running the ball, then I’m fine with that. I’m not comparing myself to other people.”
Though the offense has been down in recent weeks, the defense has been playing its best football. The unit is giving up 17.2 points per game this season compared to 23.6 across 12 games in 2011. Junior cornerback Nickell Robey says he is excited about the opportunity to play a Utes team that has struggled offensively in recent weeks, especially with a backup quarterback behind center.
“When offense is struggling … just to know that we can put some fire on them, get some tips, some overthrows, some interceptions, we’ll be fine,” Robey said.
With the game on a Thursday, preparation has been different for the Trojans; they held rare Sunday and Monday practices this week. Despite the change in schedule, Robey said there really isn’t any difference in mindset for the Trojans come kickoff — they just need to play their game.
“We just know we can’t have distractions,” Robey said. “We have to limit the distractions and we just have to play USC football.”
 
Kickoff is set for 6 p.m. Thursday at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City. The game will be televised nationally on ESPN.

Indie pop favorite Matt and Kim is back on the scene with the same rowdy energy that catapulted it into indie heavyweight status back in 2006. The Brooklyn duo’s new album, Lightning, released Tuesday, offers a similar set of the propulsive synth and jovially defiant chants it is already so renowned for.
The first single off Lightning, “Let’s Go,” is filled with “ooohs” and Matt Johnson’s repetitive chants, “let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.” He is “shouting out of my windows/rolled down/‘cause I don’t care anymore.”
Though not quite the voice of a generation, Johnson knows how to rally the fist-pumping troops into buoyant synth-pop rebellion. With such a continuous energy present in its sound, consider it surprising the band didn’t have a song like ”Let’s Go” before this album.
From the street art-esque Brooklyn imagery of the album cover to the rah-rah songs powered by fun times and angst, Matt and Kim’s newest album doesn’t signify much change for the duo. Johnson’s nasally voice still sings fun, crowd-pumping melodies against crude synthesizers. And Schifino’s raucous drum accompaniments stuff enough beats in each track to make your head explode.
“Now” delivers such an in-your-face tempo you can’t help but dance, headbang or fist-pump — whichever might be your forte. Schifino shines on this track as her constant barrage of drums carries the song, colliding perfectly with Johnson’s chants of “Now!” Again, the troops rally in numbers.
“It’s Alright” continues the upbeat vibes, but also builds upon the vigor of the preceding song. The introductory synths, reminiscent of what you would here in a dance track, immediately transcend into a happy-go-lucky tune of “alright, it’s alright, it’s alright / you’ll see ooooh.” Here, everything is alright: a great high-energy song and easily one of the more outstanding tracks on the album.
Another noteworthy track, “Tonight,” holds the potential to be the anthem to your semester. Of course the content is, as you might have guessed, about “turning it up tonight.” Champagne is involved. As is something about New York. It’s a friendly tune to be expected at your next party, where sing-alongs might even commence.
But it’s not all fun and games for the indie pop duo.
Johnson adds an angsty attitude toward the album, a strange choice given the upbeat musings of Matt and Kim. As he wails out “You think I’m some little phony / thing is you don’t f-cking know me” over Schifino’s punk-inspired drum beat in “Much Too Late,” the message becomes most clear: the twosome can deliver a big ol’ middle finger to the world in only the cutest way possible, an achievement unique to  Matt and Kim.
But Lightning, while remaining in the band’s poppy spirit, fails to propel Matt and Kim away from their previous albums. Schifino’s contributions are stronger here, having grown more comfortable with contributing backing vocals, but many of these songs sound as though they’ve been heard elsewhere, perhaps even on previous releases from the band itself. Lightning falls back too much on the shouty singing, simplistic lyrics, rudimentary synths and melodic crooning that have already became quintessential characteristics of the band.
For longtime fans of the twosome, this album will make a great addition to the party playlist. And without a doubt, experiencing these songs live will be too fun for words. But Lightning simply holds little potential to attract new fans.

At this time of year, your summer glows are fading, the world is getting colder — like to 75 degrees — and the trees are letting go of their leaves and exposing their bare souls.
It’s October, and change is certainly in the air.
It’s OK to be afraid of this change. You’re at the point in the semester where all of your summertime hopes either begin to materialize or laugh at you.
For example, when you realize that you like someone, it’s easier to sit in the shadows and hope that they might notice you. It’s also easier to wait out your crush, waiting for it to dissipate. And it’s easier to hook up with other people, trying to erase the fact that your heart beats for someone else.
But then there comes a time when all things screech to a halt: When you wake up and realize that if only you could put yourself out there just a little bit, then perhaps your hopes would come true. You overanalyze every movement, every text. Your friends play into it, giving you the green light. You gain the courage and dive into the dark water.
And then you belly flop. Hard.
Yeah, those hopes and wishes of the other person saying “I like you, too” stand up and slap you in the face. Instead of gliding on cloud nine the next day, you sit on your bed with some cold chicken parmesan at 11 a.m. and watch Real Housewives (even though that’s a normal Saturday in my book).
It’s embarrassing at the least, heartbreaking at the most. Depending on how much you liked them, it could either feel like a bump in the road or the end of your world as you know it.
Most assume their sadness resides in the fact that the other didn’t reciprocate their feelings. Or perhaps you’re mourning the loss of a friendship.
Or maybe it’s something different. Maybe it’s the fact that you’re so angry and upset that the other person can’t see what’s right in front of them. Remember that one Grey’s Anatomy episode? Meredith stands in front of her McDreamy and tearfully says “Pick me, choose me, love me,” just before McDreamy does not choose her? Ouch.
Then there’s one of the many, many Taylor Swift songs dealing with heartbreak: “Have you ever thought maybe / you belong with me?”
In T-Swift’s magical, romantic world, a lot of the time it works out, with unicorns and glitter gliding you to your Romeo. But in the real non-unicorn-filled world, there’s only an awkward put-down of feelings and potentially an unfriending on Facebook.
Many people probably wish they had the courage to walk right up to their crush like Meredith.
Many people want the chance to just stand before them and say, “Hey, I want to hold your hand when I get scared at Disneyland. I want to sit with you on the couch and watch female-repelling car shows all night. I want to make you watch Real Housewives and hear you complain about it. I want to take you shopping because your taste in cargo shorts and mall stores filled with lung-cancer-inducing cologne is an abomination. I don’t care that you can be ridiculously annoying and obnoxious at times. I like you for you, why can’t you like me for me, and see that I could make you happy?”
Sadly, not a lot of people have that  kind of courage to begin with. But if you manage to follow through and have that one small exchange of word vomit, for a second there it might feel like everything’s okay.
And then it doesn’t work out and everything pretty much sucks. You probably won’t feel it on the first day, or even the second. But all of a sudden The Last Song comes on, you discover the band Of Monsters and Men and your roommate and their love start cuddling. You stand no chance.
Sorry to say it, but not much will make it better. Nothing your friends say, no matter how many times your mother tells you that you’re better than them and no amount of Oreos will make you stop feeling worthless.
The only thing you can really do is live your life and take it day by day, until the sight of the other person doesn’t make you want to vomit, cry or do both.
I mean, so what: You’re still a rock star, with your rock moves and everything. Just because the other person didn’t notice doesn’t mean that no one else will.
We all go through hardships. And those hardships only make the good moments even sweeter. So hold your head up high and be proud of your trials and tribulations. A good scar reminds you not only of a fall, but also of how well you healed afterward.
Maybe it’s time for a shopping trip. Or maybe it’s a chance for you to go out and meet more people on a part of campus where your crush doesn’t usually go. This could truly be a blessing in disguise — you just have to find out what you’re supposed to be looking for.
Heartbreak sucks. But it’s something that unites us all. If you’ve never gone through heartbreak, then you’re superhuman and I hate you.
I kid, but just know that others have gone through the same —and that others managed to pick themselves up and carry on the next day.
If life was always like a Taylor Swift song, then we wouldn’t have the beautiful, sorrowful sounds of Adele. If life were always rosy, then we wouldn’t be able to appreciate it, since it would just be “normal.”
Oscar Wilde once said, “The heart was made to be broken.” It definitely was. But it’s also there for you to put back together again.

With her latest novel, The Casual Vacancy, J.K. Rowling proves that there is more than one kind of magic.
Though hippogriffs, wands and talking snakes don’t make appearances in the book, Rowling enchants her readers with a sophisticated yet subtle narrative, where tragedy and heartbreak largely influence the lives of each of her characters.
Mature material · J.K. Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, now available at the USC bookstore, illustrates her departure from young adult fiction. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The Casual Vacancy begins with the sudden death of beloved citizen Barry Fairbrother — an event that ignites the entire novel. As the residents of Pagford reflect on Barry’s significance in their own lives, they immediately descend like carrion birds onto the empty council seat, each citizen believing that he is most capable of filling Barry’s rather large shoes.
You soon realize, however, that this is not just a novel about politics or arrogance. Instead, themes of heroism, adolescence and revenge quickly come into play, making The Casual Vacancy a reflection on the grim realities of life.
There are no Harry Potter-esque divisions of right and wrong here. If Harry and Voldemort are mortal enemies clearly standing on opposite sides of the good-versus-evil battle, the citizens of Pagford erase all possibilities of defining morality. Just when the reader prepares to pass judgment on a character, Rowling reveals an insightful backstory or allows the reader a glimpse into the individual’s most vulnerable thoughts, making her characters complex and unbelievably human — if difficult to categorize.
There is the hyper-sexual Krystal Weedon, who bullies and tortures her classmates but affectionately protects her younger brother, Robbie, from their heroin-addicted mother. There is also Stuart “Fats” Wall, a respected social insider obsessed with “authenticity” who is forced  to confront his somewhat questionable motivations.
With an array of characters ranging from victims of self-abuse to youth-obsessed housewives, Rowling proves that human nature is alternately flawed and admirable. In fact, the only person in the novel who seems consistently good is Barry — but then again, the reader is never privy to his thoughts.
That being said, however, The Casual Vacancy is not for the faint of heart. If anyone thought Rowling was too grounded in children’s fiction to handle darker themes, her latest novel puts those doubts to rest. Rowling’s characters intentionally ruin one another’s lives and remain wrapped up in their own selfish desires as they plod through their own miserable existences. Optimism exists in The Casual Vacancy, but it rarely appears.
Foul language, graphic depictions of violence and detailed sexual exploits are as commonplace as nouns in Rowling’s latest. Some critics have even condemned the novel for these mature elements. Rowling, they argue, should have remained mindful of her young adult fanbase before creating a book filled with such explicit content.
But truth be told, Rowling is more than capable of handling herself in this new territory. The Casual Vacancy might be a bit strong for those under the age of 18, but Rowling refrains from any sexual or violent excess found in the likes of 50 Shades of Grey or even A Clockwork Orange. Any descriptions of “miraculously unguarded vaginas” or lips swollen like “tangerine segments” exist only to provide insight into a character’s innermost thoughts and motivations. If anyone found Harry’s toned-down lust for Ginny Weasley in the Potter series unrealistic, they’ll find little to complain about here.
Most notable in The Casual Vacancy is Rowling’s ability to conjure up detailed images in the reader. A student sits “cocooned in concentration.” A demure nurse gazes out “at the abbey across the valley, stark and skeletal against the pale pink and gray sky.” A scorned lover feels “painfully alive to what she had risked in overthrowing her life for the man walking away into the night with another woman.”
Early Rowling fans might recall particularly well-crafted Harry Potter phrases like descriptions of Uncle Vernon “galumphing out of the living room,” but The Casual Vacancy shows a more mature author, one concerned with the finer details of English prose. Even if some might want to skim past the cringe-worthy passages on Simon Price’s violent exploits, Rowling’s incredibly elegant style refuses to be ignored.
If there is a flaw in the novel, it arises from an overabundance of characters. The first few chapters of The Casual Vacancy might seem a bit convoluted as Rowling unleashes a torrent of characters in order to capture every initial reaction to Barry’s death. Here, keeping up with character names feels impossible.
But Rowling seems aware of this. She always makes sure to refer to her characters by their full names at the beginning of each chapter — just in case the reader forgot the specifics of their involvement in the novel’s plot.
Though The Casual Vacancy represents a departure from  the magical fare of Harry Potter, the novel stands on its own as a solid piece of modern literature. With both grand dramatic turns and more subtle, nuanced emotional scenes, Rowling’s latest work stands as a satisfactory follow-up to her widely successful fantasy series. And though the book’s darker subject matter might alienate old Rowling fans, hopefully her newly channeled energies will also bring her new ones.
At any rate, Rowling proves she’s got the chops to tackle writing about the Muggle world as she embarks on the next chapter of her literary career.

The first week of October marks the beginning of Oktoberfest, so it’s time to pop open the beer, heat up the grill and try not to embrace a watered-down cliché of a good holiday.
The United States has an unfortunate habit of taking traditional holidays and turning their themes into excuses to get drunk on low-quality alcohol. Think Cinco de Mayo, which people incorrectly think is the day of Mexican independence and celebrate with sombreros and tequila shots. Or St. Patrick’s Day, where everyone’s suddenly Irish and poor souls decide to drink green beer.
So what to do about Oktoberfest, Bavaria’s 16-day-long celebration of beer? The festival ends soon, so whether you’re playing catch up for the missed days or want to try for a more authentic approach, try this out.
First, there’s the beer. Oktoberfest is, after all, a festival for beer. To celebrate properly, it’s best to avoid the lowest of the low. Cheap, watery and weak brews like Coors or Keystone are not suited for this kind of event. Instead, branch out and try something new.
Traditionally, marzen is the beer for Oktoberfest. It’s a specific style that adheres to German beer purity laws and has a unique flavor profile. It’s a lager, so it’s not too heavy, allowing room for food or another few steins. It also creates an interesting mix of malt with a hint of bitterness from the hops that doesn’t override the rest of the flavor. Essentially, it’s a well-rounded beer perfect for the start of autumn, whether you’re celebrating in Munich or Los Angeles. Chances are any Oktoberfest-labeled beer will be a marzen.
If you can’t wait, don’t give up: Just stick with German beers. The focus is on lagers and wheat beers. These are light enough to work with the rest of an Oktoberfest feast. The Weihenstephaner hefeweissbier is an amazing version of a hefewiezen, adding a sweet honey flavor to balance out the wheat taste. There is also a wide variety of German pilsners that are good for the task at hand.
If you prefer heavier, darker beers, there is an alternative: schwarzbier, or black lager. These brews weave the chocolate and roasted flavors more commonly found in stouts and porters with the body and strength of lagers. They’re crisp, not too light, and go well with richer foods.
Los Angeles is a multicultural urban sprawl, and there are places around the city that offer plenty of options to celebrate the festival. Würstkuche, located between West Los Angeles and Little Tokyo, offers a large selection of sausages and German brews and offers the best bet for a night out. Other great beer spots include SmithHouse at Santa Monica and Beverly Glen boulevards. It’s more of a traditional American grill, but it does have more than 150 beers available, including German brews — and the food is quite good.
As with any celebration, Oktoberfest’s food is appropriately decadent. That means lots of meats, hearty sides and more. Mostly, that meat is sausage, so prepare for lots of different kinds of wursts. Be generous with sauerkraut as a side when you load up your plate.
If you can’t go out, try cooking an Oktoberfest feast for friends. It does involve some labor, but the end result will be mounds of rich, tasty food. Try cooking up a pork roast or sizzling sausages on a grill. Boil some potatoes as a side, and be sure to have sauerkraut on hand to be a tart complement to it all.
Marzen is known for being sweet and malty, so the kind of food that complements it needs to be rich as well. When cooking, be sure to go heavy on spices. Vegetarian? Grill up a lot of fall and winter vegetables with herbs and olive oil and enjoy.
Celebrating Oktoberfest doesn’t mean putting on lederhosen and running around like a bad caricature. Nor does it mean using the holiday to drink the same low-quality drinks you would any other time of year, followed by late night fast food. Instead, try to add a bit of authenticity to your celebration. When done right, a good celebration becomes great.

It’s not as publicly debated a topic as the economy or healthcare, but the government’s policy on interrogating terror suspects deserves just as much attention from voters.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Currently, President Barack Obama mandates that interrogators stick to legal, army-approved tactics. According to an internal Romney campaign memo released this week, along with previous public statements made, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney aims to reverse Obama’s policy and go beyond these approved methods.
The next president must hold the country to a higher standard, and believe in interrogation that protects and promotes security in an ethical manner.
As shown by one of Obama’s first executive orders, the president favors a policy based on the Army Field Manual, an army-approved compilation of pertinent information and procedures that prohibits the use of torture for interrogation. This policy decision upholds the ideal that the United States, as a global leader, must hold itself to high ethical standards and cannot counter terrorism with more terror.
By comparison, Romney stated at a news conference in South Carolina last December  that, “We’ll use enhanced interrogation techniques which go beyond those that are in the military handbook right now.” “Enhanced interrogation techniques” is a term that past administrations have made synonymous with torture. Also, in a campaign document titled “Interrogation Techniques,” Romney states that it is acceptable, even necessary, to use stricter methods against captives from whom vital information can be gleaned. He also argues that by using techniques that are published in the Army Field Manual, which anyone can access online, interrogators lose the element of surprise, ultimately rendering the system less effective .
Furthermore, Romney said at the same South Carolina news conference that he does not consider waterboarding to be torture. This is incredibly dangerous for the United States’ international image as well as the less visible, but arguably more important, preservation of ethics and human rights. Obama’s choice to keep interrogation within certain pre-approved limits and definitions is what will maintain the country’s security and ideals.
Though the anger, even hatred, felt for terrorists is understandable, it is unacceptable to stoop to their level in order to obtain information. The impact of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States cannot be overemphasized. Not only did it result in changes in airport security and counter-terrorism innovations, it altered the way many Americans view the country’s treatment of terrorists. When tragedy strikes at home, it is easier to condone acts of violence that might once have seemed unthinkable.
One valid counterargument holds that even if cruel methods of punishment are condoned, the justification for any necessary use of torture must be very strong. It must be established without a doubt that first, a prisoner possesses the information sought, second, the information is absolutely necessary to obtain and third, the information will be useful in a timely manner. But even so, too many gray areas exist within these requirements. How can you be sure a tactic will guarantee information? Are there better, less cruel methods that can be used instead?
Torture is sometimes accepted as a wrong done for the greater good. Through national despair at previous terrorist attacks, Americans can gain minimal closure by knowing the government is doing everything in its power to prevent such events from occurring again. But an even greater good is the employment of decent methods of interrogation and the setting of an ethical standard that we hope other countries will follow. Obama’s torture policy promises to maintain that.
It’s easy to forget such unpleasant topics when they do not directly affect us. But on some level, torture is not only a reflection of the next president’s ideals, but of the level of morality each American retains. As voters, it is important to realize that a vote for either candidate is a vote for a certain system of ethics as well.

Not to make light of this issue (as it is incredibly serious), but for me, this issue will not be taken into consideration when I cast my vote. In no way do I condone the horrific acts that may go on, but there are just a plethora of other issues that need to come first with respect to who wins (none of which the candidates address maturely anyway). In short, this election needs to be more economically focused – the turn to debates on social issues is just avoiding the real issue and turning this election process into a sham of talking heads.

This summer, The New York Times’ “Room For Debate” blog, where non-journalists write brief pieces arguing their opinion on a topic, discussed the pros and cons of Teach For America, the renowned nonprofit that sends students fresh out of college into low-income schools to teach. Post titles ranged from “A Glorified Temp Agency,” to “Teach For America Changed My Life,” to “The Problem With Quick Fixes to Education.”
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
All of these are legitimate descriptions of Teach For America. There are many stereotypes about the organization, but none of them matter. Sending accomplished, smart and motivated young leaders into struggling schools is what matters.
Up until about a month ago, I would have added my own idea to the “Room For Debate” blog: “A Cop Out for Graduates With No Other Option.” I knew next to nothing about the organization, but had only heard of students who couldn’t get into law school or medical school or couldn’t find a job in their desired field, so they turned to Teach For America as a fallback. And as options go, it’s a pretty good one. Teach For America is a two-year program that promises a salary ranging from $25,500 to $51,000, health insurance, retirement benefits, up to $6,000 of no-interest loans or grants to help pay for relocation costs, plus scholarships and benefits from grad schools and employers. Why wouldn’t a college student with no other prospects apply?
But when a USC TFA recruiter emailed me at the beginning of the semester, asking to meet and talk about the program, I scoffed. I had no interest in being one of the college graduate cop-outs, but I figured I could meet with the recruiter to find out if there was more to the program.
I am now amid a rigorous, yet very interesting application process that proves what TFA is all about: finding motivated leaders who are unwaveringly committed to its cause. The process begins with a traditional application — statement of interest, explaining past professional and extracurricular activities and submitting your resume. One week later, you are either granted a phone interview or out of the running. In the meantime, you complete “online activity” that entails a timed multiple-choice test where you analyze data and complete a short answer portion. After that, you either move forward to a final, all-day interview or you’re out.
Even if a student chooses TFA as a fallback, if he or she gets through such a thorough application process and are selected, he or she deserves to be there. And even if it seems like a “glorified temp agency” that swoops up talented young people for two years then loses them to another career path, they were there for two whole years. More likely than not, they made a difference in many children’s lives and in turn, those children probably changed their life forever as well.
But this is yet another stereotype promoted by TFA — inspiring stories about college graduates helping disadvantaged students achieve the level of education they deserve. This stereotype has plenty of truth to it, but it ignores the darker side of the organization.
Though less-interested or less-qualified applicants are weeded out through the intensive application process, and those who are selected go through a five-week training program the summer before they begin teaching, nothing can fully prepare an applicant for standing up in a classroom in front of children who face some of the most challenging issues today. Horror stories about TFA teachers dealing with gangs in their neighborhood or struggling to teach students who refuse to respect them are left out of the TFA feel-good narrative. The organization’s website is full of education, poverty and admission statistics — but nowhere does it mention their retention rate.
For students interested in applying to TFA — for whatever reason — it is definitely important to be aware of what truth there is to all the stereotypes about the organization. The nation’s public schools and students, however, need help however they can get it. The myths and stereotypes don’t matter half as much as the fact that, at the end of the day, TFA offers that help.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish and is the Daily Trojan’s editorial director. Her column “Beyond the Classroom” runs Thursdays.
Teach For America really is a phenomenal opportunity for USC graduates, and Elena is accurate in her statement that TFA is looking for leaders, above all else. For Trojans who are interested in applying to the program, there is a book coming out soon that helps students prepare for the admissions process, both in gaining the leadership skills that Teach For America corps members exhibit, as well as helping applicants best craft their applications and prepare for the interviews. Check out the book at http://www.destinationteachforamerica.com for more information. Good luck!

The Denver Post published an interview with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Tuesday in which the candidate altered his stance on immigration, promising that if he is elected, he will maintain a program enacted by the Obama administration that prevents the deportation of young illegal immigrants.
While Romney might not be making one of the blatant mistakes he’s become known for this election season, the move holds little political value for his campaign — it won’t impact the Latino vote to any significant extent, and it could potentially alienate his more conservative supporters.
At first glance, supporting Obama’s program seems like a great move for Romney. He comes off as open-minded and sympathetic toward a demographic that has criticized him for being out-of-touch. Changing his stance could also be a sign of compromise in an extremely uncompromising election.
Upon further inspection, however, the decision seems to be almost entirely politically motivated. In light of the fact that Romney has had to put his foot in his mouth more than once while discussing immigration policy, his new position is more a political Band-Aid than a genuine effort to improve important immigration issues. It should also be noted that rather than adding anything to the debate on the immigration issue, Romney is simply taking one pre-existing program and promising not to cancel it. And he isn’t even referencing actual immigrants — since the program deals only with younger illegal “immigrants” — most of whom did not choose to come here, but were brought to the United States at a young age — this is far from an actual plan to tackle the problem of illegal immigration.
Though making such a politically — rather than ethically — motivated decision might seem harmless, Romney’s new stance could prove detrimental to his campaign and his complete plan for immigration, which he says will be implemented in his first term.
With relatively high Latino populations in swing states such as Colorado and Nevada, the Latino vote will be a major determining factor in the election. According to a poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, however, 69 percent of Latino voters support Obama as of last month. To change the minds of such an overwhelming majority would require much more effort on Romney’s part than agreeing once with Obama — such as creating his own policy and campaigning with it openly.
Obviously, Romney isn’t approaching the Latino voting bloc as effectively as he could be. According to a CNN poll taken last month, 44 percent of Latino voters consider the economy to be the most important issue facing the country today versus 14 percent who chose immigration. To appeal to a demographic that overwhelmingly supports Obama — who has been criticized for vague and ineffective economic policy — Romney should have focused on this rather than make a small compromise to his immigration policy.
His compromise will, however, be seriously taken into account by another demographic: staunch conservatives, who will interpret the move as weakness on Romney’s part. It also might offend those who strongly believe in rigid anti-immigration policy. This is a group of voters that Romney has locked down. Though it is unlikely conservatives will instead support Obama, Romney should be keeping them as close as possible.
Romney’s commitment to continue Obama’s immigration program is inconsistent with his previously harsh immigration policy, which could cause problems down the road if he is elected president. And Romney will have trouble following through on his other initiatives regarding immigration if he has to continue supporting a policy that isn’t consistent with his platform. To truly improve his numbers in the polls, Romney must focus on making concrete and effective policies rather than insignificant compromises.

Hey, He can win! This is good stuff!.
So, Romney finally won something, he fires big bird and Jim Lehrer, and tosses away all his previous core beliefs.
Well at least now he can say the poll numbers are his way, and his campaign will continue to adamantly defend the poll numbers.
But then the 7.8 percent unemployment rate came out and Romney and his campaign say its not “Sunrise in America”. like 7.4 Percent Was ‘Morning Again in America.
I was real surprise to see Romney say he was completely wrong about his 47 percent remarks, and it only took him three times.
I am waiting for Ann Romney to take back her “Latino biased against the GOP” and “You People” comments, but its too late for her and her husband.
The venom I saw GOP dish out during the immigration debate against those from Latin America and the sweet names they came up with like anchor baby(one of the least offensive), and they are surprise we remember. Not to mention the Voter ID in GOP controlled states have passd to reduce Obama votes (Gosh right before a tight presidential race they change the rules, please, we know whats going on).
Its funny seeing Romney trying to run down our country and say that 7.8 percent unemployment rate is not real or a good thing.
I guess we will find out in November who people believe.
This is good stuff!, I love it.

Sometimes — or perhaps all of the time — bad habits are difficult to break.
Smoking, drinking, drugs — but what about gluten? Yes, that gluten: The protein found mostly in wheat products.
Gluten-free people can indulge in moderation
One might assume that when you find out you need to go gluten free, it’s as easy to quit as that super hard G.E. Unfortunately, it’s hard to give up things that used to give you comfort, things that make you feel good, things that you ardently enjoy.
This past weekend I suffered a relapse. And not just “Oh, let me eat an Oreo or two.” I suffered the kind of relapse that gluten-free people have when they snap. Although being gluten free has helped my health in ways that I couldn’t even fathom, I still missed my McDonald’s, my pasta, my Oreos.
Too bad I don’t believe in the saying “moderation is key.”
Instead I had several plates of leftover pasta: cheese tortellini, penne primavera, chicken Parmesan. I had several pieces of garlic bread. I had several cups of Oreos sucked in milk (also known as goop), as well as McDonald’s after a night at the 9-0.
What’s that you ask? Did I feel guilty the next day? Negative, my body was in too much pain from the amount of glutenous junk food trying to decompose in my body. Safe to say, I’m not going to go down that road again for a long time.
So if you ever feel like you just can’t take it anymore — and it won’t kill you — then have that piece of bread. Have some cookies. Have a little bit of pasta. Just try not to go overboard.
Remember what life was like before going gluten-free? Probably tiring, with stomach aches and a genuine lack of health. You do not want to go back to being that person.
Everything in moderation, you guys. Unless it’s a 20-piece McNuggets from Mickey D’s. That you have my permission for.
I agree with the other posters. There really isn’t an option for those who must avoid gluten for health reasons to eat it in moderation. Each bite you take in is almost like taking in small bits of poison into your system and the villi in your intestine attack this gluten resulting in inflammation and a weakened immune system. 
If you’re going gluten-free due to gluten allergy, intolerance or celiac disease  I would suggest finding healthy gluten-free options for any foods you may be craving. Really, we’ve been following a gf diet for over ten years now and there’s not much we crave at all that we can make ourselves.
Who is this article intended for?  Because believe me, if you actually had a gluten problem, you wouldn’t think it was ok to eat it ‘in moderation’.  And for celiacs, it is absolutely not ok, EVER, to eat gluten.  Sure – I get sad occasionally when everyone else has pizza and I can’t eat it.  But to think that I’d take even a bite of something with gluten in it just because I felt sad for a moment?  To expose myself to weeks of headaches, stomach problems and skin rashes?  Why in the world would I want to do that?  
If you’re a fad dieter, move on if you can’t handle it – you’re indulging in self-denial because you like it.  If you actually have a gluten issue or, god forbid, celiac disease – then learn to deal with it.  You don’t need oreos to live.
I’m a little confused by this article and sincerely hope that you don’t have celiac disease or that newbies to the GF  diet who have it don’t read your article. Event the smallest amount of gluten can get them severely ill. For those with celiac disease, there is no such thing as moderation when it comes to gluten.

Last week’s Christian concert series, dubbed Launchfest, received a phenomenal wave of support on campus. According to the Daily Trojan, “More than 1,000 people RSVPed on the Facebook event and the crowd size at Tommy Trojan reached 400 people in midday heat.”
Yet, the lack of advertising for the religious mission meant some people undoubtedly showed up unprepared for Christian music. Neither the event’s title, nor its flyers, nor even its slogan—“New Music, New People”—suggested any Christian affiliation.
Launchfest featured exclusively Christian artists. While the concert organizers may not have wanted to alienate certain audiences with Christian advertising, to fail to publicize it as a religious event was deliberately misleading. Students who came expecting a secular show may have felt alienated—tricked even—leading to even greater alienation than publicity might have caused.
Honest advertising, meanwhile, would have enhanced the widely publicized “new music” theme, attracting more attention to the event—not less. For some in the audience, the Christian faith was indeed a “new” element to consider. If the connection between these two elements have been better emphasized, the intriguing message of venturing out the comfort zone would only have been strengthened.
It would also have changed the attitudes of people going into the series. Aware of the Christian affiliation, students would have come not just for a secular celebration of music appreciation, but also with hearts prepared to take in something beyond the music. More guests would have showed up ready to experience a new form of spirituality—or to reinforce a form they already followed—instead of feeling manipulated upon arrival.
Drawing attention to the religious undertones would ultimately have done more to accomplish Launchfest’s musician than selective publicity has. After all, the change of focus would have made it clear that Launchfest is not just about “new music.” Rather, it cultivates “new” fervor for faith through music.
Launchfest should have been presented as it was: a Christian event for not necessarily Christian people. Such a “new” conception of Christian music would have increased the event’s appeal, for Christian and non-Christian students alike.
We don’t want you on the row.
The idea of campus wide entertainment on campus off the row is great. We need more of it, especially at Tutor nights and weekends. Accurate promotion helpful.

Junior Nikola Vavic won his second Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week award in the last three weeks as he led the top ranked Trojans to the SoCal Tournament title this past weekend. His career high six goals against the sixth ranked University of California Santa Barbara Gauchos in the final sparked the Trojans to a 14-5 win and their ninth SoCal Tournament title in the last ten years.
Over the duration of the tournament, Vavic powered home 14 goals, defeating four ranked teams in the process. In addition to scoring twice in a non-conference game against Princeton before the tournament, he totaled 16 last weekend. The dangerous left-hander now ranks 14th all time on USC’s career goals scored list with 133.
He started off the tournament with four goals against No. 19 St. Francis in the opening game before scoring once against No. 18 Pacific. Vavic then scored a hat trick to lead the Trojans past No. 5 ranked UC Irvine in the semifinals.
Vavic did not let up in the final, putting up another hat trick before the Gauchos even got on the scoreboard. He continued his impressive display as he outscored UC Santa Barbara’s entire team over the course of the game.
The Player of the Week award has been given to a Trojan in three consecutive weeks, after Kostas Genidounias brought it home last week. A matchup against Pac-12 rival Stanford in Palo Alto looms this Saturday at 9 a.m. as the Trojans try to maintain their perfect record and No. 1 ranking.

It’s difficult to find an outfit that is comfortable for the sweltering heat outside and the freezing air-conditioning inside. Although it seems like there’s no way you can win, you can use this problem as an opportunity to explore a long maxi dress. This dress allows for ventilation to combat the scorching weather and coverage to feel cozy when enduring the air-conditioning.
There are two current trends to keep in mind when choosing the latest maxi dress.
The first option is the the tight black maxi dress. When this style of dress is accessorized with gold jewelry and a classic black and gold Marc Jacobs bag, an elegant yet comfortable look is achieved. This standard style of maxi dress is easy to find in most stores, but ASOS is a great place to start.
An alternative to the body-hugging style, which isn’t everyone’s scene, can be found in the flowing maxi dress which is cut high in the front and low in the back. This is a great choice for hot days because it enables an extra amount of ventilation. This style comes in a variety of fabrics and the store LF is a perfect place to find them.
How fast can they come off?
