After noticing that many protein supplements did not emphasize health benefits, two USC seniors wanted to create a product of their own. Harrison Valner and Ryan Roddy launched Kyoku, a workout supplement company which helps users looking to maintain energy levels. 
Valner, a senior in the Iovine and Young Academy, and Roddy, a senior majoring in business administration, met through Lavalab, a student-run incubator in the Marshall School of Business. They immediately became best friends and began carpooling to the gym they both frequented off campus. Realizing they both had a passion for fitness, they decided to create a business around it.
“We knew if we just created another protein powder or supplement or superfood shake that we would not be able to compete out there,” Valner said. “We had to do something that stood out that was different and unique.”  
They created their product to make sure that it would fit people with a wide variety of fitness goals. In an effort to expand their product’s concept, the duo sought out different grants for projects through the University. 
Kyoku works with dieticians and doctors to create personalized active nutrition plans for customers, and delivers shake supplements in single-serve packets monthly.
Valner and Roddy found that the Iovine and Young Academy provided grants for select student projects. However, the application was due the same night they discovered the opportunity.
“I had gotten … a reminder, I think it was that afternoon, it was like ‘Just a reminder, applications are due at 11:59 p.m.’ and I remember Ryan and I sat down for literally four hours straight and put together a business plan, built a deck and really built the entire idea of the company,” Valner said.
Once they received the grant, the pair spent their summer developing Kyoku and expanding their business model. Kyoku was able to raise nearly $100,000 after gathering funds from friends and family. 
“We soft-launched the business in early July and have spent the time since then in beta. We’re on track to hard-launch the business in early 2020,” Roddy said. “I think just getting ourselves to market and positioning our company sort of in a very fundamental way was the most pivotal thing to get the brand to market and set us up for success in the future.”
One of the company’s main investors is Science Inc., a consumer products-focused venture capital fund based in Santa Monica that focuses on pre-product companies. They were able to raise an additional $1.5 million with Science Inc. to be used for production and marketing.
Valner believes that what makes Kyoku different from other supplement companies is that they pride themselves in being comprehensive and detailed.
“If you’re going to the market, you’re buying a cup of protein, there’s just gonna be protein in that, whereas for us, our formulas range from 40-60% protein and 40-60% organic whole foods [such as] kale, spinach, beets, quinoa,” Valner said. “There are 25 different ingredients we work with.”
The company also emphasizes sustainable sourcing and uses sustainable packaging materials and ingredients. According to Kyoku’s website, the plant-based ingredients the company uses produce fewer greenhouse gases and all packaging is recyclable.
Sean Stevens, a senior majoring in business administration, is a customer of Kyoku and has known Roddy since freshman year.
“I’ve seen when it was just a flowering idea to kind of now their more rigorous day-to-day operations,” Stevens said. “I was definitely someone that saw that as something that they could change [protein supplements as we know it.] … I originally was using dairy-based protein powder and it would make my stomach upset and cause more breakouts with my acne. So Ryan explained the science behind and the pros and cons of the plant-based post-workout shake. And I was [like], ‘Yeah, you guys should do it!’”
For students who are interested in starting their own business, Roddy recommends that they have three important elements.
“A lot of people in the venture capital community, they really look for the product, the market and the team,” Roddy said. “Those are the three things that really are the determinant as to whether or not they’ll invest in a product or company. So I think it’s important to hit those three things in some fashion.” 
The duo said that having those three things, along with passion and a mission, will help people find success in their business. 
“Even if you have a great product, the market opportunity is there, and the team is awesome, [there are] going to be moments in the journey that are just too hard for you to keep on going on if money is your biggest motivator,” Roddy said. “There just needs to be something else that gets you up and motivated out of that, beyond external motivators.”

Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci spoke about President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, the impeachment hearings and the 2020 election nominees with Center for the Political Future Director Bob Shrum to an audience of nearly 150 people Tuesday at the Mudd Hall of Philosophy.
Scaramucci served as the director of White House communications for 11 days in July 2017 but was fired by Trump on recommendation from Chief of Staff John Kelly following the publication of a New Yorker interview in which Scaramucci used obscenities and defamatory language, referring to then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as a “paranoid schizophrenic.”
“That mistake was a fireable offense. Now having said that, I did contribute to getting [former White House Chief Strategist] Steve Bannon blown out of the White House,” Scaramucci said. “Even though I said something inappropriate, I do feel like I made a historical contribution to global sanity.”
Scaramucci has authored four books about politics and finance, including “Trump: The Blue Collar President,” an analysis of Trump’s campaign and presidency interspersed with tales from Scaramucci’s own experience working with the president.
Some members of the audience remarked that Scaramucci came across more personably than they imagined he would based on public appearances during his White House tenure.
“It’s interesting to see someone you’ve seen or viewed on the news and … how they come across differently once you get into this more personalized setting where they’re no longer obligated to do anything,” said Jared Stigter, a freshman majoring in computer science. “This is his real views, this is what he says and there’s no incentive to say anything otherwise.”
Throughout the event, Scaramucci referred to himself as a “blue-collar kid” several times, referencing his New York upbringing and Italian immigrant grandparents and describing the appeal of Trump’s campaign promises to the working class. He said he was particularly struck by an interaction he had with an attendee at a rally in Albuquerque, N.M.
“[The supporter said], ‘This guy is a business guy. We saw him on ‘The Apprentice.’ He’s telling me he’s going to bring the jobs back,’” Scaramucci said. “Don’t call these people deplorable and white nationalists. Go talk to them — they just want jobs, they want their families to do better.”
Scaramucci said one of the faults of 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign was her failure to campaign in swing states like Wisconsin, where she lost the popular vote.
“You’ve got to go to Wisconsin, you’ve got to go to Michigan, you’ve got to go meet with these people,” Scaramucci said. “Go do the work. Whatever your nominee is, go do the work and meet these people.”
Scaramucci also spoke on the impeachment hearings and called the contents of the impeachment report horrifying, saying he would support the president’s impeachment and removal from office.
“It is absolute rank criminality and rank lawlessness,” Scaramucci said. “If that’s what you want in a country that is at the 243-year experiment, that has lifted so many people out of poverty and created so much opportunity, we can go in that direction. This is a rank, criminal attack on the system by a very lawless person.”
Scaramucci predicted Trump would not survive the impeachment. He also gave his opinion on the candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
“I thought Kamala Harris was a very effective person, I’m surprised she flamed out. I don’t know that party as well as maybe some of the Democrats in this room,” Scaramucci said. “[Democratic nominee Elizabeth Warren] wants to revoke the system — I don’t know how that’s going to play. I think if she’s up against Trump … he’ll beat her brains in.”
Harrison Murphy, a sophomore majoring in political science, described himself as a moderate Democrat but said he respected Scaramucci’s views and the eloquence with which he expressed them. 
“I thought he was kind of the antithesis of Trump in the respect that he’s kind of a compulsive truth teller rather than a compulsive liar and I respect that a lot about him,” Murphy said. “His take on how 2020 Democrats need to understand that the American people don’t want to change the system, they just want it to work for them — I think that’s very true.”
At the end of the event, Scaramucci answered audience questions, including one about the future of the Republican Party. He likened Trump to the Wicked Witch of the West in “The Wizard of Oz” and said the rest of the administration could adapt to a different member of the party.
“[Republican Party leaders] have to get over their fear, and then he’ll melt away,” Scaramucci said. “Then they can rebuild and reframe their party, and they better open the tent … make it more available to people regardless of their sexual preferences, their religious experiences or whoever they are. If they don’t do that, then [Priebus] is going to be right, and I’m telling you right now, to me it’s a fatal killshot in the next six to 12 months for that party.”

USC Pharmacies, in conjunction with Student Health, is hosting the University’s first independent Drug Take Back Day Thursday to encourage students, faculty and staff to dispose of unused or expired prescription drugs.
The event will allow the community to dispose of these products at designated drug receptacles at each of the four USC Pharmacies locations. After the event ends, an authorized distributor will dispose of the collected medications.
The take back day is a step toward the pharmacy’s long-term goal of establishing permanent receptacles, allowing the USC community to dispose of unused medications throughout the year, said Raffi Svadjian, executive director of community pharmacies.
Svadjian said the take-back day will exercise a “no questions asked” policy and that all disposals will be anonymous.
“We wanted to create a safe place for our community of staff, faculty and students to return any unused drugs, any drugs that are expired,” Svadjian said. “We don’t look at the name of the medication, who returned it. We just ask that they place it into the container.”
Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said planning for the event began earlier this semester by recommendation from the Jed Foundation, an organization dedicated to mental health education and suicide prevention that USC has partnered with.
“As part of Jed, we actually do a comprehensive inventory of the program services policies on campus,” Van Orman said. “But, as we’ve been working over the last couple of weeks in particular with concerns around opioids on campus, it became really critical to get it out this semester and to do it.”
Van Orman said hosting a take-back day allows those in the community to safely dispose of prescription drugs, including antibiotics, analgesics and anxiolytics, and keeps those medications from entering illegal trade. 
“In some cases, either [prescription medication users] might voluntarily give [their medication] to somebody or it could also just be taken from them. Then that becomes part of the illegal drug supply,” Van Orman said. “These programs really started as a way to provide people with safe and secure ways to drop off their used prescription drugs to make sure that drugs were not being — we use the term ‘diverted’ — from the people that they were prescribed for.”
USC’s Drug Take Back Day is a local implementation of a nationwide push for wider availability of safe drug disposal, an initiative spearheaded by the Diversion Control Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration when it established National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in 2010.
Outside of take-back days, opportunities to safely dispose of drugs are limited, and improper disposal can lead to contamination of water sources, Van Orman said. Take-back day programs provide not only the convenience of an on-campus disposal location but also valuable education, raising awareness about the problems posed by unused prescription drugs.
The take-back day is particularly relevant to the USC community in light of recent student deaths, at least one of which Van Orman said may be linked to opioid overdose.
The University has promoted drug safety in  schoolwide emails over the past month, warning against recreational drug use and encouraging those in need of help to seek it via resources, including the new Department of Psychiatry practice, which opened on the fifth floor of the Engemann Student Health Center last month.
“I want to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to educate our students, especially about the real risks and dangers associated with substance abuse and drugs,” President Carol Folt told the Daily Trojan. “The mixing of opioids and prescription drugs with alcohol is an extremely dangerous combination.”

Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution to include the Student Assembly for Accessibility as one of its cultural assemblies during a Senate meeting Tuesday night. 
SAA advocates for issues of accessibility on campus and the diverse needs of disabled students. The cultural assembly consists of several organizations including Colleges Against Cancer, Kicks for Kids, Trojan Dance Marathon, Trojans for Neurodiversity and National Alliance on Mental Health.  
The inclusion of SAA allows the organization to receive the benefits of other USG-recognized assemblies under the programming branch, including increased funding from USG and greater visibility on campus. 
“Something like accessibility is a huge part of someone’s identity and it’s a huge part of their daily lives … I’m really hoping that the assembly will help advocate for that group and make them feel more welcome here at USC,” Sen. Christopher McMorran said. 
The programming branch currently includes five special interest committees that plan campus events and 10 community-focused assemblies that represent the interests of different student groups. Assemblies, such as Latinx Student Assembly, act as funding and advocacy umbrella organizations that unify individual member organizations. 
SAA will be incorporated as the 11th cultural assembly following a trial period from Jan. 13 to March 31. The resolution grants the assembly $6,000 from the administrative budget for its expenses. 
During his monthly Senate presentation, McMorran updated senators on his ongoing projects, including kickstarting a program at USC to provide subsidized U-Pass transit cards to students. The U-Pass program provides college students greater fare discounts on all Metro services in Los Angeles County, including Metro Rail, Metro Rapid and Express Buses. 
McMorran said he and Sen. Emily Donahue met with USC Transportation to discuss bringing the U-Pass program to USC and increasing the boundaries for free Lyft services. Since the meeting in November, McMorran has created a survey to gauge student interest in subsidized transportation to move forward with the project.
McMorran is also working with Residential Education to create a special interest floor for transfer students. McMorran believes the floor would help transfer students build a stronger community at USC. 
“Incoming transfer students would have a place they could go and share their experiences with other transfer students and have a place to call home because right now, a lot don’t,” McMorran said. 
Sen. Sara Khoshniyati also provided updates for her work with Residential Education to provide free menstrual products to students. She said they are currently deciding in which locations to pilot the program and how to restock the products. 
“It definitely is a project that is going to be on the ground soon,” Khoshniyati said. “We are looking forward to its launch.” 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article reported that Sens. Christopher McMorran and Emily Johnson had met with USC Transportation. McMorran and Sen. Emily Donahue met with USC Transportation to discuss the U-Pass program. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Robert Woods, Los Angeles Rams wide receiver
Woods has continued to play the best football of his professional career under Sean McVay in Los Angeles. He already has 64 receptions for 835 yards along with 12 carries and a rushing touchdown through 11 games. 
Woods’ high usage rate continued this week in Arizona, as he hauled in 13 receptions for 172 yards on a whopping 19 targets. Despite not catching a single touchdown pass so far this year, Woods is well on his way to his second consecutive 1,000-plus-yard-season with the Rams.
Clay Matthews, Los Angeles Rams linebacker
In his first season back in Los Angeles since 2008, the Trojan great has had an immediate impact despite fighting through a broken jaw he suffered in Week 5. In those first five games, Matthews had six sacks and was looking likely to continue racking up more. 
Despite missing five weeks with the jaw injury, Matthews has capitalized on his nine appearances, racking up eight sacks. Matthews and the Rams aim to end the Coliseum’s tenure as an NFL venue in successful fashion, while Matthews looks to finish out the first season of his two-year contract strong.
Sam Darnold, New York Jets quarterback
In what has been an eventful 2019 campaign for the Jets, the former Trojan quarterback has thrown 13 touchdowns in nine starts, adding two scores on the ground. Turnovers and consistency have been a problem for Darnold, as his 10 interceptions is tied for ninth-worst in the league despite missing three games. 
Darnold has been impressive in flashes this season, with two 300-yard passing performances under his belt. Ultimately, he has done a decent job adjusting to an entirely new offense and coaching staff in just his second season in the NFL, but he’ll certainly need to expect more from himself moving forward. 
Everson Griffen, Minnesota Vikings defensive end
In his 10th NFL season, Griffen has been a consistent pass-rushing and run-stopping force on the end for nearly a decade. This season has been no different, as he currently has seven sacks, three tackles for a loss and an interception, consistently wreaking havoc on the defensive side of the ball. From Weeks 7 to 11, Griffen racked up four sacks over five games in a particularly dominant stretch. Griffen and the Vikings look to secure a playoff spot in the final weeks of the season. 
Ronald Jones II, Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back
The 2018 second round pick is enjoying quite the sophomore season in Tampa Bay under new head coach Bruce Arians. Jones is threatening 1,000 all-purpose yards from scrimmage and has scored five touchdowns this season. 
After Week 8, Jones was formally announced as the Bucs’ starting running back, following weeks of competing for the role. His success comes as a refreshing surprise after a disappointing rookie season. The Bucs will only face one team with a winning record in their remaining games, so Jones has the opportunity to put up more 100-plus-yard performances.

I first watched the movie “Miracle” in middle school when I was 13 years old. Before seeing the film, I did not know much about hockey or the fact that it was a major sport. But after, I realized just how significant hockey was to some people.
The 1980 U.S. hockey team entered the Winter Olympics as the youngest team in the field, consisting of mostly amateur players. Nonetheless, the team advanced to the semifinals, knocked off the perennial powerhouse Soviet Union 4-3 in what has been dubbed the “Miracle on Ice” and eventually went on to win the gold. It’s one of the most famous teams in American sports history.
In a country where football, basketball and baseball dominate, hockey is still a part of the “major sports” group. However, out of those, hockey is the sport that people pay the least attention to.
Currently, the National Hockey League consists of 31 teams — 24 are in the United States and seven are in Canada. The most recent team to join the NHL was the Vegas Golden Knights, who joined the league in 2017. The NHL will even be welcoming its 32nd team to Seattle in 2021.
This is a good sign for the premiere ice hockey league in the world. Before the Golden Knights, the last time the NHL expanded was in 2000. The NHL adding two teams in five years is definitely a sign that the league is trying to grow its fan base.
One of the major reasons the NHL and hockey itself have not grown to the likes of the NFL and football is that hockey is much harder to get involved in. Interested players need an ice rink facility to practice and play games, the cost of equipment is high and there is a lack of recreational teams that people can get involved with.
Even though there are a lot of restrictions when it comes to hockey, there is good news. According to usahockey.com, the number of hockey players in the 2018-2019 year is 567,908 — an all-time high. 
Viewership for the NHL has increased recently as well. According to NBC Sports, Game 1 of the 2019 Stanley Cup Final between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues was the most-watched Stanley Cup game in four years, with over 5 million viewers.
People are starting to recognize and appreciate hockey more. Hockey players are some of the most hardworking and dedicated athletes, and they play one of the most physical sports in the world.
As for myself, I never grew up with hockey or had friends who played. Even though I’m from Seattle, which is known for colder weather and its proximity to Canada, there were not many recreational leagues for kids my age growing up. 
I am actually pretty excited to welcome an NHL team to Seattle, though, because there are many NHL fans there who have been waiting for that moment. As a result, I hope to get into hockey as well and devote more time to watching the sport.
Hockey is a great sport and it is only a matter of time before it gets more exposure. Hopefully, major networks such as ESPN and NBC will show more regular season NHL games in order to increase viewership and fan engagement. 
Hockey is exciting, and I’m sure it’s a great sport to play. I understand that parents may not want their children to get involved with hockey because injuries are far more likely to happen than in less violent sports, but if those same parents get their children involved with football, I do not see much difference. 
Even though it may be hard to get involved in hockey or attend an NHL game, it is easy to watch a hockey game on TV. It may be hard to understand the rules at first, but it only takes a little persistence to learn how the game is played and why the sport can be so fascinating. Give it a chance — maybe, just maybe, the game of hockey will surprise some people.

College football championship weekend is just two days away. Though USC won’t be taking the field in Santa Clara this year for a chance at a Pac-12 title — CFP No. 5 Utah and No. 13 Oregon will — this weekend’s games all across the country could have plenty of implications for the Trojans’ bowl game fate. Though only two are realistic, USC still technically has three possible bowl game destinations. 
ROSE BOWL — Jan. 1, Pasadena
Let’s get this out of the way quickly because it won’t happen, but yes, USC could still theoretically wind up in Pasadena. It would take an utter thrashing of Oregon by the Utes in the Pac-12 Championship Game coupled with a ridiculous decision by the College Football Playoff committee to rank three-loss Oregon, who demolished four-loss USC by 32 points in Week 10, behind the Trojans. 
Should this all happen — it won’t — the Tournament of Roses could select USC to represent the Pac-12 in the Rose Bowl. It won’t happen. Next. 
ALAMO BOWL — Dec. 31, San Antonio, Texas
If Utah takes down Oregon, the Utes could find themselves in the College Football Playoff. This would likely require an SEC Championship win by No. 2 LSU over No. 4 Georgia — which is possible and likely — to open up a spot for a team beyond LSU, No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 Clemson. If Utah goes to the playoff, Oregon would likely play in the Rose Bowl and USC would wind up in the next-highest bowl game for the Pac-12, the Alamo Bowl. 
If Oregon defeats Utah in Santa Clara, Oregon would still have no shot at the playoff, so it would go to the Rose Bowl. Should that happen, Utah could be selected as one of the at-large teams in the Cotton Bowl — it would have a valid case as a two-loss team whose two defeats came to ranked opponents. If that happens, USC goes to the Alamo Bowl, again, the next-highest bowl game in the Pac-12 pecking order. 
An unlikely scenario: Utah takes down Oregon but misses the playoff — likely by virtue of a Georgia win over LSU, which would probably keep both SEC teams in the Top 4. If Georgia wins and neither Ohio State nor Clemson suffer massive upset losses in their respective conference championships, Utah is left out and goes to the Rose Bowl. Utah could also miss out if No. 6 Oklahoma destroys No. 7 Baylor — or even the other way around — and the Utes barely beat the Ducks.
The Ducks could, in theory, be chosen for the Cotton Bowl — though that seems improbable, given they would be a three-loss team with a bad defeat to Arizona State. But, if it does happen, USC would go to the Alamo Bowl. 
HOLIDAY BOWL — Dec. 27, San Diego
If Utah wins the Pac-12 Championship and misses the playoff, it would go to the Rose Bowl. Assuming Oregon does not become one of the at-large teams selected for the Cotton Bowl, it would go to the Alamo Bowl. USC would then drop to the next-best bowl game for the Pac-12: the Holiday Bowl. Again, this would probably require wins from Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia — the first two of which feel likely, the last one less so. 
Finally, if Oregon emerges victorious at Levi’s Stadium this weekend, it would be locked into the Rose Bowl — again, it has zero shot at the playoff, and a Pac-12 champion that misses the playoff goes to the Rose Bowl. Utah, if not selected to the Cotton Bowl, would then go to the Alamo Bowl, slotting USC into the Holiday Bowl.

For decades, sports has centered on the notion that the longer you practice and the harder you train, the better you’ll play. In recent years, that appears to have changed.
“It used to be about being stronger, being faster, being in the weight room, getting in as much time as you can performing and training and [practicing],” said Anthony Kjenstad, founder and president of Athletic Recovery and Performance. “Now, there is probably as much of a push to make sure you are recovering as well as you can so that you perform optimally.” 
Traditional electrical muscle stimulation devices were used at schools across the country to help college athletes recover after games and practices. These devices were often large and bulky and required athletes to slip cumbersome boots on their legs to reap the benefits of the treatment. 
But innovation is on the rise as this idea of improving sports recovery surfaces. According to Russ Romano, head athletic trainer at USC, the firefly, a device exclusively distributed by Athletic Recovery and Performance, is beginning to change the sports recovery landscape.
“You can be hooked up to recovery boots,” Romano said. “Those exist, but you’ve got to plug those into an electrical outlet, or they’re battery-operated and you have to wear these bulky boots … but [with] fireflies, I can carry 50 pairs of fireflies in a Ziploc bag. I can’t carry 50 pairs of boots.” 
The firefly is an electric sports recovery device that stimulates the common peroneal nerve on the knee to elicit a muscle contraction in the calf that stimulates blood flow. It comprises a small adhesive strip that wraps around the knee and sends a small, painless electrical stimulus to the nerve. 
“You will get two things out of it,” Kjenstad said. “If you’re running blood to your heart faster, you’re going to get more oxygenation in your blood … so that’s going to help you with overall performance recovery by reoxygenating your blood and running it through your system faster. The other component you’re going to get from the firefly is an increase in lower extremity microcirculation by 400%.” 
The firefly has entered USC at a time when there is growing concern regarding young athletes injuring themselves so early on in their career. The issue has already started to affect USC, as prominent athletes such as football sophomore quarterback JT Daniels and soccer junior midfielder Savannah DeMelo — among others — have suffered injuries that threaten not only their health this season but possibly their future careers as well. 
Kjenstad said that increase in microcirculation translates to a feeling of fresher legs after working out by reducing delayed onset muscle syndrome — soreness caused by muscle inflammation shortly after working out. 
In layman’s terms, the firefly increases blood flow in the lower body to help athletes recover faster from workouts, practices and games. 
The device came to Romano’s attention when a former knee brace representative introduced him to the product. Before then, the technology had been used in British hospitals to prevent blood clots. It has only recently been re-engineered into a sports recovery product. 
Romano confesses that at first, he just saw the firefly as one of the many recovery devices that he has been pitched over the years. 
“I get pitched [new technology] all the time,” he said. 
Still, the research supporting the firefly was convincing, so Romano and his team decided to give the device a try. 
With the help of a team physician, Romano used a diagnostic ultrasound machine to examine a blood vessel in his knee. While wearing the firefly, Romano and the physician monitored the vessel as the device was turned on and off. 
“We were able to demonstrate that not too much was happening — normal blood flow was going on with the device off,” Romano said. “When I turned the device on, [I] saw a big effect [on] blood flow.” 
When the device was turned off, Romano’s blood flow quickly returned to its previous state. 
“[The research papers] definitely validated the product as a device to increase blood flow,” Romano said. “But from a recovery standpoint, [the diagnostic ultrasound] really validated it for me in addition to those other papers [because] I saw it first hand.” 
After determining the firefly’s efficacy, Romano and USC gradually introduced it to the University’s athletes. 
“USC was a very early adopter,” Kjenstad recalled. “It’s only grown with USC. Again, they’re probably one of the few schools that uses it across all of their sports — not [only] what I would call the money sports like football and basketball.” 
According to Kjenstad and Romano, USC’s football, basketball, soccer, rugby, lacrosse and rowing teams have all used the product. Due to concerns regarding potential NCAA violations, players on the teams could not be contacted for fear of their being perceived to endorse a product.
Still, Romano was able to provide some insight into how the product has been received amongst Trojans. 
“I’ve had some players come to me and say, ‘Yeah, these were great, I wasn’t as sore as I usually would expect to be after a game like this,’” Romano said. “One [football] player told me that he usually would have muscle cramps every time [we traveled] … This person had cramped throughout their career, and the firefly eliminated that.” 
When asked whether or not USC plans to continue using the product, Romano was quick to respond. 
“Yes,” Romano said. “I’m really pleased with it. I think there’s a direct benefit, otherwise we wouldn’t use them.” 
Beyond continued use among USC’s athletic teams, Romano says the USC intends to study the broader implications the device might have on the field of sports recovery. 
“We’re looking at it to see where it can benefit post-injury,” Romano said. “We’re looking at it to see the effects of increasing blood-flow — what’s in the blood that’s beneficial to the body … Those are the things we don’t fully understand but we’re trying to get a better picture of it.” 
Despite the positive reception of the firefly thus far, Romano stresses that there is still much more to athletic recovery. 
“It’s an adjunct to all the things that assist in recovery,” Romano said. “Getting ample sleep is really important. Post-game nutrition and hydration are extremely important in the recovery process. The fireflies play a role in that but you have to do a combination of things to be successful.”

College is a place of undeniable learning — a hub of talented minds exploring their potential before entering the cruel, harsh world. It’s a place of education, esteemed education, where professors are selected and students are chosen, a cultivated environment of instruction that is designed to perfect the unpolished minds of high school students and fledgling undergrads. 
When I entered college, I expected to learn — and I did. I’ve earned my degree after four years of toil and labor. But more importantly, and at risk of being cliche, the most important education I received occurred outside of a classroom.
I learned how to eat.
And I learned how to grieve. 
And I learned that, at least for me, eating was grieving.
In college, eating became an important ritual for me. Mealtimes were unstructured, chaotic and often lonely. Eating with friends, and by proxy, eating in restaurants, became one of my only valued social activities. Food was an act of self-care, or self harm, an engagement with one of the most base human necessities in stressful times. 
“Are you eating?”
I learned to appreciate restaurants more than ever — how ingredients were gathered, how the menu was assembled, how the dishes were presented. Being independent meant also deciding which meals were worth spending money on, so I had a deeper appreciation of a chef’s work. Over the four years, I became more analytical about the food I was eating — its societal impact, its message, its authenticity to a particular culture or cuisine. 
But more than anything else, I learned about the emotional weight of food.
“Are you eating well?”
Along with many other young adults, college was my first honest experience with grief. I lost friends. I lost family. I severed friendships and made decisions that I also grieved over, in a milder way.
In grief, food becomes power. 
Sometimes, it is shunned, a creature of comfort selectively avoided as a result of tremendous pain. Eating becomes a chore, something meant to be enjoyed when life feels anything but joyous. Sometimes, food is embraced — a celebration of life, of yours and those who have left you. It can be a righteous stance against the incoming waves of sadness; in a moment of rebellion, you feed yourself.
“Are you eating?”
We are human, and we eat.
When I grieve, I can’t register my own emotions. Life glides by, glossy and unprovoked, and I am a spectator in my own story. 
I cry, but I don’t understand what triggered it. I laugh, and it feels like canned laughter in a sitcom, overblown and disingenuous. One of the only ways I can mark my well-being is what I eat and how I eat it.
Food is a remarkable litmus test for emotional status: “Are you eating? Are you eating well?”
In high school, after an acquaintance had died by suicide, I restricted my food. I counted every calorie. I subsisted on a diet of egg whites and baby carrots. And I continued to live, blissfully unaware of the emotional pain I was trying to control through my food.
In college, I binge ate. 
Sometimes it would be unassuming — shredded cheese out of the bag at 2 a.m., or an extra large batch of pancakes after a rough night. Other times, it was uncontrollable — after my friend was murdered, I only ate turkey burgers for a week, after months of being vegetarian. 
“Are you eating well?”
This is my last semester at USC. It has also been a particularly tumultuous semester at USC; nine students have passed away. Sometimes, I find myself crying. Sometimes, I realize I haven’t eaten all day. I realize, through what I eat, and how I eat it, that I am grieving.
But I’ve had all four years to learn that about myself. So my question to the rest of the student body is:
Are you eating? Are you eating well?

Perseverance is the first word that comes to mind when hearing the story of Ali Stroker. 
The Tony Award-winning actress serenaded the Bing Theatre audience Monday with three songs and shared her journey from a dream-filled child to playing Ado Annie in Broadway’s adaptation of “Oklahoma!” 
Hosted by Visions and Voices, the program, “Turning Limitations into Opportunities,” showcased Stroker’s endurance through a string of hurdles due to a disability she has lived with nearly her entire life. She was hurt in a car accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down.
While the injury limited Stroker’s ability to have similar physical capabilities as her peers, she found that musical theater allowed her a different kind of movement that proved just as powerful.
“I also learned that with my voice, with my singing, I could run. I could jump. I could play like all the kids my age. Except I did it with my voice. And that changed everything,” Stroker said. “I had a new identity. I was no longer just Ali Stroker, the girl on the wheelchair. But I was Ali Stroker, the singer, the actress and soon to be dancer.”
Yet, she soon realized that the path to Broadway star was a lot more complicated being in a wheelchair. When Stroker attended the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in 2005, for example, she had to adapt the courses to her needs without the help of others.
“I was met with people who didn’t understand. They didn’t know how to teach me. And this was going to be the greatest challenge and the greatest gift that I got from college,” Stroker said. “Because I realized that I was going to have to do some educating. ’Cause I was the expert after all. There were no teachers in chairs. There were no other students in chairs.”
However, after graduating in 2009 and pursuing different projects, including “The Glee Project,” Deaf West’s production of “Spring Awakening,” and most recently “Oklahoma!,” Stroker finally saw the payoff from years of working, perfecting and believing with her Tony win this past June.
“I thought a little about what I was going to say, and I was reminded that week of watching the Tonys for so many years and being that dreamer,” Stroker said. “Dreaming of being up there. And I said what I said that night, because I had never felt like I had dreamt of someone like me winning or seeing someone like me on stage … That is why I dedicated the award to all kids watching who have a disability, who have a limitation, who have a challenge.”
The audience’s reactions to the event were strongly positive. Many attendees expressed the immense impact Stroker has had on their personal struggles with disabilities during the Q&A section and after the show. 
“Someone asked a question about dealing with invisible illnesses, which is something I have, and I really liked how she talked about, not only about self-advocacy, but also about saying what you need and saying thank you afterwards,” said Sara Zuluaga-Sierra, a sophomore studying NGOs and social change.
Also present in the audience were some of Stroker’s friends who have seen parts of her journey to the Broadway stage. Chelsie Hill, a friend of Stroker since 2012, talked about the influence Stroker has had on her own personal history with a disability.
“I think the biggest thing Ali has ever taught me when I was first injured was turning your limitations into opportunities, and it’s so cool to see her eight years later still saying the same thing and with all the achievements she’s done,” Hill said. 
To all aspiring performers with disabilities, Stroker instilled these words: “I’m the first, but you can be the second and the third. So there are no more excuses. You belong here now, so come on. We need you.”

“Queen and Slim” opens with a Tinder date in a local diner, Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) and Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) discussing photographs. 
Slim doesn’t like taking photos of himself. He knows what he looks like. But Queen believes that pictures are something deeper, proof of one’s existence. Slim isn’t having it. “My mother and father know I’m here. That’s enough,” he responds. This is the central thematic thread of the “Queen and Slim” legacy, whether it be immortalization by celluloid or memories embedded in the minds of family.
On the way back from their date, Queen and Slim are pulled over by a police officer. The situation escalates, eventually, Slim kills the officer in self-defense, launching the rest of the movie — a “Bonnie and Clyde”-esque chase across the country as the couple attempts to escape to Cuba, bumping into strange characters along the way.
The strongest part of the film is undeniably Melina Matsoukas’ directing. Previously known for her work on Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” she shows off a remarkable set of techniques, especially for a first-time feature film director. 
Much of the film features the couple driving through America, and Matsoukas chooses to film most of this from the outside of the car — many of the shots are of Queen or Slim looking out through the window. Seeing the characters through a pane of glass is reminiscent of a museum or picture frame, again playing on this idea of legacy. Queen and Slim are being immortalized, both through the media sensationalizing their journey across the country in the film, and through metatextuality by the film itself. 
Matsoukas also works well with cinematographer Tat Radcliffe to craft some beautiful images. There is a lot of cool turquoise and deep blues, as well as an overt interest in black features. There are multiple instances of presenting dialogue as voiceover while the camera observes Queen or Slim, content in capturing their quiet emotionality instead of the actual machinations of their speech. 
Kaluuya as Slim and Turner-Smith as Queen both give good performances throughout the film, however they don’t do well together. Especially in the beginning, they lack the chemistry to properly sell their relationship, causing the film to drag in the first half. This could partly be attributed to some of the dialogue — in fact, the script, written by Lena Waithe, seems to be the film’s biggest flaw.
Waithe attempts to weave social commentary throughout the narrative, playing on imagery familiar to the viewers from media coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most of it is quite clumsy, trying to be provocative but too self-conscious to offer up any new or interesting ideas.
One sequence in particular — a protest-turned-riot in support of Queen and Slim which is intercut with them having sex for the first time — is comedic in how completely it fumbles the theme Waithe sets up. There are also a few scenes that creep up on “Atlanta”-esque surrealism but don’t stick the landing and just come across as awkward.
However, the ending is beautiful. Queen and Slim make a final stand on an airport runway — cops on one side, a plane on the other — escape within reach. Everything comes together — their immortalization, their struggle, their lives, their death. 
We don’t end lingering on the fate of Queen and Slim. Instead, we see a picture they took earlier in the film becoming a symbol of their struggle and something bigger than them, a rallying point for change. It is, in effect, their legacy.

With finals quickly approaching, it’s safe to say that just about every student on campus is dreading the same thing: those sleepless nights spent in Leavey Library, cramming for what feels like an endless week of exams. However, research has shown that putting in long hours is not always the most efficient way to study. Instead, here are a few methods to study smarter and make finals week less overwhelming.
First, let’s talk about ways to get the most out of our limited study time. 
Although it may seem counterintuitive, taking breaks is actually crucial to effective time management and long-term retention. According to the interference theory popularized by psychologist Benton Underwood, studying for long, uninterrupted periods results in proactive interference — in other words, previously studied information will inhibit the learning and retrieval of new material later on. 
To prevent this psychological effect from hindering your studying, it’s important to take breaks with activities unrelated to the topic you’re learning. These kinds of breaks allow for release from proactive interference, meaning you’ll be able to return to studying with a refreshed brain. 
A popular study by DeskTime, a productivity app, found that employees work most efficiently on intervals of 52-minute work periods and 17-minute breaks. However, this schedule may not be ideal for everyone. No matter what schedule you decide on, it is important to not only take breaks with unrelated activities but also to focus solely on studying during work periods. Despite what we may think of our multitasking abilities, human attention is highly limited, and we can only do one thing well at a time.
We’ve all heard that repetition is the key to learning, but mindless repetition alone won’t help you remember the material. Instead, information must be rehearsed in varied, meaningful ways. So, instead of reading over your notes over and over or listening to the same lecture again, it would be more effective to use a combination of study strategies, such as explaining the information to someone else and drawing diagrams. 
Using both verbal and visual study methods is important because it allows the brain to perform dual coding, a theory formulated by psychologist Allan Paivio. According to his theory, storing information, especially abstract concepts, using two types of encoding results in stronger long-term memories and better recall, since visual and verbal information is processed and stored in two separate pathways in the brain.
In addition to dual coding, another way to enhance long-term memory storage is by connecting newly learned information to existing knowledge, using a process known as cognitive elaboration. Through cognitive elaboration, we expand the semantic networks that we use to organize information in our minds — a simple example is learning the word “crab” and connecting it to “ocean,” which is connected to “beach” and so on. By connecting new concepts to old material, we increase the number of retrieval cues available for those concepts, making it more likely for us to remember them come exam time.
Another effective way to study is to test yourself in the same format that the exam will be given in. For example, to study for a multiple-choice exam, it would be helpful to quiz yourself by writing your own multiple-choice questions and the possible set of answers. 
A study by two psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis found that college students who studied a prose passage and then took a practice test remembered more of the passage than students who simply studied the passage twice. This testing effect applied to exams given five minutes after or a week later, so no matter when your test is, it may be worth your time to quiz yourself on what you’ve studied instead of just reading over the material again.
Finally, it goes without saying that it’s important to get a good night’s sleep after studying. This may be the most restated piece of advice, but it has a neurological basis. According to a review by neuroscientists Björn Rasch and Jan Born, sleep is crucial to the consolidation of memory into long-term memory because the sleeping brain is optimal for the chemical and neuronal processes involved in this stage of cognitive processing.
With these study tips in mind, you’ll be ready to tackle finals week without all the stress that usually comes with it.

In the wake of the college admissions scandal, USC and the universities involved are still scrambling to pick up the pieces. The once mysterious and overlooked admissions process is now under national scrutiny, as prospective students around the country wonder whether their application will be thrown out in favor of those like Olivia Jade Giannulli.
Though USC has taken several measures in an attempt to rectify the damage already done, a more systematic approach is necessary to encourage long-term improvement to the admissions process.
So far, changes have included firing senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic, both associated with the scheme. Former faculty member Homayoun Zadeh of the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry was also placed on leave for paying a college consultant $100,000 to bribe an administrator from the athletic department to admit his daughter as a lacrosse player, even though she does not play the sport. 
Actress Lori Loughlin’s daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli, were initially accepted to USC as fake rowing recruits after she and her husband Mossimo paid $500,000 at the request of Operation Varsity Blues mastermind William “Rick” Singer. They were unenrolled from the University, confirmed in October. The University has said it will fully cooperate in the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation.
However, steps like these, while effective in addressing the immediate fallout as a result of the scandal, ultimately fall short of putting an end to the issue entirely. Firing, rescinding and prosecuting the individuals involved is like cutting some of the branches off an infected tree and expecting it to get better. Corruption in the college admissions process is more deep-rooted than that, and it will continue to exist so long as socioeconomic inequity remains in the higher education system.
In a March letter addressed to the USC community, Interim President Wanda Austin said that the University was in the process of conducting an internal investigation into the scandal. She said USC would also determine an appropriate way to redirect the money received in connection with the scandal to fund scholarships for underprivileged students. This is a more effective way to go about addressing the scandal as it tackles the underlying problem within the admissions process: socioeconomic inequity. 
Socioeconomic inequity in the higher education system leaves some students able to pay their way into college and others without the resources to get there at all. It seems everything that a student might use to strengthen their application — from standardized test scores to extracurriculars — can be paid for with money, and USC should ensure that this does not increase a student’s chance of admission.
In a letter a month later, Austin explained that USC’s internal investigations were continuing, and she announced the three changes made to the review of student-athlete applications. One measure includes a three-level approval system in which each student-athlete’s file must be reviewed by the head coach, the senior sports administrator and the USC Office of Athletics Compliance before it is forwarded to admissions. 
This should prevent fabricated athletic applications from entering the applicant pool. It is systematic reforms like these that will ensure that all students accepted to USC are up to par with the academic standards that the University claims to uphold.
If it were only a matter of individuals doing bad things, the issue would be resolved once those who committed the crime are punished. But the problems will persist, not because of the poor choices of these individuals, but because our society allows — even encourages — these individuals to make poor choices. Though the scandal brought to light the illegal ways in which the wealthy were cheating the system, there are legal means through which they have been able to buy their children’s way into college for decades.
As a next step, USC should consider phasing out the legacy system. USC’s Class of 2023 includes 17% legacy students or “Scions,” which is two percentage points greater than the percentage of first-generation college students. Legacy status is also considered in the application process for those who would like to transfer to the University through the Trojan Transfer Plan. 
The legacy system potentially undermines the diversity that USC promotes, as accepted Scions are repeatedly pulled from the same families and backgrounds. It is also disadvantageous to those of low socioeconomic status because they are often not already a part of the Trojan Family network.
Going forward, USC must show that even if wealthy parents continue to try to buy their children’s way into college, which they likely will, it is an institution that does not allow this. The University should not play into society’s tendency to favor the upper class but should instead acknowledge and reward hard work and academic and athletic merit.
