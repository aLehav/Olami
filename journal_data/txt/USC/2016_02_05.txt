Pat Haden will retire from his position as athletic director at USC effective at the end of June, President C. L. Max Nikias announced in a statement Friday.
Haden will remain at the university until 2017 to guide the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s renovation.
“Pat has accomplished USC’s objectives here through his distinct blend of integrity, energy, wisdom, and character,” Nikias said. “During a time in which intercollegiate athletics has been undergoing unpredictable transformation at a national level, Pat developed and executed a blueprint for how athletics and academics can reinforce one another at an academically elite private research university with a public-minded mission.”
Haden has run the athletic program since 2010, overseeing a tumultuous period as a result of sanctions imposed on the football team. He infamously fired head football coach Lane Kiffin in 2013 and relieved Steve Sarkisian of his duties this past season following Sarkisian’s issues with alcohol addiction. Haden hired interim head coach Clay Helton on a full-time basis following a win over UCLA last season.
The 63-year old Haden had been battling health concerns the past few months. Last October, Haden collapsed on the sidelines prior to USC’s matchup against Notre Dame in South Bend and resigned from the College Football Playoff selection committee, explaining that his doctors advised him against the tough travel.
After serving as USC’s athletic director for just over five years, Haden leaves the athletics program in better shape than where it was when he took over in 2010 after succeeding Mike Garrett. During his tenure, USC has claimed 10 national championships. Haden also added two new sports in women’s lacrosse and beach volleyball.
“I’m not interested in the legacy of Pat Haden,” Haden told the Daily Trojan in October. “I want us to continue to improve, and I don’t feel like I need to be remembered for anything. Somebody’s going to take my place and continue to do this job and do it better than I — that’s the idea.”

During my first semester as an editor at the Daily Trojan, I remember writing a last-minute feature for the news section in order to fill space. It was the first time I had ever written a feature. After I had finished it, my co-editor Sebastian read it over and asked me, “Jack, does being a creative writing major help you write stories?” My answer was no.
Though it may seem trivial to most, that interaction has always stuck with me because it’s a question that has followed me throughout both my college career as well my career with the Daily Trojan. While many of my journalism major peers discuss their Annenberg professors or Media Center horror stories in the lulls between the chaos of production, I spend my free time (when I can get it) writing short stories for class or reading books with character names I can’t pronounce. Is there a place for this in a world of factual reporting, tight deadlines and AP Style?
I would say so. Though they may seem like opposites on the surface, there isn’t much of a difference between a good short story and a good news story. Both have conflict, tension, action, heroes, villains and more. My classes have simply taught me how to spot it, and I notice it in the real world as well as the fictional realm.
Not only that, but as a news editor, I’ve also learned that there is a lot of room for creativity when it comes to writing headlines, decks and photo captions. Here, the vocabulary and critical thinking skills that my English classes have imbued me with is invaluable toward completing my job night after night.
But as much as my classes have affected how I approach working with the Daily Trojan, working for the Daily Trojan has been just as impactful on my writing. Though I’m no Ernest Hemingway, whose famously terse prose was shaped by his experiences writing for the Kansas City Star, the rigorous rules of AP Style, word count-conscious mindset and hatred of Oxford commas have affected the way I write in ways I never imagined it would when I applied to be a news writer three semesters ago.
This kind of relationship with the Daily Trojan applies to so many others besides me. At this publication, we have business students creating artwork, engineers writing about sports, and so many other people coming from all disciplines to make the paper that ends up on newsstands a reality. So if anyone reading this is thinking about writing for news — or any of our sections — but isn’t sure what they can contribute or what they’re going to get out of it, try it out. Trust me, the results are far greater than a bullet point on a resume.

With spring semester in full swing, students have begun to consider housing options for the upcoming school year. There’s a plethora of options around the USC area, including student housing, apartments, townhomes and much more. It’s no secret that securing future housing can be stressful, and it’s important to be aware of all options before settling. 
Last summer, I had an internship in West LA that required me to commute to the office a few times a week. After living the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. life for a few months, I learned both of the advantages and disadvantages of commuting.
Pros: 
Cons:
All in all the experience of commuting has its ups and downs, but if you’re up for the challenge, it can help prepare you for upcoming challenges that you’re likely to face post graduation. Working commuting into your daily schedule will not only help with time management but also with overall responsibility. If you’re from around town, I would say it’s worth trying for a semester.
