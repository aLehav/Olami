Coming off of a monumental win against No. 1 UCLA, the No. 4 USC women’s tennis team defend their regular season Pac-12 title this weekend in Ojai, Calif. for the Pac-12 Championship.
“If we do well this weekend it’s great, but if we falter it’s not a huge deal,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “It will be nice not playing a dual mach, which is a very hair matchup, and with the great schedule we played this year mixing up with these teams again will keep up fresh.”
With the Bruins (21-2, 8-2) all but ready to crown themselves Pac-12 champs Friday, the Women of Troy (20-3, 9-1) and their young squad had another idea in mind.
“They’re a very good team [UCLA], but they were getting ready for a coronation on Friday and even invited the Tennis Channel to the game,” Gallien said. “Our girls weren’t having anything off it, though, and even after getting barbecued by the crowd early as the day went on we arm-wrestled them down and got a tough win.”
After losing their previous two matches this season to UCLA, it was no wonder the Bruins’ confidence was sky-high. Just like they had done all season, though, the Women of Troy fought back strong and even stole the elusive doubles’ point to jump out to an early match lead.
“Doubles was so important for us and there were a a couple of matches that were so close like [Valeria] Pulido’s match and Zoe [Scandalis’] that could’ve went into three sets,” Gallien said. “The match I felt we had to have was at No. 2 with Danielle Lao, but by the end we had won the match before she finished.”
For freshman Scandalis, her victory against Robin Anderson had multiple implications. Unlike her one-on-one victory against UCLA’s Robin Anderson earlier on this year in Las Vegas, this win was done in a team forum with the entire Women of Troy squad rooting her on. On top of that, this specific victory moved her all the way up to No. 13 in nation, which puts her in the top-16, guaranteeing her a spot on the All-American team.
Along with the doubles team of sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria, who have clinched All-American spots, Scandalis could also be joined by junior Lao who may need a few wins this weekend to push her into the top-16.
“The future looks very good for us, there are a billion ridiculous dumb clichés in sports I can say, but the reality is that all you can hope for is the girls stay sharp, healthy and motivated, and I have no doubt this group will do this,” coach Gallien said.
Armed with four potential All-Americans and a Pac-12 title, the Women of Troy have all the firepower they need to make a deep tournament run. On top of the tangible aspects, USC has really coalesced to form a tight knit group made up of savvy veterans and eager younglings.
“It’s tough because the girls aren’t used to being on a team. That’s such a challenge and the three freshman who came in did a great job and senior Alison Ramos our captain did an awesome job relating to them,” Gallien said. “Everyone pulled their weight and it made my job easier and more fun.”

With these words, professor David Belasco of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies introduced Caine Monroy, the youngest speaker the center has ever hosted for his Wednesday night class, Entrepreneurial Mindset: Taking the Leap.
Nine-year-old Monroy stars in a video by filmmaker Nirvan Mullick that features his homemade cardboard box arcade in the auto parts and salvage yard owned by his father, George, called Smart Parts on Mission Road in Los Angeles. The film went viral on April 9.

Belasco invited Monroy to speak about his starting the arcade.
“Caine is the embodiment of fun and perseverance. He didn’t do it to make money, he did it to have fun and give people an experience,” Belasco said. “If you give people a great experience, they will come.”
The roughly 10-minute film, which now has more than 7 million views online, outlines Monroy’s journey to success. He set up the cardboard arcade outside his father’s shop in June where he sat outside every day waiting for customers. Finally, in August, Mullick walked into the shop to get his car fixed and became Monroy’s first customer.
“Caine had spend the entire summer setting up this experience, and I was the guy who to got to experience Caine acting out everything he made,” Mullick said. “It brought me back to my childhood and inspired me to make this film.”
Mullick decided to plan a flash mob to bring customers to Monroy’s arcade. He made a Facebook event, and eventually, Monroy’s story appeared on the homepage of the content-sharing website Reddit. The success of the flash mob and Monroy’s business became the premise of his film.
Before posting the video online, Monroy’s family and Mullick set up a scholarship fund for Caine. The money raised will also go towards funding creativity and entrepreneurship for kids, Mullick said. The foundation has now raised almost $200,000, and the Goldhirsch Foundation has agreed to match the donations dollar-for-dollar up to $250,000.
“It was an insane, incredible, phenomenal response, and we were unprepared for it,” Mullick said.
Monroy said that his idea for the arcade came when his father was throwing away boxes at his business.
“I could make something out of them,” Monroy said. “I just cut them up.”
Monroy’s personal qualities have made him a successful entrepreneur with a bright future ahead because, “he likes to sell, he likes to satisfy customers, and he’s creative,” Mullick said.
Monroy’s father said he has learned about the power of the internet from the experience.
“I have like three friends on my Facebook. [Caine] has 107,000,” George Monroy said. “He’s making more money than I am.”
Monroy hopes to be “someone that invents games,” when he grows up, he said. Monroy’s drive to have fun is what has made his story so popular, Mullick said.
“That’s what’s exciting about Caine’s story,” he said. “It’s inviting everybody to play.”

Numerous measures will be added to secure public safety in and around the university, including additional Los Angeles Police Department officers, technology and education.
At a press conference in Town & Gown on Thursday, President C.L. Max Nikias, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa addressed safety of students and southwest Los Angeles, following the deaths of Ying Wu and Ming Qu, two international Viterbi School of Engineering students who were fatally shot April 11 on Raymond Avenue near University Park Campus.

“USC has a strong and lengthy partnership with city hall and with LAPD, and we are very pleased with their resolute efforts,” Nikias said. “We all care so much about the security of our students and our community … Together we are taking even greater measures to secure the safety and security of our entire USC community.”
The number of Department of Public Safety officers and Campus Cruiser drivers will increase, Nikias said. The university will also emphasize students’ education about safety.
“Safety is a shared responsibility,” Nikias said. “The safety principle [students] learn can increase their personal safety no matter where they are around the world.”
Thirty police officers have been added to LAPD’s Southwest Division, which serves the USC area, in addition to four officers and a detective specifically for USC, Beck said.
“Their task will be to make sure that the surrounding and residential areas around ‘SC where so many students live will be safe,” Beck said.
The LAPD plans to bring its predicting policing model to the Southwest Division, which has proven to be their most successful crime-fighting tool, Beck said. The focus of the tool will be property crime.
“Property crime is a feeding pool for violent crime,” Beck said. “Keeping its ‘SC property safe is the beginning of decreasing violent crime.”
DPS and LAPD will work together more closely and employ available crime-fighting technology tools, including selecting locations to install additional cameras, Beck said.
“We’re going to leverage the technology that ‘SC has employed so successfully as a crime-fighting tool around the school,” said Beck,
The LAPD and DPS changes and additions will be funded by the university.
Despite these changes, Beck said violent crime in and around the university has decreased by 27 percent in the area over the past two years, and the murder of Wu and Qu was an isolated incident.
“This is an awful singular incident, but this is not the trend in the ‘SC area,” Beck said. “This is not us trying to catch up. This is us addressing an awful singular incident.”
Beck said he could not disclose details about the investigation of Wu and Qu’s murder because of its sensitive nature, but said a resolution will be reached soon.
“I’m pleased with the progress to date,” Beck said. “I am confident in the detectives. I am confident in the investigative process going forward.”
Villaraigosa said the tragic incident affected everyone throughout Los Angeles.
“What happened a few weeks ago was not only something that affected the student body but something that tore at the heartstrings of Angelenos throughout the city,” Villaraigosa said. “Whenever young, innocent kids are brutally attacked in the way that they were, you have to say, ‘No, not in my city. No, not in our city.’”
According to Nikias, parents have contacted the university looking for information about safety around campus. He said the safety and security of every parent’s child is always on the mind of the university.
Villaraigosa said the safety of students has always been a priority for the city.
“The City of Los Angeles, ‘SC and the police department have had a strong relationship over the years,” Villaraigosa said. “We’re doing everything we can to keep the university safe.”
 
So this means Chipotle will be even safer than before?!  Seriously, the taxpayers are footing a bill so cops can write jaywalking tickets and get revenue for their broke police department.  The points about breaking the law are fine and all, but when we have people out there with guns committing violent crime, you’d think students drinking on porches or selling study aids should take a back burner.
I am really disappointed in LAPD. 
No, I am not advocating that USC students be allowed to commit minor crimes (such as traffic violation or underage possession of alcohol), but I do believe that the resources devoted to preventing those minor violations could be better used to prevent violent crime.
During the day, you can always seen a handful of LAPD officers on bicycles writing tickets to students riding, instead of walking, their bike across the intersection. If you are in one of the dangerous streets to the west of campus, you probably won’t see an LAPD officer until someone actually fires a gun or calls 911. 
To those advocating that LAPD continue to monitor USC student at crosswalks or try and crackdown on the stoners in the dormitories: remember that police officers are a limited resource and that for every officer waiting at Jefferson and McClintock, we have one less officer on 36th and Catalina.
Let’s hope the increase in the number of LAPD officers around campus leads to the busts of some
students who are doing selling or using illegal drugs and who should never have been accepted at USC.
Mike:
Crime is crime.  Break the law, deal with the consequences.
Let’s just hope that the increase of LAPD officers in the surrounding USC area decreases the amount of crime and not only increases the number of bike traffic tickets given to USC students.
Lets hope students not only follow follow safety guideline but also the law.
