Like many freshmen at USC, Meghan Johnson, an undeclared freshman, is stressed. She is taking a biology class, a chemistry class and  Johnson is enrolled in Thematic Option.

“There’s just a lot of work for those classes, so there is stress to do well on them and get everything done on time,” Johnson said.
This year’s college freshmen have the highest levels of emotional stress in 25 years, according to an annual survey conducted by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute.
The results of the survey, “The American Freshman,” are generally considered the most comprehensive representation of the emotional well-being of college freshmen. This year’s survey consulted more than 200,000 incoming freshmen at 279 four-year colleges across the country.
Only 51.9 percent of students rated their emotional health as “above average,” a decrease of 3.4 percent from 2009.
Because stress levels are higher than ever, the number of students seeking out help has risen, as well.
To adapt to the growth in demand, USC increased its counseling staff last spring. Two half-time psychiatrists and one full-time employee who helps students with referrals for therapy off campus have been hired, Rosenstein wrote.
“Grades, parents putting pressure on you because they want you to get good grades, scholarships to keep, there’s a lot of stressful things,” said Helene Jouin, a junior majoring in environmental engineering.
The survey also revealed an important gender gap: Less than half of the female students surveyed described themselves as emotionally healthy, compared with 59.1 percent of male students.
Dr. Ilene Rosenstein, director of Counseling Services at USC, said in an e-mail that, in general, females also seek out counseling more than males. At USC, 60 percent of the Counseling Service’s clients are female, Rosenstein wrote.
“We clearly have seen nationally and at USC an increase in symptoms in young adults,” Rosenstein wrote. “It is true at all college counseling centers across the U.S. that the numbers of students seeking counseling has increased significantly, doubling and tripling over the last decade. Universities have increased staff, understanding the importance of quick access to counseling, so minor problems don’t become bigger issues … We will continue to offer preventive programs while balancing the need for clinical demands.”
The results of the study also underscore the influence of the economic downturn and how it creates additional stress for students who worry about being able to pay for college. According to 62.1 percent of students in the survey, the recession impacted their college choice.
The anxiety induced by economic hardship doesn’t end once that choice is made. Dr. Kelly Greco, staff psychologist at Counseling Services, said she observes students facing the challenges of today’s economic climate.
“In terms of how the economy hits, how people survive financially and how this impacts [a student’s] family — so maybe they need to pick up a job because their family can’t support them anymore. I really see how this impacts them on a day-to-day basis, and then their academics,” Greco said.
According to the survey, more freshmen now depend on loans, grants and scholarships to pay for college. USC raised its financial aid budget this school year in response to increased need.
Many students find scholarships difficult to come by. Anar Bhansali, a sophomore majoring in business administration, has experienced anxiety in her search for scholarships.
“It’s very disappointing when you apply for so many and don’t get the scholarship that you want,” Bhansali said.
And though financial aid does relieve some stress, it comes with its own pressures.
Kristin Burger, an undeclared freshman, said she regularly experiences this pressure.
“Just being here costs a lot, so I have to watch everything,” Burger said.
With increased stress levels, it’s crucial that students learn the coping skills necessary to deal with stress.
“I can’t always do as well as I want to and that’s stressful,” Jouin said. “To cope, I run a lot. I feel like exercise makes such a difference, because when I exercise it’s a good way to vent.”
Greco emphasized the importance of being aware of outside resources, such as counseling services at the University Park Health Center, and having a network of people — peers, family, faculty and advisers — to rely on.
“It’s really important that people continue to reach out and get the support that they need and use coping skills,” Greco said.
“It is true at all college counseling centers across the U.S. that the numbers of students seeking counseling has increased significantly, doubling and tripling over the last decade,” Rosenstein wrote. “The good news is that treatment, including therapy, works and gives lifelong skills to help students reach their goals.”

The Undergraduate Student Government allocated $175 on Tuesday to the purchase of 1,000 stickers, to be placed in on-campus bathrooms, that will remind students to be conscious of paper towel usage.
The stickers read, “Remember … These Come From Trees. This sticker will save up to 100 lbs. of paper every year. Help spread the word. Get yours at TheseComeFromTrees.com.”
Students are not sure if this will have a significant impact.
“People just get paper towels as they need them. Most educated people are aware that paper towels come from trees,” said Jasmine Wasserman, a freshman majoring in communication.
USC has been increasing its efforts to go green in the last year, with the Office of Sustainability releasing a baseline report on greenhouse gas emissions for 2001-2009 in January. The university also received a B- on its College Sustainability Report Card in October, and USC Transportation won an award for its sustainability efforts in September. USG University Affairs Director Tim Sae Koo said that he plans to package the stickers and present them to managers of USC buildings.
“It’ll be up to their discretion if and how they put them up,” Sae Koo said. “We didn’t want them to think it was vandalism.”
These stickers reduced paper towel consumption by 29 percent at the Hunt Valley Elementary School,  according to Ben James, the third-grade teacher who conducted the study.
“This is a no-brainer, a low-cost way that won’t take a lot of work to potentially make a big environmental impact,” said Howard Wright, a member of the University Affairs committee.
Greek Senator Michael Geragos said this is a great example of how USG is working to improve the environment.
“It’s just a way to have students really see the way that we’re working to help the environment,” Geragos said.
Sorry, this action actually doesn’t represent USG “helping” the environment at all. It will likely have exactly no impact on the use of paper towels, it’s patronizing, and I agree with the last post- the stickers will get worn and ugly quick. If I managed any of the buildings, I’d refuse to stick them anywhere. How about stickers on the computers telling us the power comes from coal and oil? Or stickers in the parking garages encouraging us to drive less? Or stickers in Traddies saying “alcohol is bad for you”?
This has to be one of the stupidest ideas that I have ever heard. When I go into the bathroom, I have no interest in hearing about how paper towels come from trees. I know that they come from trees. They are made of paper; it is obvious. I also know, however, that the trees that supply the wood pulp for paper are very different from other kinds of trees. In fact, they are generally grown for that purpose! I find it distasteful to defile clean walls with stickers that will peel and age and are horrendously ugly to begin with.
So nice job, USG. You’re saving the environment. You might have started to offset the environmental damage caused by my parents’ new Honduras Mahogany dining room set. Keep up the good work.

President C. L. Max Nikias took the stage of Bovard Auditorium shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday to tell students about his goals to connect with the community and to provide additional undergraduate housing.
The first ever presidential address to students drew a modest turnout, with about a hundred empty seats on the first level of Bovard.
The 34-minute speech centered on community service and the relationship between USC and its surrounding neighborhoods — a relationship that, Nikias stressed, must be symbiotic.
Speech · President C. L. Max Nikias gave the University’s first presidential address to students in Bovard Auditorium yesterday. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan 
“Great universities must be respectful partners with our communities. That is the ethos that USC brings. We respect and cherish our community and we learn humbly from our community,” Nikias said.
With that, Nikas outlined some of the previously announced initiatives USC has planned for its neighbors: expanding security west of campus, providing free high-speed Internet access to the 100 homes closest to the university and creating a new job development program for area businesses.
He also touched on USC’s Master Plan, a 30-year blueprint for development of the campus and surrounding area. Nikias assured the audience that additional housing for undergraduate and graduate students was a key component to that development.
“All this allows you to embrace your campus,” Nikias said.
Part of the reason campus development is important, Nikias explained, is that as the global community’s attention continues to shift toward Asia and the Pacific Rim, more attention will be placed on Los Angeles and, in turn, USC.
“Los Angeles and this university are the natural hub for this new world,” he said.
Nikias also challenged students to take advantage of the opportunities Los Angeles has to offer, commending programs like those offered by the Undergraduate Student Government that provide students free trips throughout the city.
“You can strengthen USC through one particular essential way — I want each of you and all of you to celebrate this city,” Nikias said.
Looking inward, Nikias outlined several major initiatives the university will undertake this year, the most significant of which is a fundraising campaign that Nikias called the “most ambitious” in USC’s history.
No goals have been finalized, but Nikias’ announcement that he intends to raise $1 billion in an endowment for scholarships for both undergraduate and graduate students drew a few gasps from the audience.
During a 10-minute question and answer session following his remarks, Nikias also outlined plans for the new University Park Health Center, saying it will break ground this year and will be completed by December 2012.
“I know it took some time, thank you for you patience,” he said.
He also said that although USC is weighing whether or not to purchase the Los Angeles Coliseum, a potential purchase is not on his list of priorities.
“This is a work in progress,” Nikias said. “I really don’t know where this might lead.”
Nikias, who has made engagement with students a cornerstone of his presidency thus far, announced his plans for the address in November, crediting USG President Chris Cheng with giving him the idea.
“It hasn’t been six months since his inauguration, and President Nikias has already demonstrated that staying connected with the students is one of his utmost priorities,” Cheng said in his introduction Tuesday. “He diligently works to keep his thumb on the pulse of the student body.”
After Tuesday’s speech, Nikias said he was glad he had the opportunity to hear from the students. The question and answer session, he said, was something he pushed for.
“I loved it. I love the questions from the students, that was the best part,” he said. “I thought it was better to interact with the audience than to go up there and just speak.”
Joe Franco, a senior majoring in accounting, said he believed the speech did not distinguish Nikias’ plans from former USC President Steven B. Sample.
“[I’m] not too familiarized with [President] Nikias. Not too much has changed in my eyes,” Franco said. “He’s kind of just extending Sample’s vision.”
Stephen McAfee, a freshman majoring in engineering, said she enjoyed seeing this side of Nikias.
“[President Nikias is] actually pretty approachable. I didn’t think [his speech] would be like that,” McAfee said.
Overall, Nikias’ message to the students was clear: Though USC has made great strides in recent decades, there is still room for improvement.
“As you all know, the last leg of the great climb is always the steepest and the hardest and the most difficult,” Nikias said. “It is also the most memorable and the most rewarding.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that “President C. L. Max Nikias took the stage of Bovard Auditorium shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday to provide additional undergraduate housing.” Nikias only mentioned providing additional housing as a goal.

Total Voters: 143
Im glad the President is so connected to the students. My question is, When is he going to start connecting with us, FMS and the rest of us in the background keeping this Campus and the buildings running. So far the year of the employee has been an utter flop. Maybe, just maybe, we will some day get the recognition from this university that we deserve.
I hope additional student housing actually means additional university-run housing. It doesn’t really help most lower- and middle-class students for private hosting companies to build palatial luxury condos like Gateway and Tuscany near campus. As much as some people may not like living in university housing, it keeps costs down, provides school-year long leases, eliminates predatory landlords, and keeps students engaged with university activities. The last thing we need is USC to turn the UV over to a private housing manager to build luxury apartments with plasma TVs and hot tubs that only kids with a sugar-daddy can really afford.

The USC men’s golf team looks to ride its fall season momentum into the spring this week as it kicks off its 21st annual Amer Ari Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii.
The team finished up this fall with three top-five finishes in a row and looks to repeat that performance at the 20-team invitational.

The tournament, hosted by the University of Hawaii at Manao and the University of Hawaii of Hilo, will take place at the Waikoloa Kings’ Course, a course USC has yet to play on.
In addition to USC and the hosts, Arizona State University, Stanford University, UCLA, Washington, Oregon and others will be competing.
“We want to win, and we’re definitely capable of it,” said sophomore Martin Trainer. “Four of our guys finished in the top seven places at events last year, so we are strong enough to win.”
Bolstered by its strong fall play, and traveling with a well-tested squad, USC looks to be in the chase throughout the tournament.
The Trojans will be led by junior Steve Lim, an All-Pac 10 athlete in 2010, and sophomore T.J. Vogel, a 2010 Freshman All-American.
Vogel led the team this fall with three top-five finishes.
Vogel posted the team’s lowest score this fall, hitting for second place at the U.S. Collegiate Championships with a 7-under-par 209.
Vogel also finished fourth at the Jack Nicklaus Invitational.
Lim is USC’s most consistent golfer, with 14 sub-70 rounds, but he only competed in three events this fall.
His best showing was a sixth place finish at the U.S. Collegiate Championships.
The squad is rounded out by Trainer, and freshmen Ramsey Sahyoun and Jeffrey Kang.
Trainer played well this fall, finishing seventh at the Gilford Intercollegiate and eighth at the Bill Cullum Invitational, generally posting scores that put him in the top three on the team.
Kang competed in four events this fall, his best the Jack Nicklaus Invitational where he tied for a career-best fourth place and finished first for the team.
Sahyoun is coming off a fall season that saw him playing twice and never quite breaking above the middle of the pack for the tee — his best effort was a tie for 18th at the Gifford Intercollegiate.
Sophomore Sam Smith, who competed twice with the team in the fall, will be competing as an individual.
Despite a rough fall and plenty of uncertainty as the new season begins, the team remains hopeful.
“T.J. is one of the best golfers in the country, and Steve is right up with him,” Trainer said. “We’ve all had some really good events. We’re a lot better than our rankings.”
Action starts today, at 5:30 p.m.

Report: Pomee settles on the trojans
Four-star wide receiver/tight end Junior Pomee (Moreno Valley, Calif.) has committed to USC, according to Lya Wodraska of the Salt Lake Tribune.
Pomee gave a verbal commitment to the Trojans just days after visiting the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah.
“We are glad to finally get it over with,” his father, Kapelieli Pomee, told Wodraska on Monday night. “Mainly he wanted to stay close to his family.”
Pomee’s decision could likely result in three-star cornerback Ryan Henderson (Moreno Valley, Calif.) signing with USC on National Signing Day, as well. Henderson, a long-time Utah commit and teammate of Pomee, had recently said he was split 50-50 between the Utes and Trojans.
Many have speculated, however, that if Pomee signs with USC, Henderson will quickly follow suit.

four-star recruit Grimble decommits
Jalen Grimble (Las Vegas), who is rated as the No. 7 defensive tackle in the nation by Scout.com, withdrew his verbal commitment to play for USC, according to the Las Vegas Sun.
The 6-foot-4, 255-pound defensive lineman from Bishop Gorman High School verbally committed to USC last May but is no longer being recruited by the Trojans, according to the report.
According to a press release from his high school promoting the school’s signing day event, Grimble will choose to play for either Miami (Fla.) or UCLA on Wednesday.
Rivals.com also lists Nebraska as a possible destination for the highest-rated recruit from Nevada.
Verbal commitments, such as the one Grimble gave to USC in May, are non-binding. Commitments only become official when an athlete signs his letter of intent.

Roberson to sign with florida or usc
Four-star cornerback Marcus Roberson (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) will sign a letter of intent Wednesday to play college football at either Florida or USC, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.
Roberson committed to Auburn on Monday, but withdrew his verbal commitment approximately 24 hours after.
This marked the second time the St. Thomas Aquinas High cornerback has rescinded a commitment.
Prior to committing to Auburn on Friday, Roberson had committed to Texas Tech Jan. 18, just days after visiting USC.
“I’m trying to do what’s best for me,” Roberson told the Sun-Sentinel. “The decision with Auburn was between me and the coaches there.”

We live in an age in which people are easily offended.
The most recent case of this modern day form of the blame game came from the visiting locker room of the McKale Memorial Center on Saturday night.
After an embarrassing 82-73 loss to the Arizona Wildcats, USC’s star junior forward Nikola Vucevic was rather candid with reporters about the team’s listless effort in defeat.
“I felt like we all played like women,” Vucevic said. “We didn’t play hard. Every single one of us just played like women.”
If you want to take those words at face value, it sounds like another testosterone-filled insinuation that female athletes don’t work as hard and are soft when it comes to collegiate competition.
But frankly, the world is not black and white, and so the frustrations of a post-game interview should not warrant judgment purely on the assumption of intention.
Would it have been in Vucevic’s best interest to have used different wording when addressing the media on the loss? Yes.
Did a cultural barrier likely distort the context and ultimate motivation behind the Montenegro-native’s English, which he just started learning four years ago? Yes.
But is the junior forward, and face of USC men’s basketball, a sexist whose comments show how the world of sports is still out of touch with the issue of gender equality?
That might be taking things too far.
Unlike Vucevic, who apologized Monday for how others interpreted his comments, I will not regret my decision not to toe the party line on this issue.
I am by no means a sexist, nor am I an apologist for vitriolic language. But frankly, I refuse to believe that the use of “women” in Vucevic’s remarks was intended to mock the role of the female athlete in sports.
The way I see it, Vucevic’s decision to employ the word “women” was largely to insist that his teammates failed to play at a level that would be competitive against a collegiate men’s basketball team.
That isn’t to say women’s basketball is inferior, or that Title IX has created a schism in the college game that on one side promotes a finesse, half-court game and on the other side promotes an aggressive, up-tempo, high-flying brand of basketball.
All the 6-foot-10, 240-pound forward was pointing out is that if you put a university’s women’s and men’s basketball teams on the same court, the outcome would probably be determined by a gross competitive advantage.
That assertion isn’t misogynistic, but simply a reality.
Apparently Javier Morales, a writer for the Tucson Citizen, doesn’t see it that way, however.
“Is this 2011 or 1971?” Morales said in his post-game blog. “Comments like [Vucevic’s] are so outdated and unwarranted in this day and age, especially when women’s basketball is covered more by the national media than ever before.”
Looking on the surface, I understand the semi-outrage at what others see as misguided sentiments But to those looking to make a claim that they were offended or felt victimized by Vucevic’s words, my advice is this: Before you castigate, try to deeply evaluate.
For instance, Vucevic’s love for basketball was not love at first sight, but more or less built on listening to the exploits of his mother Ljilana, who starred for the Yugoslavian National Team in the 1970s.
“I respect women’s sports as much as men’s sports,” Vucevic said during his apology. “[Disrespecting women] is the last thing I would do.”
It is a shame that this is the main issue getting the Trojans on local and national airwaves the past few days leading up to tonight’s rivalry game against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.
If there is a lesson to be learned from the outpour of negativity aimed at Vucevic because of Morales’ salacious form of journalism, it’s that before you attempt to drag someone’s reputation through the mud, you should dig a little deeper.
Although I understand the quote was the quote, failing to ask Vucevic to clarify his comments leaves plenty of grey area in a field where grey area typically isn’t acceptable, and usually isn’t promoted to the front page of a well-recognized newspaper’s website.
In the case of Nikola Vucevic, the story worth reporting is not driven by masculinity or sexism, but rather an admirable sense of respect for the game and all who play it.
“For The Love Of The Game” runs Wednesdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Dave at dulberg@usc.edu.
Mr. Dulberg,
Though I respect your opinion and your right to say it, I find your argument flawed on many levels.  I am left unconvinced of the innocence of Vucevic’s statement, and I find it disturbing that even though he apologized, you are willing to believe that he was still justified in his comments.
Best of luck,
AM
I don’t think it’s about people saying that Vucevic is sexist. We live in a very open and liberal society, especially as a liberal arts school in an American metropolitan area.
However, that doesn’t change the fact that a specific group of people feel insulted when they are referenced in a way that associates them with a negative experience. Regardless of whatever differences there may or may not be between men’s and women’s basketball, to associate women with a loss is to blatantly say that women define the weaknesses of the team.
America still has a lingering specter of elitism and privilege vs oppression. We’ve come a long way, but the journey isn’t over. It was only within the last century that women have become generally legal equals to men.
People pointing out Vucevic’s quote isn’t a personal attack (in the majority of cases, I assume), but rather a way to recognize that there are still issues that we need to deal with as a society, even if they are not as gross as they once were. Why not have that discussion at USC? And kudos to Vucevic for realizing this and owning up to his contribution to something that is still a problem for many, if not all, of us.

Last season, while serving his NCAA-mandated year on the bench after transferring to USC from Fordham, junior guard Jio Fontan only traveled on one of the Trojans’ road trips — the trek to Westwood, where he watched USC dismantle UCLA in Pauley Pavilion 67-46.
Inside presence · USC will look for a lift from seasoned senior center Alex Stepheson, who recorded a double-double in the Trojans’ January matchup at Galen Center against UCLA, finishing with 13 points and 16 rebounds in the victory. - Daily Trojan file phot
It was the biggest win by the Trojans over the Bruins since the 1945 season.
This year, Fontan was finally able to play against the crosstown rivals, scoring 10 points during USC’s 63-52 win in front of a sold-out crowd at the Galen Center Jan. 9.
“We would be lying if we said it was just another game,” Fontan said. “We wanted that game a lot more than we want some of the other games.”
In that game, junior forward Nikola Vucevic scored a game-high 20 points, helping the Trojans overcome a poor start and a halftime deficit.
Senior forward Alex Stepheson contributed 13 points and 16 rebounds, including six offensive rebounds.
This time around, Stepheson expects the Bruins to attack Vucevic and himself, but they will be prepared.
“I’m excited for the challenge,” Stepheson said. “They’re just as hungry as we are, but it’ll be a good matchup.”
With senior guard Marcus Simmons draped all over him, UCLA forward Tyler Honeycutt only scored 10 points Jan. 9 and tied his season-high with seven turnovers.
Bruins center Joshua Smith fouled out with eight points.
“We know that [UCLA] will play better next time,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill after the game.
The Trojans will find out whether the Bruins will play better in the second and final match-up of the rivalry in the regular season tonight at Pauley Pavilion.
“I’m sure they’re going to make some adjustments,” O’Neill said. “We’re making some, but I hope we’re able to execute.”
Since their last meeting, the teams have gone in opposite directions, with the Bruins going 5-1 and the Trojans compiling a 2-4 record.
Both teams just came off their road trips, where they both beat Arizona State and lost to Arizona.
The first half of conference play is done and the Trojans are now focused on controlling what they can control.
“For us, we’re trying to fight for a [NCAA tournament berth],” O’Neill said. “Whether we belong in that picture is debatable or not, but we hope we have an opportunity for that.”
During his tenure at USC, O’Neill  is undefeated in three games against UCLA, and the Trojans have beaten the Bruins four games in a row.
But for USC to extend that win streak, O’Neill believes the team will need to rely on its defense.
“I want us to play with a defensive edge,” O’Neill said. “This is a fact — if we don’t defend, we can lose to anyone. If we do defend, we have an opportunity to beat anyone.”
With the opportunity to start the second half of conference play on the right foot, USC is looking to push its win streak to five games over UCLA, which would be the longest since the team won a school-record 42 consecutive games over a span of 12 seasons (1932-43).
“If we’re fortunate to win tomorrow, it’ll be huge for us,” O’Neill said. “If we do what we’re supposed to do, [we’ll be] fine.

Here are some more thoughts from O’Neill after Tuesday’s practice:

After one year in Seattle, Rocky Seto is headed back to Los Angeles.
This time, he will be the new defensive coordinator for UCLA.
Serving as the defensive quality control coach for Seattle this past season, Seto was recently promoted to help coach the Seahawks secondary on Jan. 18.
The Seahawks clinched the NFC West in the last week of the regular season, and pulled off an improbable upset by defeating the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the divisional round of the playoffs.
Before moving to the NFL, Seto served a total of 11 years on the USC staff, helping with the linebackers, secondary and as the defensive coordinator for the Trojans most recently during the 2009 football season.
A press conference is scheduled for tomorrow.
I thought the DT covers USC topics per se? Who cares what goes on in Westwood? this is classic inferiority complex syndrome. Unless Westwood does something that involves us directly, then who cares?
You got Arty above, using words like “bullsh’t” and you DT mods don’t a thing about it. 
The DT needs to start requiring everyone who comments to enter a valid email; this way the comments will be more civil.

“Magical” is a word frequently used to describe the writing of Alice Hoffman, but that does not, by any means, make her a predecessor to J.K. Rowling.
There are no wizards or sorcerers in Hoffman’s novels, though witches or apparitions do occasionally weave themselves in and out of her narratives. 
Instead, Hoffman’s magic is seamlessly and ironically juxtaposed with realism as she explores the innate bonds between mothers, daughters and sisters, along with the human race’s inexplicable ties to plants, animals and the wild temperament of Mother Nature.
Hoffman, a prolific novelist who has penned more than 30 books, let an audience of devoted readers in on the secrets to her inspiration Monday.
The event that took place at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills was sponsored by Writers Bloc Los Angeles, a lecture series that hosts novelists, journalists and screenwriters.
Just as her characters come to understand the mysticism that flourishes in their lives, Hoffman said she uncovers magic every day when she settles before her laptop in a quiet room.
“Fiction really comes alive when the characters start to have enough life that they make their own decisions,” Hoffman said. “The process is finding out what the story really is.”
KUSC program director and radio host Gail Eichenthal mediated Monday night’s discussion, which mostly centered on Hoffman’s latest novel, The Red Garden.
The novel links together 14 stories, each of which easily could stand on its own.
The Red Garden is both Hoffman’s love letter to New England, where she has lived for 30 years, and an artwork of storytelling.
Beginning in 1750, the novel explores nearly 300 years of history of a small Massachusetts town through its people, its ghosts and even its animals.
“[The Red Garden] is really about the importance of stories and how family stories become history,” Hoffman said. “Over the 300-year history of this town, the stories that people tell each other become shared mythologies.
It is appropriate, then, that the first tales Hoffman remembers hearing as a child were from her Russian grandmother, which led to her fascination with these often whimsical oral histories.
“I was also a fairytale and folk-tale fanatic. I think that gave me the first sense that literature and magic go hand-in-hand,” Hoffman said.
A voracious reader in her teens, Hoffman was inspired by J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, immediately enraptured by Holden Caulfield’s distinct voice.
“It was the first time I felt that a character was speaking directly to me. There’s this intimacy and this feeling that you’re known in some way,” Hoffman said. “I feel like that’s what you want from fiction — you want to feel known when you read a novel.”
Hoffman and Salinger’s voices differ, but they do share a brilliance in their language, which Hoffman refined at Stanford University, where she received her MFA in creative writing in the early 1970s.
While at Stanford, Hoffman not only honed her style but also realized that writing was her true vocation.
“Nobody cares if you get up every day and write. There has to be some reason you get up every day to do it,” she said. “I don’t think it’s so much you have a story to tell, it’s that you have questions you need answered. You’re writing to find answers to certain questions.”
These questions keep Hoffman’s work grounded in everyday situations and sentiments, despite the occasional forays into the mystical.
A breast cancer survivor, Hoffman continued to craft narratives while undergoing radiation treatment ­— an experience that inspired several of her novels, including The Ice Queen.
“I was writing these stories to give myself the strength,” Hoffman said.
As much as Hoffman has drawn from her life and the world around her, she also insists that one doesn’t always have to undergo an experience in order to understand it as a writer.
“You’re told as a writer to ‘write what you know,’ and I don’t believe that,” she said. “You should write what you feel.”

Can a poem be danced? Can the human body capture the dips and beats of a Shakespearean sonnet? Can the body reflect the expressive, sometimes inflammatory voice of the spoken word?
These questions, and many more, were explored Monday night in the Visions & Voices event, Dancing the Poem.
Photo by Niranjan Madhavan
Organized by USC faculty members Carol Muske-Dukes and Margo Apostolos, Dancing the Poem explored the relationship between poetry and dance, and between spoken and written poetry. The event featured the Get Lit Players, an award-winning teen poetry troupe from Los Angeles, in collaboration with the Poetry Dance Troupe from USC’s School of Theatre.
A surprisingly young and diverse crowd appeared at the event, including students from two schools of the USC Family of Schools, Foshay Learning Center and Manual Arts High School.
With an obvious nod to West Side Story, the performance began with the audience in the midst of a furious gang battle between the “Page Poets” and the “Stage Poets.” The Stage Poets fiercely advocate for the spoken word, also known as slam poetry, while the Page Poets swear by classic, written poetry. With tensions boiling high and exclamations such as “Nobody remembers what hasn’t been written,” from one Page Poet, the battle for linguistic superiority begins.
Each poem was interpreted by dancers moving behind the poet as he or she read. Dancers glided across the stage in a variety of styles that included hip-hop, modern, salsa and even a smattering of tap dance. These diverse styles reflected the radically different poems read by each poet and by each school of poetry.
As each side took turns reading poems, no piece was the same as another. The poems ranged from short to extensive to quiet to explosive, producing a wide variety of reactions from the young audience. Some of the more culturally charged spoken-word poems drew quite a number of whoops.
Often, the performers took their pieces and transformed them into a memorable experience. Readings of “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” by T.S. Eliot and “I’m a Rapper” by Sekou “tha Misfit” were particularly stirring because of the speakers’ ability to bring the words to life with passion and enthusiasm.
The poetry and the dance seemed to flow into each other during certain pieces, while in others the two seemed to merely coexist. A tap dance interpretation of Gwendolyn Brook’s famous poem “We Real Cool” was particularly original in its ability to beat out the lines of the poem with surprising volume and rhythm.
This performance inspired many questions about what poetry is and even about what poetry is becoming. As lines between the old and new, traditional and contemporary and rap and poetry begin to blur, what can we regard as “real” poetry? With its clear hip-hop and rap influences, is spoken word or slam poetry in serious danger of making poetry cool?
Can the rhythm of a poem really be translated with a dancer’s leaps and bounds?
Many of these questions were probed in the fantastic finale of “Let America Be America Again,” a poem by Langston Hughes.
The concluding piece was a collaboration between the two schools, with three poets reading the poem together and responding to each other, while  excellent dancing glued the performance together. The poem itself is a critique of the American dream that has not yet come for lower-class Americans, but ends with a sense of hope that the dream is still forthcoming.
This final poem brings closure to the collision of cultures and art forms in “Dancing the Poem.” Dance and poetry did not always successfully exist as one performance in this event, though the imagination and desire to create art was evident in every performer.

Michael Jackson was arguably the first extremely popular, A-list pop star to play the Super Bowl halftime show. He performed at the Rose Bowl in 1993 during Super Bowl XXVII.
TV ratings skyrocketed during the performance, setting a precedent for highly anticipated, extravagant halftime performances with star musicians on the bill.
Eleven years later, the Jackson family made halftime performance history again. You know, the “wardrobe malfunction.” It was shocking and unusual, but also incredibly hilarious and entertaining. People talked about it for weeks.
Since the fateful “Nipplegate” scandal, however, the NFL has been playing it safe and selecting their performers very carefully.
The year after the infamous incident, for instance, Paul McCartney performed. The Beatles are the most influential and respected pop group of all time, and McCartney is old and calm. Safe choice.
In the five years following McCartney’s performance, the world has seen halftime shows by The Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band and The Who.
They are classic, timeless bands, bands that millions love and often pay hundreds of dollars to see perform. Basically, all safe choices as well.
People generally watch the Super Bowl for three reasons: the game, the commercials and the halftime show. These reasons are by no means mutually exclusive, as many people watch for the entire spectacle.
But the point is that, at least since MJ’s 1993 performance, the halftime show is one of the game’s main draws and thousands of people tune in to watch whoever is scheduled as the main entertainer.
Year after year, however, thousands of people are disappointed. Critics panned Bruce Springsteen for lip-synching, and people criticized The Who for being old and outdated and not performing in a grand way for such a large audience.
People  condemned Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake after their scandal, but many consider it the most memorable halftime performance in the last 15 years. The duo definitely delivered with high-level entertainment, even if they received a bit of bad press for a while.
Now, for the first time since the world saw more of Janet Jackson than it ever really wanted to see, a modern pop group is set to take the halftime show stage again.
Classic rock musicians might be generally more talented and critically appreciated, but modern pop groups are meant for commercially focused global events like the Super Bowl.
That’s why this Sunday’s performance by the Black Eyed Peas should appeal to a wider audience and ultimately prove more successful than performances of years past.

The performance should be entertaining because, finally, the NFL has made an unsafe choice. The Black Eyed Peas appeals to younger fans and is certainly not considered a timeless or classic group.
The lyrics are relatively controversial, as they have a hit about Fergie’s body called “My Humps” and another song called “Let’s Get Retarded,” which was later changed to “Let’s Get It Started.” Fergie even has had a Janet Jackson-like moment of her own, when she appeared to pee her pants on stage.
For the unique choice alone, I commend the NFL. It finally realized that mass audiences want younger, more popular groups who know how to put on an extravagant performance.
But, inevitably, the Black Eyed Peas will not be a total success. Older football fans will think they’re too young and not relatable.
Others will complain that the show is not spectacular enough. People will nitpick the performance to death. Hipster music snobs will shake their heads and head to the fridge for another Pabst Blue Ribbon.
That’s the problem with mass entertainment. No single artist or piece of art is likely to appeal to every single person in the world, so no single performance is likely to appeal to every single person watching the Super Bowl.
Some people loved Prince’s awesome Foo Fighters cover a few years ago; others hated the performance. When thousands are watching the same concert, whether they really want to watch it or not, there are bound to be thousands of people who end up disappointed.
This Sunday, members of the Black Eyed Peas have the chance to represent the younger generation and prove that their group is at least somewhat entertaining and appealing on a global level. This is the Super Bowl, after all, not necessarily highbrow entertainment.
If they fail, oh well. We can only hope that Fergie has some sort of wardrobe malfunction.

The worst half time show I have ever watched.
It was such a joke. I cant wait for these idiots to stop making “music” and ruining classic songs. Worst performance ever, and I’m sure they suck that much at all of their performances.
How can this article list PRINCE with the Rolling Stones, The Who and Bruce Springsteen?????? Prince performed an incredible half-time show ending with his biggest hit Purple Rain, which topped any other half-time performance I’ve seen in years!!!! Prince should be compared with Michael Jackson as a great performer and not lumped in with those other ho-hum, “safe” and boring acts!!!!!
i never watched the other halftime shows but this one i will watch bc bep is my favorite group.. it will be a great halftime show
Michael Jackson is the ONLY PERFORMER who BY SHEER GENIUS appealed to EVERYONE. No matter who they select, they will never be able to fill Michael’s shoes nor top his performance in 1993.And in the words of Forrest Gump, “That’s all I got to say about that”.
“Michael Jackson was arguably the first extremely popular, A-list pop star to play the Super Bowl halftime show,”  no arguement there. It’s a fact! As for the black eyed peas. I’ll pass.

To be, or not to be.
That was the question Hamlet famously pondered in Shakespeare’s renowned play. But the question discussed Monday night at Bovard Auditorium, during a staged trial held by the Shakespeare Center of Los Angeles, skipped past the philosophical questions to the legal: Can Hamlet be held criminally responsible for the murder of Polonius?
Passing judgement  · The trial attempted to place the story of Hamlet in a contemporary setting and also features appearances from Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, other lawyers and Helen Hunt. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
Literary critics, Shakespearean actors, psychoanalysts and high school English teachers have all passionately fought for their own personal interpretation of Hamlet’s possible insanity.
Imagine Prince Hamlet did not die that fateful day by Laertes’ poisoned sword.
Imagine, instead, that he recovered consciousness and now, more than 400 years later, he is finally granted a fair trial to determine whether he ought to be executed for murdering Polonius.
In other words, Law & Order meets Shakespeare.
Danette Meyers and Nathan Hochman from the Los Angeles County Bar Association took the floor and called psychiatrist Ronald Markman as their expert witness.
The case garnered so much attention that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed to adjudicate the trial. And it all happened live, right here in Los Angeles.
Hosted by USC’s Gould School of Law, and co-sponsored by SCLA and both council teams’ associations, the trial was very much a local one. Jurors were all Los Angeles residents, from actors Helen Hunt and Tom Irwin to USC students Rose Leisner, a junior majoring in Theatre and Tim McNally, a senior majoring in International Relations.
Hamlet pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and he somehow procured Beverly Hills Bar Association members Blair Berk and Richard Hirsch as his lawyers, who convinced forensic psychiatrist Saul Faerstein to testify in Hamlet’s defense.
The central argument during the three-hour-long trial was not whether or not Hamlet committed murder, but if he was truly insane and thus not criminally responsible for Polonius’s murder.
Although it was a mock trial, the logic and rhetoric both sides of the council brought before the jury was smart, thorough and professional.
“Hamlet is divided from himself and good judgment by the disease of the mind,” Berk argued, pointing to the instance when Hamlet blindly stabs at the curtain and then has a “delusional” chat with his dead father.

“Hamlet needs Prozac rather than jail,” Hirsch declared in his closing statement.
Meanwhile, Meyers argued that Hamlet’s decision not to kill Claudius while he was praying, in hopes of preventing his uncle from going to heaven, was a “brilliant, calculating, rational and logical play.”
His decision not to strike at that moment was a form of control, Meyers continued, an action that requires careful thought.
“Hamlet’s plea for insanity is just a ploy to paint himself as a person to be pitied, rather than a foe to be feared,” Hochman concluded. “Ruling Hamlet as sane is the only sane thing to do.”
But during the testimonies, defense witness Faerstein alluded to Hamlet’s soliloquies to show that Hamlet was experiencing severe grief, indecisiveness and worthlessness — symptoms listed for mental disorders.
Meanwhile, Markman argued that “scholars would not spend so much time studying [Hamlet’s soliloquies] if they were by a raving maniac.”
The high point of the trial was the witness testimonies. Both Faerstein and Markman enlivened the stage with their banter, while presenting interesting thoughts and analysis.
When asked why he thought Hamlet suffered weight gain, one of the symptoms of mental disorders, Faerstein quoted mournfully, “Oh that this too, too solid flesh melt!”
Markman had his own share of laughs as well, when he suggested solemnly that the reason Gertrude could not see the ghost might not be that Hamlet was delusional, but that perhaps the ghost didn’t want Gertrude to see him.
After the council’s closing arguments, the jury’s deliberations were aired live through a closed circuit television, a rare chance for the lawyers to get an inside peek into how their arguments affected the jury’s decision.
Despite the jury  ruling Hamlet guilty, instead of reaching a conclusion the trial only left the question of Hamlet’s ‘to be sane or not to be sane’ debate hotter than ever.
Correction 2/15/2011: An earlier version of this story listed Ronald Markman as “Ronald Richman” on several occasions. This version has been edited to reflect his correct name. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
The problem of the killing of Pelonius adds a confusion to the play. Since Hamlet dies at the end,
commentators have seen that killing as the reason Hamlet merited to die in the end — the sentence
meted out by the just God that Shakespeare and his audience believed was the setting. 
In fact, there is in the play an action of Hamlet that does indeed merit his punishment. This is overlooked
because everyone focuses on the killing of Pelonius. A more diligent examination of the play reveals
this capital crime, which some commentators have actually found and reported.
The play is a parable and enacts the fact that this is a world in which accident and chance plays a part.
The central aspect of the play is character and the consequences of character. Hamlet is over righteous
— a grievous character fault — and this leads to the tragic death of this good man — a parable for all of us
“good men” to contemplate in our own actions
in our own lives.
Commentators forget that Hamlet was involved in seeking to punish his step father for the murder of
his own father and believed that, as the son and heir to the throne, he had the right to mete out such
punishment. Through the play within a play, Hamlet believed he had established the guilt of Claudius
by his demeanor in reaction to the play that reenacted the murder. (Horatio backed up that judgement
in his own witness to Claudius’s reaction.) Hamlet had been looking for an occasion to find Claudius
in an unworthy act — spying on Hamlet and endangering Hamlet — so that he could be dispatched
without heavenly mercy in the after life. 
In sum, Hamlet had meant to kill Claudius but, in his zeal, failed to go the extra mile of
caution, and ended up killing bystander Pelonius, the latter’s own contributary negligence
playing a part, even if in ignorance. 
The killing was a mistake, a kind of negligence, but understandable in the emotionally charged
situation that Hamlet faced. I think Hamlet, had he been tried, would have been found guilty of a
lesser crime than murder and would have been punished with probation and set up as the
rightful King of Denmark.
I found Sophia Lee’s article on the trial of Hamlet clever and entertaining.  However she appears to have identified me both as ‘Markman’ and then ‘Richman’ towards the end of the article when she quoted statements that I made during my testimony.  Hope this was just a typo, as I don’t recall anyone by the name of Richman in the cast.
Ronald Markman, M.D.
[…] when one of the guys mentioned that he had gone to the Hamlet trial. Google Reader pointed me to a post about the trial, and I realized that this was a real thing. Apparently the trial was held at the University of […]

We admire athletes for their physical prowess and their ability to contort themselves and perform feats we previously thought unimaginable.
Many people, from young boys  and girls to grown adults alike, place athletes on a pedestal, forcing them to become role models.
None of us distant observers of the game actually know the moral character of these athletes.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
When accounts of bad behavior are reported, fans are first shocked and indignant.
The athlete engages in damage control. The public relations firm gets to work and the player’s image starts to be revamped.
Gradually, we accept the athlete’s triumphant story that he has indeed changed, and then we root for him again.
Consider Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods, Ben Roethlisberger and Michael Vick.
All of these athletes did something immoral that the general public doesn’t approve of. Fortunately for the athletes, fans have amnesia.
All of the athletes’ problems are fixed by doing one simple thing: winning.
Roethlisberger, the Steelers quarterback accused of rape and sexual assault this summer, was a pariah. He served a four-game suspension because of his history with the law, and many women’s rights groups were calling for the Steelers to bench him.
Next Sunday, he’ll be playing in the Super Bowl, America’s most widely watched sporting event.
Although talk has died down about his dropped rape case, the discussion now is whether he can pull off his third championship.
In an April 2010 poll, 68 percent of Steelers fans wanted Roethlisberger suspended and 23 percent wanted him traded.
There is less of a fuss about their alleged rapist quarterback now.
Especially not after he led them through a hard-fought AFC championship game against the tough New York Jets.
And not after he played through a broken nose in a regular season win over the Baltimore Ravens, which ended up securing their first-round bye week.
They are standing by their role model, claiming he’s changed.
Their about-face is completely acceptable. Unless you have some allegiance to the Packers, rooting for Roethlisberger is perfectly fine. It’s not because of the dramatic change in his image and his attempt to charm the media at every turn. The allegiance lies deeper than that.
Fans desperately want the players to be perfect. They aren’t. They are not meant to be idolized for their morals. They should be respected for their athletic ability. And their job is to win games.
Although we might root for them as superstars, we more celebrate the team. That team-first attitude is what sports should be about.
If you’re still hung up about the potential transgressions that Roethlisberger might have committed in Milledgeville, Ga. last summer, don’t be.
The charges were dropped, and Roethlisberger still served a four-game suspension. He sat out an appropriate amount of games because he brought a black mark on the NFL.
His suspension was warranted, but it is unfair to hold a grudge against the man who will make his third Super Bowl appearance this weekend. Many will not ever be able to support Roethlisberger because of those accusations.
But there are things that many athletes do under the table that the public would wholeheartedly disagree with if they found out about them.
Most people have a strong sense of morality and values, athletes included, but sports are not necessarily about values only.
Though values are important in life and sports, most athletes’ legacies are defined by how many championships they win or lose.
Charles Barkley once famously declared, “I am not a role model.” He was, in essence, trying to tell fans to judge him not on his off-the-court behavior, but by the result of the games he played in.
This is a sentiment fans should take to heart.
Winning is the fundamental reason we root for athletes in the first place. There’s no reason to get on our high horse in regard to Roethlisberger.
As fans, we have collectively embraced athletes with flawed pasts once they start to win again.
This time should be no different.

There are currently more than 50 universities in the United States  with gender-neutral housing, an option that allows a student to share a room with a student of the opposite sex. USC, however, is not among these institutions.
The preferences of many transgender, gay and lesbian students get lost in a system that houses students based on their sex.
For a university that prides itself on diversity, it’s shocking that USC has yet to enact some sort of gender-neutral housing policy that can extend options for students.
As college students, we all have assumed the right to choose where to live, how to live and who to live with. USC is a haven for many people with varying sexual orientations, preferences and ideas, and this unique conglomeration of people can’t fit in pre-existing molds. It is the duty of USC to ensure every student enrolled is comfortable.
Trojans for Equality, a club on campus, is drafting a proposal to push for gender-neutral housing. Its request asks for the option to be enacted in the Rainbow Floor,  a special interest residential community at Century Apartments intended for LGBT students and their supportive Allies.
If accepted, the gender-neutral housing would be purely optional, and restricted to only the Rainbow Floor. Trojans for Equality hopes to try to expand this option to the on-campus residential locations in the following years.
This policy, if approved, would accommodate those who have slipped through the cracks of the housing system.
Some fear that gender-neutral housing include would promote promiscuity. Although this concern is valid, it’s important to consider that, at this point in our lives, we have the opportunity to make our own decisions — decisions that shouldn’t be overseen by the administration.

To the Alum, 
Keep your money, keep your judgment, keep your ignorance. You must be talking about the other USC because the trojan family stays together. 
-Tommy Trojan
Very well put Is about time someone speak up for gays  . after all we are all human I love your article ..keep it up
To an Alumnus–
As a transgender student at USC, I find your comment extremely rude and ignorant. You have no idea what it’s like to get weird stares and live with someone who doesn’t support who you have chosen to become. You have no idea what it’s like to live in a society that doesn’t accept who you are. To be able to have ONE place of solace is not childish nor is it an indication of me needing to grow up. 
Take your tax-deductible donations elsewhere. I’d rather pay full tuition than receive financial aid that is comprised of money that you donated.
“It is the duty of USC to ensure every student enrolled is comfortable.”
Really? Their duty? Maybe it’s time for you to grow up. Your university’s duty is to provide you with the tools to succeed in life. Being accommodated at every turn will not help you achieve this. Sometimes life just isn’t fair, and the sooner that you are able to recognize that your obdurate and mulish campaigns are not supported by the people who surround you on more than a superficial level, you will be much better off.
Clearly it’s time to find a new place to make tax-deductible donations to; the students here are not what they used to be.
Let me provide a historical example to reveal both the lack of consideration and ignorance of “An Alumnus'” statement…
I am a proud American who believes firmly that this nation was built on the principles of equal opportunity and equality for all. I believe that our institutions, both public and private, should follow these guidelines as set forth by our nation.
Not to get too lofty, but your statement of “Sometimes life just isn’t fair…” reveals a deep ignorance which poisons the minds of many adult and youth across our nation, and inhibits any progress towards achieving social cooperation.
About a half-century ago, Blacks and Whites were still segregated, and despite many Blacks attempts at trying to integrate with their White counterparts, be it in school systems, public places, etc., they were often rebuffed.
Luckily, the days of segregation are no more thanks to social advocacy which included both Blacks, Whites, and other groups who finally realized that the system was flawed. Thus, they mobilized as a unit for a common cause, social equality for all.
I am not trying to parallel the issues of gender neutral housing and racial equality. I am just saying that your comment, “the sooner that you are able to recognize that your obdurate and mulish campaigns are not supported by the people who surround you on more than a superficial level, you will be much better off” reflects these prejudiced comments which stood in the way of achieving social equality.
Your views still stand in the way today.
As “An Alumnus” of USC, you are antiquated in your thinking, and your views do not represent the progressivism that the University champions.
It’s true. We’re not like the old USC student body. We’re better. We’re progressive and tolerant, and we’re much more diverse. It’s no surprise why the academic ranks are much higher, the standards to get accepted are significantly better, the recent alumni are doing well, more people want to go to USC, etc.
I think we NEED at least one housing area that offers gender-neutral options. I get why there is opposition to the idea (people will have sex), but people will have sex regardless. If this decision will help students feel more comfortable, why not make this move? 
And what’s it to you (An Alumnus) anyway? It’s like you’re working hard to make sure people AREN’T happy.
Dear Alumnus,
YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE TROJAN FAMILY. Keep your money.
-A current student

Jalen Grimble (Las Vegas), who is rated as the No. 7 defensive tackle in the nation by Scout.com, has withdrawn his verbal commitment to play for USC, according to the Las Vegas Sun.
The 6-foot-4, 255-pound defensive lineman from Bishop Gorman High School verbally committed to USC in May, but is no longer being recruited by the school, according to the report.
According to a press release from his high school promoting the school’s signing day event, Grimble will choose to play for either Miami (Fl.) or UCLA on Wednesday. Rivals.com also lists Nebraska as a possible destination for the highest-rated recruit from Nevada.
Verbal commitments, such as the one Grimble gave to USC in May, are non-binding. Commitments only become official when an athlete signs his letter of intent.

If you are not planning on attending President Nikias’s address to the students today, consider heading on over to the Fishbowl Chapel at the University Religious Center from 4 until 7 pm. There, Carl Wilkins, the only American witness in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, will be sharing his experiences. The founder of World Outside My Shoes and former head of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency in Rwanda, Wilkins has traveled across the country to inform people of the atrocities committed during the genocide and how he helped prevent the massacre of hundreds of children.
World Outside My Shoes is a nonprofit organization committed to motivating and equipping people to stand up against genocide or any other form of intolerance. An ideal leader of this organization, Carl Wilkins is truly influential.
“[He’s] a true hero. His quiet courage has inspired me and will inspire anyone who hears his story. I wish every young person — indeed, every person — in America could meet Carl,” said Jerry Fowler, president of Save Darfur. “He is such a powerful inspiration that I can’t think of anything that would contribute more to making our world a better place.”

Four-star wide receiver/tight end Junior Pomee (Moreno Valley, Calif.) has committed to USC, according to Lya Wodraska of the Salt Lake Tribune.
Pomee gave a verbal commitment to the Trojans just days after visiting the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
“We are glad to finally get it over with,” his father, Kapelieli, told Wodraska Monday night. “Mainly he wanted to stay close to his family.”
Pomee’s decision could likely result in three-star cornerback Ryan Henderson (Moreno Valley, Calif.) signing with USC on National Signing Day, as well. Henderson, a long-time Utah commit and teammate of Polee, had recently said he was split “50-50” between the Utes and Trojans.
Many have speculated, however, that if Polee signs with USC, Henderson will quickly follow suit.

While one highly-ranked USC commit, De’Anthony Thomas (Los Angeles) is unsure whether he’ll sign with the Trojans on National Signing Day Wednesday, it appears as if four-star wide receiver Victor Blackwell (Santa Ana, Calif.) remains firm in his verbal commitment to USC, according to the Orange County Register.
Mater Dei High coach Bruce Rollinson told OCVarsity.com Tuesday that Blackwell would indeed sign with USC on Wednesday.
“Most definitely,” Rollinson said.
Because of a medical appointment, however, Blackwell will be unable to attend Mater Dei’s signing day ceremony, the Register said.

Four-star cornerback Marcus Roberson (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) will sign a letter of intent Wednesday to play college football at either Florida or USC, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.
Roberson recently committed to Auburn Monday, but withdrew his verbal commitment approximately 24 hours after, marking the second time the St. Thomas Aquinas High cornerback had rescinded a commitment.
Prior to committing to Auburn on Friday, Roberson had committed to Texas Tech on Jan. 18 just days after visiting USC.
“I’m trying to do what’s best for me,” Roberson told the Sun-Sentinel. “The decision with Auburn was between me and the coaches there.”
Due to the departure of senior Shareece Wright and the team’s overall lack of depth in the secondary, it’s feasible Roberson could potentially start as a true freshman for the Trojans alongside sophomore-to-be Nickell Robey, who did as much in 2010.

Orange County ska-punk band Reel Big Fish has just embarked on its 2011 world tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary. However, they are doing so without one of its most beloved members, Scott Klopfenstein.
In addition to his musical contributions, Klopfenstein was a major player in the signature humor of Reel Big Fish live shows. He and lead guitarist/vocalist Aaron Barrett would banter back and forth between songs, feeding off of each other in a successful effort to keep audience members laughing in between their bouts of dancing.

Klopfenstein’s official announcement was both heartfelt and endearing, as he declared to fans that he was not leaving out of bad blood with the other members. Instead, he is retiring because his wife recently became pregnant, and he wants to remain home with her in Brooklyn to help raise their daughter.
Klopfenstein lovingly concluded his message saying to the fans “Your love and support have always been the fuel that make Reel Big Fish continue to move forward. And when I tell my daughter stories of my time in the band, I will probably become misty eyed, like I am now, when I remember all of your beautiful faces. Please take care of yourselves and those around you. And remember, don’t let your dreams stand waiting in the wings. Invite them center stage. They need to be seen.”
Reel Big Fish recently played two shows in Anaheim, Calif. and Agoura Hills, Calif. without Klopfenstein. Replacing him was Matt Appleton on saxophone and background vocals from the band Goldfinger. While the shows were certainly enjoyable and fun, the banter between Barrett and Klopfenstein was undoubtedly missed.
Even with this great loss, though, Reel Big Fish will surely still inject a tremendous amount of energy into its live shows and keep fans firmly its grasp.

USC has obtained a campus-wide license that grants free access for all current university students, faculty and staff to Lynda.com, a website that offers more than 900 training videos on a broad range of web programs and computing topics.
Programs · Aditya Thingle, a graduate student studying computer science, and Courtney Churukian, a staff member, work at the KOH lab. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
Some of the instructional videos on Lynda.com include programs for web development, social media sites, video and audio production, Google applications and Microsoft Office.
Among the offerings, Lynda.com offers a tutorial on Microsoft Word 2010 that teaches one how to mail merge documents to save time.
The courses are divided into five to 15 minute tutorials, and topics can be searched by subject or software on the website. Students who use Avid to edit film footage can utilize these tutorials to learn the essentials on importing and exporting footage along with many other shortcuts.
Kevin Durkin, the director of communications for ITS, said the idea came from an advisory group called the Strategic Technology Forum, which is composed of IT leaders from the university.
“In this forum, the discussion came up from a desire to have something to do with self-training,” Durkin said. “A subcommittee was formed in partnership with STF, and the university eventually got a campus-wide license.”
Tiffany Lee, a junior majoring in communication, sais this website will be a useful tool, especially for students in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
“Annenberg students often have to familiarize themselves with up-and-coming types of technology and media, so it will be very beneficial for students to learn how to use these various technologies extensively,” Lee said.
Professors at the university have also expressed interest in using Lynda.com to further hone their technological skills, according to Durkin.
“Industry standards change so quickly in our field that an instructor who isn’t actively practicing can easily fall behind,” said Haven Lin-Kirk, area head of design at the Roski School of Fine Arts. “With everyone’s busy schedules, it’s much more convenient to update your skills in your free time.”
Lin-Kirk also said she plans to integrate the program into Roski’s curriculum.
Click here to go to http://www.usc.edu/its/lynda, then go to "Log in to Lynda.com" and enter your USC username and password.
“The FA203 Digital Tools for Design Course will use Lynda.com as a supplement to the curriculum that is already in place,” Lin-Kirk said. “Though it will not replace any of the existing lectures or in-class materials, there is also quite a bit that is available through the service that is not covered in our courses.”
Lexie Cook, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism, said she thinks having access to this site could help give students an edge in the job search, as well.
“Companies look for college graduates who are proficient in many different computer programs, so the more programs students can learn while they’re in school, the better their resume will be,” Cook said.
ITS plans to provide free access to Lynda.com for six months, and then the Strategic Technology Forum will evaluate the program’s effectiveness and popularity with the campus community to see if it will be continued.
The website can be accessed at any time, and students or faculty need only to log in at http://www.usc.edu/its/lynda by using their USC e-mail account.
As the Senior Director of Education at lynda.com, just want to congratulate all of you at USC for the successful campus-wide launch of lynda.com.

President C. L. Max Nikias will speak to undergraduate and graduate students in an address today at 4 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium, marking USC’s first presidential address to students.
In past years, university presidents have given similar speeches, called the Annual Address to the Faculty, to the administration, faculty and staff about the state of the university and the president’s yearly goals.
This year, however, Undergraduate Student Government President Chris Cheng worked with Nikias to create an address aimed specifically toward students.
According to Carl Marziali, assistant vice president for USC Media Relations, the speech will be oriented toward community service.
President Nikias is expected to offer insight into the future direction of USC and address his hope for students to play an increasingly important role in helping the university connect with its surrounding community and city, he said.
Students said there are certain issues that they hope are at the forefront of the university’s vision.
Shannon Caudill, a freshman majoring in kinesiology, said environmental sustainability was a critical issue for the university.
“An important topic right now is how USC should be putting more effort into going green and improving our sustainability,” Caudill said.
Karen Romero, a freshman majoring in business administration major, said she expects the president to address safety in his address.
“President Nikias recently sent out an e-mail to students about safety on and off campus,” she said. “So, his speech could be addressing that.”
President Nikias will address students at 4 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium.
