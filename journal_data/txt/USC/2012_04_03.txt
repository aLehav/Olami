Artists, musicians and poets who die young from mental illnesses are ubiquitous. An important one to note is artist Vincent Van Gogh.
Van Gogh was born 153 years ago on March 30,1853. After ten years as an active artist, he died in 1890 at the tender age of 37.
Nonetheless his contributions subsist today, stirring many platforms of creativity including fashion, technology, science and popular culture.
There is an apparent fixation among authors to unearth more of his mystic life. The large number of biographies depicting the artist’s life is a testament to his popularity among historians and other academics.
Released last October, the book Van Gogh: The Life runs at approximately 1,000 pages. It is a marathon of a book written by Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and Harvard law-school alumni Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Published in 2010, it is the most recent biography of the artist up to date. In particular, it “diligently examines the development of his ideas, his techniques, his startling ability to inhale lessons from other painters and transform their innovations into his own.” (As described in Michiko Kakutani’s New York Times’ review.) An example of this has emerged in the world of fashion.
Globally acclaimed high-fashion brand Rodarte has taken heed of Van Gogh’s characteristic design patterns. Last fall, the brand introduced a line inspired by paintings like Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers and “Starry Night”; bringing to the runway a Vincent Van Gogh Inspired Collection.
In addition to the aforementioned authors who penned Van Gogh: The Life and designer Rodarte, other professionals have displayed interest and commitment in studying Van Gogh, particularly in the field of psychiatry and psychology. Many wish to infer their own conclusions based on signs and symptoms they detect in Van Gogh’s autobiographical archives.
Housed in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, numerous letters and artwork help health professionals deduce accurate conclusions about Van Gogh—specifically his mind’s biology and consequent mental illness.
After decades of study, researchers relate the artist’s behavior, personality traits and volatile ways to the bi-polar mental illness. (Bi-polar, occasionally referred to as manic-depressive disorder, causes mood swings that alternate between manic and depressive behavior.)
Since Van Gogh committed suicide, the number of doctors who have attempted to dissect his psyche is mind-boggling. More than 150 physicians have reviewed and discussed the perplexing diagnoses of Van Gogh’s illness, according to the American Psychiatric Association in 2003—one can only assume the numbers have risen since then.
The plethora of recent biographies proves the artist continues to gain notoriety, especially since most things written about Van Gogh reflect his genius and flawed character, and investigates whether any dots between his insanity and virtuoso connect. The heightened intrigue that propels on-going studies has undoubtedly contributed to the rise of public awareness on the subject.
Clinical psychologist and author Kay Redfield of Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament clarifies the artist’s manic state, a polar extreme of manic-depressive disorder:
“Many of the changes in mood, thinking and perception that characterize the mildly manic states – restlessness, ebullience, expansiveness, irritability, grandiosity, quickened and more finely tuned senses, intensity of emotional experiences, diversity of thought, and rapidity of associational processes – are highly characteristic of creative thought as well.” (105)
As the book reveals a coherent connection between bi-polar disorder and Van Gogh’s  creative-genetic makeup, one can infer that the artist’s sickness drove him to insanity, serving as the dominant fuel for his creativity. Other departed bi-polar individuals followed similar emotional blueprints and too, contained high capacities for talent.
(The opening statements of the Fall 2004 Setting New Standards in Mental Health Edition, From Napoleon to Kurt Cobain: Cultural Legends with Bipolar Disorder) reads:
“From poetry to politics, religion to science, some of the world’s most famous artists, leaders, and innovators have had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness.”
The study then compares Vincent van Gogh to writers F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nirvana-band rock star Kurt Cobain, leaders Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, and Academy-Award winning actress Vivien Leigh, who played the “emotionally troubled” Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind, to name a few.
“As these examples show, many people with bipolar disorder and related mood disorders exhibit exceptional discipline and can harness their illness to accomplish legendary feats.” “Individuals with manic-depression and other mental disorders surround us, coming from all walks of life and sometimes among them are those who play the most celebrated roles in shaping our society.”
Author Joshua Wolf Shenk says in his book Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness that those with a mental illness “are very much in touch with the pain of life and if they are able to tolerate their experience, they can become examples to other people of how to live in the face of pain with dignity, and how to search for meaning—which ultimately is what everyone is searching for: a meaningful life.”
The Lincoln biography draws similar characteristics to Van Gogh’s mental disease, idiosyncrasies and nervous dispositions.
In addition to the aforementioned individuals who have researched and analyzed the bi-polar disorder, fictional characters have also captured the world’s attention both on the television screen and silver screen; movies and television shows convey the scientific truth to the masses: those that suffer with psychological disorders may still have the ability to possess an imagination of their own.
Main character Carrie in Showtime’s hit show Homeland struggles with both her CIA identity and unparalleled mastermind. Constantly unsure whether her intuitions and consequent actions straddle between genius and psychotic, Carrie leaves the audience ambivalent whether it is her nature or her nurture she questions— am I reading the bad guy’s mind, or am I simply raving mad, seconds away from losing my job? Completely aware of her bi-polar disorder, she uses it to her advantage as she manically works to solve the international manhunt mystery throughout season one.
For a lighter crowd, the adolescent show 90210 airs on the CW and introduces teenagers to Silver, a flawed NYU-bound artiste with lots of punch, vigor and thick enough skin to tolerate the pain and trauma resulting from her bi-polar illness. Conversely good–natured on the interior, she faces her demons from her childhood. Although she moves to the beat of her own drum, her subconscious disrupts her go-lucky flow sporadically. Similar to most bi-polar individuals who are coping with the effects of parental abandonment, Silver resists her alcoholic mother’s neglect; she leaves home and seeks refuge at a local shelter, where she is eventually kicked to the curb and replaced by others with higher degrees of need. She then settles for sleeping in cars—until her older sister and friends step in.
Switching gears to the real deal, well-renowned actress Catherine Zeta-Jones spoke outwardly about her bi-polar mental disorder last March, and shortly after, 19-year-old musician Demi Lovato followed Zeta-Jones’ footsteps.
Lovato went to rehab in 2010 to receive treatment for bipolar, which consequently led to an eating disorder as well—a common side effect for those who suffer with the illness.
“I was a very manipulative person when it came to my eating disorder,” Demi says in an interview with Bliss Magazine. “You name it, I did it.”
In conclusion, it is fair to say that Van Gogh and others have played a significant role in killing today’s stigma of the bi-polar mental illness. Van Gogh’s legacy continues to live on, as others have followed suit in educating the masses about mental health.
Thank you Van Gogh; your work is priceless, a value of untold sums. May your essence continue to inspire us all and continue to galvanize worldwide awareness to mental health.

I do not appreicate an editor allowing a “stimga.”
A pledge for you:
You may not direct a “stigma” against any member of my family, any employee
of my paper, any acquaintance or fellow through my paper.
You may not use my newspaper (journal, radio station, TV station, website,
my individual self) as a resource for promoting a “stigma.”
I will not accept a paid advertisement promoting a “stigma,” nor an article.
Proactively, editors, one can take a stand against promoting a prejudice, a stand against those who do so, willfully, maliciously or naively. Or as empty habit.
Harold A. Maio, retired mental health editor

The Keck Hospital of USC and the National Union of Healthcare Workers reached a tentative agreement Tuesday for a three-year contract that, if ratified, will remain in effect until April 2015. NUHW members will vote to ratify the deal next week.

The tentative agreement includes salary raises between 9.75 and 33 percent over the course of the contract, full employer-based health care insurance and paid time off, according to an NUHW press release.
“This agreement features a generous compensation and benefits package that includes salary increases upon contract ratification and again in 2013 and 2014,” said Scott Evans, interim hospital CEO and COO, in a press release. “It serves the best interests of all Keck Hospital of USC employees while maintaining our competitive position in the increasingly competitive health care marketplace.”
In an effort to secure a suitable contract, hospital employees participated in an informational picket and a 24-hour strike in October 2011. Additionally, caregivers signed off on the authorization of a second strike, if necessary.
The caregivers, who were formally represented by another union, have been negotiating a first contract with NUHW since August 2010.
During the negotiation process, the hospital sought concessions, such as repealing a ban on subcontracting and replacing seniority-based pay with merit-based pay, according to an NUHW press release.
“This agreement is proof positive that when workers stay united and stand up for ourselves, we can win a fair contract with raises and no takeaways,” said Julio Estrada, a respiratory therapist at USC, in the press release. “We don’t have to give up our benefits just because the employer says so. NUHW is a fighting union, and that’s why we won.”
This is a victory for workers and their families. It is also a victory for the Trojan family. Now Keck Hospital can concentrate on being the world class hospital it is supposed to be. Fight On.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary from Tuesday, April 3.
View Roundup 04-05 in a larger map
Crimes against property
At 2:55 p.m., a student in Troy Hall reported that she discovered her USC ID missing and subsequently learned that a suspect had used it to make multiple unauthorized purchases on her discretionary account.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 7:02 p.m., DPS officers contacted a student who was observed driving a vehicle near 29th and Orchard streets that appeared to have been recently damaged, and he informed them that he had just been involved in a traffic collision with a staff member. The student was not injured and he stated that LAPD officers had assisted him and the staff member in exchanging information prior to the DPS officers contacting him.
at 4:43 p.m., a student reported that she mistakenly gave a Soto Street Building access card to an unidentified non-USC female who was not authorized to use it and the subject did not return it after leaving the premises. A staff member subsequently requested that the card be deactivated for security purposes.
At 11:29 a.m., a staff member reported that a large poster and an envelope containing a letter from a student organization had been placed on President C. L. Max Nikias’ vehicle while it was parked in Parking Lot 5.
at 11:29 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect loitering outside a classroom at May Ormerod Harris Hall and detained him for investigation. The suspect was arrested for trespassing and, after being transported to SW station, he was found in possession of a phone that he claimed to have purchased out of state. The officers subsequently determined that the phone belonged to a student. When they contacted the student he stated that it was taken from his residence without permission. The suspect was booked for receiving stolen property.

U.S. Attorney André Birotte discussed the role the Department of Justice plays in helping prevent crime in Los Angeles at Protecting Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in 21st Century Los Angeles, an event sponsored by Price School of Public Policy, on Tuesday.
“To really serve the community, we must engage and listen to learn what are their needs, issues and concerns,” Birotte said.
Birotte serves as the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California. With more than 18 million people, the district is the nation’s most populous. The district spans Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and 35 of the cities within the district have populations more than 100,000 people.
Birotte said the Central District of California is the most diverse in the nation and his priority is to serve the community he represents.
“Near and dear to my heart is protecting civil rights and liberties,” Birotte said. “Only 265 of us [at the office] are responsible for the entire district, so I need to prioritize. But I make sure these priorities are in line with our communities.”
Birotte said Martin Luther King Jr.’s quote, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice,” inspires his daily work.
Birotte said President Barack Obama cited the same quote four years ago on April 4, while commemorating the 40th anniversary of King’s death, but Obama added, “it does not bend on its own. It bends because each of us … bend[s] it in the direction of justice.”
“This was Obama’s call to action for our nation,” Birotte said. “When I use these words, I see it as a call to action here in Los Angeles.”
Birotte said three specific challenges that need to bend toward the “arc of justice” are policy and practicing of constitutional policing, constitutional policing of our jails and constitutional issues of housing and fair lending.
“No other police department is more committed than the [Los Angeles Police Department],” Birotte said. “There is no excuse to break the law in order to enforce the law. … As with the Occupy movement, I am proud that our city’s response was a success, contrasted with others. I see how far [LAPD] has come, and it became this way because of many people in this community.”
Earlier this year, Birotte’s federal law enforcement team and the Los Angeles Police Department teamed up in what was their most massive single-day accomplishment of the year, a takedown of more than 90 gang members.
“This is what we call synergy,” Birotte said. “The results speak for themselves.”
Birotte said though his department has been successful in increasing crime prosecution in Los Angeles, its work is not finished.
“Our work here is never truly finished if our goal is a society which all persons are treated fairly and equally under the law,” Birotte said. “We of the federal government will continue to work in harmony with the state, county and locals in both public and private sectors.”
Birotte said the community must stay engaged in this public policy debate.
“We can continue to bend that universal moral arc,” Birotte said.

Zack Jerome, founder and writer of the Lost Angeles Blog, discussed the evolution of social media and blogs at the Director’s Forum, sponsored by the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, on Tuesday.
Jerome said he started his blog, which features stories and satire on USC and Los Angeles, three years ago when he noticed the comments he received on his Facebook notes came from people he was not expecting.
Social media · Zack Jerome, founder and writer of Lost Angeles Blog, advised students to be a part of the story when blogging, at the Director’s Forum on Tuesday. - Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Jerome said it is important to find your own voice and said his audience dictates what he writes.
“It’s all about the number of clicks and exposure to your world,” Jerome said. “You get to be a source.”
Jerome said the key to a successful blog is creating captivating content and driving traffic to your blog.
“Dive in, set a schedule and train people to see it as a media outlet,” Jerome said. “What is it about something you write that draws people to it will help develop your voice.”
As a self-proclaimed believer in Gonzo journalism, a style of journalism that does not claim objectivity, Jerome supports outlets for the reporter to be part of the story, which allows him to write freely.
“What won’t go away is the human need to connect,” Jerome said. “It’s a gift to have writers people want to read.”
With his background in blogging and advertising, Jerome said he discourages bloggers from seeking sponsored posts.
“The more people are viewing your content the more likely you are to get sued,” Jerome said. “I’m not a huge fan of sponsored posts. Transparency is key.”
Kim Borowski, a senior majoring in business administration, said she found Jerome’s advice about advertisements and sponsored posts helpful.
“It was interesting to hear about the changing social media landscape and to learn about the professional side of it because we all already use it,” Borowski said.

To better serve the needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community on college campuses, some California state universities are considering putting an optional question on college applications that asks students about their sexual orientation.
USC currently does not plan to include the question on its application form, said Timothy Brunold, dean of admission.
“Part of the fear [for including it] is that for many students who are going through this process, their parents, for example, don’t even know that their son or daughter has a particular identity,” Brunold said. “One of the last things we would want to do would be to ask that student about it specifically, in fear that that student might not be ready to share his or her identity with someone who might be looking at their application.”
Brunold said USC uses the pre-orientation homework to gather that information. On the homework, students can indicate whether or not they want more information on a particular department, such as the LGBT Resource Center.
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said the pre-orientation homework has successfully helped his center identify the need of USC’s LGBT students.
“That formula tends to be working for us so far,” Vigil said. “It’s not so much that everyone who fills out the pre-orientation homework identifies as LGBT, they can also be an ally, someone involved in gay rights high school who wants to continue their involvement.”
Vigil said the idea of putting a voluntary question about sexual orientation on USC’s application could have positive and negative results. Though including the question would give the university another starting point for recognizing the number of students who identify with the LGBT community, Vigil said the question itself is inherently problematic.
“In terms of sexual identity, you’re talking about someone’s development,” Vigil said. “For students, the developmental process happens throughout their entire four years here at college. I could get a number of students entering that identify as LGBT but that number may or may not be accurate when thinking about the senior class that leaves.”
Maggie Carroll, a senior majoring in gender studies and comparative literature, said including a question about an applicant’s sexual orientation on college applications could be beneficial.
“It’s hard to figure out what students need without knowing who they are,” Carroll said.
Carroll said that asking a question solely about sexual orientation might also be limiting.
“The queer community spans beyond sexual orientation,” Carroll said. “There’s a growing number of students who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming in some way.”
Bhavan Desai, a sophomore majoring in political science, said he disagrees with putting a voluntary question about sexual orientation on USC’s college application.
“Even if it’s optional, I don’t think the admissions committee has the right to ask if someone’s LGBT,” Desai said. “It doesn’t respect that person’s privacy, and if someone is LGBT, they might feel pressured to check that box.”
Though there are places on the application where an applicant can include their sexual identity if they want to disclose that information optionally, such as the personal statement, filling in a circle on an application is problematic, Desai said.
“With sexual orientation it can change from time to time,” Desai said. “You’re straight, but then realize you’re gay, or bisexual, so creating a box where you check your sexual orientation isn’t the same as when you check a box which identifies you as being white or Hispanic,” Desai said.
Pavitra Krishnamani, a sophomore majoring in psychology, said the box is not a perfect idea, but anything that helps the school to meet students’ needs is good.
“It’s a good idea that the school at least gets a feel for the population coming in so it can allocate resources beforehand,” Krishnamani said. “That doesn’t mean they’ll get everyone, but having an optional box can’t hurt. I don’t see much of a downside as long as the school doesn’t go solely off that information.”
Vigil said USC plans to look at peer institutions that are including an optional question about sexual orientation on their application before the university considers whether to put the question on USC’s application.
As long as there is a heterosexual box to check as well I am fine with it.  People need to know I’m straight!
WHAT’S THERE TO BE ASHAMED OF?
PLENTY.
WHAT’S THERE TO BE PROUD OF?
NOTHING.
EXCEPT THAT YOU FINALLY “GOT EVEN” WITH YOUR PARENTS BY TELLING THEM
NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING FROM YOU, NO GRAND~KIDS, NO RESPECT, NO NOTHING.
DIDN’T THAT FEEL GREAT TO TELL THEM OFF? TO GET SUPPORT FROM YOUR “FRIENDS”?
YOU’VE CHOSEN THE SELF~ISH LIFE WHERE ONLY  Y O U  MATTER.  HOW PATHETIC.
HOW MEAN. HOW MANY HEARTS HAVE YOU TORN TO SHREDS? DOES IT MATTER?
I like the way USC’s LGBT Resource Center uses the pre-orientation homework to assess need for supportive services, since it includes Allies.  Unfortunately, many students may be too afraid or uncertain about their identity to answer a sexual orientation identity question accurately.  At state university’s that ask for identity, a small number may indicate a large need for supportive services.
Please sign this petition and help us advocate to administration for a bigger space where LGBTQ students can feel safe and comfortable. Takes less than a minute!

USC’s system of asking these questions after students are admitted seems to be working well. I would not have come here (or, indeed, gone to any university) if there were a question of that personal sort on the application.

Undergraduate Student Government President Mikey Geragos and Vice President Vinnie Prasad were sworn in at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
New term · Mikey Geragos was sworn in as Undergraduate Student Government president at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
Twelve senators were also sworn in at the meeting. Sophomores Ryan Park, Matthew Arkfeld and Alexander Cascante are the new Greek senators; junior Josh DeMilta, sophomore Maheen Sahoo and freshmen Jasmine McAllister, Emma Katz, Sona Shah and Sarah Loh are residential senators; and juniors Adam Prohoroff, Vicken Antounian and Ani Tatintsyan are commuter senators.
Before the students were sworn in by USG Chief Justice Alex Fadil, Logan Lachman made her final announcement as USG vice president.
“I just want to thank you all for a great year. I will remember every moment of it,” Lachman said. “Good luck to Mikey and Vinnie and USG.”
Once sworn in, Prasad led his first Senate meeting of the year. Prasad said one of his main goals as vice president is to make USG projects and the Senate more transparent to students.
“In the future, when we’re discussing a big topic, like smoking or bikes, I want to have it in the Admissions Center and have students who care about that issue show up,” Prasad said. Senate meetings are open to the entire student body and I want to make that more apparent.”
Monish Tyagi also gave his final address as USG president at the meeting.
“It has been a joy and a privilege to serve as USG president this year,” Tyagi said. “It makes me incredibly proud to pass the torch to one of my best friends.”
Tyagi said he has high hopes for the new administration. He advised all new officers to keep their energy levels high throughout their term.
In his inaugural address, Geragos thanked Tyagi and Lachman and expressed his intention to work tirelessly to create change during his time in office.
“We have many things to fix, and most of the issues that we will face will not be solved in our first semester, nor will they be solved by the end of our administration,” Geragos said. “They will possibly go with this university as long as it is functioning. But that shouldn’t stop us from trying.”
Chief of Staff Kameron Burk also announced the appointed executive cabinet at the meeting.
Geragos said he was excited to officially announce his executive cabinet positions, for which 95 applicants were interviewed. He also said he is eager to begin his work as USG president.
“[I learned] how USG works on a day-to-day basis. Being a director and a senator in years past, you don’t understand the planning and the overall communication,” Geragos said. “What a lot of people will see differently this year is that we will be doing a lot more collaboration with the departments in USG. We’re going to pool our resources and be more effective.”

Hope Geragos steps it up. He can always call his Uncle Mark.

For most of the Trojans’ practices this spring, senior quarterback Matt Barkley has been without his top playmakers because of injuries.
Tuesday offered a glimmer of optimism for the Heisman hopeful, thanks to the return of sophomore wide receiver George Farmer and a pair of tight ends — redshirt sophomores Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer. Although the three only partook in limited portions of practice, their improving health was pleasant news for an offensive unit that has struggled at times to establish a passing game this spring.
Injury bug · With injuries depleting the offense, senior quarterback Matt Barkley has had some rough stretches in practice. He said he is still focused, despite not throwing to his most reliable players. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
“Once we get back into the swing of things — it’s been kind of rough with guys injured, Marqise [Lee] doing track — we’re going to get into a flow,” Barkley said. “[I’m] still teaching the young guys some stuff, but I’m not worried with myself, my game or my decision-making.”
ω
Barkley’s reference to not worrying about his performance thus far comes as a result of an uncharacteristically high number of interceptions during spring practice, an anomaly USC coach Lane Kiffin attributed to his quarterback possibly “getting a little bit bored” as other quarterbacks grab extra reps. Barkley, however, didn’t want to go that far.
“No, I’m not bored at all,” Barkley said. “I’m staying in tune with what we’re doing, staying mentally involved. And when I’m in, it may be a little frustrating at times just because it’s not clicking like you expect it to be, but I just think it’s an opportunity to improve with tough situations.”
ω
Barkley and the rest of the quarterbacks were treated to a couple of extra receiving threats for passing drills — 2009 graduate and current Tennessee Titan Damian Williams, along with 2008 graduate Patrick Turner, who most recently played for the New York Jets. The two were a welcome sight as Farmer, Grimble and Telfer inch toward a return to the field.
“I just saw Damian Williams and Patrick Turner out there and I was loving throwing to them,” Barkley said.
Kiffin was glad to see the former stars as well.
“We’re still down on receivers, which is why we tried to help our quarterbacks out today by bringing out Patrick and Damien, which was good to see,” Kiffin added. “It was another example of Trojan players helping each other out. [It was] good to have those guys out here.”
ω
On the defensive side of the ball, Kiffin was quick to compliment junior safety Demetrius Wright, who he named MVP of Tuesday’s practice.
“Demetrius has really shown flashes throughout the spring,” Kiffin said. “He had a good day today, really dominated special teams drills early on too. He’s becoming more consistent.”
ω
Kiffin was also complimentary of Wright’s new secondary coach, Marvin Sanders, who is charged with the task of re-shaping a unit that finished 101st in the country in passing yards allowed last season.
“The whole secondary is improving,” Kiffin said. “I think that has a lot to do with Marvin being here, and doing a really good job with those guys. And you can see their individual development on and off the field.”
ω
Although the Trojans are improving health-wise, they are still without redshirt freshman tight end Junior Pomee, redshirt freshman running back Buck Allen and junior wide receiver Robert Woods. Pomee, who left practice last Thursday with what appeared to be a serious injury, did not break his right foot as originally feared. The team will be cautious with bringing him back, however, as he missed the entire 2011 season after injuring the same foot.

Between stuffing my face with beignets, listening to jazz music in Jackson Square and making my way through the chaos that is Bourbon Street this past weekend at the Final Four in New Orleans, I thought hard about USC basketball.
For those who have never been, the Final Four is unequivocally the greatest spectacle in sports, professional or college. It’s the biggest party you’ll ever see, mixed with pomp and circumstance, a wild array of school spirit and an atmosphere that sucks you in the moment you arrive at the host city.
Missing the fun · The USC men’s basketball team has never won a national championship and has been to the Final Four twice. Junior guard Greg Allen and the 2012-2013 Trojans hope to bring the program to prominence. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
But even as I crossed another sports adventure off my bucket list, something didn’t feel completely right. It’s hard to argue with an NCAA final pitting two of the nation’s premier basketball factories, Kentucky and Kansas, against each other, but I have to admit, after about the 50th chant of “Let’s Go C-A-T-S” or “Rock Chalk Jayhawks,” I longed for just one rendition of the SoCal spellout or a stadium crowd of 75,000 singing “Fight On” in unison.
I hope you get to experience a Final Four, except with the Cardinal and Gold playing on the court.
As the passion of the four fan bases enveloped me during my stay in the Big Easy, I worried whether my school, my program and my rabid fan base would ever get to electrify a venue like the Superdome or the Georgia Dome or the Alamodome.
As of today, I’ve almost made as many Final Four appearances as the USC men’s program.
The Trojans’ only two Final Four appearances came in 1940 and 1954, when the tournament wasn’t the big dance it is today. There weren’t 64 teams or the level of national coverage today’s elite programs receive on a daily basis. If you lived during the time period, the Final Four was only a little more than a blurb and a box score in the newspaper the next day. Let’s just say teams like La Salle and Duquesne were not huge draws.
Fifty-eight years have come and gone, and USC has nothing to show for it. The party has gotten bigger over the years, yet the Trojans seem less and less invested in trying to get an invitation back to a Final Four.
It might seem like I’m trying to have my cake and eat it too. I understand how privileged I am to go to a university like USC where athletics aren’t just another program on campus, but rather an integral part of the fabric.
Who can argue with the history and prestige of the football or baseball programs, the world-renowned recognition our Olympic sports such as track and field, swimming and water polo have received through the years, and the school’s willingness to expand with new sports like women’s sand volleyball and lacrosse.
But until you drink the Kool-Aid that is the Final Four, it’s hard to imagine what it would be like to witness the backdrop of a CBS broadcast in late March filled with the sounds of the Trojan Marching Band and a sea of cardinal and gold.
USC is not a basketball school — that much is for sure. Though the men’s program is the second-biggest revenue sport on campus, you’d hardly notice it given the lack of attention it’s received over the years by fans, the local media and, at times, even the athletic program.
The team has had its share of well-known leaders through the years, whether it be George Raveling, Henry Bibby or Kevin O’Neill. But those names don’t have the same pedigree as a Rick Pitino, a Roy Williams, a John Calipari or a Bill Self.
Despite a tremendous location, a beautiful new arena and a bevy of athletic talent in Southern California, there is a growing sentiment that if the men’s program has a good year here and there, it’s just the cherry on top of the other achievements the athletic department accumulates in a given 365-day period.
Over the years we’ve sort of collectively pigeonholed ourselves as the football school of the city, while leaving the hardcourt duties to our neighbors 15 miles away.
It’s a bad mindset, and whether you believe it exists or not, the proof is in our Final Four-less pudding. More than half a century and not a whole lot to show for it, outside of a few retired numbers and some noteworthy draft selections.
But if you asked Paul Westphal, Harold Miner or DeMar DeRozan, they’d probably tell you the same thing — for a school like USC, with as rich an athletic tradition as any school in the country, it’s disheartening not to see a Trojan team even come close to the first Monday in April.
There is no simple fix, because national championship-winning coaches are not a dime a dozen, injuries cannot be prevented, the one-and-done rule poses challenges in the recruiting process, and, above all else, changing the culture is not as easy as flipping a proverbial switch.
But it has to start from top to bottom. The athletic program needs to slowly but surely — whether it takes three years or 30 — build a program that feels like it has a chance to compete for more than just the occasional NCAA tournament appearance. It’s time to treat the big-revenue sport like it belongs on our campus and not as the awkward, less successful step-brother to the football program.
After all, isn’t it about time we had our own one shining moment?

You lost all credibility when you opened your paragraph with “The basketball players are talented.”
The basketball players are talented. The Galen Center is built for the basketball team. The school supports the basketball program. And we have a few coaches. Still, we are not making the final four. Now some of these talented basketball players are basking to be transferred to other schools. What is the answer to it ? Coach had been given time to do what he can do so much. In order to keep the players & future recruits, its time to spend some time to look for a winning coach, before we lose the whole basketball team. In football, coach Caroll had transferred the football program to one champion team.
There’s little to no chance of making the Final Four with Coach O’Neill leading our team. He’s not the answer.

USC baseball coach Frank Cruz put it very simply. His team needed to do one thing better: execute.
That’s exactly what they did last night against Pepperdine, rallying from a three-run deficit to come away with a 5-4 victory over the Waves (17-12).
The winning run came in the seventh inning courtesy of some of the very execution Cruz was talking about. Senior centerfielder Garret Houts walked with one out, stole second base on a ball in the dirt, moved to third on a ground out and scored on a two-out single by senior catcher Kevin Roundtree.
Coming up clutch · Senior catcher Kevin Roundtree won the game with his single in the bottom of the seventh inning. The Trojans have now won four of their last six games and sit at 17-9 overall. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
“Houts moving to second on that ball in the dirt was a big play in the game,” Cruz said. “That’s part of the execution we’re talking about —  reading the ball in the dirt.”
Senior pitcher Martin Viramontes came in for the last two innings, allowing just one baserunner while recording his fourth save of the season for the Trojans (17-9).
“Our pitching is showing us they’re gonna keep us in game,” Cruz said. “We have to give them enough runs.”
The Trojans got on the board right away courtesy of some small ball. Houts and junior second baseman Adam Landecker led off the Trojan first with back-to-back singles to put runners at the corners, and Roundtree followed that up with an RBI ground out to second to put USC up 1-0.
On the mound for the Trojans was Bobby Wheatley. Making his first career start, the sophomore pitcher dealt three perfect innings before bowing out.
“Wheatley was incredible,” Cruz said. “The only reason we took him out is because we might have him start this Saturday and needed to save him.”
Junior Matt Munson came on in the fourth and promptly gave up back-to-back singles to put runners at first and second. The next hitter knocked a slow roller to sophomore shortstop James Roberts, whose hurried throw was well wide of first. The error tied the game at one and put runners on second and third, still with no outs.
The next hitter did the exact same thing, but this time Roberts thought better of hurrying a throw and held on to the ball, resulting in an infield single that put the Waves up 2-1. With runners at the corners, Munson induced a 4-6-3 double play, but that allowed a third Pepperdine run to score from third before finally getting out of the inning.
Pepperdine put another run across in the fifth after another Trojan throwing error, but USC answered right back in the bottom of the inning.
Senior designated hitter Brandon Garcia led off the inning with a leadoff double down the left field line, and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Roberts followed that up with an RBI single that blooped just over the head of the second baseman to make it a 4-2 game. A sacrifice bunt moved Roberts to second, and then a walk, a flyout and another walk loaded the bases with two out for sophomore first baseman Jake Hernandez, who worked his way into the starting lineup over the weekend.
Hernandez came through with a two-RBI single through the right side, igniting the crowd at Dedeaux Field and tying the game at four, setting the table for Roundtree’s eventual game-winner.
“It was a big opportunity for us to score some runs,” Hernandez said. “I want people to have confidence in me so I’m just trying to do the best I can.”
Garcia also emphasized the team’s need to execute down the stretch.
“We’ve been trying to make execution more of a priority,” said Garcia. “We understand that puts pressure on the defense. We got a couple of hit-and-runs down today. We need to get our bunts down and continue on this process of executing.”
The Trojans have a short week before they will need to execute all over again. The Bears come to Dedeaux for a Thursday through Saturday set to avoid playing on Easter.
The Daily Trojan needs to figure it out, the headline and picture are about catcher KEVIN ROUNDTREE, Garrett Houts is an outfielder. How can something so simple be incorrect?
Come on again, the picture mentions Garrett Houts as the catcher which is Kevin Roundtree. This has
become the Daily Mistake for the sports section which is a joke and laughable if not sad by the inept
concern for accuracy.

Imagine you’re walking to your local liquor store when you unexpectedly encounter a giant M painted in swirling patterns on top of an equally mesmerizing blue background, occupying the wall from top to bottom.
In the jungle · Victor Reyes’ “Lion,” currently on display at Known Gallery as part of his art show The Jungle, demonstrates the artist’s affinity for jump-off-the-wall color use and extreme attention to detail. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
This giant “M” is one of street artist Victor Reyes’ many works of art.
Reyes began painting in the ’90s and his work has been shown in a multitude of countries, from Japan to Germany. Notably, over the course of two years, Reyes managed to paint all 26 letters of the alphabet on the streets of  the Mission District in San Francisco.
His art changed the landscape: Now residents could walk past the usual walls and alleys and see them transformed into an artist’s canvases.
His second solo show at Known Gallery on Fairfax Avenue, titled The Jungle, strives to explore the nature of humanity and survival and uses the human body and animals as common themes. Even the colors are chosen purposefully to evoke emotion or more deeply portray the human body.
With The Jungle, Reyes proves that his command of color and type has remained strong. Though the pieces of The Jungle can be frightening at times and calming at others, all are consistently intricate and eye-catching — Reyes’ pieces practically leap from the white walls of the gallery.
But even when the colors of his pieces are muted or black and white, the complexity of Reyes’ works make them compelling. “Diamond,” one of the first pieces visitors see as they walk in, is a good example of this, as it uses a strictly black-and-white palette to great success. Its swirling patterns are contrasted by some well-placed hard lines, and the conglomeration is set off in the shape of a diamond placed against a black canvas. The piece, which features mixed media on wood, can keep a viewer staring for more than just a couple of minutes.
Across the wall lies “The Jungle,” a piece contrasting the simple palette of “Diamond” with an explosion of color. Its many details, from dripping paint to circular shapes that look like eyes, show how Reyes can create as much intricacy with color as he can with only black and white. The beautifully chaotic piece keeps the viewer’s eyes in motion and shows off Reyes’ ability to choose the right way to blend dark colors with bright ones.
Much of Reyes’ work challenges the viewer to look more closely. If seen from far away, “Lions” looks only like a canvas with a variety  of bright and neutral colors swirling together.
But upon closer examination, a viewer can spot two feral animals fighting each other. A lion’s large face, with perhaps a paw below, emerges from the many colors with bright orange strokes. The lion’s face is intricately painted, with small dabs of color sprinkled everywhere, including the tip of the lion’s nose. The opposing animal shows the same attention to detail, but with more subdued colors.
Reyes also demonstrates his talent with typography, creating some pieces dedicated to playing with the image and shape of letters. The letters won’t reel many viewers in quite as much as the other pieces do, but they still recall Reyes’ ability to craft visually engaging works of typography.
Not all works are displayed on traditionally shaped canvases: Certain pieces are set up together and even stacked, such as with a triangular canvas on top of a rectangular one.
Some relationships between canvases are clearer than others, but all the triangular pieces manage to communicate a savage or dark feeling within a small space, featuring a use of darker colors and images of subjects like skulls and tigers.
Reyes also shows off some unconventional ingenuity: Several pieces named “Quilt” run along a wall, placed right next to each other with their respective numbers; the pieces are displayed together, but sell separately. The idea of creating a quilt-like display, and naming the pieces so, cleverly presents the idea that even if the pieces in the show seem different, they are related.
The Jungle doesn’t let viewers just glance at a piece and move on — it demands attention with its complexity and dedication to its theme.
The idea of a jungle in artwork might not seem the most original, but in the hands of Reyes, the concept transformed.
 
The Jungle is on view until April 7. Known Gallery is located at 441 North Fairfax Ave.

The appeal of unleavened bread might be limited. At least that’s how the food would sound to anyone unfamiliar with the thin, cracker-like matzo, a Jewish dietary staple that makes a resurgence with the arrival of Passover this time of year.
The common explanation for matzo’s origins is that Israelites had little time to flee Egypt during their Biblical exodus, resulting in bread that had to be flattened and quickly baked. Matzo is thereby eaten as a form of symbolic remembrance at Passover.
But for those of you not observing the holiday, or who choose not to keep kosher, the question becomes this: If you don’t have to eat matzo, why eat it?
Answer? The crunch. The wide surface that takes well to spreads. The random bits of baked flavor. These are reasons to embrace matzo.
Another vital reason is its versatility.
Bon Appétit, The New York Times and Martha Stewart Living have all recommended ways to diversify the Seder, the traditional Passover meal. And all have provided funky new recipes introducing flavors like rosemary and olive oil to toasted matzo.
Then there are matzo balls. I’ve written previously about The Gorbals’ bacon-wrapped matzo balls and Lukshon’s silky, Asian-inflected matzo ball soup. The writer-historian Marcie Cohen Ferris even wrote the definitive book on Jewish Southern food, Matzoh Ball Gumbo. The title recipe incorporates a spicy Creole seasoning into the matzo balls — just another example of how easy it is to improvise, personalize and regionalize a recipe.
But for the traditionalist, the standby matzo recipes still hold strong. However, you must keep in mind that the best matzo — crumbly and buttery with dark, popped bubbles throughout — is prepackaged.
There are plenty of ways to try matzo, both new and old: An open-faced matzo sandwich is like having a bread’s crust without the doughy center. And for those that prefer this crunch, matzo becomes a worthy substitute.
Spreading some grainy mustard on a piece and topping it with some slices of pastrami and a pickled tomato is the stuff of deli dreams.
Keep in mind that Langer’s Delicatessen has the best pastrami, a widely acknowledged fact cemented by a prestigious James Beard award. Langer’s is only three miles from campus, a distance justified as walkable if you’ve ever tasted its “Number 19” sandwich, which flaunts hot slices of pastrami piled high with slaw, cheese and Russian dressing.
Another favorite is Hershey’s-dipped matzo, in which pieces of the unleavened bread are dipped in melted chocolate and left in the freezer until ready for consumption.
The combination of the two flavors, along with the once-a-year joy of matzo and the childhood memories of a melted Hershey’s bar, provides the teary-eyed, first-bite delight only the most special foods inspire.
Matzo often serves as a substitute for other ingredients, too.
Oats fall into a kosher gray area, so if you have the matzo, you might as well do good with it. Matzo granola is a cinch to make, and it tastes better toasted in a skillet than baked in an oven, as granola typically is. Here’s how to make it:
1. Lather a square of matzo with canola oil, sprinkle lightly with salt and generously with sugar and cinnamon.
2. Break over a hot skillet and let cook at medium heat until the sugar has glazed the matzo, and the edges of many pieces turn black, roughly four to six minutes.
3. To finish, add some chopped cinnamon almonds, like those available at Fresh & Easy and some golden raisins.
Finally, there’s matzo brei. Matzo brei gives texture to eggs and a pleasant dampness to matzo, creating a sort of free-form French toast. The recipe — my family’s — is as follows:
1. Break three squares of matzo into uneven, bite-size pieces and soak in warm water for about one minute until wet but not saturated.
2. Take matzo out of water and drain in colander to get the excess moisture out.
3. Mix four eggs in a bowl with a splash of milk until frothy.
4. Add matzo to egg mixture — mix well but carefully, as to not break up the matzo.
5. Heat skillet on medium heat with a dab of butter, enough to coat the bottom of the pan.
6. Add egg/matzo mixture and cook until tender, about four and a half to five minutes, or until desired doneness. You can treat the mixture much like scrambled eggs.
7. Season with salt and sugar or a cinnamon-sugar combination. A side of applesauce is also recommended.
Though using just egg whites is a healthier alternative than including the yolk, the matzo brei will lack significantly in flavor. Texture is important too — the dish is about the doneness of the matzo and wetness of the eggs. You should be appreciating chewiness in one bite, and savoring crisp, burnt pieces the next.
There’s always Langer’s, Nate ‘n Al’s, Canter’s or Barney Greengrass to get your matzo-dish fix too. But when it comes to this kind of comforting Jewish soul food, your own efforts in the kitchen should suffice.

Surprising people is the hardest task for a traditional sitcom to accomplish. Audiences are more than accustomed to the laugh track, the “will they or won’t they?” through-line and the set-up, punchline, and repeat style of comedy. The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother are huge successes primarily because of this familiarity. Plenty of television comedies take more risks, but they do so by abandoning the standard tropes of the genre and exploring different formats.
Laugh out loud · Joe Lynch (left) and Dee Snider (right) take center stage in FEARnet’s unconventional, horror-meets-comedy show Holliston. - Photo courtesy of FEARnet
FEARnet’s Holliston is something truly unique: a show that, in many ways, follows in the footsteps of traditional sitcoms while still having an identity all its own.
The first television program ever made by FEARnet draws directly from the experiences of director Adam Green (Hatchet, Frozen), who plays an exaggerated version of himself.
Everyone in the cast is “making fun of themselves at the time in their life when they were struggling,” Green said, commenting on the entire principal cast members retaining their actual names when in character.
And that struggle is really what it’s all about, as the show follows the story of Adam Green and Joe Lynch, two aspiring horror filmmakers failing to break out of their hometown of Holliston, Mass., the small neighborhood from which Green hails.
To call this a passion project would be an understatement. Green, who directed, wrote and starred in every episode, “didn’t sleep more than an hour and a half to two hours a night during production.”
His dedication shows: Holliston is exactly what he wants it to be, an earnest sitcom for mature audiences, with an over-dramatic “oohing” and “ahhing” laugh track one minute, and a reference to the movie Scanners — complete with a violently exploding head — the next.
The tone is consistent, but the content featured is wildly bizarre, nothing more so than Green’s imaginary friend Oderus Urungus, an alien played by the lead of satirical heavy metal band GWAR, who resides in his closet and emerges about once an episode to give unhelpful advice.
It’s the kind of thing no network in its right mind would ever greenlight.
Luckily for Green and company, FEARnet is in the unique position of not having anything else to compare it to; for its first show it wanted to “do the unexpected.” In that respect, the show certainly succeeded.
At the very least, no one will accuse Green, company and the network of being unwilling to take chances when they see Green pine for his lost love Corri then, when spurned, bloodily gash his chest with a straight razor, all brightly lit in front of a standard three camera set-up.
The astounding thing about Holliston is that it’s likely to alienate some audiences while winning over others, although absolutely none of it is particularly tongue-in-cheek.
“This isn’t a parody of a sitcom,” Green clarified. “It’s a sitcom.”
It just happens to be a very unique one that, despite its subject matter, isn’t solely for horror fans.
Some test screenings have targeted viewers of the aforementioned currently popular sitcoms to see if Green’s world translates, and apparently it does. This makes sense, considering The Big Bang Theory viewers likely miss a good deal of that show’s references to what might be called “nerd culture.”
Holliston takes it further, making references so obscure yet naturally integrated that no one could doubt for a second the creative forces behind the camera — many of whom in this case are also in front of the camera — are outsiders looking in.
Rather, they’re celebrating the horror-loving lifestyle that they’re entirely a part of.
But the central themes of Holliston have nothing to do with fear or the grotesque. Instead the show is a celebration of Green’s beliefs.
“No matter what life throws at you, if you don’t let it change who you are and disenchant you, it will get better,” Green said.
The very existence of this series, which has existed conceptually in some form or another for 13 years now, is “living proof that if you don’t give up it can happen.” So similar to what’s already out there, yet so assured of its own identity, there’s nothing on the air quite like Holliston.
 
Holliston premieres April 3 at 7:30 p.m. on FEARnet.

Ramona Gonzalez commands a lucidly ironed voice, and her pitch goes without wrinkles and swells solemnly enough to inflate a cathedral. It’s fitting, then, that Gonzalez began recording songs in 2008. She decided to do this under the guise of Nite Jewel.
Based in Los Angeles, she works mainly with husband and producer Cole M. Greif-Neill, who she describes as “the other quarter or third of Nite Jewel.”
Gonzalez marks her territory with her latest album One Second of Love, which was released under Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian. The label hosts a roster of youthful acts that include Yeasayer and Gardens & Villa.  Using warm, lo-fi electronic grooves that would find appropriate settings on a warm summer night inside a big pair of headphones, Gonzalez has arrived.
“My dad was into Gloria Estefan, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, just all the greats. Later I got really into ’90s girl groups like TLC, SWV and Aaliyah,” Gonzalez said. “Aaliyah became really big for me because she was sort of an anti-pop star pop star. She was really mellow in her vocal delivery. I think I drew a lot of that mellow vocal delivery style on my first record from her.”
Absorbing the talents of influential girl groups made its way into her music and her dreams.
“I’ve always wanted to be in some other life like a professional singer/diva from the ’80s or ’90s just belting at the Grammys,” Gonzalez said.
To record One Second of Love, Nite Jewel’s follow-up to her debut release Good Evening in 2009, Gonzalez was able to work in a professional recording studio for the first time since college. The results are evident and only add testament to her previous releases, which she recorded herself with an 8-track machine.
The title track, “One Second of Love,” arrives with an energy that evokes being stranded on a treadmill. The groove is fuzzy and aerobic as Gonzalez strides over a croaking bass line. Gonzalez slaps dimension to her voice with backing vocals that stick to her like a shadow. To describe the song is complicated, but to appreciate it is simple, as is the central question Gonzalez asks, “Who has one second of love?”
Several songs pour forward with tranquil intent, including the final track on the album, “Clive.” “Clive” is built out of sustained chords and upper register vocals from Gonzalez combining to buoy the listener atop a seraphic ocean of sound. Other tracks that produce a similar effect are “No I Don’t,” “Unearthly Delights” and the opening track, “This Story,” although “Clive” feels the most distilled.
“One Second of Love seems post-bubble-burst. It’s a record about what happens during the downward slope into questioning everything that you knew before,” Gonzalez said. “There is a lot of questioning of society and culture but also questioning of one’s relationships.”
Gonzalez is well-practiced in sifting emotion from inquiry. Her reincarnation as Nite Jewel is an extension of her studies in philosophy at Occidental College. A sharp sense of analytic judgment lines her music and is something she recognizes as vital to her approach.
“Judgment is very useful for the artistic process because you are not just taking things for what they are. It helps you to create more layers of meaning in a song,” Gonzalez said. “It also goes for being in academia. With a sense of judgment that is really attuned, you can take it in multiple directions: You can write a song about it, you can do a painting about it. I think that analytical process is very useful for a lot of things.”
Gonzalez’s practice of judgment to create music is something that appears to manifest itself in every aspect of her life.
“I draw a lot of inspiration from social energy, especially at parties,” Gonzalez said.
Throughout the record, there exists a dialogue between Gonzalez and a jarring presence that seems to haunt her. You get the sense that Gonzalez isn’t talking to an audience — instead, her observant lyrics suggest that she has a particular person in mind. Though the chances are highly unlikely, the listener still oddly gets the sense that that very person is himself.

There’s more to USC athletics than football.  
Football is and has always been king at USC. The football team is a perennial contender for the BCS National Championship year in and year out, and it deservedly receives the most attention, considering the national popularity of the sport.
The problem is that attendance lacks in just about every other sport at USC.
With all the attention the Trojan football team garners, it is easy to overlook the successes of USC’s other sports teams. In 2011, the USC men’s tennis team locked up its third straight NCAA title, while the men’s water polo team earned its fourth straight national championship. The USC women’s volleyball team also earned a spot in the NCAA Final Four, where it fell short of advancing to the championship game.
Many of USC’s athletic programs and athletes achieve great successes, but they do so with little fanfare, as student attendance struggles for many of the less popular sports.
Why is attendance struggling? Some people might point to the fair-weather L.A. sports fan argument, but that doesn’t fly — we have consistently top-ranked teams that are competing for national championships. The problem stems from the culture and tradition surrounding USC athletics as a whole.
Understandably, football has always been the primary emphasis because it drives revenues for the athletic department and helps fund other sports. But these other sports have been overshadowed in the process.
We must attempt to change the culture and tradition surrounding USC athletics and increase student support for sports aside from football.
USC’s athletic marketing department has attempted to address student attendance at athletic competitions through its Trojan Fever Loyalty Program, in which students earn points and win prizes for attending various sporting events. Free food and various giveaways (cups, bobbleheads, etc.) have also been used to increase attendance, and large boards have been strategically placed around campus to alert students of athletic event start times.
Admittedly, I am a student who has never attended a USC sporting event aside from football games and a couple of men’s basketball games. I take responsibility for my lack of support and will make a conscious effort to attend more athletic events in the future. I urge all students to do the same.
The athletic department is certainly doing its part to entice students to attend sporting events and improve the fan experience, but it is up to us to attend games and support our fellow Trojans. Fight On!

Gang activity is difficult to measure. Different organizations have different ways of defining a gang member, and the competing systems lead to discrepancies in reports on levels of gang activity.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
This ambiguity makes it hard to tell whether gang-prevention programs are effective. It’s even harder to connect the efforts of any one program to perceived improvements.
These issues lie at the heart of the recent debate over the findings on Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s multimillion-dollar program, Gang Reduction and Youth Development.
In defense of the program, Villaraigosa asserted that his positive data is “incontrovertible.”
He highlighted a 17 percent overall reduction in gang crime since the inception of the program.
But the data is not nearly as clear as the mayor’s office makes it appear. Inconsistencies between data collectors conspire to make it rather convertible.
Instead of hiding behind its questionable data, GRYD should involve more researchers, take alternative viewpoints into account and begin reforming the program.
The very definition of “gang activity” relies heavily on the extent to which events are connected to individual gang members. A crime can be counted as a gang crime because the victim was involved with gang members, even though other organizations no longer consider that person a gang member. Some gang databases list people as gang members years after they have stopped engaging in any gang-related activity.
With the disagreements over definitions, it is easy to see where doubts can emerge.
Beyond conflicting numbers, it is extremely difficult to connect reduced gang activity with the efforts of GRYD alone. The Urban Institute, the agency that performed the study on the effectiveness of the program, explains the trend was observable before the foundation of the program in 2007.
Many factors might contribute to a decrease in gang activity, so claiming that this reduction is largely thanks to GRYD’s efforts is misleading.
Thomas W. Ward, a USC professor who is an expert on youth violence and gang intervention and prevention, shares the skepticism of the Urban Institute toward the program’s claims, if only based on the scarce success that past gang programs have achieved. He said these programs are combatting gangs in the wrong fields.
Currently, GRYD focuses on areas such as youth mentoring, violence prevention, parenting classes, family therapy and mediation to combat the escalation of shootings. Though the list is long, it is by no means comprehensive.
“Instead of what these agencies are doing, they should focus a lot more on drug education and prevention and finding jobs for these individuals,” Ward said.
Larger involvement by experts who deal with gang members on a personal basis would allow for a refocusing of programs like GRYD toward a more definitive outcome.
In terms of distance, the world of gangs and gang activity is very close to USC. Thankfully, the associated dangers do not reach campus. One can live nearby and never hear a thing about the turmoil raging a short drive away.
Still, as residents of Los Angeles and members of the community, it is important for us to be aware of the issues facing our city. If we observe failures or waste in the city’s attempts to fix its problems, it’s important to express dissatisfaction to the city — or to Villaraigosa’s office — about these shortcomings.
It is equally important to make sure these shortcomings are transparent.

David Lynch, famous for having created the surreal TV series, Twin Peaks, and then a slew of hallucinogenic feature-lengths, mainly creates music now. But with Lynch’s music video for “Crazy Clown Time,” the title track of his new album, he has re-entered the world of filmmaking, with expectedly eerie results.
The song itself is very simple: Lynch, singing in a childish falsetto, repeats over and over a few sentences describing one nonsensical scene of freakishness during a backyard barbecue. A single drum set provides a beat which Lynch nestles with a party mix of uncanny mumbling and sexual moans and horrific screams. The title, “Crazy Clown Time,” comes from the chorus, which refers to the characters all running around the backyard, and which goes: It was crazy clown time. It was really fun. It was real fun.
The music video’s video component pretty straightforwardly recreates the lyrics’ creepy collage, adding nudity and some characters and a few fleeting glimpses of Lynch himself. Everything is set in a sparsely lit backyard on grass carpeted with garbage and discarded clothes. This extends the song’s juxtaposition of childish with ghoulish, perhaps leading listeners to divine some stern argument about sexual deviance or the dark nature of backyard barbecues.
But, as David Foster Wallace said of David Lynch in a 1996 essay: “He seems to care more about penetrating your head than about what he does once he’s in there.” Lynch is not making a point. He’s just goofing around. That is the secret behind the song’s title: The author himself is the titular crazy clown, a child telling a nonsense story, an entertainer only really interested in entertaining himself. David Lynch will not win any Grammies and you can tell he doesn’t care.
