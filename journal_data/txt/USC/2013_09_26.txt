On Wednesday, the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, The Can Kicks Back and USC EdMonth hosted “Generational Equity: The Impact of the Federal Budget on Young Americans” to discuss the effect of the debt on the millenial generation.

The Can Kicks Back is non-partisan campaign that aims to educate, organize and mobilize young Americans in order to promote a sustainable federal budget that is fair to all generations. The program featured guests Geoffrey Canada, President of the Harlem Children’s Zone and Stanley Druckenmiller, former chairman of Duquesne Capital Management and was moderated by David Belasco, co-director and adjunct professor at Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. Nick Triano and Ryan Schoenike, two of the co-founders of The Can Kicks Back also attended the event.
“The reason why we’re stopping here at USC is that we really need to educate [the students] because they’re really not informed about the issue, and why they need to be active in the first place,” Schoenike said.
Druckenmiller is an American hedge fund manager and chairs the board of Harlem’s Children’s Zone. He was also the most charitable man in America in 2009, donating $705 million to various foundations.
Geoffrey Canada is the president and CEO of Harlem’s Children Zone, a nonprofit organization that runs programs that are aimed at breaking the cycle of generational poverty for impoverished children and families in central Harlem. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from various prestigious universities, including a Doctor of Laws from Princeton and a Doctor of Humane Letters from University of Pennsylvania.
The Can Kicks Back serves as the millennial outreach partner of Fix the Debt, a nonpartisan movement to put America on a better fiscal and economic path. Founded in 2012 by five people. The Can Kicks Back has since grown to more than 100 chapters in 38 states with over 20,000 supporters.
“We’re very excited to do an event [at USC] with both [Druckenmiller and Canada] because they are very passionate about the issue and they can explain the consequences very well,” Schoenike said.
Canada expressed his belief that student education on the debt is important, because he was raising kids through the Harlem Children’s Zone to be productive members of society and couldn’t let them out into a society that was functionally broken because of debt.
Druckenmiller spoke more of his personal background, and of how he went from dropping out of graduate school to making millions of dollars a year, as well as his love for philanthropy.
“I have a talent for compounding money,” Druckenmiller said jokingly. “But the best part of it is seeing it at work.”
Druckenmiller led a presentation about the issues with the national debt, and how spending, especially among entitlements, is predicted to increase in the next few years. Special attention was paid to how spending for the elderly has increased drastically in the past 50 years and is predicted to continue increasing, while spending for children and youth had dropped in the same periods.
Both Druckenmiller and Canada expressed their belief that reforms in both spending and education as well as a mentality shift about entitlements were needed for America to pull itself out of debt. A short Q&A session followed the presentation.
The program maintained a relatively lighthearted feel, with both Druckenmiller and Canada often using humor in their speeches. Many students in the MBA program at the Marshall School of Business attended, as well as professors and teachers from the surrounding area including LMU and UCLA. Karen Symms Gallagher, dean of the USC Rossier School of Education and John Deasy, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District were also present.
Students were especially impressed by the presenters’ knowledge and experience.
“We got to be exposed to some of the larger contextual problems in our society, such as education and government spending,” said Russell Yue, a freshman majoring in accounting. “I also found it really interesting how people are really devoting their lives to change young people’s lives and foster a better community for the future.”
Tiffanie Chung, a freshman majoring in accounting, agreed that the speakers were fascinating.
“We’re actually really lucky to have [Druckenmiller and Canada] here, and to hear them talk about their experiences and the world is interesting,” she said.

It’s really frustrating that spending on the youth has decreased while elderly spending has increased. I understand that our country is in debt and things need to be cut but our country’s youth is our future. People are living longer and need care but I do not think that the money put toward the next generation should be the sacrificial lamb. As a country we need to remember that our future lies in them.

Playboy magazine released their annual “Top Party School” list on Wednesday, ranking USC No. 4, a drop from the school’s No. 2 ranking on last year’s list.
West Virginia University was ranked first, while University of Virginia, last year’s top school, failed to make the top 10 this year. University of Wisconsin and University of Colorado were ranked second and third respectively.
According to Playboy editors, the schools were ranked based on data from the NCAA, the U.S. Economic Census, the National Center for Education Statistics and social media.
Students had mixed reactions to the rankings.
“I think it’s a good thing in the sense that USC caters to the students who like to party, but still go to a top academic university. It keeps the balance between how much tougher USC is becoming to get into, but it still draws kids that are interested in the party aspect and the social scene,” said Drew Eller, a junior majoring in business and cinematic arts. “’SC has a name and image to it that Playboy is probably playing into, being in L.A., and the idea of us being a party school. But I don’t think we’re necessarily top four or that it means anything, really.”
Annie Passan, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business), agreed with Eller that the rankings are not that significant.
“It doesn’t really matter to me because I know the context of the statistics do not apply to the school as a whole. Not everyone at ’SC parties all the time.” Passan said.
The credibility of this list in terms of its ranking criteria was also a concern for some students.
“How legitimate is the Playboy rating? That’s an important question — who comes up with these ratings? And if it is legitimate, it speaks of that fact that we work hard and play hard.” said Kiersten Stanley, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “Plus, we have a really big Greek culture, and by parties do they mean ragers or house parties? There are no clear categories.”
Like Eller, however, she thought that ’SC is a big name in the party school scene.
“It’s definitely not hard to find parties here.” Stanley said. “We also have a very relaxed culture about partying — we aren’t super religious — and probably because it is so relaxed, you don’t hear of huge problems connected to the partying — other than the few hospital transports of people overdoing it.”
Earlier this year, BroBible, a news website that describes itself as the “ultimate destination for Bros,” ranked USC No. 20 on its top party school list.
Vidal Woods, a junior majoring in cinematic arts and international relations felt concerned about the academic implications this ranking would have for USC in the future.
“If we continue to boast and promote this, there might be certain parents that would be hesitant to let their kids come here,” Woods said. “We’re trying to promote USC as a top academic institution, and if we want to attract the top kids, in terms of academics, their parents, who pay the tuition, are not going to want to send their kids to the No. 4 party school in the nation.”
USC is also the only private school and the only Southern California school featured on the list.
Party on!
Not everyone on the row is partying every night!

The USC Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted Professor Ira Wagman of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada to discuss the origins and historical context of celebrity diplomacy.
Wagman, who teaches communication studies at the School of Journalism at Carleton University and is the Fulbright research chair for Canada, discussed how celebrity involvement in humanitarian issues has changed the practice of diplomacy.
Wagman opened the discussion with an introduction of the first celebrity diplomat Danny Kaye, an entertainer in the 1950s who visited Southeast Asia for children’s charities and became the first ambassador for UNICEF.
He spoke about how Hollywood in the post-war era was feeling the tumultuous effects of the House Un-American Activities Committee, the anti-communist sentiments of the public and the suspicions of the American government aimed towards the film industry.
Wagman said this drove the establishment of celebrity involvement in diplomatic affairs, enhancing the reputations of both the charity organizations and the celebrities. Wagman then discussed the public perception of celebrity diplomacy.
“I want to encourage a movement in the discussion about celebrity diplomacy away from the ‘help-or-hurt’ model in the way we think about celebrity diplomacy,” Wagman said.
Wagman also brought up questions of the effects of celebrity diplomacy and how the process ties into the public’s views on media technology.
“In a way, celebrity diplomacy brings up the issue of our deep ambivalences and anxieties that we feel about celebrities and media,” Wagman said.
Wagman also pointed out that because celebrities often have controversial opinions, the public does not necessarily view celebrity diplomacy in a positive light.
“I would like to think that there is a process in picking someone and that that person is going to contribute to the cause, but that’s not always the case,” Wagman said.
In terms of the effectiveness of celebrity diplomacy, Wagman brought up the question of just how much money celebrities donate.
“There are major issues with celebrity campaigns. We place an incredible emphasis on these people, but what does it do at the end of the day?” Wagman said.
Center of Public Diplomacy alumna Leah Rousseau, who now works at the Canadian Consulate of Los Angeles, attended the event and commented on the lasting effects of celebrity diplomacy.
“Do [celebrities] have any set goals for when they show up to these events? Bono can throw a charity concert, but that doesn’t have a lasting effect on the people attending it,” Rousseau said.
Rousseau also brought up other types of celebrity diplomacy, such as diplomatic discussions.
“George Clooney is much more of an advocacy type of celebrity because he isn’t trying to sell a product; he goes to the White House and talks about Sudan without needing to host a concert,” Rousseau said.
The idea of celebrities performing more charity efforts seemed constructive to many students who attended the event.
Jocelyn Coffin, a first-year graduate student studying public diplomacy, had a positive viewpoint on celebrities’ involvement in charities and other causes.
“I think there’s a lot of value in it as a tool of diplomacy, and I do think there’s a lot of positives and negatives associated with it,” Coffin said. “I think you have to go forward with it with a lot of caution, but I think it’s a good tool to use in targeting specific people for causes.”
Danielle Saroyan, a graduate student of public diplomacy, also appreciates the use of celebrity diplomacy as a way of publicizing charitable causes.
“I think it’s actually good that they use celebrities as a media tool to spread the word,” Saroyan said. “I think it’s a really effective media campaign.”
 
Yes.. So true. hate them..

USC students, faculty and visitors received a surprise in the courtyard behind Doheny Memorial Library Thursday afternoon in the form of a “flash play,” put on by USC Libraries in partnership with the School of Dramatic Arts.
Flash act · Students, alumni and an actress perform in a surprise flash play in the courtyard of Doheney Memorial Library on Thursday. afternoon. – Isabella Sayyah | Daily Trojan
The play, directed by Oliver Mayer, associate professor of dramatic writing, was performed by a group of four students and alumni, as well as Dallas actress Marlene Forte, Mayer’s wife.
“I love the idea of agitprop, which is what really made a difference back in the day, so when I heard about the flash plays I was like, ‘I want to be in one,’” Forte said.
The group put together the first flash play last year in front of Doheny, and is planning on holding three or four more this semester.
“We’re doing one for Lewis Carroll because that’s a big thing that they do around Alice in Wonderland; one for the ONE collection, which is the LGBT archive; one we think we’re going to do in the Engineering [Library], because it’s the most used library and one in [the] Fine Arts [Library],” Mayer said.
Though the play focused specifically on Doheny and the different libraries within it, the group also described Thursday’s play as an introduction to the libraries in general.
“It’s a remount of the premier of the original one we did in the spring,” said Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, a recent graduate and the director of the flash play. “We remounted it with some adjustments and another cast to celebrate it again and to remind everyone [the libraries] are here.”
Though, true to its name, the flash play was a surprise, some people were tipped off that it would happen. Around noon, many Doheny librarians and staff descended to the courtyard because they had heard that “something” was about to happen there.
For those who do not work at the library, USC Libraries tweeted, and USC retweeted: “Can you keep a secret? Something special might happen today around noon outside Literatea. #USC.”
Others, however, remained in the dark about the approximately five-minute performance, which interrupted their work.
“I was here with a student having a conference, so I was a little bit annoyed that they were interrupting,” said Jessica Harmon, a graduate student in linguistics and a Writing 140 lecturer. “I thought it would be good that a student was there who maybe didn’t know about the libraries and [would] hear about stuff that he wouldn’t necessarily know from living on campus.”
Mayer said that in the future, the plays will be teased through Twitter and Facebook.
Future plays may also have other special guest performers.
“I’m the one who tries to get people who are on TV to do [the plays]because I think that makes it a little fun for everybody,” Forte said.

Daily Trojan sports editor Will Laws interviewed Joshua Nacion, the football team’s beat writer for The State Press at Arizona State, earlier this week to give USC fans a better feel for the Sun Devils ahead of Saturday’s crucial Pac-12 showdown in Tempe.
DT: What do you think quarterback Taylor Kelly’s ceiling/floor is for the game this Saturday? He’s ranked sixth in the country in passing yards per game (339.7), yet he’s only completing 59.9 percent of his passes.
SP: It’s been an interesting start to the season for Kelly. Sure, he’s been noticeably off on his long throws, but his lower completion rate is due to receivers having a recurring issue of dropping catches. He’s still trying to work on his chemistry with senior tight end Chris Coyle, who was his go-to receiver last year, but Jaelen Strong has really helped out Kelly the past two games. Because Kelly is a much better quarterback at home, I wouldn’t be too surprised if he can string together eight or nine consecutive completions in one sequence. If the USC front-seven gets him uncomfortable, Kelly could throw a pick or two and throw under 60 percent, and it’d be tough for Arizona State to win if he plays like that.
DT: What’s going on with Will Sutton? He won the conference’s defensive player of the year award last year but has 0 sacks so far. Are teams double — and triple — teaming him too much to expect success, or is he just having a down year?
SP: It’s just like you indicated — offensive lines are more keyed in to double-teaming him this year. It also doesn’t help that Arizona State played Wisconsin and Stanford — two of the most physical offensive lines you could possibly face — right out of the gates. The Sun Devils do have better depth on the defensive line this year so it’s not like they’re dependent on Sutton’s success in order to win games. All Sutton cares about is stopping the run up the middle and he’s been pretty content with that so far after talking to him on Wednesday. I’m sure Sutton will step it up within the next couple of weeks.
DT: What is the campus’ feelings about the team currently after starting 2-0 before falling to Stanford last week?
SP:  There are obviously pessimists who are doubting Arizona State again after a tough loss to the No. 5 team in the country, but I’ve been seeing a lot of optimism this week. No one in Tempe honestly expected ASU to beat Stanford on the road, yet the second-half rally really showed the team’s character and proved they can still hang with the elite teams. If Arizona State loses this game, though, that’s when the sky will fall here in Tempe.
DT: What’s your prediction for this weekend?
SP: I’ll say 27-13, ASU. It’s a home game for Arizona State and Sun Devil Stadium is a hard place to play anytime when ASU shows some promise for the season. I think we can both agree that this is by far the most talented team USC has faced so far in this young season, and watching the Trojans lose to Washington State and running into trouble against Utah State made Sun Devil Nation feel really confident about this game. Even though USC has its running game going, I can see Cody Kessler having a hard time leading the offense in his first true road game against a D-line anchored by Sutton and Carl Bradford. However, the Trojans can make things interesting if they win the battle of the trenches on both ends, and we all remember the last time Lee played against the Sun Devils.

The Women of Troy (5-3-1) are coming off another bittersweet weekend of play, in which they defeated Florida Atlantic before falling to Cal State Fullerton in their third one-goal loss  of the season. The squad will have to put these tough losses behind it before facing the Sun Devils and the rest of the formidable Pac-12 conference.
Head coach Ali Khosroshahin said he understands that Sunday’s overtime defeat was tough for his team to handle.
“[The loss] was tough, but scoring goals is the hardest thing to do in soccer,” Khosroshahin said. “We just have to keep missed opportunities from frustrating us and keep our composure.”
Senior midfielder Haley Boysen is confident her team can regain its focus after such a frustrating loss.
“Morale is good, our team is very together,” Boysen said. “We’ve been getting a lot of opportunities, we just have to work on finishing them.”
Arizona State (5-3) will also be looking to bounce back from a weekend loss. The Sun Devils lost to Boise State 2-0 last Friday after an impressive 4-0 victory over Southern Utah the previous week.
The squad performed well in their toughest matchup of the year thus far, falling valiantly to then-No. 15 Texas Tech early in the season by a score of 1-0. Against lesser opponents, however, the Sun Devils have occasionally struggled. Two of the team’s three losses came against teams outside of the RPI top 50.
The ASU offense will be led by dynamic sophomore forward Cali Farquharson, whose nine goals put her at 10th nationally in that category, just two below the top scorers. Her teammate Holland Crook has set the table for Farquharson consistently, with an impressive six assists. To handle such a formidable offensive attack, the Women of Troy will have to rely on a defense that has been a point of strength for them all season. Goalkeeper Caroline Stanley has allowed multiple goals in regulation just once this year, with help from a stout backline.
On the defensive end, the Sun Devils are less consistent. Goalkeeper Chandler Morris has saved less than 75 percent of the shots sent her way. The balanced USC offense, which boasts seven different players who have scored, will hope to regain an early season form that saw them score four goals in each of their first three games. Khosroshahin has been emphasizing offense in practice for the last few weeks.
“We have to get quicker on offense and not allow the opposing defense to get set,” the seventh year coach said. “But it takes a while to get that understanding, knowing when to zig and when to zag.”
Sunday’s matchup marks the Women of Troy’s entrance into conference play, where their opponents will be consistently stronger.
Three Pac-12 teams currently stand in the NCAA top 25, with Washington State knocking on the door. No. 2 Stanford remains unbeaten, while No. 4 UCLA and No. 11 California are as strong as ever. If USC can navigate its way through these tough teams and avoid overlooking teams like Arizona State, they will be a threat to make a postseason run.
Players understand that the team’s season just got a lot tougher.
“We are a lot more mentally prepared [during Pac-12 play],” sophomore defender Erin Owen said. “We are practicing getting stronger, faster and more direct.”
Sunday’s game will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 Network at 4 p.m.

The USC men’s water polo team will make its long anticipated return to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday with a doubleheader against No. 11 Princeton and Whittier College.

The Trojans are coming off a loss to UCLA in the NorCal Tournament, their first in 42 games. Their 9-8 defeat pushed them down to the No. 2 ranking nationally.
“It was one of those games where things just didn’t go our way,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “Our effort was there all the way down until the wire.”
The game against Princeton, one of the better schools historically in water polo, will be the Trojans’ first chance to start a new winning streak. Their loss to UCLA ended their impressive 41-game streak, the longest in the nation and just 5 short of the USC record.
Vavic, for the record, seems proud of the way his team is currently handling a rare defeat.
“We’ve had a couple of good days of practice and team meetings, and I’m encouraged by the way the team has handled it,” Vavic said.
One issue for the Trojans in that defeat, and all season really, has been the up-and-down health of freshman Jon Walters, one of the newcomers who was expected to become a key contributor for the five-time champions this fall.
“Walters has been injured since the beginning of the season,” Vavic said. “He only played five minutes (against UCLA).”
Luckily, with Vavic’s expert touch, the Trojans have been turning this severe negative into a positive.
“Not having him is giving other guys an opportunity to step up and play,” Vavic said. “We’re getting to try out some other players that we otherwise wouldn’t.”
Those newcomers off the bench, and the team in general, certainly will enjoy returning home following a grueling three weekends that saw the Trojans play 11 games on the road, including multiple games against ranked opponents.
Following the Princeton match, the Trojans will take a quick break before returning to the pool and playing the Whittier Poets. That game will mark the second time this season that the Trojans have gone up against the Poets. The two met earlier in the month at the Inland Empire Classic, and USC dominated whistle to whistle, winning 21-4 to improve their record to 3-0 all-time against Whittier.
The Trojans will enter this game at the unusually “low” rank of second nationally. USC had held the top mark in the nation since November 2011 before this week, and will be looking to regain the top spot as soon as possible. Vavic, for one, is hoping that the loss can recenter his team.
“Time will tell and I certainly hope it will increase their focus … make them more hungry,” Vavic said.
Vavic’s son, standout senior Nikola Vavic enters this weekend second on the USC all-time scoring list, just 16 goals away from taking over the top spot, which is currently held by Jurai Zatovic, who compiled 220 goals in his four seasons for the Trojans.
Following this weekend’s matchups, the Trojans will wait a week before hosting UC Irvine on Oct. 5, their last tune-up before heading to the Anteaters’ home pool for the SoCal Tournament.

Remember those birthday parties back in elementary school that you felt like you never got invited to? And there’s no reason why you weren’t invited to the party, besides the fact that the one kid just didn’t like you very much. And all your friends that did get invited came to school on Monday talking about how fun it was. And part of you is happy for all your friends and glad they had a good time, but hearing about how much fun they had really just makes you feel bitter about not getting invited.
That essentially embodies the frustration I felt after hearing that the NCAA was reducing its sanctions against the Penn State football program.
USC finished the bowl ban after the 2011 season but still has to deal with scholarship restrictions and vacated wins from Reggie Bush’s time at USC after he took unauthorized gifts from an agent. Basically, Bush’s “party favor” had a little more candy than all the other kids’.
The Nittany Lions received similar sanctions after football officials covered up a series of horrifying felonies committed by former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky.
Countless other top college programs have subsequently committed offenses similar to those made by the USC program, and none garnered more than a slap on the wrist. Fellow Daily Trojan columnist Jake Davidson wrote a piece about the same issue a few weeks ago involving Johnny Manziel and Texas A&M, and I’m sure as aggravated as we are about the sanctions, the sports world is just as sick of hearing ’SC fans complain about them.
But there’s really no rational way for the NCAA to defend the sanctions it imposed against USC, as the organization is so clearly inconsistent. The NCAA thought they could fight the issue and make an example of USC. But coaches still push the boundaries on recruiting rules, and they always will. There’s nothing the NCAA can do to stop it without crippling the hugely successful financial asset of college football.
The Penn State concession makes the current treatment of USC even more maddening. And even though reports are now coming out that Haden met with the NCAA in Indianapolis this week, it’s hard to say if the Trojans will actually have their sanctions cut short, especially after NCAA President Mark Emmert stated that the softened stance in Happy Valley was not setting a precedent to reduce penalties for schools that showed a certain amount of compliance.
Much like Penn State’s football program, USC has done a lot to clean up a past of which Trojan fans shouldn’t feel that proud of. The problem wasn’t the program itself but certain members of the program — so USC cleaned house and brought in a much more responsible group of athletic department administrators, led by Athletic Director Pat Haden.
Haden has taken the sanctions in stride and has kept a much tighter leash on the football program’s recruiting process, making Trojan fans like myself proud of the program again — even after that shameful Washington State game.
The only issue within USC’s athletic program that the NCAA could point to as a potential lack of compliance since the sanctions would be the issues surrounding former baseball coach Frank Cruz. He called for more practices than allowed by NCAA rules and was quickly fired by Haden following the investigation. Not only did USC quickly resolve the issue, but it had nothing to do with football.
There are some mild grievances one might have with the way head coach Lane Kiffin altered the football program since taking over, such as deflating opponents’ footballs or changing jerseys during games to gain an advantage over competition, but stuff like that is much more like gamesmanship than cheating.
I guess the only positive takeaway for Trojan fans is that the reduction of Penn State’s sanctions might be the start of the NCAA recognizing the instability of their agreements with football players.
Many call for players to receive pay. I think they already do with their full-ride scholarships, but players should be able to sell stuff like their autographs on the open market like any other service.
The concession the NCAA just made isn’t much, and in my opinion, college players are years, if not decades away from getting paid to play sports in college. But any evidence of rationality from the tyrannical NCAA is a good sign for the future.
So don’t be discouraged by the Penn State news like I initially was. Keep believing in the Trojans we’ll have on the field tomorrow in Tempe for a potential Pac-12 South elimination game, have faith in the future of our program with a fully fielded roster and be proud of how compliant the Trojans have been with the sanctions.
And keep holding out hope for a day when the NCAA doesn’t rule the game we all love.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden and Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts met with National Collegiate Athletic Association President Mark Emmert on Wednesday following the NCAA’s announcement that it would reduce sanctions against Penn State.
“After learning of the NCAA’s actions on Tuesday regarding Penn State and the lessening of the sanctions that were imposed on that institution, when viewed in the context of the events that have shaken intercollegiate athletics over the past year, we felt compelled to discuss USC’s sanctions in a new light,” Haden said in a statement.
The Penn State sanctions, which were instated as a consequence of the scandal surrounding former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, previously capped the university’s 2014 student-athlete scholarships to 65 scholarships. However, the NCAA announced Tuesday that the scholarship cap would be increased to 75 scholarships in 2014, 80 in 2015 and return to the full allotment of 85 scholarships by 2016, according to ESPN.

The meetings focused on enforcement and sanction issues, specifically with regards to how to come up with fair solutions for both USC and the NCAA community.
“After candid discussions, the NCAA asked us to provide additional information and indicated it would study our suggestions,” Haden said.
USC’s sanctions came as a result of the 2010 Reggie Bush case, and  reduced the total football scholarship limit from 85 scholarships to 75 annual scholarships. Haden noted, however, that football players who were injured or transferred left the Trojans with less than 60 recruited scholarship student-athletes.
“I believe the penalties imposed on our football program in 2010 were unprecedented and inconsistent with NCAA precedent in prior cases,” Haden said. “Since the Committee on Infractions issued its sanctions in 2010, USC has been held up as a model and praised for its integrity and commitment to compliance, a fact often mentioned by the NCAA itself.”
THE D.T. IS A FARCE OF FREE SPEECH. YOU GUYS/GALS SHOULD WORK FOR THE CHINESE–YOUR CENSORSHIP/NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS POLICY IS OUTRAGEOUSLY ANTI-DEMOCRATIC, AND ANTI-AMERICAN. NO GROWTH WILL EVER OCCUR AT THE DT WITH YOUR RUNNING SCARRED ASS-KISSING ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ADMINISTRATION. JUST CHANGE THE NEWSPAPERS NAME TO THE DAILY BROWN NOSER! PATHETIC!
Haden was not there to discuss the Sanctions. This meeting was set months ago. The PSU sanction reduction forced Haden to re-address the issue, for which he was totally unprepared. He thinks we actually deserve the sanctions–that’s why he has not mitigated them, while every other university has. Haden has accepted our lot, firmly believing that enduring this unjust punishment is part of our redemption–kind of like saying your “Hail Mary’s”. HIs personal morality seems to trump his obligations as the A.D..

As USC heads to Tempe, Ariz. to take on Arizona State in a pivotal matchup between Pac-12 South foes, the question surrounding the team is the same as it’s been throughout the entire season — can the Trojans’ offense finally hit its stride and match the play of its dominant defense?
The answer to that question will likely determine the outcome of Saturday’s game, and maybe even the team’s entire season. If the Trojans lose, they would fall to 0-2 in conference play, leaving them in a rather sizeable hole to dig themselves out of if they want to contend for the division championship.
“We feel good. Obviously we don’t look at it that way,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “We don’t think we’re going to play to be 0-2; we’re going to play to be 4-1. We look forward to the challenge of going against a very talented, well-coached team.”

Against Arizona State, the key for the USC offense will be to hold its own against an extremely active Sun Devil front seven. ASU features two pass rushing stalwarts in defensive tackle Will Sutton and linebacker Carl Bradford, both of whom finished 2012 in the nation’s top 15 in sacks.
“They’re very aggressive and [use] multiple fronts,” Kiffin said. “As far as blitz packages, they bring the linebackers a lot. [Bradford] is a really great player in coverage and in rushing. He gave us a lot of issues last year. They can be a dominant defense, which we saw last year.”
The Trojans’ offensive line will have to play its best game, particularly in pass protection, for the rest of the offense to thrive. Against Utah State, USC allowed three sacks, including one allowed by redshirt freshman offensive tackle Chad Wheeler that resulted in a fumble.
“He’s young, but I think Chad has done a really good job,” Kiffin said. “Left tackle is a position where, a lot of times, you don’t notice [the player] until something goes wrong. He got beat for the sack-caused fumble, so I’m sure a lot of people noticed that. But there’s a lot of plays in there … where he’s holding his own. We’re excited about his continuing development as a freshman.”
As for redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, he and the USC receivers are still in the process of establishing a rhythm. After completing a sizzling 15 of 17 passes against Boston College, he was 13 for 27 against Utah State.
Kessler and the passing game particularly struggled in the fourth quarter, going 0 for 6 on his pass attempts and failing to help the offense capitalize on good field position several times. Kiffin has stressed that Kessler needs to distribute the ball more evenly between his plethora of playmakers, particularly his tight ends — redshirt juniors Randall Telfer and Xavier Grimble have combined for just 10 catches and one touchdown this season.
“As you can tell, Randall has been battling in there,” Kiffin said. “He has not been at full strength in games. We’ve been trying to get the ball more to Xavier. He scored a touchdown last week, and has been doing some good things. [Redshirt sophomore tailback] Tre [Madden] is our third-leading receiver, so we’re trying to get the ball around more and utilize our healthy guys.”
Madden and redshirt tailback Justin Davis have been integral for the Trojan offense, averaging a combined 151 rushing yards per game. Saturday might signal the return of senior tailback Silas Redd, who has missed the entire season while recovering from knee surgery.
Kiffin said he was hopeful Redd would play against ASU, and even Redd’s main competition at tailback hopes the senior will return soon.
“I’m definitely looking forward to Silas coming back,” Madden said. “He’s a great talent, and a great leader on our offense.”
The Trojans will continue to rely on its front seven against ASU’s offense. USC leads the nation in tackles for loss and is second in sacks.
Putting pressure on ASU quarterback Taylor Kelly will be critical, as Kelly was ranked No. 9 in the country in passer rating in 2012.
One of the key matchups for the USC defense will be its secondary against ASU wide receiver Jaelen Strong, a junior college transfer in his first year at ASU. Strong leads the team with 24 catches for 330 yards and two touchdowns. At 6-foot-4, 205 lbs., Strong presents a physical mismatch for the Trojans, who don’t have a cornerback on their roster listed taller than 6-foot-1.
On the ground, the Sun Devils are led by tailback Marion Grice, who leads the nation in touchdowns this season with eight scores.
The last time USC visited Tempe, the Trojans struggled mightily in the second half, giving up 22 unanswered points in a 43-22 loss. The fans at Sun Devil Stadium were raucous and gave the Trojans fits on offense. Crowd noise could be an even bigger hindrance for a USC offense that features several inexperienced players.
“I’m just gonna be there for my guys as much as possible,” junior center and team captain Marcus Martin said. “I’m just gonna give as much support as I can and try to keep them focused. [You] can’t worry about the crowd noise, just worry about executing each play, and have fun with your brothers.”
Kickoff for Saturday’s game is set for 7:30 p.m. The game will be broadcast on ESPN2.

Where, in the middle of one of the biggest United States cities, can one find celebrity chefs, five-star authentic Thai food and plenty of fun all in one place?

Known for his appearances on Iron Chef America, Chopped and No Reservations and his three Guinness World Records, celebrity chef and USC alumnus Jet Tila is bringing his expertise in Thai cuisine to Los Angeles this weekend at the first annual L.A. Thai Food Festival.
“I grew up with a passion for Thai food,” said Tila, a third generation immigrant from Thailand living in Los Angeles. “And I sat down one day and I said, ‘There’s got to be a way to make it available [to more people].’”
He took his idea for a Thai-centered food festival straight to the top and asked the Thai Consulate General for help with bringing authentic Thai food from different regions of the country to the United States.
This Sunday, Tila is hosting the inaugural Thai Food Festival. Titled BKK 2 LAX, the festival will feature culinary discussion panels, celebrity chef demonstrations, food and drink tasting and live entertainment.
The event, inspired by Tila’s passion for modern Asian and pan-Asian cuisine, is organized primarily by the Thai Trade Center Los Angeles, in partnership with the Royal Thai Consulate General, Tourism Authority of Thailand, Board of Investment, Agricultural Office and Thai Airways.
General admission guests will get an opportunity to see Tila present his “five fundamental flavors of yum,” which are sweet, spicy, sour, salty and bitter.
In addition to food booths and demonstrations, the festival will feature Muay Thai martial art demonstrations, Thai classical and folk dancing, traditional Thai umbrella painting, and fruit carving.
Tila is most excited to see the diverse collection of Thai dishes and chefs all in one place during the festival.
“This is the only time and the only place ever where Andy Ricker [a celebrity chef from Portland, Ore.] and my Thai grandmother … will be cooking authentic Thai food in booths right next to each other,” Tila said.
Tila chose Los Angeles to host the festival not only because of his personal connections to the area, but because it is considered the “77th province” of Thailand. Los Angeles is home to approximately 80,000 of the 120,000 total Thais in California, making it home to the largest population outside of Thailand. Los Angeles also boasts the first “Thai Town,” a neighborhood located in East Hollywood. Tila, himself, is a third generation restaurateur in Los Angeles, which is home to the best Thai restaurants in America.
In May, former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa presented Tila with the Dream of Los Angeles Award for “igniting a renewed interest in Pan-Asian cuisine through dedication to his Thai and Chinese roots, and his passion for the culinary arts in and outside the kitchen.” Tila also organizes and leads intimate “melting pot tours” of Thai Town, during which he reveals his favorite neighborhood gems to a small group of food lovers.
Tila was the first chef to bring Thai cuisine to the U.S. on a large scale. He has since appeared on dozens of episodes of various cooking shows and also opened the restaurant Wazuzu at the Wynn Las Vegas, in partnership with Compass Group, the world’s largest food service corporation. He is best known for his signature “drunken noodles,” a stir fried noodle dish made with broad rice noodles, soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic, meat, seafood, bean sprouts and vegetables. Tila’s drunken noodles became famous on a national scale when celebrity chef Giada DiLaurentis visited his Las Vegas restaurant and appeared on an episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate, naming Tila’s drunken noodles as her favorite dish.
Festival guests will have the opportunity to try his handmade khao soi, a curry noodle dish similar to Tila’s signature drunken noodles. Though drunken noodles are his best-known dish, Tila says his favorite thing to cook is “any meal [he] can enjoy with friends and family … no one dish takes the cake.”
Tila holds three food-related records in the Guinness Book of World Records, including the largest stir fry at 4010 lbs., the largest seafood stew at 6656 lbs. and the longest California roll at 422 feet.
As for aspiring chefs, Tila’s advice is to first get a degree from the Marshall School of Business.
“No B.S., this takes a lot more than cooking,” Tila said.
Festival visitors receive general admission passes for $50, giving them full access to the festival from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. For an extra $25, VIP visitors will receive preferred parking and early access.

This weekend marks the release of Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s directorial and writing debut and the latest in a long line of movies directed by established actors. It happens pretty often. After a while, an established actor can get the itch to try their hand at working on the other side of the camera (though not necessarily relinquishing their role in front of it). This leads to varying results. For every actor that finds success in this leap, there are five who stop after their first attempt. Sure, there are some fantastic actors-turned-directors out there. Clint Eastwood has easily made the most successful transition but others such as Ron Howard and, recently, Ben Affleck have also found great success. In fact, six actors have gone on to win Academy  Awards for best director (Eastwood did it twice) and seven such films have won best picture, all in the last 33 years (with Argo taking the most recent one last year). The list of supremely talented actors who directed once and stopped, however, is staggering — Marlon Brando, Douglas Fairbanks, Dustin Hoffman, Bill Murray, the list goes on and on. Needless to say, the jump is far from a sure thing.

The strongest criticism of this practice is that these actors receive the opportunity to direct out of their already-established fame, beating out aspiring directors who are possibly more talented but less well-known. This is almost certainly valid, as there were probably more talented alternatives for some of these films. Or, in an extension of this idea, there were probably better film alternatives to be made over some of the passion projects that established actors got green-lit through their stature. The mere fact that it is a George Clooney or a Ryan Gosling pitching a movie means, at the very least, that more meetings will be scheduled and more opportunities will be available. This ample selection of opportunities goes a long way to explain why so many actors get to make these movies.
Perhaps this also goes a long way in explaining the large success some of these films have had at the Academy Awards. Certainly, all seven of the films that won were great films, but it is curious that two of them are often cited amongst the biggest Oscar mistakes (Ordinary People winning over Raging Bull and Dances With Wolves beating Goodfellas). Isn’t it possible that the fact that these were the directorial debuts of movie superstars Robert Redford and Kevin Costner respectively helped the cause of the films in the eyes of the voters? Perhaps it didn’t help to the extent that the fact swayed the voters by itself, but instead just enough so as to tip the scales against much grittier Scorsese efforts. This is not to say that Oscar success is a reliable measure of film quality, nor that the two films were not really good, but it certainly seems that the two directors’ star power gave their films a push.
That’s at the center of all of this: star power. The more fame an actor has, the easier it is to get a film done or noticed. Beyond this, the more star power an actor has, the bigger his or her ego is liable to be. Meaning, simply, that it is all the more likely that they think they can do anything. If that is a common mentality going into productions, then it would certainly explain the large number of one-and-dones as these actors realize just how draining and difficult the directorial position can be. Naturally, an actor being very famous is not necessarily an indicator that a film will be bad or that they will go into a production with incorrect expectations. In fact, for certain actors, it can be quite the opposite. Think about it: The bigger a star a particular actor is, the more screen time they occupy. The more screen time an actor occupies generally means the more time they are around the set. This, in turn, means that there is a directly proportional link between the brightness of an actor’s stardom and the experience they have around a director. In the right hands, this can effectively be an actor’s equivalent of film school, picking up all sorts of tricks of the trade. Sure, there has to be talent there, but the experience that can be gained is invaluable, and where gaps remain, their associations with famous directors can help to fill them. Gordon-Levitt has talked about the large amount of help that director Christopher Nolan (the two worked together on both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) gave him in the production of Don Jon.
If all the ingredients come together the right way, an actor can do wonderful things for himself. Eastwood, taking the tools he learned from masters such as Sergio Leone and his own experience as an actor, reinvented himself from an action star into a nuanced director who could get great performances out of his actors through his connection to them as a fellow actor. Affleck and Howard revitalized their careers in similar ways. If Gordon-Levitt mixes all his ingredients properly, this could be the beginning of another success story. We’ll just have to wait and see.

The concept for Rush is immediately intriguing: a dramatic movie about racecar drivers. Directed by Ron Howard, it seemed the film would look away from the recent focus of car-heavy films such as The Fast and the Furious and instead focus on the psychologies and personal lives of the drivers putting themselves at risk by driving cars in a circle at 170 miles per hour for a living. It certainly focuses on this aspect just as much as, if not more than, the races themselves, and it would have been difficult to find a story in driving history more suited for this purpose.
Crossing the finish line · The Ron Howard-directed Rush takes a different approach to the racing film genre, choosing to emphasize the psychology behind Formula 1 drivers while also including thrilling racing scenes. – Courtesy of NBC Universal
 
Based on a true story surrounding the 1976 Formula 1 season, the film focuses on the rivalry between two of the sport’s then pre-eminent drivers: James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Hunt is a brash, womanizing Englishman played by Chris Hemsworth, and Lauda is a pragmatic and blunt Austrian driver played by Daniel Brühl. The audience sees their rise from ambitious young drivers on the Formula 3 circuit up to a contentious battle for the 1976 World Championship. Hunt is full of joie de vivre and daring, regularly risking his life for the chance to win. His character embodies the epitome of the movie super-driver. Lauda, on the other hand, says in the film that he’d be doing something else if he could make more money at it. He is all business all the time at the expense of any risk-taking or social courtesies. These character traits are bent in the pursuit of beating one another.
Hemsworth, best known for his turn as Thor in The Avengers, graces most of the movie’s publicity material. His character’s playboy antics only shine a light on his undeniable movie-star appeal. Hemsworth shows off acting chops he hasn’t really needed before as his character Hunt begins to struggle to maintain relationships and the pressure to keep up with the metronomic and relentless Lauda. And while Hunt spends most of the film frolicking with beautiful women and drinking, the character has a certain amount of complexity — and Hemsworth’s portrayal doesn’t disappoint.
The role of Lauda is trickier. The Austrian is prickly and the accident leaves him scarred. Brühl is the much more established actor in terms of dramatic roles and handles the job very well. His attempts to replicate Lauda’s Austrian accent, however, are a bit jarring. Brühl is German but can speak English quite well. Unfortunately, the accent makes his speech come out robotic at times, and it overshadows other great aspects of his performance.
For a film so focused on what happens off the track, it certainly managed to pack a lot of punch whenever it actually got to the races. The film uses original camera placements, visual effects and sharp editing to give a racing experience that is very different from the car-centric films that seem to grow more stale with every sequel. Every shot seems doubly intended to recreate both the exhilaration of going at intense speeds and the sobering reality of how quick a driver’s reaction time has to be to pull it off. The shaking, swerving and, most of all, blurring that occurs as drivers evade walls and other “bombs on wheels,” as the film calls them, is equal parts terrifying and exciting.
Seen on the big screen, the racing scenes are enthralling, especially when they are given extended time as opposed to the slightly dissatisfying race snippets that occupy most of the movie. It would be very interesting to see what Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle would do with a film focused more on the driving itself, as these scenes would not only not feel out of place in a more action-focused car movie, but would provide more thrills than the tired car chases that have become a staple of action cinema.
But it’s certainly understandable why Howard used so few of these scenes. Rush favors focusing on the drivers over the driving, and there’s a constant comparison and contrast between the two main characters. The film’s comparatively framed narrative is elegantly done, and manages to draw out the spirit of competition and also delve into the psychology of competitors simultaneously.
One major misstep comes after the climax of the movie. There is a scene where the two protagonists run into each other and essentially sum up the characters’ differences, and what one learned about the other. Frankly, this is rather clumsy way to end the movie — for a film that worked so hard to show the lives of these characters, having them come out and tell us the point of the movie was more than a bit awkward.
Aside from the ending, Rush was great at what it set out to do. It gave a glimpse into the psyches of these two very connected rivals while capitalizing on the excitement and drama that a Formula 1 movie has the potential for. And for viewers who are expecting an octane-filled adrenaline fest and a thought-provoking thriller, Rush ultimately crosses the finish line.

An old joke goes that Americans have three neighbors: Canadians, Mexicans and fish. When thinking about why Americans are notoriously lethargic towards learning foreign languages, I wonder if this might have something to do with it.
That being said, I believe it is imperative that USC begin offering an Indonesian language program to its students. Doing so will provide our student body with a language skill that will uniquely benefit them in the global marketplace commercially, diplomatically and culturally.
Why would students want to engage with Indonesia? From a commercial perspective, it is the place to be. The largest country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has the fourth largest population in the world — nearly a quarter of a billion people live there. The economy is growing at roughly 6 percent per year. Standard Chartered Bank forecasts that Indonesia could become one of the world’s top ten economies by 2020 and top six by 2030. From a business viewpoint, Indonesia is rapidly gaining economic prominence.
So, the country is big. And still, why should USC offer the language to its students? We need to do so to solidify our place as the dominant university in the United States’ pivot to the Pacific. Columbia, Cornell and Yale have already joined forces to offer Indonesian lessons via two-way video conferencing. If we do not initiate a program of our own, we risk getting left behind.
The benefits for Indonesian speakers are not just limited to the private sector. Diplomatic opportunities also abound. The U.S. federal government lists Indonesian as a critical language, one with a large professional demand and a limited supply. Because Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country in the world, there is considerable government interest in maintaining strong relations with the Indonesian people. Breaking the language barrier is the first step toward this goal.
Moreover, there is already an enormous USC presence in Indonesia. The groundwork has been laid for non-Indonesian Trojans to enter the country. The alumni club there is one of the most active in the world — as is the USC Association of Indonesian Students on campus.
Pragmatically minded students should, view Indonesian lessons as a low-risk, high-reward investment — especially compared to the much more arduous Chinese language. The U.S. Foreign Service Institute ranks Indonesian as three times easier for English speakers than Mandarin.
Culturally, students of Indonesian will benefit from access to a region otherwise little known in the U.S. Compared to the U.S., Indonesia is an entirely new world — 3,000 kilometers of islands stretching across the equator. Whether doing business in Jakarta or relaxing on the beach in Bali, Indonesia has strong appeal.
Language ability would make working there very feasible, not to mention being an attractive trait for those aspiring to work in neighboring Singapore.
Providing Indonesian lessons will give USC students the competitive advantage they need in Southeast Asia. With a robust East Asian languages program already in place, providing a Southeast Asian language is a sure-shot investment in the student body’s global capabilities. From a diplomatic, business and cultural standpoint, Indonesian is the strategic next move for USC’s international focus. Move over China: There’s a new player in town.

I love this.  Exactly what I have been thinking. Thanks to Matthew to put it nicely… Bravo Matt…
Such an ignorant comment. It is taught at UCLA.
Honestly, if the language is not taught at USC, you probably shouldn’t be learning it

According to The New York Times, the current generation of college students is the largest group of mixed race people in America so far. The number of individuals who identified as mixed race is at 9 million. Increasingly more Americans find themselves in a gray area when it comes to defining their races. You might have heard of “Hapas” — people of partially Asian/Pacific Islander ancestry — or “Blasians,” people of mixed black and Asian ancestry. Though these types of self-identification are becoming more common in everyday language, a conflict arises when the standard “Check the box” race forms can’t properly identify a growing population of Americans. Most people do not cleanly fit into the four standard racial categories of black, white, American Indian or Pacific Islander.
Theodore Park | Daily Trojan
 
The  problem with racial identification lies in faulty methods of collecting data about such groups. Questions of race in the United States have always been a particularly sensitive topic. With its peculiar mix of European colonists, American Indians and Spanish and French explorers, the U.S. has always struggled with race relations. In an effort to better resolve and address race questions in the modern era, the federal Office of Management and Budget has issued Directive No. 15. According to the official White House website, this directive “requires compilation of data for four racial categories (White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander), and an ethnic category to indicate Hispanic origin, or not of Hispanic origin.” And  here is the problem: A person is now forced to identify him or herself as one of only four races even though changing demographics show that there are more possibilities.
The idea that a person’s race is easily classifiable is flawed. For instance, the recent beating of  Prabhjot Singh, a professor at Columbia University, shows the problems that arise from an ill-informed populace. According to the New York Daily News, Singh, who is an Indian-American Sikh, was mistaken for being Muslim due to his turban and beard. He stated that the thugs who broke his jaw “acted out of ignorance.” Clearly, a couple of boxes on a form are not responsible for racism in the United States. But race questions with such limited answers are a tangible manifestation of a failure to recognize and validate America’s growing diversity.
As an Indian-American, Singh doesn’t fit into any of the four most common answers to demographic questions. He’s certainly not white, black or American Indian. He might be considered Asian for the purposes of the geography, but in common language, “Asian” usually denotes a person of East Asian heritage.
The question is even more complicated when one considers that in the United Kingdom, an “Asian person” is one from South Asia or the Middle East, and East Asians are usually called “Oriental,” a term that is no longer in polite usage in the U.S. Even if Singh were Middle-Eastern, he runs into the same issue.  Middle-Eastern Americans might not be considered “white” by most people. Yet, according to federal guidelines, people of Middle-Eastern descent are in fact “white.” But why? Undoubtedly, Middle Eastern Americans are not “white” because of their culture, skin color or religion, though they might share some of these aspects with other “white” Americans. For the most part, “white” seems a dreadfully inadequate term to describe someone from the Middle East, North Africa or Eastern Europe.
It’s important to note that in recent years, federal agencies have taken more proactive steps in identifying Americans of different racial backgrounds. Their approach, however, leaves much to be desired. According to the official Census Bureau website, the last two censuses have included more detailed options to identify a respondent’s race. The standard categories of white, black and American Indian are included, but there are further options to classify what kind of “Asian” a respondent is. These options include Asian Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, among others. Yet, what of Middle Eastern Americans? As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the same options exist for Asian identification, leaving some individuals to again identify as “white,” though a write-in category does exist. People from African or European countries are similarly left in the dark about how the U.S. government classifies them. Do the terms “black,” “African American” or “white” really explain their identities?
This lack of identification exacerbates the problem of racism and a lack of cultural knowledge. Perhaps an infamous Mean Girls quote best explains the situation. As Karen Smith asked, “If you’re from Africa, why are you white?” Sadly, with current controversies surrounding racism and racial identification in the U.S., it seems unfair to blame Karen for her lack of knowledge.
Though it would be a ludicrous to attempt to list every possible race, a simple addition of “Middle Eastern,” for example, does not seem an unfair request. Though such racial classifications may not seem important, they permeate many aspects of adult life. From college applications and the complicated questions of affirmative action, to the Department of Labor’s requirement that employers collect demographic data, it’s clear that race is an issue in America. It would be nice if the government made these classifications more applicable to most Americans. In an increasingly diverse society, last century’s racial classifications risk becoming obsolete as people identify themselves in different ways.

All notions of racial superiority rest on the myth that the most “superior” of the alleged “races” must be “pure” and unmixed with the other “races.”  Destroy the myth that “white” equals “pure” (multiracial whiteness) and you have effectively destroyed racism:
How is it useful to divide people into racial groups? It sets up an artificial competition between groups for limited government provided assistance when our nation was built to respect the rights of individuals.
I must commend the author on an extremely well written article. The author makes many good points and it truly can be argued whether or not the surveying is properly defined. It really comes down to what is the purpose of the survey discussed here. I must believe that the survey preparers were and still are overwhelmed with the possible number of boxes and the confusion it may generate with a good portion of the population. I surmise that they decided to categorize at major group levels for simplicity, perhaps over-simplified. This was likely suffice for their needs based on budget constraints or driven by other factors. More importantly, it is the relationships that we the United States carry with the rest of the world. The relationships built via our State Department is where it really counts given your concerns. This area of Government is where they spend the time to learn about the differences between our customs, religions, beliefs, etc across the globe. You may want to take a look at the State Dept website if you haven’t already and truly examine the efforts taken to work with the masses. It is very hard work and requires those most capable to do it. I would want to educate and ensure people are cognizant and not boxed in to believe the entire US Government thinks the same way. Lastly, we must remember both sides are important, which is what makes this country so great.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden and Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts met with National Collegiate Athletic Association President Mark Emmert Wednesday following the NCAA’s announcement that it would reduce sanctions against Penn State.
“After learning of the NCAA’s actions on Tuesday regarding Penn State and the lessening of the sanctions that were imposed on that institution, when viewed in the context of the events that have shaken intercollegiate athletics over the past year, we felt compelled to discuss USC’s sanctions in a new light,” Haden said in a statement.
The Penn State sanctions, which were instated as a consequence of the scandal surrounding former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, previously capped the university’s 2014 student-athlete scholarships to 65 scholarships. However, the NCAA announced Tuesday that the scholarship cap would be increased to 75 scholarships in 2014, 80 in 2015 and return to the full allotment of 85 scholarships by 2016, according to ESPN.
The meetings focused on enforcement and sanction issues, specifically in regards to how to come up with fair solutions for both USC and the NCAA community.
“After candid discussions, the NCAA asked us to provide additional information and indicated it would study our suggestions,” Haden said.
USC’s sanctions came as a result of the 2010 Reggie Bush case, and  reduced the total football scholarship limit from 85 scholarships to 75 annual scholarships. However, Haden noted that football players who were injured or transferred left the Trojans with less than 60 recruited scholarship student-athletes.
“I believe the penalties imposed on our football program in 2010 were unprecedented and inconsistent with NCAA precedent in prior cases,” Haden said. “Since the Committee on Infractions issued its sanctions in 2010, USC has been held up as a model and praised for its integrity and commitment to compliance, a fact often mentioned by the NCAA itself.”

The NCAA Nazis imposed outrageous sanctions on USC.  No one associated with USC knew anything about the infractions – it was one student and his parents and no one else from USC was involved.  So the NCAAs solution for something that USC knew nothing about was to try their best to destroy the preeminent college football program in the nation and to deny 30 young people a college education?  In addition to that, their solution also was to punish a group of current USC football player who were about 8 to 10 years old when the infractions occurred.  The NCAA is a criminal enterprise.  A bunch of 300 lb. college linemen ought to go into NCAA HQ and kick the sh*t out of them.
