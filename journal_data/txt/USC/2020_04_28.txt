My friends, the end is finally here. 
Many readers (and by many I mean my dad), would call this the end of an era. For 16 weeks, I have put my blood, sweat and tears into “The State of Play.” Unfortunately, all good things in life — and in the case of my column, unfailingly mediocre things — must come to an end, and that is where we are today. 
So, considering that this will likely be my last opportunity to spout off for the umpteenth time about why politics and sports intersect, I’d like to write a recap of sorts. After writing this column, I can confidently say that it’s taught me a lot. 
For one, it’s taught me that Chicago Bears fans are the biggest snowflakes that NFL fandom has to offer — I’m looking directly at you, Steven — and it’s also taught me that a lot of the higher ups in professional sports are a bunch of feckless bastards, though I’ll admit that I probably already knew that, to an extent. 
Perhaps more than anything else, however, it’s taught me that we actually have quite a lot to learn from sports, more than even I realized despite my card-carrying status as a sports fanatic and wannabe political theorist. 
So with that being said, here are my two biggest takeaways from the semester. 
For the last time, sports and politics cannot be separated.
I’ve heard enough of this: 
“Keep your lib-tard sensibilities off of my gameday,” said a hypothetical but incredibly accurate portrait of a generic sports fan that I just created. “Sports and politics mix just as well as Cosmopolitan Magazine mixes with my raised Ford Super Duty.” 
I’ve heard statements like this countless times. You’ve heard countless statements like this. We’ve all heard countless statements like this, and despite mounting evidence to disprove said statements, people continue to believe that sports and politics do not belong in the same conversation. 
Because this false belief continues to manifest itself in the hearts and minds of sports fans everywhere, I’m going to try to dispel it one last time. Politics and sports intersect, and should intersect, in more ways than I can count. 
Just think back on Colin Kaepernick, North Korea at the Winter Olympics, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s Twitter beef with the People’s Republic of China. Even today, we’re witnessing how a lack of government preparedness and leadership can lead to the cancellation of the sports world as we know it. I got plenty more examples where that came from, but I’ll spare you. 
OK, so you accept the reality that sports and politics intersect, but should they? Should Kaepernick take a knee during the national anthem and should LeBron James express his political views?
Listen, sports are how we pass on and instill American values. They’re part of how we teach our society about hard work, fairness and respect. I think we can all agree on that, no matter what kind of car you drive or what cable news network you watch. 
The point I’m trying to make here is that you can’t preach integrity and perseverance to your kid’s Little League team if every time an athlete talks about equality, you throw a fit and turn the game off. 
Sports fans and American society are still different in one fundamental way.
Stupidity and failure.
No, I’m not talking about the working title of my pending autobiography. I’m talking about the two things sports fans still never tolerate. 
In sports, drop a couple of passes or hold your team back and you will find your ass on the bench. Lead your team to a losing record and every fan within a 3,500-mile radius of you will repay you with an all-American “fuck you” and pray for your unemployment. 
USC won the Pac-12 Championship in 2017 and I still considered the season a failure. Clay Helton won eight games last year while playing a backup true freshman at quarterback for the majority of the season. When it was announced that Helton would be back for another go-around, I think a part of the Trojan Family died. 
This is because, for better or for worse, fans still value success. They still care about winning, and they care about the people in charge of their teams winning. Hire a schmuck to take over any college or professional franchise and they’ll have the guy tarred and feathered over social media before the hiring is even made official. 
Unfortunately, in American politics, the same principles sports fans adhere to do not apply. Commit a crime against American democracy and your buddies in the Senate will sacrifice every shred of their dignity to make sure you make it through a trial scot-free. Tell Americans to inject themselves with disinfectant and … well … it looks like Fox News is still working on cleaning that mess up. 
What I’m saying is that in sports, unlike in politics, you can’t pull a fast one over your fans. Whether it’s on the field or on the court, failure and incompetence are on display for all to see, and no amount of bullshit will ever cover it up. 
For that reason alone, it looks like Americans still have a lot to learn from sports.

If you ask USC sports fans about the current state of the University’s athletics programs, you are likely to get a range of answers from “never been better” to “never been worse.”
Some might point to USC’s 19 national championships across seven different programs in the last decade. Thirteen out of 15 teams with record-based head-to-head schedules finished the 2019-20 year with a winning season.
Others might point to the facts that USC football has not made an appearance in the national championship game since 2006 and the men’s basketball team has not advanced past the second round of the NCAA Tournament since 2007. What’s more, the athletic department was at the center of the infamous 2019 college admissions scandal that shocked students and families on campus and across the nation.
So when former USC football star Lynn Swann resigned from his position as the University’s athletic director Sept. 9, it brought in an opportunity for newly appointed President Carol Folt to bring in a breath of fresh air.
Nearly two months later at a John McKay Center press conference, Folt introduced a new figure that she said was “known for his integrity, his competitiveness, his passion and for always placing students at the center of his work.”
A man soon towered over the podium donning a tie with the familiar cardinal and gold colors that matched the backdrop behind him. With his tall frame and booming voice, the words “Good morning!” struck reporters and viewers throughout the room.
Mike Bohn was introduced as USC’s newest athletic director and wasted no time sending the message that the standard for success for coaches, potential recruits and student-athletes on and off the field would be of national championship caliber, a sentiment he has stressed throughout his almost six-month tenure as athletic director.
He attributes this win-first approach to his early upbringing in Boulder, Colo. and his passion for sports from a young age. The son of a single physical education teacher, his mother Marlyn, Bohn has been surrounded by sports for as long as he can remember. His early reading content was largely sports-related — to the slight dismay of his teachers — and he and his two brothers would push furniture to the walls of their childhood living room to play tackle football when their mother was out of the house.
As the captain of three teams in high school, Bohn won multiple state championships and received the opportunity to further his career at the University of Kansas.
“My high school years were really [formative],” Bohn said. “My favorite season was the season we were in: If it was football season, it was football; if it was basketball season, it was basketball; if it was baseball season, it was baseball.”
Bohn claims to have hit .258 on the Jayhawks’ baseball team and played alongside future NFL players Frank Seurer, E.J. Jones, Bob Johnson, Wayne Capers and Sylvester Byrd as a backup quarterback on the school’s 1982 football roster.
“I didn’t play a whole lot, but I never missed a practice and was proud of that and proud to be part of a team around a great group of guys and some wonderful coaches,” Bohn said.
At Kansas, Bohn developed a relationship with current Marshall University athletic director Mike Hamrick, who worked in the Jayhawks’ sports marketing department. One day in 1983, Hamrick asked Bohn about his plans for the future. Puzzled at first, Bohn responded by saying he’d be satisfied to work in collegiate athletics. Hamrick helped Bohn secure an interview at Ohio University for the chance to obtain his master’s in sports administration.
Hamrick’s willingness to help Bohn find his way seems to be reflected in how the former two-sport college athlete approaches his job today.
“I think what I really like about him all the time is he goes, ‘If you need anything, ask. I’m here to help,’” new USC women’s volleyball head coach Brad Keller said of Bohn. “Everything that he talks about has to do with [the student-athlete experience]. I think whatever he says he’s going to do, he’s going to do it.”
The search to fill Swann’s position was unique in its inclusion of direct input from student-athletes, as senior track and field hurdler Anna Cockrell and junior football safety Talanoa Hufanga were selected to be on the University’s search committee for USC’s new athletic director.
“We were looking for someone who had proven experience, who had done this before at this level or a level comparable to the one that USC and the Pac-12 is on,” Cockrell said. “We were looking for integrity, honesty, success and for someone who was willing to listen and someone who was willing to be a team player because athletics isn’t on its own island, it’s part of the University.”
Hufanga was particularly impressed by Bohn’s candid nature upon first meeting him.
“I really enjoyed just meeting him in person and seeing what he was really all about,” Hufanga said. “I could tell that it was genuine. I know he wasn’t here to just come in [for] the bright lights and stuff. He really wanted us to make a change, and he’s willing to do whatever it takes.”
Bohn’s resume in college athletic departments is nothing short of full: He handled fundraising and corporate sponsorships at the Air Force Academy, dealt with television rights for several collegiate conferences at the College Football Association, guided the University of Idaho’s football program to what is now the Football Bowl Subdivision, increased fan attendance at San Diego State University sporting events, moved the football team at Colorado into the Pac-12 Conference and improved multiple facets of the University of Cincinnati’s athletic department.
Bohn stepped in as the athletic director for San Diego State in 2003 and for Colorado in 2005 at times when both universities were recovering from scandals of their own. His ability to help the two schools recover from those controversies was rumored to be a deciding factor in USC’s hiring decision.
“I don’t know why I seem to be drawn to big challenges and recognizing the optimistic piece of being able to make a difference and to improve the operation quickly with a lot of positivity and energy and experience,” Bohn said. “That’s the business, though. The good jobs that are open are generally [open] because something happened, something went wrong.”
Since 1984, every USC athletic director before Bohn had a previous tie to the University. Despite this, Bohn had his eye set on USC’s athletic director position for quite a while.
“I’ve had the USC fight song on my playlist since I was a kid and grew up loving following USC,” Bohn said. “We have so many wonderful Trojans around us that support us and guide us and give us history and insights into things that happen and went on, so I never felt like an outsider, ever … I can guarantee you one thing, though: If you cut my arm, I guarantee cardinal and gold are coming out.”
His tenure at USC thus far, however, has not occurred under ideal circumstances, as he’s had to work during an unprecedented time: The coronavirus pandemic put the sports world to a screeching halt in his first full semester at USC. Bohn said in a tweet March 12 that “informing our student-athletes and coaches that they can no longer compete is the hardest message I’ve ever had to deliver.”
“My heart aches for our student-athletes, for our country, for our community, for our entire institution, for Los Angeles, for our conference, for all the people that are key partners in putting together a viable intercollegiate athletic program,” Bohn said. “I’m a student-athlete-centric AD, and any time your athletes are hurting, you’re hurting.”
Cockrell echoed Bohn’s words when discussing her experience at the 2020 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships, which were canceled after USC athletes had arrived at the meet in Albuquerque, N.M.
“We were already at the meet and [the athletic department] figured out how to get us home that same day,” Cockrell said. “[The amount of] communication there’s been with everything going on has been really impressive.”
Cockrell also applauded the department’s decision to honor financial and scholarship aid to spring student-athlete seniors who choose to accept their additional year of eligibility.
The pandemic has led to concerns about the status of the upcoming college football season, but Bohn remains unfazed by the possibility of any sort of cancellation and optimistic about USC’s prospects.
“I just hope we have an opportunity to compete, but we’re gonna have a good football team if we can stay healthy,” Bohn said. “We have lofty goals for this year. Whether we can get into the [College Football Playoff], I don’t know. Obviously, the goal is to get to the Rose Bowl or higher, and I know that’s how our young men and coaches are thinking in that football program.”
A Rose Bowl appearance would require a Pac-12 Championship win and has not historically been an unusual goal (USC has made 34 appearances in the bowl game, more than any other school). But the fact that Bohn — who has yet to go through a full football season as USC’s athletic director — has already decided on an expectation shared by members of the football program despite two straight relatively underperforming seasons is indicative of the ambition he’s shown since taking over the job.
“Mike has been ultra supportive from day one,” head football coach Clay Helton said. “I’ve always thought that a first impression is key, and when he walked in [to my office] and offered [his] support, it was a terrific first impression.”
At the introductory press conference, Bohn responded to any potential football coaching changes by saying “Good programs finish strong.” Of the four games he presided over as athletic director, USC won three, with the sole loss coming in the Holiday Bowl against Iowa.
Social media nonetheless went into a frenzy when Bohn tweeted 11 days after USC’s win over UCLA that Helton would stay on as head coach of the program. While the decision was criticized by many, it was consistent with Bohn’s words at the first press conference.
“His support down the stretch of this season was one of the reasons we finished so strong,” Helton said. “He was a part of our team.”
Being the athletic director for any school in a Power Five conference is no easy task, especially with a blueblood football program, a fanbase with high expectations and a department previously embroiled in endless scandals. But for Mike Bohn, the ideal Trojan attributes are embodied in his approach to the position: resiliency, honesty and success.
“Anything that’s worth keeping score of, we want to be first,” Bohn said. “Is that a lofty goal? You’re darn right, it is a lofty goal. But if we’re going to keep score, we want to win.”

When you write about music, work in “the industry” or are just a general listener and want to stay up to date on what’s new, Fridays are dreadful. According to Wired, the Friday music release became standard around 2016. As the industry saw an increase in streaming, it needed to optimize the way it released music and curb piracy concerns brought on by staggered release dates. Similar to the reason movies come out on Fridays, fans are also typically more willing to buy music on the weekends. 
The new normal that is the Friday release should be a blessing in disguise for anyone working in a music-related job, right? Your brain works on a schedule. For a writer, Fridays bring opportunities to write reviews, think pieces or listicles or get some funny tweets out. 
For industry professionals — college street team workers, marketing executives, A&Rs, etc. — it’s the moment they’ve been waiting for. One’s label or artist’s project is out and though a successful single or album is more than just its reception at the release, it’s how it sustains and grows after it: Half of the battle is done once the music is published. 
As someone who has worked in both capacities, in the industry and as a writer, I’ve always hated the Friday release. In an early music-related gig, I’d scoff at having to write mundane news articles about City Girls’ latest single or whatever random joint-album (see: “MihTy”) the industry conceived of that week. There was rarely any thrill associated with the cyclical nature of waiting for new-music Fridays.  
Yes, I’d get a rush for highly-anticipated albums such as Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter V” as I worked on an overarching news piece about the years of hype leading up to the project, but for most other releases, engaging with them felt formulaic. Like cleaning the bathroom, I’d come to work every Friday with my Fabulouso and scrubbing brush, ready to get down and dirty writing about whatever music dropped that day. 
Today, as a self-proclaimed music-writer and hip-hop lover, I’m still tired. At some point in many of my conversations with friends on the final day of the work week, I’m asked: “Have you listened to the new *insert artist name who dropped on Friday*?” The answer varies. 
I remember attempting to do an entire weave on myself in my junior year and waiting to persevere through the hardest part  — sewing in my tracks  —  until Meek Mill’s “Championships” dropped. Consequently, it was an amazing feat on my part, my hair turned out perfect and the album is one I still listen to now when overcoming challenging tasks (like doing sprints outside, instead of on the treadmill during the quarantine). 
Yet, over the past few years, my answer to the question has shifted from the affirmative to outright disregarding what’s just dropped. I’ve grown tired of being “in the know” or listening to music as soon as it’s out. If you asked me today about newer releases, you’d learn I haven’t listened to any of my usual pickings. DaBaby’s album is foreign to me, I’ve only listened to three or four tracks from Fiona Apple’s new project and my ears have yet to hear the collaborative effort by Tom Misch and Yussef Dayes. 
I’m not sure if I’ve become a lazy music consumer, too accustomed to the luxury streaming provides, listening to Amerie’s “All I Have” every day. Or, maybe I’m just no longer interested in today’s musical landscape — music and content produced alike.
It seems like conversations surrounding albums are touch and go. I want to have hour-long discussions with my friends debating the production on Westside Gunn’s latest, but with every Friday slapping me with more to consume, where is the time for it?
My entire Twitter timeline talks about a project from late Thursday night to about Wednesday of the next week and then we gear up for another round of releases. Yes, there’s lots of music that stands the test of time; I’m still talking about how underrated “K.T.S.E.” is to this day. Though if I solely based my music consumption and engagement on what was popular on social media or music journalism sites, I’d listen to something once or twice and trade it for the next release without full digestion.  
I want discussions around artists’ work to last longer. It seems like many listen to music to say they’ve listened, as opposed to listening to enjoy or better understand the work. Reviews from some major music publications seem formulaic, and long-gone are the days when writers would explore themes and motifs deeply rooted in an album after it’s marinated with the world and had a chance to mean something. It bothers me that talented, hardworking artists can sit in the studio for months or years on end and create something that is digested and tossed away so quickly but brought back for quick listicle or end-of-the-year roundups. 
Nineteen years ago, when Jay-Z said, (yes, another Jay-Z reference in an “Everything but the Song” column) “Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?” he was asking an important question: Are we actually listening to what’s being rapped or sung about? Are we deciphering the instrumentation of a track? Or are we listening because we have to, because it’s the right or expected thing to do?

“Stuck in Love”
In the same vein of “The Spectacular Now” and “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” this movie drips in nostalgia — a feeling I, and likely many others, have been experiencing more acutely during quarantine. 
The movie, as it eponymously implies, is about being stuck — in love, in the past, in our routines, in the stubborn ways we do things and live our lives. In its relatively short 96-minute runtime, the film touches on several themes: change, denial, healing, the passage of time, second chances, self-determination, hope and trust. 
“Stuck in Love” speaks volumes with nuance and minimalism, and it shouts from the rooftops while remaining quiet, observant and vulnerable. The film plays out like a pang in the heart, and it accomplishes its goal of being both cynical and romantic without trying too hard. Simply put, “Stuck in Love” lets you feel sad when you need to wallow in melancholy and gives you hope when you desperately need it.
For good reason, this film shaped me as a teenager, as did Raymond Carver’s “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” referenced in the closing scene. Don’t even get me started on its soundtrack and the way it arguably transformed a whole generation into still-yearning adolescents on Tumblr. ’Twas a cultural reset, so I’ll give it a pass for being as painfully white as it is. 
Ultimately, this movie is a love letter to many things — namely love (bet you didn’t see that one coming), weed (sorry, couldn’t resist) and damn good literature. The perfect blend of humor and sadness, “Stuck in Love” is the quintessential movie to describe the concurrent, fleeting whirlwind of emotions you’re probably experiencing right now.

“Set It Up” 
I’m not normally one to buy into those movies about being swept up into whirlwind city romances. And I’d never really understood the romantic appeal of a place as crowded, noisy and fast-paced as New York City — that is, until I watched this movie the summer before my freshman year at USC. 
Since then, “Set It Up” has been a go-to of mine for anything from Friday night hangouts with friends to snapping myself out of late-night sad girl hours; that is why I’ve watched it three times (so far) while stuck in quarantine. 
While it’s not the most nuanced story, this light-hearted rom-com is loveable in so many ways. Chief among them is the natural chemistry between actors Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. Their characters, Harper and Charlie, have delightfully witty banter throughout the film, and it’s sweet to watch their mutual annoyance for one another slowly grow into a friendship and eventual romantic attraction.
I also fall back on this movie because of its truly eclectic soundtrack, full of oldies ranging from The Del-Vikings’ 1957 “Come Go With Me,” to Martha Reeves and the Vandellas’ 1965 “Nowhere to Run” and Dire Straits’ 1981 “Romeo and Juliet.” From doo-wop and R&B to roots rock, the carefully curated tracks in “Set It Up” speak to love and its innumerable forms across the decades. 
But what really brings me back to this movie is its emphasis on quality connection and time well spent with the people that matter most. Whether you’re from a major city like New York or not, it’s bittersweet to be reminded of how most of us would be enjoying late spring and early summer. From lazy afternoons spent by the pool and nighttime rooftop parties to baseball games and leisurely walks with friends, “Set It Up” makes me nostalgic for what could have been but hopeful that better times are on the horizon.

“The Defiant Ones” 
I don’t read self-help books. I grew up with “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,” learning about perseverance and self-realization from Maya Angelou’s narrative. Listening to the stories of my father rigorously studying for the bar exam and almost having to repeat his third year of law school was my version of “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” or “The 48 Laws of Power.”  
The stories of real people are far more empowering than pop psychology books, at least for me. I want to be inspired, not lectured. 
The lives and careers of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre, as told in HBO’s four-part documentary series “The Defiant Ones,” is one of those stories. For those who don’t know about one of music’s most prolific friendships, Iovine and Dre are responsible for Dre’s album “The Chronic,” songs by N.W.A., 2Pac, Eminem, 50 Cent and many other creative endeavors. 
Though well past their 50s, Dre and Iovine are cool, to put it plainly. They’ve worked with everyone and say all the right things about pushing past fears, getting serious about your craft and working smart, not hard. Instead of a lecture from a professor about the importance of hard work, “The Defiant Ones” is a fitting title for a relaxed but motivating watch that forces the viewer to think about turning their dreams into powerful realities by defying traditional rationale. 
Moments where Iovine tells the story of working on Bruce Springsteen’s iconic “Born to Run” album or Dre discusses his early beginnings working with turntables and making beats will strike with those feeling stuck or uninspired during this quarantine. Through archival footage, bits of the two recounting dicey career moves paired with eerily perfect music placement, the series will leave you in awe of how two men from humble beginnings created a legacy.

“My Life as a Zucchini” 
I signed up for the Criterion Channel after I saw French director Céline Sciamma’s 2019 feature “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” for the nth time in the theater pre-pandemic. Her other works, including “Water Lilies” and “Tomboy,” dove into themes of sexuality, femininity and androgyny with such delicacy that as she gave herself to her films, I was returning a piece of myself by watching. 
Sciamma’s work is unique in that its simplicity heightens the senses, especially her minimal scoring and long takes as characters take in one another. So when I was browsing her other credits and saw that she wrote the screenplay for the stop-motion feature “My Life as a Zucchini,” which was nominated for the 2017 Oscar for Best Animated Feature, I had to take a look to see a different side of her.
The film’s marketing as a family movie might not surprise the French-Swiss industry it was born of, but it handles issues such as addiction, abuse and loss in a way that leaves you speechless as much as it does your parents. Courgette (the French word for zucchini) arrives at an orphanage after the loss of his mother and meets other children who have seen their parents arrested, overdose or leave. I will be honest, it gets grim at some points, but being able to see the world through a child’s sensibility, with its vulnerability and unbounded optimism, left me with happy tears in its wake.
“My Life as a Zucchini” doesn’t leave me confused, rushing to the internet to find out at which exact point I got lost in its meaning. It is an incredibly simple and sweet look at childhood, friendship and family, offering the perfect sense of companionship that envelopes you when you need it most.

Our government’s response to the 2008 recession was something of a travesty. Then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson gave $700 billion to big banks, with very little oversight on how those funds should be used. As a result, the banks survived with their executives receiving an enormous bonuses, while 4 million families had their homes foreclosed to recoup the banks’ losses. That’s millions of people dislocated in the trough of a recession.  
Since the beginning of the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis, the process has been similarly corrupt, with senators dumping stocks before the markets tanked. An early version of the Republican bailout even tried to hide the recipients of loans for six months, keeping the flow of money a mystery until it had already been spent. If our government is not already a kleptocracy, then it clearly wants to be one.   
The major mistake in 2008 was letting a single person, the treasury secretary, dispense billions at their discretion, and the mistake has been repeated with current bailouts. Once again, $2 trillion has been entrusted to a single man, with minuscule oversight on his allocations and few rules for how corporations should use the funds. 
The situation becomes downright terrifying when we consider who that man is: Steven Mnuchin, an unelected former Goldman Sachs banker who earned the title “Foreclosure King” during the 2008 recession. He made over $200 million by buying a failing mortgage lender and foreclosing on thousands of people –– including a 90-year-old woman for a 27-cent payment discrepancy. 
This was not just unethical businessmanship: Mnuchin broke the law, racking up 1,000 violations in his time leading OneWest Bank. It is a miracle that he’s not in prison, let alone at the helm of a fund 1/10th the size of the U.S. gross domestic product. 
Like 2008, the treasury secretary has near unmitigated control over the funds. “There’s nobody that Secretary Mnuchin has to ask,” California Rep. Katie Porter has warned. There is little preventing the secretary from, say, directing billions to Trump properties and corporations owned by friends, while hospitals, states and individuals bear the brunt of the crisis. 
The kind of leeway that allowed banks to foreclose on millions in 2008 is no less unchecked this time around. Though there are limits on stock buybacks, bonuses for executives and other means of profiting off the crisis, Mnuchin can waive them as he desires. 
We are already seeing the results of Mnuchin’s carte blanche of the bailout funds. Our response tends to corporate needs first, giving them tax cuts and billions of dollars with few strings attached. 
While corporations are made whole, individual plights are lightly acknowledged with $1,200 bailouts that may take four months to reach people –– and which the Treasury has allowed banks to seize to satisfy outstanding debts.   
The current downturn far outstrips the magnitude of the 2008 recession, with an unprecedented 10 million applicants for unemployment benefits in March. The crisis requires a response that recognizes a struggle felt most desperately on an individual level. Instead, our government is repeating the mistakes of 2008, allocating the people’s money away from the people.

While finishing up hectic finals schedules and trying to sort out summer plans, it can be tempting to only focus  on when this will be over –– when students can return to campus, see their friends again and resume “normal” activities. Given how all-consuming the news surrounding the pandemic has become, it’s no surprise that the focus remains how to get through it. Everyone wants this to be over soon. But, it is equally important to document the small ways the virus has impacted everyday life — to recognize and record its effects. By writing, journaling and creating, students can play a role in the collection of history. 
Museums across the world are asking people to document how the coronavirus has impacted their lives. In New York, the historical society is asking for photographs, drawings, objects and stories connected to the people of the city and around the globe. People have already sent in photos of empty city streets, workers in protective gear, the making and distribution of masks and hand sanitizer and drawings hanging in home windows. There are also testimonials, stories, art projects and more — anything that will help the museum build a future digital exhibit about life during a pandemic. 
While photographs and digital media serve as a visual representation of history, journaling and writing may be an even more permanent method of documentation. Journaling holds many benefits, allowing for relaxation and a moment of calm in an otherwise stressful environment. Even spending just five or 10 minutes reflecting on personal emotions or thoughts may help provide a little relief from anxiety. Writing is proven to be therapeutic and can aid in improving mood, the immune system and memory.
Throughout history, journaling has also become one of the most trusted and reliable formats historians use to understand the full picture of a certain time period. Students immediately recognize the story of Anne Frank, whose writing has become a pivotal part of learning about World War II. Likewise, personal writing from times of conflict, war, civil and political change or deadly disease presents one of the most valuable historical assets.
But no matter the medium, be it writing or photography, this period in history is no different. In 50 years, it will be necessary for students to learn about this time. What better way as college students, as creators and creatives, to be a part of this process than to document it? 
Students at USC are already recording new aspects of their lives at home by continuing to create. Across departments, social media has become a space for students to share their work and remain connected to the University community. On Instagram, Annenberg Media reporters still deliver the news. Roski School of Art and Design majors have adapted their projects: some ceramics students are making gifs to display class pieces. Glorya Kaufman School of Dance students just concluded virtual senior project presentations and dancers continue producing shared works by performing separately at home and assembling footage into a finished collaborative piece. Thornton School of Music students similarly adapted by sharing online performances and are even planning to hold an online music festival in May. At the Iovine and Young Academy, students and faculty are working to design and print 3D face masks and distribute them to medical workers. 
Simply by harnessing their skills and creativity, students are showcasing the ways in which ingenuity has evolved and thrived. These projects will be pivotal in remembering life during a pandemic. 
Continue making, creating and working. And when there is a moment of calm, write it down. If there is any time to rest while figuring out how to survive this, there is a strong case for using that time to document how this virus has changed work, life and the creation of art. Whatever comes out of this pandemic will be a marker of this particular time in history — one we and future generations will want to look back on some day.
